CMS is the Cen-ters for Medicare and Medicaid Services and they have defined \"Meaningful Use\" in the following way: the use of certified electronic health reco rd (EHR) technology for the electronic exchan ge of health infor- mation in a meaningful manner in order to improve the quality of health care. Mean- ingful Use is a federal initiative and re- quires that progress be assessed through the use of clinical and interoperability quality measures. Meaningful Use involv es three stages and currently is in Stage 1: Capture and Share data. In order to participate, eligible pro- viders and hospitals must meet 15 manda-tory objectives and at least five from a list of 10 optional items, including at least one Public Health objective. The Public Health (PH) objectives include: 1) exchanging immunization registry data; 2) sending electronic laboratory results (ELR); and 3) sending syndromic surveillance informa- tion to PH agencies. While eligible pro- viders may only select the immunization registry and syndromic surveillance op- tions, eligible hospitals may select any of the PH options. Currently, the Tennessee Department of Health (TDOH) is exchanging immuniza-tion registry data and accepting ELR using interoperability standards outlined in the Meaningful Use objectives.

It combines the viru- lence properties of two different diarrhea- causing E. coli pathotypes: typical entero- aggregative E. coli, known for its ability to stick to cells in the intestine, and Shiga (Continued on page 2) Beginning in May 2011, Robert Koch In-stitute, the German federal institution re- sponsible for disease control and preven- tion, together with other federal and state authorities for health and food safety in Germany have been investigating a large outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing Es- cherichia coli O104:H4 (STEC O104:H4) infections. Most infections were reported among people who reside in or had re-cently visited northern Germany. As of September 2011, Germany and 15 other countries have reported 3,842 cases, in-cluding 53 fatalities. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) -a type of kidney failure that is associated with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli - was diagnosed in 855 people, roughly 22%. There are important differences between this outbreak and previ- ous large outbreaks of Shiga-toxin producing E. coli infection. First, HUS represents nearly a quar-ter of the reported cases, in contrast to the 5 %\u201410 % typically seen in outbreaks. Second, ap- proximately 90% of those HUS cases oc- curred in adults rather than in children, with the majority occurring in women. Third, the implicared pathogen was a non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli strain in- stead of the more commonly seen Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157:H7 . STEC O104:H4 has several genetic factors that X TB: W HAT GOES UP MUST COME DOWN ............................ 4 HUS and STEC O104:H4 Tennesseeepi-newsTennessee Epi-News Page and STEC International Travelers Beware: Measles on European Tour toxin-producing E. coli, known for its abil- ity to make Shiga toxin. These two proper- ties together suggest that the pathogen in the current outbreak is exceptionally viru- lent. The final important difference in this outbreak is the eight day median incuba- tion period in contrast to the typical three- four day incubation period reported for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli O157:H7. In the United States, six confirmed cases, including one death from STEC O104:H4 infection have been reported. Of these (Continued from page 1) cases, all but one recently traveled to Ger-many and the one non-traveler likely ac- quired infection through close contact with another case. The Robert Koch Institute has determined that contaminated raw sprouts, produced by a farm in Germany, were the likely source of the outbreak, and public health authorities even recommended that people in Germany not eat raw sprouts of any origin. Trace-back investigations indi- cated that no sprouts or other food items from the implicated farm have been ex- ported outside Germany. \u2014 by Marcy McMillian, MPH \u0099 objects. Ill persons can transmit virus as early as five days before rash onset through four days after rash onset. Susceptible contacts may become ill and develop the measles rash up to 18 days after exposure to a case. It is diagnosed by a positive IgM measles anti-body titer. MMR vaccine is safe and highly prevent- ing measles and its compli- cations. MMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children at age 12-15 months, with a second dose at age four-six years. For adults born in 1957 or later who have no evidence of immunity to measles, one dose of MMR vaccine is routinely recommended; two doses are recom- mended for certain adults in high-risk groups (e.g., health care personnel, interna- tional travelers, or students at post-high school educational institutions). It is essen-tial to vaccinate susc eptible travelers to prevent illness and measles importations to the U.S. Exposures might occur in a vari-ety of settings, including airports. All sus- ceptible travelers going outside the U.S. and aged six months are eligible to re- ceive MMR vaccine and should be vacci- nated before travel. Sustained measles transmission in the U.S. was interrupted over a decade ago, due largely to high vaccination coverage do- mestically and in countries commonly vis-ited by U.S. travelers. Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that can lead to serious complications in up to 30% of cases. In 2011, 30 European countries and the US have reported dramatic increases in incidence. France was particularly hard hit, with over 10,000 cases reported during January-April. 89% of U.S. cases have been associated with importation from other countries. For example, of Tennes- see's three confirmed cases in 2011, one was imported from France and spread to one contact in Tennessee, and one patient was infected before traveling to the US from India. Measles is characterized by high fever, cough, and runny nose, followed in one- four days by conjunctivitis and a red rash that spreads from the head to the extremi-ties. White spots on the buccal mucosa, known as Koplik's spots also occur, but may not be recognized easily by all clini-cians. Complications can include pneumo- nia, encephalitis, seizures and death. Up to 90% of susceptible persons develop mea-sles following exposure. A susceptible person can be infected after entering a room as long as two hours after a measles patient leaves, though the virus typically survives less than two hours in air or on If you suspect measles illness in a suscepti- ble patient, particularly with a history of recent international travel, isolate the pa- tient using airborne precautions (or place in a private room with the door closed) and immediately contact your local health de- partment for assistance with the measles assessment and possible testing. Prompt recognition and follow-up of ex-posed contacts (including vaccination of susceptible contacts within three days of exposure) are essential to minimize the risk of an outbreak. \u2014 by Robb Garman, MPH, and Kelly L.

White-Nose Syndrome in Tennessee Bats Hibernating bat populations in several states and Canadian pr ovinces are at risk with the emerging di sease of white-nose syndrome (WNS). First appearing in up-state New York in the winter of 2006-07, (Continued on page 3) Tennessee Epi-News Page 3 tors resistant gonorrhea at 28 U.S. sites, and the World Health Organization considers re- sistance in gonorrhea to be a global concern on the level of multi-drug resistant tuberculo-sis, typhoid, and malaria. CDC recommends those infected with gonor-rhea be treated concurrently for chlamydia because of high co-infection rates. To miti- gate resistance and increase the efficacy of cephalosporin treatment, the CDC addition- ally recommends that anyone with sexual contact with someone diagnosed with gonor-rhea be treated for both infections. Gonorrhea can cause many complications including infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and sterility, and babies can be infected during birth. Since 1985, gonorrhea, a bacterium spread during sexual contact, has become resistant to three classes of medication: tetracycline, penicillin, and quinolones It alters either itself or the structure of the medication. There are signs of growing resistance to azithromycin, and cephalosporins are the only class of medication remaining to treat gonorrhea with a single, inexpensive injec- tion. When cephalosporins cease to be effective, an infected patient would need to be hospi-talized for treatment with IV antibiotics. Medication resistance in gonorrhea has historically originated in Far East Asia and spreads both west and east. New cepha- losporin resistance as close as Norway and Hawaii has been documented. CDC moni- Because of the high number of repeat infections, patients with gonorrhea should be asked to return in three-six months for another test. Although gonorrhea incidence has been decreasing in the U.S. and TN since the 1980s, TN remains far from meeting the Healthy People 2010 goal of 19.0 cases/100,000 population. In 2009, TN ranked 13 th among states with a case rate of 128.3 cases and Shelby County #7 among metropolitan statistical areas with a case rate of 422.0. \u2014 by Laurie Anderson (Revised 04/20/2012) \u0099 Outsmarting the Medication White-Nose Syndrome in Te nnessee Bats (continued) the fungus thought to cause WNS has spread southward to Tennessee and west-ward to Oklahoma. At the end of the 2010- 2011 hibernating season, bats with WNS were found in 16 states and four provinces. Currently, 11 cave-hibernating bat species, including four endangered species and subspecies, are affected or at risk. More than half of the 45 bat species in the U.S. depend on hibernation for winter survival. WNS has killed millions of bats in eastern North America. In some hibernacula, the mortality rate is 90 to 100 percent. As a result, several species of bats that hibernate may become endangered or extinct. Bats, considered to be nature's insecticide, eat tremendous numbers of flying pest insects. The large-scale loss of bat populations is likely to increase the use of chemical pesti- cides substantially and have long-term effects on agricultural economies and eco-system integrity. Tennessee participates in WNS surveillance by providing bats for testing in a project sponsored by the Na-(Continued from page 2) tional Park Service and the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia. Researchers associate WNS with a newly identified fungus ( Geomyces destructans ) that thrives in the cold, humid conditions characteristic of caves and mines used as hibernacula. Bats affected by WNS during winter months may lose fat reserves and exhibit atypical behaviors such as flying outside during the day and clustering near hibernacula entrances. In early 2010, the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) received confirmation that two bats hibernating in Worley's Cave in Sulli-van County tested positive for the WNS fungus. Additional occurrences have been recorded in caves in Blount, Carter, Fen-tress, Montgomery, and Van Buren coun- ties. Scientists believe WNS is spread primarily bat-to-bat, but it is also plausible that fun-gus may be transferred from infected caves or mines on the clothing, gear, or footwear of humans. In an effort to slow the spread of WNS among Tennessee's bat popula-tion, public access to caves, sinkholes, tunnels, and abandoned mines on state- owned public land has been closed since July 1, 2009. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, U.S. Forest Service, Tennessee Val- ley Authority, and The Nature Conser-vancy have also closed caves on their lands to public access. \u2014 by David E. Brumley, DDS, MPH \u0099 Norovirus in Congregate Settings Substantial advances have been made in our understanding of norovirus epidemiol- ogy, immunology, diagnostic methods and infection control. CDC recently published Updated Norovirus Outbreak Management and Disease Prevention Guidelines . Nev- ertheless, norovirus remains the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis in U.S. hospi- tals, nursing homes, outpatient clinics and emergency departments. Norovirus can be transmitted by food, wa- ter and contaminated environmental sur-faces, as well as directly from person to person. There is no lasting immunity to norovirus; outbreaks can occur in a variety of congregate settings. The potential for seeing multiple routes of transmission within an outbreak further complicate dis- ease prevention efforts. (Continued on page 4) Tennessee Epi-News Page 4 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently made the biggest change to fuel economy Transportation is the single largest source of air pollution in the Southeast. Two im- portant air pollutants that threaten health are ground-level ozone and fine particle pollution. Ozone forms in the atmosphere, typically on hot, dry summer days. Ozone can irritate and inflame airways, and at high levels can cause shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, or pain. Particle pollution can be produced year-round. Microscopic fine particles can be breathed deeply into the lungs. People exposed to high levels of particle pollution may experience dyspnea, coughing, chest discomfort, wheezing, and shortness of breath. labels since they were introduced 35 years ago. The redesigned labels provide fuel economy, energy use, fu el costs, and envi- ronmental impacts. For the first time, comparable fuel economy and environ- mental ratings will be available all for ve- hicles, including gas-electric hybrids and plug-in electric cars. Consumers will have the best information to help save on fuel costs and reduce emissions. Scientific studies have connected poor air quality to adverse health outcomes and mortality. A UCLA study revealed that the smallest particles from vehicle emissions (Continued on page 5) Transportation, Air Pollution, and Public Health Norovirus in Congregate Settings (continued) Norovirus and other closely related caliciviruses infect only humans and have a low infectious dose. Appropriate hand hygiene and exclusion/isolation of infected persons are the most practical means of interrupting transmission of the virus and limiting contamination of the environment. Separation of exposed and unexposed well persons might also be useful during out- breaks to help break the cycle of transmis- sion. Ill staff members in food service set- tings should be excluded during their ill- ness and for 48 hours following resolution of symptoms. Finally, the use of chemical disinfectants is one of the key approaches to interrupting norovirus spread via contaminated envi- ronmental surfaces. The efficacy of chlo-rine bleach has been well documented. Particular attention should be given to bathrooms and high-touch surfaces like door knobs and hand rails.

Because of his close contact with other employees of this Kentucky air ambulance company, patients, and family, as well as a lengthy infectious period, April- December 2010, the investigation was complex. TB risk assessments were conducted to determine likelihood of exposure and need for testing. TB skin tests were placed, and contacts with positive test results under- went chest x-rays. Employees testing posi- tive were also offered testing by Quan-tiFERON\u00ae Gold (QFT-G , manufactured by Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Victoria, Australia). Forty-eight contacts were tested, including six in the patient's household, 38 in his workplace, and fo ur in a clinic setting. Six others were identified as contacts but were not tested by TB skin test because of a past positive skin test, and one contact had be- come clinically ill. There were eight (18.6%) TB skin test conversions, though none among clinic contacts. The conversion rate was a remarkable 67% for household and 13% for the workplace. Ten contacts are currently on treatment for latent tuberculosis infection. Collaboration across state lines and with various healthcare entities was critical in locating, testing, and treating contacts. Testing demonstrated likely transmission in the household and workplace and points to the need for continued vigilance and education around TB control. \u2014 by Jason Cummins, MPH \u0099 Tennessee Epi-News Page 5 Change in Reportable Diseases Effective January 2012 Reported Cases, by Year of Diagnosis, Tennessee, 2007-2011 Condition 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Chlamydia 26969 27939 7453 Meningococcal 13 9 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), invasive 1973 1988 1954 1610 1671 Pertussis 74 120 203 226 94 Spotted Fever Rickettsiosis 188 231 187 307 259 Salmonella , non-Typhi 852 923 779 969 996 Shiga-toxin producing E . coli (STEC) 118 113 86 116 104 Syphilis 1207 1271 1316 1130 878 Tuberculosis (TB) 235 282 210 193 156 Pediatric TB 0-4 yrs 4 13 5 11 2 Pediatric TB 5-15 yrs 7 2 6 2 6 Reportable diseases are those diseases or conditions described in Tennessee law that are required to be reported to local and state health departments. Descrip- tions, reporting procedures, patient fact sheets, and other information are con- tained in the new Tennessee Department of Health communicable disease manual on-line. This can be viewed at the follow- ing website: http://health.state.tn.us/ReportableDiseases/Default.aspx. Healthcare providers and laboratories should alert the health department of sus-pected cases or positive laboratory results for these reportable diseases. The list of approximately 90 reportable diseases is maintained by the Communicable and Environmental Disease Services section, under the authority of the Commissioner of Health. The list is evaluated and up- dated annually and typically republished each January. The 2012 version contains minor changes to disease names and re- porting categories. As mentioned above, clinical laboratories are required to report positive results and to submit selected culture isolates to the Department of Health Laboratory Ser-vices. Public health laboratory surveil- lance can include confirmation, typing, and/or antibiotic sensitivity testing of cul-ture isolates.
