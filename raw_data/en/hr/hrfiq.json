They build antibodies to help prevent diseases. xImmunization is safe. It is much safer to get immunized than to get these diseases. What is the influenza vaccine? The influenza vaccine protects against the influenza virus. What is influenza? Influenza is an infection of the nose, throat, and lungs that is caused by a virus. Symptoms start suddenly and may include: xa fever and chills xa sore th roat or cough xa headache xmuscle ac hes xnot feeling hungry or not wanting to eat (poor app etite) xfeeling tired Other symptoms may include feeling sick to your stomach (nause a), vomiting (throwing up), or having loose stool (diarrhea). These ar e more common in young children. In some cases, influenza can lead to a lung infection (pneumonia) or make other health problems worse. Even healthy, young people can get very sick or die from influenza. The number of people who get sick with influenza is different year to year. On average each year, more than 12,000 people in Canada have to stay in a hospital because of influenza and 3,500 people die from it . How does it spread? Influenza can spread in the following ways: xAn infected person sneezes, coughs, or even talks. xYou breathe in the virus. xYou touch something that has the virus on it (such as hands or a door knob), then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. You can spread influenza before symptoms start. How can I stop influenza from spreading? To stop influenza from spreading: xGet the influenza vaccine every year. xWash your hands with warm water and soap or use an alcohol- based hand sanitizer often. xCover your cough or sneeze into your arm or a tissue, not yourhand. xStay home when you are sick.Who should get the influenza vaccine? Everyone is at risk of influenza. You s hould get the influenza vaccine if you are age 6 months or older. Influenza can make you very sick and lead to other health problems, especially if: xYou have heart or lung conditions, diabetes, a weak immune system, a lot of extra weight, or other health problems. xYou live in a care facility, such as a nursing hom e. xYou are under age 5 years. xYou are age 65 years or older. xYou are pregnant. xYou are an Indigenous person. It is important to get the influenza vaccine each year, espe cially if: xYou have a high risk of getting very sick from infl uenza. xYou have close contact with someone who is at high risk of gettingvery sick from influenza, such as family members and caregivers. xYou are a healthcare provider. (Getting the vaccine helps to prote ct you and the people you care for. ) The va ccine is free if you live, work, go to school, or are visiting in Alberta. How many doses do I need? If you are under age 9 years, the first time you get the influenza vaccine you will need 2 doses, at least 4 weeks apart. Everyone else only needs 1 dose of the influenza vaccine each influenza season. The season starts in late fall and lasts through the winter. Are there different types of influenza vaccines? There are many types of influenza vaccines. Every year, Alberta Health looks at information about influenza to help them decide which vaccines to offer for free. High-dose and standard-dose influenza vaccine If you are age 65 years and older, you are at high risk for serious illness from influenza. Because your immune system changes as you age, you may not respond to immunization as well as younger people. That is why people age 65 years and older get the high-dose inactivated (killed) influenza vaccine. The high-dose vaccine has more inactivated influenza virus than the regular (standard-dose) vaccine. The higher dose means that you will have a better response to the vaccine to protect you against influenza. If you are under age 65 years, you will get the standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccine. Both vaccines protect against 4 types of influenza virus. Your healthcare provider will let you know which vaccine you can get. Nasal spray The nasal spray influenza vaccine may be available to buy from a pharmacist. If you want the nasal spray, ask your pharmacist if it is right for you, and talk to them about side effects, effectiveness, doses, and any other questions you have. The nasal spray is not offered for free in Alberta. You can check with your health insurance provider to see if they cover the cost. Page 2 of 2, Side AHow well does the vaccine work? How well the vaccine works is different each influenza season. A new vaccine is made every year to protect against the 3 or 4 influenza viruses that are most likely to make you sick. Even when the vaccine does not exactly match the viruses that spread where you live, it can still help protect you from getting influenza or getting very sick from it. The influenza vaccine is the best way to lower your risk of getting influenza and having related health problems. It can also help stop you from spreading it to others. The influenza vaccine will start to protect you about 2 weeks after you get it. Where can I get the influenza vaccine? Children under age 5 years and their families can get the influenza vaccine for free at Alberta Health Services influenza immunization clinics. Clinics are usually open from mid to late October to the end of March. To find influenza immunization clinics where you live or to book an appointment, visit ahs.ca/influenza or call Health Link at 811. You can also get the influenza vaccine from many family doctors and pharmacists. xPharmacists give the influenza vaccine to anyone age 5 years and older. xFamily doctors give the influenza vaccine to anyone age 6 months and older. Call your doctor or pharmacist to find out if they offer the vaccine. If you want a type of influenza vaccine that is not free, you may be able to buy it at a pharmacy. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if it is right for you. You can also check with your health insurance provider to see if they cover the cost. Are there side effects from the influenza vaccine? There can be side effects from the influenza vaccine, but they tend to be mild and go away in a few days. Side effects may include: xredness, swelling, bruising, a hard spot, or feeling sore where you had the needle xcrying or getting upset easily xfeeling tired or unwell xa headache xa fever or chills xbody aches or sore joints xa poor appetite xnausea, stomach pain, vomiting, or diarrhea At least 1 out of 100 people who got this vaccine reported 1 or more of these side effects. In some cases, it is unknown if the vaccine caused these side effects It is important to stay at the clinic for 15 minutes after your vaccine.

If you have been told to dothis, call your doctor even if you think the fever is from the vaccine. What if I had or am getting another type of vaccine? You can get the influenza vaccine at the same time, any time before, or any time after most vaccines. However, certain vaccines have a waiting period. If you had another vaccine in the last 2 weeks, check with your healthcare provider about when you can get the influenza vaccine. Who should not get the influenza vaccine?
