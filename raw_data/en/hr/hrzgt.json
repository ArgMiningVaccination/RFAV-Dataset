There is a considerable body of [scientific evidence to support its effectiveness](https://www.danicaapolline.co.uk/scientific-evidence-for-homeopathy). Before I can explain what homeopathy is, and how I think it works, I need to take us back to a very basic understanding from science - the atom.......and more specifically some crucial information about the atom that we weren't taught at school! The following extracts are taken from my book [Nature's Medicine Code.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Natures-Medicine-Code-Food-About/dp/095757214X) A Sojourn into Science You may think of yourself as solid, dense, physical matter, but actually all of us are mainly made up of space. This is how. We are physically made up of atoms. They look like this. The physical matter of an atom is its nucleus - that bit in the centre - the rest surrounding it is energy. That physical matter in an atom only accounts for 1% of the atom - the other 99% is space - or energy. So that means that you, as something made of atoms, is therefore 1% physical matter and 99% space. Marcus Chown in his book [Quantum Theory Cannot Hurt You](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2330343.Quantum_Theory_Cannot_Hurt_You), gives the amazing statistic that, if all of the space within atoms and between atoms was removed, 99.99% of the entire population of the world - 99.99% of over 7 billion of us - would fit into the size of a sugar cube. Amazing, isn't it?! So what is that space filled with? It is filled with energy. How do we know there is this pool of energy? Dogs can hear sounds that we can't hear. Infrared light is a light frequency that we can't see with our physical eyes, but science measures sound frequencies and light frequencies that we as humans can't experience with our physical bodies. These frequencies are an expression of energy. So there is so much energy - so many frequency vibrations - that we don't experience physically but that we can measure and so know exist. The world is made of more than we can physically sense. These frequencies that we can't see or hear don't just exist outside of ourselves, they exist within us too. Your thoughts, your feelings and your beliefs live in the energy within and around you. When you feel a little bit sick about something you know you have to do, but don't want to, you might feel it in your body a bit, but there isn't an organ that we can measure that says \"this is the bit where dread lives\". But we feel dread within us, and just outside of our physical bodies - dread is a feeling that we often sense in the air directly in front of our stomach. The same is true of \"butterflies in our stomach\". We feel these not just within our stomachs, but we can feel it in the space and the air in front of our bodies. The same happens with joy. We can't measure it in our bodies, but we might feel light as a feather, a lightness within and around us. Our feelings - and our thoughts - exist but are not contained within any one body system. That is because they don't live there. They live in the vast amounts of space that I have described, the 99% that isn't physical matter. In other words, our thoughts, feelings and beliefs are part of the energy within and around us. This space - this energy - is known as the electromagnetic field, as is being studied by the [HeartMath Institute ](https://www.heartmath.org/)in the U.S. It has measured that the electromagnetic field extends to up to 20ft from the heart. The Principles of Homeopathy Homeopathy is an example of an energy medicine. In other words, rather than working with the 1% physical matter, which pharmaceutical drugs are designed to do, it works with the 99% energy that we made from. Homeopathy still impacts of course on our physical wellbeing (on the 1%), in the same way that pharmaceutical drugs affect our energy field (the 99%), however - unlike pharmaceutical drugs - it is a system of medicine that understands that we are made of energy, and so the medicines (remedies) takes into account how those remedies help the whole of us. Homeopathy was discovered by a German medical doctor, Dr Samuel Hahnemann, I am always impressed by how its development has been helped by influential medical doctors and pharmacists who found that conventional medicine wasn't working well enough. My favourite is the story of Dr Hering who, whilst a medical student, was tasked with disproving homeopathy. He set about his task with zeal, but found he was unable to do so, instead being completely convinced of its usefulness as a medicine and then practiced as a homeopathic doctor. He became hugely influential in the development of homeopathy. Around 400 GPs in the UK practice homeopathy, and there is a professional body to represent the many doctors, pharmacists, midwives, vets and other conventionally trained medical professionals who are trained homeopaths. There is plenty of scientific evidence to support its use, some of which I describe [here](https://www.danicaapolline.co.uk/scientific-evidence-for-homeopathy). But what is it and what does it do? A homeopathic medicine is a medicine that takes a substance and then dilutes it many many many times, so that there is no actual substance remaining in the medicine - just an energetic \"hint\", or imprint of it. It takes a substance, diluted many many many times so it is just an essence of that substance, and introduces it to the body (and energy field). The body is designed to know how to make itself well (that is the purpose of the immune system). Homeopathic remedies act as catalysts for the immune system, to help the body, mind and soul return to health. It's a bit like having \"hair of the dog\" - a teeny drink of alcohol, the day after a big night out, to cure a hangover. In conventional medicine, we fight diseases. We get into a battle, and do everything we can to squash any illness, with the might and power of pharmaceutical drugs if necessary. Diseases are definitely bad and to be defeated at all costs. In homeopathy and other natural medicines, diseases are an invitation to identify a weakness or imbalance in our health and/or lives, to strengthen our vital force and our immune system, and then to come to balance - and in the process this can strengthen the health of the whole person if they are ready to rebalance. In conventional medicine, the drugs are there to stop the disease, in plant medicine, the plants work together with the body to heal it, and in homeopathy, the medicines act as a catalyst to help the immune system know how to be strong again so it can heal the body and get rid of the disease itself. Another way in which homeopathy can work can be summarized as follows. Some substances that homeopathy uses would be toxic if ingested in full physical, material form. One homeopathic remedy for example, is belladonna, which is deadly nightshade. Deadly nightshade would make us very sick - very ill, and usually there is a fever involved - but the homeopathic version can be extremely useful for teething babies and with fevers. The homeopathic version doesn't contain any of the substance that could make us sick, but putting in that teeny tiny energetic imprint of the substance - the energetic hint of the fever it generates - tells the immune system what to do to bring the body back to health. Practical, Classical & Integrated Homeopathy Almost every form of medicine seeks to modernise itself, and become more accessible and more efficient. There are times when this isn't always helpful. For example, with classical acupuncture, part of the learning about which points to use involves feeling and intuition. I believe this to be an important aspect of medicine, that modern acupuncture doesn't develop, focusing on a knowledge-based approach only. I explain why feeling (and therefore a classical approach to acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine - TCM - is important) in [this blog post](https://www.danicaapolline.co.uk/blog/2018/8/4/pharmaceuticals-medicine-are-a-feminist-issue). I often feel we try to tamper with \"perfectly designed\" systems of medicine, and can lose their essence, and the core of how they can be most helpful when we try to change them. I would say it is different however when we look at how homeopathy has developed. In homeopathy, classical homeopathy is the homeopathy that was practised in the time of it's founder, Dr Samuel Hahnemann, where only one remedy (medicine) is given. This is still practised today, by practical and classical and integrated homeopaths. It applies the principle that, if you get the \"right\" remedy, then only one remedy is needed for the body to heal itself of that issue. I have seen this in action, with my son's colic - where he literally unfurled his body and stopped crying for the first time in 6 weeks, when I gave him one remedy, and in many many other cases. Classical homeopaths only prescribe in this way. Practical and integrated homeopaths take a different approach. They take the view that because we live in a modern world with many layers of issues that can affect us, more environmental pollution, unhealthy foods, genetic markers etc, sometimes we need to support different aspects of a person's health and wellbeing at the same time. And because of this, practical homeopaths can work with more than one remedy at a time, working with layers of what could be affecting us at the same time. Both practical and integrated homeopaths will work using the classical approach too, but they will use more than one remedy if they feel it is the best approach. I am a practical homeopath, and use this approach in my practice. \u00a9 Danica Apolline 2017, 2018 "}
