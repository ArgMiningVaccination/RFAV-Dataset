This table has toxicity ratings for 280+ gems, based on their composition and potential for bioactivity, as well as descriptions of the hazards they may pose. 10 Minute Read [Addison Rice](/author/arice/) Gemstone Toxicity During Normal Handling Most minerals are safe to handle normally. However, radioactivity in minerals containing uranium and thorium should be assessed using a Geiger counter prior to handling. Water soluble gems will also require extra care. While certain [heavy metals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metals) have adverse effects at any concentration, others are far less toxic. Gemstone Toxicity While Cutting Lapidaries should exercise caution when cutting potentially toxic minerals. Inhalation or accidental ingestion of particles could be detrimental to your health. Furthermore, inhalation of asbestos and silica can be physically toxic. For additional information, see our articles on [lapidary health hazards and safety tips](https://www.gemsociety.org/article/lapidary-health-hazards/) and [toxic and radioactive gem safety tips](https://www.gemsociety.org/article/toxic-and-radioactive-gems-safety-tips/). Potential Toxicity for Intentional Gemstone Ingestion Crystal healers should avoid making potions with toxic gems. They should also avoid putting these gems in their or their patients' mouths. In addition, some gems have no known toxicity but are still soluble in acids. If you swallow particles of these gems, their dissolution in your stomach could release impurities in the mineral. Certain gems may react dangerously with stomach acid to produce hydrofluoric acid (HF) or hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S). Avoid ingesting gems that may produce these dangerous substances. Finally, most lists of toxic gems on crystal healing websites include aluminum and a few other elements as toxic. While these can be toxic, the dose required to induce a toxic reaction is exceptionally high. As long as you're not eating rock dust, toxicity from these stones is unlikely. Gemstone Toxicity Table If you find any incorrect or inconsistent information in this table, please contact the IGS environmental engineer and Caltech graduate, Addison's interest in the mesmerizing and beautiful results of earth's geological processes began in her elementary school's environmental club. When she isn't writing about gems and minerals, Addison spends winters studying ancient climates in Iceland and summers hiking the Colorado Rockies.
