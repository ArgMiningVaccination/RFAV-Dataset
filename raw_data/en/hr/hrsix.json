In the United States, childhood immunization among children who are below 3 years of age continues to be below Healthy People 2020 targets for some vaccines such as DTaP, PCV, HIB, Hep A, Rotavirus, and Hep B birth dose. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between maternal characteristics and childhood immunization series completion rates among children 2 years of age. The social learning theory and self-efficacy theory provided the theoretical foundation for the study. Data from the Florida Department of Health Immunization Surveys were used. ANOVA and multinomial statistical tests were used to analyze the data. According to the study results, maternal factors such as age, marital status, and educational level were significant predictors of childhood immunization completion rates. The findings from the study could lead to positive social change initiatives through education and inclusion of mothers\u00c4\u00f4 concerns during interventions to increase immunization rates in children. Increase in immunization completion rates can reduce communicable disease in the population. Insights from this study could assist health care providers, parents, and care givers in their responsibilities relative to childhood immunization practices.

The overall objective of this multisite, multicountry (Brazil, Colombia, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Puerto Rico) observational cohort study, Zika in Infants and Pregnancy (ZIP study), is to assess the strength of the association between ZIKV during pregnancy and adverse health outcomes, and quantify the risk of vertical transmission. Across all sites, the ZIP Study aims to recruit 10,000 pregnant women over the age of 15 years in their first or early second trimester of pregnancy, follow them longitudinally throughout their pregnancy, and follow their infants until they reach 12 months of age. We aim to study the impact of incident ZIKV during pregnancy on maternal, fetal, and newborn health outcomes, including but not limited to microcephaly and other CNS malformations, ocular and auditory abnormalities, perinatal death, seizures, and arthrogryposis. Upon enrollment and during monthly clinic visits, a medical history, a targeted physical exam focused on pregnancy, a socioeconomic questionnaire, an environmental assessment, and tests for ZIKV and other arboviruses are conducted. Additionally, participants are surveyed for occupational and domestic characteristics, health risk factors, and chemical exposures. Upon delivery, consented newborns are enrolled and given a general physical exam, sensory and development assessments, and tested for ZIKV infection. This session presents an overview of the Zika epidemic, focusing on Central and South America, and describes the ZIP study methodologies and study progress. Epidemiology Planning of health education strategies, interventions, and programs Abstract Zika speak in a changing climate: Novel approaches by American Academy of Pediatrics to democratize health and prevent unintended consequences Perry E. Sheffield, MA, MPH3 (1)Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, (2)American Academy of Pediatrics, Itasca, IL, (3)American Academy of Pediatrics, Elk Grove Village, IL APHA 2017 Annual Meeting & Expo (Nov. 4 - Nov. 8) As the Zika virus pandemic began to spread rapidly in the Americas in 2015 and travel warnings were implemented, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) became involved in multiple ways. Two ways are the AAP involvement with the national Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units (PEHSU) network and Project ECHO\u00ae. PEHSUs are a system of specialists who respond to questions from public health professionals, clinicians, policy makers, and the public about the impacts of environmental factors on the health of children and reproductive-age adults. Project ECHO\u00ae is an established platform that provides health professional education and training, through a telementoring platform. This platform increases clinical expertise and democratizes medicine by increasing capacity for comprehensive care in geographically remote or under resourced areas. Through a combination of a peer-reviewed articles, factsheets, and health department consultations, the PEHSU helped balance the risk of chemical exposures from pesticides and repellents with the importance of protection from mosquitos and prevent unintended consequences. Since the AAP had implemented other Project ECHO telementoring clinics, they were well poised to respond quickly for needs that arose from Zika virus. Project ECHO\u00ae Zika launched in 2016 in Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands with the aim of increasing pediatric clinician knowledge, comfort, and competence in providing care to children and families affected by Zika virus. In an era of rapidly changing climate, established networks such as PEHSU and facile platforms such as Project ECHO\u00ae are critical to overcome existing and prevent worsening of health inequities. Administer health education strategies, interventions and programs Assessment of individual and community needs for health education Planning of health education strategies, interventions, and programs Provision of health care to the public Abstract Health workers readiness in immunization services provision in Ethiopia: A cross sectional study Filimona Bisrat, MD, MPH1 and Legesse Bezabih2 (1)Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, (2)CORE Group Polio Project, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia APHA 2017 Annual Meeting & Expo (Nov. 4 - Nov. 8) Background: Ethiopia has implemented immunization programs for the last four decades. However, the coverage in many parts of Ethiopia is less than the target level. Among obstacles to achieving the target include health workers\u00c4\u00f4 readiness for the provision of immunization. Objectives: Assess the health workers\u00c4\u00f4 readiness in immunization services provision in Ethiopia. Method: A cross sectional survey was conducted on a sample of 648 health workers involved in immunization service provision in 233 health centers from 10 zones in Ethiopia. Data was collected using self administered interview, entered into EpiData, and analyzed using STATA12. Result: Almost all health centers (99.2%) provide immunization services, From the sampled health centers, 98.9% provide birth dose, 97.6% infant vaccination and 96.6% tetanus vaccines for women. However, only 51.6% of EPI focal persons, 37.1% of delivery ward staff, and 42.6% of health center heads correctly knew the placement of child vaccines in a chest fridge and 62.3% answered correctly on free availability, safety, and effectiveness of vaccines, and on vaccine provision to children with mild illness. Conclusion and recommendation: All health centers were providing child immunization at birth or after and a larger portion of the staff were involved in immunization service provision. Staff showed higher levels of involvement and motivation, but levels of knowledge of vaccine placement and vaccine related issues remain low. Providing continuous, high quality on the job training should continue for those involved in immunization service provision at health centers. Provision of health care to the public "}
