While counsel - ing inter ventions have had some success in achieving these goals, clinical trials ar e testing a wide array of biomedical strate-gies to prevent HIV infection. Recognizingthat none of these approaches will be 100percent ef fective, widespr ead adoption of any of them will r equir e practitioners to address clients who may abandon their condoms and safer sex approaches in hopeof complete protection from a shot or a pill. This article briefly reviews three biomedi- cal strategies to pr event HIV : vaccines, HIV antiviral tr eatment (including both pr e- and post-exposure prophylaxis), and treatment of sexually transmitted infections. It goes onto outline some of the key challenges instudying and implementing these strategies. Preventive Vaccines Many experts believe that a preventive vaccine is the best hope for stemming theglobal HIV pandemic. To date, however,researchers have completed only two ef-cacy trials of candidate vaccines, neither of which r esulted in a vaccine that was able to prevent infection. The rst generation of HIV vaccines employed a strategy similar to the success - ful hepatitis B vaccine: they used syntheticcopies of the pr oteins on the outer envelope of HIV in hopes of stimulating the body' s production of antibodies specic to those proteins, antibodies that would then neutral - ize invading HIV befor e it enter ed host CD4+ cells. While antibodies pr oduced by this approach in VaxGen's efcacy trials failed to protect against HIV, improved understandingof the virus and how it evades antibody neutralization through its highly variableprotein coat has informed the next genera-tion of HIV vaccine candidates. Another signicant challenge in designing a vaccine involves HIV's capacity to establishitself in the host body's cellular memory. A vaccine should engage not only humoral immunity, that is, the production of anti-bodies, but also cellular immunity, that is, itshould train the body' s cytotoxic T -cells to detect and eradicate HIV -infected cells con- taining actively r eplicating virus. Because HIV can remain latent in cells for years, cytotoxicT-cells may overlook these \"silently infected\"cells. Thus, researchers do not expect vac-cine-induced cellular r esponses, by them - selves, to eliminate HIV infection. CytotoxicT-cell-based vaccines may, however, reduceHIV production, which could potentiallydelay the progression of HIV in that personand reduce his or her infectiousness. A signi cant pipeline of new vaccine candidates will enter phase I trials in 2004, although it will require at least seven years of clinical testing befor e one of them could be licensed for use. It is also unlikely thatthe rst vaccine released would providecomplete pr otection fr om either infection or disease progression. Recognizing this likelihood, studies employing mathemati- cal modeling suggest that a community'sadoption of a partially effective vaccinecould, in fact, worsen an epidemic if indi-viduals substantially increase their risk behaviors in response to the faulty belief that a vaccine is 100 percent effective. 1 Recent studies have assessed this potential \"behavioral disinhibition\" amongvaccine trial volunteers. The North Ameri-can/Eur opean V axGen study randomized participants either to a vaccine plus risk reduction counseling group or a placebo shot plus risk r eduction counseling gr oup. It found, for both gr oups, that the pr eva- lence of unpr otected sexual practices ini- tially declined but rose back to baseline risk levels after 36 months of follow-up. 2A Shot or a Pill: Exploring Biomedical Approaches to HIV Prevention Jonathan Fuchs, MD, MPH, and Grant Colfax, MD April 2004 v19 n4FOCUS2 April 2004Without having a comparison group, how- ever, that under went the same risk r educ- tion counseling as the original trial par tici- pants but who did not receive any shots, it is dif cult to know if shot r ecipients are altering their risk-taking behavior because they believe that the injections are protect-ing them fr om HIV . To explore this possibil- ity, the Centers for Disease Control and Pre- vention (CDC) funded six VaxGen trial sites to enroll a matched control group of volun-teers into a second study, called VISION. A preliminary analysis of VISION found that among men who have sex with men, contr ol par ticipants\u2014those who r eceived counseling only\u2014reported a more marked decline than both groups of original trial par-ticipants in the number of r eported sexual partners and level of unprotected anal sex. 3 One explanation for this nding is that the original trial par ticipants wer e less r espon - sive to ongoing risk reduction counseling than the contr ol group, perhaps because they assumed that they wer e protected by the shot. This might have occur red despite informed consent processes emphasizing the unknown efcacy of the product being testedand the possibility that a subject might be randomized into the placebo gr oup. These ndings suggest that innovative risk r educ- tion counseling strategies and community education ar e needed to addr ess behavioral disinhibition both during the vaccine trials and after an approved vaccine is available. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is the use of a limited course of a combination of twoor three HIV antiviral drugs to prevent HIVinfection immediately after a presumedexposure. The plausibility of PEP in prevent- ing HIV infection is based on data fr om occu - pational exposures among health care work- ers, mother-to-child transmission studies,and animal studies, but ther e are no studies that actually prove its efcacy. 4The validity of a widely cited study suggesting that PEPdecreased the risk of infection among health care workers was limited by its design. 5 In addition to the lack of ef cacy data, concer ns about using PEP for sexual expo - sures include: potential drug side effects, adherence challenges, and potential behav- ioral disinhibition due to the availability ofReferences 1.

Presentation atAIDS Vaccine 2003,New York, N.Y.,September 2003.For decades, the words \"AIDS vaccine\" have deliv- ered the most potent dose of hopeavailable to people working with HIV. So powerful have they been that they overshadow the magic of the words \"chronic, manageable condition,\" which became a popu-lar mantra in the early days of triple combination treatment. The idea that a shot might pro- tect someone is not far-fetched interms of infections like polio ormeasles. But despite predictionsevery few years that we'll have avaccine in two, then ve, then ten years, more than 20 years have elapsed. We have something toshow for it\u2014a payoff in terms ofunderstanding the vir us far better than we did\u2014but nothing that canbe put in a syringe to save lives. At the same time, researchers have achieved some success inimplementing other \"biomedical\"approaches to HIV pr evention. AsJonathan Fuchs and Grant Colfax discuss in this issue of FOCUS, \"PEP,\" \"PREP,\" and STD treatment alloffer the possibility of preventing infection or transmission throughthe use of medications. Their arti- cle outlines the state of the science and the signicant challenges toimplementing each of these approaches. Also in this issue Leslie Wolf and Bernard Lo discussthe role of informed consent toensure that people understand therisks and benets of participatingin research on biomedicalapproaches. Fuchs and Colfax introduce the factor that is both the impetus forresearch in this area and what mayturn out to be the gr eatest thr eat to its success: human behavior . Biomedical inter ventions are attractive because ideally, getting ashot or taking a pill would offerprotection without requiring anybehavioral change.However, because of HIV's supreme ability to adapt in response either to a vaccine or to aprotective treatment, it appearsthat biomedical interventions are not likely to be 100 percent or even 75 percent effective. At the same time, as Fuchs and Colfax report,some r esearch suggests that it is difcult for many of us to compre-hend on an emotional as well as an intellectual level that behavioral precautions are necessary even ifyou get a shot. People may inadver-tently place themselves at greaterrisk after they get a vaccine or pre-exposure prophylaxis than whenthey were relying on condoms orneedle cleaning or their wits. None of this means that biomedical interventions are bad: the promise of a cheap, effective vaccine or treatment ismonumental. But we must con-tinue to impr ove and dissemi - nate behavioral as well biomedi - cal appr oaches, and we must supplement biomedical interven-tions with signicant educationto ensure true protection, notjust a false sense of security . Editorial: Protection versus Presumption Robert Marks, EditorFOCUS3 April 2004PEP. Despite these caveats, PEP is beingoffered in a number ofU.S. cities to people whoexperience \"high-risk exposures,\" including unprotected anal or vagi- nal sex with a partnerwho is known to be HIV - positive. With a fewnotable exceptions, stud- ies evaluating PEP for non-occupational expo-sures have thatdrug combinations havenot resulted in severeadverse effects; have ledto adherence rates of 75percent to 85 percent forfour-week regimens; and when administered with substantial risk reduction counseling, have led to declines in risk behavior. 4In terms of efcacy, sev- eral individuals have become infected withHIV after r eceiving PEP r egimens, but it is not clear whether ser oconversion was due to PEP failur e, past sexual exposure prior to PEP, or re-exposure following PEP. The greatest challenge to PEP arises from the need to take it shortly after an isolated,high-risk exposur e. Data suggest, though, that a substantial pr oportion of men who have sex with men, particularly those at highest risk for acquiring HIV, repeatedlyengage with multiple partners in practicesthat may result in transmission. 6There- fore, inter ventions tar geting these rant fur ther exploration. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Both the problems and potential of PEP have recently inspired testing a newapproach: pr e-exposur e prophylaxis (PREP). PREP is the sustained use of HIV antiviral drugs or \"chemoprophylaxis\" to prevent HIV infection in the face of ongoing exposure. All currently planned PREP studies \u2014ef- cacy studies in Cambodia and Africa and asafety study in San Francisco and Atlanta \u2014 use tenofovir as their PREP agent. T enofovir is a potent, relatively safe and well-toler- ated HIV antiviral agent that can be admin-istered as a single daily oral dose. It is par - ticularly attractive for PREP applications, because compar ed with other HIV medica - tions, tenofovir infr equently leads to HIV resistance, and its \"side effect prole\" is similar to placebo in double-blind trials. 7 Despite these pr omising factors, substan - tial challenges r emain. Strategies that have acceptable risk-benet ratios for treatment of an infection may be unacceptable for pre-vention of infection, particularly in healthy, HIV-negative individuals. There are four notable challenges in studying whetherPREP is even safe, much less efcacious.First, rare but serious adverse events may be associated with chronic tenofovir ther- apy, including metabolic complications, and renal and bone toxicities. 7Second, although tenofovir r esistance may develop less rapidly compared to other HIV antiviralagents, if a person on PREP becomes in- fected\u2014that is, if PREP does not prevent infection after exposure\u2014he or she mayhave taken tenofovir monotherapy for a period of weeks or months prior to diagno- sis of that infection. Such sustained mono-therapy could lead to a tenofovir-resistantform of HIV, which may affect future treat-ment options for that individual. Third, adherence to even once-daily PREP may prove challenging to individuals at highest risk for sexual exposure. Finally, even if PREP is shown to be effective at pre-venting infection, it is not known whetherpeople will incr ease their risk behaviors without using any other pr otection, for example, condoms. As discussed above inthe context of partially effective vaccines,such behavioral disinhibition may negateany protective effects PREP may have onreducing HIV transmission risks. HIV Treatment to Prevent Further Transmission There is increasing interest in treating HIV-positive individuals to reduce the risk oftransmitting HIV to HIV-negative partners.The logic of this appr oach is suppor ted by data demonstrating that among untr eated populations, as viral load decreases, the odds of transmitting to par tners decr eases. 8 Most notably, in a Ugandan heterosexual cohort, there were no cases of HIV transmis-sion fr om people with HIV who, without treatment, had viral loads of less than 1,500. It remains unknown whether the same corre- lations between viral load and transmissionrisk hold among treated populations, that is,people receiving HIV antiviral therapy.Among untreated populations, factors that contribute to maintaining low viral loads, including a person's immune responses andthe \"viral tness\" of the HIV in his or herbody, may also contribute to lower transmis - sion risk in ways that may not translate to lower rates of transmission among peoplewho have successfully suppr essed HIV through treatment. Currently, the HIV Pre- vention T rial Network (HPTN) is planning an international randomized contr olled trial to evaluate the ef fectiveness of HIV antiviral therapy to prevent sexual transmission among mixed-serostatus couples.

FOCUS4 April 2004will compare two treatment strategies: early HIV antiviral tr eatment upon enroll- ment plus HIV primary care; or HIV primarycare, without the initiation of HIV treatmentuntil clinically indicated for the health of the individual. In its pilot phase, the study will determine whether it is both acceptable and feasible for HIV-positive individuals totake HIV tr eatment not primarily to address their own health needs, but to reduce theirpartner's risk of infection. Treating Sexually Transmitted Infections Numerous observational studies have shown that bacterial sexually transmittedinfections (STIs) such as syphilis and gonor-rhea can been community-based trials\u2014one in Tanzaniaand two Uganda\u2014to test whether symp-tomatic treatment or periodic mass treat- ment for bacterial STIs can reduce HIV rates in a community. The Tanzanian trial, whichutilized symptomatic treatment, found a 40percent decr ease in HIV incidence; the latter two failed to show an impact. These confl ict- ing results have been ascribed to differences in population demographics, risk behaviors,prevalence of bacterial STIs, the relativematurity of the HIV epidemics in those com-munities, or any combination of these. 9 Since viral, although not bacterial, STIs are being recognized as the most commoncause of genital ulcer disease worldwide,greater attention has been drawn herpes, causedby herpes simplex vir A r ecent meta-analysis r e- ported that the risk of acquiring HIV was doubled in those with prior HSV -2 in- fection. 10This observation is biologically plausible: HSV-2 can create micro-ulcera-tions in the genital tract that act as por tals for HIV entry. In addition, since these ulcer- ations are caused by infection, activated lymphocytes migrate to them, and these arethe very cells HIV targets for infection. Con-sidering the prevalence of HSV-2 and theseassociations with HIV transmission, the number of new HIV infections attributableto HSV-2 is likely to be substantial. With the availability of safe, effective, and inexpensive HSV-2 suppressive therapy, two large, international, randomized placebo con- trolled trials will look at whether daily acy- clovir can reduce HIV incidence. The rststudy is evaluating whether tr eating HIV-neg- ative, HSV-2-positive men and women withacyclovir will decrease HIV acquisition rates. The second study will evaluate whether HSV- 2 suppressive therapy in herpes-infected,HIV-positive individuals will reduce thechance of transmitting HIV to their partners. Again, all participants in both HIV pre- vention studies will receive state of the artHIV risk reduction counseling and con-doms. They will also receive acyclovir forHSV-2 outbreaks. If shown effective in pre-venting HIV, acyclovir taken twice daily at less than $75.00 a year will create an affordable HIV prevention option. Its broaduse in places such as sub-Saharan Africawher e HSV -2 may account for up to 45 per - cent of new HIV infections could have a signi cant impact on the global pandemic. Conclusion To prevent behavioral disinhibition during the clinical testing and potential deploymentof these biomedical appr oaches, the pr even- tion community must be steadfast in offer- ing innovative risk reduction counseling andpromoting male condom use. Even thoughmounting observational data suggest thatHIV antiviral tr eatment and some sexually transmitted infection tr eatments may be helpful in preventing HIV transmission, they should not be used until pr oven safe and effective in well-designed randomized-con-trolled trials. Finally, policymakers, workingclosely with communities and scientists,must identify mechanisms to nance the manufacturing, purchase, and distribution of these potentially costly biomedicaloptions to ensure that available technologiesare also accessible to people at highest risk.

Informed consent is a pro- cess\u2014not just a signed form\u2014thatseeks to ensur e that a research participant's choice to participateis voluntary and based on an understanding of the potential risks and benets of a researchproject, the project's purpose, and alternatives to participation. Informed consent requires that a research participant be a com-petent adult, that researchersdisclose all information pertinentto the decision to participate, andthat consent is free from coer- cion or undue influence. 1HIV biomedical treatment and pre-vention research presents specialchallenges to this pr ocess, be - cause par ticipants may have multiple vulnerabilities, peoplewith mental illness may not becapable of giving informed con-sent, research may be considereda bene t, and r par ticipa - tion may pr esent psychosocial harms. In addition, study personnel need to remind potential participants that re-search is not the same as health or behav-ioral health care and need to help ensurethat all par ticipants have access to appr opri- ate car e independent of the r esear ch setting. Decision-Making Capacity Vulnerable participants . Some research participants may be considered vulnerablebecause of personal characteristics or cir - cumstances that may affect their ability to freely consent. 2For example, a person who is contacted shortly after learning of his orher HIV infection may nd it difcult in themidst of shock, fear, or other emotionalresponses to weigh the risks and benets of enr olling in an early treatment study. Men who have sex with men, injection drugusers, people of color, and women, who, forvarious reasons, may be at higher risk of HIV infection, are more likely to be socially and economically vulnerable because of historical attitudes and discrimination. Investigators conducting HIV -related research must, therefore, pay attention tovulnerabilities of potential participants and how these vulnerabilities might affect the consent process. For example, investigatorsworking in immigrant communities should consider consulting with community mem- bers to develop a consent process that isculturally appropriate. Incapacitated participants . People who lack decision-making capacity cannot con-sent to research participation. Since mentalillness and substance use may compromise this capacity, researchers must evaluate par- ticipants' capacities to make informed deci-sions. One method of testing both capacityand compr ehension is for investigators to ask par ticipants to explain in their own wor ds what will happen if they par ticipate in the study, in terms of the study procedures andbenets and risks. For example, in a vaccinetrial, participants should be able to explainthat they will r eceive vaccine or placebo, the choice will be made randomly\u2014not by studypersonnel\u2014and that they should continue touse prevention measures to protect them-selves from HIV infection. It is ethically problematic to conduct resear ch with people who cannot give in - formed consent if the r esear ch could other- wise be conducted with competent persons. However , it may be ethically per missible to enroll people who lack decision-making capacity\u2014with a surrogate's consent\u2014forresear ch on cognitive impair ment, for exam- ple, HIV-related dementia, or serious dis- eases affecting the participants. It is impor- tant to note that a person should not bejudged as lacking capacity because he or she makes what researchers view as \"bad\"References Univer-sity Press, 1994. 2.

See also references cited in articles in this issue.A person does not lack capacity to give consent simply because he or she makes what researchers view as \"bad\" decisions.FOCUS6 April 2004decisions. For example, surrogate consent could not be used to enr oll a person who persistently engages in activities that placehim or her at risk of HIV infection in trials ofpost-exposure or pre-exposure prophylaxis. 3 Disclosure of Risks Psychosocial risks . Psychosocial risks may be pr ominent in HIV research, because HIV research often collects detailed infor-mation about participants' sexual behaviors and use of legal and illegal drugs\u2014all of which may be stigmatized by society anddisclosure of which may lead to physicalharm, discrimination, or legal action.Researchers need to discuss these riskscarefully during the consent process. Forexample, HIV-positive participants who dis-close to researchers that they have hadunprotected sexual intercourse with HIV-negative partners may be at risk of criminal or civil liability in some states for know- ingly exposing others to HIV if the researchrecords were disclosed. 4Potential partici- pants need to know what steps r esear chers are taking to keep r ecords condential and thereby reduce this risk. Researchers should also address the ways in which trial participation may lead toalienation from family or friends. For exam-ple, if a par ticipant tells friends or family about the study , listeners may conclude that the participant is HIV-positive or is engagingin specic stigmatized activities, even whenhe or she is not. Further, participants invaccine trials may test HIV-positive even iftheir ser oconversion r epresents only that the person has r eceived the trial vaccine and is not actually HIV-infected. This may lead to limits on inter national travel and on eligibil - ity for certain governmental jobs, for exam- ple, in the U.S. Peace Corps, foreign service,and militar y. 5 Psychosocial risks may not be as appar- ent as physical risks. Therefore, researchers must take special care to ensure that poten-tial participants appreciate these risks andunderstand the steps that researchers willtake to minimize these risks. For example, investigators should also tell par ticipants who on the team will have access to the data that is collected, whether the data willbe coded to obscur e identity , and what other steps\u2014for example, obtaining a fed- eral Cer ticate of r esear ch data fr om subpoena\u2014 researchers will take to protect participant con dentiality . Assumption of ef cacy. A serious concer n for investigators r esearching biomedical prevention interventions such as vaccines, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and theexperimental pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is that trial par ticipation may actu- ally result in an increase in risky behaviors.In these situations, participants may mis-takenly believe or may want to believe that the study intervention is 100 percent effec- tive and will protect them from infection. 6 Researchers must clearly address these con- cerns during the consent process by empha- sizing that the intervention may not beeffective and that participants need to avoid behaviors that may expose them to HIV. This information should be highlightedin the consent document, even using bold print or all capitals letters, and raised with participants throughout the study. Therapeutic misconception. Research differs from clinical care in that its goal isto test a hypothesis and develop general-izable knowledge in order to benet soci-ety in the long-term and not necessarily to benet individuals in the short-term. 7 Moreover, innovative drugs offered in clinical trials often are shown to be inef-fective. Many r esear ch par ticipants do not understand this distinction. Early in the antiviral era, HIV advocates wer e among the rst to view research as a benet\u2014asaccess to better care\u2014and demanded rightof entry to it. However, researchers needto help par ticipants understand that while they may hope that clinical trial par ticipa - tion will provide them direct clinical bene- ts, the research is being conductedbecause no one knows whether the experi-mental intervention is safe and effectivecompar ed to the contr ol inter vention. Conclusions The special characteristics of HIV , HIV research, and the populations most affectedby the epidemic create special challenges toinfor med consent. Investigators should pay particular attention to these issues when conducting HIV research, which must ulti- mately protect participants as well as fur-ther HIV-related prevention and care. 3.

Willingness to volunteer in future preventive HIV vaccine trials: Issuesand perspectives from three U.S. communities. Journal of Acquired Immune Deciency Syndrome. 2001; 26(1): 63-71. (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill; and University of California, San Francisco.) A three-city study that was able to sur- vey three different subpopulations foundthat almost half of research subjectswould willingly participate in a hypotheti-cal future HIV vaccine trial. Researchers recruited 87 participants, ranging from20 years old to 72 yearsold for this qualitativestudy. The study targeted gay and bisexual men in San Francisco, injectiondrug users in Philadelphia,and African Americans inDurham, Nor th Carolina. Participants lled out sociodemographic ques-tionnaires and engaged insemi-structured, open-ended inter views. In or der to reveal the br eadth of possible responses, inter- viewers used a techniquecalled \"freelisting\" toencourage participants to brainstorm all pos-sible esponse to speci c ques - tions. Inter viewers asked four questions: would a participant volunteer for a vaccine trial; what par ticipants per ceived as potential benets of volunteering; what participants perceived as the risks of volunteering; andwhat infor mation par ticipants would want to have about the trial prior to volunteering. Forty-six percent of all participants said they would volunteer for a vaccine trial,41 percent said they would not volunteer,and 12 percent were unsure and said theyneeded more information before making a decision. Ther e wer e no statistically sig - nicant differences among participants from all three populations in terms ofwillingness to volunteer . Seven themes emerged among the per- ceived bene ts cited by par ticipants. The three most common themes wer e \"altr u- ism,\" \"a desire to help stop the spread of AIDS,\" and \"self-bene t,\" a categor y that included both nancial or practical com - pensation and potential impr ovement in health. Other benets included increased social networks, minimal side effects, thedevelopment of an effective vaccine, and reduced economic costs. The most commonly cited risk focused on the negative side effects of the trial vac-cine, including reactions that may result but are unknown at the time of recruit- ment. Participants, particularly those in San Francisco, were also concerned aboutthe social consequences of volunteering, for example, stigmatization. Other risks included contracting the virus from the vaccine, having an unpleasant experience, testing HIV-positive, experiencing inconve-niences or limitations to daily life, and risk-ing the chance that the vaccine would notbe effective. Participants, again particularly in San Francisco,also stated thatoverly optimisticperceptions of thevaccine's effective- ness might lead to an increase in high-risk behavior. Most subjects (72 percent) stated that prior to volunteer - ing, the informationthey would mostwant to know wouldbe about the poten - side ef fects of the trial vaccine.Other desired infor-mation related to methodology, trust and condentiality,incentives, assistance with potential com - plications, ef fectiveness of the vaccine, future availability of the vaccine, and risk of contracting HIV . Notably, participants in San Francisco had more responses to each question,which may be r elated to gr eater exposur e to HIV education through local media. Nevirapine as Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Jackson JB, Barnett S, Piwowar-Manning E, et al. phase I/II study of nevirapine for pre-exposure prophylaxis ofHIV-1 transmission in uninfected subjects at high risk. AIDS. 2003; 17(4): 547-553. (Johns Hopkins University .) A small exploratory phase I/II trial found that low-dose nevirapine may be worthy offurther study as HIV pr e-exposur e prophy - laxis. Taken at any of three tested dosing increments, the HIV antiviral dr ug was well tolerated, r esulted in minimal or no blood or liver toxicity, and achieved target nevi- rapine levels in most subjects. Resear chers r ecruited 33 men and wo- men over the age of 18, selecting subjects who engage in behaviors that put them athigh risk for HIV. Of the 33 subjects, 10Recent Reports Half of subjects in a three-city, three- populatin study said they would willingly participate in a hypothetical future HIVvaccine trial.FOCUS8 April 2004engaged in non-monogamous unprotected sex, eight had HIV -infected sex partners, eight were men who have sex with men, andseven injected drugs, had sex with injectiondrug users, or both. Researchers divided subjects into three groups: 12 subjects were in Cohort A, which had a weekly regimen of nevirapine; 12 sub-jects wer e in Cohort B, which had a twice- weekly regimen; and nine subjects were inCohort C, which took the pills every other day. Each dosage was 200 milligrams, and the duration of the study was 12 weeks. Subjects reported a total of 30 adverse events during the study. Of these, 25 wereranked as mild and ve were consideredmoderate. None was described as severe. The most common adverse events were respiratory problems, nausea, and head-aches. The Centers for Disease Control andPrevention has not included nevirapine on the expanded list of antiviral drugs recom- mended for post-exposure prophylaxis rashes. , study par tici- pants did not r eport these conditions, pos- sibly due to the signi cantly lower dosages of nevirapine used in this study, the smallnumber of subjects, or the careful selectioncriteria for participation. One subject didexperience a rash, but he or she hadeczema befor e and during this study . Nine participants dropped out of the study, seven of whom ceased contact withresearchers following their departure. Thepercentage of subjects who dropped outof the study incr eased with incr easing dose. This could suggest a possible toxic - ity problem. However, the higher dose frequencies may have ser ved as a deter- rent to continued participation based on greater daily commitments to the study. Participant Attitudes in Thai Vaccine Studies Maek-A-Nantawat W , Pitisuttithum P , Phonrat B, et al. Evaluation of attitude, risk behavior and expectations among Thai participants in phase I/II HIV/AIDS vaccine trials. Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand. 2003; 86(4): 299-307. (Mahidol University, Bangkok.) A Thai study found that par ticipants in an HIV vaccine trial responded positively to the incorporation of participant education, riskreduction counseling, and veri cation of participant comprehension of trial proce- dures into the r ecruitment and trial pr ocess. The study also r esulted in decr eases in high- risk sexual behavior among participants. Resear chers conducted this study as par t of two Phase I/II vaccine trials. The rst took place in 1997-1998, and the second tookplace in 2000-2001. Researchers conducted educational sessions, performed risk reduc-tion counseling at each visit, and adminis- tered questionnaires on behaviors, knowl- edge, attitudes, expectations, and socialinfluences at the beginning of the study,after four months, and after 12 months. In the rst questionnaire, 62 percent of subjects reported being sexually active, 42 percent of whom had had sex withcommer cial sex workers. After participa- tion in the study for one year, only 35 per-cent reported being sexually active, only 1 percent of whom had sex, which was pro- tected, with a commercial sex worker. None of the subjects experienced rejection from friends or lovers due to their studyparticipation. One subject in the 1997 study,however, did have an application for insur-ance rejected by an insurance company. One year after the beginning of each study, 61 percent of participants in theearlier study and 85 percent of partici- pants in the later one reported having positive attitudes toward their involve-ment in the studies. The remainder ineach study expr essed neutral feelings. After four months, 98 per cent and 100 per - cent, r espectively, reported experiencing ben- ets from their participation, and after oneyear both these gures rose to 100 percent.Benets included periodic medical check-ups,education, and a sense of social contribution.Finally , after one year , 93 per cent and 98 percent, respectively, reported that they would consider volunteering in a future trial, demonstrating high satisfaction rates. Next Issue Professional counseling makes little room for unveriable phenomena suchas religious or spiritual belief. The r esult is that many highly competent profes- sionals are ill-equipped to accommodate religious language, spiritual exploration,and the host of issues at the intersectionof religion and society. In the May issueof FOCUS, Robert Hopcke, MFT, a ther- apist in private practice in Berkeley , Cal- ifornia and the former Coordinator of the AIDS Prevention Program for OperationConcer n in San Francisco, examines the role of spiritual development and thestages of faith in HIV -related counseling. Also in the May issue, Martin Milton, PsychD, Course Director of Psychother- apeutic and Counselling Psychology at the University of Sur rey in the United King- dom, describes existential-phenomeno - logical therapy and its application to HIV.
