An all-natural approach to health that deals with the root-cause. Ayur (meaning \"life\") veda (meaning \"science) translates to the science of life. It is thought to be the longest continuously practiced system of health on the planet, with roots in ancient India. With the belief that all medicines can be found in nature, Ayurveda functions with the knowledge that the human body is also inseparable from it. Filling in many of the gaps of modern medicine, Ayurveda can be used together with, or separate from, allopathic approaches. I integrate a combination of the following to create customized protocols for each of my clients. Health Counseling Say goodbye to 7 minute office visits. Your health is the prerequisite to the rest of your life, and deserves thorough time and attention. I conduct an in-depth Ayurvedic assessment that seeks to understand the complexity and causative factors of your condition. I specialize in helping people make the needed changes, mentally and physically, to truly heal and thrive through on-going counseling that address key factors like diet, lifestyle, and mind-body practices. Herbal Remedies Ayurveda utilizes time-tested and highly sophisticated botanical and herbo-mineral formulations to support your body's processes. Using both traditional formulations and custom crafted \"teas,\" I source herbs from the highest quality manufacturers. Herbal remedies come in various forms - teas, tablets, herbal oils and delicious herbal jams. They support the body to detoxify and rejuvenate, as well as target specific tissues and organ systems. Self-Care and Education With so much contradicting health and diet information out there, understanding your own system is fundamental. My goal is to help you get to a place where your diet and lifestyle sustain your health without the need for external remedies or regular visits. Your will learn about your body's physiology, the mind-gut connection, how to use food as medicine, your stress-response, and other self-care practices that will empower and radically change your life. Body Therapies Ayurveda's body therapies are one-of-a-kind. Uniquely suited to the individual, I offer 13 different traditional therapies including Abhyanga (warm herbal oil massage), Swedena (herbal steam bath), Pinda Swedena (massage using hot herbal poultices), and Marma Therapy (massage using vital points called marma points). I offer individual therapies, therapy packages and extended 3-14 day personal retreats. Ayurveda's body therapies are some of the most relaxing and rejuvenating practices in the world.
