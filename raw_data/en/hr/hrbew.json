Vaccination protects your child from developing a severe infection if he/she does get infected. Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for children? Only COVID-19 vaccines that are assessed to be safe and efficacious are authorised by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) for use in Singapore. Accordingly, the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination has recommended the (i) Moderna/Spikevax and Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine for persons aged 6 months to 4 years, (ii) Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine for persons aged 5 years to 11 years and, (iii) Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccine for persons aged 12 years to 17 years. The common side effects (such as injection site pain, fatigue, headache) of the vaccines are generally mild to moderate and resolve within a few days. Serious adverse events, such as severe allergic reactions and inflammation of the heart or its lining, are very rare. The doses of the vaccines for children are reduced compared to adolescents and adults. How many doses of vaccines are recommended for children? Children aged 6 months to 4 years - 2 doses of Moderna/Spikevax vaccine, OR 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine. The recommended intervals between the doses are eight weeks. Children aged 5 years to 17 years require 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Novavax/Nuvaxovid vaccines, as applicable, to confer Minimum Protection. The recommended interval between the first and second dose is eight weeks, while the recommended interval between the second and third dose is five months. This first and second dose were previously referred to as 'primary vaccination', and the third dose is also known as the booster dose. Children who were aged below 5 years and had completed their vaccination, should receive a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine after they turn 5. This third dose should be at least five months from their last vaccine dose. How to get your child vaccinated All children aged 6 months and above may walk in with their parent/guardian to any of the Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) or selected polyclinics that offers the vaccine recommended for the different age groups. Children aged 12 years and above who wish to receive the Novavax/Nuvavovid vaccine may do so at any of the 19 participating Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) offering the vaccine. Parents/guardians may book an appointment at a JTVC or PHPC for your child/ward to receive his/her vaccination using this [link](https://book.health.gov.sg/covid). If your child/ward has already received his/her first vaccination dose, or if your child has had a prior COVID-19 infection, please take note of the minimum intervals required before the next vaccination should be received.
