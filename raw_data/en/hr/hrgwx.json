The first determinant for implementing CBE is a curriculum which is aligned to defined learning outcomes and that clearly states the indicators to be achieved. The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has collaborated with Azim Premji University, Bengaluru, to develop the Learning Framework for Science, Mathematics, Social Science, English and Hindi for classes 9 and 10. The Learning Frameworks comprise explicitly stated knowledge, skills and dispositions that an education system should try to achieve. These frameworks would help develop a common shared understanding among teachers, students and other stakeholders and would serve as a common benchmark for teaching, learning and assessment across the country. These frameworks present indicators that are aligned to the CBSE curriculum and the NCERT Learning Outcomes. They further outline samples of pedagogical processes and assessment strategies to encourage curiosity, objectivity, creativity with a view to nurture scientific temper. This framework would be a key resource for the teacher as he/ she transacts the curriculum. They have been developed to ensure that the teacher aligns the teaching learning to meet the set quality standards and also use it to track learning levels of students. The effort has been to synchronize focus on quality education with uniformity in quality of standards across CBSE schools. We hope, these frameworks would not only become a reference point for competency-based education across the country but also facilitate planning and design of teaching-learning processes and assessment strategies by teachers and other stakeholders Team CBSEPreface The shift towards competency-based teaching and learning in the National Education Policy 2020 will be an important basis for curricular and pedagogical transformation in schools. The learning goals defined by the Policy, namely holistic and integrated development of students, and the acquisition of higher order cognitive capacities such as analysis, critical thinking and problem solving will be enabled by this shift. Such indicators will also enable equitable educational experiences through ensuring equivalence of pedagogical approaches and learning outcomes across schools and Boards of Examination. In keeping with the thrust on indicator based teaching-learning proposed in the National Education Policy, 2020, Azim Premji University has supported the Central Board of Secondary Education to develop a 'Learning Framework'. The learning framework is a comprehensive package which provides learning outcomes, indicators, assessment frameworks, samples of pedagogical processes, tools and techniques for formative assessment, blueprint, assessment items and rubrics. Five such frameworks have been developed for English, Hindi, Science, Social Science and Mathematics at the secondary stage. This document details the Learning Framework for Science. Learning Science involves various interconnected steps: observation, looking for regularities and patterns, making hypotheses, devising qualitative or mathematical models, deducing their consequences, verification of theories through observations and controlled experiments and thus arriving at the principles, theories and laws governing the physical world. The National Education Policy 2020 emphasizes \"Evidence-based reasoning and the scientific method will be incorporated throughout the school curriculum .... in order to encourage rational, analytical, logical, and quantitative thinking in all aspects of the curriculum.\" As per the Position Paper of the National Focus Group on Teaching of Science (2005), at the secondary stage, the students should be engaged in learning Science as a composite discipline, in working with hands and tools to design advanced technological modules, analysis on issues of surrounding environment and health and systematic experimentation to verify theoretical principles. Science education at this stage should enable students to develop a historical and developmental perspective and to enable students to view Science as a social enterprise. This document presents outcomes and indicators that focus on these Science specific skills that students need to attain through different concepts addressed in the syllabus. In addition to this, sample pedagogical processes, formative assessment strategies and summative assessment items are also provided to enable teachers to derive principles for making the alignment between learning outcomes-pedagogy and assessment in their classrooms.

Introduction Development of quality standards is paramount for any education board, to understand and track the learning level of students in the country. These standards comprise explicitly stated knowledge, skills, and dispositions that the education system should strive to achieve. The quality standards are expected to serve as common benchmarks for teaching, learning and assessment. It is hoped that this framework would enable teachers, schools, and other boards to design teaching-learning processes and develop assessment tools. The Learning Framework is a comprehensive package which delineates indicators, assessment frameworks, samples of pedagogical processes, tools & techniques for formative assessment purpose, blueprint, and assessment items and rubrics. 2. Process of Developing the Learning Framework Document An academically rigorous process has been undertaken to develop this document for various subjects, namely, English, Hindi, Social Sciences, Science and Mathematics. The flow diagram below depicts the steps in the process of developing the Learning Framework. Describe nature of subject Design sample pedagogical processes and assessment strategies Develop question paper design Indicate the NCERT curricular expectations and learning outcomes Create indicators for every learning outcome Design sample select response and constructed response assessment itemsIdentify subject specific content domains as per CBSE syllabus Define subject specific cognitive levels Develop marking scheme6 2.1 Describe Nature of Subject The school curriculum as per National Curriculum Framework 2005, is a broad plan for facilitating certain capabilities in learners which are guided by the larger aims of school education. These aims of school education are an inter-play of various variables - philosophical, psychological, existing socio-cultural context and the needs of the society, the nature of learning and many more informed by research. etc. Various school subjects enable in pursuing these aims through their distinct disciplinary focus and methods. This section clearly states the processes followed for constructing knowledge in a subject, and the tools and methods of enquiry used in each subject. Further, the relevance of engaging with the given subject in school education is highlighted. The research affirms that an in-depth understanding of the nature of subject would enable a teacher to design quality pedagogy and assessment in alignment to the subject specific skills. 2.2 Indicate the NCERT Curricular Expectations and Learning Outcomes The broad aims of school education stated in NEP 2020 are to- Develop good human beings capable of rational thought and action, possessing compassion and empathy, courage and resilience, a scientific temper and creative imagination, with sound ethical moorings and values Build character, and enable learners to be ethical, rational, compassionate and caring Achieve full human potential - through developing all aspects and capabilities of learners Develop the creative potential of each individual Enable learners to learn to think critically and solve problems, and use a multidisciplinary perspective Enable learners to innovate, adapt and absorb new material in novel and changing fields Enable children to not only learn, but more importantly learn how to learn Develop engaged, productive and contributing citizens for building an equitable, inclusive and plural society as envisaged by our Constitution Achieve economic and social mobility, inclusion and equality by ensuring all students can access quality education, with particular focus on historically marginalised, disadvantaged, and underrepresented groups Prepare a workforce with multidisciplinary abilities across the sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities through experiential, holistic, integrated, inquiry-driven, discovery-oriented, learner-centred, discussion-based, flexible and enjoyable education The curricular expectations related to different age-groups are spelt out stage-wise for various levels- primary, upper primary, secondary and senior secondary. These are stated at a broader level and pitched at an appropriate level of students understanding. In this document, curricular expectations as defined in 7 NCERT secondary stages learning outcomes document are referred. These curricular expectations form the basis for organising the age-appropriate content based on learners' prior knowledge. Curricular expectations for a subject are ascertained through a range and variety of specific learning outcomes defined for each class. The NCERT learning outcomes at the secondary stage are the primary point of reference for this document. Learning outcomes provide a benchmark on which learning progress can be tracked in both quantitative and qualitative manner. The NCERT learning outcomes linked with curricular expectations are indicator based and help to determine the pedagogical processes for their development. The indicator based learning encourages students to not only acquire knowledge but also apply knowledge and skills to successfully perform tasks in real life situations. 2.3 Identify Subject Specific Content Domains as per CBSE Syllabus The learning outcomes for each subject are expressed in terms of cognitive skill to be demonstrated and the content to be acquired by the learners. In accordance with the nature of the subject, the CBSE curricula aligns content domains to various textbook chapters for every subject. To help teachers see the connection between syllabus, textbook and learning outcomes, relevant NCERT learning outcomes are mapped to each of these content domains/ themes. 2.4 Define Subject Specific Cognitive Levels Cognitive levels describe the thinking processes that students are expected to engage in when encountering the indicators. Revised Bloom's taxonomy provides a useful frame of reference to classify the learning outcomes. It also helps in aligning the classroom pedagogy and assessment practices with the learning outcomes. In this document, an attempt is made to define the subject specific cognitive levels that essentially draw from Revised Bloom's Taxonomy. Such subject specific cognitive levels are able to capture the disciplinary knowledge and skills in a concrete manner. Assessment frameworks developed by Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) are referred to while conceptualising these subject specific cognitive levels.8 2.5 Devise Indicators for Every Learning Outcome The overarching learning outcomes are further broken down into specific indicators aligned to the subject specific skills and the content in related chapters in the textbook. They are focused on subject specific skills that students need to attain through different concepts addressed in the CBSE curriculum. A clear understanding of the scope of these learning outcomes for each concept dealt within a textbook chapter will be immensely helpful for both teachers and students to plan their teaching and learning in a better way. Therefore, indicators aligned to subject specific skills are defined for every learning outcome. These indicators: Are aligned to the goals of teaching the subject at the secondary stage Are defined as specific, measurable, and demonstrable indicators Are distributed across all content domains/ themes as per the prescribed CBSE syllabus Address 21st century skills including collaboration, communication, creativity, and critical thinking across school subjects Range from simple to complex cognitive processes for all subjects Are supplemented with sample assessment strategies and provide suggestions to concretise these in the classrooms Aims of school education Stage wise curricular expectations IndicatorsClass wise learning outcomes Subject specific cognitive levels Subject specific content domains 9 2.6 Design Sample Pedagogical Processes and Assessment Strategies NCERT secondary stage learning outcomes document provides a common set of pedagogical processes for each subject. The specific indicators are further supported with sample pedagogical and assessment strategies. This has been done to enable teachers to derive principles for making the alignment between learning outcomes, pedagogical practices, and assessment in their classrooms. The key principles considered while designing the pedagogical processes and assessment strategies are: Student-centred {Since new knowledge is built over existing knowledge, both pedagogy and assessment shall focus on learners' pre-requisite knowledge, skills, attitudes, and beliefs that they bring into a classroom setting. {Constructivist approaches to learning, with the learners being at the center of the learning process as an active constructor of knowledge shall be emphasised. {Since learners effectively learn by doing, classroom processes shall involve activities and analysis on issues surrounding the environment. {Cooperative and peer-supported teaching learning activities shall be used to empower learners to take charge of their own learning. Indicators centred {The focus shifts to measurable and observable behavior of what learners do at the end of an instruction. {Learners comprehend better when the method of teaching, learning activities and assessment strategies are all aligned well to the indicators. Pedagogical processes and assessment strategies shall be aligned to both content domains and cognitive skills as indicated in indicator statements. Assessment centred {Assessments should be viewed as an integral part of pedagogy and focus on giving timely individualised feedback to learners. Quality formative assessments shall be designed as it helps to modulate learners understanding of their own learning and helps teachers adapt their pedagogy based on learner performances. {Multiple modes of assessment, including portfolios, project work, presentations, written and oral assignments, shall be used to provide a scope to reflect individual capacities of a learner. {Peer assessment involving learners assessing the work of their peers against set assessment criteria shall be used.10 2.7 Develop Question Paper Design Question paper design also called as blueprint is a map and a detailed specification that ensures that all aspects of the curriculum are covered by the question paper. It translates the design in operational terms and all the dimensions of an item (content domain and cognitive level) become clear to the question paper developer. The information in the question paper design pertains to the content domains and; cognitive levels that will be tested; number of assessment items; aggregation of the percentages of content domains and cognitive levels. A balanced design adequately represents all the content domains and uniformly addresses a range of cognitive skills. This is a planning document where all the relevant information of a question paper is listed in the form of a table. 2.8 Design Sample Select Response and Constructed Response Assessment Items A test developer may decide on the item format/item type that will be used in the test. Broadly item formats are of two kinds- Selected response questions like multiple choice questions, true/false where learner has to select the correct response from the options provided and Constructed response questions- where the learner has to produce the correct response. These could be as short as one-word responses to long essay type questions. A sample set of assessment items of both select response type and constructed response type is included in this document. 2.9 Develop Marking Scheme The marking scheme is as important as the assessment item. For assessment item, particularly those assessing understanding and other cognitive levels, it is necessary to include variations in learner responses. There should be scope for fully correct, partially correct, levels of partially correct responses. Also, the marking scheme should be aligned to the cognitive level of the item. If an item is testing application of a concept, the marking scheme should illustrate the possible responses that could be representing application. At any given point of time the marking scheme would only be indicative - it may not include an exhaustive summary of all possible responses.11 3. Potential Users/ Uses of the Document Classroom teaching, learning and assessment: This document will be helpful for teachers and learners to see the connection between syllabus, textbook and learning outcomes. The indicators can be used to effectively plan classroom pedagogy and design formative assessment. The indicators can also be used by students to self-assess and plan their learning effectively. Pre-service and In-service Teacher Professional Development: This document can be utilised for developing content for professional development programs for teachers both at the pre-service and in-service level. The sample pedagogical processes and assessment strategies will provide student teachers as well as in-service teachers an insight on how to concretise the learning outcomes in the classroom. Textbook development: Clearly stated indicators could also facilitate the review and revision of the text books used for secondary stage, and in the designing of new textbooks. Developing Assessment Frameworks and tools for large scale assessments/surveys: This document may be used at the developing assessment frameworks and question papers for board examinations of different states leading to uniformity in quality standards across states. It could be used as a framework for drawing key indicators for National Achievement Survey (NAS). Reporting the assessment data against these outcomes will provide a comprehensive overview of the education system in the country. 4. The Nature of Science Among many ways in which the inquiring and imaginative human mind engages, expresses, and explains nature's wonder is through science. It is a human endeavour that observes the physical and biological environment carefully, looks for any meaningful patterns, processes, and relations, making and using new tools to interact with nature, and building conceptual models to understand the world. Also, the knowledge developed helps understand the evolutionary past, current state and predict the future of humanity and nature. It provides us with a way to present ideas that can be tested, repeated, and verified. Scientists gather evidence (as opposed to \"proof\") to support or falsify hypotheses. Theories, laws, and principles are supported, modified, or replaced as new evidence appears and are central to scientific thinking. Despite many attempts to shrug it off in textbook chapters and a note to the teacher section, the prevailing perception on the nature of doing science is through the scientific method and not a scientific method. And that method is linear. This perception of the nature of doing science needs countering, for the art of doing science is a creative, iterative, and interconnected process built on curiosity, healthy scepticism, and questioning. While science is at its best in understanding simple linear systems of nature, its predictive or explanatory power is limited when it comes to dealing with non- linear complex systems of nature. Yet, with all its limitations and failings, science is unquestionably the most reliable and powerful knowledge system about 12 the physical world known to humans, augmenting the spirit of enquiry, creativity, objectivity, and aesthetic sensibility leading towards the development of scientific temper. The school science curriculum across classes could gradually nurture scientific temper through appropriate learning opportunities. NCF 2005 position paper on teaching of science at secondary stage emphasises the learning of science as a composite discipline, in doing so, it encourages the designing of advanced technological modules, analysing issues of health and the surrounding environment, and experimenting systematically to discover and verify theoretical principles. In a progressive forward-looking society, science can play a truly liberating role, helping people out of the vicious circle of poverty, ignorance, and superstition. In a democratic political framework, the possible aberrations and misuse of science can be checked by the people themselves. Science, tempered with wisdom, is the surest and the only way to human welfare. This conviction provides the basic rationale for science education. 5. Secondary Stage Curricular Expectations The Constitution's Fundamental Duty 'to develop the scientific temper, humanism, and the spirit of inquiry and reforms begins at the primary stage and manifests beautifully at the secondary stage across subjects as scientific literacy is not the sole look out of science learners. The NCERT curricular expectations articulate that aspect of science education at the content and cognitive dimensions. A thematically built content spread across classes IX and X adheres to the validities of teaching science. SNo. NCERT Secondary Level Curricular Expectations CE1 Develop understanding of concepts, principles, theories and laws governing the physical world, consistent with the stage of cognitive development. CE2Develop ability to acquire and use the methods and processes of science, such as observing, questioning, planning investigations, hypothesising, collecting, analysing and interpreting data, communicating explanations with evidence, justifying explanations, thinking critically to consider and evaluate alternative explanations, etc. CE3 Conduct experiments, also involving quantitative measurements. CE4 Appreciate how concepts of science evolve with time giving importance to its historical perspectives. CE5 Develop scientific temper (objectivity, critical thinking, freedom from fear and prejudice, etc.). CE6 Nurture natural curiosity, aesthetic sense, and creativity. CE7 Imbibe the values of honesty, integrity, cooperation, concern for life and preservation of environment. CE8 Develop respect for human dignity and rights, equity, and equality.13 6. Content Domains The science content up to Class X is not framed along disciplinary lines, but rather organised around themes that are potentially cross-disciplinary in nature. The same set of themes are used, from Class VI to X. The themes included are: Food; Materials; The world of the living; How things work; Moving things; People and ideas; Natural phenomena and Natural resources. While these run all through, in the higher classes, there is a consolidation of content which leads to some themes being absent, e.g., Food from Class X.

Subject Specific Cognitive Levels At the secondary stage, the curriculum emphasis is on comprehension of concepts, principles, and laws of science and not on mere formal definitions. Science at this stage also relies on inference and interpretation. Experimentation, often involving quantitative measurement, as a tool to discover/verify theoretical principles is an important part of the curriculum at this stage. Considering the nature of learning outcomes defined for science, the cognitive levels can be divided into three domains that describe the thinking processes students shall engage in and consequently demonstrate the expected outcomes. 1. Knowing - This domain addresses the student's ability to recall, recognise, describe, and provide examples of facts, concepts, and procedures that are necessary for a sound foundation in science. Accurate and broad-based factual knowledge enables students to successfully engage in more complex cognitive activities essential to the scientific enterprise. Recall/ Recognise Identifies or states facts, relationships, and concepts. Identifies the characteristics or properties of specific organisms, materials, and processes. Identifies the appropriate uses for scientific equipment and procedures. Recognises and uses scientific vocabulary, symbols, abbreviations, units, and scales. Describe Describes or identifies descriptions of properties, structures, and functions of organisms and materials. Identifies relationships among organisms, materials, processes, and phenomena. Provide Examples Provides or identifies examples of organisms, materials, and processes that possess certain specified characteristics. Clarifies statements of facts or concepts with appropriate examples. 2. Applying - This domain focuses on using this knowledge to compare, contrast, and classify groups of objects or materials; relating knowledge of a science concept to a specific context; generating explanations; and solving practical problems. Learners here are required to engage in applying knowledge of facts, relationships, processes, concepts, equipment, and methods in real-life contexts and expanding dimensions of this acquired knowledge. Knowing Applying Reasoning15 Compare/Contrast/Classify Identifies or describes similarities and differences between groups of organisms, materials, or processes. Distinguishes, classifies, or sorts individual objects, materials, organisms, and processes based on characteristics and properties. Relate Relates knowledge of an underlying science concept to an observed or inferred property, behavior, or use of objects, organisms, or materials. Use Models Uses diagrams or models to demonstrate knowledge of science concepts, to illustrate a process, cycle, relationship, or system, or to find solutions to science problems. Interpret Information Uses knowledge of science concepts to interpret or calculate relevant textual, tabular, pictorial, and graphical information/data. Explain Provides or identifies an explanation for an observation or a natural phenomenon using a science concept or principle. 3. Reasoning - In this domain, learners are engaged in reasoning to analyse data and other information, draw conclusions, and extend their understandings to new situations. In contrast to the more direct applications of scientific facts and concepts exemplified in the applying domain, learning outcomes in the reasoning domain involve unfamiliar or more complicated contexts. Scientific reasoning also encompasses developing hypotheses and designing scientific investigations within and beyond classrooms. Analyse Identifies the elements of a scientific problem and use relevant information, concepts, relationships, and data patterns to answer questions and solve problems. Synthesise Answers questions that require consideration of several different factors or related concepts. Formulate Questions/ Hypothesise/ Predict Formulates questions that can be answered by investigation and predicts the results of an investigation, given information about the design. Formulates testable assumptions based on conceptual understanding and knowledge from experience, observation, and/or analysis of scientific information. Uses evidence and conceptual understanding to make predictions about the effects of changes in biological or physical conditions. Design Investigations Plans investigations or procedures appropriate for answering scientific questions or testing hypotheses. Describes or recognises the characteristics of well-designed investigations in terms of variables to be measured and controlled, and cause and effect relationships. Evaluate Evaluates alternative explanations. Weighs advantages and disadvantages to make decisions about alternative processes and materials. Evaluates results of investigations with respect to the sufficiency of data to support conclusions. Draw Conclusions Makes valid inferences based on observations, evidences, and/or understanding of science concepts. Draws appropriate conclusions that address questions or hypotheses. Demonstrates understanding of cause and effect. Generalise Makes general conclusions that go beyond the experimental or given conditions; applies conclusions to new situations. Justify Uses evidence and science understanding to support the reasonableness of explanations, solutions to problems, and conclusions from investigations.16 The following tables showcase how the three domains of the cognitive dimension can take root for a chapter. A given concept may or may not tick all the thinking processes that fall under three domains of Knowing, Applying and Reasoning.
