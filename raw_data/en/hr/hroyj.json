As with the authorisation of medicinal prod-ucts, it is necessary to verify the quality, effi- cacy and safety of vaccines, too. Based on the documentation available to Swissmedic, the following COVID -19 vaccines meet these re- quirements have been tion\" (AEFI) are recorded in the vigilance sys- tems of the national authorities and are ana-lysed so that appropriate risk -minimis ing measures can be swiftly taken. Based on observations made during the con-trolled clinical trials, a number of non- serious and very frequent COVID -19 vaccine AEFI were already known at the time of authorisa-tion. These include pain and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, shivering, fever, head- ache, and muscle and joint pain. Since the vaccination campaigns were launched, a steady stream of valuable find- ings has been obtained regarding AEFI that were either previously unknown, occur only infrequently o r are classified as severe; these are then discussed at both the national level and internationally with partner authorities. Switzerland's Regional Pharmacovigilance Centres (RPVC) are involved in the assessment process and, based on the reports received, have produced evaluations of certain AEFI: Herpes z oster after immunisation with mRNA- based vaccines Neuralgi c amyotrophy following admi - nistration of an mRNA against COVID -19 COVID -19-mRNA vaccines and recognised the problem of \"COVID arm\" and has produced a case report describing a delayed local reaction around the injection site. In addition, a Swissmedic contribution on \"C OVID arm\" was published to supplement the regular update reports on side effects following COVID -19 vaccinations in Switzerland (see page 22). So that healthcare professionals and patients can readily report AEFI, Swissmedic has opti- mised the electronic capture of these reports. You can find information about correct re-porting in the article \"Market surveillance of COVID -19 vaccines: reporting suspected side effects correctly\".

Swissmedic Vigilance -News | Edition 26 - June 2021 4 | 26 Important information Market surveillance of COVID -19 vaccines: reporting suspected side effects correctly Since the start of the COVID -19 vaccination campaign in Switzerland, Swissmedic has re- ceived many reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADR) and numerous inquiries about safety aspects of the vaccines used. Healthcare professionals and affected indi- viduals can make a crucial contribution to the efficient market surveillance of COVID -19 vaccines by following the advice given be-low. Apart f rom their desired effect, medicines can also produce side effects in some patients. In order to quickly identify safety signals, i.e. in- formation about very rare or as yet unknown adverse drug reactions, correct side effect re-ports are essential. Only then can new drug risks be rapidly identified and safety measures promptly introduced and communicated. As part of the worldwide vaccination cam-paigns against the new coronavirus, the spon- taneous reporting system has, for example, enabled rare allergic reactions (anaphylaxis), delayed local skin reactions or a possible link between vector -based COVID -19 vaccines and the very rare condition of thrombocytopenia thrombosis syndrome (TTS, also known as vac-cine- induced immune thrombotic thrombocy- topenia (VITT)) to be identified in good time and measures to be taken to improve drug safety. Reporting side effects : Information for healthcare professionals Serious or as yet unknown adverse drug reac-tions (ADR), i.e. those not listed in the product information, should be reported. During the vaccination campaign against COVID -19, doc- tors should report all ADR that they feel are medically relevant. For this purpose, please always use the elec- tronic Swissmedic reporting portal \"ElViS\" (Electronic Vigilance System). Since the end of January, users with a HIN account can also use their access details to report via the Swiss-medic online tool. After authentication, a red button leads di- rectly to a specific report form for COVID -19 vaccines. When the respective vaccine in this form is selected, some of the fields are pre- filled automatically in order to further sim- plify the reporting process. Reports sent using other forms or by e -mail lead to considerable delays in processing and often necessitate follow -up queries that could otherwise be avoided. Important : Known, non -serious reactions are not subject to the reporting obligation pre- scribed by Art. 59 of the Therapeutic Products Act (TPA). The known, non- serious and very common reactions to COVID -19 vaccines in- clude transitory pain and swelling at the in- jection site, fatigue, shivering, fever, head-ache and muscle and joint pain. These passing local and general reactions are normally a sign of the body dealing with the vaccine and do not need to be reported. Anyone who reports a side effect using more than one route should mention this fact in any subsequent reports so that double- re- porting can be identified if possible. Swissmedic Vigilance -News | Edition 26 - June 2021 5 | 26 Important information for pharmaceutical companies regarding electronic pharmacovigilance reporting Background The number of reports of adverse drug reac- tions (ADR) has risen steadily in recent years. This trend has increasingly been observed both in Switzerland and in other countries in recent years. The increase is primarily at- tributable to a rise in the number of reports received from the pharmaceutical industry. To ensure that reports are processed promptly and possible risks are identified swiftly in future too, Swissmedic continually adapts its wor king methods and conducts them on a paperless basis as far as possible . Consequences for marketing authorisation holders It should be borne in mind that, as of 1 July 2021, Swissmedic will only accept electronic reports either via a Gateway connection or through the ElViS (Electronic Vigilance Sys- tem) portal. Registration processes are required for both options. The E2B Gateway is reserved for use by companies submitting more than 50 re- ports a year. The ElViS electronic reporting system is suitable particu larly for small and medium -sized companies. Gateway ElViS -Portal Thomas Schwartz, MD Safety of Medicines division, Swissmedic From 1 Jul y 2021 only electronic reports will be accepted . Swissmedic Vigilance -News | Edition 26 - June 2021 6 | 26 Important information for pharmaceutical companies regarding pharmacovigilance reporting of drug exposure during pregnancy to Swissmedic Swissmedic has updated the reporting re- quirements as of 10 May 2021. Summary The information sheet containing instructions regarding \"Drug exposure during pregnancy and parent -child reports from Switzerland\" has recently been updated on the website of Swissmedic, under the link: Instructions and information sheets (swissmedic.ch) . Consequently, the following main changes must be borne in mind with regard to report- ing procedures: In case drug exposure during pregnancy is suspected with a substance known to be noxious, i.e. a substance which is contrain- dicated and should be avoided during pregnancy due to potential risk of adverse reactions for the foetus/child, but no com- plication during pregnancy occurred and no harmful effect on the foetus/child at the time of the report is suspected, the In- dividual Case Safety Report (ICSR) should be submitted as \"non- serious\" (within 60 days) . For reporting instructions and timelines regarding s afety signals, the following Swissmedic guidance document must also be consulted: MU101_20_001e_WL Guid- ance document Drug Safety Signals HMP (PDF, kB, 01.03.2021) - see division, Swissmedic Vigilance -News | Edition 26 - June 2021 7 | 26 Drug safety and signals Case report of a delayed local reaction at the injection site (\"COVID arm\") Swissmedic is increasingly receiving reports of delayed local reactions around the injec- tion site following a vaccination to protect against COVID -19. Most of the reports to date involve the COVID -19 vaccine from Moderna. The reports of redness and swell-ing predominantly occur around one week after the vaccination and have also been ob-served in other countries (so- called \"COVID arm\"). According to the latest findings, this is a temporary and harmless reaction con-nected with the activation of the body's im-mune system that disappears again after a few days. Swissmedic first reported on this issue on its website on 19 February 2021 (1). These delayed local react ions can occur around one week after the vaccination and usually manifest themselves as a well -de- fined area of red, swollen skin on the in-jected arm, in some cases accompanied by pain and/or itching. These reactions improve without further measures after a few days. In the authorisation study for the COVID -19 vaccine from Moderna, such reactions were observed in 0.8% of vaccinated subjects af-ter the first dose and in 0.2% after the sec-ond dose. Accordingly, their frequency is currently classed as \"uncommon\" ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100). In the USA these reactions have also been termed \"COVID arm\" in the me- dia. In a number of the reports to Swissmedic it appears that some people with reactions that were retrospectively considered to be probable delayed local reacti ons had been treated with an antibiotic, based on the pre-sumably incorrect suspicion of a bacterial skin infection (erysipelas). The exact mechanism underlying these reac- tions is not known. The interval corresponds to the first occurrence of the antibodies and immune cells induced by the vaccination. In severe cases, treatment with analgesics or antihistamines can be considered. In some cases, there is uncertainty as to whether patients with a delayed local skin reaction should receive the second dose of the vaccine. The second dose is important for effective vaccine protection. There is no rea-son to skip or delay the second dose in the individuals concerned. Some authors recommend injecting the sec- ond dose of the vaccine in the other arm. A letter to the editor published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 3 March 2021 (2) described a series of 12 patients with delayed \"large\" local reactions after vaccination with mRNA -1273 SARS -CoV-2 vaccine. As a possible pathological mecha- nism, the authors suspec t a delayed- type, T - cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. This suspicion was supported by skin imens showing superficial perivascular and perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates with scattered eosinophils and mast cells. All 12 patients had received the second dose of vaccine: half of them did not experience a recurrence of delayed local reactions, three patients had recurrent reactions that were similar in intensity and three had reactions that were of a lower grade. Photos documenting the course over time of a female patient who developed COVID arm after COVID -19 vaccination with Moderna are shown below. The patient had a history of grass pollen allergy and an allergy to co-amoxicillin. The 28- year-old woman received her first vaccination with the active substance from Swissmedic Vigilance -News | Edition 26 - June 2021 8 | 26 Moderna. Six days later, the patient noticed stabbing pains in her armpit on moving her arm, and enlarged lymph nodes were palpa-ble in her axilla on the same day. The patient was afebrile at all times. The local reaction developed a s follows The photos were kindly made available to Swissmedic for publication by the person concerned. The patient was given an antihistamine one hour before the second dose of vaccine, which she continued to take for several days afterwards. No symptoms occurred at the in- jection site, but she did experience shivering, raised temperature and malaise after the second vaccination .Literature (1) Safety of COVID-19 vaccines: Reports of delayed lo- cal reactions (swissmedic.ch) (2) Blumenthal KG, Freeman EE, Saff RR, Robinson LB, Wolfson AR, Foreman RK, et al.

Alessandro Ceschi, MSc1,4 1 Regional Pharmacovigilance Centre, Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Institute of Pharmacological Sciences of Southern Switzerland, Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale, Lug ano, Switzerland 2 Neurocent re of Southern Switzerland, Ente Ospedaliero Cantonale, Lugano, Switzerland 3 Neurocentre of St.Gallen Cantonal Hospital, S. Gallen, Switzerland 4 Faculty of Biomedical Sciences, Universit\u00e0 della Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland Introduction Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) - also as \"Parsonage- Turner syndrome\" (1) or \"bra- chial neuritis\" - is a painful peripheral neu- ropathy that causes a monophasic course of severe paresis, predominately in the upper extremit ies (2). The typical NA phenotype may be seen in a patient who awakens with new-onset unilateral pain in the shoulder, neck or upper arm that becomes unbearable (numeric rating scale score of 7/10) within a few hours. Several hours to 1 -2 weeks later paresis develops, typically involving the long thoracic, suprascapular, and/or anterior in- terosseous nerves. The neuropathic pain may last up to six weeks and does not respond to conventional analgesic treatment (i.e. non - steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs and opi- oids). Amyotrophy usually becomes evident after a couple of weeks. The majority of NA cases are unilateral , but bilateral involve- ment can be seen in 30% of cases (1). Previous estimates of the annual incidence of NA were 3/100,000/year, but more recent studies suggest a much higher incidence (1/1,000/year) (3). The exact pathogenesis in NA is still un- known, but is most likely multifactorial. An interplay between environmental factors (i.e., infection or immune triggers), mechan- ical factors (repetitive or strenuous motor tasks) and genetic susceptibility (e.g. muta-tions in the septin 9 gene) are potentially in- volved in the development of NA. Preceding events such as infections, surgery and vac-cination are reported in about half of NA cases (2, 4) . Recently, hepatitis E emerged as a possible infectious trigger, especially in bi-lateral cases (5, 6) . Moreover, sever al vac- cinations have been associated with NA (4): typhoid, diphtheria, tetanus toxoid (7), smallpox, flu (9, 10) , and human papilloma virus (11, 12) . In these cases, NA symptoms usually start a few days/one week after vac-cination (4). Prognosis may be related to the amount of axonal damage, and later to chronic biome- chanical impairment and articular degenera- tion of the shoulder joint, with long- term pain and fatigue (13). Most patients with NA are young, healthy and employed, and some of them cannot return to work for several months or years, depending on their type of occupation (13). Patients with phrenic nerve palsy (especially if bilateral) may need non- invasive, long -term ventilation; this can hap- pen in up to 8% of cases (14) . Cases of COVID -19 vaccine - related NA We describe two recent cases of suspected NA reported after vaccination with Co-mirnaty \u00ae and one after vaccination with COVID -19 vaccine Moderna which were eval- uated for causality by the Ticino Regional Pharmacovigilance Centre, as the referenc e pharmacovigilance COVID -19 vac- cine 40 -year-old woman with no previous sig- nificant medical history or pharmacological therapy developed severe left shoulder pain 24 h after the first dose of Comirnaty\u00ae was administered in the left del toid muscle. The pain was described as sudden onset, noctur- nal, unbearable burning (neuropathic) pain Swissmedic Vigilance -News | Edition 26 - June 2021 10 | 26 in the left shoulder and deltoid muscle re- gion, which did not respond to paracetamol. When the pain started to decrease a couple of days later, the patient realised that the left upper limb was very weak: she was una- ble to abduct the arm, flex the elbow and ul- timately perform hand movements. Since her upper arm was plegic, the patient was referred to a neurologist, an expert in neu-romuscular diseases, who documented amy- otrophy and weakness of the deltoid and bi- ceps of neuralgic Electromyog- raphy performed one month after onset documented neurogenic recruitment in the biceps muscle with no spontaneous act ivity at rest. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brachial plexus and the upper arm were nor- mal; in particular, there were no signs of muscle denervation. The patient started an intensive programme of physiotherapy and improved significantly. Based on the t em- poral relationship between vaccine admin- istration and symptom development, and since other causes were excluded, the causal correlation between NA and COVID -19 vac- cine administration was evaluated as possi- ble. A previously healthy 36 -year-old man devel- oped severe left shoulder and arm pain 18 days after the second dose of Comirnaty \u00ae was administered in the left deltoid muscle. The severe pain, which was treated by the patient with nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory drugs, was accompanied by weakness in the left arm that led to motor deficit and paresis. Three days after onset, the symptoms started to resolve. Neurological investigations con- firmed a mild form of NA. Since other path- ophysiological causes were excluded, the causal assessment for NA withComirnaty \u00ae administration was considered at least possi-ble A 67 -year-old man known to have arterial hypertension treated with metoprolol, dyslipidaemia treated with pravastatin, and drug allergy to diclofenac, developed sud- den severe left shoulder pain (described b y the man as not dependent on movement or load and occurring in any position) 8 days af- ter the second dose of COVID -19 vaccine Moderna was administered in the left del-toid muscle. The man denied having suf- fered any shoulder injury. Non- steroidal anti-infla mmatory drugs did not relieve the pain. Subsequently, he was treated with cor-tisone and the pain gradually improved. Or- thopaedic examination revealed paresis of the left shoulder and neurological investiga-tions confirmed the diagnosis of NA. Labor- atory inv estigation excluded inflammatory causes. Based on the plausible temporal re- lationship between vaccine administration and NA onset, in the absence of alternative causes, causality was assessed as possible. VigiBase data and discussion The official Swiss product information for Comirnaty \u00ae does not report NA among the known neurological adverse events follow-ing immunisation (AEFI), and a search in PubMed and other international databases did not yield results for the two COVID -19 mRNA vaccines authorised in Sw itzerland. Up to 28 April 2021, 602,990 individual case safety reports have been reported world-wide in association with COVID -19 vaccines in VigiBase, the World Health Organization's global pharmacovigilance database of sus-pected adverse drug reactions. Of these, 30 individual case safety reports concerned NA. In 24 individual case safety reports NA was reported in association with Comirnaty \u00ae, in three with COVID -19 vaccine Moderna, and in three with Vaxzevria\u00ae. The geographical distribution of COVID -19 vaccine -related safety reports of NA is heter- ogeneous: 10 safety reports are from the United States, 6 from the Netherlands, 5 Swissmedic Vigilance -News | Edition 26 - June 2021 11 | 26 from Germany, 4 from Spain, 3 from Switzer- land, and one each from Austria, Italy and France. 21 safety reports involve women and the median age is 50 years (interquartile range, IQR, 40 -57 years, range 26-89 years). 21 safety reports are categorised by the re- porter as serious (for being disabling/inca- pacitating, n=8; for causing medically im-portant conditions, n=9; for hospitalisation, n=4). Eight safety reports were rated as non-serious while for one safety report the seriousness was not re- ported. COVID -19 vaccines are the sole suspected drugs in all these safety reports. In 24 safety reports, NA is reported in associ-ation with a single COVID -19 vaccination (unknown whether the first or the second dose), with a median time- to-onset of 5 days (IQR 1 -12 days, range 0- 19 days). In one safety report NA occurred 23 days after the first dose of Comirnaty \u00ae and 2 days after the second dose; in one safety report NA oc- curred 23 days after the first dose of Co- mirnaty\u00ae and 0 days after the second dose; and in one safety report NA occurred 54 days after the first dose of Comirnaty \u00ae and 18 days after the second dose. In three safety reports, it is not possible to define the NA time to onset of NA as the dates of vaccina- tion and NA onset are only partially rec-orded. Disproportionality analysis to assess whether a signal of disproportionate reporting exists for the NA/COVID -19 vaccine(s) combination shows increased reporting of NA with COVID -19 vaccines against both t he propor- tion of NA reported in combination with any other drug recorded in VigiBase and the pro-portion of other adverse events reported in combination with COVID -19 vaccines. The re- porting odds ratio (ROR) used as a measure of disproportionate reporting i s 2.2 with the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for the ROR measurement at 1.5. As signal detection depends on the number of safety reports gathered in VigiBase, which con-stantly changes, disproportionality analysis should be reassessed at regular intervals for confirmation and generation of hypotheses worthy of further investigation. Conclusions The three cases described above, together with the data obtained from VigiBase, raise the hypothesis that mRNA COVID -19 vac- cines could be related to and potentially trigger NA. This potential safety signal de-serves further investigation. Meanwhile, cli-nicians should be aware of this possibility in order to promptly identify and refer the pa- tients, consider starting treatment (usually with oral corticostero ids) and report the sus- pected cases to Swissmedic.

Imke Ortland, PharmD , PhD; Karl Nowak, MD Regional Pharmacovigilance Zurich, Depart- ment of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Univer-sity Hospital Zurich Introduction The SARS -CoV-2 vaccines Comirnaty\u00ae (tozi- nameran) and COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna have been authorised in Switzerland since 19 December 2020 and 12 January 2021, respec-tively (1). Comirnaty \u00ae is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by the SARS -CoV-2 virus in individuals 12 years of age and older. The product infor- mation recommends the administration of Comirnaty \u00ae, after dilution of the active sub- stance, as a vaccination course of two doses at least 21 days apart (2) . COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna is authorised for active immunisa-tion to prevent COVID -19 caused by the SARS -CoV-2 virus in individuals 18 years of age and older. The product information re- commends its administration, again after di- lution, as a vaccination course of two doses at least 28 days apart (2). Both of these prod- ucts are mRNA vaccines. mRNA vaccines are dead vaccines and do not contain any adju-vants or preservatives (3). The mRNA con- tains the coded informa tion about the spikes of the SARS -CoV-2 viral envelope (glycopro- tein), which is recognised by the body as for-eign, thereby triggering an immune re-sponse (4). The varicella zoster virus (VZV, human her-pesvirus 3, HHV -3) is an alphaherpes virus. Eight human pathogenic herpesviruses have been described to date, including the herpes simplex viruses (HSV) HSV1 and HSV2 (5). Most people are first exposed to VZV during childhood in the form of chickenpox and usually recover without any major complica- tions. After an initial infection, VZV remains in the sensory nerves or in satellite cells sur- rounding the neurons, where they can be re- activated at a later date (6) . VZV reactivation occurs mainly in older individuals with a compromised immune status and manifests itself as herpes zoster (HZ, shingles). During reactivation, the VZV migrates from the sen-sory ganglia to the nerve endings, where it causes the visible outbreak of the infection in the area of skin innervated by the nerve endings. The skin rash is often prec eded by episodes of pain. The incubation period for the primary chickenpox infection is usually 14-16 days, although incubation periods of 8-21 days have also been observed (7) . The incidence of HZ increases markedly with age and the associated general w eakening of the immune system: w hile the incidence at the age of 50 is 3 cases per 1,000, an inci-dence of 10 cases per 1,000 is described from the age of 80 (8) . Other risk factors for her- pes zoster include autoimmune diseases, or- gan transplants and the admi nistration of immunosuppressive drugs, psychol ogical stress and female gender (9). Case reports Between January and April 2021, 24 case re-ports of herpes zoster shortly after with Comirnaty \u00ae or COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna were reported to the Regional Pharmacovigilance Centre Zurich (RPV C). The individuals affected were from 33 to 90 years of age and were distributed almost equally between the sexes. An overview of the corresponding cases is provided in Ta-ble 1. The median time between the immun- isation with a COVID -19 vaccine and the on- set of herpes zoster symptoms was 11 days. By way of example, we describe below a number of striking case reports of patients with no known risk factors for herpes zoster: Swissmedic Vigilance -News | Edition 26 - June 2021 14 | 26 Case 1: A 33-year-old man with no history of shingles developed a herpes zoster in- fection in the area of dermatome L1 a few days after the first immunisation with Co-mirnaty \u00ae. The symptoms regressed spon- taneously after two weeks. The patient was healthy and did not have any known pre-existing illnesses. Case 2: A 45-year-old woman received her first immunisation with Comirnaty\u00ae (tozi- nameran) 5 days before contracting a tho- racic herpes zoster infection. This was her first experience of this infection, which was initially treated with valaciclovir for 7 days. The symptoms quickly regressed, and her second vaccine dose was adminis- tered on schedule. Further details on the outcome of this case were not yet availa-ble at the time of the report. Case 3: A 41-year-old woman developed a herpes zoster infection on the left side of her chest 5 days after the first vaccination with Comirnaty \u00ae. Here, too, this was the first time that the patient had experi-enced such symptoms. After an initial 7 - day treatment with valaciclovir, the symp-toms regressed. The patient did not have a history of pre -existing illnesses, includ- ing immunosuppressive disorders. The second vaccine dose was likewise admin- istered on schedule. Case 4: A 60 -year-old woman was im- munised with Comirnaty \u00ae. A few days later she complained of pain in her mouth. A total of 15 days after the vac- cination, the patient was diagnosed with oral shingles following a positive varicella zoster virus PCR result. She was initially treated with Brivex \u00ae (brivudine), which quickly produced a significant improve-ment. Case 5: A 47 -year-old man received the vaccine Comirnaty \u00ae (tozinameran) as im- munisation against COVID -19. 33 days af- ter the second dose he developed herpes zoster, with classical blisters on a red background in the area of dermatomes T7 and T8. The patient did not have any pre - existing illnesses or relevant risk factors. All patients recovered from t heir herpes zos- ter in fections without any sequelae. The in- fections usually regressed following antiviral treatment. In one case, the herpes zoster in- fection resolved spontaneously.

In this report, by Bostan et al., a 78-year-old male patient with an unspecified COVID -19 vaccine (10). He complained of an erythematous, painful and pruritic skin lesion on his chest. He was treated with oral valaciclovir for a week. He had a history of coronary heart disease, cer-ebrovascular accident and chronic obstruc-tive pulmonary disease. The patient had un-dergone resection of a bladder tumour six years ago. At the time of imm unisation, the patient was not on any immunosuppressive therapy. A case series from Israel reported by Furer et al. describes six female patients aged 36 to 61 with pre- existing rheumatic disease who developed VZV reactivation shortly after im- munisation wi th Comirnaty \u00ae. However, the publication also points out that patients with rheumatic disease generally are twice as likely to suffer from a VZV reactivation. As a possible explanation for the VZV reactiva-tion associated with Comirnaty \u00ae, the authors refer to a stimulation of innate immunity through toll -like receptor -mediated (TLR) signalling pathways triggered by mRNA vac-cines (11). At the time of our searches (12 April 2021), the WHO pharmacovigilance database (Vigi- base) listed a total of 110,426 individual case safety reports for Comirnaty \u00ae received since 2020, including 274 cases of \"herpes zoster\" and 322 cases of \"shingles\". Most of these cases occurred in France (39.3%), Ger- many (12.7%) and Italy (11.1%). For Switzer-land, the WHO database lists just 20 cases (12). For COVID -19 Vaccine Moderna, Vigi- base documents a total of 8,077 individual case safety reports, 38 cases of \"herpes zos- ter\" and 25 cases of \"shingles\". Most of these cases have been observed in France (33.3%), Switzerland with 18 cases (27 .3%) and the Netherlands (12.1%). For the USA, 78 cases of \"herpes zoster\" are listed for the product named Moderna COVID -19 Vaccine in Vigibase (12). On 9 April 2021, Swissmedic published an update on the side effects of COVID -19 vac- cines in Switzerland, with 44 reported cases of herpes zoster infection, 26 of which were rated as serious. The average age of the af- fected patients was 72, and the symptoms appeared between one and 43 days after vaccination (13). VZV reactions have also been observed among CO VID-19 sufferers in otherwise im- munocompetent patients (14) . Other au- thors suggest that this may be due to COVID - 19-induced lymphopenia or functional ex- haustion of CD4+ cells (15, 16) . Moreover, Walter et. al. describe various cases in which VZV reactivat ions also oc- curred after vaccinations against influenza, hepatitis A, rabies and Japanese encephali-tis. The authors speculate that immunisa-tions by vaccines may induce suppression of cell-mediated immunity and thus trigger the reactivation of VZV (17) . Moodley et al. (2019) describe several cases of immunocom- petent children who, shortly after a VZV vac- cination, developed an HZ that appeared to be just as severe as an HZ infection with wild - type VZV (chickenpox) (18) . In 2020, the Drug Commission of the Germ an Medical As- sociation also published several case reports of herpes zoster and zoster -like skin lesions that occurred shortly vaccination with Shingrix \u00ae. One possible pathological mecha- nism discussed here is a high number of CD4- positive T lymphocyt es directed against gly- coprotein E and triggered by Shingrix\u00ae (19). Swissmedic Vigilance -News | Edition 26 - June 2021 16 | 26 Conclusion Herpes zoster of any type is not yet docu- mented in the Swiss product information, but may be a very rare and serious adverse drug reaction to COVID -19 vaccines. As de- scribed by Walter et al., cases of VZV reacti-vation have already occurred after immun-isation with various vaccines. The precise mechanism that causes COVID -19 vaccines to produce a VZV reactivation is still not clear. Since these vaccines have only been on the market for a short time and since only scant reports of said reactions have been de- scribed to date, further investigations are needed. However, a short -term alteration of the immune reponse by vac cination may play a role in the pathological mechanism. Although the spontaneously reported cases could involve a chance association, a close temporal relationship was observed, which means that a COVID -19 vaccination cannot be ruled out as a possible trigger of VZV re- activation. The case reports found in the WHO pharmacovigilance database indicate that herpes zoster after vaccination is not an isolated occurrence. Consequently, a more detailed analysis of the WHO database in fu- ture regarding the disproportionality be- tween the onset of herpes zoster and COVID -19 vaccinations would be of great in- terest. An analysis to ascertain whether the use of vec tor vaccines, for example the COVID -19 vaccine from AstraZeneca, leads to an increased occurrence of herpes zoster would also be interesting. Healthcare professionals should develop an awareness of the possibility of herpes zoster as an adverse drug reacti on to COVID -19 vac- cines and not hesitate to report correspond- ing (1) Ver\u00f6ffentlichung Iavarone, C., D.

Thrombocytopenia is not la-belled as an adverse drug reaction in the prescribing information for these vaccines (1, 2) . A small number of corresponding case reports can currently be found in the litera-ture (3, 4, 5, 6) , and a link between COVID - 19 vaccination and immune thrombocytope-nia (ITP) is currently under discussion (6). Cases of thrombocytopenia in connection with COVID -19 itself have also been de- scribed (7). In this newsletter article, we sum- marise the reports on thrombocytopenia as- sociated with COVID -19 mRNA vaccination that have been submitted to RPVC Basel, fo- cusing specifically on ITP. Methodology We consulted our in- house pharmacovigi- lance database at RPVC Basel for reports of thrombocytopenia in connection with a COVID -19 mRNA vaccination and extracted demographic and clinical data from the com- pleted reports. We also present data on im- mune thrombocytopenia (ITP) obtained from VigiBase. A detailed description of the VigiBase database is provided in a publica- tion by Lindquist (8) . Using the VigiLyze sys- searched term \"Immune thrombo-cytopenia\" according to the Medical Diction-ary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), Ver- sion 23.1. The vaccine names were coded ac- cording to the WHO Drug Dictionary, the in- ternational reference for drug -related infor- mation. Measured against various reporting guide-lines, data from VigiBase are inhomogene-ous worldwide and prone to \"underreport- ing\" and \"reporting bias\". Therefore the in- formation, at least in respect of origin and the probability that the vaccine has caused the adverse drug reaction, is not homogene- ous. Result s We identified six cases (12%), from a total of 49 reports on COVID -19 mRNA vaccines, which satisfied our search criteria. All cases were serious and unexpected. Details of the cases can be found in the table below. In four of the six cases, the thrombocytope-nia was a chance finding in connection with an emergency medical consultation due to another medical event. Symptoms (case no. 5) or thrombocytopenia occurred after the first vaccination in all cases. Two patients had a history of thrombocytopenic episodes, and two had known immune t hrombocyt o- penia (ITP or Evans syndrome). As at 4 April 2021, 213,977 reports regarding the vaccines listed above had been entered Swissmedic Vigilance -News | Edition 26 - June 2021 19 | 26 in VigiBase, including 115 cases related to ITP. With a statistically expected number of 58 ITP cases, the number of observed cases was therefore slightly higher than expected, fulfilling the statistical analysis criteria de- fined by the Uppsala Monitoring Centre for a signal in terms of an association. On the date this article was revised (20 May 2021), 381,624 reports relating t o the vaccines listed above had been entered s in VigiBase, including 235 ITP cases (expected number 106).

They can be divided into three main groups: impaired production (haematopoietic disorder), shortened lifespan of platelets (breakdown) and r edistribution. Among the cases of thrombocytopenia after a COVID -19 mRNA vaccination reported to RPVC Basel, im-paired production and co- medication with bone marrow suppressants was present in two cases (case nos. 4 and 6), and a short- ened platelet life span was present in four cases (case no. 5 platelet consumption with acute bleeding; case nos. 1, 2 and 3 with ITP). The episodes of thrombocytopenia were of-ten chance findings during a hospitalisation for other reasons. On the one hand, this may have prevent ed more serious outcomes . On the other hand, however, it raise s the ques- tion as to whether thrombocytopenia after vaccinations might often remain unob- served. No serious bleeding occurred due to the thrombocytopenia (the serious bleeding in patient 5 was at tributed to acquired hae- mophilia A). A possible risk factor for the onset of throm-bocytopenia after a COVID -19 mRNA vac- cination could pre- existing predisposi- tion to thrombocytopenia. Previous throm-bocytopenic episodes were documented for four of the patients (autoimmune ITP in two cases). A recently published case report de-scribes the onset of ITP after the first dose of tozinameran in a healthy 22- year-old man who was not on any other medication (3) . In- terestingly, two months before his vaccina- tion this patient had presented with a mild thrombocytopenia in connection with an acute respiratory infection. Of the 20 cases described by Lee et al., four either had a known ITP or had experienced previous epi- sodes of thrombocytopenia (6) . Whether earlier thrombocytopenic episodes are a risk factor for ITP after a COVID -19 mRNA vac- cination is currently a matter for speculation, but one that should be investigated further. As observed by Lee at al., our cases occurred after the first dose of the vaccine (6) . If the onset of ITP was purely coincidental, one would expect corresponding blood count abnormalities to be observed after a second vaccination as well. The fact that no ITP cases were reported after a second dose of the vaccine may, according to the authors, indi- cate a vaccine- induced reaction (6). On the other hand, this observation may be due to the much higher number of individuals hav-ing only received a first dose of a vaccine by the beginning of February 2021 compared to those who had already received two dos es. It should be borne in mind that the assess- ment of an association with new vaccines is complicated by the scarcity of available data. The causality of an adverse event following immunisation is a ssessed by the WHO using a 3-point scale (\"inconsistent with causal as- sociation to immunisation\", \"indetermi-nate\" or \"consistent with causal association to immunisation\"), and all new vaccine- re- lated events are classified as \"indetermi-nate\" (9). The known overall incidence of ITP is ap-proximately 3.3 per 100,000 adults/year (10). ITP often occurs in a temporal relationship with an infection in the preceding days or weeks, and has been described as a compli-cation of COVID -19 (7). ITP in connection with vacci nations has been diagnosed in rare cases, particularly for the MMR vaccine (1- 3 per 100,000 vaccinated children) and is nor-mally associated with a mild progression (11). A vaccination can induce ITP by various mechanisms, particularly by molecular mim-icry between viral and platelet proteins. Cross -reactive antiviral antibodies act as au- toantibodies by binding to platelets and in-ducing lysis through complement activation or cellular mechanisms. Swissmedic Vigilance -News | Edition 26 - June 2021 21 | 26 The safety signal for ITP after Vaccine AstraZeneca) is currently being investigated by the Pharmacovigi- lance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (12) . Conclusion Among the 49 reports linked w ith the ad- ministration of a COVID -19 mRNA vaccine submitted to RPVC Basel, six cases involve episodes of thrombocytopenia. An autoim- mune thrombocytopenia was present in three of these cases. VigiBase, the WHO da-tabase, currently includes a higher than ex- pected number of reports on ITP following a COVID -19 mRNA vaccination. It is important to keep a watchful eye on these serious ad-verse events and report them to the national drug regulatory authorities. The conclusions drawn from the post -marketing data in V igi- Base originate from the authors of this pub-lication and not from the Uppsala Monitor- ing Centre, the national pharmacovigilance centres or the World Health Organisation.
