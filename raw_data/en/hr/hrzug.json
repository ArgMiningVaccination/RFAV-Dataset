The pharmaceutical industry and its media cohort have been trying to discredit this ever since, collapsing benign supplement levels of vitamin C and megadose treatment as the same science. In this video Dr Peter Couttie, a 91 year-old orthomolecular practitioner and veterinary surgeon, shows his family how to make megadose vitamin C at home. Thank you to the Couttie family for making this workshop available to everyone. Dr Peter Couttie B.Sc., MRCVS., MACNEM. Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) Member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (MRCVS) Member of Australasian College of Nutritional and Environmental Medicine (MACNEM) Here's the recipe For this method you require seven main things - a measuring jug, a blender, 1 litre of water, an ultrasonic cleaner, a plastic mixing tool, 1/3 cup of pure sodium ascorbate salt crystals (vitamin C), and 1 cup of sunflower lecithin granules. Measure 700 cubic centimetres of water in your measuring jug. Add 1 cup of sunflower lecithin granules to the water and stir. Place this mix into your blender and turn it on the lowest setting. Measure 300 cubic centimetres of water in your measuring jug. Add 1/3 cup of pure sodium ascorbate salt crystals (vitamin C) to the water and stir. Place this mix into your blender with the lecithin and leave for 5 minutes. Tip the litre of mix into your ultrasonic cleaner (UC) and turn on. Gently stir the mix in the UC for 30 minutes. Bottle the mix and refrigerate immediately. Administer as required. Use within a month.
