The multi-centered, nationwide clinical trial is sponsored by the vaccine-maker Moderna. People who have received an organ transplant are at a high-risk for contracting COVID-19 and becoming severely sick. After receiving a transplant organ, immunosuppressive drugs may interfere with the recipient's ability to build a strong immune defense against the virus from the first doses of the virus. This trial will dose patients with an extra shot and monitor their immune antibody response 28 days from the third shot. \"Organ transplant recipients may not have as strong of an immune response to the COVID-19 vaccines as the general population does, leaving them vulnerable to the virus,\" said [Lewis Teperman, MD](https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/surgery/dr-lewis-william-teperman-md-11372627), director of transplant services for Northwell Health and principal investigator on the trial. \"We are eager to provide patients more vaccine to help protect them, and to gain much-needed scientific evidence to help doctors best treat their patients.\" The first trial participant to receive the shot - and first in the nation - was Darla Smyth, PhD, a high school English teacher from Hewett-Woodmere. After being diagnosed with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis more than 28 years ago and undergoing a [liver transplant](https://nsuh.northwell.edu/transplant-services/liver-transplant), Dr. Smyth was eager to roll up her sleeve. \"When you weigh the options - either get sick or get vaccinated again - my choice was clear. I am hoping this third shot will help give me some lasting protection from this virus.\" A third dose of the COVID-19 vaccines has proven effective for some with weakened immune systems, explains Lewis Teperman, MD, director of transplant services for Northwell Health. He addresses some of the top questions and concerns. People who have received a solid organ transplant within the last six months may qualify for the trial. Moderna is hoping 240 participants (including healthy volunteers) will be enrolled in the trial nationwide. The Feinstein Institutes is one of the seven sites leading the trial and the first to enroll. \"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Feinstein Institutes focused on conducting clinical trials in an effort to find safe and effective treatments,\" said [Christina Brennan, MD](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/dr-christina-brennan-joins-the-society-for-clinical-research-sites-leadership-council), vice president of clinical research at the Feinstein Institutes. \"Now, with the support of Moderna, we hope this vaccine clinical trial will give insight into the best way to protect a high-risk population.\" In March 2020, the Feinstein Institutes announced its [first set of clinical trials](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/feinstein-institutes-begins-enrolling-patients-in-multiple-covid-19-clinical-trials) focused on studying the safety and efficacy of potential COVID-19 therapies. Since then, Feinstein Institutes initiated more than 17 clinical trials and programs and enrolled more than 1,800 patients. Through Feinstein's COVID-19 Research Consortium (CRC), 500 clinicians, statisticians and scientists published more than 500 peer-reviewed manuscripts related to the virus in efforts to inform the public and research community. \"Clinical trials are essential to define effective methods to treat and prevent COVID-19,\" said [Kevin J. Tracey, MD](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/institutes-researchers/our-researchers/kevin-j-tracey-md), president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes. \"Dr. Teperman's trial to study vaccination of organ transplant patients is timely and important.\" Most recently, the Feinstein Institutes began to enroll patients in another national clinical trial that is [delivering extra shots of vaccines](https://feinstein.northwell.edu/news/the-latest/covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trial-in-people-with-autoimmune-disease-starts-at-feinstein) to patients with an autoimmune disease. Researchers will investigate whether antibody response to the vaccine is related to medications, disease and/or vaccine type.
