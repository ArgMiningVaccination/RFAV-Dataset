Texas Wesleyan University, founded in 1890 in Fort Worth, is a United Methodist institution with a tradition in the liberal arts and sciences and a focus on professional and career preparation. The University is committed to the principles that each student deserves personal attention and that all members of the academic community must have freedom to pursue independent thought and to exercise intellectual curiosity. The University endeavors to create a learning environment where each student is provided an opportunity to pursue individual excellence, to think clearly and creatively, and to communicate effectivel y. The University also strives to develop a sense of civic responsibility and spiritual sensitivity, with a commitment to moral discrimination and action. Texas Wesleyan University strives to develop informed, responsible, and articulate citizens. The Un iversity actively seeks and employs faculty and staff with commitment and dedication to teaching, inspiring, and serving students. Texas Wesleyan University recognizes its responsibility to the community by providing leadership and talent through programs that enable and enrich society. Undergraduate and graduate programs are offered on campus and through distance education. Faculty scholarship informs teaching and advances knowledge and understanding. Vision Texas Wesleyan University aspires to be a values and student - centered university where motivated students prepare for graduate school and leadership in professional careers. This vision is premised upon the understanding that professional employers seek individuals who have attained the essential skills of critical thinking, analytical reasoning and creative problem solving. Texas Wesleyan believes the best way for undergraduate students to learn these skills is in a liberal arts setting through intentionally small classes led by gifted faculty who are committed to student success. This vision also recognizes that most students will need graduate professional degrees to further their careers and that these same skills are required for admission to and successful complet ion of graduate professional programs. The University 25 Realizing that most students will enter the workforce before returning to graduate school, Texas Wesleyan University will maintain graduate professional programs of high quality in formats that are accessible to working adults. These programs will focus on deepening and broadening critical thinking, analytical reasoning and creative problem solving skills in the context of professional content. Accreditation Texas Wesleyan University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to award baccalaureate, master's, and doctoral level degrees.

Milton Kroger Little drove a claim -stake into a barren 50-acre tract of land east of Fort Worth in 1890, even the most visionary supporter of the new college could not have imagined the university that would come into being. From that inauspicious beginning, Texas Wesleyan has successfully taught generations of leaders how to rise to a challenge and get a job done. They did it with class and compassion, an attitude earning the U niversity a Texas- sized reputation that has only grown in recent years. The Poly Years 1891- 1914 When Polytechnic College of the Methodist Episcopal Church South opened its doors in September 1891, it boasted a 25- acre campus, a wooden dorm, an A -frame chapel and a brick classroom building to serve its 105 students and 11 faculty. It was among a growing number of col leges embracing a new way of thinking about education; adding training in commerce and industry to a classic education in the arts and letters, thus \"poly,\" or many. Students would receive practical training in business and professional life that would ser ve as a pipeline to the growing industrial base in Fort Worth, hence \"technic.\" Texas Woman's College 1914- 1935 On May 13, 1914, trustees changed Poly to Texas Woman's College. That September , 317 girls and eight faculty members began classes on a camp us with six buildings. During the 1920s, the tradition of robing, which commemorates the relationship between faculty and students through a ceremonial vesting of cap and gown, became a University tradition. Th e tradition remains to this day and is an exam ple of Texas Wesleyan's dedication to a small, personal educational atmosphere. Faced with dwindling resources during the Depression, trustees voted to close the school in 1931. However, a merger with the financially secure Texas Wesleyan Academy in Austin kept the doors open and created the new, co -educational institution of Texas Wesleyan College in 1934. Texas Wesleyan College 1935- 1989 In the fall of 1934, women returned to campus to find men attending classes. The men increased enrollment by 51 percent. The following March, trustees changed the name one more time, to Texas Wesleyan College, maintaining the initials TWC. The little college would bear the name proudly for 54 years. In addition to strong undergraduate programs, the University added graduate programs in education in the 1970s and nurse anesthesia and graduate business programs in the 1980s. The Council of Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia accredits the Graduate Programs of Nurse Anesthesia. The Master of Science in Nurse Anesthesia is the largest MSNA program in the U.S. Recognizing the growth in programs, trustees changed the name of the institution to Texas Wesleyan University, effective in January 1989. 28 Texas Wesleyan University Texas Wesleyan University 1989- Present Texas Wesleyan has historically combi ned service to a residential population along with its strong commitment to a commuting and adult population. To add flexibility in the scheduling of courses and to recognize the special needs of adult learners, the University added the Weekend/Evening Program in 1994. The University established a campus in downtown Fort Worth in 1997 with the relocation of the Texas Wesleyan University School of Law, which was established in 1992 and fully accredited by the American Bar Association. In 2013, Texas Wesleyan University School of Law was acquired by Texas A&M University. Texas Wesleyan continues to grow in the 21st century. The psychology department moved into its new home, the Nenetta Burton Carter Building in 2001, and a new building for the Graduate Progr ams of Nurse Anesthesia opened in 2003. A graduate program in counseling was added in 2004. In 2005, Texas Wesleyan opened its first apartment- style dormitory for students and completed renovations of the Polytechnic United Methodist Church. In 2007, the E d and Rae Schollmaier Science and Technology Center opened as well as the Louella Baker -Martin Pavilion. In 2008, the historic Baker Building was renovated, and Texas Wesleyan established the Doctorate of Nurse Anesthesia Practice and, in 2009, the Doctor of Education. In 2010, the Claudia Stepp Scene shop opened for use by the theatre department, and the University unveiled the new Jack and Jo Willa Morton Fitness Center. A Doctor of Philosophy in Marriage and Family Therapy was established in 2014. As a part of the 2020 Vision, the University completed the Rosedale Renaissance, the first major revitalization of East Fort Worth in several generatio ns, in 2015. This multi -million -dollar project formed as a partnership with the City of Fort Worth, Tarrant C ounty and the North Central Texas Council of Governments. It created a new front door to the University, renovated the historic Polytechnic Firehouse, created a new Community Counseling Center and revitalized East Rosedale. In addition, the project brought the United Methodist Church Central Texas Conference Service Center and the bishop's offices to the Texas Wesleyan University campus. The Campus Texas Wesleyan University's campus is located in east Fort Worth. The campus includes more than 83 acres four miles southeast of downtown and is located on one of the highest points in the city. The heritage of Texas Wesleyan is reflected in some of the hi storic buildings with Georgian style columns, while progress is seen in the contemporary design of the newer buildings. This mixture of old and new is reflected in all aspects of Texas Wesleyan University's life where new and innovative ideas complement more than a century of traditions.

ROBING AND HOODING CONVOCATION From the time this institution was founded in 1890, a strong bond has united members of the faculty with members of the student body. This close relationship has developed because of the desire of the faculty to teach more than the subject matter and because Texas Wesleyan University students have wanted to learn and understand the beliefs, philosophies, and attitudes of the instructors and professors.

The University, therefore, honors such knowledge by awarding credit for the following CLEP tests, provided that an acceptable score is attained and certain guidelines are followed, when applicable. A list of required scores is available from the Office of Student Records. In addition, CLEP credits that meet Texas Wesleyan University standards will be accepted for transfer students.

A CLEP exam cannot be used to receive credit for any course that is a pre requisite to a course in which the student has already earned college credit. Undergraduate Admission 51 Passing CLEP scores cannot be used to replace any grade, including an \"F,\" that the student has previously earned for a course at Texas Wesleyan University, or at another colleg e or university. CLEP scores will not be included in the grade point average at Texas Wesleyan University, but they will be included in the total required credit hours and on the transcript. International Baccalaureate The International Baccalaureate (IB) program, a demanding pre - university course of study, is recognized for the purposes of admission, where the IB diploma may be presented in lieu of a high school diploma; and where course credit, advanced placement without credit, or a combination of these may be awarded. A minimum grade of 4 is required in the student's area of concentration. An International Baccalaureate student must meet admission requirements as stated above in the appropriate category. Each subject grade is derived from two sources - internal assessment and external assessment. The internal assessment is based on the student's work in her/his studies; the external assessment is based on examination or on a piece of work produced by the student. Exam answers and pieces of work are su bmitted to external IB examiners for grading. The Diploma requires the student to score a minimum of 24 total points, satisfactorily complete the subject courses, the Theory of Knowledge course, the CAS activities, and the Extended Essay. The official IB t ranscript must be submitted upon application to Texas Wesleyan University. A maximum of 30 hours of credit may be awarded with subject credit hours to be determined by individual departments. Prior Learning Experience Students may receive academic credit for learning acquired outside the collegiate classroom, called prior learning experience. Texas Wesleyan recognizes that learning may result from work experience, work -related training, special interests, and travel in addition to enrollment at an academic institution for academic credit; however, credit will be awarded only for college -level learning, not for experience alone. It will not be awarded for vocation al or technical experience, and eligible students must possess a minimum of four years of significant work experience. Two options for seeking academic credit for non- collegiate learning are preparing a portfolio or taking challenge examinations (see below). Additional opportunities for seeking academic credit are through correspondence courses, the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), and educational activities listed in the guides of the American Council on Education or the Military Guide to Servi ce Schools. Thirty (30) hours is the maximum number of academic credit hours allowed when using one or more of these options, and this credit may not be applied to the 45 credit hour residency required for graduation. No more than one -fourth of the requir ed hours for a 52 Texas Wesleyan University major subject may be fulfilled by prior learning experience credit or challenge exams. ( See Graduation Degree Requirements section). Students should possess adequate writing and critical thinking skills that will enable them to develop a po rtfolio of sufficient depth and quality. The dean of the major program in which she/he expects to enroll should be consulted for assistance in identifying and verifying the types of skills and learning to be assessed for college -level credit. Students ma y attempt challenge exams for specific credit with the approval of the Dean of their school. However, these exams may not be available in all areas. Challenge exams may be provided to students who have attained knowledge equivalent to University courses t hrough life experiences and to students who attended schools with limited or no transferability. Exam scores required for credit will be determined by the individual school. Thirty (30) hours is the maximum number of academic credit hours allowed through challenge exams or any other prior learning experience credit. Students may transfer in challenge exams from other 4 -year universities to Texas Wesleyan University. Credit for this exam must be reflected on the student's official University transcript from where the exam was taken. Credit must be approved by the Office of Student Records. Placement Exams ENGLISH PLACEMENT EX AM All students who have not earned college credit for ENG 1301 are required to take the Texas Wesleyan University English Placement Exam. Students who pass the exam will be eligible to enroll in ENG 1301. Students who do not pass the exam must enroll in EN G 0300. Students must demonstrate learned proficiency in ENG 0300 by receiving a grade of \"C\" or better and successfully completing the English Placement Exam before enrolling in ENG 1301. Those that do not receive a satisfactory score on the English Plac ement Exam must enroll in ENG 0301. After successful completion of ENG 0301with a grade of 'C' or better and a satisfactory score on the English Placement Exam, students may enroll in ENG 1301. Students must enroll in ENG 1301 and ENG 1302 within their fir st 30 cumulative hours. Non native speakers of English without a score indicating college readiness on an approved assessment must enroll in Linguistic Diversity Bridge Program courses WRT 0311 and/or WRT 0312 (see page 324 for description and requirement s). Students who present with official TSI Assessment scores may be exempt from taking Wesleyan's placement exam, and the TSI scores may be used to determine appropriate course level placement. Students who transfer in ENG 1301 or score at or above the following thresholds are exempt from the English Placement Exam: a 4 on the AP English exam, a 520 on the SAT Writing section, a Undergraduate Admission 53 550 on the SAT Critical Reading section, or a 28 on the ACT English section. College Board concordance tables are used to compare scores on the redesigned SAT with those that predate it. Students should consult the Coordinator of Academic Placement Testing for test dates and inquiries. MATHEMATICS PLACEMEN T EXAM Students without college algebra or its equivalent prior to initial registration must take the Texas Wesleyan University Mathematics Placement Exam. Placement in MAT 0300, MAT 0301, MAT 1302, or MAT 1304, is determined by performance on the Mathematics Placement Exam. Full time students who have completed 15 hours cumulative must enroll in one of these courses each semester until completion of their general education mathematics requirement. P art time students taking more than one course fall under the requirement after completing 30 semester hours cumulative. Only transfer students with college algebra (or equivalent or higher) are exempt from t he Mathematics Placement Exam. If those students take more math, they are placed into precalculus or higher math course for which they satisfy the prerequisite. Freshman students who have a Math SAT score of 600 or above or Math ACT score of 28 take the Mathematics Placement Exam - Precalculus Form. They are then placed in precalculus or higher based on performance on that exam. If transfer students without an approved Associate of Arts degree or who are not Texas Core Complete do not have college algebra, or a Math SAT score of 600 or above or a Math AC T score of 28, they should follow the same procedure as freshman students. College Board concordance tables are used to compare scores on the redesigned SAT with those that predate it. Students enrolled in MAT 0300 and MAT 0301 must demonstrate learned pr oficiency receiving a \"C\" or better to move to the next level. Students should consult the Coordinator of Academic Placement Testing for test dates and inquiries. READING PLACEMENT EX AM All freshman students wit h an SAT verbal score below 530 or a combined English and Reading A CT score under 46 must take the Texas Wesleyan University Reading Placement Exam.

Financial Aid Recipients - For all students receiving financial assistance, the amount of refund to be released to the student may be adjusted because of revision of aid awarded based on number of hours enrolled. 60 Texas Wesleyan University BOOK VOUCHER POLICY Texas Wesleyan University sends a list of students with credit balances to the Texas Wesleyan/Follett bookstore two weeks prior to the beginning of school for use in the purchase of books and other educational material. A credit balance is an overpayment of charges on the student account that can be attributed to cash payments, student loans, Pell grant, other grants, or other financial aid including institution al aid. The voucher system is open for one week after the beginning of school for a total of three weeks and allows students to charge books to their student account. The maximum allowed for charges is $750. If the student needs more materials, the bookstore contacts the Cashier's Office to get approval for a higher amount. A higher amount will be approved if the student's credit balance will support the charges. If the voucher system is not used, the student automatically declines to participate in the program and no book charges are incurred. Book charges are posted the next day to the student account for the charged amount, reducing the credit available on their account. Any remaining credit balance will be issued to the student in the form of a refund check (see Refund Policy and Regulation 668.164[i]) . REFUND POLICY Beginning refund dates are posted on the Cashier's office website each term. After the first disbursement of Title IV financial aid onto the student account, w ithin 14 days check (or direct deposit) is issued to the student. Refunds not associated with Title IV funds are processed as quickly as possible. For International students with a credit balance, the credit is transferred to the next semester to help pay registration cost. If an international student is not returning and wishes a refund, the student must to go to the Cashier's Office and fill out a request form. Any remaining funds are mailed by check to the student's current United States address. Checks are only mailed to the address on record. Address changes are made in the Office of Student Records. Texas Wesleyan University does not mail checks outside of the U.S. Institutional aid is non -refundable. The student is sent an email to their University email account to notify them of the day the check is available for pickup. Students must present their student ID card to pick up a refund check. Checks are held for pickup for two weeks unless the Cashier's office is notified by email from the student. A fter two weeks, they will be mailed to the address on file. Students will receive an email notification for direct deposits. Refund checks will only be mailed to the current address on record. This address can be verified by the student on Ramlink. Student accounts are subject to change, even after refunds are issued. Expenses 61 Students will be responsible for any balance resulting from an adjustment to their account. ** Update to Refund Policy information Financial Aid Recipients - For all students receiving financial assistance, the amount of refund to be released to the student may be adjusted based on the Federal Refund Calculation and/or State Refund Calculation listed on the next page. Housing \u2014A stude nt who withdraws from residential housing will be eligible for a refund based on the day she/he officially checked out of the room. The refund policy is as follows: Deposit Refund Policy 100% refund before August 1 50% refund from August 1 and first da y to move in 0% refund after first day to move in Contract Refund Policy 100% refund before first day to move in 0% refund after first day to move in This policy does not apply to University Housing off -campus. Any damages will be deducted from the housing deposit, and the balance will be refunded. The student must complete a refund form indicating an address to where a check can be mailed. The request for a deposit refund must be submitted to the housing office within 30 days of checkout or the deposit will be forfeited. If a student fails to check out officially, she/he will be assessed a charge for changing the lock core and replacing the key. Federal Refund Calculation \u2014For students receiving Title IV (federal) financial aid, the Federal Return of Title IV Funds calculation will be performed for all students who withdraw from the University during the first 60 percent of the enrollment period. Any funds that have not bee n \"earned\" during the enrollment period must be returned to the program(s) from which they were awarded. Students may obtain a copy of the full Federal Return of Title IV Funds policy in the Office of Financial Aid. The student will owe the University any funds which are considered to be \"unearned\" by the formula. State Refund Calculation\u2014Students receiving state funds who withdraw from the University will be subject to the state refund policy. This policy is also availabl e from the Office of Financial Aid. 62 Texas Wesleyan University FINANCIAL AID Texas Wesleyan University offers student financial aid through many sources including academic or merit -based scholarships, performance -based scholarships, grants, loans, and campus employment.

Satisfactory Academic Progress Standards Students participating in financial aid programs including scholarships, institutional waivers, grants, loans, and work/study must make satisfactory academic pro gress toward their degrees. Students must satisfactorily complete her/his course of study within the following time frame and maintain the required grade point 68 Texas Wesleyan University average outlined in the Table of Academic Standards. Students must be in \"Good Standing\" to be c onsidered as making satisfactory academic progress. The maximum time frame for which a student may receive financial aid may not exceed 150% of the published length of the academic program of study or have attempted and earned more than 180 hours . Hours for courses with grades of DP, I, T, F, W, and Z are not considered as hours completed in determining satisfactory academic progress. Hours earned during the summer following the academic year may be included for satisfactory academic progress purposes. No more than 186 credits may have been attempted at Texas Wesleyan University. (including transfer hours) As a full -time student, 12 credits hours must be earned each semester (Fall and Spring only) and a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher must be earned in order to maintain SAP. As a part-time student, 6 credits must be earned each semester with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher. Texas Wesleyan University will also review a student's pace towards graduation. Pace, or completion rate, is a measurement of t he number of hours a student has earned divided by the number of hours attempted. This is a cumulative calculation that is completed at the end of each semester and includes both institutional and transfer hours. Undergraduate students must have a pace (co mpletion rate) of at least 67 % (0. 67). Transfer credits count as earned credits and affect the GPA. Transfer credits also count towards the limit of 186 Texas Wesleyan University credits and the pace calculation. A full-time student has a limit of no mor e than 10 semesters; a part-time student of no more than 20 semesters. Only the fall and spring semesters count toward this limit. If a student drops a class anytime in the semester, financial aid will be reduced or cancelled based on the number of hours enrolled. Withdrawal from a course can affect a student's financial aid eligibility since it is counted as an attempted credit that is not earned. This will affect a student's pace calculation. An Incomplete or a Temporary grade does not count as earned credit and will affect eligibility until credit is earned. SAP cannot be assessed until all incomplete grades have been posted. If a student has a grade of incomplete, he /she will not be reviewed for SAP and will not be eligible for financial aid until SAP can be reviewed. Please contact the Office of Financial Aid once a grade has been posted so that SAP can be reviewed again. If a course is repeated and cancelled, eligibility may be affected if total credits earned fall below the minimum required. A pre vious Financial Aid Warning may not be removed by raising a Financ ial Aid 69 prior semester's GPA through the Repeat and Cancel policy, but financial aid eligibility may be reinstated or continued by increasing the cumulative GPA to the minimum required using this policy. Cumulative GPA, pace, and credit hours earned are reviewed at the end of each academic year where a student receives financial aid. If the student is not making SAP, he /she will be notified of a one -semester Financial Aid Warning. During the warning semester, the student must earn 12 credits as a full -time student (or 6 cre dits as a part -time student), 67% pace, and complete the semester with a cumulative GPA of 2.0. If these requirements are not met at the end of the semester, the student will lose his /her financial aid for the next semester (this is known as Financial Aid Suspension). A student can regain their Financial Aid if SAP r equirements (12 credits, 67 % pace, and a 2.0 cumulative GPA) are met at the end of a subsequent semester. A student who does not meet Satisfactory Academic Progress at the end of the Financial Aid Warning period and is thus notified of a Financial Aid Suspension can make a formal written appeal to the Admission and Financial Aid Committee for the reinstatement of Financial Aid for one semester. An appeal can be made in the event of the death of a student's relative, injury or illness of the student, or other special circumstances. The appeal mus t be within 14 days of the suspension letter. No late appeals will be accepted. If an appeal is granted, a student will be put on Financial Aid Probation and will receive financial aid for one semester. A student on Financial Aid Probation must earn 12 c redits and a 2.0 cumulative GPA by the end of the probationary semester or meet other academic standards set by the Admission and Financial Aid Committee (called an Academic Plan) in order to have his /her Financial Aid reinstated. If a student receiving financial aid withdraws after the semester begins, an official withdrawal must be completed. Any student who plans to withdraw must contact the financial aid office. Once a student has notified financial aid of their intent to withdraw, he /she has 48 hours to seek all required signatures to complete the withdrawal process. The date used for the withdrawal will be the date the student initiates (starts) the process. The official withdrawal must be completed in all offices. Federal, state, and institutional a id may be returned and the student may owe a balance with Student Account Services. Prior to returning, the student must pay that balance in full. 70 Texas Wesleyan University The following table outlines the minimum hours that must be completed annually for full -time undergraduate students (12 hours per semester).

With this in mind, we offer two weekly programs: 1) Chapel, a Christian worship se rvice followed by lunch; and 2) Common Meal, an interfaith meal with discussion. Throughout the year, various other spiritual activities and opportunities will be offered to reach out to our community.

Access to Student Records The US Department of Education reiterates that FERPA rights (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) transfer to a student when s/he enters a postsecondary institution. Texas Wesleyan University supports this statement concerning access to individual student academic records and will not provide record access to parents without signature of the student. A specific form (located on the website) is available for this purpose. FERPA does allow institutions to disclose information to appropriate officials in a health or safety emergency, including parents if the emergency involves their child. Texas Wesleyan reserves the right to notify appropriate officials and parents in any situation determined to be an emergency. RECORDS MAINTAINED 1. The University maintains records for each student that may include: name; address; student identification number; contact information for parents, guardian, and/or spouse; 88 Texas Wesleyan University general information on academic status at the University; previous school data; results of standardized admissions, examinations, official transcripts, admissio n applications, acceptance letters and courses previously taken or being taken; credits; and grades. The University Registrar is responsible for maintaining all of these records, except for those involving financial aid, or records pertaining to students i n the Nurse Anesthesia programs which are maintained in that school. These records are available to the University Registrar, the Dean of Students, the President, the Provost and Senior Vice President, the Vice President for Enrollment and Vice President o f Student Services, the Director of Financial Aid, and to the faculty of the University. Staff members affiliated with the University may be designated as having access to the records on a need - to-know basis. The University Registrar, in consultation with the Provost and Senior Vice President, will be the individual charged with responsibility for determining the need to know. Prior consent is not required for the release of educational information under certain circumstances such as the need to know by ot her school officials when a student transfers to another school, when requested by federal/state officials functioning in their official capacity, for financial aid purposes, to certain educational organizations, and in certain emergency situations. 2. Applicants for financial aid have an additional file that contains information submitted as part of the process of applying for financial assistance. Records involving financial aid are maintained by the Director of Financial Aid and are available to the Di rector and staff, the President, the Vice President for Enrollment, the Provost and Senior Vice President, and to the Committee on Scholarships for the purpose of granting and administering the University's financial aid programs. All of these records also are available to such other organizations and persons as are entitled to them under Part 99 of the Code of Federal Regulations. 3. The University complies with the federal record keeping requirements relating to all students to which it issues a Form I -20 Certificate of Eligibility, as listed in the Code of Federal Regulations. 4.

The University maintains a development database that is intended for the use of University employees and volunteers University Policies 89 acting on behalf of the University. The database may include information on students as drawn from the registrar file and may include directory information. The information is not for sale to outside agencies and is released outside the internal campus community when necessary for University business. Research and gift informati on contained in the database is strictly confidential and will only be released outside the Office of Advancement when necessary for University business. 6. The University also maintains for each student a medical record showing history, treatment, etc. These records are maintained at the Student Health Center and, while specifically excluded from Public Law 90- 247, are still available for inspection by the individual student on request. 7. The University also maintains for each student seen by the Counsel ing Center or the Section 504 Coordinator records of those visits and other relevant records in those offices. 8. The University also maintains advising information on each student. Unofficial and informal advising materials may be maintained by individual faculty advisors. SPECIAL RECORDS Student discipline records are maintained by the Dean of Students in that office and are available to the student life staff and disciplinary committee as needed. These records are also available to senior administrative officers or their designees as appropriate. The University will keep a record, available to the student and kept with the personal file, of all persons and organizations, other than those authorized within the University, requesting or obtaining access to the files. This information will indicate specifically the legitimate interest that each person or organization obtaining access has in such records. ACCESS DEFINED 1. Access to student records by University officials is a by - product of the need to know. Such access is delineated in item 1 of this policy; the need for an individual to know information in order to fulfill her/his responsibilities does not allow that individual to share the information with other staff or with individuals extern al to the campus without the permission of the student. 2. Neither student records nor those housed in the Office of Financial Aid nor any personally identifiable information, other than directory information (see #4 above), will be made available to anyone else, other than the student, without written consent. Where consent is required and given, the student, upon request, will receive a copy of the records to be released. 90 Texas Wesleyan University 3. No student can be required or asked to waive rights under Part 99 of the Code of Fe deral Regulations. However, a student may voluntarily waive right of access to confidential statements made by third parties respecting admission to education agencies or institutions, applications for employment, or the receipt of an honor or honorary recognition. In case of waiver, the confidential statements will be used solely for the purposes for which they were specifically intended, and the student will, upon request, be notified of the names of all persons making such confidential statements. 4. Any s tudent who desires to review her/his record may do so by making a written request to the appropriate office immediately responsible for the record. Students may inspect their academic transcripts during normal working hours. The process for specific recor d access and/or copying of the record is summarized here: To see other records, students must provide a written request to the Office of Student Records, the Director of Financial Aid, or the Dean of Students, as appropriate. A mutually convenient time wil l be arranged within 10 working days after receipt of the request for the student to examine the records in the file. At that time, the student may examine all records in the file with the exception of those specifically exempted by Part 99 of the Code of Federal Regulations. All reasonable requests for explanations or interpretations of the records will be honored, and if inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise inappropriate data are found in the records, they will be promptly corrected or deleted. The studen t also has the right to insert into the records a written explanation respecting the contents of such records. APPEALING THE ACCURACY OF THE RECORD 1. If the student and the University Registrar, the Director of Financial Aid, the Dean of Students, or their deputies do not agree on items contained in the records, the student may submit a written request to the Provost and Senior Vice President for a hear ing to challenge the content of the records. The Provost and Senior Vice President will schedule such a hearing within 30 days after receipt of the request and will notify the student reasonably in advance of the hearing of its date, time, and place. The h earing will be before a board composed of the Provost and Senior Vice President or her/his designee, the Vice President for Enrollment and Vice President of Student Services or her/his designee, and at least one disinterested member of the faculty who shal l be appointed by the Provost and Senior Vice President. None of those hearing the challenge may have a direct interest in the outcome. Students will be afforded a full and fair opportunity to present evidence relevant to the issues raised and may be assi sted or represented by individuals of their choice at their own expense, including an attorney. The decision of the board on the correctness of the record, as determined by the majority University Policies 91 vote, will be in writing and will be final. This decision will be base d solely upon the evidence presented at the hearing and will include a summary of the evidence and the reasons for the decision. 2. If, as a result of the hearing, the University decides that the information in the files is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwi se in violation of the privacy or other rights of the student, the University shall amend the records accordingly and so inform the student in writing. However, if, as a result of the hearing, the University decides that the information is not inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the privacy or other rights of the student, it shall inform the student of the right to place in the records a statement commenting on the information in the records and/or setting forth any reasons for disagreeing with the decision of the University. MAINTENANCE OF THE R ECORD The University reserves the right, after a three- year period, to destroy any and all records that it maintains on a student except to the extent that law requires their maintenance for a long er period of time. The Office of Advancement will assist former students of the University in acquiring information related to their own individual record. No inquiries from outside organizations or agencies will be accepted. The Office of Advancement wil l also assist, where possible, former students in getting information about other students. This assistance will occur only after the student inquired about is notified. Administrative Suspension If, in the judgment of the Provost and/or Dean of Students, a student's behavior is disruptive to the educational process and/or a potential danger to a student and/or faculty/staff member and/or other individual in an off -campus Wesleyan educational placement (e.g. internship, practicum, or other), an administrative suspension may result. University officials and/or employees will not release any information regarding the reasons for the administrative suspension other than verifying the status (Right to Privacy Act). An exce ption will be made if the student gives written permission to disclose information regarding the suspension. All disciplinary files and permission letters will be kept in the Dean of Students Office .

The Math Disability accommodation satisfies only the General Education requirement, i.e. PHI 2301 for MAT 1302. Accommodation is not extended to courses that require MAT 1302 as a prerequisite. In the event that additional diagnosed disabilities preclude taking logic, another course will be substituted in consultation with the Dean and the Director.

The University is committed to providing an environment of academic study and employment free from harassment or discrimination to all segments of its community, that is, its faculty, staff, students (current or former), guests and vendors. It is the responsi bility of members of the University community to conduct themselves so that their words or actions cannot be reasonably perceived as harassing, discriminatory, sexually coercive, abusive or exploitive, or as interfering with any other individual's ability to study or work productively at the University. Furthermore, the University strictly forbids retaliation by any member of the University community against anyone who brings a charge of discrimination, sexual harassment or any other form of harassment. Once the University has knowledge of conduct or behavior that could be reasonably construed as harassment or discrimination, action under this policy must be initiated and followed to its conclusion.

Professional responsibility may include, but is not limited to athletics, committee work, University sponsored activities or events, and any other direct educational or University employment related control that gives the faculty or staff member authority or power over the student that could subsequently affect the student's academic or work environment and/or success. These types of relationships are strongly discouraged even when there is no direct relation ship with authority/power that could be exerted over the student. In addition, faculty members may not teach or take any action that may influence the grade of an immediate family member enrolled at the University. Immediate family members are defined as the spouse, significant other, children (natural, adoptive or step) or any dependent person residing with the faculty member. An exception to this policy may be authorized by the dean of the school in question.

PHILOSOPHY OF GENERA L EDUCATION The inclusion of specific general education requirements in all degree plans is an integral part of the overall purpose and philosophy of Texas Wesleyan University. The faculty, administrati on, Board of Trustees, and student body reaffirm the mission of the University to combine for the student the traditional liberal arts with preparation for a professional career in contemporary society. Thus, the curriculum followed by the student unites the general requirements outlined here and the specific offerings of the chosen major in order to provide an effective educational experience for each Texas Wesleyan University graduate. As a private, comprehensive university with a tradition in the libe ral arts stressing small classes and individual attention, Texas Wesleyan is committed to the liberal arts and general education as a means to the overall goal of a complete education for each student. Departments may also recommend specific requirements within the General Education Curriculum for students planning to major in specific programs. The 3+2 Biology B.S. program with the UNTHSC may make additional modifications to the General Education Curriculum. The Bachelor of Science in Health Science 118 Texas Wesleyan University also has a modified General Education Curriculum. Students should refer to the listings of major requirements for details. All students, except transfer students for whom the General Education Curriculum has been waived following the policy below or those transfer students who have completed ENG 1301 or MAT 1302 or higher, are required to take the English and/or Mathematics Pl acement Exams prior to initial registration. All students with a verbal SAT score below 530 (or the ACT equivalent score) or transfer students with fewer than 31 hours must take the Reading Placement Exam. Students should refer to the Placement Exam sectio n listed previously in this catalog for specific information regarding this requirement. College Board concordance tables are used to compare scores on the redesigned SAT with those that predate it. Students who present with official TSI Assessment score s may be exempt from taking Wesleyan's placement exam, and the TSI scores may be used to determine appropriate course level placement. If a student successfully completes the state of Texas 42 semester credit hour baccalaureate core curriculum at any Texas public institution of higher education, that block of courses may be transferred to Texas Wesleyan University and will be substituted for Texas Wesleyan's Gener al Education Curriculum (GEC). For students pursing a Bachelor of Science in Health Science (BSHS) , the General Education Curriculum in the BSHS program will be waived for those with an Associates of A pplied Science in Nursing from a Texas public community college. A student who transfers from a private institution with a core curriculum equivalent to Texas Wesleyan University's core curriculum may be able to transfer that block of courses as determined on a case- by-case basis. All students will still be required to take three hours of an approved religion course (unless already completed) as listed in the General Education Curriculum requirements. A student suspended or dismissed from a previous institution will not receive the waiver of the General Education Curriculum. Students should also note that although exempt from the General Education requirement, they may still be required to take specific prerequisites for required courses. While not part of the General Education Curriculum, ASE 1111, Freshman Seminar, is required for all first semester freshmen and freshman transfer students with 11 or fewer completed credit hours. Students receive elective credit for this course. Students in the Linguistic Diversity Bridge Program are required to take ASE 1311, College Su ccess and American Cultural Experience instead of ASE 1111. ASE 1112, Freshman Seminar Laboratory, is a mandatory course for all freshman students placed on academic probation following their first semester.

A minor can be recommended by a department or it can be declared by a student. A minor shall consist of at least 18 credit hours of course work, 6 of which must be upper division. Requirements for a minor are determined by the school in which the minor is taken and can be found under the schools' listings in this catalog. After completing the requirements of up to two majors and/or two minors, a student falls under the requirements for earning \"an additional baccalaureate degree from Texas Wesleyan University\" (see \"Academic Policies\" section). Students majoring in Liberal Studies or Interdisciplinary Studies cannot declare a minor. Students in social science cannot declare minors in history, political science, or sociology. Students pursuing a B.B.A. cannot declare a minor in business administration. Students in Mass Communication cannot declare a minor in Mass Communication. GRADUATION (DEGREE) REQUIREMENTS To qualify for a baccalaureat e degree (B.A., B.A.A.S., B.B.A., B.M., B.S., B.S.A.T, and B.S.H.S .) from Texas Wesleyan University, a student must complete the following requirements: A minimum of 124 hours and a minimum of 248 grade points for a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on all college work attempted and completed are required for all degrees granted by the Univer sity. A higher number of hours may be required for certain degrees. A minimum of 45 hours or 25% of the credit hours (whichever is greater) of a degree must be earned at Texas Wesleyan. Twenty -four (24) of the 45 hours must be upper division (3000 or 4000 level). A minimum of 15 upper division hours in the major field must be earned at Texas Wesleyan University. A major in a department or school must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0. Certain departments may require a higher grade point average . Specific requirements for a grade point average will be discussed in the content of the major program. A student should consult with her/his major advisor regarding specific requirements for that major. Academic: Programs, Offices, Policies 123 Basic to success in any academic program is skill in written communica tion. The student must exhibit a capability in writing as a requirement of any course. Any instructor in any course may require a student who lacks this skill to seek assistance through the Academic Success Center in the West Library. All University requirements must be completed. Upon receiving a student's graduation application, the Office of Student Rec ords will process and certify a final official degree plan. An application for graduation must be filed in the Office of Student Records during the term prior to completing graduation requirements. November 1 is the application deadline for Spring graduat es. April 1 is the application deadline for Fall graduates. If the application deadline falls on a non- business day, applications will be due the next university business day. Certifying applicants for graduation is a labor intensive process that takes man y months. For this reason, late applications are subject to an additional fee. Extremely late applications submitted within two months of a graduation date pose further challenges and are charged accordingly. No application will be accepted within three weeks of a graduation date without the review and approval of the Office of the Provost. All financial obligations to the University incurred by each graduat ing senior must be met before the degree will be conferred. FOREIGN LANGUAGE REQ UIREMENT The foreign language requirement, if required for the degree, may be satisfied by one of the following options: A stu dent who has a 12 -hour lang uage requirement must obtain credit for 1341, 1342, 2313, and 2314 in sequence in one language, unless otherwise indicated by the degree/major (as listed in this catalog). A student who has a 6 -hour language requirement must obtain credit for 1341 and 1342 in sequence. A stu dent who has satisfactorily com pleted four years of study in one lang uage in high school or pre paratory school may pres - ent this cred it and be ex empted from the require ment, as applicable. A student who achieves a satisfactory score on the College Level Examination Program or a comparable examination may receive either credit hours or advanced placement or both as determined by the department of languages and literature. If a student is proficient in a foreign language to the degree that she/he is elig ible to enroll in the intermediate level, the 6 hours of intermediate foreign language will satisfy the require ment for the Bachelor of Arts degree. A student who presents a diploma from an acceptable high school or degree from an acceptable college or un iversity whose exclusive language of study is a language other than English is eligible to receive 12 hours credit. 124 Texas Wesleyan University PARTICIPATION IN THE GRADUATION CEREMONY/ WALKING GUIDELINES (available for Spring graduation only) Students who have not completed the graduation requirements may petition through the office of their dean to the Provost and Senior Vice President to \"walk\" (participate in commencement ) on the following conditions: Note that this is only available for undergraduates who have applied to graduate in the following Summer term, as Summer graduation does not have an associated commencement ceremony. Be within two courses (6 -8 cred it hours) of completing graduation requirements. Have previously met all 1000/2000 level requirements and all general education courses. Have a cumulative 2.0 GPA and meet any additional GPA requirements as required by the program of study at the time of petition. Demonstrate that there is a plausible non -academic reason beyond the student's control that prevented completion of all requirements. Recognize that this is available for Spring graduation only and not available for December comme ncement . Recognize that the actual graduation date listed on the diploma will be the graduation following the documented completion of all requirements. Note that approved petitioners may be able to participate in both the robing and graduation ceremony a lthough a faculty member may elect not to robe students who have not completed their requirements. Finally, note that students approved to \"walk\" are entitled to a letter from the University Registrar/Provost certifying that they have completed all requir ements once, in fact, final requirements are met. This may occur prior to the actual graduation date entered on the diploma. The petition application is available online on the Provost's web page at 25Twww.txwes.edu/info/office -of-the-provost25T, or in the Office of Student Records. Roles of Academic Offices OFFICE OF THE PROVOS T AND SENIOR VICE PRE SIDENT The Provost and Senior Vice President serves as the chief academic officer at the University. As such, the Provost acts on recommendations from the deans and directors regarding matters of academic policy, student petitions, and other matters affecting the academic lives of the students of the University. Questions concerning issues of academic policy should be directed to the Office of the Provost. Students seeking counsel on specific academic programs or seeking to address issues affecting their program should Academic: Programs, Offices, Policies 125 consult with the dean of the school in which she/he is enrolled. All petitions for readmission to the University or other exceptions to the policies stated in this catalog must be considered by the dean of the school before being submitted to the Of fice of the Provost for final determination. ACADEMIC DEANS Texas Wesleyan University is organized into five academic schools: Arts and Letter s, Business and Professional Programs, Education, Health Professions and Natural and Social Sciences . Each school is headed by the dean of the school who has primary responsibility for implementing academic policies affecting those schools. Students with questions about programs that are not addressed in this catalog should consult with their advisor and/or the dean of the school. Students seeking alternatives to the stated requirements should consult with the dean of the school or her/his designee. All petitions concerning matters of academic policy should be addressed to the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. Concerns regarding the faculty or staff assigned to the respective schools should be addressed to the dean of the school. OFFICE OF STUDENT RE CORDS The purpose of the Office of Student Records is to provide secure, efficient storage of permanent student records and to maintain the integrity of the University catalog. Students rely on the office for a variety of services including registration, schedule changes, verification of enrollment, maintenance of current address information, graduation audit, grades, official transcripts, and official degree audits. Academic Policies ACADEMIC ADVISORS Students with 24 hours o r fewer will be advised by the advisors in the Freshman Advising Center. Once a student has earned 25 hours or more, she/he will be advised by a major or departmental advisor. Advisors w ill assist students in selection of a specific major if they have been accepted with an Undecided program. Students should contact the Office of Student Records at 817- 531-4414, or the Dean's office in their assigned school. ACADEMIC HONOR LIST (DEAN'S LIST ) Students enrolled for 6 or more college -level, academic credit hours during one semester, who have a grade point average of 3.5 or above and no grade lower than \"C\" during the semester, will be placed on the Academic Honor List (Dean's List). This honor is determined at the end of spring and fall semesters. ACADEMIC HONORS Academic honors are awarded for work performed by the student during her/his entire college career. Students must complete a 126 Texas Wesleyan University minimum of 45 hours at Texas Wesleyan University to be eligible for honors at graduation. Students who have a cumulative grade point average of 3.85- 4.0 receive the designation summa cum laude. Students who have a cumulative grade p oint a verage of 3.7- 3.84 receive the designation magna cum laude. Students who have a cumulative grade point average of 3.5 -3.69 receive the designation cum laude. Grade point averages transferred from other colleges will be averaged with grade points earned at Texas Wesleyan in determining the honors. Students who have graduated with an associate's degree from a community college are eligible to graduate from Texas Wesleyan with honors as prescribed above. ACADEMIC STANDARDS Academi c standards are designed to provide close supervision of the program of study and academic progress of a student. Academic standing is based upon a student's Texas Wesleyan University cumulative grade point average (see definition above) and all course work attempted at Texas Wesleyan University and other colleges or universities. Good Academic Standing A student will be classified as in good academic standing when she/he maintains a cumulative academic grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or higher on all semester hours attempted. Academic Probation /Suspension If, at the end of a semester, a student's cumulative grade point average for the total number of hours attempted falls below 2.0, the student will be placed on academic probation for the following semester and \"Academic Probation\" will be recorded on her/h is transcript. Students may continue on academic probation for a period of two consecutive long semesters. Students who have been placed on academic probation for two consecutive long semesters and do not raise the academic average to good standing by the end of the third semester will then be placed on academic suspension for the next long semester. If a student is suspended at the end of spring semester, the suspension will include the summer session(s) and the following fall semester. The student will be informed by letter of her/his academic status. \"Academic Suspension\" will be recorded on the student's transcript and will remain as a permanent entry. Part -time Students \u2014A student currently attending part -time whose grade point average indicates probation may continue on probation as long as reasonable progress of a 2.5 or higher grade point is achieved each semester until the cumulative grade point is raised to 2.0 or hi gher and the student can be removed from probationary status. Academic: Programs, Offices, Policies 127 Restricted Enrollment \u2014As an alternative to remaining out one long semester, a student may elect to remain in school with restricted enrollment status. This status means that the student may on ly repeat courses in order to improve her/his cumulative grade point to return to good standing. Restricted enrollment is the only alternative available to students who face suspension. Once a student has selected restricted enrollment in lieu of suspension, her/his proposed schedule must be approved by the student's academic advisor and approved by the student's dean. The dean must notify the University Registrar that the student has selected restricted enrollment. If a student chooses restricted enrol lment status and does not earn sufficient grade points during the next semester to raise the academic average to good standing, the student will be placed on one year of academic suspension . Students on restricted enrollment may drop courses only with the approval of their academic dean. Students requesting to drop a course required under restricted enrollment may be required to withdraw from school. Any academic credit earned during the period of academic suspension will not be accepted or counted towar d a degree from Texas Wesleyan University. Readmission After Academic Suspension \u2014A student seeking readmission after a period of academic suspension m ust see her/his academic advisor and the dean of the schoo l. The academic advisor and the Dean of the school will send to the Provost a written recommendation regarding the readmission of the student. If readmitted, the student will be on aca demic probation and expected to satisfy the requirements for continued enrollment at the end of the semester. It is strongly recommended that a student enrolling after an academic suspension repeat courses in which the grades of \"D\" or \"F\" were awarded. First Academic Suspension \u2014A student placed on academic suspension at the end of the fall semester is eligible to apply for readmission to the following summer session. A student placed on academic suspension at the end of the spring semester is eligible to apply for readmission to the following spring semester. Second Academic Suspension\u2014A student placed on academic suspension the second time must reapply for admission through the Office of Admission after 12 months . Third Academic Suspension \u2014A student placed on academic suspension a third time must have the approval of the Admissions Committee before being readmitted . Normally a minimum of 24 months must pass before the committee will review an application for readmission. Admission of Students on Acade mic Suspension from Other Universities \u2014A student suspended from another university who transfers to Texas Wesleyan University must have served the suspension according to Texas Wesleyan University guidelines or 128 Texas Wesleyan University show documentation for eligibility to return to the suspending institution prior to enrollment. Coursework taken during suspension is not transferable to Texas Wesleyan University. CATALOG A student will normally complete requirements for a degree within the maximum 10 calendar years from the date of initial enrollment at Texas Wesleyan University. A student who has not been in continuous enrollment at Texas Wesleyan University and who re - enrolls after the 10 -year maximum time period has elapsed will complete requirements for a degree under the catalog that is current on the date of re -enrollment. A student who re -enrolls within the 10 - year period should continue with their original catalog unless it is more advantageous to enroll under a more recent one. E xemptions must be approved by the dean of the school. Individual programs may have additional time limitation s. Students may elect to move to a more recent catalog to complete their degree. All program requirements in the most recent catalog must be completed. A Catalog Year Change Request Form must be completed and retained in the student's academic file. CLASSIF ICATION OF STUDENTS The number of hours successfully completed by the student will determine the academic classification: Freshman 0-30 hours Junior 61-90 hours Sophomore 31-60 hours Senior 91 hours and above COURSES Auditing Any course may be audited with approval of the instructor. On the first day of class, permission should be obtained from the instructor and the completed audit form submitted to the Offi ce of Student Records. The student will be registered as an audit student and must pay an audit fee. \"AU\" will appear on the transcript in lieu of a grade. A student may not change from audit to credit or credit status to audit after the conclusion of the initial add/drop period. Registration (Add/Drop ) After registration has been completed, a student may change her/his schedule only during the add/drop period. During the first week of classes, courses may be added or dropped with the permission of the major advisor using the Student Registration form. No course may be added after the first week of classes. After the first week of classes, courses may be dropped until the \"last day to drop\" date as designated in the Academic Calendar, although only with permission from both the course instructor as well as major advisor on the Student Registration form. A \"DP\" will Academic: Programs, Offices, Policies 129 be designated on the student's transcript for any courses dropped during the drop period. After the last day to drop, students may still withdraw from courses; however, a grade must be assign ed by the professor. If a student withdraws after the last day to drop a course, a grade of \"F\" will be reflected on the student's transcript. Class Attendance Regular and punctual attendance at all scheduled c lasses is expected of all students. University regulations authorize certain absences of students when representing the University (e.g. participation in intercollegiate athletic competitions, and student government, student development, or fine arts event s). Absences that may be necessary to fulfill course requirements and are approved by the Provost are also considered to be authorized. The maximum number of authorized absences during one semester is five for a Monday -Wednesday - Friday class, three for a Tuesday -Thursday class, and two for a class or laboratory meeting once a week. Additional authorized absences may be granted on an individual basis when extreme circumstances warrant (e.g. advancement to and representation of the university at regional or national level intercollegiate athletic, academic, or fine arts competition). Individual faculty may not enforce a more restrictive policy than what is set by the University. Students are required to notify instructors prior to any missed class and will be held responsible for all class and laboratory assignments. Class attendance is vital for student success in the Evening and Weekend Classes, since many classes meet once each week or every other weekend. A student who is absent from class must contact t he instructor before the absence, if possible. Class absences jeopardize a student's academic success and grade. Each instructor of Evening and Weekend Classes determines the specific attendance policies for the class. Attendance via participation is critical to a student's success in Online and Hybrid Classes . When an online or hybrid class student does not participate in consecutive online activities or does not submit consecutive assignments AND has not communicated with the instructor about the student's participation, the instructor must drop the student from the class using the Faculty Initiated Student Withdrawal process. Each instructor determine s the specific number of consecutive activities or assignments that will initiate the withdrawal, according to the requirements of the particular online or hybrid class . Inclement Weather Make- Up Classes Classes cancelled because of inclement weather (see \"Inclement Weather University Closing\" section listed previously in this catalog) may necessitate scheduling additional class days. These make-up days will be announced through appropriate campus publications and to the faculty and staff within two weeks after the classes have been cancelled. 130 Texas Wesleyan University Class Load The normal undergraduate class load is 15 credit hours. Twelve credit hours is the minimum class load for classification as a full-time student during the fall or spring semester. Undergraduate students enrolled in fewer than 12 hours are considered part -time students. Eighteen (18) hours is the maximum class load for which a student may register during the fall or spring semester without special permission. Students with a grade point average of 3.0 or better for the previous semester and with an acceptable cumulative grade point average may regi ster for 19 or more hours with the written permission of the dean of the student's school . Permission must be secured in advance of and presented during registration (see Overload policy). In a summer session, 7 hours per term is the maximum class load fo r which a student may register . A student may not register for more than 14 hours total during the summer sessions without the written permission of the dean of the student's school. The number of hours in which a student enrolls should be carefully consi dered in consultation with her/his advisor. As a general rule, a full-time class load of 15 hours is a commitment to a 40 -hour week of attendance and out -of-class preparation/assignments. Concurrent Enrollment Texas Wesleyan University students who wish to enroll at another institution (concurrent enrollment) must have the written approval of the dean of their school before enrolling at another institution. When students request approval for concurrent enrollment, they must make certain to meet the required 45 hours in residency and any other residency requirements at Texas Wesleyan University. They must also make certain the selected course(s) will be accepted as transfer credit at Texas Wesleyan University. Permission forms for concurrent enrollment must be presented to the Office of Student Records for confirmation that the requested course(s) fulfills graduation requirements. Conference Course A conference course is a course taught by an instructor to an individual student. A student may enroll for a conference course only by approval of the instructor of the course, the dean of the school in which the conference course is o ffered, and the University Registrar. Approval is normally given only when the following requirements are met: (1) a confer ence course may be taken only in the last regular semester or summer term before the graduation of the student; (2) the course reque sted must be required for graduation; (3) the course is not scheduled to be taught that semester or term; (4) there is a conflict in schedule between two required courses during the last semester or term before graduati on; and (5) the student must be enrolled in one or more regular courses in the University. At the dean's discretion, exemptions may be made to approval criteria due to extenuating Academic: Programs, Offices, Policies 131 circumstances. An additional fee, dependent upon the number of credit hours, is charged for conference courses. Course Credit Academic credit assigned to a subject is expressed in semester hours. The second digit in the course number indicates the credit -hour value of each course. The number of hours a class meets each week is the same as the credit -hour value of the course, with some exceptions, such as laboratory- type courses. For a more complete description of course credit hour s, see page 292 of the catalog. Course Descriptions All courses offered by the University are listed in the back of this catalog. Course Substitution or Waiver When a student seeks approval for a change in the major requirements from the requirements stated in th e catalog, a substitution or waiver form must be completed. The student, the student's advisor, and the dean must sign this form before it is forwarded to the Office of Student Records for acceptance. Final approval of the substitution or waiver will be ma de by the Registrar in conjunction with the appropriate dean. The form will be included in the student's permanent file. If the course substitution or waiver involves a General Education Curriculum degree requirement, the dean in whose school the requirement resides is responsible for approving the request. If the substitution or waiver does not involve a General Education Curriculum requirement, the dean in whose department/school the student's major resides is responsible for approval. Independent Study An independent study course covers subject matter that is n ot currently offered in the university catalog but is of special interest to the student. These courses of independent study or supervised research may be offered for 1 to 4 hours of credit at the junior (3000) level and above. The third and fourth digits in the number listing for these courses will be 50. Approval of the proposed study by the dean of the school, the chairperson of the department, and the instructor who will supervise the study is required prior to registration. A syllabus must be acknowled ged by both the instructor and student and a copy kept on file in the dean's office. A maximum of 9 hours of directed study and supervised research will be accepted for the graduation requirement. Joint Undergraduate/Graduate Enrollment Students with senior standing may register for up to six hours of graduate credit (see 5000 or above series courses in the Graduate Catalog) with the consent of the dean of their school and the dean of the school in whose program the courses reside/Director of 132 Texas Wesleyan University GPNA and the course instructor. Graduate courses applied towards an undergraduate degree may not be applied towards a graduate degree. Certain courses are cross listed in the same discipline on the undergraduate and graduate levels. If a student completes a cross listed course as an undergraduate, the student cannot later take the same course for graduate credit. Overload Any undergraduate student wishing to enroll in 19 cr edit hours or more during spring or fall semester or 8 hours or more in a summer term must obtain a recommendation of her/his advisor and approval of the dean. Students with a grade point average of 3.0 or better for the previous semester, and with an acceptable cumulative grade point average may request permission to register for an overload using the \"Request for Overload\" form, available in the Office of Student Records and from deans' offices. Approval must be secured in advance of and presented during registration. Repeating Courses Any course taken at Texas Wesleyan University and repeated for a grade must be repeated at Texas Wesleyan University. Any course taken at another institution may be repeated at Texas Wesleyan, and the most recent grade on the course will be counted. When a course is repeated, the grade point average will be computed using the most recent grade achieved. Undergraduate/Graduate Cross -listed Courses Certain courses are cross -listed in the same discipline on the undergraduate and graduate levels. If a student completes a cross- listed course as an undergraduate, the student cannot later take the same course for graduate credit. WITHDRAWALS/DROPS Faculty Initiated Student Withdrawal from a Course. Unauthorized absences may be excused when caused by illness or other emergencies and should be reported promptly to the instructor. When a student has a number of unauthorized absences equal to the number of days the class meets per week AND has not communicated with the instructor about the absences within 10 calendar days, the instructor must either drop the student from the class or give a grade of incomplete (I) as appropriate. For evening, weekend, hybrid or online classes, e ach instructor determines the specific number of consecutive activities or assignments that will initiate the withdrawal, according to the requirements of the particular class. The instructor must drop the student from the class using the Faculty Initiated Student Withdrawal process. The Registrar will record a grade of \"DP\" for the course on the student's transcript. The Registrar will record a grade of \"WF\" (failure) on the student's transcript if the instructor drops the stude nt after the date for receiving a grade of \"DP\" as specified in the University catalog. Academic: Programs, Offices, Policies 133 Instructors who give a student a grade of incomplete (I) must follow the grading policies set forth in the University Catalog. Any student who successfully completes al l outstanding assignments by the prescribed date specified in the Academic Calendar will have the incomplete grade replaced with a grade as determined by the instructor. Any student who does not complete the outstanding assignments by the prescribed date shall have the incomplete grade replaced with a grade of \"F\". A student who has been absent from any regular examination and has satisfied the instructor that the absence was due to serious illness or other unavoidable cause may take a special examination at the discretion of the instructor concerned. Withdrawal from the University : A student wishing to withdraw from all classes must formally withdraw from the University by completing the withdrawal form available in the Office of Student Records. The Director of Financial Aid, Cashier, and the University Registrar must sign this form . For the withdrawal to be complete, the form must be returned to the Office of Student Records along with the student's identification card. A student who withdraws from the University after the last day to drop a course as specified in the University Academic Calendar or who withdraws without following the official procedure will be given the grade of \"F\" in all courses. A student who withdraws from the University is still obligated to pay the tuition and fees incurred at the time of registration. A student may be dropped from the University when her/his instructors and the dean of her/his school determine that the student is not achieving passing grades in the academic work or for other sufficient causes, including but not limited to poor class attendance, failing to meet program or University ethical, integrity, or other standards. DEGREE AUDIT /PLAN The degree audit is a listing of a student's current program requirements showing what requirements a student has and has not completed. Degree audit s should be used by a student and her/his advisor to track the student's academic progress. Freshmen or students with no previous college credit should obtain her/his degree audit from the web ( www.txwes.edu /registrar ) prior to completing 60 hours and meet with her/his advisor to maintain accuracy. Transfer students are encouraged to obtain their degree audit from the web once all transfer credit has been posted. Students are expected to work with their advisor and kee p the degree audit current and accurate. At the time a student has completed 9 0 hours, an official degree audit will be processed and reviewed by the Office of Student Records and issued to the student and advisor. Upon receiving a student's graduation application, a final official degree audit will be processed and certified by the Office of Student Records. Official 134 Texas Wesleyan University degree audits may only be certified by the Office of Student Records. GRADING A grade is assigned f or each course in which a student is regularly enrolled. A passing grade may be earned only if the student is enrolled for the duration of the course. The following grades are used by Texas Wesleyan University: Grade Description Grade Points A Excellent 4.0 B Above average 3.0 C Average 2.0 D Below average 1.0 F Failing 0.0 P Passing * WF Withdrawal Failing 0.0 * Not counted in calculating grade point average (GPA) The following may appear on the transcript in lieu of a grade but are not included in the GPA calculation: AU Audit * CIP Course in Progress * CR Credit * DP Dropped * I Incomplete * NR No Grade Reported * T Temporary * W Withdrawal * * Not counted in calculating grade point average (GPA ) The grade \"I\" (incomplete ) is given only when the student's work is satisfactory but, for reasons beyond the control of the student, has not been completed. Both students and instructors should note that an \"I\" is not given in lieu of an \"F\" (failing). It is the responsibility of the student to confer with the instructor of the course and to complete the prescribed requirements of the course by the designated date shown in the University Academic Calendar. For each \"I\" assigned, the instructor will file an Incomplete Grade Form with the Office of Student Records. On or before the designated date, the instructor will assign a grade and report it to the Office of Student Records. If a new grade is not reported by the designated date, the \"I\" will automatically convert to an \"F.\" Once an \"F\" is given, it cannot be changed without repeating the course in which it was given. No grade changes may be made after one (1) year from the time the grade was original ly issued. This limit also applies to grades issued following completion of an \"incomplete\" (I) grade. The grade \"T\" is a temporary grade assigned if a course extends beyond the regular semester dates. This grade is not used in lieu of an \"I\" but is given to students who are enrolled in courses in which Academic: Programs, Offices, Policies 135 grades will not be available until after the regular semester ends. Examples of such courses are Weekend U niversity summer courses, EDU 21 00, NSC 1410, and certain courses taken abroad. It is possible for a student to take a maximum of five elective courses (15 hours) toward a degree in which she/he may choose to be graded on a \"P/F\" basis. Courses in which the grades of \"P\" or \"F\" are regularly awarded to all students enrolled do not count among these five courses. Students may not choose to receive a grade of \"P\" or \"F\" in any course that is a general education curriculum requirement or a specific departmental requirement for a major, a minor, or a certificate. A student may enroll in only one of these five elective courses in any given semester and must have written permission prior to enrolling from her/his major advisor, the instructor, and the dean of the student's major. A factor in determining a student's grade in any course will be competency in the use of written and spoken English. Grade Point Average Grade points are used in calculating the grade point averages (GPA) required for admission, graduation, and other scholastic requirements. Grade Point Averages are calculated by dividing the total number of grade points by the total number of attempted credit hours. Grade points are based on A=4, B=3, or \"T\" have no grade points and are not used in GPA calculation. When a course is repeated, the grade point average will be calculated using the most recent grade achieved . Grade point averages are calculated at the end of each semester and at the end of each summer term. For courses taken at another institution and repeated at the other institution prior to enrolling at Texas Wesleyan University, the last grade awarded f or the course will be shown on the Wesleyan transcript . Major Grade Point Average The calculation of a student's major GPA is based only on those courses that are specific to the major and are required beyond the General Education Curriculum. These courses are listed under the degree requirements for each major and are labeled \"Major Requirements.\" Grade Appeal Process 1. Students wishing to appeal a grade must do so in a timely fashion. For grades assigned during a semester and which are incorporated into the final grade, the appeal must be initiated before the completion of the semester. For course grades or grades on assignments completed within the last week of the semester, the appeal must be initiated before the end of the following semester. For appeals of grades assigned in the fall semester, a studen t has until the end of the following spring semester; for grades assigned in the 136 Texas Wesleyan University spring, the student has until the end of the following fall semester; for grades assigned during the summer, the student has until the end of the following fall semester. No grade may be appealed after one (1) year. 2. If a student decides to appeal a grade, the student contacts the instructor for discussing the grade assignment. This contact establishes an appeal. The student and instructor may interact face- to-face, by video c onference, by telephone, or by email. If an instructor is not available because of part -time, sabbatical, or other circumstances, the student may begin with step (3). Under extremely unusual circumstances, grades may be appealed beyond these deadlines. Students should realize that pertinent documentation (e.g. other students' papers) becomes less readily available as time passes. 3. If the results of the discussions with the instructor are unsatisfactory, the student contacts the department chair or directo r. 4. The student will provide the department chair or director with a written complaint (a) stating what grade is being appealed and, (b) on what basis it is being appealed. The student should also provide all pertinent materials such as ; the assignment for which the grade is being appealed, the syllabus for the course, previous grades assigned in the course, etc. 5. The department chair or director * will review the materials and the appeal with the student with the thought of ascertaining the issues involved in the appeal. Additional information may be requested from the student and/or the instructor. The department chair or director will attempt to resolve the appeal informally between the student and the instructor. 6. If the appeal cannot be resolved informally, the department chair or director will meet with the dean to discuss the issues involved and to transmit the documentation developed to that point. The dean will then contact the student and the instructor to discuss the appeal. The dean will have the responsibility to determine the merits of the appeal. The dean may request assignments submitted by other students, a review or re- grading of the assignment, and a review of the grade(s) by qualified individuals or other faculty, and/or request other materials as necessary to support a decision. The decision to obtain more information or to refer the case to others is that of the dean. 7. The dean will make a written recommendation to the Provost to approve or deny the grade appeal. 8. If the grade appeal is denied, the student may appeal to the Provost as the chief academic officer. The Provost has the responsibility to review the procedures followed in the Academic: Programs, Offices, Policies 137 review process in order to determine if due process was followed. 9. If the grade appe al is approved, the instructor may appeal to the Committee on Faculty Grievances. *If there is no department chair or director , the appeal discussions occur with the associate dean or dean and steps (4) and (5) are carried out by the dean. If the grade a ppeal concerns the department chair or director , the contact is made directly with the dean. If the grade appeal concerns the dean, the contact is made with the Provost. If the grade appeal concerns the Provost, the contact is made with the President. PETITIONS All petitions concerning matters of academic policy should be addressed to the dean of the school in which the student is enrolled. All petitions for exceptions to the policies stated in this catalog must be considered by the dean of the school before being submitted to the Office of Student Records. PROGRAM (M AJOR/MINOR) Declaration or Change of Major/Minor All students must declare a specific major by the time 45 hours have been completed. A major or minor may be changed and a second major or minor declared by notifying the Office of Student Records. Multiple Majors/Minors Except as noted below, s tudents may major in more than one subject area. All degree requirements must be met for each major that is declared. If a student selects one major, two minors may also be earned. However, if a student selects two majors, no minors may be selected. The student will be assigned an advisor in each subject area. After completing the requir ements for up to two majors or one major and two minors, a student falls under the requirements for earning \"an additional baccalaureate degree from Texas Wesleyan University.\" To earn an additional baccalaureate degree from Texas Wesleyan University in another major, a student must complete an additional 30 hours in residency, 15 hours of which must be advanced hours (3000 or above). The student must fulfill the requirements of that major, including both major and required related requirement , with a minimum of 15 hours in that major. Students declaring Liberal Studies or Interdisciplinary Studies as their major may not have a second major or a minor. These majors were designed particularly for working professionals seeking to broaden their skills and enhance their opportunity for advancement. 138 Texas Wesleyan University Second Baccalaureate Degree A student who has earned a baccalaureate degree from another accredited institution , and who seeks a baccalaureate degree in another major from Texas Wesleyan University , must complete a minimum of 45 hours at Texas Wesleyan University. The student must meet the requirements of the major, includ ing both major and required related requirements. At least 15 hours of the additional 45 hours must be advanced hours (3000 or above) in the major and the remaining hours in courses unique to the Texas Wesleyan University General Education Curriculum inclu ding a religion course . The appropriate school will analyze transcripts and specify which general education courses must be completed. A student who has earned a baccalaureate degree from Texas Wesleyan University , and who wishes to earn an additional bacc alaureate degree from Texas Wesleyan University in another major , must complete a minimum of 30 additional hours in residency, 15 hours of which must be upper division (3000 or above) level, and fulfill the requirements of the major with a minimum of 15 hours in that major. A student may not receive two Bach elor of Business Administration degrees as this program of study only provides the option of pursuing a second major . A student who has completed a B.S.H.S., B.A.A.S. or similar degree at Texas Wesleyan or elsewhere and who wishes to pursue a baccalaureate degree in another major may need to complete additional hours as determined by the appropriate school. SCHOOL MANUALS/HANDBO OKS Schools and/or departments may publish manuals or handbooks outlining specific program requirements to supplement the University Undergraduate Catalog. Students are expected to follow these policies, as related to their chosen major. Manuals may be obtained from students' major departments or schools. TRANSCRIPT REQUEST Students can order official transcripts through the online transcript service at www.txwes.edu/academics/registrar/transcripts . Students may also complete a request in the Office of Student Records. The transcript fee is $5 per electronic copy and $7 per paper copy. Allow 3-5 business days for processing. Allow additional time for process ing if ordering transcripts during registration periods or graduation preparation. Realizing that emergencies occur, a student may receive expedited processing and mailing. There is an additional fee of $30 for this service TRANSIENT CREDIT A student who is attending another university either concurrently or during the summer should complete the \"Request for Enr ollment at Another University\" form. For requirements and restrictions, refer to the \"Concurrent Enrollment\" and \"Graduation Requirements\" section listed previously in this catalog. Special Academic Programs 139 SPECIAL ACADEMIC PRO GRAMS Academic Success Experience To assist new freshmen in becoming familiar with Texas Wesleyan University and to be more successful in their academics, Texas Wesleyan University has designed an Academic Success Experience (ASE). ASE 1111 Freshman Seminar is the first course in this program and is required for all first semester freshmen and freshman transfer students with 11 or fewer completed credit hours. This course is designed to address issues related to the successful transition from high school to the University. Campus orientation, college level study skills, and other transitional issues are covered. A student may not drop ASE 1111. If a student fails to achieve a passing grade in ASE 1111, the student will be required to retake the course the following semester until a passing grade is achieved. ASE 1112 Freshman Seminar Laboratory is a mandatory course for all freshman students placed on academic probation following their first semester. This class explores the various causes of academic probation and addresses strategies to regain adequate academic standing. Failure to enroll in ASE 1112 as required may result in administrative withdrawal from the University. A student may not drop ASE 1112. If a student fails to achieve a passing grade in ASE 1112, t he student will be required to retake the course the following semester until a passing grade is achieved. ASE 1113 Ram Rebound is a course required of any non- freshman student placed on academic probation. (Freshmen may enroll in ASE 1113 in lieu of 1112 with permission of the instructor .) This course will address the various barriers to academic success, explore individual goals, strengths, and personal issues, as well as promote the development of time management strategies, study sk ills, critical thinking, and problem -solving abilities related to academic performance. A student may not drop ASE 1113. Failure to enroll in ASE 1113 as required may result in administrative withdrawal from the University. ASE 1311 The College Success an d American Cultural Experience is a mandatory course for non native speakers of English placed into the Linguistic Diversity Student Bridge Program and is taken in place of ASE 1111. A student may not drop ASE 1311. This course is designed to address issues related to the successful transition to the American system of higher education. Campus orientation, college level study skills, and other transitional issues are covered, with expanded content related to American higher education and culture including U.S. classroom expectations. ASE 2111 Transfer Success Experi ence is a course designed for new transfer students. It is a one -hour elective course designed to assist new transfer students as they transition to the Wesleyan camp us. The course addresses such issues as Wesleyan's policies and procedures, available resources on campus, charting the course for graduation, academic integrity, and other helpful information. 140 Texas Wesleyan University Developmental Program The purpo se of the Texas Wesleyan Developmental Program is to provide an opportunity for students with assessed deficiencies in reading, mathematics, or writing to receive appropriate developmental education in order to perform satisfactorily in college- level cours ework. Freshmen who do not meet required scores on the reading, mathematics, and English placement exams must enroll in the appropriate developmental courses. Transfer students who have not completed the s tate of Texas Core Curriculum or the freshman English and/or mathematics course requirements also are required to complete the appropriate placement exams before enrollment in English or mathematics courses. The developm ental courses do count towards f inancial aid purposes , but they do not count towards hours needed for graduation. Developmental courses are calculated in a student's overall GPA. Students may not drop developmental courses and remain in college level courses without approval of the Director of Developmental Programs . The following developmental/bridge courses are offered: ENG 0300 Composition and Grammar I RDG 0301 Reading Techniques I 0300 Beginning Algebra MAT 0301 Intermediate Algebra WRT 0311 Writing I for non native speakers WRT 0312 Writing II for non native speakers RDG 0311 Reading I for non native speakers RDG 0312 Reading II for non native speakers Distance Education Texas Wesleyan University is dedicated to cultivating critical thinking, analytical reasoning, and creative problem solving in its students to prepare them for careers, professional programs, and graduate schools. Texas Wesleyan University also strives to maintain undergraduate and graduate programs that are accessible to worki ng adults. Distance education is central to these aspects of Texas Wesleyan's mission. In providing a high quality education to a diverse community of learners, we are also able to serve the higher education and professional needs of businesses, public sch ools, and the community as well as enable students to utilize current technologies for professional development. Through distance education, on- campus and off -campus learners can access course related materials, resources, and communication via synchronou s (live interactive) or asynchronous (anytime -anywhere) delivery methods using videoconferencing and/or online Internet based services. Students who are enrolled in online courses have access to the same campus resources made available to on -campus student s. These resources include admissions, counseling and health Special Academic Programs 141 services, the West library, student services, career services and recreational facilities. The University offers courses by distance education in the following disciplines: Business Natural Science Education Psychology Health Sciences Religion and Humanities Languages and Literature Social Science ONLINE DEGREE IN COM PARATIVE RELIGIOUS S TUDIES In addition to online coursework in the academic areas listed above, Texas Wesleyan University additionally offers a program in Comparative Religious Studies that can be completed online, following com pletion of the General Education Curriculum. In this program, students engage in an in- depth study of varied religious and social cultures and communities from around the globe, and their relationships to one another. The program is ideally suited to students interested in global culture, international studies and individual global religious systems. More information can be found regarding the program under the Department of Religion and Humanities and at the Texas Wesleyan University website. Evening and Weekend Classes There is an array of undergraduate and graduate courses from various disciplines that may be found within the class schedule on nights and weekends . Most students take a combi nation of weekend, evening, and online courses to expedite degree completion. We offer various graduate degrees that may be completed during night and weekend or online . These programs include: Master of Education, M.Ed. Doctor of Education, Ed.D. Master of Arts in Professional Counseling, M.A.Prof.Couns. Master of Science in School Counseling, M.S.Sch.Couns. Master of Science in Marriage & Family Therapy, M.S.M.F.T. Doctor of Philosophy in Marriage and Family Therapy, Ph.D. M.F.T. SCHEDULING OF COURSE S Weekend classes may be scheduled on Track A, B, or C. Track A and B courses meet on alternate weekends, seven times per semester in four-hour sessions. Track C courses meet every weekend for two and one-half hour sessions. Track A and B meeting times are 8:00 a.m . - 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m . - 5:00 p.m. unless otherwise indicated in the schedule. Track C meeting times may vary but are usually scheduled from 8:00 a.m . - 10:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m . - 1:00 p.m., 8:00 a.m . - 12:00 p.m., or 1:00 p.m . - 3:30 p.m. 142 Texas Wesleyan University Most evening courses meet once per week for two and one -half hour sessions per week. Several evening courses meet twice weekly and these session times vary. Evening courses are considered those beginning at 4:30 p.m. or later. Weekend and evening courses cover the same content as traditional courses but are organized in a time -intensive arrangement requiring self-direction and pacing by each student. Since these classes meet fewer times per week than most day classes, attendance is critical to the student's success. Instructors may require assignments due the first time class meets. For more information, check the website for syllabi at http://txwes.edu/academics/weekend -and-evening - programs/ . The M.D. Anderson Pre -Professional Program This unique Texas We sleyan University program provides the initial preparation for those students who aspire to attend professional schools in pursuit of a career in the helping professions by: Developing an understanding of the nature of professional practice; Stimulating awareness of professional ethical and civic responsibilities; Promoting inter -professional understanding and cooperation. The students in this program receive educational and career information about medical, dental, legal, ministerial, clinical and professional counseling as well as other helping professional programs requiring licensure. Specific activities that further the mission of the program include the following: Biweekly luncheons featuring university and community professionals who offer firsthand knowledge about the challenges and rewards of the helping professions; Student -led societies providing opportunities to intermingle with fellow students who have similar professional goals as well as developing leadership skills and attributes; Specialized faculty advising for all pre- professional students; Mentoring opportunities to interact with local professionals; 3PR classes and seminars that address interpersonal skills, the admission process, practice admissions tests, and the interview pr ocess; and 3PR courses that expand skills in public speaking, argumentation, and analysis of ethical decision- making.

PROGRAM ADVANTAGES All pre -medical and pre -dental students benefit from the on- campus Health Professional Advisory Committee (HPAC) which interviews the student on behalf of the medical or dental schools, sending a letter of recommendation to the schools to which the student applies. Texas Wesleyan is a particip ant in the Dental Early Admission Program (DEAP) offered by the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio; applications to the program are coordinated by the 3PR office. Because of the suggested minimum 3.25 GPA for 3PR enrollment, active participants are eligible for undergraduate scholarships, including the Hatton W. Sumners Foundation as well as the Department of Philosophy & Religion scholarships. Liberal Studies Most students take a combination of weekend, online, and evening course s to expedite degree completion. If only weekend courses are taken, degree completion may take somewhat longer. LIBERAL STUDIES MAJO R Liberal Studies promotes understanding of several disciplinary perspectives, a greater appreciation of differences and similarities among disciplines, and the integration of diverse views. This major is appropriate for students whose career and personal goals require no specific major. It is not recommended for students continuing toward a specialized advanced degree requiring a specific undergraduate major. Liberal Studies is particularly suited for those working professionals seeking to broaden their skil ls and enhance their opportunity for advancement. A Liberal Studies student will select one or two broad- based fields (clusters). If two clusters are selected, the student must take a 144 Texas Wesleyan University minimum of 9 hours in each cluster. Thus, proportions of courses within two clusters could be as follows: 27 hours in one cluster and 9 hours in the second cluster or 24 hours in one and 12 hours in the other or 21 hours in one and 15 hours in the other or 18 hours in one and 18 hours in the other. If only one cluster is chosen, courses from at least two disciplines must be represented. Students do not have to take courses in all of the disciplines listed within a cluster. The Liberal Studies major is housed within the School of Arts and Letters. Two degrees are possible in the Liberal Studies major: Bachelor of Science (no foreign language requirement) and Bachelor of Arts (12 hours of foreign language required). For students seeking teacher's certification, the Bachelor of Science is available with a designated Education cluster. The complete offerings are listed in the School of Arts and Letters section in this catalog and include traditional day classes and online courses. Students declaring Liberal Studies as their major may not have a second major or a minor either during or after completing their program of study. The Liberal Studies major was designed particularly for working professionals seeking to broaden their s kills and enhance their opportunity for advancement. Evening and weekend classes will not be offer ed within all clusters each semester. However, a student is permitted to transfer hours acquired at another college or university and apply those hours, if applicable, toward the Liberal Studies major. Traditional day classes and online offerings may supplement the course choices. Cluster I English Fine Arts/Music/Theater Arts* History Languages* 3PR - Pre -Professional Religion/Philosophy/Bib le/Ethics Cluster II Criminal Justice Education* Paralegal Studies Political Science Psychology Sociology Cluster III Business (Accounting, Business Administration, Economics, Finance, Management, Marketing) * Cluster IV Computer Science* Mathematics Science* *Indicates disciplines in which few or no weekend courses are planned. Special Academic Programs 145 Courses used to satisfy General Education Curriculum requirements cannot also be used to satisfy course requirements within the major. At least 45 credit hours of the degree must be earned at Texas Wesleyan University. A minimum of 24 hours of upper divisi on hours must be earned at Texas Wesleyan University; 18 of these upper division hours must be within the Liberal Studies major. Linguistic Diversity Bridge Program All domestic and international admits without college level transfer credit are subject to placement testing in English, Reading, and Mathematics prior to initial course registration with limited exceptions (see sections regarding Placement Exams on page 51 and Developmental Programs on page 1 38). Students not producing college ready scores in Reading and Writing are enrolled in the Developmental Program or, in the case of non native speakers of English, a Bridge Program specifically designed for linguistically diverse students. In the initial semester of the Bridge Program, students will enroll in 6 selected college credit hours along with 6 noncredit hours to improve reading and writing skills. Depending on the results o f subsequent placement testing, students will continue in the Bridge Program with select college level courses through the semester following. After successfully completing the Bridge Program and followed by the Developmental Program in Reading and Writing , if applicable, or through a qualifying score on an approved assessment, the student may enroll full time in college level courses. Students may at any time produce a score from an approved assessment documenting college readiness in Reading and Writing. This program consists of the following Writing and Reading courses , with placement determined by approved assessment: WRT 0311 Writing I for non native speakers WRT 0312 Writing II for non native speakers RDG 0311 Reading I for non native speakers RDG 0312 Reading II for non native speakers Any first year or transfer student placed into any Bridge Writing and/or Reading course must enroll in ASE 1311 Academic Success Experience: The Culture of College in the first term, to replace ASE 1111 Freshman Success. Students placed into Bridge Program courses may also enroll in selected college level General Education Curriculum Courses. Placement into any Bridge Program course does not prevent registration in developmental or coll ege-level mathematics courses, per the results of an approved assessment. Students who do not successfully complete the Bridge or Developmental Program sequence or score college ready on an approved assessment must repeat the most recent Bridge or Develop mental Program course(s). 146 Texas Wesleyan University A withdrawal of any kind from Bridge and/or Developmental Program courses will result in an automatic withdrawal from all active college level courses, in absence of a qualifying score on an approved assessment reflecting college level ability in Reading and Writing . Wesleyan Scholars Honors Program The purpose of the Wesleyan Scholars Program is to provide motivated students the opportunity to enrich their university experience, to recognize outstanding academic achievement beyond degree requirements, to provide a forum for student -student and student -faculty exchange of ideas, to celebrate opportunities for conversations across discipline boundaries, and to affirm the University as a place of informed and reasoned dialogue. The Wesleyan Scholars Program consists of two separate programs: University Honors and Departmental Honors. A student must earn either Departmental or University Honors (or both) for designation to appear on the student's diploma. UNIVERSITY HONORS \u2014UNIVERSITY SCHOLAR For admission into the University Honors Program, freshmen must have an SAT score of 1200 (Math and Verbal) or an ACT score of 24 and a high school GPA of 3.5. Students who transfer with fewer than 30 hours may be admitted to the University Honors Program if they have the above mentioned S AT or ACT scores and a c umulative transfer GPA of 3.5. College Board concordance tables are used to compare scores on the redesigned SAT with those that predate it. Texas Wesleyan and transfer students with 31 -60 hours may be admitted if they have a cumul ative 3.5 GPA. The following Honors Courses qualify for General Education Curriculum credit. WSP 1301 courses meet the Language Literacy, Composition competency, WSP 2301 courses meet the Language Literary, Literature competency, WSP 2302 courses meet t he Analytical Literacy competency, WSP 2303 courses meet the Cultural Literacy competency, WSP 2304 courses meet the Social Literacy competency, WSP 2406 courses meet the Analytical Literacy, Science competency, and WSP 2340 courses meet the Language Liter acy, Integrative Course competency for the General Education Curriculum. To qualify for University Honors recognition on their diplomas, students are required to complete four honors courses (WSP) and graduate with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.5. Tran sfer students who have completed an Honors Program with an Associates of Arts Degree and are eligible for the Wesleyan Scholars Honors Program are required to complete three honors courses (WSP) and graduate with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.5. Special Academic Programs 147 DEPAR TMENTAL HONORS \u2014WESLEYAN SCHOLAR Unless otherwise specified, students are eligible for the Departmental Honors Program and may enter their department's program at any time with the approval of the faculty of the student's major program and a GPA in their major of 3.5.

Special Academic Programs 151 Sociology Sociology Honors courses consist of both stand -alone seminar courses and upper division courses with a contractual Honors component. In the course of completing their program of study, it is expected th at Sociology students will complete at least 6 hours o f Honors credit. Courses that have an Honors component will be Departmental electives taught by a full -time Wesleyan faculty member. The honors component in these courses will generally consist of extra reading and an extra, full -length term paper. Conte nt of the reading would be determined in one of two ways. 1) The Honors student submits a list of readings which is then approved by the Instructor. 2) The instructor selects relevant readings that would be appropriate to the course. In general, the amount of reading is likely to be equivalent to an extra book (less if it is very dense, more if it is easier reading). The Instructor will be available for discussion on the subject during office hours or before and after class time, as the student arranges. Alternative Honors content will consist of doing professional sociological research, either supervised by the instructor, or in conjunction with an instructor, in which case the student could collect original data, conduct interviews, observe behavior or do content analysis of text and images. Or the student may perform secondary data analysis, and develop theoretical or conceptual analyses of a sociological issue. Each student will complete a written copy of their extended term paper, and will also presen t their project at a Departmental meeting at the end of the semester, at which faculty and students attend. Students will be encouraged to invite parents and/or friends to attend as well. Sociology courses with Honors component could be taken by a non - Sociology major (in particular, Liberal Studies). Sociology courses that could include an Honor component are as follows : SOC 2302H Social Problems SOC 3316H Social Perspectives on Psychology SOC 3321H Marriage and the Fam ily SOC 3342H Changing Roles of Men and Women SOC 3325H Deviant Behavior SOC 4323H Population and Society SOC 4 324H Social Science Research Methods SOC 4332H The Local Community SOC 4396H Social Theory Stand -alone courses will be offered periodically, on varying topics. These are likely to be scheduled in the summer or May term, outside of the regularly rotation of courses. Guest lecturers are also a possibility. To make the most of these opportunities, stand- alone honors courses may include non- honors students, with the caveat 152 Texas Wesleyan University that non- honors students would not get honors credit and should understand it may require more work than the normal course. Spanish Students will be admitted to the D epartmental Honors in Spanish if they have at least a 3.5 GPA in Spanish and Departmental approval. In order to fulfill the 6- hour requirement for Honors in Spanish, students will need to enroll in an H -designated version of one of the following courses. The honors portion of the course will be determined by the professor and the student. SPN 3311H Survey of Spanish- American Literature SPN 3301H Survey of Spanish Literature SPN 4369H Hispanic- American Literature Students must successfully complete tha t work before they can enroll in the sequel course SPN 4370H -Honors Research Seminar and Thesis. Continuing Education The University sponsors a limited number of continuing education programs. These programs may be taught by either full - or part -time faculty or staff of the University. Programs include opportunities for leadership training, customer relations, alternative dispute resolution, training for municipal officials, and small business entrepreneurship. Cont inuing education programs of the University do not lead to the awarding of academic credit. Each program is separately developed and administered.

Aerospace Studies /Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC ) The U.S. Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) provides women and men at Texas Christian University, Texas Wesleyan University, Dallas Baptist University, University of Texas at Arlington, Weatherford College, and Tarrant County College the education and training necessary to develop the management and leadership skills vital to professional Air Force officers. Enrollment in the General Military Course (first two years) is voluntary for eligible students and does not obligate non-scholarship students for further military service. The Professional Officer Course (last two years) is also voluntary but competitive. Because the Professional Officer Course leads to a commission in the U.S. Air Force, those selected to continue training in the POC will incur military obligation. Aerospace studies courses are taken concurrently with other degree programs. No degree is offered in aerospace studies, but up to 24 semester hours may be earned in aerospace studies over the four - year period . Some of the classes may be used to meet major elective requirements; students should see their academic adviser for confirmation. Students who enroll in aerospace studies classes must attend both classroom and leadership laboratory classes at TCU. The laboratory classes give students first -hand experience in developing leadership and organizational skills while preparing them for enrollment in the Professional Officer Course. AEROSPACE STUDIES PR OGRAM REQUIREMENTS Four -Year Program (that can be completed in as little as three years) This program enables students to take advantage of four years of Aerospace Studies courses. Each semester, for the first two years, cadets take a one -credit hour academic class and a one- credit hour Pass/No -Credit Leadership Laboratory (LLAB). The first two years collectively are referred to as the General Military Course (GMC). Upon successful completion of the GMC, cadets are selected for continuation in the program will attend a paid, four -week, field training course. After completing field training, cadets enroll in the final two years, referred to as the Professional Officer Course (POC). Each semester in the POC, students take a three- credit hour academic class and a one- credit hour Pass/No- Credit LLAB. 154 Texas Wesleyan University AFROTC uniforms and textbooks are issued by the unit for all GMC and POC cadets. More detailed information about the Air Force ROTC Program is available through the Department of Aerospace Studies. The department is located in office 247 of the Rickel Academic Wing on the TCU campus . Please visit www.afrotc.tcu.edu or call 817- 257- 7461 with any questions. Aerospace Studies General Qualifications Please call 817 -257-7461 or visit www.afrotc.tcu.edu for up- to-date entry requirements. AFROTC PROGRAM BENEF ITS As Air Force ROTC cadets, students are entitled to selective benefits. Social and co- curricular activities, together with leadership and academi c training, are all part of Air Force ROTC. All scholarship cadets and also non- scholarship POC cadets receive a nontaxable subsistence allowance each month during the school year. Drill team, honor guard and Arnold Air Honor Society are just a few social outlets for the cadets. Summer opportunities for cadets can include a paid visit to a military installation for two weeks, freefall parachuting, combat survival training, flight nurse shadowing and duty as a cadet training assistant at field training. AFROTC SCHOLARSHIPS Air Force ROTC offers scholarships that vary in length of award and amount based on academic major and applicant qualifications. All awarded scholarships pay a stipend for textbooks and fees, plus a monthly, nontaxable, stipend during the school year. Scholarship awards are based on specific academic majors related to the needs of the U.S. Air Force. The scholarship opportunities for in- college students are determined at the national level by Air Force ROTC Headquarters and are subsequently administered by the detachment/Department of Aerospace Studies. Scholarship applicants are selected using the whole- person concept, which includes objective factors (i.e., GPA, standardized test scores (SAT/ACT), and physic al fitness test) and subjective factors (i.e., personal evaluations). Because the scholarship program varies according to budget and needs of the Air Force, interested applicants should contact the Department of Aerospace Studies at 817 -257-7461 or www.af rotc.tcu.edu for specifics. AFROTC COMMISSIONING Upon successful completion of the AFROTC Program and baccalaureate degree, a student is commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. In some instances, entry onto active duty can be delayed by students continuing in post -baccalaureate degree programs. Special Academic Programs 155 Reserve Officers Training Corps (Army ROTC) DEPARTMENT OF MILITA RY SCIENCE Military science offers opportunities to develop confidence, self - esteem, and leadership skills to succeed in college and beyond. It is an academic curriculum that supplements a student's major and is designed to prepare qualified, high potential stude nts for service as commissioned officers in the United States Army and its reserve components (the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard). The Military Science program is composed of a two -year Basic Course, a five -week Leadership Development and Assessment Course (LDAC), and a two -year Advanced Course. Non -scholarship students enrolling only in freshman and sophomore level classes incur no obligation to serve in the military after graduation. Further, these classes satisfy the UCR physical education activity course requirement and can be used for elective credit. Upon completion of the requirements for the baccalaureate degree and Military Science training requirements, students are commissioned second lieutenants. Further, highly qualified commissionees who desire graduate or professional schooling prior to fulfilling their service obligation may apply for an educational delay. Four-year, three- year, and two -year programs are offered. Each program includes the option for qualified students to benefi t from a full tuition and fees scholarship. FOUR- YEAR PROGRAM The four -year program is divided into two portions, each consisting of four classes normally taken in sequence.

TWO -YEAR PROGRAM The two -year program is designed for students who either transfer into Texas Wesleyan University or elect to begin pursuing a commission in the fall of their junior year. It includes a paid four -week summer training session between the sophomore and junior years and the Advanced Course described under the four -year program. Application for the two -year program is normally made during the second semester 156 Texas Wesleyan University of the sophomore year. However, the two -year program is also open to juniors and seniors planning attendance at graduate school. The monthly cash allowance for students in the two- year progra m is the same as for other students in the Advanced Course. Numerous full tuition and fees scholarships are available for qualified two- year program applicants. SCHOLARSHIPS Four-year, three- year, and two- year scholarships are available to qualified applicants. Scholarships are available not to exceed $20,000 annually. Scholarships can be applied toward tuition and mandatory fees and provide an allowance for books. Four -Year Scholarships.

By meeting requirements for the two degrees simultaneously, students are able to earn the B.S. or B.A./M.Ed. in a shorter length of time than if each of these degrees were pursued separately. The combined B.S. or B.A./M.Ed. degree program gives students who plan to become Texas certified teachers the capability to complete the certification program hours of study required by the Texas State Board of Education. The two degrees may be completed in approximately five years. Enrollment mus t be continual and in consecutive semesters. Applicants are initially admitted into the Teacher Education Program and must follow the degree requirements of the program. Students must apply for the M.Ed. program after completing 90 hours. Applicants to the 5th Year Option degree program must meet the admission requirements of both the undergraduate and the graduate programs, and follow the application procedures for the respective programs. A Fifth Year Option education student will be transitioned from undergraduate (UG) status to graduate (GR) status by the Registrar's office at the time of his/her graduation from the undergraduate program. The student will be allowed to enroll in up to 9 hours of graduate classes during his/her final undergraduate sem esters. These classes will not count towards the undergraduate hours, but will count towards the graduate hours; these classes will be moved to the appropriate transcript by the Registrar's office. The student will continue to receive undergraduate financial aid through the final semester of undergraduate course work ( generally, when clinical teaching takes place). The student's first semester as a graduate student will be immediately following degree posting and consist of School of Education/Education 221 only graduate classes. At that time, his/her account will be coded as a GR student and managed accordingly by the Finan cial Aid office. Any questions regarding aid awards as a graduate student should be directed to the Office of Financial Aid.

ATP TECHNICAL STANDARDS (PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS) Athletic Training is a physically, mentally and emotionally demanding health care profession. Students must be able to carry equipment, stand for extended periods, and endure harsh weather conditions. Many of the mandatory clinical integration proficiencies require the ability to kneel, lift, carry and visually observe activities. The successful student must have fun ctional use of lower and upper extremities and be able to see with or without corrective lenses. Each Athletic Training Student is expected to maintain an appropriate fitness level to reduce the chance of injury and enhance the opportunity for successful c ompletion of clinical integration proficiencies. Many of the mandatory clinical rotation sites are off -campus. Students are required to provide their own transportation to these sites. Students may be su bject to a background check and/ or drug test prior t o admission to some of these affiliated sites. Students are referred to the Texas Wesleyan University 6TAthletic Training Program Policies and Procedures Manual 6T for additional information. Upper level students may be required to travel under the supervision of a clinical preceptor as a part of a clinical experience.

Specifically, the Biology concentration prepares students for direct entry into the Graduate Programs in Nurse Anesthesia, whereas the Social Sciences concentration prepares students for nursing leadersh ip positions, promotion, and/or career change within medical and public health fields. In addition, graduates are also prepared to enter graduate programs in public health, hospital administration, and laboratory sciences at other institutions. An Associ ates of Applied Science (A .A.S.) in Nursing is required to enroll in the program. Health Science majors complete their 32 credit -hour core curriculum at community college as part of the A.A.S. nursing degree compared to Wesleyan's current core curriculum of 45- 46 credit hours. Likewise, all Health Science majors will complete the following 12 hours of required related coursework. Majors will complete a 45- 46 hour Major Concentration Core in Biology or a 43 -44 hour Major Concentration Core Social Sciences. To complete the 124- hour degree, students have 34- 37 general electives to use to personalize their career plans, or they may be awarded up to 37 hours of elective credit for their A.A.S. degree nursing coursework. Enrollment in the Health Science prog ram is limited by space. Students are enrolled on a first -come, first -serve basis according to the number of openings available.
