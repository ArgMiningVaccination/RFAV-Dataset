COVID-19 Vaccine Facts The vaccines are safe COVID-19 vaccines were tested in large clinical trials to make sure they meet safety standards. Many people were recruited to participate in these trials to see how the vaccines offer protection to people of different ages, races, and ethnicities, as well as those with different medical conditions. Though the accelerated timeline for vaccine development was unprecedented, safety remains a top priority. The vaccines are effective There are currently four available vaccine types in the US. All three are considered quite effective. - Moderna - Pfizer - Johnson & Johnson - Novavax Exact levels of efficacy may vary as new COVID-19 variants emerge, and this continues to be studied. For up to date information from the CDC regarding effectiveness of the above vaccines, visit the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fvaccines%2Feffectiveness.html). Very few serious problems are reported after COVID-19 vaccination Most people do not have serious problems after receiving a vaccine. Some people might experience temporary injection site soreness, fever, chills, fatigue, headache, and muscle pain after receiving the COVID-19 vaccines. All of these side effects should go away in 24 to 48 hours. If you experience any symptoms after vaccination, you may choose to take an over-the-counter fever reducer or pain reliever. Most side effects are normal signs that your body is building protection. Historical information and on-going research shows us that long-term side effects are typically not a concern with vaccines. Severe and serious side effects of vaccines are rare and when they do occur, it is usually within 6 weeks of receiving a vaccine. Research related to the COVID-19 vaccines will continue, and the FDA and CDC are continuing to monitor safety to ensure long-term side effects are identified, should they arise. If an issue is identified, experts will take immediate action to determine the best course of action. COVID-19 vaccination is appropriate for those who previously tested positive for COVID-19 If you previously tested positive for COVID-19, you may still receive the vaccine, provided you have completed your period of isolation and are asymptomatic. Reinfection with the COVID-19 virus is possible and experts do not yet know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19. If you are able, receiving the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself. COVID-19 vaccinations are strongly recommended for all students, faculty, and staff For additional information, please visit the [4Maryland website](https://umd.edu/4Maryland/health/covid-19-vaccine).
