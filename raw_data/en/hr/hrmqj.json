Touch has been used in medicine since the early days of medical care. Healing by touch is based on the idea that illness or injury in one area of the body can affect all parts of the body. If, with manual manipulation, the other parts can be brought back to optimum health, the body can fully focus on healing at the site of injury or illness. Body techniques are often combined with those of the mind. Examples of body therapies include: - Chiropractic and osteopathic medicine - Massage - Body movement therapies - Tai chi - Yoga - Diet and herbs.

Many dietary and herbal approaches attempt to balance the body's nutritional well-being. Dietary and herbal approaches may include: - Dietary supplements - Herbal medicine - Nutrition/diet - External energy. Some people believe external energies from objects or other sources directly affect a person's health. An example of external energy therapy is: - Electromagnetic therapy - Reiki - Qigong - Mind.
