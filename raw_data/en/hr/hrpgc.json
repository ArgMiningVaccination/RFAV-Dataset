The curriculum also aims at emphasizing the underlying principles that are common to animals, plants and microorganisms as well as highlighting the relationship of Biology with other are as of knowledge. The format allows a simple, clear, sequential flow of concepts. It relates the s tudy of biology to real life through the developments in use of technology. It links the discoveries and innovations in biology to everyday life such as environment, industry, health and agriculture. The updated curriculum also focuses on understanding and application of scientific principles, while ensuring that ample opportunities and scope for learning and appreciating basic concepts continue to be available within its framework. The prescribed syllabus is expected to: promote understanding of basic prin ciples of Biology encourage learning of emerging knowledge and its relevance to individual and society promote rational/scientific attitude towards issues related to population, environment and development enhance awareness about environmental issues, problems and their appropriate solutions create awareness amongst the learners about diversity in the living organisms and developing respect for other living beings appreciate that the most complex biological phenomena are built on essentially simple processes It is expected that the students would get an exposure to various branches of Biology in the curriculum in a more contextual and systematic manner as they study its various units.
