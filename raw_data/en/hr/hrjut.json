R.A. 302 1 UNITED S TATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ----------------------------------------------------------x THE ROMAN CATHOLIC DIOCESE OF BROOKLYN, NEW YORK, Plaintiff , vs. GOVERNOR ANDREW M. CUOMO in his official capacity, Defendant . : : : : : : : : : : : Case No. COMPLAINT JURY TRIAL DEMANDED ----------------------------------------------------------x Plaintiff The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, New York (the \u0093Diocese\u0094 or \u0093Plaintiff\u0094), by and through its attorneys, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, for its Complaint against Defendant Governor Andrew M. Cuomo, in his official capacity, alleges as follows: NATURE OF THE CASE 1. This case concerns the government\u0092s wholesale infringement of a fundamental First Amendment right\u0097the free exercise of religion\u0097that, if allowed to stand, will prevent parishioners in Brooklyn and Queens from being able to attend mass even though the executive order at issue is not even remotely tailored to the compelling interest required to justify interference with that fundamental right. Injunctive relief is therefore necessary to protect and preserve Plaintiff\u0092s and its parishioners\u0092 constitutional rights in the face of this government overreach. 2. On October 6, 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a new series of overbroad COVID-19 restrictions directed at \u0093Houses of Worship\u0094 in certain neighborhoods that will effectively force over two dozen churches within the Diocese of Brooklyn to close their doors, even though those churches have been reopened for months in R.A. 1Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 1 of 22 PagelD #: 1 20 CV 4844 2 strict adherence to all medical and governmental guidance, without any COVID-related incidents whatsoever. The Governor now proposes to limit in-person attendance at all \u0093Houses of Worship\u0094 to the lesser of 10 people or 25% of church capacity in certain designated geographical areas, and to the lesser of 25 people or 33% of church capacity in others. As applied to the Diocese, whose impacted churches overwhelmingly seat upwards of 500 to 1,000 parishioners, the percentage caps (which track existing attendance restrictions) are rendered wholly illusory, and thus the churches will be placed in the untenable position of limiting attendance at Sunday mass and other foundational Catholic services such as baptisms, weddings, and funerals, to just 10 worshippers in designated \u0093red\u0094 zones or just 25 worshippers in designated \u0093orange\u0094 zones. Meanwhile, all other essential businesses can remain open without any capacity limitations whatsoever, and in the orange zones, even most non-essential businesses can remain open without any capacity limitations. This express targeting of religious practice for unwarranted, disparate treatment\u0097including the very \u0093physical acts that constitute the free exercise of religion,\u0094 such as \u0093\u0091assembling with others for a worship service [and] participating in sacramental use of bread and wine,\u0094 Cent. Rabbinical Cong. of U.S. & Canada v. N.Y.C. Dep\u0092t of Health & Mental Hygiene , 763 F.3d 183, 193 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting Employment Div. v. Smith , 294 U.S. 872, 877 (1990))\u0097violates Plaintiff\u0092s core First Amendment rights and cannot stand, especially as applied to the Diocese\u0092s churches, which have operated safely for months now, strictly adhering to existing government guidelines and unquestionably protecting their parishioners from any spread of COVID-19. The Diocese therefore now files suit to enjoin the application of the 10- and 25-person capacity limitations on its churches within these \u0093red\u0092 and \u0093orange\u0094 zones. To be clear, the Diocese does not challenge\u0097and, indeed, has supported and will continue to adhere to\u0097the percentage capacity caps, consistent with how its churches have R.A. 2Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 2 of 22 PagelD #: 2 3 been operating safely for months. But the Governor's new restrictions go way too far, infringe way too much, and have no legitimate basis, as applied to the Diocese\u0092s churches. 3. At his press conference announcing the new restrictions, the Governor openly admitted that the rules \u0093are most impactful on houses of worship.\u0094 But it is well-settled that \u0093official action that targets religious conduct for distinctive treatment\u0094 is subject to the most \u0093rigorous of scrutiny.\u0094 Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah , 508 U.S. 520, 534 (1993). The Governor\u0092s action here cannot come close to satisfying this strict scrutiny, especially as-applied to the Diocese, which has at all times gone above and beyond in implementing health and safety precautions in response to the pandemic, and has seen no spike or outbreak of COVID-19 relating to church attendance. At his press conference, the Governor alluded to COVID spread among other communities that are alleged to have flouted prior guidance. But this purported basis for the new rules belies any contention that the restraints on Plaintiff\u0092s religious liberty are narrowly tailored: To the extent the Governor is aware of or suspects that certain communities or congregations are not adhering to public health regulations, the proper, more narrowly tailored solution is to enforce existing law as to those alleged violators, or to tailor any new restrictions (assuming new restrictions are necessary, an issue on which Plaintiff takes no position) to the specific alleged violations, not to impose categorical restrictions on the free exercise of religion of all citizens across entire zip codes, including those\u0097like Plaintiff\u0097who have voluntarily exceeded State public health requirements to great success. 4. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit United States soil, the Diocese of Brooklyn wasted no time implementing voluntary, proactive safety countermeasures to combat it, even when that meant altering centuries-old religious traditions sacred to the Catholic Church. As R.A. 3Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 3 of 22 PagelD #: 3 4 early as January 2020, when news of the coronavirus began to dominate United States airwaves, albeit largely from thousands of miles away, Plaintiff suspended the receiving of the Precious Blood by its parishioners and strongly encouraged that Holy Communion be taken by hand. And when the pandemic began to ravage the streets of New York City, Plaintiff only increased its countermeasures, culminating in the Diocese ordering the closure of all of its churches and parishes effective March 16\u0097 before New York State officially went on \u0093pause.\u0094 When the State issued its lockdown measures shortly thereafter, Plaintiff faithfully abided by both the government- and self-imposed restrictions, shuttering its churches for months on end. 5. Reopening church doors was achieved only through countless hours spent meticulously crafting protocols that would permit parishioners to safely return to worship. The Diocese assembled an internal committee, chaired by Joseph Esposito, the former Commissioner of New York City Emergency Management and Chief of Department of the New York City Police Department, to study and implement COVID-19 safety measures. When the church doors reopened, all churches within the Diocese operated under the strict protocols put in place by the committee to ensure that worship was conducted in the safest manner possible: Parishioners were required to wear masks; every other pew was left empty; occupied pews were spaced to accord with social distancing protocols; traffic flow was managed to avoid parishioners passing one another; and sacred church practices, including Holy Communion, were either reformed or altogether suspended to preserve the health of the congregation. At every turn, the Diocese, through the work of the committee, went consistently above and beyond what the government mandated. 6. But it has worked. Parishioners have successfully returned to worship, albeit in smaller numbers and with heightened diligence. None of the Catholic churches in the Diocese R.A. 4Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 4 of 22 PagelD #: 4 5 (or elsewhere in New York City) has experienced any new outbreak or spread of COVID-19. And yet this delicate balance between religious liberty and public health and safety has now been upended by the Governor\u0092s broad-brush response to combatting apparent pockets of COVID-19 spikes in some faith communities by imposing on all faith communities in the affected areas disparate treatment\u0097whether or not those communities have been compliant with the preexisting rules and operating safely, as the Diocese\u0092s churches have. This blunt instrument\u0097which was announced by press release rather than by executive order and was thus shielded from public comment\u0097effectively orders the Diocese\u0092s churches within the \u0093red\u0094 and \u0093orange\u0094 zones to once again shut their doors. That process, albeit excruciatingly painful to a community that flourishes through in-person worship, may have been necessary in March, when the pandemic raged unabated and neither the church nor the State was in position to combat it effectively. But it is altogether unnecessary now, when the Diocese has already proven that its rigorous countermeasures are effective and has not experienced even a single COVID-19 outbreak since reopening church doors. 7. The Supreme Court has long recognized that although there exists \u0093an acknowledged power of a local community to protect itself against an epidemic threatening the safety of all,\u0094 such restrictions may be exercised \u0093in such an arbitrary, unreasonable manner, or might go so far beyond what was reasonably required for the safety of the public, as to authorize or compel the courts to interfere for the protection of such persons.\u0094 Jacobsen v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts , 197 U.S. 11, 28 (1905). That is this case. Given the substantial burdens on religious practice the Governor\u0092s capacity limitations would impose, the lack of any evidence whatsoever that their application to the Diocese is tailored to any public health interest, and the heavy burden on the government to justify restrictions expressly and directly targeted at R.A. 5Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 5 of 22 PagelD #: 5 6 constitutionally protected religious activity, the restrictions at issue here cannot withstand First Amendment scrutiny as-applied to Plaintiff. 8. This Court should accordingly follow the lead of courts throughout the country and conclude that broad-brush restrictions on religious exercise, such as the Governor\u0092s latest executive order, as applied here to these Roman Catholic churches, should be enjoined. See, e.g. , Roberts v. Neace , 958 F.3d 409 (6th Cir. Maryville Baptist Church, Inc. v. Beshear , 957 F.3d 3488742 WL 2514313 May 16, Beshear , WL 2305307 (E.D. Ky. May 8, 2020) (all enjoining government actions attempting to restrict the free exercise of religion on COVID- related public health grounds). The COVID-19 pandemic has now been raging in this country for over six months and, unfortunately, looks to have many more months ahead of it. The Diocese takes the pandemic\u0097and the threat it poses to its parishioners\u0097extremely seriously. But it cannot be that the pandemic alone justifies restrictions that, in another time, would plainly contravene the Constitution. \u0093[R]estrictions inexplicably applied to one group and exempted from another do little to further [public safety] goals and do much to burden religious freedom.\u0094 Roberts , 958 F.3d at 414-15. And \u0093[w]hile the law may take periodic naps during a pandemic, [courts] will not let it sleep through one.\u0094 Id. at 415. This Court should therefore enjoin the Governor from enforcing the 10- and 25-person maximum attendance restrictions as applied to Roman Catholic churches in the designated geographic \u0093red\u0094 and \u0093orange\u0094 zones in Brooklyn and Queen. PARTIES 9. Plaintiff The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, New York is a division of the Roman Catholic Church. The Diocese was founded in 1853 and heads 186 Catholic parishes and R.A. 6Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 6 of 22 PagelD #: 6 7 210 Catholic churches in the Brooklyn and Queens regions of New York. The Diocese is headquartered at 310 Prospect Park West in Brooklyn, New York. The Diocese brings this action for itself and on behalf of its churches and parishes and their member-parishioners. 10. Defendant Andrew Cuomo is the Governor of the State of New York. On October 6, 2020, Governor Cuomo announced an initiative that, inter alia , slashes the capacity limits for houses of worship in certain areas identified by zip code, including those in Brooklyn and Queens where the Diocese operates. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 11. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over Plaintiff\u0092s constitutional claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. 12. Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b)(2) because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district. STATEMENT OF THE CASE I. The Diocese Provides A Place Of Worship To Catholics In Brooklyn And Queens For Over 165 Years. 13. The Diocese of Brooklyn was founded in 1853. During that time, more than five million tired and poor Irish Catholic immigrants arrived at the port of New York in search of a better life. In addition to shelter and opportunity, these immigrants sought the opportunity to freely practice their religion and openly follow the tenets of the Roman Catholic faith. The Diocese sought to address that need for all those immigrants who settled in Brooklyn and Queens. 14. Today, the combined population of Brooklyn and Queens stands at more than 4.9 million, of whom 1.5 million identify as Catholics. The Diocese of Brooklyn serves this community in various ways. Due to the multicultural and diverse populations of the two R.A. 7Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 7 of 22 PagelD #: 7 8 boroughs, masses are regularly held in 33 different languages across the Diocese, throughout 186 parishes with 210 churches. Through 26 ethnic ministries, the Diocese promotes cultural events and provides an opportunity for immigrants to belong to the larger community while preserving and sharing their uniqueness and traditions. In the year 2019 alone, the Diocese celebrated 15,885 Baptisms, 11,957 First Communions, 9,549 Confirmations and 1,951 Marriages, and had an average weekly attendance of almost 230,000 spread across over 1,000 weekly Sunday Masses in Brooklyn and Queens. 15. Throughout its 165-plus year existence, the Diocese has provided irreplaceable gifts to its parishioners and the surrounding community. Its parishes have enriched the lives of the people of its community by providing spiritual leadership, a place to worship freely, and a moral compass through New York\u0092s greatest triumphs as well as its darkest moments. II. The Diocese Proactively Shutters To Combat The Spreading Pandemic. 16. In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic descended on New York City and the United States at large. The Diocese acted swiftly in response, implementing drastic countermeasures even before required to do so by government mandate, even when those measures cut to the heart of the Catholic Church\u0092s time-honored religious rituals. 17. The Diocese began rolling out COVID-19 safety measures as early as January 31, 2020, with the Office of the Vicar General issuing a strong recommendation to Diocesan pastors and administrators that Holy Communion\u0097the most sacred and time-honored ritual of the Catholic Church\u0097be received only by hand, a shift from the general practice detailed below. 18. In a memo issued to pastors and administrators on March 4, 2020, the Most Reverend Raymond Chappetto further emphasized that recommendation, writing, \u0093It is VERY STRONGLY suggested that Holy Communion be received in the hand as long as this [coronavirus] threat continues.\u0094 The memo also suspended the distribution of the Precious R.A. 8Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 8 of 22 PagelD #: 8 9 Blood\u0097the drinking of wine from a chalice as part of Holy Communion\u0097and required that the clergy disinfect their hands before distributing Holy Communion. 19. According to Catholic belief, upon consecration, the substance of the bread offered during Holy Communion becomes the Body of Christ, and the substance of the wine offered during Holy Communion becomes the Blood of Christ. Ordinarily, parishioners are provided a wafer either in their hand or on their tongue, and at many churches those parishioners are also provided with the option of receiving wine. However, in response to the pandemic, the Diocese instructed that Holy Communion no longer be taken on the tongue, and that wine no longer be distributed during Communion at all. 20. The March 4 memo implemented a number of other safety measures, which scaled back, or eliminated altogether, other religious rituals important to Catholic worship. The memo, for example, suspended the Sign of Peace as traditionally marked with a handshake and ordered that Holy Water fonts be emptied. 21. On March 11, 2020, as COVID-19 continued to spread throughout New York City, the Office of the Vicar General issued a letter that again \u0093strongly recommended\u0094 that Holy Communion be received by hand and that rehashed the other safety measures implemented by the Diocese, including the suspension of the Precious Blood and the Sign of Peace by a handshake. 22. Just four days later, in response to rapidly changing conditions in the City, and in advance of any governmental shutdown orders, the Diocese announced that it would be canceling all public masses effective the next day. That difficult decision followed on the heels of guidance issued by the Most Reverend Nicholas DiMarzio, the Bishop of Brooklyn, dispensing parishioners from their obligation to attend Mass. R.A. 9Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 9 of 22 PagelD #: 9 10 23. On March 19, the Diocese, at the direction of Bishop DiMarzio, ordered all of its parishes and churches altogether shuttered. 24. In the days and weeks that followed, Governor Cuomo issued a series of regulations restricting public gatherings and other non-essential activities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most notably, on March 20, Governor Cuomo issued the \u0093New York State on PAUSE\u0094 order, which required all non-essential businesses across the State to shut down in-person operations entirely. Pursuant to that order, on March 23, Governor Cuomo implemented a total ban on non-essential gatherings of any size, held for any reason. 25. The Diocese of Brooklyn and its over 200 churches immediately and strictly complied with this ban. Indeed, the Diocese voluntarily closed its doors in the interest of public health and safety prior to Governor Cuomo\u0092s \u0093PAUSE\u0094 order, emphasizing that it would \u0093comply \u0093the State\u0092s regulations,\u0094 and \u0093urged\u0094 parishioners \u0093to take the necessary precautions, including remaining at a safe distance from others.\u0094 26. Governor Cuomo\u0092s pandemic-related orders remained in effect throughout the spring and into the summer. New York City, one of the epicenters of the pandemic, was among the last places in the State to begin the process of reopening. It was not until late May that houses of worship were permitted to open for private worship and small gatherings of 10 people or less, not until June 8 that the City officially began phase one of its reopening efforts, and not until June 22 that houses of worship could officially open their doors to congregants at a 25% capacity as part of the second phase of the City\u0092s reopening. Phase four of the City\u0092s reopening efforts, which permitted houses of worship to operate at 33% capacity, did not commence until July 20 (though, as discussed below, the Diocese has voluntarily refrained from admitting that additional capacity). R.A. 10Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 10 of 22 PagelD #: 10 11 27. The Diocese of Brooklyn remained closed even as the City began to reopen, faithfully abiding by its own safety measures and exceeding those implemented by the State. Although the State permitted houses of worship to open their doors at 25% capacity on June 22, churches within the Diocese, following guidance from Diocesan leadership, did not conduct in- person weekday services until June 29, and did not reopen for weekend public mass until the July 4 weekend. During that opening and at all times thereafter, the Diocese and its member churches strictly complied with the 25% capacity requirement, and as discussed in more detail below, directed and implemented numerous other significant safety protocols, procedures, and monitoring. 28. During the period of total closure, numerous weddings, funerals, and baptisms were canceled. As the government-imposed restrictions eased in May and June, some of these ceremonies were allowed to take place, but were strictly capped at 10 people. All mass services were similarly cancelled during the period of closure, and parishioners across Brooklyn and Queens were instructed to pray and worship from the safety of their homes. 29. This period of closure was extremely painful for the Diocese of Brooklyn and its faith community. In addition to the physical and emotional toll that the pandemic took on the community, parishioners were denied the ability to attend in-person mass, which is of critical spiritual importance in the Catholic faith. Likewise, the cancellations or severe curtailments of baptisms, weddings, funerals, and other ceremonies of enormous religious and personal significance were difficult for many members of the Catholic faith. Nevertheless, the Diocese abided by the State\u0092s severe restrictions\u0097and imposed its own exacting restrictions on its various parishes, even in advance of the State mandate to shutter\u0097because doing so was in the best interest of the health and welfare of Diocese\u0092s community. R.A. 11Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 11 of 22 PagelD #: 11 12 III. The Diocese Successfully Responds To the COVID-19 Pandemic And Safely Reopens Its Doors. 30. Even as churches throughout Brooklyn and Queens remained shuttered, the Diocesan leadership worked steadily behind the scenes to ensure that, when the time came, the Diocese would be able to offer congregants a safe space for religious expression and worship. To that end, the Diocese established a commission to craft procedures that would address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic while simultaneously ensuring that their parishioners\u0092 spiritual needs would be met. 31. The commission was chaired by Joseph Esposito, the former Commissioner of New York City Emergency Management and former Chief of Department of the New York City Police Department. There were eleven other members of the commission, including priests and laypeople, which was designed to capture input from various stakeholders in the community. Members of the commission consulted closely with medical professionals, as well as several of Mr. Esposito\u0092s prior colleagues in Emergency Management and the Police Department. 32. The commission met numerous times over the course of May and June, meticulously studying the COVID-19 guidelines that Governor Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had published, as well as all applicable federal, State, and City ordinances and directives related to the pandemic, in order to provide appropriate instruction and guidance to church leadership. Each Friday, the commission provided proposed protocols to Bishop Chappetto. These protocols were then sent to each parish in the Diocese by means of weekly memoranda, as well as posted to the Diocese\u0092s public website and further transmitted to the public via social media. To ensure that these protocols reached as wide an audience as possible, the Diocese engaged a media company to assist with the distribution. R.A. 12Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 12 of 22 PagelD #: 12 13 33. Starting in late May 2020, the Diocese\u0092s churches opened in a staged approach that has been conducted in accordance with the iterative regulations promulgated by New York State and New York City. In doing so, all Catholic Churches within the Diocese of Brooklyn adopted the recommendations of the Diocese\u0092s COVID-19 commission on how to institute procedures to safely accommodate congregants\u0092 constitutional and spiritual right to worship and engage in Catholic religious practices. During this initial period of reopening, churches within the Diocese did not offer mass and limited all church visitors and attendance at ceremonies such as funerals to 10 people. 34. By late June, churches within the Diocese could officially reopen at 25% capacity under applicable City and State guidelines. However, upon the recommendation of the Diocese\u0092s COVID-19 commission, the Diocese waited until June 29 to reopen for in-person weekday services at the 25% capacity limit, and did not reopen for weekend mass until July 4 (again, operating at only 25% capacity). This choice to proceed cautiously and gradually was made to ensure that all proper safety protocols had been implemented by each parish within the Diocese, and because church leadership believed that reopening for weekend services over July 4 would allow for a particularly \u0093soft\u0094 reopening given the expectation that many parishioners would be out of town for the holiday weekend. 35. In the lead-up to the 25% capacity reopenings, church leadership assisted various parishes in obtaining all the supplies that they would need to safely open their doors. The Diocese identified the types of supplies churches would need to have on hand to reopen, and published guidance about where parishes could obtain essential items such masks, disinfectants, fogging machines, and hand sanitizer. Church leadership further instructed that any parish that was unable to secure the necessary supplies or implement the relevant protocols in advance of R.A. 13Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 13 of 22 PagelD #: 13 14 the July 4 soft reopening date delay their reopening until they could do so and thus guarantee the safety of their parishioners. 36. Prior to reopening, all churches were thoroughly sanitized, either by outside companies or with equipment recommended by Rocklyn Assets Corp., the property office for the Diocese. Rocklyn Assets Corp. prepared a comprehensive instructional video for those parishes that chose to sanitize their churches without outside assistance, in order to demonstrate the proper techniques for sanitizing large spaces. 37. Additionally, prior to reopening, all parishes were advised to report any instances of COVID-19 directly to Bishop Chappetto. This instruction complemented a system that had been in place since March, whereby priests were encouraged to raise any COVID-related questions or concerns directly with Bishop Chappetto. 38. Since reopening in early July, each church within the Diocese has had to adhere to strict protocols regarding church practices and services. Iterative rounds of written protocols and a PowerPoint deck provided to parishes before and after reopening outlined these procedures in detail. Among other requirements, churches within the Dioceses must: Ensure that parishioners wear a mask at all times, except for a brief moment when they receive a socially distanced Holy Communion; Block off every other pew so congregants cannot sit immediately in front of or behind one another; Mark off seats with tape six feet apart within each open pew to ensure appropriate social distancing; Provide hand sanitizer stations throughout the church; Remove all hymnals, missalettes, and other worship aids from pews; Only open for abridged hours both on weekdays and for weekend masses; R.A. 14Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 14 of 22 PagelD #: 14 15 Keep multiple doors open for various points of entry and exit, and direct traffic in and out of the church, to ensure that worshipers enter and exit in a socially distant manner; and Retain additional ushers and security guards to enforce compliance with all of the required procedures and protocols. 39. The Diocese has also continued to abide by the changes to fundamental church practices instituted at the outset of the pandemic. Most notably, the Diocese has retained the changes to the giving and receiving of the sacrament of Holy Communion, requiring that Communion be taken by hand and dispensing with the distribution of wine. 40. These preventative measures have proven immensely successful. In the three months since Catholic churches in Brooklyn and Queens have reopened, there have not been any reported outbreaks of COVID-19. As a result, in recent weeks, the Diocese had finally begun work on plans to safely increase the capacity of its churches to 33%, as would have been permitted under the then-applicable government regulations. IV. The State Implements New, Overbroad, And Unduly Burdensome Restrictions Directed At Houses of Worship And Applicable to Catholic Churches In Brooklyn And Queens. 41. On October 6, in response to upticks of COVID-19 cases localized in certain non- Catholic communities in New York, including in certain Brooklyn and Queens neighborhoods, Governor Cuomo announced a \u0093New Cluster Action Initiative\u0094 (the \u0093Initiative\u0094). Governor Cuomo announced his Initiative by press release instead of by Executive Order, thereby depriving the public an opportunity to review and comment on the Initiative prior to its implementation. 42. The Initiative identifies certain purported at-risk areas, by zip code, and divides those areas into \u0093red,\u0094 \u0093orange,\u0094 and \u0093yellow\u0094 zones, with red zones representing the highest R.A. 15Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 15 of 22 PagelD #: 15 16 density of new COVID-19 cases, orange zones representing a warning area, and yellow zones representing a precautionary area. 43. As is relevant here, the Initiative targets certain areas in Brooklyn that are divided into red, orange, and yellow zones, and certain areas in Queens, each also divided into the three zones. The Diocese operates numerous churches and parishes falling within these purportedly at-risk areas, including 13 churches and parishes falling within the severely restricted red zones and 11 falling within the orange zones. 44. The Initiative drastically inhibits the operation of, and in fact effectively shutters, all Catholic churches in red and orange zones, requiring that they operate with a 10-person maximum in red zones, or 25-person maximum in orange zones. While the Initiative also provides for a 25% capacity limit in red zones and a 33% capacity limit in orange zones, these percentage caps are illusory, as the Initiative limits operations to the lesser of the fixed 10- or 25- person limits or the percentage capacity limits. 45. The restrictions do not account for, or make any distinction based on, the size of a church. Take, for example, a church which typically houses 1,000 parishioners, safely operating at a 25% capacity as a countermeasure to COVID-19. The Governor\u0092s Initiative requires that church to reduce its already COVID-19-reduced capacity from 250 parishioners to 10 (if located within a red zone) or 25 (if located within an orange zone). 46. All of the Diocese\u0092s 13 churches in the red zone, and all but one of the Diocese\u0092s 11 churches in the orange zone can accommodate 500 or more people, with the remaining church seating 200. Indeed, 12 of these churches\u0097including four in the red zone\u0097can accommodate 750 or more people, and two churches in the orange zone seat over 1,000. The Initiative thus R.A. 16Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 16 of 22 PagelD #: 16 17 forces even the very smallest of these churches, operating safely at 25% capacity, to cut its occupancy by 80% (from 50 parishioners to 10, if within the red zone). 47. The Initiative also entirely shutters any schools falling within red or orange zones, including those Catholic schools operated by the Diocese, thereby depriving students of an in- person Catholic education, despite no evidence of COVID-19 outbreaks at those facilities. 48. And while the Initiative shutters non-essential businesses located in red zones and restricts dining to takeout only, all \u0093essential\u0094 businesses\u0097a broad category that includes everything from grocery stores to banks to pet shops\u0097remain open without capacity limitations. In orange zones, commercial businesses remain largely unaffected, with almost all essential and non-essential businesses remaining open without capacity limitations of any kind. In the orange zones, only high risk, non-essential businesses, like gyms, are subject to closure, and restaurants are limited to outdoor dining with a four-person maximum per table (but no overarching capacity limit). 49. During a press conference announcing the Initiative, Governor Cuomo recognized that his order will disproportionately impact houses of worship, noting, \u0093Obviously these rules, the new rules are most impactful on houses of worship.\u0094 The Governor further claimed that \u0093[t]his virus is not coming from non-essential businesses,\u0094 but rather \u0093[t]his is about mass gatherings\u0094 and \u0093one of the prime places of mass gatherings are houses of worship.\u0094 50. In the course of explaining his action on this \u0093sensitive topic,\u0094 Governor Cuomo referenced his \u0093love for the Orthodox [Jewish] community\u0094 and how, in his view, \u0093[t]he Torah speaks about how certain religious obligations can be excused if you are going to save a life.\u0094 It appears the Governor may have been responding to certain press reports documenting COVID- R.A. 17Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 17 of 22 PagelD #: 17 18 19 outbreaks within the Orthodox Jewish community.1 The Governor also claimed that \u0093we\u0092ve seen one church infect people,\u0094 an apparent reference to a headline from a press clipping that simultaneously appeared on the screen at the press conference. This article, however, was a report on an outbreak at an upstate Slavic Pentecostal Church at which masks were treated as optional and video evidence suggested that almost everyone was unmasked. 51. Despite his focus on COVID-19 outbreaks in certain geographically concentrated, socially insular religious communities located within the targeted areas (and his vague allusion to an outbreak at an upstate facility with insufficient COVID-19 protocols), the Governor has made no attempt to ameliorate the disproportionate hardship the Initiative will effect on other communities, like the Diocese\u0092s faith community, that have successfully implemented COVID- 19 countermeasures and that have experienced no COVID-19 outbreaks to date. V. The New Restrictions Effectively Shutter The Diocese, Despite Its Proven Success At Combating The Pandemic. 52. Since reopening, churches across the Diocese have seen a steady increase in the number of people seeking to attend mass or visit a church to pray. Indeed, certain parishes have had to rely on overflow rooms for parishioners (which the Diocese subjects to the same capacity limitations) to ensure that the 25% capacity limit could be honored, while still providing a space for congregants to worship in person. This return to in-person worship has been a lifeline to many in the religious community, and heartening for those in church leadership who were pained by the months of (admittedly necessary) closure during the peak of the pandemic. Effectively closing the doors of the church again now would be devastating to the community, and would 1 See, e.g. , Gina Bellafante, \u0093When Covid Flared Again in Orthodox Jewish New York,\u0094 N.Y. Times (Oct. 5, 2020); Kristina Sgueglia & Melanie Schuman, \u0093New York sees startling uptick in Covid-19 cases in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods,\u0094 CNN (Sept. 30, 2020). R.A. 18Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 18 of 22 PagelD #: 18 19 grossly infringe on the First Amendment rights of Catholics in the affected areas of Brooklyn and Queens. 53. Assembly in the church is at the core of Catholic faith. By gathering in person, Catholics show support for each other and their fellow congregants. Additionally, the sacrament of Holy Communion, a central component of the spiritual lives of Catholics, may only be received in person. As emphasized by Bishop Chappetto, the Order\u0092s effective prohibition on in- person assembly and worship would be \u0093devastating and spiritually harmful.\u0094 54. The Order would also infringe upon other critical religious ceremonies, such as baptisms, weddings, and funerals. In-person assembly for these and similar services is essential to the Catholic community. By causing the cancellation or severe curtailment of such services, the Order would impose irreparable harm on the Diocese of Brooklyn and those it serves. 55. Nor is it any relief to the Diocese and those it serves that the Order allows for gatherings of 10 or 25 people in the red and orange zones, respectively. As emphasized above, such caps\u0097when considered against the number of people that would otherwise be (safely) served by the affected churches, even after honoring a 25% capacity limit\u0097would eviscerate the congregation, including because it would render it effectively impossible to conduct public mass. And these caps would require priests to perform the impossible task of choosing a small minority of parishioners to participate in worship in person, while leaving the remaining would-be worshipers out on the street. In addition, the opportunity to conduct lifecycle events such as weddings, funerals, and baptisms inside the church among a broad (but controlled) compliment of family, friends, and clergy is spiritually significant. R.A. 19Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 19 of 22 PagelD #: 19 20 CLAIM FOR RELIEF Free Exercise \u0096 First Amendment; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 56. Plaintiff repeats and realleges the allegations set forth above as though fully set forth herein. 57. The First Amendment\u0092s Free Exercise Clause provides that \u0093Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u0094 U.S. Const. amend I. Where, as here, a law targets religious practice for disparate treatment and is neither neutral nor generally applicable, that law is assessed under the Supreme Court\u0092s strict scrutiny rubric. 58. The Governor, acting under color of State law, has deprived and will continue to deprive Plaintiff of its First Amendment rights. 59. Specifically, the Governor has instituted an Initiative that plainly and unconstitutionally targets religious practice for at least three reasons. First, its text limits \u0093Houses of Worship\u0094 located in red zones to 25% capacity with a 10-person maximum and \u0093Houses of Worship\u0094 in the orange zone to 33% capacity with a 25-person maximum. Similar restrictions do not apply to secular businesses like grocery stories and pet food shops. Second , the way the order operates in practice, including the numerous exceptions to the capacity limitations that apply to secular businesses, make clear that the order targets religious practice. Even in the most restrictive \u0093Cluster\u0094 in the order\u0097the red zone\u0097where only \u0093essential\u0094 secular businesses are permitted to remain open, the capacity limitations the Governor\u0092s order imposes on Houses of Worship simply do not apply to non-religious institutions. Third, the Governor\u0092s own words conceding that \u0093the new rules[] are most impactful on houses of worship\u0094 make clear that his order targets religious practice for disparate treatment and is neither neutral nor generally applicable. The Initiative\u0092s burdens on religious practice also are not slight: The Initiative will R.A. 20Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 1 Filed 10/08/20 Page 20 of 22 PagelD #: 20 21 force the closure of numerous Churches and effectively forbid essential in-person religious practice\u0097practice that the Church is able to undertake (and has undertaken) in a safe way. Because the Initiative specifically targets the practice of religion, strict scrutiny applies. 60. The Initiative\u0092s red and orange zone caps of 10 and 25 people, respectively, do not survive strict scrutiny because those caps are not narrowly tailored to the government\u0092s interest in promoting public health and safety, particularly as applied to the Diocese. Defendant can offer no evidence that COVID-19 infections have arisen at any Church in the Diocese but rather has identified COVID-19 infections that he claims arose from the practices of entirely distinct religious communities\u0097including one as far away as Rochester. To the extent the Governor is concerned with COVID-related compliance issues in those other communities, there is clearly a less restrictive means of combatting that issue: Enforce the existing rules in those communities. The Initiative also fails to take into account the significant investments of time, money, and effort the Church has undertaken to ensure its worship is fully consistent with and even exceeds the State\u0092s public safety standards, including its altering of fundamental Catholic practices to ensure the safety of parishioners and the community at large. The capacity caps in particular also ignore the distinction between sizes of houses of worship\u0097a particular problem as applied to churches in the Diocese, all but two of which seat more than 500 people and some more than 1,000. Finally, the Initiative is clearly untailored as applied to the Diocese given the starkly different consequences the order imposes on secular business, allowing, for instance, hundreds of people to shop at a grocery store but limiting worship in a 1,200 seat church to a mere 10 parishioners (nine including clergy).

Kennedy, A Nation of Immigrants This quote aptly captures the history and essence of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn. Founded in 1853, the Diocese of Brooklyn sought to address the needs of the more than five million Irish Catholic immigrants who, tired and poor, arrived at the port of New York in search of a better life, many of whom settled in Brooklyn and Queens . Today, the Diocese of Brooklyn continues its vibrant and diverse history, home again to an immigrant population, this time driven by Hispanics . The Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn serves the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens . It is presided by the seventh and current Bishop of Brooklyn, His Excellency, the M2fil Reverend Nicholas DiMarzio , a champion of immigrant rights . The boroughs ' combined population stands at more than 4.9 million, of which 1.5 million identify themselves as Catholics . The diocesan cathedral is the Cathedral Basilica of St. James in downtown Brooklyn. The Co-Cathedral of St. Joseph in Prospect Heights was elevated in February 2013 by Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, and was dedicated on May 13, 2014, by Bishop DiMarzio . The faces of the people in the pews of St. Joseph's reflect the diversity of the many cultures that call the Diocese of Brooklyn home . It is also among the largest churches in Brooklyn and Queens. Due to its multicultural and diverse populations, Masses are regularly held in 33 different languages across the Diocese, throughout 186 parishes with 210 churches . Its 26 ethnic ministries promote cultural events and provide an opportunity for immigrants to belong to the larger community while preserving and sharing their uniqueness and Page ID# : 153 Within its borders is the seventh largest Catholic school network in the United States, with 85 elementary schools and academies that educate more than 27,000 students . Last year, the Diocese celebrated 15,885 Baptisms, 11,957 First Communions, 9,549 Confirmations and 1,951 Marriages, and had an average weekly attendance of almost 230,000 of the faithful at over 1,000 weekly Sunday Mass said in Brooklyn and Queens.

As of 23 January, China reported cases in 25 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities). Twenty five percent of confirmed cases reported by China have been classified by Chinese health authorities as seriously ill (from Wubei Province: (16% severely ill, 5% critically ill, and 4% having died). Currently, cases infected in China have been exported to the US, Thailand, Japan and Republic of Korea. It is expected that more cases will be exported to other countries, and that further transmission may occur. The initial source of 2019-nCoV still remains unknown. However, it is clear the growing outbreak is no longer due to ongoing exposures at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan; as in the last one week, less than 15% of new cases reported having visited Huanan market. There is now more evidence that 2019-nCoV spreads from human- to- human and also across generations of cases. Moreover, family clusters involving persons with no reported travel to Wuhan have been 1 2 ZIKA VIRUS Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) SITUATION REPORT - 3 23 JANUARY 2020 R.A. 64 tt 11\"1 I \"I t t .1 I \u00b7 t: ' {! . \u00b7 \u00b7 . 1 , ,ij? rganIzat1on The situation report includes information reported to WHO Geneva by 10 AM CET Severe illness: According to any of the following criteria : (1) dyspnea; (2) respiratory rate more than 30 bpm; (3) hypoxemia; (4) chest X-ray with multi-lobar infiltrates or pulmonary infiltration progressed more than SO% within 24 -48 hours. 38 2 reported from Guangdong Province.

R.A. 68Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-2 Filed 10/13/20 Page 5 PagelD #: 442 6 United States of America: On 7 January 2020, the US CDC established a 2019-nCoV Incident Management Structure. On 21 January 2020, US CDC activated its Emergency Response System to better provide ongoing support to the 2019-nCoV response. On 21 January 2020, US CDC again updated its interim travel health notice for persons traveling to Wuhan city, China. The travel notice was raised from Level 1; Practice Usual Precautions, to a Level 2: Practice Enhanced Precautions advising travellers that preliminary information suggests that older adults with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk for severe disease. CDC began entry screening of passengers on direct and connecting flights from Wuhan China to the 3 main ports of entry in the United States on 17 January 2020 and will expand the screening to Atlanta and Chicago in the coming days. CDC issued an updated interim Health Alert Notice (HAN) Advisory to inform state and local health departments and health care providers about this outbreak on 17 January 2020. A CDC team has deployed a team to support the ongoing investigation in the state of Washington in response to the first reported case of 2019-nCoV in the United States, including potentially tracing close contacts to determine if anyone else has become ill. CDC has developed a rRT-PCR test that can diagnose 2019-nCoV. IV. Statistical Modelling WHO is working with a number of mathematical model groups to better understand the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of this event. Phylogenetic analysis suggests based on 23 full genome sequences submitted to GISAID, that the sequences exhibit little genetic variation, which is indicative of a recent origin of the sampled and sequenced viruses. The sequenced genomes show no evidence of additional introductions of the virus from a non-human animal reservoir, although the numbers of sequences are limited at present. (Andrew Rambaut, University of Edinburgh, UK) Updated estimated number of cases in Wuhan based on baseline assumptions and alternative scenarios: a total of 4000 cases of 2019-nCoV in Wuhan City (uncertainty range: 1,000 9,700) had onset of symptoms by 18th January 2020 (Imai et al, https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan- coronavirus/ ) The median size of the Wuhan outbreak is estimated to be 4, 050 infections (95% CI: 1.700- 7, 950) by using an estimate of 10 days from exposure to detection and an effective population of 20 million people in Wuhan catchment as of January 20 (Matteo 7 PagelD #: 443 7 Resources: Technical interim guidance for novel coronavirus, WHO: https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus WHO travel advice for international travel and trade in relation to the outbreak of pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus in China: https://www.who.int/ith/2020- 0901_outbreak_of_Pneumonia_caused_by_a_new_coronavirus_in_C/en/Press statement by KCDC (in Press statement by KCDC (in Korean): https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&bid=0015&list_no=365805&act=view # Wuhan Municipal Health Commission's briefing on the pneumonia epidemic situation, (in Chinese): http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/list2nd/no/710 Disease outbreak news, Novel Coronavirus: https://www.who.int/csr/don/en/ Thailand Ministry of Public Health situation update on novel coronavirus (in Thai): https://ddc.moph.go.th/viralpneumonia/index.html Press statement by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan on 16 January 2020 (in Japanese): https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/newpage_08906.html Press statement by Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan on 6 January 2020 (in Japanese): https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/newpage_08767.html Notice sent out from Health and Food Safety Planning Division, Quarantine Station Operation Management Office (in Japanese): https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/10900000/000582967.pdf Situation report by WHO 70Case 444 R.A. 71(atJ>JD\\ World Health \\.J Organization \u00a9 Statement on the second meeting of the International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 30 January 2020 I Statement I Geneva, Switzerland The second meeting of the Emergency Committee convened by the WHO Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) regarding the outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 in the People's Republic of China, with exportations to other countries, took place on Thursday, 30 January 2020, from 13:30 to 18:35 Geneva time (CEST). The Committee's role is to give advice to the Director-General, who makes the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) . The Committee also provides public health advice or suggests formal Temporary Recommendations as appropriate . Proceedings of the meeting Members and advisors of the Emergency Committee were convened by teleconference The Director -General welcomed the Committee and thanked them for their support. He turned the meeting over to the Chair, Professor Didier Houssin. https://www .who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committ... 1/6 R.A. 72Professor Houssin also welcomed the Committee and gave the floor to the Secretariat. A representative of the department of compliance, risk management, and ethics briefed the Committee members on their roles and responsibilities . Committee members were reminded of their duty of confidentiality and their responsibility to disclose personal, financial, or professional connections that might be seen to constitute a conflict of interest. Each member who was present was surveyed and no conflicts of interest were judged to be relevant to the meeting. There were no changes since the previous meeting. The Chair then reviewed the agenda for the meeting and introduced the presenters . Representatives of the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China reported on the current situation and the public health measures being taken . There are now 7711 confirmed and 12167 suspected cases throughout the country. Of the confirmed cases, 1370 are severe and 170 people have died. 124 people have recovered and been discharged from hospital. The WHO Secretariat provided an overview of the situation in other countries . There are now 83 cases in 18 countries. Of these, only 7 had no history of travel in China. There has been human-to-human transmission in 3 countries outside China . One of these cases is severe and there have been no deaths . At its first meeting, the Committee expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a PHEIC or not. At that time, the advice was that the event did not constitute a PHEIC, but theCommittee members agreed on the urgency of the situation and suggested that the Committee should continue its meeting on the next day, when it reached the same conclusion . This second meeting takes place in view of significant increases in numbers of cases and additional countries reporting confirmed cases. Conclusions and advice The Committee welcomed the leadership and political commitment of the very highest levels of Chinese government, their commitment to transparency, and the efforts made to investigate and contain the current outbreak. China quickly identified the virus and shared its sequence, so that other countries could diagnose it quickly and protect themselves, which has resulted in the rapid development of diagnostic tools . https://www .who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committ... 2/6 R.A. 73The very strong measures the country has taken include daily contact with WHO and comprehensive multi-sectoral approaches to prevent further spread. It has also taken public health measures in other cities and provinces ; is conducting studies on the severity and transmissibility of the virus, and sharing data and biological material. The country has also agreed to work with other countries who need their support . The measures China has taken are good not only for that country but also for the rest of the world . The Committee acknowledged the leading role of WHO and its partners. The Committee also acknowledged that there are still many unknowns , cases have now been reported in five WHO regions in one month , and human-to-human transmission has occurred outside Wuhan and outside China. The Committee believes that it is still possible to interrupt virus spread, provided that countries put in place strong measures to detect disease early , isolate and treat cases , trace contacts , and promote social distancing measures commensurate with the risk. It is important to note that as the situation continues to evolve, so will the strategic goals and measures to prevent and reduce spread of the infection . The Committee agreed that the outbreak now meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and proposed the following advice to be issued as Temporary Recommendations . The Committee emphasized that the declaration of a PHEIC should be seen in the spirit of support and appreciation for China , its people, and the actions China has taken on the frontlines of this outbreak , with transparency, and, it is to be hoped, with success . In line with the need for global solidarity, the Committee felt that a global coord inated effort is needed to enhance preparedness in other regions of the world that may need additional support for that. Advice to WHO The Committee welcomed a forthcoming WHO multidisciplinary technical mission to China , including national and local experts. The mission should review and support efforts to investigate the animal source of the outbreak , the clinical spectrum of the disease and its severity, the extent of human-to- human transmission in the community and in healthcare facilities, and efforts to control the outbreak . This mission will provide information to the international community to aid in understanding the situation and its impact and enable sharing of experience and successful measures . The Committee wished to re-emphasize the importance of studying the possible source , to rule out hidden transmission and to inform risk management measures https://www .who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committ... 3/6 R.A. 74The Committee also emphasized the need for enhanced surveillance in regions outside Hubei, including pathogen genomic sequencing, to understand whether local cycles of transmission are occurring. WHO should continue to use its networks of technical experts to assess how best this outbreak can be contained globally. WHO should provide intensified support for preparation and response, especially in vulnerable countries and regions. Measures to ensure rapid development and access to potential vaccines, diagnostics, antiviral medicines and other therapeutics for low- and middle-income countries should be developed . WHO should continue to provide all necessary technical and operational support to respond to this outbreak, including with its extensive networks of partners and collaborating institutions, to implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy, and to allow for the advancement of research and scientific developments in relation to this novel coronavirus. WHO should continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert between the binary possibilities of PHEIC or no PHEIC, in a way that does not require reopening negotiations on the text of the IHR (2005) . WHO should timely review the situation with transparency and update its evidence-based recommendations. The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. The Director-General declared that the outbreak of 2019-nCoV constitutes a PHEIC and accepted the Committee's advice and issued this advice as Temporary Recommendations under the IHR. To the People's Republic of China Continue to: Implement a comprehensive risk communication strategy to regularly inform the population on the evolution of the outbreak, the prevention and protection measures for the population, and the response measures taken for its containment. https://www .who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committ... 4/6 R.A. 75 Enhance public health measures for containment of the current outbreak . Ensure the resilience of the health system and protect the health workforce. Enhance surveillance and active case finding across China . Collaborate with WHO and partners to conduct investigations to understand the epidemiology and the evolution of this outbreak and measures to contain it. Share relevant data on human cases . Continue to identify the zoonotic source of the outbreak, and particularly the potential for circulation with WHO as soon as it becomes available. Conduct exit screening at international airports and ports, with the aim of early detection of symptomatic travelers for further evaluation and treatment, while minimizing interference with international traffic. To all countries It is expected that further international exportation of cases may appear in any country. Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of 2019- nCoVinfection, and to share full data with WHO. Technical advice is available on the WHO website. Countries are reminded that they are legally required to share information with WHO under the IHR. Any detection of 2019-nCoV in an animal (including information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant epidemiological information) should be reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) as an emerging disease . Countries should place particular emphasis on reducing human infection, prevention of secondary transmission and international spread, and contributing to the international response though multi- sectoral communication and collaboration and active participation in increasing knowledge on the virus and the disease , as well as advancing research. The Committee does not recommend any travel or trade restriction based on the current information available. https://www .who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committ... 5/6 R.A. 76Countries must inform WHO about travel measures taken, as required by the IHR. Countries are cautioned against actions that promote stigma or discrimination, in line with the principles of Article 3 of the IHR. The Committee asked the Director-General to provide further advice on these matters and, if necessary, to make new case-by-case recommendations, in view of this rapidly evolving situation . To the global community As this is a new coronavirus, and it has been previously shown that similar coronaviruses required substantial efforts to enable regular information sharing and research, the global community should continue to demonstrate solidarity and cooperation, in compliance with Article 44 of the IHR (2005), in supporting each other on the identification of the source of this new virus, its full potential for human-to-human transmission, preparedness for potential importation of cases, and research for developing necessary treatment. Provide support to low- and middle-income countries to enable their response to this event, as well as to facilitate access to diagnostics, potential vaccines and therapeutics . Under Article 43 of the IHR, States Parties implementing additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic (refusal of entry or departure of international travellers, baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, and the like, or their delay, for more than 24 hours) are obliged to send to WHO the public health rationale and justification within 48 hours of their implementation. WHO will review the justification and may request countries to reconsider their measures . WHO is required to share with other States Parties the information about measures and the justification received . The Emergency Committee will be reconvened within three months or earlier, at the discretion of the Director-General. The Director-General thanked the Committee for its work to WHO Director-General's opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19 -11 March 2020 11 March 2020 Good afternoon . In the past two weeks, the number of cases of COVID-19 outside China has increased 13-fold, and the number of affected countries has tripled . There are now more than 118,000 cases in 114 countri es, and 4,291 people have lost their lives . Thousands more are fighting for their lives in hospitals. In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected countries climb even higher . WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity , and by the alarming levels of inaction . We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic. Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly . It is a word that, if misused , can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death . https://www .who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19-11-march -2020 1/4 R.A. 78Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO's assessment of the threat posed by this virus . It doesn't change what WHO is doing, and it doesn't change what countries should do. We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus . This is the first pandemic caused by a coronavirus. And we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled, at the same time. WHO has been in full response mode since we were notified of the first cases . And we have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear. As I said on Monday, just looking at the number of cases and the number of countries affected does not tell the full story. Of the 118,000 cases reported globally in 114 countries, more than 90 percent of cases are in just four countries, and two of those -China and the Republic of Korea -have significantly declining epidemics . 81 countries have not reported any cases, and 57 countries have reported 10 cases or less. We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough : all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace, and mobilize their people in the response, those with a handful of cases can prevent those cases becoming clusters, and those clusters becoming community transmission. Even those countries with community transmission or large clusters can turn the tide on this virus. Several countries have demonstrated that this virus can be suppressed and controlled . The challenge for many countries who are now dealing with large clusters or community transmission is not whether they can do the same -it's whether they will. Some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity . Some countries are struggling with a lack of resources . https://www .who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19-11-march -2020 2/4 R.A. 79Some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve . We are grateful for the measures being taken in Iran, Italy and the Republic of Korea to slow the virus and control their epidemics . We know that these measures are taking a heavy toll on societies and economies , just as they did in China. All countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimizing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights. WHO's mandate is public health. But we're working with many partners across all sectors to mitigate the social and economic consequences of this pandemic . This is not just a public health crisis , it is a crisis that will touch every sector -so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight. I have said from the beginning that countries must take a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach, built around a comprehensive strategy to prevent infections , save lives and minim ize impact. Let me summarize it in four key areas. First, prepare and be ready. Second, detect, protect and treat. Third, reduce transmission . Fourth , innovate and learn . I remind all countries that we are calling on you to activate and scale up your emergency response mechanisms ; Communicate with your people about the risks and how they can protect themselves -this is everybody 's business ; Find, isolate, test and treat every case and trace every contact ; Ready your hospitals ; Protect and train your health workers . https://www And let's all look out for each other, because we need each other .

The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d), in response to COVID-19. I have taken sweeping action to control the spread of the virus in the United States, including by suspending entry of foreign nationals seeking entry who had been physically present within the prior 14 days in certain jurisdictions where COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred, including the People's Republic of China, the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the Schengen Area of Europe. The Federal Government, along with State and local governments, has taken preventive and proactive measures to slow the spread of the virus and treat those affected, including by instituting Federal quarantines for individuals evacuated from foreign nations, issuing a declaration pursuant to section 319F-3 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d-6d), and releasing policies to accelerate the acquisition of personal protective equipment and streamline bringing new diagnostic capabilities to laboratories. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the COVID-19 outbreak can be characterized as a pandemic, as the rates of infection continue to rise in many locations around the world and across the United States. The spread of COVID -19 within our Nation's communities threatens to strain our Nation's healthcare systems. As of March 12, 2020, 1,645 people from 47 States have been infected with the virus that https ://www House causes COVID-19. It is incumbent on hospitals and medical facilities throughout the country to assess their preparedness posture and be prepared to surge capacity and capability. Additional measures, however, are needed to successfully contain and combat the virus in the United States. NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (SO U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) and consistent with section 1135 of the Social Security Act (SSA), as amended (42 U.S.C. 1320b-5), do hereby find and proclaim that the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States constitutes a national emergency, beginning March 1, 2020. Pursuant to this declaration, I direct as follows: Section 1. EmergencY. Authority.

Overview This scientific brief provides an overview of the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, what is known about when infected people transmit the virus, and the implications for infection prevention and control precautions within and outside health facilities. This scientific brief is not a systematic review. Rather, it reflects the consolidation of rapid reviews of publications in peer-reviewed journals and of non-peer-reviewed manuscripts on pre-print servers, undertaken by WHO and partners. Preprint findings should be interpreted with caution in the absence of peer review. This brief is also informed by several discussions via teleconferences with the WHO Health Emergencies Programme ad hoc Experts Advisory Panel for IPC Preparedness, Readiness and Response to COVID-19, the WHO ad hoc COVID-19 IPC Guidance Development Group (COVID-19 IPC GDG), and by review of external experts with relevant technical backgrounds. R.A. 84Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-6 Filed 10/13/20 World _He~lth ~'-' Orgamzat10n <#,kq#5353 The overarching aim of the global Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 (1) is to control COVID-19 by suppressing transmission of the virus and preventing associated illness and death. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is predominantly spread from person-to-person. Understanding how, when and in what types of settings SARS-CoV-2 spreads is critical to develop effective public health and infection prevention and control measures to break chains of transmission. Modes of transmission This section briefly describes possible modes of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, including contact, droplet, airborne, fomite, fecal-oral, bloodborne, mother-to-child, and animal-to-human transmission. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes respiratory illness ranging from mild disease to severe disease and death, and some people infected with the virus never develop symptoms. Contact and droplet transmission Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through infected secretions such as saliva and respiratory secretions or their respiratory droplets, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings.( 2-10)Respiratory droplets are >5-10 m in diameter whereas droplets <5m in diameter are referred to as droplet nuclei or aerosols. (11) Respiratory droplet transmission can occur when a person is in close contact (within 1 metre) with an infected person who has respiratory symptoms (e.g. coughing or sneezing) or who is talking or singing; in these circumstances, respiratory droplets that include virus can reach the mouth, nose or eyes of a susceptible person and can result in infection. Indirect contact transmission involving contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated object or surface (fomite transmission) may also be possible (see below). Airborne transmission Airborne transmission is defined as the spread of an infectious agent caused by the dissemination of droplet nuclei (aerosols) that remain infectious when suspended in air over long distances and time. (11) Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur during medical procedures that generate aerosols (\u0093aerosol generating procedures\u0094). (12)WHO, together with the scientific community, has been actively discussing and evaluating whether SARS-CoV-2 may also spread through aerosols in the absence of aerosol generating procedures, particularly in indoor settings with poor ventilation. R.A. 85Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-6 Filed 10/13/20 PagelD #: 459 \u00b5 - \u00b5 The physics of exhaled air and flow physics have generated hypotheses about possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through aerosols. (13-16) These theories suggest that 1) a number of respiratory droplets generate microscopic aerosols (<5 \u00b5m) by evaporating, and 2) normal breathing and talking results in exhaled aerosols. Thus, a susceptible person could inhale aerosols, and could become infected if the aerosols contain the virus in sufficient quantity to cause infection within the recipient. However, the proportion of exhaled droplet nuclei or of respiratory droplets that evaporate to generate aerosols, and the infectious dose of viable SARS-CoV-2 required to cause infection in another person are not known, but it has been studied for other respiratory viruses. (17) One experimental study quantified the amount of droplets of various sizes that remain airborne during normal speech. However, the authors acknowledge that this relies on the independent action hypothesis, which has not been validated for humans and SARS-CoV-2. (18) Another recent experimental model found that healthy individuals can produce aerosols through coughing and talking (19), and another model suggested high variability between individuals in terms of particle emission rates during speech, with increased rates correlated with increased amplitude of vocalization. (20) To date, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by this type of aerosol route has not been demonstrated; much more research is needed given the possible implications of such route of transmission. Experimental studies have generated aerosols of infectious samples using high-powered jet nebulizers under controlled laboratory conditions. These studies found SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA in air samples within aerosols for up to 3 hours in one study (21) and 16 hours in another, which also found viable replication-competent virus. (22) These findings were from experimentally induced aerosols that do not reflect normal human cough conditions. Some studies conducted in health care settings where symptomatic COVID-19 patients were cared for, but where aerosol generating procedures were not performed, reported the presence of SARS- CoV-2 RNA in air samples (23-28), while other similar investigations in both health care and non- health care settings found no presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA; no studies have found viable virus in air samples. (29-36) Within samples where SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found, the quantity of RNA detected was in extremely low numbers in large volumes of air and one study that found SARS-CoV- 2 RNA in air samples reported inability to identify viable virus. (25) The detection of RNA using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assays is not necessarily indicative of replication- and infection-competent (viable) virus that could be transmissible and capable of causing infection. (37) Recent clinical reports of health workers exposed to COVID-19 index cases, not in the presence of aerosol-generating procedures, found no nosocomial transmission when contact and droplet precautions were appropriately used, including the wearing of medical masks as a component of the R.A. 86Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-6 Filed 10/13/20 Page 3 of 21 PagelD #: 460 personal protective equipment (PPE). (38, 39) These observations suggest that aerosol transmission did not occur in this context. Further studies are needed to determine whether it is possible to detect viable SARS-CoV-2 in air samples from settings where no procedures that generate aerosols are performed and what role aerosols might play in transmission. Outside of medical facilities, some outbreak reports related to indoor crowded spaces (40) have suggested the possibility of aerosol transmission, combined with droplet transmission, for example, during choir practice (7), in restaurants (41) or in fitness classes. (42) In these events, short-range aerosol transmission, particularly in specific indoor locations, such as crowded and inadequately ventilated spaces over a prolonged period of time with infected persons cannot be ruled out. However, the detailed investigations of these clusters suggest that droplet and fomite transmission could also explain human-to-human transmission within these clusters. Further, the close contact environments of these clusters may have facilitated transmission from a small number of cases to many other people (e.g., superspreading event), especially if hand hygiene was not performed and masks were not used when physical distancing was not maintained. (43) Fomite transmission Respiratory secretions or droplets expelled by infected individuals can contaminate surfaces and objects, creating fomites (contaminated surfaces). Viable SARS-CoV-2 virus and/or RNA detected by RT-PCR can be found on those surfaces for periods ranging from hours to days, depending on the ambient environment (including temperature and humidity) and the type of surface, in particular at high concentration in health care facilities where COVID-19 patients were being treated. (21, 23, 24, 26, 28, 31-33 , 36, 44, 45)Therefore, transmission may also occur indirectly through touching surfaces in the immediate environment or objects contaminated with virus from an infected person (e.g. stethoscope or thermometer), followed by touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Despite consistent evidence as to SARS-CoV-2 contamination of surfaces and the survival of the virus on certain surfaces, there are no specific reports which have directly demonstrated fomite transmission. People who come into contact with potentially infectious surfaces often also have close contact with the infectious person, making the distinction between respiratory droplet and fomite transmission difficult to discern. However, fomite transmission is considered a likely mode of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, given consistent findings about environmental contamination in the vicinity of infected cases and the fact that other coronaviruses and respiratory viruses can transmit this way. R.A. 87Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-6 Filed 10/13/20 Page 4 PagelD #: 461 Other modes of transmission SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in other biological samples, including the urine and feces of some patients. (46-50 )One study found viable SARS-CoV-2 in the urine of one patient. (51)Three studies have cultured SARS-CoV-2 from stool specimens. (48, 52, 53) To date, however, there have been no published reports of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through feces or urine. Some studies have reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, in either plasma or serum, and the virus can replicate in blood cells. However, the role of bloodborne transmission remains uncertain; and low viral titers in plasma and serum suggest that the risk of transmission through this route may be low. (48, 54) Currently, there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected pregnant women to their fetuses, although data remain limited. WHO has recently published a scientific brief on breastfeeding and COVID-19. (55)This brief explains that viral RNA fragments have been found by RT-PCR testing in a few breast milk samples of mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2, but studies investigating whether the virus could be isolated, have found no viable virus. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mother to child would necessitate replicative and infectious virus in breast milk being able to reach target sites in the infant and also to overcome infant defense systems. WHO recommends that mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be encouraged to initiate or continue to breastfeed. (55) Evidence to date shows that SARS-CoV-2 is most closely related to known betacoronaviruses in bats; the role of an intermediate host in facilitating transmission in the earliest known human cases remains unclear. (56, 57) In addition to investigations on the possible intermediate host(s) of SARS- CoV-2, there are also a number of studies underway to better understand susceptibility of SARS- CoV-2 in different animal species. Current evidence suggests that humans infected with SARS-CoV-2 can infect other mammals, including dogs (58), cats (59), and farmed mink. (60) However, it remains unclear if these infected mammals pose a significant risk for transmission to humans. When do people infected with SARS-CoV-2 infect others? Knowing when an infected person can spread SARS-CoV-2 is just as important as how the virus spreads (described above). WHO has recently published a scientific brief outlining what is known about when a person may be able to spread, based on the severity of their illness. (61) R.A. 88Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-6 Filed 10/13/20 Page 5 of 21 PagelD #: 462 In brief, evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in people 1-3 days before their symptom onset, with the highest viral loads, as measured by RT-PCR, observed around the day of symptom onset, followed by a gradual decline over time. (47, 62-65 ) The duration of RT-PCR positivity generally appears to be 1-2 weeks for asymptomatic persons, and up to 3 weeks or more for patients with mild to moderate disease. (62, 65-68 ) In patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it can be much longer. (47) Detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that a person is infectious and able to transmit the virus to another person. Studies using viral culture of patient samples to assess the presence of infectious SARS-CoV-2 are currently limited. (61) Briefly, viable virus has been isolated from an asymptomatic case, (69) from patients with mild to moderate disease up to 8-9 days after symptom onset, and for longer from severely ill patients. (61) Full details about the duration of viral shedding can be found in the WHO guidance document on \u0093Criteria for releasing COVID-19 patients from isolation\u0094. (61) Additional studies are needed to determine the duration of viable virus shedding among infected patients. SARS-CoV-2 infected persons who have symptoms can infect others primarily through droplets and close contact SARS-CoV-2 transmission appears to mainly be spread via droplets and close contact with infected symptomatic cases. In an analysis of 75,465 COVID-19 cases in China, 78-85% of clusters occurred within household settings, suggesting that transmission occurs during close and prolonged contact. (6) A study of the first patients in the Republic of Korea showed that 9 of 13 secondary cases occurred among household contacts. (70) Outside of the household setting, those who had close physical contact, shared meals, or were in enclosed spaces for approximately one hour or more with symptomatic cases, such as in places of worship, gyms, or the workplace, were also at increased risk of infection. (7, 42, 71, 72)Other reports have supported this with similar findings of secondary transmission within families in other countries. (73, 74) SARS-CoV-2 infected persons without symptoms can also infect others Early data from China suggested that people without symptoms could infect others. (6) To better understand the role of transmission from infected people without symptoms, it is important to distinguish between transmission from people who are infected who never develop symptoms (75) R.A. 89Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-6 PagelD #: 463 (asymptomatic transmission) and transmission from people who are infected but have not developed symptoms yet (pre-symptomatic transmission). This distinction is important when developing public health strategies to control transmission. The extent of truly asymptomatic infection in the community remains unknown. The proportion of people whose infection is asymptomatic likely varies with age due to the increasing prevalence of underlying conditions in older age groups (and thus increasing risk of developing severe disease with increasing age), and studies that show that children are less likely to show clinical symptoms compared to adults. (76) Early studies from the United States (77) and China (78) reported that many cases were asymptomatic, based on the lack of symptoms at the time of testing; however, 75-100% of these people later developed symptoms. A recent systematic review estimated that the proportion of truly asymptomatic cases ranges from 6% to 41%, with a pooled estimate of 16% (12%\u009620%). (79) However, all studies included in this systematic review have important limitations. (79) For example, some studies did not clearly describe how they followed up with persons who were asymptomatic at the time of testing to ascertain if they ever developed symptoms, and others defined \u0093asymptomatic\u0094 very narrowly as persons who never developed fever or respiratory symptoms, rather than as those who did not develop any symptoms at all. (76, 80) A recent study from China that clearly and appropriately defined asymptomatic infections suggests that the proportion of infected people who never developed symptoms was 23%. (81) Multiple studies have shown that people infect others before they themselves became ill, (10, 42, 69, 82, 83) which is supported by available viral shedding data (see above). One study of transmission in Singapore reported that 6.4% of secondary cases resulted from pre-symptomatic transmission. (73) One modelling study, that inferred the date of transmission based on the estimated serial interval and incubation period, estimated that up to 44% (25-69%) of transmission may have occurred just before symptoms appeared. (62) It remains unclear why the magnitude of estimates from modelling studies differs from available empirical data. Transmission from infected people without symptoms is difficult to study. However, information can be gathered from detailed contact tracing efforts, as well as epidemiologic investigations among cases and contacts. Information from contact tracing efforts reported to WHO by Member States, available transmission studies and a recent pre-print systematic reviews suggests that individuals without symptoms are less likely to transmit the virus than those who develop symptoms. (10, 81, 84, 85) Four individual studies from Brunei, Guangzhou China, Taiwan China and the Republic of Korea found that between 0% and 2.2% of people with asymptomatic infection infected anyone else, compared to 0.8%-15.4% of people with symptoms. (10, 72, 86, 87) R.A. 90Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-6 Filed 10/13/20 Page 7 of 21 PagelD #: 464 Remaining questions related to transmission Many unanswered questions about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remain, and research seeking to answer those questions is ongoing and is encouraged. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted between people via respiratory droplets and contact routes \u0096 although aerosolization in medical settings where aerosol generating procedures are used is also another possible mode of transmission - and that transmission of COVID-19 is occurring from people who are pre-symptomatic or symptomatic to others in close contact (direct physical or face-to-face contact with a probable or confirmed case within one meter and for prolonged periods of time), when not wearing appropriate PPE. Transmission can also occur from people who are infected and remain asymptomatic, but the extent to which this occurs is not fully understood and requires further research as an urgent priority. The role and extent of airborne transmission outside of health care facilities, and in particular in close settings with poor ventilation, also requires further study. As research continues, we expect to gain a better understanding about the relative importance of different transmission routes, including through droplets, physical contact and fomites; the role of airborne transmission in the absence of aerosol generating procedures; the dose of virus required for transmission to occur, the characteristics of people and situations that facilitate superspreading events such as those observed in various closed settings, the proportion of infected people who remain asymptomatic throughout the course of their infection; the proportion of truly asymptomatic persons who transmit the virus to others; the specific factors that drive asymptomatic and pre- symptomatic transmission; and the proportion of all infections that are transmitted from asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Implications for preventing transmission Understanding how, when and in which settings infected people transmit the virus is important for developing and implementing control measures to break chains of transmission. While there is a great deal of scientific studies becoming available, all studies that investigate transmission should be interpreted bearing in mind the context and settings in which they took place, including the infection prevention interventions in place, the rigor of the methods used in the investigation and the limitations and biases of the study designs. It is clear from available evidence and experience, that limiting close contact between infected people and others is central to breaking chains of transmission of the virus causing COVID-19. The prevention of transmission is best achieved by identifying suspect cases as quickly as possible, testing, and isolating infectious cases. (88, 89) In addition, it is critical to identify all close contacts of infected people (88) so that they can be quarantined (90) to limit onward spread and break chains of R.A. 91Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-6 Filed 10/13/20 Page 8 of 21 PagelD #: 465 transmission. By quarantining close contacts, potential secondary cases will already be separated from others before they develop symptoms or they start shedding virus if they are infected, thus preventing the opportunity for further onward spread. The incubation period of COVID-19, which is the time between exposure to the virus and symptom onset, is on average 5-6 days, but can be as long as 14 days. (82, 91) Thus, quarantine should be in place for 14 days from the last exposure to a confirmed case. If it is not possible for a contact to quarantine in a separate living space, self- quarantine for 14 days at home is required; those in self-quarantine may require support during the use of physical distancing measures to prevent the spread of the virus. Given that infected people without symptoms can transmit the virus, it is also prudent to encourage the use of fabric face masks in public places where there is community transmission [1] and where other prevention measures, such as physical distancing, are not possible. (12) Fabric masks, if made and worn properly, can serve as a barrier to droplets expelled from the wearer into the air and environment. (12) However, masks must be used as part of a comprehensive package of preventive measures, which includes frequent hand hygiene, physical distancing when possible, respiratory etiquette, environmental cleaning and disinfection. Recommended precautions also include avoiding indoor crowded gatherings as much as possible, in particular when physical distancing is not feasible, and ensuring good environmental ventilation in any closed setting. (92, 93) Within health care facilities, including long term care facilities, based on the evidence and the advice by the COVID-19 IPC GDG, WHO continues to recommend droplet and contact precautions when caring for COVID-19 patients and airborne precautions when and where aerosol generating procedures are performed. WHO also recommends standard or transmission-based precautions for other patients using an approach guided by risk assessment. (94) These recommendations are consistent with other national and international guidelines, including those developed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine (95) and by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. (96) Furthermore, in areas with COVID-19 community transmission, WHO advises that health workers and caregivers working in clinical areas should continuously wear a medical mask during all routine activities throughout the entire shift. (12)In settings where aerosol-generating procedures are performed, they should wear an N95, FFP2 or FFP3 respirator. Other countries and organizations, including the United States Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (97) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (98)recommend airborne precautions for any situation involving the care of COVID-19 patients. However, they also consider the use of medical masks as an acceptable option in case of shortages of respirators. R.A. 92Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-6 Filed 10/13/20 Page 9 of 21 PagelD #: 466 WHO guidance also emphasizes the importance of administrative and engineering controls in health care settings, as well as rational and appropriate use of all PPE (99) and training for staff on these recommendations (IPC for Novel Coronavirus [COVID-19] Course. Geneva; World Health Organization 2020, available at (https://openwho.org/courses/COVID-19-IPC-EN). WHO has also provided guidance on safe workplaces. (92) Key points of the brief Main findings \u0095 Understanding how, when and in what types of settings SARS-CoV-2 spreads between people is critical to develop effective public health and infection prevention measures to break chains of transmission. \u0095 Current evidence suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs primarily between people through direct, indirect, or close contact with infected people through infected secretions such as saliva and respiratory secretions, or through their respiratory droplets, which are expelled when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks or sings. \u0095 Airborne transmission of the virus can occur in health care settings where specific medical procedures, called aerosol generating procedures, generate very small droplets called aerosols. Some outbreak reports related to indoor crowded spaces have suggested the possibility of aerosol transmission, combined with droplet transmission, for example, during choir practice, in restaurants or in fitness classes. \u0095 Respiratory droplets from infected individuals can also land on objects, creating fomites (contaminated surfaces). As environmental contamination has been documented by many reports, it is likely that people can also be infected by touching these surfaces and touching their eyes, nose or mouth before cleaning their hands. \u0095 Based on what we currently know, transmission of COVID-19 is primarily occurring from people when they have symptoms, and can also occur just before they develop symptoms, when they are in close proximity to others for prolonged periods of time. While someone who never develops symptoms can also pass the virus to others, it is still not clear to what extent this occurs and more research is needed in this area. \u0095 Urgent high-quality research is needed to elucidate the relative importance of different transmission routes; the role of airborne transmission in the absence of aerosol generating procedures; the dose of virus required for transmission to occur; the settings and risk factors for superspreading events; and the extent of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. How to prevent transmission The overarching aim of the Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 (1) is to control COVID-19 by suppressing transmission of the virus and preventing associated illness and death. To the best of our understanding, the virus is primarily spread through contact and respiratory droplets. Under some circumstances airborne transmission may occur (such as when aerosol generating R.A. 93Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG -CLP 10 of 21 PagelD #: 467 procedures are conducted in health care settings or potentially, in indoor crowded poorly ventilated settings elsewhere). More studies are urgently needed to investigate such instances and assess their actual significance for transmission of COVID-19. To prevent transmission, WHO recommends a comprehensive set of measures including: \u0095 Identify suspect cases as quickly as possible, test, and isolate all cases (infected people) in appropriate facilities; \u0095 Identify and quarantine all close contacts of infected people and test those who develop symptoms so that they can be isolated if they are infected and require care; \u0095 Use fabric masks in specific situations, for example, in public places where there is community transmission and where other prevention measures, such as physical distancing, are not possible; \u0095 Use of contact and droplet precautions by health workers caring for suspected and confirmed COVID- 19 patients, and use of airborne precautions when aerosol generating procedures are performed; \u0095 Continuous use of a medical mask by health workers and caregivers working in all clinical areas, during all routine activities throughout the entire shift; \u0095 At all times, practice frequent hand hygiene, physical distancing from others when possible, and respiratory etiquette; avoid crowded places, close-contact settings and confined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation; wear fabric masks when in closed, overcrowded spaces to protect others; and ensure good environmental ventilation in all closed settings and appropriate environmental cleaning and disinfection. WHO carefully monitors the emerging evidence about this critical topic and will update this scientific brief as more information becomes available.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Cleaning and Disinfection for Households Detailed Disinfection Guidance IMHM Interim Recommendations for U.S. Households with Suspected or Confirmed Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Updated July 10, 2020 Print Summary of Recent Changes Revisions were made on 3/26/2020 to reflect the following: Updated links to EPA-registered disinfectant list Added guidance for disinfection of electronics Updated core disinfection/cleaning guidance Background There is much to learn about the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) . Based on what is currently known about COVID-19, spread from person-to-person of this virus happens most frequently among close contacts (within about 6 feet). This type of transmission occurs via respiratory droplets. On the other hand, transmission of novel coronavirus to persons from surfaces contaminated with the virus has not been documented. Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. Transmission of coronavirus occurs much more commonly through respiratory droplets than through objects and surfaces, like doorknobs, countertops , keyboards, toys, etc. Current evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may remain viable for hours to days on surfaces made from a variety of materials. Cleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection is a best practice measure for prevention of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory illnesses in households and community settings . It is unknown how long the air inside a room occupied by someone with confirmed COVID-19 remains potentially infectious. Facilities will need to consider factors such as the size of the room and the ventilation system design (including flowrate [air changes per hour] and location of supply and exhaust vents) when deciding how long to close off rooms or areas used by ill persons before beginning disinfection . Taking measures to improve ventilation in an area or room where someone was ill or suspected to be ill with COVID-19 will help shorten the time it takes respiratory droplets to be removed from the air. Purpose This guidance provides recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of households where persons under investigation (PUI) or those with confirmed COVID-19 reside or may be in self- isolation . It is aimed at limiting the survival of the virus in the environments. These recommendations will be updated if additional information becomes available. These guidelines are focused on household settings and are meant for the general public. Cleaning refers to the removal of germs, dirt, and impurities from surfaces. It does not kill germs, but by removing them, it lowers their numbers and the risk of spreading infection . Disinfecting refers to using chemicals, for example, EPA-registered disinfectants, to kill germs on surfaces. This process does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs, but by killing germs on a surface after cleaning, it can further lower the risk of spreading infection. https ://www. 4 PagelD #: 480 General recommendations for routine cleaning and disinfection of households Community members can practice routine cleaning of frequently touched surfaces {for example : tables, doorknobs, light switches , handles, desks , toilets, faucets, sinks , and electronics {see below for special electronics cleaning and disinfection instructions)) with household cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants B that are appropriate for the surface, following label instructions . Labels conta in instructions for safe and effective use of the cleaning product including precautions you should take when applying the product, such as wearing gloves and making sure you have good ventilation during use of the product . o For electronics follow the manufacturer's instructions for all cleaning and disinfection products. Consider use of wipeable covers for electronics . If no manufacturer guidance is available, consider the use of alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at least 70% alcohol to disinfect touch screens. Dry surfaces thoroughly to avoid pooling of liquids. General recommendations for cleaning and disinfection of households with people isolated in home care ( e.g. suspected/confirmed to have COVID-19) Household members should educate themselves about COVID-19 symptoms and preventing the spread of COVID-19 in homes . Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily in household common areas (e.g. tables, hard-backed chairs, doorknobs, light switches , phones, tablets, touch screens, remote controls, keyboards, handles, desks, toilets , sinks) o In the bedroom/bathroom dedicated for an ill person : consider reducing cleaning frequency to as-needed {e.g., soiled items and surfaces) to avoid unnecessary contact with the ill person. As much as possible, an ill person should stay in a specific room and away from other people in their home, following home care guidance . The caregiver can provide personal cleaning supplies for an ill person 's room and bathroom, unless the room is occupied by child or another person for whom such supplies would not be appropriate . These suppl ies include tissues , paper towels, cleaners and EPA-registered disinfectants {see examples B ). If a separate bathroom is not available, the bathroom should be cleaned and disinfected after each use by an ill person . If this is not possible , the caregiver should wait as long as practical after use by an ill person to clean and disinfect the high-touch surfaces . Household members should follow home care guidance when interacting with persons with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 and their isolation rooms/bathrooms. How to clean and disinfect Hard (Non-porous) Surfaces Wear disposable gloves when cleaning and disinfecting surfaces. Gloves should be discarded after each cleaning. If reusable gloves are used, those gloves should be dedicated for cleaning and disinfection of surfaces for COVID-19 and should not be used for other purposes. Consult the manufacturer's instructions for cleaning and disinfection products used . Clean hands immediately after gloves are removed . If surfaces are dirty, they should be cleaned using a detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection .

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Social Distancing Social Distancing Keep a Safe Distance to Slow the Spread. Updated July 15, 2020 Print IMHM Limiting close face-to-face contact with others is the best way to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). What is social distancing? Social distancing, also called \"physical distancing,\" means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household. To practice social or physical distancing , stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms' length) from other people who are not from your household in both indoor and outdoor spaces . Social distancing should be practiced in combination with other everyday preventive actions to reduce the spread of COVID - 19, including wearing cloth face coverings , avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands, and frequently washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds . Why practice social distancing? COVID-19 spreads mainly among people who are in close contact (within about 6 feet) for a prolonged period . Spread happens when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, and droplets from their mouth or nose are launched into the air and land in the mouths or noses of people nearby . The droplets can also be inhaled into the lungs . Recent studies indicate that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19 . Since people can spread the virus before they know they are sick, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from others when possible, even if you-or they-do not have any symptoms . Social distancing is especially important for people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 . If you are sick with COVID -19, have symptoms consistent with COVID-19 , or have been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, it is important to stay home and away from other people until it is safe to be around others . COVID-19 can live for hours or days on a surface, depending on factors such as sunlight , humidity , and the type of surface . It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth , nose, or eyes. However, this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads . Social distancing helps limit opportunities to come in contact with contaminated surfaces and infected people outside the home . Although the risk of severe illness may be different for everyone , anyone can get and spread COVID -19. Everyone has a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting themselves, their family, and their community . In addition to practicing everyday steps to prevent COVID-19 , keeping space between you and others is one of the best tools we have to avoid being exposed to this virus and slowing its spread in communities. Tips for Social Distancing When going out in public, it is important to stay at least 6 feet away from other people and wear a cloth face covering to slow the spread of COVID-19. Consider the following tips for practicing social distancing when you decide to go out. Know Before You Go: Before going out, know and follow the guidance from local public health authorities where you live. https://www. cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nco #: 484 Prepare for Transportation: Consider social distancing options to travel safely when running errands or commuting to and from work, whether walking, bicycling, wheelchair rolling , or using public transit, rideshares, or taxis. When using public transit, try to keep at least 6 feet from other passengers or transit operators -for example, when you are waiting at a bus station or selecting seats on a bus or train. When using rideshares or taxis, avoid pooled rides where multiple passengers are picked up, and sit in the back seat in larger vehicles so you can remain at least 6 feet away from the driver. Follow these additional tips to protect yourself while using transportation . Limit Contact When Running Errands : Only visit stores selling household essentials in person when you absolutely need to, and stay at least 6 feet away from others who are not from your household while shopping and in lines. If possible, use drive-thru, curbside pick-up, or delivery services to limit face-to-face contact with others. Maintain physical distance between yourself and delivery service providers during exchanges and wear a cloth face covering . Choose Safe Social Activities :lt is possible to stay socially connected with friends and family who don't live in your home by calling, using video chat, or staying connected through social media. If meeting others in person (e.g., at small outdoor gatherings, yard or driveway gathering with a small group of friends or family members), stay at least 6 feet from others who are not from your household . Follow these steps to stay safe if you will be participating in personal and social activities outside of your home. Keep Distance at Events and Gatherings : It is safest to avoid crowded places and gatherings where it may be difficult to stay at least 6 feet away from others who are not from your household . If you are in a crowded space , try to keep 6 feet of space between yourself and others at all times, and wear a cloth face covering . Cloth face coverings are especially important in times when physical distancing is difficult. Pay attention to any physical guides, such as tape markings on floors or signs on walls, directing attendees to remain at least 6 feet apart from each other in lines or at other times. Allow other people 6 feet of space when you pass by them in both indoor and outdoor settings . Stay Distanced While Being Active : Consider going for a walk, bike ride, or wheelchair roll in your neighborhood or in another safe location where you can maintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and other pedestrians and cyclists. If you decide to visit a nearby park, trail, or recreational facility , first check for closures or restrictions. If open, consider how many other people might be there and choose a location where it will be possible to keep at least 6 feet of space between yourself and other people who are not from your household . Many people have personal circumstances or situations that present challenges with practicing social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

How 'Superspreading' Events Drive Most COVID-19 Spread - Scientific American https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-superspreading-events-drive-most-covid-19-spread1/?print=true[8/5/2020 3:05:45 PM]PUBLIC HEALTH How 'Superspreading' Events Drive Most COVID-19 Spread By In late February about 175 executives from around the world came to the biotechnology company Biogen's leadership conference in Boston. Over two days, attendees shook hands, talked among themselves and shared meals. Also in attendance: the new coronavirus. Several people at the event were unknowingly infected with the microbe that causes COVID-19, and it quickly spread among others there, who then brought it home. At least 99 people ended up sick in Massachusetts alone. R.A. 136Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-20 Filed 10/13/20 Page 1 of 6 PagelD #: 510 As few as 10 percent of infected people may drive a whopping 80 percent of cases in specific types of situations Christie Aschwanden on June 23, 2020 Credit: Getty Images How 'Superspreading' Events Drive Most COVID-19 Spread - Scientific American https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-superspreading-events-drive-most-covid-19-spread1/?print=true[8/5/2020 3:05:45 PM]Around the same time, the coronavirus was spreading among more than 100 people who went to a funeral in Albany, Ga. sparking an outbreak that soon led to the surrounding rural county posting one of the nation's highest cumulative incidences of COVID-19. The next month a single individual with the disease infected 52 people during a two-and-a-half-hour choir practice in Washington State. Two people died. In Arkansas, an infected pastor and his wife passed the virus on to more than 30 attendees at church events over the course of a few days, leading to at least three deaths. And these new cases spread to 26 more people, at least one of whom died. As scientists have learned more about COVID-19, it has become clear that so-called superspreader incidents\u2014in which one person infects a disproportionate number of other individuals\u2014have played an oversized role in the transmission of the virus that causes the disease. The Boston conference and the funeral in Georgia were among several superspreader events that played \"a notable role in the early U.S. spread of COVID-19 ,\" according to a report by Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In fact, research on actual cases , as well as models of the pandemic, indicate that between 10 and 20 percent of infected people are responsible for 80 percent of the coronavirus's spread. These numbers mean that preventing superspreader events could go a long way toward stopping COVID-19, says Samuel Scarpino, a network scientist who studies infectious disease at Current evidence suggests that it is mostly circumstances such as these, rather than the biology of When describing how the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads, epidemiologists not only use the average number of other people that one individual infects but also employ another key value called theADVERTISEMENT R.A. 137Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-20 Filed 10/13/20 Page 2 of 6 PagelD #: 511 Northeastern University. Scientists have identified factors that catalyze such events, including large crowd sizes, close contact between people and confined spaces with poor ventilation. specific individuals, that sets the stage for extreme spreading of the novel coronavirus.

A small k generally means that a relatively small number of cases are responsible for transmissions, while a larger k indicates that transmissions are more evenly spread. In Hong Kong, researchers calculated that in more than 1,000 COVID-19 cases they examined, the value for k was 0.45. That value was higher than that of SARS or MERS\u2014two previous viral outbreaks that featured superspreading\u2014but as reliant on superspreading as SARS and MERS were but is far more dependent on it than The novel coronavirus seems to primarily spread via respiratory droplets produced by an infected individual during coughing, sneezing, talking or breathing. The next person becomes infected by inhaling these droplets into his or her lungs or by getting them in the nose or mouth. If people got sick right away after they were infected, they might stay at home in bed, giving them few opportunities to transmit the virus. Instead individuals with COVID-19 are contagious before they have symptoms, says Lauren Ancel Meyers, executive director of the University of Texas at Austin COVID-19 Modeling Consortium . The CDC estimates that about 40 percent of transmissions occur before the infected person has any symptoms and that symptoms take an average of six days to begin. That time gives an infected individual a long window to come into contact with other people\u2014and to perhaps get into a situation ripe for superspreading. Some of them are environmental. For instance, poorly ventilated indoor areas seem especially conducive to the virus's spread. A preliminary analysis of 110 COVID-19 cases in Japan found that the odds of transmitting the pathogen in a closed environment was more than 18 times greater than in an open-air space superspreader events. (The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.) Another preliminary preprint study, by researchers in London, examined clusters of COVID-19 cases and found that nearly all of them were indoor or indoor-outdoor settings . The largest clusters were found in indoor spaces such as nursing homes, churches, food-processing plants, schools, shopping areas, worker dormitories, prisons and ships. Unsurprisingly, another thing these superspreader venues have in common is that they are places R.A. 138Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-20 Filed 10/13/20 Page 3 of 6 PagelD #: 512 much lower than that of the 1918 flu pandemic. In other words, SARS-CoV-2 's transmission is not influenza, Scarpino says. Researchers have identified several factors that make it easier for superspreading to happen . \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7- \u00b7 And the authors concluded that confined spaces could promote How 'Superspreading' Events Drive Most COVID-19 Spread - Scientific American https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-superspreading-events-drive-most-covid-19-spread1/?print=true[8/5/2020 3:05:45 PM]where large numbers of people congregate. The more individuals you pile into one place, the greater the opportunity for the coronavirus to infect many people at once, Meyers says. \"If you group's size increases, so does the risk of transmitting the virus to a wider cluster. A large group size also increases the chance that someone present will be infectious. Time matters too. The longer a group stays in contact, the greater the likelihood that the virus will spread among them. Exactly how much time someone needs to pick it up remains an unanswered question, says Syra Madad, a special pathogens expert at NYC Health + Hospitals. She adds that the benchmark used for risk assessment in her contact-tracing work is 10 minutes of contact with an infectious person, though the CDC uses 15 minutes as a guideline. Essential workers such as grocery store checkers and nursing home employees interact with large groups by necessity and work in situations primed for superpreading. Meyers says that if we want to contain COVID-19, What people are doing matters, too, because some activities seem to make it easier to spread when you talk, you emit a \"tremendous amount\" of particles, says University of California, Davis, chemical engineer William Ristenpart. \"Nobody thinks about them, but they're there,\" he says. Ristenpart's team has found that speech emits more particles than normal breathing. And emissions also increase as people speak louder. Singing emits even more particles, which may partially explain the superspreader event at the Washington State choir practice. Breathing hard during exercise might also help the spread of COVID-19. Fitness dance classes held in small rooms with up to 22 students at a time were linked to 65 cases of the disease in South Korea . But yoga classes at one of the same facilities were not linked to any clusters. A study of COVID-19 clusters in Japan found cases connected to exercising in gyms, karaoke parties, cheering at clubs and holding conversations in bars , providing further evidence that these activities may aidADVERTISEMENT R.A. 139Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-20 Filed 10/13/20 Page 4 of 6 PagelD #: 513 max out at five people, it will be very hard to have a superspreading event,\" she adds.

The scientists also have found intriguing evidence that a small subset of people may behave as \"speech superemitters\"\u2014 individuals who consistently broadcast an order of magnitude more respiratory particles than says. \"One of the superemitters was a very petite young woman. And I was a bigger, bulkier guy and was not a superemitter.\" The evidence about superspreading activities has led researchers to believe they are responsible for much of the new coronavirus's transmission. \"All of the data I'm seeing so far suggest that if you tamp down the superspreader events, the growth rate of the infections stops very, very quickly,\" Scarpino says. \"We saw in Seattle that there were at least a couple of introductions that did not lead to new cases\"\u2014implying that the virus can fade out if it is denied circumstances for spreading. But in the U.S.\u2014where there have been nearly 2.16 million cases and more than 117,000 deaths\u2014 those situations may be on the rise. States are reopening businesses and activities, which means more people are coming in contact with one another in larger groups. So minimizing conditions that allow superspreading events to happen will be crucial for keeping COVID-19 in check. In advised people to avoid situations with the three C's : closed spaces with poor ventilation, crowded spaces and close-contact settings.

What is added by this report? Among 92 attendees at a rural Arkansas church during March 6-11, 35 (38%) developed laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, and three persons died. Highest attack rates were in persons aged 19-64 years (59%) and ,!:65 years (50%) . An additional 26 cases linked to the church occurred in the community , including one death. What are the implications for public health practice? Faith-based organizations should work with local health officials to determine how to implement the U.S. Government guidelines for modifying activities during the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent transmission of the virus to their members and their communities. PRIMARY CASES CHURCH CASES COMMUNITY no A D D 2 symptomatic people At least 3S of 92 From contact with attended church events attendees acquired church cases , at least March 6-8, later tested COVID -19, 3 deaths 26 additiona l cases positive for COVID-19 were confirmed , 1 death CDC.GOV bit.l~/MMWA0Sl920 - On March 16, 2020, the day that national social distancing guidelines were released ( 1), the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) was notified of two cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from a rural county of approximately 25,000 persons; these cases were the first identified in this county.

The couple (the index cases) attended church-related events during March 6-8, and developed nonspecific respiratory symptoms and fever on March 10 (wife) and 11 (husband) . Before his symptoms had developed, the husband attended a Bible study group on March 11. Including the index cases, 35 confirmed COVID-19 cases occurred among 92 (38%) persons who attended events held at church A during March 6-11; three patients died. The age- specific attack rates among persons aged s 18 years, 19-64 years, and ,!:65 years were 6.3%, 59.4%, and 50.0%, respectively. During contact tracing . at least 26 additional oersons with confirmed COVID-19 cases identified among members who reported contact with church A attendees and likely were infected by them; one of the additional persons was hospitalized and subsequently died. This outbreak highlights the potential for widespread transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID -19, both at group gatherings during church events and within the broader community . These findings underscore the opportunity for faith-based organizations to prevent COVID-19 by following local authorities ' guidance and the U.S. Government's Guidelines: Opening Up America Again (2) regarding modification of activities to prevent virus transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 1 O and 11, the wife of the church pastor, aged 56 years, and the pastor, aged 57 years, developed fever and cough. On March 12, the pastor, after becoming aware of similar nonspecific respiratory symptoms among members of their congregation, closed church A indefinitely. Because of fever, cough, and increasing shortness of breath, the couple sought testing for SARS-CoV-2 on March 13; both were notified of positive results by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing on March 16. The same day, ADH staff members began an investigation to identify how the couple had been exposed and to trace persons with whom they had been in contact . Based on their activities and onset dates, they likely were infected at church A events during March 6-8 and the husband might have then exposed others while presymptomatic during a Bible study event held on March 11. During March and April 2020, all persons in Arkansas who received testing for SARS-CoV-2 at any laboratory were entered into a database (Research Electronic Data Capture [REDCap]; version 8.8.0 ; Vanderbilt University) managed by ADH. Using a standardized questionnaire, ADH staff members interviewed persons who had positive test results to ascertain symptoms, onset date, and potential exposure information, including epidemiologic linkages to other COVID-19 patients; this information was stored in the database. Close contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were interviewed and enrolled in active symptom monitoring; those who developed symptoms were tested and their information was also entered into the database . Church A-associated cases were defined as those in 1) persons who had laboratory results positive for SARS-CoV-2 who identified contact with church A attendees as a source of exposure and 2) actively monitored contacts of church attendees who had a test result positive for SARS-CoV-2 after becoming symptomatic. The public health investigation focused on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among persons who attended church A events during March 6-11 . To facilitate the investigation , the pastor and his wife generated a list of 94 church members and guests who had registered for, or who, based on the couple's recollection, might have attended these events . During March 6-8, church A hosted a 3-day children 's event which consisted of two separate 1.5-hour indoor sessions (one on March 6 and one on March 7) and two, 1-hour indoor sessions during normal church services on March 8. This event was led by two guests from another state . During each session, children participated in competitions to collect offerings by hand from adults, resulting in brief close contact among nearly all children and attending adults . On March 7, food prepared by church members was served buffet-style . A separate Bible study event was held March 11; the pastor reported most attendees sat apart from one another in a large room at this event . Most children and some adults participated in singing during the children's event ; no singing occurred during the March 11 Bible study. Among all 94 persons who might have attended any of the events, 19 (20%) attended both the children's event and Bible study. The husband and wife were the first to be recognized by ADH among the 35 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 associated with church A attendance identified through April 22; their illnesses represent the index cases. During the investigation, two persons who were symptomatic (not the husband and wife) during March 6-8 were identified; these are considered the primary cases because they likely initiated the chain of transmission among church attendees. Additional cases included those in persons who attended any church A events during March 6-11, but whose symptom onset occurred on or after March 8, which was 2 days after the earliest possible church A exposure. One asymptomatic attendee who sought testing after household members became ill was included among these additional cases . Consistent with CDC recommendations for laboratory testing at that time (3), clinical criteria for testing included cough, fever, or shortness of breath ; asymptomatic persons were not routinely tested. To account for this limitation when calculating attack rates, upper and lower boundaries for the attack rates were estimated by dividing the total number of persons with laboratory -confirmed COVID-19 by the number of persons tested for SARS-CoV-2 and by the number of persons who attended church A during March 6-11, respectively. All analyses were performed using R statistical software (version 4.0.0; The R Foundation) . Risk ratios were calculated to compare attack rates by age, sex, and attendance dates . Fisher's exact test was used to calculate two-sided p-values; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant . Overall, 94 persons attended church A events during March 6-11 and might have been exposed to the index patients or to another infectious patient at the same event ; among these persons, 92 were successfully contacted and are included in the analysis . Similar proportions of church A attendees were aged :S18 years (35%), 19-64 However, a higher proportion of adults aged 19-64 years and ~65 years were tested (72% and 50%, respectively), and received positive test results (59% and 50%), than did younger persons. Forty-five persons were tested for SARS-CoV-2, among whom 35 (77.8%) received positive test results (Table 2). During the investigation, two church A participants who attended the March 6-8 children 's event were found to have had onset of symptoms on March 6 and 7; these represent the primary cases and likely were the source of infection of other church A attendees (Figure). The two out-of-state guests developed respiratory symptoms during March 9-10 and later received diagnoses of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, suggesting that exposure to the primary cases resulted in their infections . The two primary cases were not linked except through the church ; the persons lived locally and reported no travel and had no known contact with a traveler or anyone with confirmed COVID-19 . Patient interviews revealed no additional common exposures among church attendees . The estimated attack rate ranged from 38% (35 cases among all 92 church A event attendees) to 78% (35 cases among 45 church A event attendees who were tested for SARS-CoV-2) . When stratified by age, attack rates were significantly lower among persons aged 518 years (6.3%-25.0%) than among adults aged 19-64 years (59.4%-82.6%) (p<0.01 ). The risk ratios for persons aged 518 years compared with those for persons aged 19-64 years were 0.1-0.3. No severe illnesses occurred in children . Among the 35 persons with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, seven (20%) were hospitalized ; three (9%) patients died. At least 26 additional confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified among community members who, during contact tracing, reported contact with one or more of the 35 church A members with COVID -19 as an exposure. These persons likely were infected by church A attendees . Among these 26 persons, one was hospital ized and subsequently died. Thus, as of April 22, 61 confirmed cases (including eight [13%] hospitalizations and four [7%] deaths) had been identified in persons directly and indirectly associated with church A events . Top Discussion This investigation identified 35 confirmed COVID-19 cases among 92 attendees at church A events during March 6-11; estimated attack rates ranged from 38% to 78%. Despite canceling in-person church activities and closing the church as soon as it was recognized that several members of the congregation had become ill, widespread transmission within church A and within the surrounding community occurred . The primary patients had no known COVID-19 exposures in the 14 days preceding their symptom onset dates , suggesting that local transmission was occurring before case detection. Children represented 35% of all church A attendees but accounted for only 18% of persons who received testing and 6% of confirmed cases. These findings are consistent with those from other reports suggesting that many children with COVID-19 experience more asymptomatic infections or milder symptoms and have lower hospitalization rates than do adults (4,5). The role of asymptomat ic or mildly symptomat ic children in SARS -CoV-2 transm ission remains unknown and represents a critical knowledge gap as officials consider reopening public places . The risk for symptomatic infection among adults aged ~65 years was not higher than that among adults aged 19-64 years. However, six of the seven hospitalized persons and all three deaths occurred in persons aged ~65 years, consistent with other U.S. data indicating a higher risk for COVID-19-associated hospitalization and death among persons aged ~65 years (6). The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations . First, some infected persons might have been missed because they did not seek testing , were ineligible for testing based on criteria at the time, or were unable to access testing. Second, although no previous cases had been reported from this county, undetected low-level community transmission was likely , and some patients in this cluster might have had exposures outside the church . Third, risk of exposure likely varied among attendees but could not be characterized because data regarding individual behaviors (e.g., shaking hands or hugging) were not collected . Finally, the number of cases beyond the cohort of church attendees likely is undercounted because tracking out-of-state transmission was not possible , and patients might not have identified church members as their source of exposure . High transmission rates of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported from hospitals (7), long-term care facilities (8), family gatherings (9), a choir practice ( 1(JJ, and, in this report, church events. Faith-based organizations that are operating or planning to resume in-person operations , including regular services , funerals, or other events , should be aware of the potential for high rates of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These organizations should work with local health officials to determine how to implement the U.S. Government's guidelines for mod ifying activities during the COVID -19 pandem ic to prevent transm ission of the virus to their members and their communities (.2).

NeWSdentlst A skiing trip, a wedding, a choir practice: what these events have in common is that they were all occasions of coronavirus \u0093superspreading\u0094. This is when someone passes the virus on to an especially high number of people. While there is no universally agreed definition of a superspreading event, it is sometimes taken to be an incident in which someone passes on the virus to six or more other people. Getting to the bottom of why these puzzling clusters occur could be key to gaining control of the covid-19 pandemic and stopping a second wave of cases. For months, we have been hearing that the R number , or reproduction number, is what is needed to gauge the spread of covid-19. This is the average number of people that each infected person passes the virus on to. Before lockdown in the UK, the R number for coronavirus was estimated at somewhere between 2 and 3. Advertisement It is now more appreciated that there is great variability in the number of new cases that each infected person generates. This can be described by the epidemic\u0092s \u0093K number\u0094 \u0096 the dispersion parameter \u0096 with a lower value of K signifying more variability. You need to know both R and K for a good picture of how the virus is spreading through a community. According to an analysis of how covid-19 had spread to other countries from China by the end of February, the K number was 0.1, an extremely low value. The researchers estimated that 80 per cent of cases were caused by about 10 per cent of infected people. Those 10 per cent could trigger a cluster of infections, while most other people would pass on coronavirus to no one else and a few would give it to just one other person. In other words, superspreading is integral to the pandemic, says Quentin Leclerc at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Doctors followed up with the close contacts of every secondary case, about three or four each, and could find only 10 further infections, says Lea Hamner, a public health official in Skagit County. It is as if something qualitatively different were going on that night. What might that be? Transmission clusters have been seen with other diseases, including HIV, TB and typhoid, with a famous superspreader being a New York cook in the early 20th century who came to be known as Typhoid Mary . In these cases, it seemed there was something biological that made the person more likely to pass on their germs, probably a heavy microbe burden. With coronavirus, virus burden may well play a role, but this hasn\u0092t been investigated and we have no easy way to start doing so, says Benjamin Cowling at the University of Hong Kong in China. \u0093If we measure viral load in saliva, that\u0092s not the same as how much virus they\u0092re breathing out. You would have to do some kind of air sampling.\u0094 But as well as biology, the circumstances of the spreading event also seems to be important, and some common themes have emerged. Cowling\u0092s group carried out contact tracing of the first 1037 coronavirus cases in Hong Kong . They found a somewhat larger K value than the previous estimate, of 0.45, but that still means just 20 per cent of infected individuals caused 80 per cent of locally acquired cases. The team found that superspreading events tended to happen in indoor spaces, with people in close proximity. Social occasions led to more clusters than exposure in the workplace or home \u0096 mass transmissions occurred at weddings, temples, bars and karaoke parties, for instance. The risk seems to be higher if people are raising their voices in some way, such as singing or shouting. \u0093It\u0092s the volume of air that comes out of your lungs,\u0094 says Cowling.

When case numbers are rising exponentially, superspreading events are arguably less important, he says, as there are many clusters that spread and merge.Page 2 of 7 Finding coronavirus superspreaders may be key to halting a second wave | New Scientist 8/5/2020 https://www.newscientist.com/article/225037 2 of 7 PagelD #: 523 But avoiding these transmission clusters is key early in an epidemic before case numbers have risen sharply, or later on, when cases are falling and a second wave must be avoided. \u0093When you have very few cases, it\u0092s these [superspreading] events you need to watch out for,\u0094 says Leclerc. How can we reduce the chances of further superspreading events? \u0093Our guiding principles right now are outdoors is safer than inside, fewer people are safer than more people,\u0094 says Hamner. She sees indoor bars as a particular risk. \u0093A drunk person is well known for talking louder and louder the drunker they get.\u0094 These aren\u0092t new ideas \u0096 but making people aware of how important superspreading is could reinforce the need to avoid or at least mitigate these types of risky situations. It could also help inform how countries ease lockdown restrictions, says Leclerc, whose team has created a database of superspreading events around the world . For instance, only eight of the 201 clusters they identified took place within schools, which at the start of the pandemic were seen as a potential hotbed of infections . Identifying clusters in real time is also key for contact-tracing work, says Leclerc. \u0093If you manage to detect [superspreading events] and find the people infected, you can stop the spread before it goes on.\u0094 Reference: Research Square , DOI: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-29548/v1 Sign up to our free Health Check newsletter for a monthly round-up of all the health and fitness news you need to know More on these topics: coronavirus covid-19 Page 3 of 7 Finding coronavirus superspreaders may be key to halting a second wave | New Scientist 8/5/2020 https://www.newscientist.com/article/225037 PagelD #: 524 Magazine issue 3294 , published 5 August 2020 Coronavirus: US has no cohesive plan to tackle massive second wave How to hug people in a coronavirus-stricken world TRENDING LATEST VIDEO FREE Coronavirus: US has no cohesive plan to tackle massive second wave 1 Covid-19 news: World faces catastrophe from school closures, says UN 2 Lyme disease vaccine found to be safe and effective in clinical trial 3 A radical new theory rewrites the story of how life on Earth began 4 Opening schools in UK without more testing risks covid-19 second wave 5 SUBSCRIBE VIEW IN THE APP BUY IN PRINT Previous article Next articlePage 4 of 7 Finding coronavirus superspreaders may be key to halting a second wave | New Scientist 7 PagelD #: 525 ll>X Murphy Bed Clearance Sale Here are popular searches for people shopping for murphy beds MORE FROM NEW SCIENTIST HEALTH Page 5 of 7 Finding coronavirus superspreaders may be key to halting a second wave | New Scientist 8/5/2020 https://www.newscientist.com/article/225037 of PagelD #: 526 D> X PROMOTED STORIES Recommended by20 Movies So Disturbing People Walked Out Of The Theater Post FunScalp Psoriasis: Easier To Treat Than Ever.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Considerations for Events and Gatherings Considerations for Events & Gatherings Updated July 7, 2020 As some communities in the United States begin to plan and hold events and gatherings, the CDC offers the following considerations for enhancing protection of individuals and communities and preventing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Event planners and officials can determine, in collaboration with state and local health officials , whether and how to implement these considerations, making adjustments to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community . Because COVID-19 virus circulation varies in communities, these considerations are meant to supplement-not replace-any state, local, territorial, or tribal health and safety laws, rules, and regulations with which gatherings must comply . Organizers should continue to assess , based on current conditions, whether to postpone, cancel, or significantly reduce the number of attendees for gatherings. After reviewing the considerations listed on this page, event planners and administrators can use CDC's Events and Gatherings Readiness and Planning Tool [9 pages] to protect staff, volunteers, and attendees . Guiding Principles A gathering refers to a planned or spontaneous event, indoors or outdoors, with a small number of people participating or a large number of people in attendance such as a community event or gathering, concert, festival, conference, parade, wedding , or sporting event. The more people an individual interacts with at a gathering and the longer that interaction lasts, the higher the potential risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and COVID-19 spreading. The higher the level of community transmission in the area that the gathering is being held, the higher the risk of COVID- 19 spreading during a gathering. The size of an event or gathering should be determined based on state, local, territorial or tribal safety laws and regulations . The risk of COVID-19 spreading at events and gatherings increases as follows : Lowest risk: Virtual-only activities, events , and gatherings . More risk: Smaller outdoor and in-person gatherings in which individuals from different households remain spaced at least 6 feet apart , wear cloth face coverings, do not share objects, and come from the same local area (e.g., community , town, city, or county) . Higher risk: Medium-sized in-person gatherings that are adapted to allow individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and with attendees coming from outside the local area . https://www Highest risk: Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area. Targeting COVID-19's spread SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is thought to be mostly spread by respiratory droplets released when people talk, cough, or sneeze. It is thought that the virus may also spread to hands from a contaminated surface and then to the nose, mouth or eyes, causing infection . Therefore, personal prevention practices (such as handwashing , staying home when sick, maintaining 6 feet of distance , and wearing a cloth face covering ) and environmental prevention practices (such as cleaning and disinfection ) are important ways to prevent the virus's spread . These prevention principles are covered in this document. They provide event planners and individuals with actions to help lower the risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread during gatherings and events. Promoting Healthy Behaviors that Reduce Spread Event planners should consider implementing strategies to encourage behaviors that reduce the spread of COVID-19 among staff and attendees . Staying Home when Appropriate o Educate staff and attendees about when they should stay home . Advise employees and attendees to stay home if they have tested positive for COVID-19 or are showing COVID- 19 symptoms . Advise employees and attendees to stay home and monitor their health if they have had a close contact with a person who has symptoms of COVID-19 within the past 14 days. Develop policies that encourage sick employees to stay at home without fear of reprisal, and ensure employees are aware of these policies. CDC's criteria can help inform when employees should return to work : If they have been sick with COVID-19 If they tested positive for COVID-19 but had no symptoms If they have recently had a close contact with a person with COVID-19 Consider developing flexible refund policies for attendees for events that involve a participation fee. Hand Hygieneand Respiratory Etiquette o Require frequent employee handwashing (e.g., before, during , and after taking tickets; after touching garbage) with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and increase monitoring to ensure adherence . o If soap and water are not readily available, employees can use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol and rub their hands until dry. o Encourage staff to cover the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and sneezing . Used tissues should be thrown in the trash and hands washed immediately with soap and water for at least 20 seconds . o Encourage attendees to wash hands often and cover coughs and sneezes . o Attendees often exchange handshakes, fist bumps, and high-fives at meetings and sporting events. Display signs (physical and/or electronic) that discourage these actions during the event . Cloth Face Coverings o Require the use of cloth face coverings among staff. Cloth face coverings are most essential in times when physical distancing is difficult (e.g., when moving within a crowd or audience). o Provide all staff with information on proper use, removal, and washing of cloth face coverings . o Advise staff that cloth face coverings should not be placed on: Babies or children younger than 2 years old Anyone who has trouble breathing Anyone who is unconscious , incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove the cloth face covering without assistance https 531 o Encourage attendees ahead of the event to bring and use cloth face coverings at the event. o Cloth face coverings are meant to protect other people in case the wearer is unknowingly infected but does not have symptoms . Cloth face coverings are not surgical masks or respirators. They are not personal protective equipment . o Cloth face coverings are strongly encouraged in settings where individuals might raise their voice (e.g., shouting, chanting , singing). Adequate Supplies o Ensure adequate supplies to support healthy hygiene behaviors. Supplies include soap , water, hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol, paper towels, tissues, disinfectant wipes, cloth face coverings (as feasible), and no-touch trash cans . Signs and Messages o Post signs in highly visible locations (e.g., at entrances, in restrooms) that promote everyday protective measures and describe how to stop the spread of germs by properly washing hands and properly wearing a cloth face covering I!! . o Broadcast regular announcements on reducing the spread of COVID-19 on public address systems. o Include messages (for example, videos ) about behaviors that prevent spread of COVID-19 when communicating with staff, vendors, and attendees (such as on the event website and through event social media accounts ). o Consider developing signs and messages in alternative formats (e.g., large print, braille, American Sign Language) for people who have limited vision or are blind or people who are deaf or hard of hearing. o Find freely available CDC print and digital resources about COVID-19 on CDC's communications resources main page . Maintaining Healthy Environments Event planners should consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy environments. Cleaning and Disinfection o Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces within the venue at least daily or between uses as much as possible -for example, door handles, sink handles, drinking fountains, grab bars, hand railings, and cash registers . o Clean and disinfect shared objects between uses-for example, payment terminals, tables, countertops, bars, and condiment holders . o Consider closing areas such as drinking fountains that cannot be adequately cleaned and disinfected during an event . o Develop a schedule for increased, routine cleaning and disinfection. o Plan for and enact these cleaning routines when renting event space and ensure that other groups who may use your facilities follow these routines . o If transport vehicles like buses are used by the event staff, drivers should practice all safety actions and protocols as indicated for other staff-for example, washing hands often and wearing cloth face coverings and maintaining social distance of bus riders. To clean and disinfect event buses, vans, or other vehicles see guidance for bus transit operators and drivers for hire, and adapt as needed. o Ensure safe and correct use and storage of cleaners and disinfectants to avoid harm to employees and other individuals . Always read and follow label instructions for each product, and store products securely away from children. o Use EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19 . o Cleaning products should not be used near children. Staff should ensure that there is adequate ventilation when using these products to prevent attendees or themselves from inhaling toxic vapors. o Use disposable gloves when removing garbage bags or handling and disposing of trash . After using disposable gloves , throw them out in a lined trash can. Do not disinfect or reuse the gloves. Wash hands after removing gloves Restrooms 532 o Consider limiting the number of people who occupy the restroom at one time to allow for social distancing. o Do not allow lines or crowds to form near the restroom without maintaining a distance of at least 6 feet from other people. It may be helpful to post signs or markers to help attendees maintain the appropriate social distance of at least 6 feet. o Ensure that open restrooms are: Operational with functional toilets . Cleaned and disinfected regularly , particularly high-touch surfaces faucets, toilets, stall doors , doorknobs , countertops, diaper changing tables, and light switches. Clean and disinfect restrooms daily or more often , if possible , with EPA-approved disinfectants against COVID-19 . Ensure safe and correct application of disinfectants and keep products away from children. Adequately stocked with supplies for handwashing, including soap and water or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol (for staff and older children who can safely use hand sanitizer), paper towels , tissues, and no- touch trash cans . Ventilation If you are providing portable toilets , also provide portable handwashing stations and ensure that they remain stocked throughout the duration of the event. If possible , provide hand sanitizer stations that are touch-free. o Ensure ventilation systems operate properly and increase circulation of outdoor air as much as possible, for example, by opening windows and doors. Do not open windows and doors if doing so poses a safety or health risk to staff or attendees (e.g., ri sk of falling or triggering asthma symptoms) . o If portable ventilation equipment like fans are used, take steps to minimize air from them blowing from one person directly at another person to reduce the potential spread of any airborne or aerosolized viruses. Water Systems o To minimize the risk of Legionnaires' disease and other diseases associated with water, take steps to ensure that all water systems and features (e.g., sink faucets, drinking fountains, decorative fountains) are safe to use after a prolonged facility shutdown . Drinking fountains should be cleaned and sanitized , but encourage staff and attendees to bring their own water, as feasible, to minim ize touching and use of water fountains. Modified Layouts o Limit attendance or seating capacity to allow for social distancing , or host smaller events in larger rooms . o Use multiple entrances and exits and discourage crowded waiting areas . o Block off rows or sections of seating in order to space people at least 6 feet apart . o Eliminate lines or queues if possible or encourage people to stay at least 6 feet apart by provid ing signs or other visual cues such as tape or chalk marks . o Prioritize outdoor activities where social distancing can be maintained as much as possible . o Offer online attendance options in addition to in-person attendance to help reduce the number of attendees . Physical Barriers and Guides o Provide physical guides , such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls , to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart in lines and at other times (e.g., guides for creating one-way routes). o Install physical barriers , such as sneeze guards and partitions , in areas where it is difficult for individuals to remain at least 6 feet apart . Barriers can be useful at cash registers and other areas where maintaining physical distance of 6 feet is difficult. o Change seating layout or availability of seating so that people can remain least 6 feet apart. Communal Spaces o Stagger use of shared indoor spaces such as dining halls, game rooms , and lounges as much as possible and clean and disinfect them between uses . o Add physical barriers, such as plastic flexible screens, between bathroom sinks and beds, especially when they cannot be at least 6 feet apart. o Clean and disinfect bathrooms regularly (e.g., in the morning and evening or after times of heavy use) using EPA- registered disinfectants . o For more information on communal spaces in event housing (e.g., laundry rooms, shared bathrooms, and recreation areas) follow CDC's guidance for Shared or Congregate Housing . Food Service o There is no evidence that COVID -19 is spread by food . However, people sharing utensils and congregating around food service areas can pose a risk. o If the event includes food service, refer to CDC's COVID-19 considerations for restaurants and bars. o Use touchless payment options as much as possible , if available . o Ask customers and employees to exchange cash or card payments by placing them on a receipt tray or on the counter rather than by hand to avoid direct hand-to-hand contact. o Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as pens , counters, or hard surfaces between use and encourage patrons to use their own pens. o Provide physical guides, such as tape on floors or sidewalks and signs on walls, to ensure that individuals remain at least 6 feet apart when waiting in line to order or pick up. o If a cafeteria or group dining room is used, serve individually plated meals or grab-and-go options , and hold activities in separate areas . o Use disposable food service items includ ing utensils and dishes . If disposable items are not feasible or desirable, ensure that all non-disposable food service items are handled with gloves and washed with dish soap and hot water or in a dishwasher. o Individuals should wash their hands after removing their gloves or after directly handling used food service items . o Avoid offering any self-serve food or drink options, such as buffets, salad bars, and drink stations . Consider having pre-packaged boxes or bags for each attendee. Shared Objects o Discourage people from sharing items that are difficult to clean , sanitize , or disinfect. o Limit any sharing of food , tools, equipment , or supplies by staff members . o Ensure adequate supplies to minimize sharing of high-touch materials to the extent possible; otherw ise, limit use of supplies and equipment to one group of staff members or attendees at a time, and clean and disinfect them between use. Maintaining Healthy Operations Event organizers and staff may consider implementing several strategies to maintain healthy operations. Regulatory Awareness o Be aware of local or state regulatory agency policies related to group gatherings to determine if events can be held. Protections for Staff and Attendees who are at Higher Risk of Severe Illness from COVID-19 o Offer options for staff at higher risk for severe illness (including older adults and people of any age with underlying medical conditions) that limit their exposure risk. For example: Offer telework and modified job responsibilities for staff, such as setting up for the event rather than working at the registration desk. Replace in-person meetings with video- or tele-conference calls whenever possible. o As feasible , offer options for attendees at higher risk for severe illness that limit their exposure risk (e.g., virtual attendance). o Consider limiting event attendance to staff and guests who live in the local area (e.g., community, city, town, or county) to reduce risk of spreading the virus from areas with higher levels of COVID-19. If attendance is open to staff and guests from other communit ies, cities, town or counties , provide information to attendees so they can make an informed decision about participation . o Put policies in place to protect the privacy of people at higher risk for severe illness regarding their underlying medical conditions . 534 Limited, Staggered, or Rotated Shifts and Attendance Times o Consider ways to significantly reduce the number of attendees. o Use flexible worksites (e.g., telework) and flexible work hours (e.g., staggered shifts) to help establish policies and practices for social distancing of 6 feet between employees , volunteers, and others. o Rotate or stagger shifts and arrival times to limit the number of employees in a venue at the same time . o Stagger and limit attendance times to minimize the number of guests at the venue. Travel & Transit o Encourage employees to use transportation options that minimize close contact with others (e.g., walking or biking, driving or riding by car -alone or with household members only) . Consider offering the following support: Ask employees to follow the CDC guidance on how to Protect Yourself When Using Transportation , including public transit. Allow employees to shift their hours so they can commute during less busy times . Ask employees to wash their hands as soon as possible after their trip. o Reconfigure parking lots to limit congregation points and ensure proper separation of employees (e.g., closing every other parking space) . o Encourage rideshare drivers to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in the vehicle and avoid providing pooled rides or picking up multiple passengers who would not otherwise be riding together on the same route. Designated COVID-19 Point of Contact o Designate an administrator or office to be responsible for responding to COVID -19 concerns . All staff and attendees should know who this person or office is and how to contact them. Communication Systems o Put systems in place to: Encourage staff and attendees to self-report to event officials or a COVID-19 point of contact if they have symptoms of COVID-19, a positive test for COVID-19, or were exposed to someone with COVID-19 within the last 14 days, in accordance with health information sharing regulations for COVID-19 (e.g., see \"Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts \" in the Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick section below), and other applicable privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations . Advise attendees prior to the event or gathering that they should not attend if they have symptoms of, a positive test for, or were recently exposed (within 14 days) to COVID -19. Notify staff, attendees, and the public of cancellations and restrictions in place to limit people 's exposure to COVID-19 (e.g., limited hours of operation) . Identify and address potential language, cultural, and disability barriers associated with communicating COVID-19 information to event staff and participants . Tailor information so that it is easily understood by various audiences and is available in alternative formats and languages . Learn more about reaching people of diverse languages and cultures by visiting: Know Your Audience . You also can learn more about commun icating to staff in a crisis at: Crisis Communications Plan. Leave (Time Off) Policies o Implement flexible sick leave policies and practices that are not punitive and enable employees to stay home when they are sick, have been exposed, are caring for someone who is sick, or who must stay home with children if schools or child care centers are closed . o Examine and revise policies for leave, telework, and employee compensation as needed. o Ensure that any relevant policies are communicated to staff. Back-Up Staffing Plan o Monitor absenteeism of employees, cross-train staff, and create a roster of trained back-up staff. o Develop policies for return-to-work and event facilities after an employee has COVID-19. CDC's criteria to discontinue home isolation and quarantine can inform these policies. PagelD 535 o Train staff on all safety protocols . Consider using CDC's Interim Guidance for Businesses and Employers as a guide . o Conduct training virtually to ensure that social distancing is maintained during training . o If training needs to be done in person, maintain social distancing. Virtual training is clearly better for infection control when feasible. Recognize Signs and Symptoms o If feasible, conduct daily health checks (e.g., temperature screening and/or symptom checking) of staff and attendees safely and respectfully, and in accordance with any applicable privacy laws and regulations . o Event administrators may consider using examples of screening methods in CDC's General Business FAQs as a guide . Sharing Facilities o Encourage any organizations that share or use the same venue to also follow these considerations and limit shared use, if possible . Support Coping and Resilience o Promote employees' ability to eat healthy foods, exercise, get enough sleep, and find time to unwind. o Encourage employees to talk with people they trust about their concerns and how they are feeling . o Consider posting signs for the national distress hotline: 1-800-985-5990, or text TalkWithUsto 66746; The National Domestic Violence Hotline : 1-800-799 -7233 and TTY 1-800-787-3224; and The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline : 1-800-273 -TALK (8255). Lessons Learned After the Event o Meet with the emergency operations coordinator or planning team for your venue to discuss and note lessons learned. o Determine ways to improve planning and implementation processes if the event will happen again. o Update your plans regularly according to the state and local situation and orders . Preparing for When Someone Gets Sick Event planners should consider several strategies to implement when someone gets sick. Advise Sick Individuals of Home Isolation Criteria o Communicate to sick staff members that they should not return to work until they have met CDC's criteria to discontinue home isolation . Isolate and Transport Those Who are Sick o Make sure that staff and attendees know that they should not come to the event and that they should notify event planners (e.g., the designated COVID-19 point of contact) if they become sick with COVID-19 symptoms, test positive for COVID-19, or have been exposed to someone with symptoms or a suspected or confirmed case. o Immediately separate staff and attendees with COVID-19 symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath) at the event . Individuals who are sick should go home or to a healthcare facility, depending on how severe their symptoms are, and follow CDC guidance for caring for themselves . o Individuals who have had close contact with a person who has symptoms should be separated, sent home, and advised to follow CDC guidance for community-related exposure (see \"Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts\" below). If symptoms develop, individuals should follow CDC guidance for caring for themselves . o Planners may follow CDC's Guidance for Shared or Congregate Housing for any staff who live in event housing . o Work with venue administrators, local officials, and healthcare providers to identify an isolation area to separate anyone who has COVID-like symptoms or who has tested positive but does not have symptoms. Event healthcare providers should use Standard and Transmission -Based Precautions when caring for sick people . See: What Healthcare Personnel Should Know About Caring for Patients with Confirmed or Possible COVID-19 Infection . o Establish procedures for safely transporting anyone sick to their home or to a healthcare facility. If you are calling an ambulance or bringing someone to the hospital , call first to alert them that the person may have COVID-19. Clean and Disinfect https://www 536 o Close off areas used by a sick person and do not use these areas until after cleaning and disinfecting them (for outdoor areas, this includes surfaces or shared objects in the area, if applicable) . o Wait at least 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting . If 24 hours is not feasible, wait as long as possible . Ensure safe and correct ~ and storage of cleaning and disinfection products, including storing them securely away from children . Notify Health Officials and Close Contacts o In accordance with state and local laws and regulations, event planners should notify local health officials , staff, and attendees of any case of COVID-19 while maintaining confidentiality in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other applicable laws and regulations. o Advise those who have had close contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19 to stay home, self-monitor for symptoms , and follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop. After reviewing the considerations listed on this page, event planners and administrators can use CDC's Events and Gatherings Readiness and Planning Tool [9 pages] to protect staff, volunteers, and attendees .

It is a term that has been much used in relation to COVID-19 , particularly in social media. On its widest definition, it refers to a propensity to infect a larger than average ownber of peop le. Given the biological, behavioural and environmental variables relevant to infectivity, this migbt be pertinent to ahnost any infucted individual who is not physically isolated from others . or is the term confined to individuals with a propensity to pread iofectiow; disease: it can potentially be used to describe events , policies or settings . This article explores the use of the term and considers circumstances in which the wide definition can be problematic. One problem is that it can lead to undeserved apportionment of moral blame to aJleged super - spreaders . Another is that it can detract from scientific investigation of the heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission . The author calls for a clearer epidemiological definition. Keywor ds Confidentiality -Corona virus OVID preadiog Introduct ion: COVID -19 Super -spreaders At the time of writing , exit strategies from COVID-19 lock.down are unclear , but de- escalation of phy ical distancing measures is likely to be gradual. One aspect of hielding the vulnerable is to identify those at risk of developing seriou s and potentiaJJy life-threatening symptoms and distance them from sources of infection. More work is needed to identify such groups , which include people over the age of65 and those with underlying health conditions. Another is to identify and isolate the infected. This is complicated by 1IDcertainty a to whether efforts to produce a vaccine will succeed and !El Emna PagelD #: 538 Asian Bioethics Review how long it will take. JI is possible that post-infection immunity may be short-lived (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Contro l (ECDC) 2020 , 9), and even if infection confers immunity, the ECDC estimates that 67% of the population would need to have had the virus in order to prevent ongoing transmission and that 'Some form of physical distancing interventions will therefore need to be in place for at least several months from now' (2020 , 18). A second wave (and potentially further waves ) of COVID- 19 is possible (Xu and Li 2020 ). The ECDC (2020 , 7) estimates that the reproductive number (RO) of COVID- 19 in EU/EEA countries is 3 28. That is, a person contracting the novel virus will pass it on to an average of around 3 people. The RO is a measure of potential transmissibility that is difficult to establish, particularly if the accuracy of the data is questionabl e as where, for example, there is under- or mis-reporting. Underlying the RO is a considerable variation which, early in the outbreak, Mackenzie (2020 ) postulated may be down to the role of super-spreaders: around 10% of cases could be responsibl e for up to 80% of transmis- sion. If so, she argued , control of super-spreading would be essential in tackling the outbreak. The situation is complicated by the fact that so-called super-spreaders ofCOVID-19 cannot always self-identify and take steps to mitigate the risk to others. The virus has been detected 1- 3 days before onset of symptoms, and the ECDC sees this as a potential major source of transmission. Some individuals are asymptomatic throughout, though the risk of transmission is probably somewhat lower in such cases. There have also been reports of COVID-19 positive tests during conval escence, following a negative test (Chen et al 2020 ). COVID-19 may itself have super-spreading tendencies flowing from the occurrence of atypical symptoms (Wang et al. 2020 ), which may have led to a failure to identify many mild case a phenomenon that bas been exacerbated by limited and variable availability of testing, tracing and screening. In light of the importance of identifying and controlling infection , this article begins by considering the definition of 'super-spreader' and argues that the term is vague and unhelpful. It goes on to demonstrate ways in which it has been applied to impute moral condemnation on individuals accused of spreading COVID -19 and calls for the development of a clearer and widely held scientific definition of super-spread that accommodates the relevance of individual factors in disease transmission without attributing moral blame. A Term of Art The term 'super-spreader' bas recently entered our consciousness , alongside words such as 'comorbidity' , 'furlough' and 'lockdown'. A super-spreader, usually identified in retrospect, has a greater than average propensity to infect a larger munber of people. Super-spreading is not a new phenomenon: symptomless 'Typhoid Mary' was exiled for 26 years for appar- ently infecting many others in the 1800s (Marineli et al. 2013 ), and super -spreading was thought to be a driver ofMERS , SARS (2002 -2003) and, to a lesser extent, Ebola (Wong et al. 2015 ). Stein (2011 ) observes that observational and modelling studies support a 20l80 mle whereby 20% of individuals are likely to contribute around 80% of the transmission potential in a given infectious disease . Many variables make up this tendency, and this bas potential to limit the meaningfulness of the term. Springer R.A. 165Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document #: 539 Asian Bioethics Review The label 'super-spreader' is a term of art that has been utilised to describe settings, events and individuals. Super-spreading settings include cruise ships and aeroplanes as well as hospitals, care homes and potentially schools, particularly where they utilise ventilation systems. As for events , any large gathering or movement of groups or individuals can constitute super-spreading. So too can policy decisions or indeed any occurrence which in hindsight exacerbated infection rates, such as the lack of control measures when SARS first emerged and single cases were treated as atypical pneumo - nia and transmitted to others (WHO 2003 ). As highlighted above, COVID-19 itselfhas super-spreading tendencies given its potential for atypical symptoms and pre- symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission . The term is particularly problematic when applied to individual 'super-spreaders', as it can mean different things to different groups . Media interest in super-spreaders focuses on the early stages of the epidemic when efforts are being made to contain, trace and delay. Used in this way, a 'super-spreader' will generally have interacted with a larger than average number of people, making tracing difficult or impossible. At the other end of the spectrum , scientific interest can focus on the heterogeneity of popu- lations in the transmission of infectious d.isease . Used in this sense. 'super-spreading' is connected to the scientific nature of the virus and the way it manifests in some humans. There is speculation that some people with COVID -19 are especially infectious (Boseley and Belam 2020 ). Super-spreading is therefore a product of biological, behavioural and environmental factors. It can be used to describe decisions, policies, events, settings and individuals - in fact, anything that contribute s to inc.reased rates of infection can be seen (by some groups) as super-spreading . The wide and varied use of the term 'super-spreader' is problematic for two reasons considered in subsequent sections : it can lead to appor- tionment of moral blame to alleged super-spreaders and it cou Id detract from scientific investigation into heterogeneity ofCOVID-19 if misunderstanding leads to diminished public support and trust. Blaming Super-spreaders Alleged super-spreaders of COVID-19 have attracted considerable media interest Patient 31, a member of the Shincheonji church, was thought to have turned the tide in South Korea (Kasulis 2020 ). As the number of deaths increased, anger was directed at the church, and the founder's apology was broadcast around the world . In India, the state of Punjab quarantined 40,000 people following around 30 deaths linked to a 70- year-old preacher who died of the disease (BBC News 2020 ). In the UK, a Brighton businessperson was labelled a 'culprit' early in the course of COVID-19 (see Ball 2020 for criticism) . Each was labelled by parts of the media a 'super-sp reader' whether or not the host was aware of the risks they posed to others or the repercussions their infection could have . These factors were not always reflected in media reports. There is a public interest in the location and number of cases, and in the early days of the crisis, when cases were few, this may have enabled some to piece together the identity of infected individuals. The Brighton case in England resulted in 'super- spreader ' headline claims from newspapers including the Daily Mail , Guardian, Sun and Telegraph_ The individual came foiward to reveal the steps he had taken on Springer R.A. 166Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-24 Filed 10/13/20 Page 4 of 8 PagelD #: 540 Asian Bioethics Review learning that he had come into contact with a COVID-19-positive person , alleged ly due to fears of scapegoating (Duggan et al. 2020 ). Tum to Twitter and #superspreaders has been employed as a term to signal moral blame, aimed at individua ls and groups including political leaders , runners , cyclists and the police. Opprobrium may rightly follow ifa symptomatic individual knowingly puts others at risk in avoidable circumstances, such as the reported cases of people deliberate ly coughing in the faces of others . However , to attach moral blame to those labelled after the event as super-spreaders is highly problematic , most obvious ly because carriers of COVID-19 can be asymptomatic, but also because the label can be stigmatising and potentially deter the symptomatic from coming forward if they have recently been in contact with large or vulnerable numbers. Spreading can be exaceibated by poor hygiene or certain social practices such as hand shaking, but infection of others is not evidence alone that guidelines on behaviour have been ignored. SadJy , as the pandemic and resulting fear have escalated, so have examp les of the public viewing anyone 'other' as a potential super -spreader (Coates 2020 ). Delivering Ethical Research on Heterogeneity of COVID-19 Transmission Another problem with the term 'super-spreader' is that its wide use has potential to detract from its importance in research on heterogeneity oftransmissionofCOVID-19 . If 'super-spreader' is understood in lay terms to attract varying degrees of moral blame , then epidemiological investigation of its incidence may be less likely to gain public support and understanding. There is a paucity of scientific evidence of the role or even the existence of especially infectious people with COVID-19. On a narrow scientific definition, a super-spreader would have particular biological characteristics that would increase the tendency to infect others. For example, a mouse model study by Gopinath et al (2014) demonstrated the super- spreading tendencies of a minority of mice infected with Salmonella. lf any potential biological super-spreading tendencies of COVID-19 were better understood, then it could aid management and control through, for examp le, isolation or targeted vaccination if and when it becomes available. Research might useful ly focus on the tendency of some individuals to shed high levels of the pathogen, including investigation of co-moibidity, genetics, viral load and infectivity at different stages of presentation. lo COVID-19 , the relationship between viral load, severity and infectivity is complex and poorly understood. Increased viral load does not necessarily result in more severe symptoms (Geddes 2020 ), and infection dose is currently uncertain. Clearly, the propensity for biological factors to lead to infection of olhers is highly dependen t on behavioural and environmental factors . Thus, a broader definition of super-spreading might encompass research on biological and external factors, combining focus on the virus, the host and the environment Prt>- COVID-19, Lloyd -Smith et al (2005) argued that control measures for infectious disease that focus on individual-specific measures can outperform population-based measures. They proposed a rigorous protocol for defining super-spreading events that would supplement the RO with information about factors such as distribution and range. Research bringing greater clarity as to the factors that drive variations in infectivity would contribute to targeted control policies that could reduce reliance on widespread lockdown. Springer R.A. 167Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP Document 20-24 Filed 10/13/20 Page 5 of 8 PagelD #: 541 Asian Bioethics Review However, such research is likely to be reliant upon the public giving up their confidential data or at least cooperating if such data are mandated. Technology offers a potential to track, predict, trace contacts and respond in a more precise manner. There are, for example , several apps in development/use. Some allow users to report symptoms so that more can be learned about how the virus behaves, some give people advice on the basis of reported symptoms and some operate in conjunction with testing to alert individuals with whom an infected person has come into contact , to isolate. These apps offer potential to learn more about heterogeneity and also to implement more targeted control measures in response. In many countries, efficacy will be reliant on the willingness of individuals to sign up to the apps. Those individuals will need assurance that their privacy will be respected and that negative implications will not flow from their identification as a perceived 'super -spreader' . Some governments are making more extensive use of c.onfidential informa- tion that does not rely on patient consent. In the UK, National Health Service (NHS) England and Improvement and NHSX (the unit driving digital transfor- mation of care) have announced the development of a digital platform that will bring together health data, Al and cloud computing (Gould et al. 2020 ). They are investing in the help of private companies such as Micro oft, Google and Amazon Web services to bring this about . They have provided assurances that the data 'will remain under NHS England and NHS Improvement's control' and that the data will be destroyed or returned when the emergency is over (Gould et al. 2020 ). The dashboard will give metrics about occupancy levels in hospitals and capacity and will enable decision-makers to 'Understand how the virus is spreading at a local level and identify risks to particularly vulner- able populations '. On 20 March 2020, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), on behalf of the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care , issued a notice under Regu- lation 3(4) of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 (COPI). Regulation 3(4) allow the Secretary of State, having had independent advice from the Confidentiality Advisory Group , to give notice to health organisa- tions , general practices and local authorities that confidential information will be re.quired (DHSC 2020 ) for a certain purpose. The purpose in this case is COVID-19 and includes understanding risks and trends including (amongst other things): locating, contacting, screening , flagging and monitoring such patients and collecting information about and providing services in relation to testing , diag- nosis , self-isolation, fitness to worlc , treatment, medical and social interventions and recovery from Covid-19. (DHSC 2020 , 2) This widely framed notice mandates the processing and sharing of confidential information, in circumstances where patients have not given informed consent Together with the proposals to share information with private companies for the production of the Dashboard , it is a high-risk strategy that will have profound implications if public trust is undermined . Whilst efforts will be made to protect the identity of the patients, anonymity is not a binary concept and, as argued above in relation to the Brighton case, media interest in 'super- Springer R.A. 168Case 1:20-cv-04844-NGG-CLP 20-24 Filed PagelD #: 542 Asian Bioethics Review spreaders' could lead to 'jigsaw identifiability' and to moral blame, which in turn could impact on trust. A Change in Termino logy? The term ' uper-spreader' makes an exciting headline, but its employment in social media sometimes lacks a scientific basis . Rather it often points to uointended action or is suggestive of negligent actions of an individual and apportions moral blame . And yet, it is essential that we promote a culture of ethical research on the biological, behavioural and environmental influences on transmission . The argument set out in this article is that the definition is too broad to be helpful and that its (mis)use in some social media has resulted in negative connotations. Consideration of the tendencies of individuals to exacerbate infection rates is a worthy focus of research. As more targeted public health responses are developed to replace widespread physical distancing policies , it is increasingly important that heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission is explored and factored into responses. To the extent that super-spreading is an aspect of research on heterogeneity, there is a risk that the negative connotations the term has attracted will result in public reticence to give up the private information upon which that research might depend . Greater accuracy of definition would help ensure that debate around the term is not at cross-purposes, help reduce or prevent moral blame of those who unwittingly infect oth.ers and could enhance public trust around the use of confidential data. The aim of this article has been to draw attention to problems in the use of the term 'super-spreader'. Turning briefly to potential solutions, one option would be to avoid use of the term altogeth .er, but it is well accepted in the scientific literature (see for example Lloyd-Smith 2005, Stein 2011, Gopinath 2014), and its abandonment could disrupt important linkage between current and previous research . Another option would be to encourage the use of the terms 'super-spreading' and 'super-spreading events' in epidemiology. in place of 'super-spreader'. This might reduce stigma, but it is unlikely to limit more general (mis)application of the term . Another option would be to encourage the development of a clearer taxonomy of super -spreading so as to take scientific ownership of the term and discourage inappropriate lay adoption, potentially through a classification of behavioural , environmental and biological super- spreading.

They are a primary source of support and comfort for their members. Often trusted more than governments or health-agencies, faith leaders can share health information to protect their communities that will be more likely to be accepted than from other sources . By sharing simple steps to prevent COVID-19 faith organizations can promote helpful information, reduce fear and stigma, and provide reassurance to people in their communities. Because faith leaders are integrated into their communities through service and compassionate networks, they are often able to reach the most vulnerable among us with assistance and health information. In short, they are a critical link in the safety net for vulnerable people in their communities.
