After I migrated to Canada, I got an opportunity to work with an Integrative Family Doctor, who prescribes natural treatment for many patients' conditions. I was surprised with the symptoms relief many patients expiring, while they were adding natural therapies to their treatment plan. Sometimes those measures were life style or dietary changes, sometimes naturiceutical prescribed as an adjuvant therapy to patients' antipsyhiatric medications, another occasion it was totally natural treatments. It opened my eyes about alternative treatments and decided to explore more about natural treatment for mental health disorders. So, I decided to study naturopathic medicine at Throughout the years there have been two traditions within the practice of medicine. One is the 'art of healing ' which involves its own specialised brand of training. The art of healing is dependent on the prescriber 's foreknowledge and the clients' viewpoint of the prosperous results. The 'Science of healing ' is based on scientific and technological ideas. This tradition results in a lower liability for practitioners regarding the showing of an original approach to medicine, however the results of this method are more calculable (Kayne 2002). It is believed that the tradition of the 'art of healing' is increasing in popularity. The World Health Organisation states ' 'that the terms ' 'complementary medicine ' ' or ' 'alternative medicine' ' are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country 's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system\" (World Health Organization 2000). This type of treatment, is commonly known as 'Complementary and alternative medicine' (CAM). The word complementary derives from the meaning 'together with' established practices and the word alternative refers to 'in place' of established practices. Some patients choose to participate in complementary therapies along with the medication prescribed by their general practitioner whilst others prefer complementary therapies as opposed to the medications It could be considered that conventional medicine has indirectly contributed to the rise of complementary and alternative medicine. A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) As a tree grows it forms branches and those branches sprout more helping the tree mature by reaching to catch sunlight, growing taller and stronger this tree will bare good fruit. The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine is one of the twenty seven institutes/ centers that make up the National Institutes of Health. Keeping the theme of the NIH, National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine also keeps research goals and objectives specifically to \"enable better evidence-based decision making regarding complementary and alternative medicine use and its integration into health care and health promotion.\" (National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine) Today we have alternative medicine which was developed thousands of years ago and have a long-standing historical value of effectiveness, advantages, and some drawbacks. Diagnosis was the first approach to any illness. Alternative medicine looks at the factors of equilibrium and the environment in which one lives and the disease is considered an imbalance between the two; cleansing the whole body than on a particular problem to get the balance back in sync. Very much the description of the Buddhist and the Greek cultures of medicine and healing the Complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM, can be characterized as a gathering of restorative, human services, and healing systems other than those incorporated into health care in the United States. CAM incorporates the perspectives, speculations, modalities, items, and practices connected with these systems and their utilization to treat disease and advance health and prosperity (McKenzie, 2012). Even though heterogeneous, the significant CAM frameworks have numerous normal attributes, including an attention on individualizing medications, treating the entire individual, advancing self-consideration and self-recuperating, and perceiving the otherworldly way of every person. What's more, numerous CAM frameworks have attributes generally found in standard human services, for example, an emphasis on great sustenance and preventive practices. Dissimilar to standard medication, CAM frequently needs or has just restricted trial and clinical concentrate; then again, experimental examination of CAM is starting to address this learning crevice. In this manner, limits in the Chem 253 - Organic Chemistry I Lab 10: Isolation of Identification of the major constituent of clove oil 3/15/2012 Purpose: The purpose of this lab was to isolate the cove oil from ground cloves and determine the identity of the major constituent that is known to have the molecular formula C10H12O2 through IR It encompasses diet, nutritional medicine, therapies and self-care regimes to attain healing (Young, 2007). Naturopathy has six principles: 1. The healing power of nature (vis medicatrix naturae) - Naturopaths identify and remove obstacles to cure to ensure that the body can heal itself and maintain health. 2. First do no harm (primum no nocere) - Naturopaths use natural substances to prevent suppression of symptoms which leads to harm and a blockage to cure and health. 3. Identify and treat the cause (tolle causam) - Naturopaths look for the cause of the disease and don't just treat the symptoms. 4. The physician as teacher (docere) - Naturopaths advise and encourage their patients to take control of their own health and also see each patient visit as an opportunity for learning. 5. Treat the whole person (in perturbato animo sicut in corpore sanitas esse non potest) - Naturopaths treat the whole person, from their internal environment such as the physical, mental and emotional, to their external environment which includes social factors. 6. Prevention (principiis obsta: sero medicina curator) - Naturopaths focus on preventing disease by determining risk factors and assisting their patients to make healthy lifestyle choices (Bodhiclinic.com, 2018; Young, Holistic Healing Argumentative Dr. James Marcum, a cardiologist at the Chattanooga Heart Institute in Tennessee claims, \"Pharmaceutical drugs don't heal people.\" In fact, he states, \"Much of the time they do more harm than good\"(Milner). U.S. Citizens need to stop taking harmful pills and start using more natural, holistic healing methods. Everyone has probably used a pill before to relieve their pain, but there are healthier ways to feel just as good. According to the results of the National Health Interview Survey, \"In 2012, 33.2% of U.S. adults used complementary health approaches\"(What Complementary and Integrative Approaches Do Americans Use?). While some people believe conventional medicine is a better choice, it is clear that holistic healing can replace prescription drugs because they are more safe and effective than prescription drugs, and they are more practical in many ways. Holistic Healthcare-How Should Nursing Support Patients' Rights? Healthcare treatments are no longer being determined by set protocols for a particular diagnosis or disease process. Increasingly more common, individualized, patient-driven adaptations are being implemented to improve adherence and compliance with treatment. Society as a whole is changing. The influx Holistic Medicine Holistic Medicine, commonly referred to as \"Alternative Medicine\", is a vast and rapidly growing new scientific field. It is derived mainly from ancient, traditional methods of healing that have often been practiced in the East for centuries. These include a variety of techniques from herbal healing to acupuncture to homeopathy to energy channeling. Due to the large number of methods that are covered by the term, there are various definitions of Holistic Medicine. However, all literature seems to agree that Alternative Medicine, is exactly what the name suggests: an 'alternative' approach to healing and medicine. It is a more personal move toward health care, which attempts to connect the mind, body and spirit. There are several reasons why I have decided to pursue a career in Naturopathic medicine. First and foremost I want to help people. Septic arthritis in my hip at the age 9 months has led to a lifetime of being constantly involved in many disciplines of the healthcare system. And while medical doctors and surgeons have provided me with the ability to walk and lead a normal life, it was naturopathic and chiropractic doctors that really helped me overcome my overall health concerns. I owe a lot to naturopathic medicine and ultimately wish to become a naturopathic doctor so that I can help other people in ways that I was helped myself. I know that my passion lies within medicine, but the '10 minute appointment followed by a prescription' kind of healthcare does not appeal to me. Alternative Medicine Therapies Alternative remedies, sometimes known as complementary remedies, offer a wide variety of products and methods in improving well-being separate from contemporary medicinal practices. According to Alternative Medicine Although \"Alternative\" or \"Complementary\" medicine has been kept on the fringes of the medical sciences in the past, it is becoming increasingly more popular, and more reputable. Alternative medicines are those medical systems which are not taught to or practiced by most conventional medical doctors. Alternative medicines seemingly have always existed, changing and conforming to the current climate of society. There seems to be an almost endless number of alternative medicines, each with their own method of gaining perfect health. Often people who are dissatisfied with conventional medicine turn to alternative medicine for their medical needs. Many similarities link the diverse extremities of alternative medicine. These therapies have proved to be of much benefit in supporting the normal healing course of the body. Even though there are many modern alternative remedies, with different beliefs, all of them operate under some common principles. One of these principles is that the body has the capacity to heal naturally and maintain stability (Paquette, 2000). The other one is that adverse health conditions can occur as a result of factors emanating from mind, emotions and the body. Alternative medicine, according to Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, (2002), focuses on determining the chief cause of a particular condition, and dealing with the whole person rather that concentrating on symptoms. If a person pays close attention to his/her health he/she can contribute to his/her wellbeing. Alternative medicine holds firmly to the principle that one treatment cannot be used for all people even though they may be suffering from the same condition. Each and every person as per alternative medicine has distinct bodily, mind and spiritual make up (Goldberg, Trivieri and Anderson, 2002). "}
