The pMN is highly sensitive and specific for detecting virus-specific neutralizing antibodies against influenza viruses and can be used to assess antibody functionality in vitro. Here we show the production of these viral HA pseudotypes and their employment as substitutes for wildtype viruses in influenza neutralization assays. We demonstrate their utility in detecting serum responses to vaccination with the ability to evaluate cross-subtype neutralizing responses elicited by specific vaccinating antigens.

Only influenza A (IAV) and influenza B (IBV) viruses are endemic in the global human population, rapidly spreading around the world in seasonal epidemics, imposing considerable economic burden and death [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00741), [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00741)]. From its wild bird reservoir, IAV is able to transmit from domestic poultry [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00741)], which is the gateway to infection of mammals, most notably, swine and humans [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00741)]. IBV's natural reservoir is humans, however there have been reports of infection in seals [ [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00741), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00741), [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00741)], alluding to its potential to cause disease in other species. [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00741), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00741), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00741)], and neuraminidase (NA), which is involved in the release of viral progeny [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00741)]. Currently, 18 distinct antigenic HA (H1-H18) and 11 antigenic on [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00741)]. IBV is not as diverse and has been divided into two distinct lineages, B/Yamagata-like and B/Victoria-like viruses [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00741)]. [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00741), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00741), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00741)]. The HA head is highly antigenic and is subject to mutations and reassortment of genetic material over time [ [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00741), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00741), [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00741)]. Minor genetic changes such as single point mutations in the HA head are known to give rise to antigenic drift. In contrast, antigenic shift, wherein an influenza A virus strain acquires an HA or NA segment from another subtype of IAV, usually from a zoonotic reservoir, can also occur leading to the emergence of new variants or Antigenic shift is of concern as it may result in the emergence of a completely novel virus to which the human population has no pre-existing immunity and, as such, may have pandemic potential. To date only three HA (H1, H2, and H3) and two NA (N1 and N2) subtypes are known have caused human pandemics [ [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00741), [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00741), [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00741), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00741)]. However, this does not preclude other subtypes from causing a pandemic in the human population in the future. There have been numerous documented cases of human infection with highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (HPAI) H5 and H7, viral subtypes that predominantly cause outbreaks poultry [ [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00741), [35](#B35-vaccines-09-00741), [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00741), [37](#B37-vaccines-09-00741)]. Nonetheless, these incidences have not yet resulted in these viruses acquiring the ability to sustain human to human transmission [ [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00741), [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00741), [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00741)]. Whilst antigenic divergence both within and across HA subtypes exists, the HA stem domain is more conserved and, although not as immunogenic as the head domain [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00741), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00741)], is increasingly being explored as a candidate for universal influenza vaccines [ [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00741), [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00741)]. As such, the importance of studying HA structure and function and monitoring antigenic changes within HA is critical to understanding antigenic evolution, defining the most antigenically relevant antigens for annual human vaccination programs [ [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00741), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00741)], determining potent universal vaccine targets [ [44](#B44-vaccines-09-00741), [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00741)], developing vaccines for veterinary use [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00741), [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00741)], and improving influenza diagnosis and therapeutic interventions [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00741), [48](#B48-vaccines-09-00741), [49](#B49-vaccines-09-00741), [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00741)]. [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00741), [52](#B52-vaccines-09-00741)]. The HI test works by measuring the interaction between the serum antibody and the influenza HA domain of currently circulating IAV and IBV strains and the resulting inhibition of red blood cell agglutination and is currently the measure for seroconversion and protection [ [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00741), [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00741), [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00741), [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00741)]. To improve current vaccination strategies and to aid the development of a universal influenza vaccine, additional reliable tools are necessary to identify and progress promising candidates targeting both the hemagglutinin head and stem domains [ [49](#B49-vaccines-09-00741), [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00741), [57](#B57-vaccines-09-00741), [58](#B58-vaccines-09-00741)]. The advent of pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have enabled the study of HA interactions with antibodies, drugs, and host cell receptors with ease [ [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00741), [59](#B59-vaccines-09-00741), [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00741), [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00741)]. These pseudotypes (PV) undergo abortive replication and do not give rise to replication-competent progeny [ [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00741), [63](#B63-vaccines-09-00741)]. While it is logistically possible to deal with low pathogenic strains of influenza, studies on strains that are exotic and not widespread in the population are considerably hampered by the availability of BSL facilities and highly trained and qualified personnel required for handling and processing these viruses. [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00741)], with the goal of employing these PV as tools to further vaccine R&D that will contribute to reducing the burden of seasonal influenza, minimizing the risk of zoonotic influenza, and mitigating the impact of pandemic influenza. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Plasmid Production and Transformation [65](#B65-vaccines-09-00741)]. phCMV1 is a constitutive mammalian gene expression vector driven by a modified hCMV immediate-early promoter and enhancer/intron together with a Simian Vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) promoter with KanR and selection of plasmid-positive prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. pEVAC is also a mammalian expression vector with an hCMV immediate-early promoter/enhancer followed hormone (BGH) polyadenylation sequence, and KanR gene. All HA genes were gene-optimized and adapted to human codon use using the GeneOptimizer algorithm [ [66](#B66-vaccines-09-00741)] and have a strong Kozak-initiation motif. 2.2. Propagation and Maintenance of Cell Cultures 2.3. Production of Influenza HA Pseudotypes (PV) [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00741), [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00741)]. Briefly, 4 \u00d7 105 HEK 293T/17 cells in complete DMEM were seeded per well of a 6-well plate and incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 overnight. The next day, media was replaced and cells were transfected using Opti-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific HD reagent (Promega of low and other subtypes with a monobasic cleavage site, an plasmid II human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) [ [68](#B68-vaccines-09-00741)] was also included. For subtype, 50 ng of A/flat-faced bat/Peru/033/2010/N11 in pEVAC was also included. The amounts of plasmid DNA and reagents used for transfection in a single well of a 6-well plate are indicated in [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00741-t001). All plasmid DNA were combined in Opti-MEM and FuGENE\u00ae HD added dropwise followed by incubation for 15 min. The plasmid DNA-OptiMEM mixture was then added to the cells with constant swirling. At least 8 h post-transfection, 1 unit of exogenous neuraminidase (Sigma AldrichN2876, Paisley, UK) was added to the 6 well-plates, with the exception of the H18 subtype. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, supernatants were collected, passed through a 0.45 m filter, and stored at 80 \u00b0C. 2.4. Influenza Pseudotype Titration were generated by immunizing chickens (OIE) and sheep (NIBSC) with HA antigen. At the time of publication, reference antisera for H17 and H18 were not available, however, frugivorous bat sera, collected as part of a bat sera surveillance program in Nigeria, was provided by APHA. 2.6. Mouse Immunogenicity Studies [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00741-f001)). Mice were weighed daily and monitored for any signs of disease or distress. Mice were bled at 42 days post immunization (dpi), 56 dpi, and 70 dpi ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00741-f001)). At 70 days post immunization, all mice were culled and terminal bleeds collected. Collected blood was left to clot for 1 h at room temperature and serum was separated via centrifugation at 2000\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and stored at 20 \u00b0C. 2.7. Pseudotype Microneutralization [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00741)]. 2.8. Statistical Analysis 2.9. Bioinformatic Analysis [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00741)]. The resulting tree file was then visualized using the Archaeopteryx tree viewer in the Influenza Resource Database (IRD) [ [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00741)]. 3. Results 3.1. Production of the IAV and IBV Pseudotype Library [Section 2.3](#sec2dot3-vaccines-09-00741)). All PV were produced with the following three plasmids: (i) a plasmid containing packaging genes from a surrogate lentivirus (HIV) (gag-pol), which is defective for the native HIV envelope, (ii) a plasmid expressing the HA envelope of the strain being studied (IAV or IBV), and (iii) a transfer plasmid expressing the of exogenous neuraminidase (exoNA) was added per well to facilitate viral egress, with the PV containing the HA envelope on its surface, harvested in cell supernatants. For influenza H18, an additional plasmid expressing A/flat-faced bat/Peru/033/2010/N11 was included in the place of exogenous NA [73](#B73-vaccines-09-00741), [74](#B74-vaccines-09-00741), [75](#B75-vaccines-09-00741)]. As demonstrated previously, an additional plasmid expressing protease was protease plasmid DNA requiring optimization for each PV produced. We found that this is dependent on the HA subtype and occasionally the strain being produced ( [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-00741-f003), [Table 3](#vaccines-09-00741-t003)). Optimization was achieved system for protease amounts ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00741-f002)b), and a fixed amount of all other plasmids was used to transfect 293T/17 cells. For all strains except HPAI strains, initial transfections were undertaken with human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) in the top three wells and transmembrane serine protease 4 (TMPRSS 4) in the bottom three wells of the 6-well plate. Protease plasmid was added at a ratio to the HA plasmid ( [Figure 2](#vaccines-09-00741-f002)b), i.e., for every 10 ng of HA, we tested with 10 ng, 5 ng, and 2.5 ng protease DNA. All PV all subtypes except for H17 and IBV lineages, where HAT produced the highest titres and H2, H3, and H4 [Table Protease was not necessary for the production viruses, H5 and H7 in [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-00741-f003)and [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00741-t002)(as indicated by *). Optimized conditions were then recorded and PV production was scaled up to produce larger PV stocks. We showed here ( [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-00741-f003), [Table 3](#vaccines-09-00741-t003)) the highest titres we achieved rounds of PV production following optimization. PV titre variability between batches was found to be small, with titres achieved within half a log of each other. [Figure 4](#vaccines-09-00741-f004)illustrates the range of IAV subtypes already present and available in this library. Full details of the current library at the VPU are indicated in [Table S1](#app1-vaccines-09-00741). These include low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) strains from H7, in addition [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00741-t002)) was assessed. All reference antisera were able to neutralize the subtype homologous PV they were tested against ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-09-00741-f005)). We showed neutralization dose response curves for PV representing IAV strains, which were reported as the cause of human disease, including avian subtypes that caused zoonotic infection without being associated with sustained human to human transmission (HPAI H5 and H7, and H9), with IC50 dilution values ranging from the most potent, ~14521 for H1, and the least potent, ~416 for H3 ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-09-00741-f005)a). We also tested against HA PV that have been associated with swine and human infection, such as H1 strains that have been found in pigs, which may acquire the ability to transmit to humans due to possible antigenic shift ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-09-00741-f005)b), and avian IAV subtypes that are found in their natural reservoir, wild, and occasionally domesticated, birds ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-09-00741-f005)c) and may evolve in the future to cause novel pandemic strains in humans. Antisera used herein have IC50 dilution values that are comparatively higher than the IC50 values for HA subtypes associated with human disease (ranging from ~13,000 for H14 to ~900 for H13). Currently there is no commercially available H17 or H18 subtype antisera. Due to the association of H17 in frugivorous bat species, sera collected from bats in Nigeria, as provided by the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), were assessed against the H17 pseudotype ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-09-00741-f005)d). Three bats within a larger panel (only five samples shown here) neutralized the H17 PV with similar IC50 dilution values of 724, respectively. ( 5](#vaccines-09-00741-f005)d). Human IBV PV from both Yamagata and Victoria-like lineages were also to neutralization antisera ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-09-00741-f005)e). Antisera to pre-split IBV strains were this study, nonetheless, our representative pre-split IBV (B/Hong Kong/73) strain was neutralized anti-Victoria reference sera. However, this PV was more susceptible to neutralization by antisera generated using HA from the Victoria-like lineage than the Yamagata-like lineage ( [Table S2](#app1-vaccines-09-00741). 3.3. Mouse Immunogenicity Studies 3.3.1. Monitoring of the Immune Response throughout the Vaccination Protocol [Figure 1](#vaccines-09-00741-f001)). It should be noted that all mice used for our experiments were na\u00efve and have not had prior exposure to influenza, hence it is assumed that neutralization of PV will be due to the immune response generated by immunization with influenza antigens. [Figure 6](#vaccines-09-00741-f006)). At 42 dpi, mice had received three immunizations (day 0, day 14, and day 28) and had already developed neutralizing antibody responses compared to day 0 ( [Figure 6](#vaccines-09-00741-f006)a). At 56 and 70 dpi, mice had received four immunizations (day 0, day 14, day 28, and day 42) ( [Figure 6](#vaccines-09-00741-f006)b,c). A significant increase in detectable neutralizing antibodies can be seen between the third and fourth round of immunizations ( [Figure 6](#vaccines-09-00741-f006)d) demonstrating that boosting the immune response with subsequent immunizations may give rise to stronger neutralizing titres. There was no significant difference between neutralizing activity of mouse sera from bleeds taken at 56 and 70 dpi ( [Figure 6](#vaccines-09-00741-f006)d), suggesting that we had employed an ideal number and interval of immunizations of pEVAC HA to strain-specific [Figure 7](#vaccines-09-00741-f007)a). We tested against a previous H1 pandemic strain, SC/1918 (Spanish flu), and a possible emerging pandemic strain, swine/BJ/18, guided by the knowledge that the last H1N1 pandemic (swine flu) was caused by a quadruple-reassortant virus, containing genes from Asian and European swine, North American avian, and human influenza virus [ [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00741)]. Terminal sera from mice immunized with EN/09 were able to neutralize all H1 PV tested, with no significant difference observed in neutralization activity against homologous and heterologous strains of the same subtype, with representative PV strains covering 100 years, from 1918 to 2018 ( [Figure 7](#vaccines-09-00741-f007)a). H5 strains have been known to cause deadly outbreaks in poultry with some human spillover in the past [ [77](#B77-vaccines-09-00741), [78](#B78-vaccines-09-00741)]. H5 viruses especially those in clade 2 are known to evolve rapidly and extensively, with newly emerging strains circulating in many regions of the world [ [78](#B78-vaccines-09-00741)]. Our findings here demonstrate that terminal sera from mice immunized with gyr/WA/15 (H5) were unable to neutralize the other H5 PV tested as effectively as the homologous strain used for vaccination ( [Figure 7](#vaccines-09-00741-f007)b). Interestingly, one mouse developed a broadly neutralizing response and was able to neutralize all PV tested except for IN/05 but all other samples revealed response ( the PV, we tested against four other H7 strains, FPV/RO/1934, the historical H7 fowl plague virus of 1934, a human IAV PV, AH/13, and two avian PV, sera from mice immunized with SH/13 were able to neutralize all H7 PV tested, with no significant difference observed in the means of the IC50 dilution values obtained against homologous and heterologous strains of the same subtype ( [Figure 7](#vaccines-09-00741-f007)c). Some serum samples were unable to neutralize all three H7 avian PV, but all serum terminal bleeds were effective against the other H7 human PV tested, AH/13, with neutralization of the homologous strain showing the same pattern ( [Figure 7](#vaccines-09-00741-f007)c). [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00741), [79](#B79-vaccines-09-00741)]. To test this, we examined cross strain neutralization in mice vaccinated with antigens from strains of IAV H3 isolated from human and avian origins. H3 circulates in the human population and is a component of the quadrivalent influenza vaccine, transmission is often from animal sources [ [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00741), [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00741)], and therefore cross-reactive immune responses would be beneficial. [Figure 8](#vaccines-09-00741-f008)). Terminal sera from mice were tested against two avian H3 PV matched to the immunization antigens, rtn/DE/17 and representative human strain PV, A/Udorn/307/1972 (H3). [Figure 8](#vaccines-09-00741-f008), 1st panel) were able to neutralize a homologous PV (rtn/DE/17) with an IC50 dilution range of 413-8634. These mice were also able to neutralize a heterologous PV duc/QN/14 with no significant difference compared to sera from mice vaccinated with the duc/QN/14 antigen ( [Figure 8](#vaccines-09-00741-f008), 2nd panel). Only one mouse from the group vaccinated with rtn/DE/17 produced responses that were able to neutralize human H3 PV, A/Udorn/307/1972 ( [Figure 8](#vaccines-09-00741-f008), 3rd panel), whereas, all mice vaccinated with duc/QN/14 were able to neutralize A/Udorn/307/1972. This is promising as vaccination with an avian H3 has shown neutralization of a human H3 PV, albeit an older strain from 1972. Mice immunized with SA/19, a human H3 antigen, did not neutralize any of the PV tested except for serum from one mouse, which was able to neutralize PV rtn/DE/17 (IC50 dilution of 5659). Sera from half of immunized with SZ/17 were able to neutralize PV rtn/DE/17 and two mice were able to neutralize duc/QN/14 and A/Udorn/307/1972 PV. Our results show that vaccination with duc/QN/14 elicited the best immune responses against all H3 PV tested, either avian or subtype specific antigens had very little effect against other strains from that same subtype. This is what is observed in seasonal vaccination that generates subtype-specific antibodies that will have little or no efficacy against drifted strains [ [80](#B80-vaccines-09-00741), [81](#B81-vaccines-09-00741)]. An immunization that gives rise to broadly protective humoral immunity against influenza remains a sought-after goal [ [82](#B82-vaccines-09-00741)]. It has been previously described that cross-protective immunity against pandemic H1N1 (2009) can be induced by seasonal influenza A (H3N2) infection [ [83](#B83-vaccines-09-00741)]. Here we attempted to demonstrate cross-subtype neutralization from immunization among IAV subtypes that are closest to each other on the phylogenetic tree for IAV ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-09-00741-f004)) B/Yamagata-like viruses panel), mice vaccinated with npd/CA/16 (H7) showed no significant difference in neutralizing activity (n.s.) with mice vaccinated with duc/VN/18 (H7) when tested against the duc/VN/18 (H7) PV. This was also observed with (H10) and duc/BD/15 (H15) ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)a, 1st pintail duck/CA/16 (H7), mrd/UT/18 (H10), and duc/BD/15 (H15) produced a to the homologous antigen against the duc/VN/18 (H7) PV in vitro. Mice vaccinated with the other antigens, duc/BD/15 (H10) and wts/WAUS/79 (H15), showed little to no neutralization of the H7 PV, this may be partly due to this H15 virus being isolated in 1979, suggesting that this avian H15 diverged between 1979 and 2018 ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)a, 1st panel). [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)a, 2nd panel), with only groups vaccinated with H10 antigens showing neutralizing activity against the PV. There was also no significant difference between the IC50 values against the mrd/UT/18 (H10) PV in the group vaccinated with the other H10, duc/BD/15, to that vaccinated with the homologous mrd/UT/18 (H10) ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)a, 2nd panel). Here, only neutralization of PV by mice vaccinated with the same subtype is demonstrated. Looking at the phylogenetic tree ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-09-00741-f004)), H10 resides on a different branch than H7 and H15, and therefore it was highly unlikely that cross-subtype neutralization would be observed. [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)a, 3rd panel). Neutralizing activity of mice vaccinated with all other antigens tested was closer to that of the negative control group (PBS), although a few responders, located above the upper extreme quartile, were observed. [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)b, 1st panel), mice vaccinated with rds/CL/16 (H11) showed no significant difference in neutralizing activity (n.s.) with mice vaccinated with cnt/NL/15 (H11) when tested against the cnt/NL/15 (H11) PV. This suggests that vaccination with rds/CL/16 (H11) produces the same neutralizing response as its homologous antigen against the cnt/NL/15 (H11) PV in vitro. Mice vaccinated with both H13 antigens showed very little neutralization against the H11 PV, with only two mice of the lgl/NJ/17(H13) group and one mouse from the rbg/MN/17 (H13) group showing neutralization though IC50 values that were closer to the negative control group ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)b, 1st panel). There was no neutralization of the H11 PV by mice vaccinated with H16 antigens, mgl/SCA/18 (H16) and bhg/NL/16 (H16), suggesting that this antigen did not elicit significant responses to epitopes that are common to both the H11 and H16 IAV strains. [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)b, 2nd panel), mice vaccinated with H11 antigens produced poor neutralizing responses. However, similar to what we observed in the H11 PV neutralization ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)b, 1st panel), there was no significant difference between the IC50 values of groups vaccinated with the other H13, rbg/MN/17 (H13), to those vaccinated with lglNJ/17 neutralizing activity was observed in sera from mice vaccinated with both H16 antigens with no significant difference between the IC50 values of these groups with those vaccinated with the homologous lgl/NJ/17 (H13) against the lgl/NJ/17 (H13) PV ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)b, 2nd panel). It is of note here that low level background neutralization was observed in the sera of the negative control group against lgl/NJ/17 (H13) PV, this was not seen when this group was tested against the H11 or H16 PV, reasons for this are currently unclear. [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)b, 3rd panel). Vaccinations with the other and both H13 antigens achieved IC50 titres that had no significant difference (n.s.) compared to the homologous mgl/SCA/18 panel). Neutralizing in the sera of mice immunized with H11 antigens, albeit not as strong as that of the homologous ones, nonetheless these responses were significantly different from the negative control mice sera (p < 0.05) ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)b, 3rd panel). [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)c, 1st panel) (n = 5 for all groups), no neutralization was observed in sera from mice regardless of the antigen they had been inoculated with including the pre-split antigen B/Singapore/1972 (B/SG/1972). None of the groups showed responses that were significantly different from sera collected from mice in the negative control group (PBS), which, incidentally, was showing some background against this PV. Most of the mice that were vaccinated with any of the antigens tested failed to reach 50% neutralization against the pre-split PV ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)c, 1st panel). [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)c, 2nd = 5), sera from mice vaccinated with B/SG/1972 (pre-split) did not show any neutralization, except for one outlier that was outside the upper extreme quartile. Neutralization was observed for sera from all other groups including, as expected, those vaccinated with the antigen from Yamagata-like lineage (B/PHK/13) ( [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)b, 2nd panel). Nonetheless, vaccination employing these antigens did not produce strong neutralizing responses against the B/Yam PV, as responses showed no significant difference with the PBS group, with IC50 dilution values ranging from 0.1 to 100. [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)c, 3rd panel) were interesting; as sera from mice in all groups were able to neutralize this B/Vic PV. Sera from mice vaccinated with B/SG/1972 other B/Vic antigen, B/CO/17, achieved IC50 dilution values, which had no significant difference (n.s) compared to that vaccinated with the homologous B/Bri/08 (B/Vic) against the B/Bri/08 (B/Vic) PV (p > 0.05). Sera from mice vaccinated with antigens from the other lineage, B/PHK/13 (B/Yam), achieved IC50 titres that were higher than those observed for mice from the group vaccinated with homologous B/Bri/08 (B/Vic) antigen (* p < 0.05) against B/Bri/08 (B/Vic) PV. This suggests that vaccination with either pre-split, B/Yam or B/Vic lineage antigens produces a significant neutralizing response against this B/Victoria PV. 3.4. In Vitro Neutralization of HA broadly monoclonal antibodies have been developed for use in immunotherapy against influenza. Monoclonal antibody CR9114 binds to IBV from both lineages and additionally binds influenza A viruses from both group 1 and group 2 [ [85](#B85-vaccines-09-00741)], and FI6 is a pan-influenza A neutralizing antibody [ [84](#B84-vaccines-09-00741)]. Both CR9114 and FI6 bind to a highly conserved epitope in the HA stem [ [84](#B84-vaccines-09-00741), [85](#B85-vaccines-09-00741)] enabling them to broadly neutralize influenza viruses and providing protection against a lethal influenza challenge in vivo. Here, we show neutralization of representative IAV obtained by normalizing the RLU values against that of the pseudotype only controls corresponding to 0% neutralization and cell-only (no virus) controls corresponding to 100% neutralization. A non-linear regression (curve fit) analysis on the normalized data using a log (inhibitor) versus normalized response variable slope equation to compute for the IC50 values was then carried out. The IC50 values for CR9114 against all IAV PV tested [Table 4](#vaccines-09-00741-t004)). The IC50 values for previously detected in the human population, including A(H1N1), A(H2N2), and A(H3N2), strains of which have previously caused global pandemics. Both mAbs were also able to neutralize all influenza PV representative strains from known avian subtypes for both the Group I (H6, CR9114 and FI6 showed no neutralization activity against any of the influenza B strains tested. This correlates with the previous findings of CR9114 being unable to neutralize influenza B viruses in vitro as tested using the classic microneutralization and hemagglutination inhibition assays [ [85](#B85-vaccines-09-00741)]. Some neutralization activity can be seen for CR9114 against B/Phuket/3073/2013, a B/Yamagata-like virus, at the highest concentration tested (1 \u00b5g/mL), but there was no dose-response established indicating no true neutralization occurred. As FI6 is only expected to neutralize influenza A viruses, we did not test it against IBV PV. 4. Discussion [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00741)]. Viral cis-acting sequences are then introduced into the same cell, maintaining the separation of viral genes and cis-acting sequences during production. This prevents recombination, leading to the production of replication-defective particles able to specifically transduce target cells. This system has been extensively optimized by Naldini et al. to ensure that recombination does not occur and to assess for safety [ [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00741), [63](#B63-vaccines-09-00741), [67](#B67-vaccines-09-00741), [86](#B86-vaccines-09-00741)]. The HA genes are then expressed by heterologous plasmids. Once the HA sequence has been identified, this can be cloned into a suitable plasmid expression vector. Here we utilized pI.18, pEVAC, and phCMV but other plasmids could be employed and the amount of DNA required determined using the optimization described in this study. Addition of a luciferase reporter plasmid produces results that can be determined rapidly using a system, which has the potential to be upscaled to high throughput platforms. Additionally, PV can be stored at 80 \u00b0C for extended periods of time and as was shown with H5, can be lyophilized and stored for up to 4 weeks at 37 \u00b0C [ [87](#B87-vaccines-09-00741)]. Lyophilization could expand the potential to investigate and respond to pandemics or other outbreaks from any subtype at speed and without the need for cold chain storage. [Figure 5](#vaccines-09-00741-f005), [Table 2](#vaccines-09-00741-t002)). The pseudotype library was with neutralizing reference antisera ( [Figure 5](#vaccines-09-00741-f005)), and this is integral to the vaccine strain selection process for seasonal influenza vaccines. Laboratories around the world that are part of the World Health Organization global influenza surveillance and response system monitor the antigenic phenotypes of circulating viruses to select vaccine strains for upcoming influenza seasons. However, investigation of emerging strains that could cause pandemics is limited, as it is arduous to isolate and propagate the wildtype virus to test against. Our influenza pseudotype library can be employed to test protection offered by existing vaccines and antisera used in their selection, in this instance, as tools for surveillance and pandemic preparedness. [Figure 6](#vaccines-09-00741-f006)). The data generated could inform the appropriate periods between doses and the number of doses that could provide the optimal immune response. In our immune response monitoring study, we found that immunization with 50 \u00b5g of pEVAC HA four times in 2-week intervals, produced optimal titres after the 4th inoculation, with immune responses at 56 and 70 days post immunization showing no significant difference ( [Figure 6](#vaccines-09-00741-f006)d). Additionally, for vaccines, it may also be useful to explore the shortest time frame within which doses may be completed without a detrimental effect on the final immune response. Our results indicate that by employing our immunization and dosing strategy, a 4th immunization with pEVAC HA is necessary to achieve maximal titres, as lower titres were achieved with only three compared to four immunizations ( [Figure 6](#vaccines-09-00741-f006)). This could be extended in the future to explore prime boost regimens with alternative vectors or proteins. [Figure 7](#vaccines-09-00741-f007)and [Figure 8](#vaccines-09-00741-f008)). It has been previously demonstrated that virus strains, even those within the same subtype, have different neutralization susceptibilities to sera that have been identified as cross-neutralizing, suggesting factors such as availability of HA epitopes via exposure, glycoprotein shielding and their role in antigenic drift, and immune evasion may be in play [ [88](#B88-vaccines-09-00741), [89](#B89-vaccines-09-00741), [90](#B90-vaccines-09-00741), [91](#B91-vaccines-09-00741)]. Our findings provide an indication as to whether immunization with a particular strain of the subtype can neutralize drifted strains of the same subtype, which is very important for lasting vaccine efficacy and protection especially in the case of influenza. This additional testing can also provide an assessment of the robustness and breadth of the humoral immune responses elicited by the vaccine to avian and human strains of the same subtype in the case of IAV and can guide the vaccine strain or antigen selection in a vaccine to improve or maintain its protective effect. [Figure 9](#vaccines-09-00741-f009)). Here, we also selected IAV strains that are not usually studied, H10, H11, H13, H15, and H16, together with IBV from both lineages. Data from immunization protocols using these HA subtypes are very limited and to our knowledge, our group is among the first to report immune responses as a result of vaccination in these subtypes. Findings may aid in the development of a vaccine for pandemic purposes or inform possible pre-existing immune responses in the population. Immune responses generated by a vaccination with an HA antigen against the homologous PV was successful in all be used as control groups for future vaccination experiments. We found that cross-subtype protection is rare and neutralizing responses are not as strong as the homologous antigen against the PV. Several vaccinations include that of an H7 antigen that showed neutralization against an H10 and with each be hypothesized that immunogenic epitopes on the head domain of these rare HA subtypes are not under strong immune pressure in their natural avian reservoir and are unlikely to undergo genetic changes due to this pressure, but are more likely to be influenced by stochastic effects that conserve antigenic site sequences [ [92](#B92-vaccines-09-00741), [93](#B93-vaccines-09-00741)]. This results in the preservation of important antigenic epitopes such as the membrane-distal receptor-binding site (RBS) on the HA head containing key highly conserved amino acids involved in receptor binding [ [94](#B94-vaccines-09-00741), [95](#B95-vaccines-09-00741), [96](#B96-vaccines-09-00741), [97](#B97-vaccines-09-00741)] and can partially explain cross-subtype neutralization seen in our vaccination results. Nevertheless, our pseudotype library has enabled us to test immune responses brought about by vaccination against a variety of IAV and IBV pseudotypes. This is a promising in vitro screening tool to guide preclinical studies. [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00741)], the use of recombinant monoclonal antibodies that are broadly neutralizing against influenza is a promising strategy to counter annual epidemics and pandemic threats especially in individuals with severe disease. These mAbs, several of which are already in clinical development, bind to functionally conserved epitopes such as those in the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) stem, thereby providing strain independent protection [ [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00741), [84](#B84-vaccines-09-00741), [85](#B85-vaccines-09-00741), [98](#B98-vaccines-09-00741), [99](#B99-vaccines-09-00741)]. For a time, discovery of these broadly neutralizing antibodies has been hampered by the lack of assays to properly show neutralization afforded by these mAbs that is exclusive from hemagglutination inhibition of HA-head directed antibodies. Antibodies that target the HA stem do not inhibit hemagglutination inhibition [ [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00741)] and are thought to neutralize influenza via other mechanisms. We successfully employed our pseudotype library to investigate the neutralizing activity of HA stem-directed CR9114 and FI6 against representative IAV and IBV PV available. For instance, we could confirm that CR9114, despite binding to IBV HA, does not neutralize IBV in vitro. This is an invaluable tool to test functionality of new immunotherapies against influenza in vitro. 5.
