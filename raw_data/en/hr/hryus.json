Try using this visualization meditation to send positive energy to someone. Healing Meditation to Send Positive Energy Before you begin: Set your intention. Do you wish to help someone deal with their mental health struggles, help them to stick to healthy habits, or heal a specific physical ailment? Choose your intention and select the specific person that you would like to receive your energy. Refer to this intention throughout your visualization or whenever your mind begins to wander. Create a relaxing environment. Set out [candles](https://spells8.com/candle-colors-and-their-meanings/) and dim the lights, burn incense, and create a comfortable space to sit, if you so choose. If you're able, play a solfeggio frequency to assist in your healing intention. For example, listening to 528 Hz is said to have a healing effect on the physical body, while 852 Hz may help you to form positive thoughts and awaken your highest self. If you don't have access to recordings of these frequencies, you can put on some calming, quiet music or white noise to set the mood - nothing too distracting. Cleanse your space. Make sure your area is free from unwanted energy by burning incense, smudging, or performing a sound bath.
