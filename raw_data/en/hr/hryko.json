They are not influenced by money or self-interest.\" \"This is, of course, nonsense,\" he wrote. There is a reason \"pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars on the influencing, education, and entertainment of doctors around the world.\" As discussed in my video [Find Out If Your Doctor Takes Drug Company Money](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/find-out-if-your-doctor-takes-drug-company-money/), the vast majority of physicians in the United States [take](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17460228) gifts from the pharmaceutical industry, and, ironically, cardiologists, whose practice centers around diseases that can largely be prevented and treated with lifestyle changes, receive the most payments of all. A previous compilation of surveys from the 1980s and 1990s [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10647801) that, on average, doctors met face-to-face with drug industry representatives about once a week. Today, your family doctor may [meet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17460228) with drug company employees on average 16 times a month. There are only 20 workdays a month, so that's nearly every day. What does the public think about this? Only about half even [appear](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21671130) to know what's going on. Therefore, \"if 83% of doctors receive gifts, it is likely that a significant percentage of patients are not aware that their personal physician receives industry gifts.\" We're not just talking about a token Viagra paperweight or soap dispenser. For marketing, pharmaceutical companies [spend](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17356984) $15,000 per physician every year, making conflicts of interest one of the most pressing problems in American health care. How do doctors feel about it? Most generally approve of the gifts. However, tellingly, physicians don't want gift relationships made public. \"Physicians' disagreement that it is inappropriate to accept gifts, but their reluctance to disclose the gift relationship to the public, [suggests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9447476) that they must recognize that the public would not appreciate the practice.\" To analyze how doctors resolve this contradiction, researchers [conducted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17356984) a series of physician focus groups. It turns out physicians use a variety of denials and rationalizations, including avoiding thinking about it, and denying responsibility. Physicians readily acknowledged the inherent conflict of interest, but this didn't stop them. In fact, some complained that the gifts were getting more modest. \"We [doctors] tend to [deny](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24246393) that we have any conflict of interest if a pharmaceutical company buys us a nice dinner. We tend to insist that it won't affect our judgement in any way\"\u2014as if drug companies just like wasting money for the heck of it. Most physicians contend that their colleagues are susceptible to industry influence...but not them. Though physicians don't want these gift relationships to be public, that's just too bad. Thanks to Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, the Sunshine Act was [inserted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Everything+you+need+to+know+about+the+sunshine) into Obamacare. \"For the first time, patients will now be able to see what, if any, financial ties their own doctor has with a drug or device maker.\" Doctors can't hide anymore. The Sunshine Act was designed to give patients some insights when choosing a provider, and law enforcement agencies can also use it to see who's getting money from industry to investigate illegal kickback schemes. Right now, it might just be embarrassing, but this could allow attorneys general to go after doctors to see the kinds of incentives they may be getting for writing a lot of prescriptions. The database is live right now at [openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/search/physicians](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/search/physicians) or, for a more user-friendly version, [Propublica's Dollars for Docs page](https://projects.propublica.org/docdollars/). The drug industry [spends](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Sunshine+act+to+add+more+transparency) billions trying to influence doctors, and, for the first time, you can see if your physician, or any physician, has their hand out. Senator Grassley [hoped](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25797085) this would help save our nation money. It could [reduce](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=sunlight+as+disinfectant+-+new+rules) healthcare costs if patients viewed such doctors as less trustworthy and chose doctors less in bed with industry. It could also change physician behavior: Physicians may want to avoid financial relationships with companies to guard against patient distrust or becoming the target of an expose or investigation. Or they could just try to cover it up. The American Academy of Family Physicians [advised](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24134101) physicians how to \"avoid getting burned\" by the Sunshine Act. For example, drug companies now have to report when they give doctors free meals valued over $10. So, should family physicians just stop accepting free food from drug companies? No way! You just have to give the drug sales reps the right head count to ensure that the meal cost dips below $10 per person. The former long-time editor of the New England Journal of Medicine [said](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Disclosure%E2%80%99s+Failings%3A+What+Is+the) it best: \"Although the spotlight has been on the failure to disclose (or adequately disclose) financial relationships with industry, the problem with [conflicts of interest] is not the lack of disclosure but the existence of the conflict itself.\" Rather than just disclosing them, the best approach to financial conflicts is to have none. No wonder physicians undervalue lifestyle interventions!

And, even worse, sometimes the drugs can do more harm than good. See my video on [How Doctors Responded to Being Named a Leading Killer](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-doctors-responded-to-being-named-a-leading-killer/). Financial arrangements can affect prescribing behavior for more than just drugs. See my video [Should We All Get Colonoscopies Starting at Age 50?](https://nutritionfacts.org/video/should-we-all-get-colonoscopies-starting-at-age-50/). PS: I have never knowingly accepted gifts from the pharmaceutical industry, but \"knowingly\" is an important caveat. If you search for my name in the Dollars for Docs database you'll see I apparently accepted money from a vision care company five years ago. I was giving a continuing medical education lecture at an optometric physicians conference and unbeknownst to me they had the corporation pay for my travel and lodging.
