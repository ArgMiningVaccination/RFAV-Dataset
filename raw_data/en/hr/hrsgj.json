Keywords: lifestyle medicine, chronic disease, inflammation, e pigenetics, research methodologies, in silico modeling, nutrition, physical activity INTRODUCTION A recent 60-years review of mortality in the United States, with special focus on the past two decades, revealed declining life expectancy that is particularly pronounced in ages 25-44, typically Americans' most productive years. The primary cause s of this increase in midlife mortality were unhealthy behavi ors, such as drug and alcohol use, suicides, hypertensive disease s, diabetes, and obesity which collectively have taken a (larg ely preventable) toll on both the length and quality of life of Americansrelativetopeersinotherhigh-incomecountries( 1). The disparity between leading causes of death and federal research spending was recently highlighted in a review of the U.S National Institutes of Health (NIH) Prevention Research Portfolio for the period 2012-2017 ( 2). Eleven-thousand studies characterized as primary or secondary research stud ies, comprising 17% of total NIH research spending, were identied for analysis. Only 26% of those studies addressed a leading cause of death as the outcome of interest (e.g., heart diseas e, cancer, injury, etc.). One third of the studies addressed on e of the leading risk factors for death, such as diet, tobacco use , high blood pressure, weight, elevated blood sugar, and high cholesterol. A third addressed the leading causes of disabi lity. Randomized,placebo-controlledinterventionaltrials,th ehighest level of evidence for clinical interventions, comprised 25% of spending. Only 3% of the studies addressed multiple risk factors or behaviors (as they typically co-occur in a population );20% involved youth; 10% studied elderly, urban populations or women, particularly pregnant women; 5% or fewer of the studies focused on low income, rural, sexual and gender, underrepresented race/ethnicity groups, institutionalized , or the disabled populations. Essentially no studies evaluated the use of lifestyle interventions to treat and reverse the majo r chronic diseases that increasingly are the primary root caus es of premature mortality and costly morbidity. This disparity is especially glaring given the major advances across a host of basic and translational science methodologies that have rec eived extensiveNIHfundingandhavehelpedsetthestageforPrecisi on Medicineapplicationacrossawiderangeofdiseases. Lifestyle Medicine addresses the use of a whole-food, plant-predominant diet, regular physical activity, restorati ve sleep, stress management, avoidance of risky substances and positive emotions/social connection as a primary therapeutic modality for treatment and reversal of chronic disease ( 3). Given the aforementioned paucity of studies focused on lifestyle medicine and the rapid methodological advances impacting numerous aspects of the biomedical enterprise, leading national experts were invited to review existing knowledge and gaps relating lifestyle behaviors to common chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes , cancer, inflammatory- and immune-related disorders and other conditions. The 2-days Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit ( 4) prioritized major research questions from basic science to population health.

Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit Recommendations FIGURE 1 | Lifestyle-associated pathogenesis, interventions, and e merging methods for lifestyle medicine research. Unhealth y lifestyles cause dysregulation in the microbiome, epigenetic changes, and various types of cellu lar stress and injury which, together, drive inflammation. In t urn, inflammation can drive further derangements in the microbiome, can cause distinct epigene tic changes, and can drive further cellular stress and injur y. This positive feedback leads to a process wherein inflammation becomes chronic and self-sustaining, u ltimately resulting in chronic diseases, such as Type 2 diab etes. The non-linear nature of these processes means that simple reductionist approaches to understandin g the connections between lifestyle mismanagement and chro nic disease are likely to fail. Effective lifestyle interventions prevent, treat, and reverse common chronic d iseases. To accelerate the adoption and dissemination of cl inical lifestyle medicine interventions, there is a need for cutting edge biological and computational approac hes decipher this complexity.

Innovative rese arch methodologies considered included new approaches to clinica l trials design, in silico(computer) modeling, and opportunities for population-based and/or banked serological/specimen investigations using existing cohorts. The foundational a nd synergistic roles of sociocultural influences, built enviro nment, and environmental exposures as well as the need to focus on underserved and understudied populations were also emphasized.Notably,theSummitwastherstlifestylemedic ine meetingwithsowide-ranginganinterdisciplinaryscope. The potential clinical impact of applying lifestyle medicine practicestotheleadingcausesofdiseasebeginsbyundersta nding theirbiologicalimpact,especiallyonthecommon,inflammati on- mediated e (5,6) [Figure1; adapted from Figure 3, Bodai et al. ( 5) with permission from The Permanente Press]. The health eects of diet, sedentary lifestyle, chronic stress, medica tions (often used to treat lifestyle-determined conditions), an d other aspects of lifestyle (sleep, substance use, emotions and attitudes, positive psychology and social connection) are mediated through common subcellular, epigenetic, andother mechanisms and to create dysbiosis (a state in which gastrointestinal flora become unbalanced or perturbed), cell ular stress and injury (often in the form of oxidative stress). These biological pathways often culminate in the inflammatory response, which then feeds back to drive further cellular stress, dysbiosis, and related epigenetic changes to create a self-sustaining state of chronic inflammation. In turn, chr onic systemic inflammation is an early precursor for heart disease; Type 1 and 2 diabetes and depression; and a variety of other endocrine, autoimmune, rheumatologic, and neurolog ical disorders ( Figure1). A multitude of computational and systems biology approaches are elucidating the interconnections amon g theseprocessesinthecontextofspecicdiseasesanddistincts ub- populations.

Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit Recommendations means to address health, medical care, and population health challenges. The overarching goal of the Summit was to inform the research community as well as public and private funding agencies. It sought to \"close the gap\" between what is known and what needs to be discovered to accelerate the further development and deployment of lifestyle medicine practices primarilybutnotexclusivelyintheclinicalsetting. FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF COMMON PATHWAYS: INFLAMMATION, EPIGENOMICS, THE MICROBIOME, AND NEUROPLASTICITY Inflammation, a prototypical complex system with positive and negative feedbacks ( 7), plays a key role in linking lifestyle (mis)management to downstream pathobiology ( 8) (Figure1). Inflammation is an adaptive response to stress that regulates multiple physiological processes, including t he immune response, both positively and negatively ( 8). In turn, inflammation is itself regulated at multiple levels, includi ng a newly appreciated role with metabolites such as glucose and lactate(9)andforrelatedepigeneticchanges( 10)thatareaected bylifestyle(e.g.diet)( 11)(Figure1).Furthermore,inflammation regulates - and is regulated by - changes in the microbiome (Figure1) and, ultimately, by neural circuits that also regulate the microbiome and vice versa (12). This \"neuroplasticity,\" or the changeability of brain processes and pathways formerly presumed to be \"xed,\" which is increasingly understood as a signicant component of the \"mind-body\" mechanism ( 13). Microbiome changes occur with diet, sleep, exercise, stress, addiction,andthebuiltaswellasnaturalenvironment( 14). The conceptual framework for aginghavealsochanged,from focusing only at the terminal stages of life to thinking acro ss the entire lifespan, including the construct of \"healthspan\" (i.e., the length of time that the person is healthy, not merely alive ) (15). Understanding how the body brings itself into balance (homeostasis) and the benecial eects of stress below a cert ain level (hormesis) are also areas of increasing research inte rest relatedtohealthspan.Howmuchone exercises (type,frequenc y, duration, timing, intensity, etc.) and how much (and what) one eats (pattern, timing, quality, etc.) are clearly linked t o potentially persistent epigenetic changes ( 11). We expand on theseconceptsbelow. Inflammation, a common end pathway for multiple diseases promoted by lifestyle behaviors and \"mismanagement,\" is oft en assessed using relatively non-specic biomarkers, such as C - reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Wh en studying the impact of lifestyle on specic inflammatory mediators it is important to note that correlation does not imply causality. Accordingly, there is a major need to combine targeted inflammation biomarkers (e.g., interleuk in- 6 or tumor necrosis factor- ) with an unbiased approach involving systems and computational biology that takes into consideration state-of-the-art 'omics methodology and co ncepts in order to dene the impact of lifestyle (mis)management on inflammation-associated chronic diseases ( Figure1). Asdiscussed in the following sections, this need introduces the intertwineddiscussionsofemergingcomputationalmethodo logy andappropriatestudycohorts. CURRENT AND FUTURE RESEARCH MODELS: ROLES FOR BIG DATA, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, AND IN SILICOMODELING In parallel with the growing application of computational methods to biomedicine in general, machine learning (the methodbywhichcomputersinterpretdata,alsolumpedtogether with \"Big Data\" (which refers to the increasingly large amou nt of data of multiple types obtained from multiple sources that are the starting point for machine learning) or \"Articial Intelligence\" (involving a computer's ability to make decisio ns based on data analysis that would otherwise require human intervention)( 16)havefoundincreasinguseinlifestylemedicine, predominantlyintheareaofepidemiology( Figure1;seebelow). Collectively, these approaches are based on the use of computer algorithms to generate statistically grounded models based on various correlations within data, with the goal of discover ing hidden or non-intuitive (and often non-linear) associatio ns or predictive features; there has been much discussion of the applicationofmachinelearningapproachesinmedicine,though this is still an emerging eld ( 17). Epidemiology is advancing in many directions, building upon a longstanding track record ofsuccessful applicationoftraditionalepidemiological met hods. Thepast10-15yearshavebroughtamajorparadigmshiftknown as \"Systems an d metagenomic analysis ( 12,18). These \"omics\"-based methods have been facilitated by the rapid improvements in technology andconcomitantdropincost,especiallyforgenomicsequencin g. The Big Data approach has also improved dramatically in the past 10-20 years, with initial primary focus on traditional ri sk factor analysis now expanded to high-dimensional data analysi s, network analysis, and pathway analysis ( 12,18). One key pitfall to these statistically based approaches is that many identie d associations do not necessarily reflect causal relationshi ps, though well-performed studies address key confounders and incorporate biological pathways. Another, related pitfall to th ese approaches, the so-called \"curse of dimensionality,\" is that in a very real sense the data generated are actually \"Small Data,\" wherein very large amounts of data (e.g., 400,000 DNA methylation sites) are generated from a relatively small nu mber of subjects (e.g., 400 patients, often sampled at only one or two time points), which can lead to highly over-t statistical mod els without external validation ( 19). Thus, it is dicult to try to use purely data-centered approaches to get a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic impact of lifestyle on biology andvice versa . For example, network diagrams are static representations of data that can help suggest connections an d formulatehypotheses(includinginhighlycomplexsettings, such as the brain connectome or acute inflammation). However, eve n when derived from data obtained at multiple time points, these Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 4 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 585744Vodovotz et al. Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit Recommendations static models cannot be played backward to understand where the changes came from or to discover emergent phenomena (20). An alternative approach, \"mechanistic computational modeling,\" involves encoding key interactions and mechani sms as dierential equations or \"agents\" in agent-based models. Mechanistic modeling is dynamic modeling, meaning that the models are meant to be played forward and tested against data obtained over time, and can also be played backward to gain insights as to why a given phenomenon might have occurred. This modeling approach can be used to generate \"digital twins\" (by calibrating these mechanistic models to data in individuals) and virtual population\u2014or virtual ( in silico) clinicaltrials.Notably,thesemethodswerepioneeredinst udying inflammation ( 20). Importantly, data-driven and mechanistic modeling approaches can and should be used in tandem to leverage their respective strengths while minimizing the ir weaknesses( 20). Lifestyle medicine would be a key domain wherein in silico clinical trials and other forms of \"Network Medicine\" could prove invaluable ( Figure1), since it is often neither possible to carry out true randomized controlled trials of dietary or other lifestyle modications ( 21) nor to reduce symptoms to single underlying mechanistic causes ( 20) (see also below). The use of computational models to capture the multi-factor and multi-scale organization of pathologies introduces a paradi gm in which theory-driven biology can lead totheory-driven, r ather than largely empirical, clinical interventions ( 20). Examples includeworkinstrokerehabilitation,whereneuroscience theory has been used to develop technology-driven, patient-center ed solutionsshiftinginterventionsfromperipheralmanipulati onto centralfunctionalre-organizationusingAItechniquesco mbined with virtual reality content delivery ( 22). Ultimately, however, computational models are by denition hypotheses ( 20). Both mechanisticmodelsandsomeclassesofmachinelearningmod els (e.g., a network depiction of the data), are forms of hypothese s aboutrelationships,andsothereshouldnotbeatensionbetw een thesein silico approaches and the \"pure\" hypothesis-driven approaches( 23,24). The foregoing discussion emphasizes the crucial need to dene the populations that should be studied and the types of data to be collected to facilitate in silicoapproaches. Populations exist within communities, dened either geographically or by shared demographic, cultural, behavioral or disease characteristics. The data typically used in Systems Epidemio logy analyses are derived from the subjects of cohort studies, observationalcohorts,anddietaryinterventionstudies, aswellas from electronic health records ( 25). For example, these include large and well-established cohorts, such as the Framingham HeartStudy( 26),theNurses'HealthStudy( 27),theUKBiobank (28), etc. In the past several decades, these studies have collec ted extensive data on diet, lifestyle, genetics, biomarkers, a nd health outcomes, which now also incorporates technology-derived elements, such as geographic information systems (GIS) data and other \"digital phenotyping\" data using multiple personal devices.TheAdventistHealthStudiesconductedbyLomaLin daUniversity have involved nearly 100,000 participants for more than six decades ( 29). This long-term epidemiologic research has assessed the long-term relationship between lifestyle , diet, disease, and mortality among Seventh-day Adventists. The Department of Defense (DoD) Serum Repository, in existence since 1985, collects 2 million serum specimens per year from active duty military members for surveillance of operationa lly- relevantconditions( 30).TheDoDalsoconductstheMillennium Cohort Study, initiated in 1999 to understand military serv ice members' health longitudinally both during and after a milit ary career (31). Innovative, birth-to-high school age, community- based cohorts, such as the newly launched Pittsburgh Study ( 32) create new partnerships and opportunities to understand the complexinteractionsamongindividual,family,community,a nd environmental factors that contribute to disease, educatio nal and social outcomes that are amenable to evidence-based interventions.TheNIH\"AllofUs\"Cohortstudycreatesanoth er unique opportunity to combine \"Big Data\" analytics and with state-of-the-art in silicomodeling capabilities to examine the complexinteractionsbetweengenomicsandtheenvironmenton healthanddiseaseoutcomes( 33). A major focus of any lifestyle medicine study\u2014whether observational or interventional\u2014is data quality. This is particularly important because most lifestyle data are self- reported. Keys to improving the quality of self-reported data include the use of validated and standardized questionnair es, the repeated measures of diet and lifestyle, high follow-up r ates, and the complementary use of objective biomarkers. When the eld moves into the \"omics\" era, although the genotyping data are highly accurate, the \"noise\" existing in other types of \"omics\" data (especially epigenomics and meta-genomics data) are substantial, and thus quality control and careful data analyses and interpretation are critical. An important element in understanding the biologic impact of lifestyle is the dynamics of molecular and cellular processes, which dovetails with the use of dynamic computational modeling methods ( Figure1). Intertwined with the need to obtain data at multiple time points is the need for retention of subjects in th e study cohort for years or decades, which is a major challenge . Another major challenge is the use of appropriate methodology to synthesize the vast amount of data through systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which should be conducted with caution and interpreted in light of the broader context of the eld(25). Patients exist within communities, embedded in complex interactions with their environment\u2014the social, cultural , political, pharmacological, and economic environment\u2014whic h is intrinsically connected to their lifestyle and their hea lth. This complex collection and integration of multiple personal and potentially sensitive data sources will require intensi ve eorts, and new approaches to ensure the understanding, trust, and consent of studied populations. This may be particularly challenging when partnering with groups and communities that have been underserved or understudied and discriminated against, and/or are often the most susceptibl e to Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 5 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 585744Vodovotz et al.

LIFESTYLE MEDICINE DOMAIN-SPECIFIC FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Subjectmatterexpertsforeachofthelifestylemedicinedom ains provided an overview of the current scientic knowledge and maderecommendationsforprioritizedresearchtoaccelerat ethe understanding and use of clinical application to prevent, trea t andreversethosediseases. Nutrition Overview and Prioritized Research Cardiovascular Disease The etiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been elucidatedthroughthedenitionofriskfactorsinepidemio logic studies, notably the Framingham Study, initiated in 1948 (34). Interventional trials using relatively simple diet chang es demonstrated rapid reduction of these risk factors and clini cal benets ( 35,36). Interventional trials have demonstrated how a Mediterranean eating pattern signicantly reduced cardiovascular events ( 37). More comprehensive interventions using a variety of lifestyle factors including diet have not only reduced but actually reversed existing coronary disease ( 38,39), but these studies were small and of short-duration. In contr ast to the notion that CVD occurs largely as a direct function of aging, research on the roles of dyslipidemia and inflammation creates new research opportunities for clinical and population- based interventions. Cardiovascular disease begins in chi ldhood oreveninutero,asdemonstratedwhenmotherswhohaveobesity give birth to children with thickened vasculature ( 40), perhaps even with early loss of lumbar arteries ( 41). Lifestyle medicine research should therefore prioritize children, as adult beh aviors oftenbegininchildhood. There is emerging evidence to support the benets of plant- based dietary patterns in primary prevention of CVD. Long- term epidemiologic studies have found that a healthful plant- baseddiet(thatdoesnotnecessarilyexcludeallanimalprod ucts) was associated with a signicantly lower risk of type 2 diabet es and CVD ( 42). Small intervention studies have shown that a shift from a typical western diet to a vegan diet substantially loweredaatherogenicgutflorametabolitecalledtrimethyl amine- N-oxide (TMAO) which is induced by higher consumption of animal products especially red meat ( 43). Similarly, circulating lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), an established CVD risk factor that wa s previouslythoughttobegeneticallydetermined,hasbeensh own to improve with plant-based diets ( 44). These observed health benets of plant-based dietary patterns suggest other areas o f inquiry that integrate basic, clinical, and translational research, especially when conducted within the cultural context of hig h- riskcommunities.Larger-scale,community-basedinterve ntional trials using adapted plant-based diets which are culturally sensitive to dietary traditions focusing on the African-Am erican populationsareunderway( 45).Cancer The World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute Cancer Research Fund have summarized evidence on cancer risk factors ( 46). The cancers most aected by diet and lifestyle behaviors are those of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., co lorectal) and hormonal cancers (e.g., breast and prostate). The Women's Health Initiative study (WHI) ( 47) was conducted to study cancer prevention and, while well-designed, utilized a weak dietary intervention. Thus, WHI yielded only a small dieren ce in outcomes between the intervention and control arms and did not nd signicant benets of the low-fat interventions on breast cancer incidence. However, a secondary analysis of W HI found that the low-fat pattern signicantly improved overall survivalamongpost-menopausalbreastcancerpatients( 48).On the other hand, a clinical trial of breast cancer patients tha t dramatically increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, an d ber had no appreciable eect on breast cancer recurrence or mortality( 49,50). Diabetes Type 1 diabetes (\"insulin-dependent diabetes\" as the pancreas is unabletoproduceinsulin)andType2diabetes(\"insulin-resi stant diabetes\" in which the body produces insulin but tissues are n ot abletorespondtoit)arebothstronglylinkedtonutrition. Excess adiposity is the strongest determinant of type 2 diabetes. The association of type 2 diabetes with dietary patt erns is well-established, most notably the dramatic dierence in type 2 diabetes prevalence in daily meat eaters when compared to vegans(51).Atthetissuelevel,studiesusingmagneticresonance imaging have demonstrated lipid deposition in muscle and liver cells, leading to insulin resistance ( 52). Interventional trials using plant-based diets suggest that these diets can improve a nd potentiallyevenreversethecourseofdiabetes( 53). The dietary etiology of type 1 diabetes needs to be explored further to test the various dietary factors that have been hypothesized to trigger the production of antibodies to insul in- producing cells including cow's milk ( 54), gluten, preservatives, such as nitrosamines, and low vitamin D levels. Clinical tri als have not yet explored the role of plant-based diets for type 1 diabetes prevention and management. The association of prolonged breastfeeding with low rates of type 1 diabetes also needstobeexploredfurther. Autoimmune Diseases Several studies have shown substantial benets of plant-bas ed diets for controlling rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting a ro le for dietary interventions not only for rheumatoid arthritis bu t also forauto-immunediseasesmorebroadly( 55). Hormonal Conditions Studies in the 1990's demonstrated that estrogen levels incr ease with high fat consumption and decrease with ber intake, whichisofparticularrelevanceforbreastcancer,dysmenor rhea, endometriosis,broids,andinfertility( 56). Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 6 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 585744Vodovotz et al. Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit Recommendations Brain Health and Neurological Conditions Observationalstudies( 57)havedemonstratedthatalowerintake of saturated and trans fats is associated with greatly reduc ed risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. These ndings are no w being studied with the MIND Trial ( 58), among other studies using largely plant-based diets. Short-term dietary interv entions have been shown to improve depression scores in both normal individuals ( 59) and those with depressive symptoms, the latter nding in both young ( 60) and general ( 61) populations. The dietary interventions typically reduce saturated fat and in crease consumption of plant-based foods. Randomized trials have also supported a role for aerobic exercise in the treatment of depressioninadose-relatedmanner( 62).Moreclinicaltrialsare neededbothforcognitiveandmooddisorders. Renal Disease Thebenecialroleofplant-baseddietsintreatingandpotent ially reversing chronic kidney disease is being explored. Kidney disease is particularly common among African-Americans and is mediated through diet and the APOL-1 gene (63-65). The Adventist Health Studies have shown signicant inverse associationsbetweenplant-baseddietarypatternsandrisko ftype 2 diabetes and total mortality among African-Americans ( 66), suggesting the possibility of benet for reducing renal fail ure in thispopulation. Summary In summary, strong, well-designed and -powered interventio n studies using appropriate comparator groups are needed to advance the understanding of plant-predominant eating on the prevention and treatment of a wide array of diseases. High priority populations include children ( 41) and understudied, underserved, and disadvantaged populations with highest incidenceofmultiplediet-impacteddisease.Emphasisshould be placedonhumanratherthananimalstudies. Studiesshouldalsofocusonourcurrentunderstandingofdi et quality (52,67) considering the quality of fats, carbohydrates, and protein not merely their relative proportions.

Physical Activity Overview and Prioritized Research Physical activity is recognized as a key behavior related to the prevention and treatment of many chronic diseases and other health-related conditions.

These studies showed that individuals with more occupationa l physicalactivityhadlowerriskofmortalityandsomemorbid ities than those individuals in more sedentary occupations. These observations provide a foundation of scientic study to suppor t the importance of physical activity as a key lifestyle behavio r to promotehealthandwell-being. There have been key publications and reports over the past few decades that summarize the evolving list of health bene ts of physical activity along with key contemporary consideratio ns for the promotion of a physically active lifestyle ( 73-75). For example, the initial Surgeon General's Report and the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines stated that physical activity s hould be accumulated in bouts of at least 10min to achieve an averag e of30minperdayofmoderate-to-vigorousphysicalactivity( 73- 75).Inadditiontocommonrecommendationsfortheamountof Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 7 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 585744Vodovotz et al. Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit Recommendations physicalactivitythatmaybeneededtoimprovehealth,guidan ce on how to achieve this amount has evolved over time. The 2018PhysicalActivityGuidelinesAdvisoryCommitteesugg ested that all moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, regardles s of the length of bout in which it was accumulated, contributed to th e potentialhealthbenets( 75). Anotherimportantareaofstudyinvolvessedentarybehavior , mostly in the form of sitting, and how it contributes to poor health. Research now suggests that sedentary behavior may have negative influences on health that are independent of participation in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Th is has resultedinnewrecommendationsthatpersonsshouldsitless and movemoretoimprovehealth( 75). Molecular, Cellular, and Aging Mechanisms Understanding physical activity-induced eects on molecular , sub-cellular, cellular, tissue, organ systems, and intra- systems (e.g., cardiovascular and central nervous system) can now b e pursued( 76)(Figure1).Thecellularandmolecularmechanisms of physical activity-induced health benets are becoming be tter understood ( 77). Comprehensive models are being created that include both inherent (genetic and epigenetic) and acquired factors (age, disease state, environment, tness, and nutr ition), which together determine individual dierences in how physic al activityimpactshealthanddisease( Figure1). Why we age and the rate at which we age, i.e., chronological age vs. biological age or lifespan vs. healthspan\u2014are determi ned by multiple molecular processes. Exercise stimulates stem ce ll self-renewal in brain, muscle, and other tissues ( 78). Telomere shortening, bioenergetics, mitochondrial function, and a variety ofpleiotropiceectsaectbiologicalagingandthedevelopment of age-related conditions. The exploration of \"exerkines\" a nd epigenetic mechanisms may yield insights into the signaling pathways that connect exercise and cognitive function as wel l as otherobservedimprovements( 79,80)(Figure1). Better understanding of the factors that promote adopting and sustaining health behaviors generally, and regular phys ical activity specically, is needed. Exercise and physical activ ity are more likely to be incorporated into daily living when tied to one's personal life goals, mission, aspiration, and purpose. Health coaching (81) and the use of digital or other trackers, feedback and social support either in person or through virtual groupshavebeenshowntoimproveinitiationandreinforcemen t of activity and healthier behaviors. Long-term healthy hab it improvement and adoption are most likely when incremental small steps are introduced, achieved, and reinforced ( 82). Other important factors to increase successful engagement includ e clinician modeling of desired behaviors and a clinical syst ems approach using multi-disciplinary teams, the \"prescription\" of lifestyle behaviors, and support which elevates the importanc e of their therapeutic use and impact as embodied in \"exercise as medicine\"( 81,83).

Sleep is dened as a recurring,reversible,neuro-behavioralstateofrelative perceptual disengagement from and unresponsiveness to the environment . Sleep optimizes adaptation and function at every level of biological organization: molecular energy function, cellul ar, tissue,circuitorgan,organsystem,systemicphysiologycog nition and aect. Sleep and wakefulness exist within the 24-h rhythms that organize almost every aspect of our physiology. Every cell has a circadian clock that rests on a transcription-translat ion feedback pathway involving nine core clock genes which regulate their own transcription every 24h ( 84). The \"master pacemaker,\" the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus located above optic chiasm, receives light-dark inputs ( 85). Endogenous rhythmicity occurs within cells determining suc h functions as core body temperature and cortisol production which vary over 24-h periods. Performance, which varies during the course of each day and among individuals, can be expressed as \"chronotype\" vizthe preference for evening or morninghours.Sleepcanbemeasuredbyself-report,actigra phy, electrophysiologic sleep studies ( 86), brain imaging, and even in cultured tissue outside the body ( 87). Circadian variation of gene expression is not only important for disease but also for therapeutics of those diseases ( 88). The circadian timing system impacts, is impacted by, and receives feedback regulation fro m Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 8 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 585744Vodovotz et al. Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit Recommendations healthbehaviors,suchasphysicalactivity,sleep,eating,a ndlight- dark cycles ( 89). These clocks in the brain and cells regulate brain and body function that determines physiology, behavio r, andperformance. Behaviors change the timing of the clock, and in turn the clock aects all of the health behaviors that lead to disease. Sleep ultimately optimizes function at every level of organisms.Sleep prov s. The so-called \"glymphatic system,\" a lymphatic system for the brain, helps clear beta-amyloid and other proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid interstitial spaces ( 91,92). Aging reduces glymphatic clearance, which is associated with the accumula tion of beta amyloid protein and other proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease, which is also marked by severe sleep-wa ke andcircadiandysregulation( 71,93).Foodconsumptionpatterns and timing entrain circadian rhythms and metabolism and can be tied to weight gain and obesity ( 94,95). Sleep restriction increases appetite and reduces insulin sensitivity ( 96). Time- restricted feeding may help prevent obesity and promote weigh t loss(77,97-99). Sleephealthischaracterizedbyregularity,eciency,dur ation, timing, alertness, and satisfaction. Regular sleep of suci ent duration, eciency, timing, and quality is related to healt h and disease. Sleep disorders, such as insomnia, sleep-relat ed movement conditions, parasomnias, and central nervous system-mediated and breathing-related abnormalities, su ch as obstructive sleep apnea have been shown to be associated with health risks. Obstructive sleep apnea has been most notably associated with cardiovascular risk (hypertension, corona ry artery disease, stroke, and atrial brillation), cardiome tabolic risk and risk (sleepiness, inattention, impaired cognition, and depressio n). 101),andotherstudies suggestthatsleepdurationisinverselycorrelatedwithad olescent suicidalbehaviors( 102). Circadian rhythms and sleep patterns (amount, regularity, timing) should be proactively leveraged and promoted to improve health and mitigate diseases which can be exacerbate d by sleep disturbances and the metabolic changes they produce. Use of a broader socio-ecological model which incorporates environmental changes, policies and practices to improve recognition of circadian rhythm, essential natur e of sleep, and health ( 103-105) is important and likely to be clinicallyimpactful.

Stress Overview and Prioritized Research The acute stress response is adaptive and helps activate the cascade of biological and physiological responses to actual o r perceived threats. This response is triggered autonomically to help remove people from danger and enhance survival. With prolonged or extreme stress, brain and body responses canTABLE 3 | Sleep research priorities.

Depression is a multi-determined disease with rates of the disorder and related disability and costs on the rise worldwi de. Biological (e.g., genetic, biochemical, hormonal, inflamm atory) and environmental (e.g., psychosocial adversity) have been implicated as predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors ( 109). Depressive disorders have shown increased prevalence and in turn increased the incidence of many chroni c physical diseases including asthma, arthritis, autoimmune diseases, cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, neuro logical disorders, and obesity ( 110-112).

Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit Recommendations depression and many of these conditions, serve as targets for stressreductionstrategieswithantidepressanteects. One's ability to reset the stress response to a homeostatic resting state is called allostasis and the toll of maintaining this adaptive capacity over a lifetime is the allostatic load (113). Resilience is the degree to which people can cultivate adaptive responses by reducing negative eects of stress and returning to a state of healthy well-being ( 114,115). One of the most powerful mechanisms to reduce stress and enhance resilience is by eliciting a relaxation response ( 116). Mind-body therapies (MBT,suchasmindfulnessmeditation,breathingexercises, yoga, etc.)andcognitivebehavioraltherapy(CBT)canelicitrela xation and improve negative brain-body eects of chronic stress while maintaining reactivity to acute stress ( 117). Mindfulness training fosters attention and acceptance toward one's prese nt momentexperience.CBTteachesadaptivecopingbyreappraisal of (negative) thinking and changing maladaptive behaviors. Cognitive appraisal can be a powerful mediator of perceived stress (71). With regular practice, these types of MBTs enhance bothreactiveandanticipatoryresilienceandhavebeenasso ciated withimprovedimmunefunctionandreductionsinchronicpain, cardiovascular disease, anxiety and depression ( 118-121). The growing availability of these behavioral interventions by digital technology has greatly increased their accessibility and r each worldwide( 122). Notably, it is important to create better understanding, denition and dissemination of a framework for understandi ng, research, and practice that distinguishes \"stress\" from the \"stress response\" ( 113,123-125). In this regard, there are emerging molecular studies in the MBT eld that tie into the lifestyle medicine research priorities described above ( Figure1). For example, recent epigenetic research ( 126) on the positive role of meditation in rapid, epigenetically driven protein expressi on to reduce IL-6 ( 127) suggest the need to study the link between MBT'sandinflammation( Figure1). ThecurrentCOVID-19pandemichasoccurredinthecontext of stress associated with issues of political, socioeconomi c, and racial divisions that is unusual in both scope and intensity ( 125). Perhaps at no time in recent memory has the ability of individuals, families, and communities to recog nize and proactively address mental, physical, and emotional adverse eects from these \"acute\" catastrophes (COVID-19 illness, mortality, social and economic eects) and \"chroni c\" life-shortening institutional biases (racism, poverty, so cial disparities)beenmoreneeded.

Recent social, economic, and environmental factors have fueled the national rise in substance abuse generally and th e opioid epidemic, specically. Misuse of alcohol and other substances are common in the U.S. with 7% of the population meeting criteria for a substance use disorder (SUD), 19% using illicit substances, 6% misusing prescription medications, and 6% consuming unhealthy amounts of alcohol ( 126). Despite the prevalence, those with a SUD have traditionally been excluded from the healthcare system and relegated to a disconnected collection of acute care specialty treatment providers, with limited access to either medical care or medications for SUD. The opioid epidemic has revealed the limitations of the disconnected SUD treatment system, as many people with an opioid use disorder (OUD) have died while cycling between hospitals,jails,oremergencymedicalservice(EMS)contact sand without access to evidence-based treatment, including lif esaving medications( 129). Integrating people with an OUD as well as other SUDs into the healthcare system is the solution to reducing morta lity and morbidity associated with this population. Individuals with an OUD are like other patients with chronic health disorders; they need ongoing care within a primary care patient-centered medical home (PCMH) as well as easy access to the array of specialty treatments and services to address the sequelae of infections, organ damage, and socioeconomic loss that result from their chronic illness.

Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit Recommendations rapid application of agonist medications, including methadon e and buprenorphine, could reduce the OUD mortality rate by 50%, which translates to over 25,000 lives saved each year(129).

Innovations in primary care, such as value-based payments for improved outcomes, expansion of telemedicine technology ( 137), embedding recovery coaches in PCPs (138), and measurement-based care ( 139) have all been found to improve long-term outcomes for people with an OUD (stage4).

Summary Substance abuse and addiction research priorities appear in Table5. Positive Psychology and Social Connectivity Overview and Prioritized Research Positive psychology interventions have been shown to improve subjective well-being, which is associated with improved he alth behaviors, health outcomes, and longevity. The upward spiral theory of lifestyle change suggests positive emotion promote s healthy lifestyle choices ( 141). A meta-analysis of a spectrum of positive psychology interventions, such as the practice of gratitude, forgiveness, and savoring shows a small, but statistically signicant, impact on psychological and subje ctive well-being,whichcan,inturn,beassociatedwithphysicalh ealth benets (142). Other studies have shown an association between having a sense of life purpose and meaning and higher use of preventiveservices,aswellaslowerCVDmortalityinthosew ho alreadyhavethedisease( 143)(Figure1). Of the positive psychology pillars (positive emotion, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment), social connectivity has the most powerful health benets in l ong term cohort studies. These include the ongoing, eight-deca de cohort in the Harvard Study on Adult Development, which has conducted analyses controlling for many confounding varia bles (144,145). Groups with close social ties tend to live longer than those with similar risk conditions but lacking social t ies. Conversely, social isolation (such as living alone, having a small social network, participating in few social activities, feel ing lack of social support and loneliness) is associated with grea ter all-cause mortality, increased morbidity, lower immune sy stem function (likely linked to chronic inflammation), depressio n, and cognitive decline ( 146-148) (Figure1).

SOCIOECOLOGICAL INFLUENCES, ENVIRONMENT, AND EXPOSURES There is a need to move beyond framing individual lifestyle behaviors as only personal \"choices\" toward using an integrat ed model of socioecological influences on health, within which clinical application of lifestyle medicine is a foundational best practicecomponent.Theterm\"lifestylemedicine\"could,ifta ken in isolation, imply that an individual clinical approach could singularlyoradequatelytreatandreversechronicdiseases which are strongly influenced by a variety of socioecological fact ors (151).Manyarebeyondthecontrolofindividualsandaresubject to public policies, economic trends, social inequities, and o ther macrostructuralinfluences. Every patient and family exists within, and is supported (or constrained) by, specic and dierent environments that are increasinglydenedbyculture,location,employment,educa tion, housing, air, water and community. Not surprisingly, then, human health, well-being, performance, and environmental health are closely connected. Built and natural environmen ts (sidewalks, parks) are needed to support safe physical activitie s which become part of regular, easy-to-do routines at home, in schools, at worksites and in neighborhoods ( 152). There is growing evidence that social and environmental inequiti es experienced by some racial and ethnic groups and underserved populations contribute to increased rates of a variety of diseas es (153). Inequities in the social determinants of health (many operatingacrossgenerations),contributetohealthbehavio rsand outcomesacrosspopulationgroupsandgeographies.Wesuggest that the imperative to address not only the social but also the ethical determinants of health should underlie all initiat ives to improvehealth,increaseaccesstomedicalcare,andcreateb etter outcomes( 154). Environmental conditions, both indoor and outdoor, have been linked to objective measures of the stress and relaxati on response, such as heart rate variability and cortisol levels. In striking recent studies, environmental conditions have been associated with epigenetic changes in children living i n disadvantaged neighborhoods ( 155,156). As most Americans currently spend over 90% of their time indoors, the critical r ole of building design and environmental conditions on cognitiv e function, sleep, stress and productivity is increasingly bei ng realized ( 157,158). This role has become especially apparent during the recent period of enforced, long-term lockdowns due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Growing scientic and medical evidence of the health impact of environmental chemicals builds on the troubling legacy o f dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and diethylstilbe strol (DES). Research over the past two decades has consistently identied that minute levels of a broad suite of synthetic chemicals can disrupt endocrine pathways and thereby contribute to disease and disability, including at low leve ls of exposureinsusceptiblewindowsofvulnerability.The accumulating evidence is strongest for four categories of chemicals: flame retardants used in furniture and electron ics; pesticidesusedinagriculture;phthalatesusedinfoodpackagi ng, cosmetics, and personal care products; and bisphenols used in aluminum can linings and thermal paper receipts ( 165).

Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit Recommendations UNDERSERVED AND UNDERSTUDIED POPULATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES Women, children, and marginalized populations have been excluded from much research. Most common chronic diseases occur later in life and thus research has largely focused on older adults. However, the foundations of lifestyle behavi ors are set early in life providing an opportunity to create an integrated approach to the full continuum of women's and children's health. A lifecourse approach can encompass pre- conception, pregnancy, infancy, childhood, and adolescence in ways that will influence health later in life. Preparation for pregnancy and pregnancy itself ( 167) represent the ideal \"teachable moment\" for assisting women and families to understand the foundation of healthy living and to develop a nd adopt life skills to promote optimal growth and development which can span multiple generations. Pre-conception health \"primes\" not only maternal health (e.g., avoiding excessive weight gain and pregnancy complications) but also aects embryonic development and growth that are key drivers for the development of congenital malformations and intrauteri ne growth restriction. During pregnancy and the perinatal period, inadequate plant-based nutrition, lack of folic acid supplementation, stress, environmental toxins, smoking, alcohol,andendocrinedisrupterscanadverselyaectpregnan cy outcomes and subsequent children's disorders. Alteration s to the epigenome and germ cells mediate these health and transgenerational eects ( 168) (Figure1). Maternal exposure to environmental chemicals and their transmission in breas t milk to the infant are beginning to be studied ( 169). Plant-based nutrition, providing a diet rich in micronutrients, as well a s regular physical activity are now seen as essential for produc ing healthypregnanciesandbabies. \"Toxic stress\" in early childhood from psychological trauma , physical abuse or adverse child experiences is now known to aect neurological development at the molecular level and increase the risk for future medical and psychological chronic disease ( 170,171). Poor childhood lifestyle behaviors often become manifest in preventable conditions involving multiple organ systems. These behaviors drive overuse of the medical system and numerous specialty consultations when root causes are either overlooked or unaddressed. Lifestyl e change is more likely to occur and be impactful during younger childhood when family dynamics can be leveraged, as opposed to during adolescence, which is often characterized b y rebellion. Methodological challenges to conducting pediatr ic obesity studies have been described ( 172). Additionally, treatment of children with serious medical conditions must concurrently address psychosocial and lifestyle-related n eeds and behaviors of the patient and their family as their traumat ic experiences can negatively aect medical compliance and long-termoutcomes. Racial, ethnic, and cultural groups have specic strengths, challenges, and beliefs that should be recognized, leverag ed, and addressed. Foundational to a whole person- and family- centric approach is acknowledgment of the chronic stress and physiological eects which accompany the sense of discriminationandbias.We need to better understand and leverage the sociocultural aspects of purpose, spirituality and religion which are powerful forces aligned with healthy behaviors and have not been well- studied. Many religions, for example, in addition to providing stress relief, emotional and spiritual comfort, have emphasi zed healthy living through eating plants rather than animals. However, the study of how to leverage these specic values and messages in the context of religious and spiritual belief sys tems andculturesislacking. Optimizing the economic value of health and productivity (173,174)\u2014particularly among large, self-insured employers\u2014 represents an important route to demonstrate the \"business case\"forlifestylemedicine.Extendingbeyondclinicaland health outcomes to include safety, absenteeism and productivity, th e Total Worker Health framework created and promoted by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH ) (175) represents research opportunities to assess the impact of chronic disease treatment and reversal through clinical prac tice, particularly through the use of on-site clinics and lifestyle medicine ( 176). The occupational productivity impact of sleep quality and insomnia was recently reviewed and summarized (177).Arecentnationalhealthandeconomicanalysisoflimitin g BPA in foods demonstrated a signicant reduction in childho od obesity, heart disease, and cost savings ( 174).

Current methods for assessing strength of evidence (SOE) prioritize the contributions of randomized, placebo-controlledtrials(RCTs).However,RCT'smaynotalw ays besuitabletostudylifestyleinterventionsforimprovedlo ngevity, vitality, or successful aging. Assessment of evidence rele vant to lifestyle medicine requires adaptation of SOE approaches when outcomes and/or exposures obviate exclusive or preferential reliance on RCT designs. SOE tools, such as the Hierarchies of Evidence Applied to Lifestyle Medicine ( 21) are needed to accelerate and prioritize impactful lifestyle-based clini cal researchandpracticedeployment. MOVING FORWARD: FOCUSING AND ACCELERATING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR RESEARCH TO TREAT ROOT CAUSES OF CHRONIC DISEASE In the coming years, federal biomedical funding priorities via the NIH are likely to be targeted to precision medicine, Frontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 14 December 2020 | Volume 7 | Article 585744Vodovotz et al. Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit Recommendations genome editing, the brain, and cancer immunotherapy (with foundational emphasis on immunology and inflammation). The recentlyannounced2020-2030StrategicPlanforNIHNutrit ion Research ( 179) highlights the systems approach to addressing molecular, behavioral, and societal factors in the preventi on and managementofdiet-relateddiseases. Non-federal research-supporting organizations, such as the American Heart Association (AHA) will also have a signican t role in supporting new knowledge generation around lifestyle and chronic disease prevention, treatment, and reversal. Th e AHA's \"Life's Simple 7\": not smoking, healthy eating, physica l activity, healthy weight, blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood glucose are already emphasized ( 180). Adding healthy sleep would create a \"Life's Essential 8.\" The AHA's promotion of Bi g Data and Precision Medicine as well as accelerating progress and breakthroughs through using interdisciplinary consort ia (e.g., the Strategic Focus Research Networks) to focus on specicconditions,issuesandpopulationscanbere-visitedg iven progressinbasic,clinicalandpopulationsciences. The U.S. military has focused on eight interrelated components in the DoD Total Force Fitness framework (181),whichmirrorslifestylemedicinedomainsandinformsthe Department's research priorities. The U.S. Special Operations CommandPreservationoftheForceandFamilyprogram,oneof therstlifestylemedicine-focusedinitiativesinDoDemph asizes service and family member health, well-being and performanc e (182). Importantly, the military understands that care providers must be embedded in military units which may include physical therapists, occupational therapists, and potentially also hum an performancecoaches.TheU.S.VeteransHealthAdministratio n, also prioritizes the broad spectrum of well-being by includin g a focusonspiritandsoulincaringforveterans,asencompassed in the Whole Health aspirational framework ( 183). This approach has had a favorable impact not only on patients but also on doctors,whoreportamuchlowersenseofburnout. The COVID-19 pandemic has exhibited increased severity and mortality among those who are socioeconomicallydisadvantaged, including African-American, Hispanic/Lat ino, Native Americans, and those with multiple co-morbidities (184,185).Theincreasedriskforbothtransmissionandseverity once infected is multifactorial including the inability to shelter at home, need to work in service jobs with heightened exposure to the virus, and living with socioeconomic disadvantages o ften caused by a history of systemic marginalization and exclusio n. Living or working in overcrowded conditions without access to COVIDtestingorhealthcarealsoarefactors.Higherprevalen ce of chronic diseases further increases immune susceptibilit y and inflammation leading to greater COVID-19 morbidity and mortality ( 186). The need to accelerate eorts to promote health and to prevent, treat and reverse chronic diseases must be grounded in a commitment to greater equity for marginalized populations and reduction of exclusionary policie s that block access to healthy behaviors. Leveraging emergin g science, new application of research methods and technologie s, and more appropriate evidence-grading systems to inform clinical care to deploy eective lifestyle medicine practices must become a signicant emerging strategy to improve the lifespan andhealthspan. Finally, we believe that this Summit, its interdisciplinary framework, and recommendations are groundbreaking not onl y in the context of lifestyle medicine, but also potentially for applicationtoothereldsofmedicineaswell.
