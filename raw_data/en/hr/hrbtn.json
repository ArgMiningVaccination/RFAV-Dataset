It's easy to forget that chronic disorders like diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, also known as the \"trifactor-silent killers,\" require long-term treatment rather than being treated as an acute condition. It's crucial to remember that these diseases have the potential to cause major health problems. It usually starts with diabetes in the majority of cases. Hyperlipidemia is a condition in which sugar in the body converts to fatty deposits that can invade the circulatory system. It then causes inflammation of the walls of blood vessels, which affects the blood pressure. When the blood flow is sluggish, the heart needs to be pumped harder, which can trigger high blood pressure. All the diseases mentioned can lead to the risk of secondary health problems such as inflammation that can narrow, rupture, or block the walls of blood vessels, which can cause blindness, kidney failure, strokes, or coronary artery problems such as acute heart attacks. Therefore, people with these medical conditions must seriously manage their health in order to have a good quality of life. Below, we are going to further discuss the role of integrated medicine in managing these diseases. Diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension must Not be left untreated. When one becomes afflicted with one of the diseases listed, it is necessary to seek medical attention on a regular basis. Do not simply disregard it. Seek medical help and receive a precise diagnosis to determine the severity. For example, in order to receive proper treatment for diabetes, one must first determine the type. To get the proper medicine titration for hyperlipemia, one must know the body's cholesterol levels. Long-term medication is usually used to treat hypertension, and maintaining a healthy blood pressure level helps to prevent other health problems. Is medication the real solution More and more people are realizing that relying solely on medication is not the greatest long-term answer. People start to ask if there are any other options and if chemical-based therapies are really necessary. One of the keys, according to integrative medicine, is successful early diagnosis. There are certain cutting-edge health checks on the market that can investigate not just the symptoms but also the fundamental reason. Some tests can even identify potential problems depending on the diagnosis made. Following that, appropriate medical advice and preventive actions can be done, and any future difficulties can be prevented. If, for example, the patient is diagnosed with diabetes, the treating physician can provide appropriate health advice and medication instructions, as well as schedule regular follow-ups to check that the patient is being effectively managed. Integrated medicine a treatment pathway without medication. Many patients do not want to take long-term medication because they believe their blood sugar, cholesterol, or blood pressure levels are not severe. However, failing to seek treatment can put one's health at risk. Physicians consider several key factors when developing integrative medicine pathways, including: - Diagnostic test - Age factor - Lifestyle - Family medical history - Risk of complications Aside from the foregoing, physicians will conduct a thorough consultation session, which will include an in-depth interview, before establishing a treatment pathway and dispensing medication. The majority of the recommendations are for changing lifestyle habits such as avoiding high-fat diets, exercising, getting enough rest, and managing stress. The following are effective integrated treatments that are highly recommended: Nutrient therapy is a type of treatment that employs natural forms of medicaments such as amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, or antioxidants. In addition, lifestyle and dietary changes, as well as proper exercise techniques, will be recommended, and in some cases, patients may not need to take the medication at all. Chelation Therapy aids in the removal of heavy metals and toxin residues from the body. Toxic residues are a cause of pancreatic degeneration and have a direct impact on the circulatory system. Detoxifying heavy metals with Chelation Therapy reduces the risk of blood vessel blockage, improves blood flow, and strengthens the coronary artery system. Ozone Therapy is used to stimulate the dynamics of red blood cells, allowing more oxygen to enter the tissues. This aids in the reduction of blood vessel inflammation. It activates antioxidants, protects cell walls, and aids in blood vessel expansion. Allergostop is a type of vaccination in which the patient's blood is stimulated using a highly scientific clinical procedure that converts antibody or antigen molecules into clear polarity. The prepared vaccine is then reintroduced into the patient's body. This treatment is beneficial in slowing cell degeneration in diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's by preventing cell damage and slowing disease progression. Sedentary lifestyles and poor eating habits pose silent threats that are closer to us than we realize. If health is not properly managed, these causative factors can do a lot of damage to the body. Remember that proper medical care is required to manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. As a result, don't let the ongoing pandemic cause you to overlook your primary health risks. "}
