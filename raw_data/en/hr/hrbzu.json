A variety of factors can compromise the balance of the body. Some examples could include environmental toxins disrupting the system, poor nutrition, or even spiritual and emotional imbalances. Naturopathic doctors believe once the body is brought back to balance it is able to heal itself. There are currently four accredited naturopathic medical schools in the United States. Naturopathic doctors will attend one of these schools. In addition to the basic science classes that conventional medical schools have, naturopathic medical students also attend classes in nutrition, homeopathy, hydrotherapy, botanical medicine, physical medicine, and other complementary modalities. Naturopathic physicians have 6 basic principles: 1. Healing Power of Nature (Vis Medicatrix Naturae): This is the fundamental belief of naturopathic medicine. The naturopathic doctor should serve to guide the body back to balance and encourage the body's ability to heal itself. 2. Doctor as Teacher (Docere): The word doctor is derived from the latin word docere which means \"to teach.\" Naturopathic doctors believe that everyone should be responsible for their own health. Naturopathic doctors teach their patients about how certain treatments, lifestyle choices, and disease processes can effect one's health in order for help the person take over their own health. 3. Prevent disease before it occur: Naturopathic doctors emphasize the importance of preventing diseases before they occur rather than waiting to get a disease and then treat it. 4. Heal the Whole Person (Physical, Mental, Spiritual): Naturopathic doctors believe that every aspect of the person's being is important to that person's health whether it be mind, body, or spirit. 5. Identify and Treat the Cause of Disease: Naturopathic doctors believe it is important to find the root cause of the disease to truly eradicate the disease rather than simply treating the symptoms of the disease. 6. First Do No Harm: Naturopathic doctor use a \"therapeutic order\" as an approach to treating a person in order to use the least harmful/invasive forms of treatment to start with and using more invasive techniques only if necessary.
