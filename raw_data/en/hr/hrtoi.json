Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 1: Food - Drug Interphase (FDI) Products Page 1 of 9 APPENDIX 1 FOOD - DRUG INTERPHASE (FDI) PRODUCTS This guide serves to assist in determining if a product is regulated by the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) or by the Food Safety and Quality Division (FSQD) of the Ministry of Health Malaysia. 1. INTRODUCTION Malaysians are now more health conscious and there is generally greater awareness of the importance of nutrition to overall well -being. In recent years, many consumers also rely on a variety of \"dietary supplements\" to improve their health. These diverse p roducts are freely available through a myriad of outlets. A variety of products are available in the market, supposedly for the maintenance, prevention and even treatment of chronic diseases. These products may range from foods modified to have special pro perties or pure forms of vitamins and minerals to extracts of various botanical or animal products. It is important to monitor and regulate the marketing and sale of these products to protect the interest and health of the consumer. Some of these product s are not clearly defined as \"food\" or \"drugs\" but are freely marketed. Such products include a variety of so -called health products and have been termed as \"food -drug interphase (FDI) products\". In order to better define and regulate the FDI products, bo th the NPRA and the FSQD, Ministry of Health Malaysia formed the Committee for the Classification of Food -Drug Interphase Products in 2000. The main Terms of Reference of the Committee is to assist both Divisions in classifying, in a consistent manner, any application from the industry not clearly defined either as a food or drug product. The Committee also serves as a platform in strengthening and updating the relevant regulations as well as to provide scientific input on these products. 2. FOOD PRODUCTS REGULATED BY FSQD INCLUDE: 2.1 100% food ingredients 2.2 Food products with or without active ingredients (e.g.: herbs, vitamins, minerals, etc.) such as: i) Instant drink products containing sugar and creamer (e.g. premix coffee, tea, chocolate, soy, cereal) Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 1: Food - Drug Interphase (FDI) Products Page 2 of 9 ii) Meat essence products (liquid) (e.g. chicken essence, ostrich essence, duck essence, fish essence, etc.) iii) Ready to drink products (beverages) without dosing instruction in cheer packs/ cans / packet drinks. iv) Cordial products with recomme nded dilution ratio (e.g. dates cordial, grape cordial) v) Vinegar products (powder & liquid) (e.g. apple vinegar, dates vinegar, etc.) vi) Honey products (powder & liquid) 2.3 Isotonic drink products, sport nutrition products and special purpose food prod ucts 2.4 Products in conventional food form, e.g. biscuit, cake, confectionery, candy/sweet, gummy, noodle 2.5 Products used for cooking and food preparation (e.g. cooking oil (olive oil, coconut oil, sunflower oil ), herbs and spices) 2.6 Herbs and spices in crude form without medicinal/ health claim 3. PRODUCTS REGULATED BY NPRA INCLUDE: 3.1 Products containing active ingredient(s) with or without excipient 3.2 Products containing specific active ingredients, which possess high pharmacological or therapeutic potencies. Examples of the ingredients are paracetamol, glucosamine, tranexamic acid, aspirin, and substances listed in Poisons Act 1952 3.3 Products containing specific active ingredients, which possess dose -related therapeutic potencies such as: Plant sterols/ stanols and esters that are consumed 3.5g/day Psyllium husk that are consumed 3.5g/day Products containing senna 0.5g 3.4 Products in pharmaceutical dosage form, such as soft gel, capsule or tablet (that is to be directly swa llowed), sublingual, buccal, spray into the mouth, etc. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 1: Food - Drug Interphase (FDI) Products Page 3 of 9 4. FDI PRODUCTS Generally, FDI products are products with combination of food ingredients and active ingredients for oral consumption. FDI products are not clearly defined as food or drug. Examples of food ingredients are fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, milk, cocoa and cereal. Examples of active ingredients are vitamins, minerals, herbs, enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics, amino acids, pe ptides, coral calcium, fatty acids, collagen, chia seed, astaxanthin, lutein and other ingredients that are not traditionally consumed as food . FDI products may be presented in the form of powder, liquid, semisolid forms such as gel/ jelly, chewable tablet, drops, granule, etc. 4.1 Classification of FDI Products FDI is not a product category and it is important to determine whether the products are regulated as drug (under the NPRA's purview), or as food (under the FSQD's purview) because different regulatory requirements apply. The classification of FDI products are based on criteria, as out lined below: a) Main criteria i. Negative List for FDI as listed in Table I: Negative List For FDI : FDI products containing ingredient(s) from Negative List for FDI shall be regulated by NPRA; or ii. Medicinal/ health claim refer to the term \"medicinal purpose\" as stipulated in the Sales of Drug Act 1952, Section 2: FDI products not containing ingredient(s) from Negative List for FDI and with medicinal/ health claim shall be regulated by NPRA ; or FDI products not containing ingredient(s) from Negative List for FDI and without medicinal/ health claim shall be regulated by FSQD . iii. Products intended to be used or capable, or purported or claimed to be capable for a medicinal purpose (e.g. products used for the health benefit of eyes, body weight control, gastrointestine, brain, etc.) shall be regulated by NPRA. b) Other criteria When there is greater uncertainty regarding the safety of a FDI product, such product shall be regulated by NPRA. This is to enable closer monit oring of such product to safeguard the health of the consumer.

GENERAL INFORMATION 1.1 DEFINITIONS i) Biopharmaceutical/ Biotechnology Product ii) Biologic/ Biological Product The term 'biopharmaceutical' was coined in the 80's to define proteins that were made by recombinant DNA technology [which includes hybridoma technology for monoclonal antibody (mAb) production]. Biologic/ Biological product refers to a product whose active substance is made by or derived from a living organism (plant, human, animal or microorganism) and may be produced by biotechnology methods and other cutting -edge technologies. This product imitates natural biological substances in our bodies such as hormones, enzymes or antibodies. Biological substance is defined as a substance that is produced by or extracted from a biological source and that needs, for its characterization and the determination of its quality , a combination of physicochemical -biological testing together with the pr oduction process and its controls. Biopharmaceuticals/ Biologics/ Biological products can also be defined as: \"A protein (including antibodies) or nucleic acid -based pharmaceuticals used for therapeutic, which is produced by means other than direct extrac tion from a native (non -engineered) biological source\". This corresponds to the new biotechnology view (that is, by elimination, it is largely restricted to recombinant/ genetically engineered and mAb -based products). The term 'Biotechnology product' and 'Biological product' are used to broadly refer to all biopharmaceuticals (by the broad biotechnology view). Note: Today, biologics have become inextricably intertwined with biopharmaceuticals, to the point where they are synonymous. The general consensus is that a 'Biologic' and 'Biopharmaceutical' are interchangeable terminology, but a biologic might incorporate som e other products (e.g. allergenics, somatic cells etc.). Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 4: Guideline on Registration of Biologics Page 4 of 21 Biologics include a wide range of products such as: 1. Vaccines; 2. Blood products; 3. Monoclonal antibodies (therapeutics); 4. Recombinant proteins: - Insulins - Hormones - Erythropoetins and other hematopoietic factors - Cytokines: interferons, interleukins, colony -stimulating factors, tumour necrosis factors 5. Cell and Gene Therapy Products (CGTPs) But do not include : 1. Metabolites from microorganisms; e.g . antibiotics and some hormones. 2. Macromolecules produced by chemical synthesis; e.g . peptides/ oligonucleotides produced by chemical synthesis. 3. Whole blood or cellular blood components. Unlike small -molecule generic drugs, exact copies of biologics are impossible to produce because these are large and highly complex molecules produced in living cells. A 'biosimilar' medicinal product (a short designation for 'similar biological medicinal product') is considered as a new biological medicinal product developed to be similar in terms of qua lity, safety and efficacy to an already registered, well established, medicinal product. For details, please refer to Guidance Document and Guideline s for Registration of Biosimilars in Malaysia . Cell and Gene Therapy Products (CGTPs) are regulated as Biologic products. Unlike biotechnology products which are mostly purified proteins of cells, CGTPs contain living and functiona l cells. Therefore, CGTP is regulated under a separate framework. For details, please refer to Guidance Document and Guidelines for Registration of Cell and Gene Therapy (CGTPs) in Malaysia . This document provides information for manufacturers, applicants, healthcare professionals and the public on legal arrangements in Malaysia for the registration of CGTPs. The implementation of the guideline will be compulsory on 1 January 2021 as stated i n Directive No. 6, 2017. Please also refer to Directive No. 19, 2020 regarding the details of mechanism for registration and enforcement of CGTPs in stages.

Nevertheless, because of their nature, biologicals demand special attention with regard to their regulations to assure quality, efficacy and safety. Biologicals are inherently variable due to their biological nature, produced from biological materials, and often tested in biological test systems, themselves variable, a feature that has important consequences for the safety and efficacy of the resulting product. Ea ch product must be evaluated on its own merits. A prerequisite for the use of biological is therefore to assure the consistency of quality and safety from lot -to-lot. Today, the biological field is one of enormous expansion and increasing diversity, mos t especially in the area of new biotechnologies. The revolution of DNA -based and other cell technologies has opened up a new and exciting vista, and in many instances, traditional products are being replaced by equivalents derived by recombinant DNA techn ologies or other cutting -edge technologies. It is important to note that the demonstration that a product consistently possesses a desired characteristics of safety and efficacy will depend on a multifaceted approach on the part of manufacturer and the re gulatory authority - drawing on thorough characterization of starting materials, demonstration of consistency of production, and appropriate selection of lot release tests - all under the stringent and documented controls imposed by good manufacturing prac tices - as well as rigorous post marketing surveillance activities.

Plasma -derived therapies and their recombinant analogs are unique among pharmaceuticals and biologics. Their production begins with a biological starting material, human plasma. Each therapy has a unique biochemical profile as a result of differences in production and processing methods that can lead to differing clinical responses and efficacy among patients. Hence, from the starting material, through manufacturing and final distribution to patients, the complexities of producing blood products places it in a unique class of biologics. Blood products are regulated as medicinal product. Blood products are inherently variable d ue to their biological nature, and the biological methods to test them. They are subjected to comprehensive assessment of the quality, efficacy and safety. Four (4) principal complementary approaches are adopted: Starting material: Assurance of the qu ality and safety of the plasma for fractionation. Manufacturing technique: Control of the fractionation and subsequent manufacturing procedures for isolation, purification, viral inactivation and/or removal steps. Good manufacturing practice (GMP): Stric t adherence to GMP. Adoption of GMP as an essential tool of Quality Assurance System. Product Compliance: Standardization of biological methods needed in characterisation of in -process and finished products. Plasma for fractionation and blood products th at are regulated by NPRA includes: Plasma products derived from plasma collected and fractionated in Malaysia for use in Malaysia; Plasma products derived from plasma collected and fractionated overseas for use in Malaysia; and Plasma products derived from overseas -sourced plasma fractionated in Malaysia for use overseas. Note: This document is applicable to all plasma -derived products containing an active and inactive ingredient that is derived from human blood.

Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 7A: Homeopathic Products Page 2 of 14 Glossary for Homeopath ic Products: Active substance: Active substances are considered to be source materials processed by one or a sequence of homeopathic manufacturing procedures listed in pharmacopoeias in official use and other officially recognized documents (e.g. mother t inctures, dilutions or triturations). Diluent: Substance used for the preparation of a stock/ starting material or the potentisation process and which may also represent the substance of the dosage form. Liquid diluents usually consist of purified water, aqueous solution, glycerol or ethanol of a suita ble concentration or for which there is an appropriate monograph. The commonest solid diluent is usually lactose monohydrate. Dilution: Dilution has two meanings in homeopathy: For a product, a dilution is a liquid homeopathic preparation which is potentised as described below (see the definition of potentisation). Individual dilutions are also called potencies; As a procedure, dilution means the de -concentration process of a liquid or a solid preparation. One part of each stage in the preparation o f a homeopathic medicine from its stock or previous dilution (potency) by adding one part of a previous solid or liquid phase to a predetermined weight or volume of the diluent (see Potentisation below). Dilution occurs at all stages of production of the h omeopathic medicines whether by addition of solid excipient in trituration or the addition of diluent in the liquid phase and succussion. Dosage form: a dosage form in homeopathy complies with any relevant specifications for that dosage form for which an appropriate characterization exists in a pharmacopoeia in official use, or in other officially recognized documents. The most commonly encountered homeopathic dosage form, the globule (pillule or pellet) , is a solid spherule which consists of lactose, sucr ose or any other suitable vehicle. Usually, preformed globules are impregnated with a dilution or directly by a mother tincture. The homeopathic dosage form tablet is a solid preparation which complies with any relevant characterization in the pharmacopoei a in official use (or in other officially recognized documents) for tablets. Homeopathic medicines in tablet form are either prepared by impregnation of preformed tablets or by compression of triturations with the vehicle. The most commonly used liquid hom eopathic medicines are either alcoholic solutions or oral liquids. Excipient: Substance needed for manufacturing a dosage form (used after potentisation) such as wheat starch and magnesium stearate for tablets. It may also represent the substance of the dosage form. Homeopath: A qualified provider (practitioner) of homeopathic treatment. Homeopathic medicines: Any medicine prepared in accordance with a homeopathic manufacturing procedure described by a pharmacopoeia in official use or other officially recognized documents. A homeopathic medicine may contain a number of homeopathic preparations. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 7A: Homeopathic Products Page 3 of 14 Homeopathy: Classical homeopathy is a system of medicine using preparations of substances whose effects, when administered to healthy subjects, correspond to the manifestations of the disorder in the individual patients. Mother tincture (also called tincture): The initial homeopathic preparation made from source material that can be further potentised (also called \"liquid stock\"), sometimes used as homeopathic medicines, is regarded as the most concentrated form of a finished homeopathic medicine. Mother tinctures are obtained classically by maceration or percolation (sometimes also by digestion, infusion, decoction or fermentation) techniques from source mater ials according to a procedure prescribed by a recognized homeopathic pharmacopoeia. Sometimes a mother tincture corresponds to the first decimal dilution, \"1D\" or \"1X\" (10 -1), mostly when dry plant material is used as starting material. Nosodes: Homeopat hic medicines prepared from disease products from humans or animals; from pathogenic organisms or their metabolic products; or from decomposition products of animal organs. Potency: The denominated degree of serial trituration or dilution and succession t hat is reached for each homeopathic medicine. The degrees of dilution or potencies are normally indicated by the letters D, DH or X for successive 1 to 10 (decimal) dilutions, the letters C, CH or K or CK for successive 1 to 100 (centesimal) dilutions whil e Q or LM 50 000 (Hahnemannian quinquagintamillesimal) dilutions. Dilution by 1 to 10 denotes 1 part processed with 9 parts of diluent (Hahnemannian decimal), dilution by 1 to 100, 1 part processed with 99 parts (Hahnemannian or Kors akovian centesimal), and so on. The number preceding the letters (e.g. D, C or LM) normally indicates the number of dilution steps employed (Table 1). As a consequence of different views in various approaches in homeotherapy and because the notion of these terms may depend on the nature of the starting materials, the terms \"high potency\" and \"low potency\" cannot be defined unambiguously. Potentisation (also called dinamization) : The combined process of serial dilution and succussion or trituration at each step in the manufacture of homeopathic medicines from stocks. (According to the tenet of homeopathy, potentisation represents the process by which the activity of a homeopathic medicine is developed.) Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 7A: Homeopathic Products Page 4 of 14 Table I: ratio dilution only the Hahnemannian method of manufacture (multi - flask method) is used. bFor 1:100 dilution ratios a C potency is assumed to use the Hahnemannian method of manufacture (multi -flask method) and can also be denoted as CH. When the Korsakovian method of manufacture (single -flask method) is used, the potency is designated as CK or K. Sarcodes: Homeopathic medicines made from healthy animal tissues or secretions. In Greek, sarcode means fleshly. Source material (raw material, starting material, mother substance): Source material is the original raw material used for the production of homeopathic medicines. This material is obtained from natural sources, e.g. of botanical, zoological, microbiological, mineral, chemical, animal and human origin, or synthetic procedures. Source materials may undergo preliminary treatment in order to be further processed. Stock: Substances or preparations made from the source materials (e.g. by maceration, succussion or trituration) used as starting points for the production of homeopathic medicines.

In vitro studies as well as animal studies (in vivo ) are intended to generate the non -clinical data. Data from animal study should be derived from animal model which can represent human condition related to claim. The methodology should be an acceptable and valid procedure to measure the parameter. Data from animal studies are important to give the preliminary efficacy and safety data prior to the conduct of human study. When data from animal (in vivo ) and in vitro studies are submitted as substantiation of claims, an explanation on its relevance to humans should be included. Requirements: 4.3.1 Should present an integrated and critical ass essment of the pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic and toxicologic evaluation. 4.3.2 Relevant scientific literature of related active ingredient (s) of product can be considered as an additional supporting document . 4.3.3 Non -clinical studies must be conducted in OECD GLP compliance facility. 4.3.4 Content and Structural Format: 4.3.4.1 Toxicology written summary 4.3.5.7 Toxicology tabulated summary Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 7B: Guideline on Natural Products with Therapeutic Claim Page 12 of 14 4.4 CLINICAL DOCUMENT (PART IV) Primary purpose: The clinical section addresses the requirements for pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, efficacy and safety studies. Scientific data should be derived from intervention human studies, that are well designed in accordance with recognized scientific principles, with statistically and clinically significant outcomes addressing the specific traditional claim. The acceptable principles for human studies can be ref erred to internationally accepted guidelines, for example, ICH -GCP Guidelines. Requirements: 4.4.1 Should describe and explain the overall approach to the clinical development of a product . 4.4.2 Assess the quality of the design and performance of the studies, and t o include a statement regarding GCP compliance. 4.4.3 Scientific evidence from human studies on end -product . 4.4.4 Content and Structural Format of Clinical Overview: 4.4.4.1 Product Development Rationale 4.4.4.2 Overview of Natural Product Formulations 4.4.4.3 Overview of Clinical Pharmacology 4.4.4.4 Overview of Efficacy/Claim benefits 4.4.4.5 Overview of Safety 4.4.4.6 Benefits and Risks Conclusions 4.4.5 Clinical Written Summaries Format: 4.4.5.1 Product Development Rationale 4.4.5.2 Overview of Natural Product Formulations 4.4.5.3 Overview of Clinical Pharmacology 4.4.5.4 Overview of Efficacy 4.4.5.5 Overview of Safety 4.4.5.6 Benefits and Risks Conclusions 4.4.6 Relevant scientific literature of related active ingredient (s) of product can be considered as an additional supporting document . Any deviation sh ould be discussed and justified. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 7B: Guideline on Natural Products with Therapeutic Claim Page 13 of 14 Examples of scientific evidence : Evidence obtained from at least one properly designed randomized controlled (preferably multi -centre) double blind trial . It is preferable to have data from at least two trials independent of each other, but in some cases, one large well -conducted trial may suffice. Evidence can be obtained from well -designed controlled trials with or without randomization. Systematic reviews of the clinical research relating to particular subject areas Peer reviewed scientific data or meta -analysis (these evidences must be product specific and published in reputable peer reviewed journals) Where there are differences between the ingredient and reported therapeutic benefit, a justification will be required in your evidence package to address the discrepancy. Non -clinical studies, cellular or pharmacological studies, these alone are not considered sufficient evidence to support a scientific indication. However, such studies can be used to provide secondary sup port to human data. Internationally recognised monographs and pharmacopoeias can also provide additional support to specific indications referring to health enhancement claims, but such items will need further evidentiary support from primary research articles and/or systematic reviews. The more specific the indication, the more evidence you need to provide to support your indication. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 7B: Guideline on Natural Products with Therapeutic Claim Page 14 of 14 5.0 GLOSSARY Active ingredient - The therapeutically active component in a medicine's final formulation that is responsible for its physiological action Clinical Trial/ Study - Any investigation in human subjects intended to discover or verify the clinical, pharmacological and/or other pharmacodynamic effects of an investigational product(s) and/or to identify any adverse reactions to an investigational product(s) and/or to study absorp tion, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of an investigational product(s) with the object of ascertaining its safety and/or efficacy. The terms clinical trial and clinical study are synonymous. Efficacy - a relative concept referring to the ability of a medicine or treatment to achieve a beneficial clinical effect. This may be measured or evaluated using objective or subjectiv e parameters. Product - a drug in a dosage unit or otherwise, for use wholly or mainly by being administered to one or more human beings or animals for a medicinal purpose; or a drug to be used as an ingredient of a preparation for a medicinal purpose. Scientific evidence - a quantifia ble data and usually includes reports of clinical trials in humans, human epidemiological studies, animal studies and other cellular or pharmacological studies. Due to the quantifiable nature of scientific evidence, scientific indications can imply clinica l efficacy where the indication is supported by such data. 6.0 REFERENCES 1.

INTRODUCTION 1.1. A significant part of the quality of a finished product is dependent on the quality of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) used for its formulation. Thus, a proper system of qualification of suppliers is necessary to ensure a constant sourcing of AP I of appropriate quality and to safeguard the public health interests. This will be done through standardized quality assessment and inspection procedures. 1.2. The National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) under the purview of the Ministry of Health Ma laysia has introduced mandatory control of API as part of the requirements in the product registration application. 1.3. The implementation began with voluntary submission for New Drug Product in April 2011 and followed by : Phase 1 New Drug Products (January 2012) Phase 2 Scheduled Poison a) New Application (Generic Product ): - i. Parenteral Dosage Form : 1 July 2014 ii. Oral Dosage Form : 1 July 2016 iii. Others : 1 July 2018 b) Registered Product (Pharmaceutical products containing Scheduled Poison): All Dosage Form: Expire on 1 January 2020 onwards *refer to No. 7 of this document . Phase 3 Generic Product NOT containing Scheduled Poison (to be determined) Reference s: i) Bil. (12) dlm. BPFK/PPP/01/03 Jld.1 (17 March 2011 ) ii) BPFK/PPP/07/25 (7) January 2014 ) iii) Bil. (11) dlm. BPFK/PPP/01/03 Jld.3 (27 June 2014 ) 1.4 The procedure for control of API establish ed by the NPRA is based on the following principles: A general understanding of the production and quality control activities of the manufacturer; Assessment of API data and information, including changes and variations, submitted by the product registrati on holder (PRH)/API Manufacturer . These data should include the manufacturing process, material specifications and test data and results; Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 11: Regulatory Control of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) Page 3 of 18 Assessment of the manufacturing site(s) for consistency in production and quality control of raw materials, with specific emphasis on key raw materials and API during and after purification through compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP); Random sampling and testing of API (post -marketing surveillance); Handling of complaints and recalls; and Monitoring of complaints from other agencies and countries. 1.5. This document is intended to provide guidance regarding the requirements to be included for API in the quality part of the product dossier (Part II -S). 2. DEFINITION 2.1 Definition of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) API refers to a ny substance or mixture of substances intended to be used in the manufacture of a pharmaceutical dosage form and that, when used so, becomes an active ingredient of that pharmaceutical dosage form. Such substances are inten ded to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment or prevention of disease or to affect the structure and function of the body (WHO Technical Report Series No. 970, 2012 ). 2.2 Definition of Main API Manufacturer Main API Manufacturer refers to the manufacturer involved in the final API manufacturing process and responsible for batch release . 3. SCOPE 3.1. This guideline encompasses the final API of new products for registration and current/exist ing registered products. This is applicable to all pharmaceutical products (excluding biologic products, traditional products, veterinary products, health supplement products and products for export only (FEO) ) both locally manufactured and imported. 3.2. For b iological active substances , refer to the relevant guidelines available for Biologics. 3.3. Premixing of API is part of the product manufacturing process; therefore, information on premixed API should be submitted under Part II -P. Submission for Part II -S solely includes information on API only. 3.4. Separate registration of the API is not a requirement for the purpose of product registration. However, the required technical documentation pertaining to each API should be submitted with the new product registration application.

Rare disease refers to a life -threatening and/ or chronically debilitating rare condition as listed in the Malaysian Rare Disease List . 1. DESIGNATION OF ORPHAN MEDICINE The designation of orphan medicine is under the purview of Bahagian Regulatori Farmasi Negara (NPRA ) through input from the Drug Evaluation Committee (DEC) . 2. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR DESIGNATION OF ORPHAN MEDICINE The designation of orphan medicine is subject to the following criteria : a) \"A medicine, vaccine or in vivo diagnostic agent that is primarily intended to treat, prevent or diagnose a rare disease \"1; and b) No satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized; or, if suc h a method exists, the medicinal product must be of significant benefit2 to those affected by the condition. 1 Rare disease refers to the diseases listed in the latest Malaysian Rare Disease List. 2 As defined by European Medicines Agency (EMA), significant benefit means that a medicine produces a clinically relevant advantage or makes a major contribution to pati ents' care, compared with existing methods to treat the condition. Thus, orphan designation is given to a product that will improve patients' current treatment, having considered what else is available. Note: This part shall be read in conjunction with other parts of the DRGD that apply to orphan medicines (where applicable), e.g. re -registration procedure, withdrawal of registration, labeling requirements, post -market surveillance, etc. Please also refer to Malaysian Orphan Medicines Guideline , FAQ and documents related to orphan medicines available at www.pharmacy.gov.my Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 13: Designation and Registration of Orphan Medicines Page 2 of 16 3.

BIOEQUIVALENCE (BE) REQUIREMENTS 1.1 Overview In applications for generic medicinal products, the concept of bioequivalence is fundamental. The purpose of establishing bioequivalence is to demonstrate equivalence in biopharmaceutics quality between the generic medicinal product and a comparator medicinal product in order to allow bridging of precl inical tests and of clinical trials associated with the comparator medicinal product. A generic medicinal product is a product which has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in active substances and the same dosage form as the medicinal produc t, and whose bioequivalence with the comparator medicinal product has been demonstrated by appropriate bioavailability studies. The different salts, esters, ethers, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes or derivatives of an active substance are considere d the same active substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy. Applicant s are advised to refer to and be familiar with the latest ASEAN Guideline for The Conduct of Bioequivalence Studies regarding the recommendation for establishing the interchangeability of generic product with comparator product . In addition, other relevant and latest international guidelines , e.g. by EMA, USFDA, ICH should also be referred to complement the ASEAN Guideline. These guideline s are to be re ad in conjunction with pertinent directives, circulars and updates regarding implementation of bioequivalence requirement s in Malaysia, which will be updated periodically on the NPRA website . 1.2. Scope of Implementatio n Bioequivalence (BE) requirement is implemented by stages for generic product application s in Malaysia. Currently, this requirement is applicable to all generic products in the form of oral solid dosage form s with systemic actions . The following Table 1 summarizes t ypes of dosage forms that are required to submit BE data for new application of generic product registration or product registration renewal. The scope of implementation is not exhaustive and will be reviewed accordingly from time to time upon scientific judgement and patient risk assessment by the National Drug Authority. As for now, d osage forms that are not covered within the scope are not required to submit BE data during product registration or product registration renewal . Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 16: Bioequivalence (BE) Requirements Page 2 of 10 Table 1: Implementa tion of BE Requirement Types of dosage form Directive s All generic products containing scheduled poison in the form of modified release , oral, solid PPP/01/03 Jld.3 (12 June 2013) All generic products containing scheduled poison in the form of immediate release , oral, solid dosage form. Directive (2 March 2011) Bioequivalence study report for all registered generic products containing scheduled poison with effervescent, dispersible, orodispersible, sublingual, buccal and chewable dosage Jld.3 (31 May 2016) Should further clarification be needed on the BE requirement s, kindly contact be_sug@npra.gov.my 1.3 Documentation of BE Study Report A complete BE report with all the appendi ces and comparative dissolution profile data/ report according to the relevant guidelines shall be submitted during generic product registration application. The complete BE report should consist of BE study protocol, clinical study report, method validation report, bioanalytical report and pharmacokinetic & statistical report. Applicant s are advised to refer to the Bioequivalence Study Report Submission Checklist in preparation of dossier for submission . The complete document ation should be submitted in QUEST 3+ system under section P9 Product Interchangeability/ Equivalence Evidence . Hardcopy of the report shall be requested when deemed necessary. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 16: Bioequivalence (BE) Requirements Page 3 of 10 1.4 Bioequivalence (BE) Study Centre Accreditation As of 1 January 2012, all BE studies intended to be used to support product registration review by the NPRA must be conducted at clinical and bioanalytical facilities that are listed under the NPRA BE Centre Compliance Programme. The list of accredited fac ilities is available on the NPRA website . For BE studies that were conducted outside the period of facility listing on the NPRA BE Centre Compliance Programme; or were conducted at facilities not listed on the Programme, the applicant may apply for the \" Evaluation on the Need for BE Study Inspection \" to the Centre of Compliance & Quality Control (PKKK). Successful applications would allow the BE studie s to be accepted for product registration review. If the application s were not successful, a study specific inspection would be required. The application form, additional details and procedure on how to apply for the \"Evaluation on the Need for BE Study In spection\" and study specific inspections can be obtained from the NPRA website . Applicable directive s and circulars regarding the as (23 Edition) Direktif Pelaksanaan 1/9/13 (3) (21 July 2020) 2. Investigational Products 2.1 Test Product The test product used in the BE study should be manufactured at the same drug product manufacturing site by the same manufacturing process and manufactured with the same drug substance and formula as the generic product propose d for registration in Malaysia . The batch size of test product used in the BE study should also be at least 100,000 units or 1/10 of production scale, whichever is greater , unless otherwise justified . Any deviation from this requirement should be justified with additional documentation to ensure the sam eness of both test product and product proposed for registration . Applicant s are advised to refer to FAQ on the NPRA website for the additional documentation required . Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 16: Bioequivalence (BE) Requirements Page 4 of 10 2.2 Reference Product The reference product used in the BE study must be the same as the innovator / comparator product s which ha ve been registered with Drug Control Authority (DCA) in Malaysia. A generic product for which its innovator has never been registered in Malaysia will be classified under Hybrid application. For purpose of product registration in Malaysia, a pplicants are advised to use Malaysia comparator product (MCP) to conduct the BE studies. The list of Malaysia comparator product is available on the NPRA website. Applicant should provide a copy of the outer carton label which clearly showing batch number, manufacturer address , expiry date and the prescribing information (product leaflet) of the reference product used in the BE study for verification purposes. Should the reference product use in the BE study was manufactured at a different site from the MCP, or manufacturer address was not stated on the outer carton, the applicant should justify and prove that the BE reference product is identical with th e MCP in the following aspects: - (i) The ingredients in the BE reference pro duct are qualitatively identical to t he Malaysia comparator product except minor differences in excipient (e.g. colouring and ink) that will not affect bioavailability of the reference product. (ii) Comparative dissolution profile of the BE reference product is similar with the Malaysia comparator product. The CDP should be conducted as per requirement in Appendix I of ASEAN Guideline for the Conduct of Bioequivalence Study. It is highly recommended to conduct the CDP between refere nce product and MCP simultaneously to reduce potential variabilities and avoid comparison and compilation of historical data. (iii) The drug substance does not have a narrow therapeutic index Should the MCP be no longer available or could not be found on the list of comparators , kindly contact be_sug@npra.gov.my for further assistance. 3. Study Design 3.1 Immediate Release Product For products where the Summary of Product Characteristic ( SmPC ) recommends intake of the comparator medicinal product on an empty stomach or irrespective of food intake, the BE study should be conducted under fasting conditions. BE study should be conducted under fasting conditions as this is considered to be the most sensitive condition to detect a potential difference between formulations. For products where the SmPC recommends intake of the comparator medicinal product only in fed state, the BE study should generally be conducted under fed conditions. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 16: Bioequivalence (BE) Requirements Page 5 of 10 3.2 Modified Release Product Single dose BE studies under both fasting and fed conditions should be submitted. Multiple dose study in fasting or fed state will be requested when deemed necessary . 4. Dissolution Testing and Similarity of Dissolution Profile 4.1 General Aspects of Dissolution Testing as Related to Bioavailability During the development of a medicinal product, a dissolution test is used as a tool to identify formulation factors that are influencing and may have a crucial effect on the bioavailability of the drug. As soon as the composition and the manufacturing process are defined, a dissolution test is used in the quality control of scale -up and of production batches to ensure both batch -to- batch consistency and that the dissolution profiles remain similar to those of pivotal clinical trial batches. Furthermore, in certain instances a dissolution test can be us ed to waive a BE study. Therefore, dissolution studies can serve several purposes: (i) Testing on product quality To get information on the test batches used in bioequivalence studies and pivotal clinical studies to support specifications for quality con trol To be used as a tool in quality control to demonstrate consistency in manufacture To get information on the reference product used in bioavailability/bioequivalence studie s and pivotal clinical studies (ii) Bioequivalence surrogate inference To demonstrate in certain cases similarity between different formulations of an active substance and the reference medicinal product (biowaivers e.g., variations, formulation changes during development and generic medicinal products ) To investigate batch -to-batch consistency of the products (test and reference) to be used as basis for the selection of appropriate batches for the in-vivo study 4.2 Comparative Dissolution Profile (CDP) In order to compare the dissolution profile of the products, the dissolution data should be generated under the same test conditions, if possible, on the same day. It is highly recommended to conduct the dissolution test ing concurrently to reduce potential variabilities and avoid comparison and compilation of historical data Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 16: Bioequivalence (BE) Requirements Page 6 of 10 4.2.1 Usual Testing Condition s (i) Media buffer The in vitro dissolution test should be conducted at three different buffers (normally pH1.2, 4.5, 6.8) and the med ia intended for product release (QC media, if applicable and available). Surfactants should be avoided in comparative dissolution testing. A statement that the API is not soluble in any of the media is not sufficient, and profiles in the absence of surfactant should be provided. The rationale for the choice and concentration of surfactant should be provided. The concentration of the surfactant should be such that the discriminatory power of the test will not be compromised. (ii) Number of products to be tested At least 12-unit of each investigative products should be used in CDP test ing to enable statistical evaluation. The products should originate from batch of at least 1/10 of production scale or 100,000 units, whichever is greater, unless otherwise justified . (iii) Agitation Selection of speed of agitation should be properly justified. Stirrer used in paddle apparatus is usually at 50rpm for tablets and basket apparatus at 100rpm for capsules. (iv) Sampling time points Sampling time points should be sufficient to obtain meaningful dissolution profiles, and at least every 15 minutes. More frequent sampling during the period of greatest change in the dissolution profile is recommended. For rapidly dissolving products, where complete dissolution is within 30 minutes, generation of an adequate profile by sampling at 5 - or 10 - minute intervals may be necessary . (v) Statistical comparison Dissolution similarity may be det ermined using suitable statistical procedure e.g the f2 similarity factor as described in ASEAN guideline or other international guidelines. (vi) Documentation Complete documentation of in vitro dissolution experiments is required including a study protocol, batch information on batches, detailed experimental conditions, validation of experimental methods, individual and mean results and respective summary statistics. 5. Biow aiver consideration s Generic products should demonstrate the bioequivalence evidence by in -vivo equivalence testing. Nevertheless, exemption on the submission of an in-vivo BE study can be considered in certain circumstances for generic products of oral solid dosage form s. Applicant s should provide adequate data and justifications for not submitting the in-vivo data. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 16: Bioequivalence (BE) Requirements Page 7 of 10 5.1 Waiver of Additional Strength (s) In generic drug product application consist s of several strengths , it may be sufficient to establish bioequivalence at only one or two strengths, depending on the proportionality in composition between the different strengths and BE test produc ts. If bioequivalence has been demonstrated at the strength(s) that are most sensitive to detect a potential difference between products, in -vivo BE studies for the other strength s may be waived provided that the following requirement s are fulfilled : - (a) the different strengths of the generic product are manufactured by the same manufacturing process, (b) the qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same, (c) the composition of the strengths are quantitatively proportional, i.e. th e ratio between the amount of each excipient to the amount of active substance(s) is the same for all strengths (for immediate release products coating components, capsule shell, colour agents and flavours are not required to follow this rule) If there is some deviation from quantitatively proportional composition, condition (c) is still considered fulfilled if condition (i) and (ii) or (i) and (iii) below apply to the strength used in the bioequivalence study and the strength(s) for which a wai ver is considered (i) the amount of the active substance(s) is less than 5 % of the tablet core weight or the weight of the capsule content ; (ii) the amounts of the different core excipients or capsule content are the same for the concerned strengths and only the amount of active substance is changed ; (iii) the amount of a filler is changed to account for the change in amount of active substance. The amounts of other core excipients or capsule content should be the same for the concerned strengths (d) appropriate comparative dissolution profile testing should confirm the ad equacy of waiving additional in -vivo bioequivalence testing . Similarity of the dissolution profiles across the physiological pH range between additional strengths of the generic products and the strength of the generic product used in the BE study should be demonstrated. In addition, CDP testing demonstrating similar profiles at the same dose (e.g. two 10mg tablets versus one 20mg tablets) may be required. If the data and justifications are considered not adequate, applicant will be required to provide relevant biopharmaceutics data, e.g. in -vivo BE study. Applican ts are advised to refer to the checklist \"Application For A Biowaiver: Additional Strength \" and su bmit relevant document s when requesting for biowaiver for additional strength . Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 16: Bioequivalence (BE) Requirements Page 8 of 10 5.2 BCS -based Biowaiver The BCS (Biopharmaceutics Classification System) -based biowaiver approach is int ended to reduce the need for in -vivo bioequivalence studies if an assumption of equivalence in in -vivo performance can be justified by satisfactory in vitro data. The BCS is a scientific approach based on the aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability characteristics of the drug substance(s). The BCS categorizes drug substances into one of four BCS classes as follows: Class I : high solubility, high permeability Class II : low solubility, high permeability III: (i) BCS-based biowaivers are applicable for immediate -release oral solid dosage forms with systemic action . (ii) For immediate release product in fixed dose combination, all the drug substances in the combination should meet the BCS -based biowaiver cri teria . (iii) B iowaiver may also be applicable if test and reference products contain different salts provided that both belong to BCS Class I (high solubility and high permeability). (iv) Drug products with buccal or sublingual absorption are not eligible for a BCS -based biowaiver application (v) Drug products having a narrow therapeutic index are excluded from consideration for a BCS -based biowaiver (vi) B iowaiver is not applicable when the test product contains a different ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of a drug substance from that of the reference product, since these differences may lead to different bioavailabilities not deducible by means of experiments used in the BCS -based biowaiver concept. Currently NPRA allows only BCS -based class 1 biowaiver application. Applicants are advised to prove that the generic product and drug substances are highly soluble and highly permeable with sufficient data and documentation as per requirement on the checklist Application For Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Biowaiver . BCS -based class 1 application should be product specific and should not based on list of substance i n the particular BCS class . If a generic product is to be marketed in several strength(s) and the submission is based on a BCS -based biowaiver approach, a complete set of documents is required for each strength, as it will be evaluated independently. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 16: Bioequivalence (BE) Requirements Page 9 of 10 In situation where the applicant is unable to provide satisfactory document s to support BCS - based class 1 biowaiver application, biowaiver request may not be considered and BE study should be conducted . 5.3 Waiver for Second Source Product In general, for a second source application of a generic product (immediate release, oral solid dosage form), BE study report from the actual manufacturing site must be submitted during the submission of application for registration. The base of this requirement is due to the difference in manufacturing site from the first source that may change the characteristic and specifications of a second source product. However, biowaiver may be considered as a surrogate to in-vivo BE study for the second source product , provided tha t all the following conditions are fulfilled: (a) BE study conducted using the registered first source product has been evaluated by NPRA and found satisfactory. (b) Comparative Dissolution Profile (CPD) data between the second source product against the registered first source product is submitted (c) The second source product is the same as registered first source product used in the BE study in terms of: Product formulation. Equipment used in the manufacturing process. Source and supplier of raw material. Quality control and specifications of raw material. Manufacturing process of product and standard operating procedures. Environmental conditions during the manufacturing process of product. Quality control and specifications of finished product. (d) CDP must be conducted in acco rdance to ASEAN Guidelines for T he Conduct of Bioequivalence Studies including the calculation of similarity factor (f2) to prove the similarity of these two products. (e) Process validation has been conducted on three pilot or commercial batches of the second source product and found satisfactory by the NPRA. This exemption is not applicable for any new submission of application for registration of a first source product. BE study must be conducted for this product whi ch is manufactured at the actual manufacturing site submitted for registration . Disclaimer: NPRA reserves the right to request for any additional information required for evaluation if deemed appropriate, to determine the product interchangeability of the generic product to the MCP .

Diabetes Mellitus: Hyperglycaemia in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotics use and glucose abnormalities is complicated by the possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes mellitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing incidence of diabetes mellitus in the genera l population. Given this confounders, the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and hyperglycaemia -related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiological studies suggest an increased risk of treatment -emergent hyperglycaemi a-related adverse events in patients treated with the atypical antipsychotics. Precise risk estimates for hyperglycaemia -related adverse events in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of d iabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g. obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycaemia including polydipsia, polyuria , polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycaemia during treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycaemia has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontin ued; however, some patients required continuation of anti -diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug. b) Adverse Effects/Undesirable Effects: Nervous System Disorders: Restless legs *Atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as <active ingredient>, have been associated with cases of sleep apnoea, with or without concomitant weight gain.

BENZODIAZEPINE The following statements shall be included in the package insert and RiMUP of pharmaceutical products containing benzodiazepine : Package Insert a) Warnings and Precautions: Risks from Concomitant Use with Opioids Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of [product name ] with opioids. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioids an d benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug -related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. If the decision is made to newly prescribe a benzodiazepine and an opioid together, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine in a patient already receiving an o pioid, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If the decision is made to prescribe an opioid in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.

SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the opioid have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and death associated with the use of opioids (See Drug Interactions). b) Interactions: Opioids Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines increases the risk of respiratory dep ression, profound sedation, coma and death. The concomitant use of opioids and benzodiazepines increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the central nervous system that control respiration. Opioids inte ract primarily at -receptors, and GABA A sites. When opioids and benzodiazepines are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid -related respiratory depression exists. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate (see Warnings and Precautions). Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory d epression and sedation.

CAUTION MUST BE EXERCISED WHEN OLDER CHILDREN ARE TREATED AVOID DIRECT APPLICATION INTO THE NOSTRILS Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 20: Specific Labelling Requirements Page 40 of 216 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) b) Warnings and Precautions: Carbimazole may cause white cell disorders such as neutropenia and agranulocytosis, which may be fatal if treatment with carbimazole is not stopped promptly. These reactions usually occur during the first 3 months of therapy, and in most case s, are reversible on stopping treatment. Since agranulocytosis can develop very rapidly, periodic leucocyte counts alone may not be effective in the early detection of these reactions. There have been post -marketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients receiving carbimazole or its active metabolite, methimazole In case of acute pancreatitis, carbimazole should be discontinued immediately. Carbimazole or methimazole (thiamazole) must not be given to patie nts with a history of acute pancreatitis after administration of carbimazole or its active metabolite methimazole (thiamazole). Re -exposure may result in recurrence of acute pancreatitis, with decreased time to onset. Women of childbearing potential and p regnancy Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraceptive measures during treatment. The use of carbimazole or methimazole (thiamazole) in pregnant women must be based on the individual benefit/risk assessment. If carbimazole or methima zole (thiamazole) is used during pregnancy, the lowest effective dose without additional administration of thyroid hormones should be administered. Close maternal, foetal and neonatal monitoring is warranted. c) Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation: Women of childbearing potential and pregnancy Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraceptive measures during treatment (see Section Warnings and Precautions). Pregnancy Carbimazole or methimazole (thiamazole) crosses the placenta but, provided the mother's dose is within the standard range and her thyroid status is monitored; there is no evidence of neonatal thyroid abnormalities. Studies have shown that the incidence of congenital malformations is greater in the children of mothers who se hyperthyroidism has remained untreated than in those who have been treated with carbimazole or methimazole (thiamazole). However, cases of congenital malformations have been observed following the use of carbimazole or its active metabolite, methimazol e (thiamazole) during pregnancy. A causal relationship to carbimazole Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 20: Specific Labelling Requirements Page 41 of 216 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) and methimazole (thiamazole) cannot be excluded. Therefore, the use of carbimazole or methimazole (thiamazole) in non -pregnant women of childbearing potential should be based on individual risk/benefit assessment (see section Warnings and Precautions). Cases of renal, skull, cardiovascular congenital def ects, exomphalos, gastrointestinal malformation, umbilical been reported. Therefore, carbimazole or methimazole (thiamazole) should be used in pregnancy only when propylthiouracil is not suitable. If carbimazole or methimazole (thiamazole) is used in pregnancy, the dose must be regulated by the patient's clinical condition. The lowest dose possible should be used, and this can often be discontinued three or four weeks before term, in order to reduce the risk of n eonatal complications. The blocking -replacement regimen should not be used during pregnancy since very little thyroxine crosses the placenta in the last trimester. Hyperthyroidism in pregnant women should be adequately treated to prevent serious maternal and foetal complications. Carbimazole or methimazole (thiamazole) is able to cross the human placenta. Based on human experience from epidemiological studies and spontaneous reporting, carbimazole or methimazole (thiamazole) is suspected to cause congen ital malformations when administered during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester of pregnancy and at high doses. Reported malformations methimazole (thiamazole) must only be administered during pregnancy after a strict individual benefit/risk assessment and only at the lowest effective do se without additional administration of thyroid hormones. If carbimazole or methimazole (thiamazole) is used during pregnancy, close maternal, foetal and neonatal monitoring is recommended (see section Warnings and Precautions). d) Adverse Effects / Undesirable Effects : SOC Gastrointestinal disorders Frequency \"Not Known\": Acute pancreatitis Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 20: Specific Labelling Requirements Page 42 of 216 NO.

SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) Mengandungi safety information/ statements shall be included in the package inserts of products containing Codeine: Indications [Product name] is indicated for the relief of painful disorders such as headache, dysmenorrhea, conditions involving musculoskeletal pain, myalgias and neuralgias. It is also indicated as an analgesic and antipyretic in conditions accompanied by discomfort and fever, such as the common cold and viral infections. [Product name] is an effective analgesic after dental work and tooth extractions. Codeine is indicated in patients older than 12 years of age for the treatment of acute moderate pain which is not considered to be relieved by other analgesics such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (alone). Dosing and Administrations Paediatric population: Children aged less than 12 years: Codeine should not be used in children below the age of 12 years because of the risk of opioid toxicity due to the variable and unpredictable metabolism of codeine to morphine. [Product name] is contraindicated in children below the age of 12 years for the symptomatic treatment of co ld. Children aged 12 years to 18 years: [Product name] is not recommended for use in children aged 12 years to 18 years with compromised respiratory function. Contraindications In children below the age of 12 years for the symptomatic treatment of colds due to an increased risk of developing serious and life -threatening adverse reactions. In all paediatric patients (0 -18 years of age) who undergo tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome due to increased risk of developing serious and life -threatening adverse reactions. In women who are breastfeeding. In patients for whom it is known they are CYP2D6 ultra -rapid metabolisers. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 20: Specific Labelling Requirements Page 56 of 216 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) Warnings and Precautions CYP2D6 metabolism Codeine is metabolised by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 into morphine, its active metabolite. If a patient has a deficiency or is completely lacking this enzyme an adequate analgesic effect will not be obtained. Estimates indicate that up to 7% of the Caucasian population may have this deficiency. However, if the p atient is an extensive or ultra -rapid metaboliser there is an increased risk of developing side effects of opioid toxicity even at commonly prescribed doses. These patients convert codeine into morphine rapidly resulting in higher than expected serum morph ine levels. General symptoms of opioid toxicity include confusion, somnolence, shallow breathing, small pupils, nausea, vomiting, constipation and lack of appetite. In severe cases this may include symptoms of circulatory and respiratory depression, which may be life -threatening and very rarely fatal. Estimates of prevalence of ultra -rapid metabolisers in different populations are summarised below: Population Prevalence % African/Ethiopian 29% African American 3.4 to 6.5% Asian 1.2 to 2.0% Caucasian 3.6 to 6.5% Greek 6.0% Hungarian 1.9% Northern European 1.0 to 2.0% Post -operative use in children There have been reports in the published literature that codeine given post - operatively in children after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy for obstructive sleep apnoea, led to rare, but life -threatening adverse events including death. All children receiv ed doses of codeine that were within the appropriate dose range; however, there was evidence that these children were either ultra -rapid or extensive metabolisers in their ability to metabolise codeine to morphine. Children with compromised respiratory fu nction Codeine is not recommended for use in children in whom respiratory function might be compromised including neuromuscular disorders, severe cardiac or respiratory conditions, upper respiratory or lung infections, multiple trauma or extensive surgical procedures. These factors may worsen symptoms of morphine toxicity. 3. Pregnancy and Lactation Pregnancy Careful consideration should be given before prescribing the product for pregnant patients. Opioid analgesics may depress neonatal respiration and cause withdrawal effects in neonates of dependent mothers. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 20: Specific Labelling Requirements Page 57 of 216 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) As a precautionary measure, use of [Product name] should be avoided during the third trimester of pregnancy and during labor. Breastfeeding [Product name] is contraindicated in women during breas tfeeding. At normal therapeutic doses codeine and its active metabolite may be present in breast milk at very low doses and is unlikely to adversely affect the breast fed infant. However, if the patient is an ultra -rapid metaboliser of CYP2D6, higher leve ls of the active metabolite, morphine, may be present in breast milk and on very rare occasions may result in symptoms of opioid toxicity in the infant, which may be fatal.

SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) abnormalities and concomitant treatment which may have been contributing factors (see Adverse Reactions). Epidemiological studies showed that domperidone was associated with an increased risk of ser ious ventricular arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death (see Adverse Reactions). A higher risk was observed in patients older than 60 years, patients taking daily doses greater than 30 mg, and patients concurrently taking QT - prolonging drugs or CYP3A4 inhibit ors. Domperidone should be used at the lowest effective dose in adults and children. Domperidone is contraindicated in patients with known existing prolongation of cardiac conduction intervals, particularly QTc, in patients with significant electrolyte disturbances (hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia), or bradycardia, or in patients with underlying cardiac diseases such as congestive heart failure due to increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia (see Contraindications). Electrolyte disturbances (hypokalaemia, hyperkalaemia, hypomagnesaemia) are known to be conditions increasing the proarrythmic risk. Treatment with domperidone should be stopped if signs or symptoms occur that may be associated with cardiac arrhythmia, and the pati ents should consult their physician. Patients should be advised to promptly report any cardiac symptoms.

If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. Effective contraceptive measures should be considered in women of child - bearing potential and should continue throughout the treatment period and for approximately 1 week (5 to 6 half -lives) after the final dose. There have been reports of multiple congenital abnormalities in infants whose mothers were treated with high -dose (400mg/day to 800mg/day) fluconazole therapy for coccidioidomycosis (an unapproved indication). The relationship between fluconazole use and these events is unclear. Adverse fetal effects have been seen in animals only at high -dose levels associated with maternal toxicity. There were no fetal effects at 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg; increases in fetal anatomical variants (supernumerary ribs, renal pelvis dilation) and delays in ossification were observed at 25 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg and higher doses. At doses rang ing from 80 mg/kg (approximately 20 -60 times the recommended human dose) to 320 mg/kg, embryolethality in rats were increased and fetal abnormalities included wavy ribs, cleft palate and abnormal craniofacial ossification. Case reports describe a distinct ive and a rare pattern of birth defects among infants whose mothers received high dose (400 -800mg/day) fluconazole during most or all of the first trimester of pregnancy. The features seen in these infants include brachycephaly, abnormal facies, abnormal c alvarial development, cleft palate, femoral bowing, thin ribs and long bones, arthrogryposis, and congenital heart disease.

GADOLINIUM BASED CONTRAST MEDIUM FOR MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAG ING The following boxed warning and warning shall be included in the package inserts of products containing Gadolinium Based Contrast Medium for Magnetic Resonance Imaging: BOXED WARNING WARNING S AND PRECAUTIONS Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA. For patients receiving haemodialysis, healthcare professionals may consider prompt haemodialysis following GBCA administ ration in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination. However, it is unknown if haemodialysis prevents NSF. Determine the renal function of patients by obtaining a medical history of conducting laboratory tests that measure renal function prior to using GBCA. The risk, if any, for developing NSF among patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency or normal renal function is unknown. Post -marketing reports have identified the development of NSF following - Exposure to gadolinium - based contrast agents (GBCAs) increases the risk for Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF) in patients with: acute or chronic severe renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate < 30mL/min/1.73m\u00b2), or acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to the hepato -renal syndrome or in the perioperative liver transplantation period. - NSF is a debilitating and sometimes fatal disease affecting the skin, muscle, and internal organs - Avoid use of GBCAs unless the diagnotic information is essential and not available with non -contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). - Screen all patients for renal dysfunction by obtaining a history and/ or laboratory tests. - When administering a GBCA, do not exceed the dose recommended in product labelling.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Hepatotoxicity Very rare cases of serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation have occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Cases have been reported that o ccurred within the first month of treatment, including some within the first week. The cumulative dose of the treatment is a risk factor for serious hepatotoxicity. Factors which may increase the risk of hepatitis are prolonged treatment with ketoconazol e tablets, females over 50 years of age, previous treatment with griseofulvin, a history of liver disease, known drug intolerance and concurrent use of medication which compromises liver function. A period of one month should be allowed between cessation o f griseofulvin treatment and commencement treatment with ketoconazole tablets because of an apparent association between recent griseofulvin therapy and hepatic reactions to ketoconazole tablets. Monitor liver function in all patients receiving treatment with ketoconazole tablets (see Monitoring of hepatic function). Patients should be instructed to promptly report to their physician signs and symptoms suggestive of hepatitis such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, jaundice, abdominal pain or dark u rine. In these patients, treatment should be stopped immediately and liver function should be conducted. Because of the risk for serious hepatotoxicity, [BRAND NAME] should be used only when the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks, taking into consideration the availability of other effective antifungal therapy. Assess liver function, prior to treatment to rule out acute or chronic liver disease, and monitor at frequent and regular intervals during treatment, and at the first signs or symptoms of possible hepatotoxicity.

SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) Monitoring of hepatic function Monitor liver function in all patients receiving treatment with ketoconazole tablets. Monitor liver function prior t o treatment to rule out acute or chronic liver disease (see CONTRAINDICATIONS), after two weeks of treatment and then on a monthly basis and at the first signs or symptoms of possible hepatic toxicity. When the liver function tests indicate liver injury, the treatment should be stopped immediately. A risk and benefit evaluation should be made before oral ketoconazole is used in cases of non -life threatening diseases requiring long treatment periods. In patients with elevated liver enzymes, or who have experienced liver toxicity with other drugs, treatment should not be started unless the expected benefit exceeds the risk of hepatic injury. In such cases, close monitoring of the liver enzymes is necessary.

OPIOID The following statements shall be included in the package insert and RiMUP of pharmaceutical products containing opioid : Package Insert a) Warnings and Precautions: 1. Risks from Concomitant Use with Benzodiazepines Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of [product name ] with benzodiazepines. Observational studies have demonstrated that concomitant use of opioids and benzodiazepines increases the risk of drug -related mortality compared to use of opioids alone. Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. If the decision is made to newly prescribe a benzodiazepine and an opioid together, prescribe the lowest effective dosages and minimum durations of concomitant use. If the decision is made to prescribe a benzodiazepine in a patient already receiving an opioid, prescribe a lower initial dose of the benzodiazepine than indicated in the absence of an opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. If the decision is made to prescribe an opioid in a patient already taking a benzodiazepine, prescribe a lower initial dose of the opioid, and titrate based on clinical response. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation. Advise both patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression and sedation when [product name ] is used with benzodiazepines. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until the effects of concomitant use of the benzodiazepine have been determined. Screen patients for risk of substance use disorders, including opioid abuse and misuse, and warn them of the risk for overdose and deat h associated with the use of benzodiazepines (See Drug Interactions). 2. Serotonin Syndrome with Concomitant Use of Serotonergic Drugs Cases of serotonin syndrome, a potentially life -threatening condition, have been reported during concurrent use of [product name ] with serotonergic drugs (See Interactions with Other Medicaments). This may occur within the recommended dosage range. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 20: Specific Labelling Requirements Page 146 of 216 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental -status changes (e.g. agitation, hallucinations, coma), autonomic instability (e.g. tachycardia, labile blood pressure, hyperthermia), neuromuscular aberrations hyperreflexia, incoordination) and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) and can be fatal (See Interactions with Other Medicaments). The onset of symptoms generally occurs within several hours to a few days of concomitant use, but may occur later than that. Discontinue [product name ] if serotonin syndrome is suspected. 3. Adrenal Insufficiency Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non -specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adren al insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement dosing of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal funct ion to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any p articular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. 4. Sexual Function/Reproduction Long term use of opioids may be associated with decreased sex hormone levels and symptoms such as low libido, erectile dysfunction, or inferti lity Undesirable Serotonin syndrome (See Warnings Adrenal (See Warnings and Precautions) Androgen deficiency: Cases of androgen deficiency have occurred with chronic use of opioids. Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic - pituitary -gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency that may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because the various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled for in studies condu cted to date. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation. Infertility: Chronic use of opioids may cause reduced fertility in females and Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 20: Specific Labelling Requirements Page 147 of 216 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) males of reproductive potential. It is not known whether these effe cts on fertility are reversible. c) Interactions: 1. Benzodiazepines Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma and death. The concomitant use of opioids and benzodiazepines increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the central nervous system that control respiration. Opioids interact primarily at -receptors, and benzodiazepines interact at G ABA A sites. When opioids and benzodiazepines are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid -related respiratory depression exists. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative trea tment options are inadequate (see Warnings and Precautions). Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation. 2. Serotonergic Drugs The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue [product name ] if serotonin syndrome is suspected. Examples of serotonergic drugs are selective trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) (See Warnings and Precautions).

WARNINGS AND P RECAUTIONS Skeletal Muscle Effects The use of fibrates alone may occasionally be associated with myopathy. The benefit of further alterations in lipid levels by the combined use of [Product Name] with fibrates should be carefully weighed against the poten tial risks of this combination. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 20: Specific Labelling Requirements Page 156 of 216 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with pravastatin co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when prescribing pravastatin with colchicine. Pravastatin must not be co -adm inistered with systemic fusidic acid. There have been reports of rhabdomyolysis (including some fatalities) in patients receiving this combination. In patients where the use of systemic fusidic acid is considered essential, statin treatment should be disco ntinued throughout the duration of fusidic acid treatment. The patient should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if they experience any symptoms of muscle weakness, pain or tenderness. Pravastatin therapy may be re -introduced seven days after th e last dose of fusidic acid. INTERACTIONS Concomitant Therapy with Other Lipid Metabolism Regulators: Based on post - marketing surveillance, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, other fibrates and lipid lowering doses of niacin (nicotinic acid) may increase the risk of myopathy when given concomitantly with HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors, probably because they can produce myopathy when given alone. Therefore, combined drug therapy should be approached with caution. Gemfibrozil and nicotinic acid: Gemfibrozil and nicot inic acid do not statistically significantly affect the bioavailability of pravastatin. However, in a limited size clinical trial, a trend toward CK elevations and musculoskeletal symptoms was seen in patients treated concurrently with pravastatin and gemf ibrozil. Myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, has occurred who receiving coadministration of HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors with fibric acid derivatives and niacin, particularly in subjects with pre -existing renal insufficiency. Cyclosporine : In a multicentre study, the AUC values of pravastatin were shown to be five-fold higher in the presence of cyclosporine. There was no accumulation of pravastatin after multiple doses Clarithromycin, colchicine: The risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis is inc reased with administration of clarithromycin or colchicine with pravastatin. Fusidic acid: The risk of myopathy including rhabdomyolysis may be increased by the concomitant administration of pravastatin with systemic fusidic acid. Co - administr ation of this combination may cause increased plasma concentrations of both agents. The mechanism of this interaction (whether it is pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetic, or both) is yet unknown.

Propylthiouracil should not be used in pediatric patients unless the patient is allergic to or intolerant of the alternatives available. 2The following boxed warning shall be included in the package inserts of products containing propylthiouracil: WARNING Severe liver injury and acute liver failure, in some cases fatal, have been reported in patients treated with propylthiouracil. These reports of hepatic reactions include cases requiring liver transplantation in adult and pediatric patients. Propylthiouracil should be reserved to patients who cannot tolera te carbimazole/ methimazole and in whom radioactive iodine therapy or surgery are not appropriate treatments for management of hyperthyroidism. Because of the risk of fetal abnormalities associated with carbimazole/ methimazole, propylthiouracil may be th e treatment of choice when an antithyroid drug is indicated during or just prior to the first trimester of pregnancy (See Warnings and Precautions).

PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPI) The following statements shall be included in the package insert and RiMUP of pharmaceutical products containing Proton Pump Inhitors (PPI): Package Insert 1. Warnings and Precautions : Regular Surveillance Patients on proton pump inhibitor treatment (particularly those treated for long term) should be kept under regular surveillance. Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (SCLE) Proton pump inhibitors cases of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). If lesions occur, especially in sun - exposed areas of the skin, and if accompanie d by arthralgia, the patient should seek medical help promptly and the health care professional should consider stopping {product name}. SCLE after previous treatment with a proton pump inhibitor may increase the risk of SCLE with other proton pump inhibit ors. Hypomagnesaemia Severe hypomagnesaemia has been reported in patients treated with PPI like {product name} for at least three months, and in most cases for a year. Serious manifestations of hypomagnesaemia such as fatigue, tetany, delirium, convulsions, dizziness and ventr icular arrhythmia can occur but they may begin insidiously and be overlooked. In most affected patients, hypomagnesaemia improved after magnesium replacement and discontinuation of the PPI. For patients expected to be on prolonged treatment or who take P PI with digoxin or drugs that may cause hypomagnesaemia (e.g., diuretics), health care professionals should consider measuring magnesium levels before starting PPI treatment and periodically during treatment. Fracture Proton pump inhibitors, especially i f used in high doses and over long durations (>1 year), may modestly increase the risk of hip, wrist and spine fracture, predominantly in the elderly or in presence of other recognised risk factors. Observational studies suggest that pr oton pump inhibitors may increase the overall risk of fracture by 10 -40%. Some of this increase may be due to other risk factors. Patients at risk of osteoporosis should receive care according to current clinical guidelines and they should have an adequate intake of vitamin D and calcium. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 20: Specific Labelling Requirements Page 163 of 216 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) Clostridium Difficile Diarrhea Published observational studies suggest that PPI therapy may be associated with an increased risk of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, especially in hospitalized patients. This diagnosis should be considered for diarrhea that does not improve. Patients should use the lowest dose and shortest duration of PPI therapy appropriate to the condition being treated. Vitamin B12 Deficiency Daily treatment with any acid -suppressing medica tions over a long period of time (e.g., longer than 3 years) may lead to malabsorption of cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) caused by hypo - or achlorhydria. Rare reports of cyanocobalamin deficiency occurring with acid -suppressing therapy have been reported in the literature. This diagnosis should be considered if clinical symptoms consistent with cyanocobalamin deficiency are observed. 2. Adverse Effects/ Undesirable Effects : known\": hypomagnesaemia.

SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) 3. Warnings and Preca utions - Interference with laboratory tests Increased Chromogranin A (CgA) level may interfere with investigations for neuroendocrine tumours. If the patient(s) are due to have a test on Chromogranin A level, [product name] treatment should be stopped for at least 5 days before CgA measurements to a void this interference (see section Pharmacodynamic). If CgA and gastrin levels have not returned to reference range after initial measurement, measurements should be repeated 14 days after cessation of proton pump inhibitor treatment. 4. Pharmaco dynamic During treatment with antisecretory medicinal products, serum gastrin increases in response to the decreased acid secretion. Also CgA increases due to decreased gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may interfere with investigations for neuroen docrine tumours. Available published evidence suggests that proton pump inhibitors should be discontinued between 5 days and 2 weeks prior to CgA measurements. This is to allow CgA levels that might be spuriously elevated following PPI treatment to return to reference range. Consumer Medication Information Leaflet (RiMUP) i.

Interactions Contraindicated Drugs Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4: Concomitant use with medicines labeled as having a potent inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 If treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors is u navoidable, therapy with simvastatin should be suspended during the course of treatment. Gemfibrozil, cyclosporine or danazol: Concomitant use of these drugs with simvastatin is contraindicated. Other Drugs Other fibrates: The dose of simvastatin shoul d not exceed 10 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with fibrates other than gemfibrozil or fenofibrate. When simvastatin and fenofibrate are given concomitantly, there is no evidence that the risk of myopathy exceeds the sum of the indiv idual risks of each agent. Caution should be used when prescribing fenofibrate with simvastatin, as either agent can cause myopathy when given alone. Addition of fibrates to simvastatin typically provides little additional reduction in LDL -C, but further r eductions of TG and further increases in HDL - C may be obtained. Combinations of fibrates with simvastatin have been used without myopathy in small short -term clinical studies with careful monitoring. Amiodarone: In a clinical trial, myopathy was reported in 6% of patients receiving simvastatin 80 mg and amiodarone. The dose of simvastatin should not exceed 20 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with amiodarone. Calcium channel blockers: - Verapamil or diltiazem: In a clinical trial, patient s on diltiazem treated concomitantly with simvastatin 80 mg had an increased risk of myopathy. The dose of simvastatin should not exceed 20 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with verapamil or diltiazem. - Amlodipine: In a clinical trial, patients on amlodipine treated concomitantly with simvastatin 80 mg had a slightly increased risk of myopathy. The dose of simvastatin should not exceed 40 mg daily in patients receiving concomitant medication with amlodipine. - Niacin (1g/day): The dose of simvastatin should not exceed 40mg daily in Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 20: Specific Labelling Requirements Page 185 of 216 NO.

Please also refer to Appendix 22 : Educational Materials d) Fertility, Pregnancy and Lactation: Sodium valproate is contraindicated as treatment for epilepsy during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative to treat epilepsy. Sodium valproate is contraindicated as treatment for bipolar disorder during pregnancy. Sodium valproate is contraindicated for use in women of childbearing potential unless the above mentioned conditions of Pregnancy Prevention Programme are fulfilled (see Contraindications and Warnings and precautions sections) Pregnancy Exposure Risk related to sodium valproate Both sodium valproate monotherapy and sodium valproate polytherapy are associated with abnormal pregnancy outcomes. Available data suggest that antiepileptic polytherapy including sodium valproate is ass ociated with a greater risk of congenital malformations than sodium valproate monotherapy. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 20: Specific Labelling Requirements Page 191 of 216 NO. SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) Teratogenicity and developmental effects Congenital malformations Data derived from a meta -analysis (including registries and cohort studies) has shown that 10. 73% of children of epileptic women exposed to sodium valproate monotherapy during pregnancy suffer from congenital malformations (95% CI: 8.16 -13.29). This is a greater risk of major malformations than for the general population, for whom the risk is abou t 2-3%. The risk is dose dependent but a threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established. Available data show an increased incidence of minor and major malformations. The most common types of malformations include neural tube defects, faci al dysmorphism, cleft lip and palate, craniostenosis, cardiac, renal and urogenital defects, limb defects (including bilateral aplasia of the radius), and multiple anomalies involving various body systems. Developmental disorders Data have shown that ex posure to sodium valproate in utero can have adverse effects on mental and physical development of the exposed children. The risk seems to be dose -dependent but a threshold dose below which no risk exists, cannot be established based on available data. The exact gestational period of risk for these effects is uncertain and the possibility of a risk throughout the entire pregnancy cannot be excluded. Studies in preschool children exposed in utero to sodium valproate show that up to 30 -40% experience delays in their early development such as talking and walking later, lower intellectual abilities, poor language skills (speaking and understanding) and me mory problems. Intelligence quotient (IQ) measured in school aged children (age 6) with a history of sodium valproate exposure in utero was on average 7 -10 points lower than those children exposed to other antiepileptics. Although the role of confounding factors cannot be excluded, there is evidence in children exposed to sodium valproate that the risk of intellectual impairment may be independent from maternal IQ. There are limited data on the long term outcomes. Available data show that children expos ed to sodium valproate in utero are at increased risk of autistic spectrum disorder (approximately three -fold) and childhood autism (approximately five -fold) compared with the general study population. Limited data suggests that children exposed to sodium valproate in utero may be more likely to develop symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

SPECIFIC LABELLING REQUIREMENTS (SUBSTANCE SPECIFIC) If a Woman plans a Pregnancy If a woman is planning to become pregnant, a doctor experienced in the management of epilepsy must reassess sodium valproate therapy and consider alternative treatment options. Every effort should be made to switch to appropriate alternative treatment prio r to conception and before contraception is discontinued. If switching is not possible, the woman should receive further counselling regarding the risks of sodium valproate for the unborn child to support her informed decision -making regarding family plann ing. Pregnant women Sodium valproate as treatment for epilepsy is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment. If a woman using sodium valproate becomes pregnant, she must be immediately referred to a doctor to conside r alternative treatment options. During pregnancy, maternal tonic clonic seizures and status epilepticus with hypoxia may carry a particular risk of death for the mother and the unborn child. If in exceptional circumstances, despite the known risks of so dium valproate in pregnancy and after careful consideration of alternative treatment, a pregnant woman must receive sodium valproate for epilepsy. It is recommended to: - Use the lowest effective dose and divide the daily dose sodium valproate into several small doses to be taken throughout the day. - The use of a prolonged release formulation may be preferable to other treatment formulations to avoid high peak plasma co ncentrations. All patients with sodium valproate -exposed pregnancy and their partners should be referred to a doctor experienced in prenatal medicine for evaluation and counselling regarding the exposed pregnancy. Specialised prenatal monitoring should take place to detect the possible occurrence of neural tube defects or other malformations. Folate supplementation before the pregnancy may decrease the risk of neural tube defects which may occur in all pregnancies. However the available evidence does not suggest it prevents the birth defects or malformations due to sodium valproate exposure.

Things you must not do: - Continue taking sodium valproate or using your birth control (contraception) until you have discussed your pregnancy or your plan to get pregnant with your doctor. Things to be careful of: - Sodium valproate can seriously harm an unborn baby when taken during pregnancy. - The higher the dose, the higher the risks but all doses carry a risk. - It can cause serious birth defects and can affect the way in which the child develops as it grows. Birth defects which have been reported include spina bifida (where the bones of the spine are not properly developed); facial and skull malformations; heart, kidney, urinary tract and sexual organ malformations; limb defects. - If you take sodium valproate during pregnancy you have a higher risk than other women of having a child with birth defects that require medical treatment. Because sodium valproate has been used for many years it is known that in women who take sodium valproate around 10 babies in every 100 will have birth defects.

Therefore, use of [product name] is not recommended in patients under 12 years of age. Respiratory depression Administer [product name] cautiously in patients at risk for respiratory depression, including patients with substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre -existing respiratory depression, as in these patients, even th erapeutic doses of [product name] may decrease respiratory drive to the point of apnea. In these patients, alternative non -opioid analgesics should be considered. When large doses of tramadol are administered with anaesthetic medications or alcohol, respir atory depression may result. Respiratory depression should be treated as an overdose. If naloxone is to be administered, use cautiously because it may precipitate seizures.

Congenital Malformations Data derived from two meta -analysis (including registries and cohort studies) have shown 8.91 - 13.13%) of children of epileptic women exposed to sodium valproate monotherapy during pregnancy suffer from congenital malformations)2. This represents a greater risk of major malformations than for the general pop ulation, for whom the risk is equal to about 2 -3%1. Available data show that the risk is dose dependent.The risk is greatest at higher doses (above 1g daily). A threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established based on available data. The mo st common types of malformations include neural tube defects, facial dysmorphism, cleft lip and palate, craniostenosis, cardiac, renal and urogenital defects, limb defects (including bilateral aplasia of the radius), and multiple anomalies involving variou s body system. 2. Developmental Disorders Exposure to sodium valproate in utero can have adverse effects on mental and physical development of the exposed children. The risk seems to be dose -dependent but a threshold dose below which no risk exists cannot be established based on available data. The exact gestational period of risk for these effects is uncertain and the possibility of a risk regardless of when during the pregnancy exposure occurs cannot be excluded. Studies3-6 in preschool children show that up to 30 -40% of children with a history of sodium valproate exposure in utero experience delays in their early development such as talking and walking later, lower intellectual abilities, poor language skills (speaking and understanding) and memory proble ms. Available data show that children with a history of sodium valproate exposure in utero are at increased risk of autistic spectrum disorder (an approximately three -fold) and childhood autism (an approximately fivefold) compared with the general study po pulation6. Limited data suggests that children with a history of sodium valproate exposure in utero may be more likely to develop symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)7. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 22: Educational Materials Page 12 of 14 RECOMMENDATIONS 1. The use of sodium valproate had been restricted in pregnancy as such: In epilepsy - sodium valproate is contraindicated unless there is no suitable alternative treatment. In bipolar disorder - sodium valproate is contraindicated in pregnancy. 2. The use of sodium valproate in women of childbearing potential is contraindicated unless patient had been assessed and counselled appropriately on the risks associated with sodium valproate. 3. Treatment should only be initiated if other treatments ineffective or not tolerated. 4. Treatment sh ould only be initiated after pregnancy has been excluded (negative pregnancy test). 5. The benefit and risk should be carefully reconsidered at regular treatment reviews. Preferably, sodium valproate should be prescribed as monotherapy and at the l owest effective dose. A prolonged release formulation is preferred to avoid high peak plasma concentrations. The daily dose should be divided into at least two single doses 6. Carry out annual review and ad -hoc treatment review when required. The benefit and risk should be carefully reconsidered during every treatment review. 7. In the case where sodium valproate must be used during pregnancy, prenatal monitoring is recommended to detect any malformations. COUNSELLING POINT advise patient/ caretaker on the risk of congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disorders associated with sodium valproate. Inform patient also about the risks of untreated seizure or bipolar disorder. advise patient to use effective contraception without interruption through out the entire duration of sodium valproate treatment advise patient not to stop treatment abruptly and to urgently contact the doctor when planning for pregnancy or in the case of suspected pregnancy. ensure that patient has received educational materials such as patient card and patient guide that has been provided by the supplier of sodium valproate.

Please read this leaflet carefully and talk to your doctor of pharmacist if you have any question KEY POINTS : Sodium valproate is an effective medicine used to treat seizur e (epilepsy) and bipolar disorder. Sodium valproate can seriously harm an unborn child when taken during pregnancy and should not be taken by women and girls unless no other medicine works. Never stop taking sodium valproate unless your doctor tells you to stop. Always use contraception and do not stop using as long as you are taking sodium valproate. See your doctor at once if you are planning pregnancy or if you suspect that you are pregnant. Do not stop taking sodium valproate. Pl ease make sure that you receive the patient educational materials such as patient card and patient guid e from your healthcare provid er. What you must do if you are being prescribed sodium valproate: For women who are able to get pregnant (of child -bearing age): o When taking sodiu m valproate, always use reliable contraception and never stop using it so you do not have unplanned pregnancy as long as you are taking sodium valproate o Tell your doctor at once if you think you may be pregnant or know you are pregnant. o Never stop taking s odium valproate unless your doctor tells you to as your condition may become worse If you are thinking to get pregnant: o Arrange urgent appointment with your doctor if you plan to get pregnant or if you suspect that you are pregnant. Do not stop taking sodium valproate and contraception until you have seen your doctor. You can help by reporting any side effects that you may get directly to the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA) through the website https://www.npra.gov.my (Consumer Consumer Reportin g of Side effects To Medicines o r Vaccines ConSERF). Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 22: Educational Materials Page 14 of 14 INFORMATION ON THE RISKS TO THE UNBORN CHILD Sodium valproate can be harmful to unborn children when taken by a woman during pregnancy. Sodium valproate can cause serious birth defects and can affect the way in which the child develops as it grows. Birth defects include spina bifida (where the bones of the spine are not properly developed); facial and skull malformations; heart, kidney, urinary tract and sexual organ malformations; and limb defects. Because sodium valproate has been used for many years, we know that in women who take sodium valproate, around 10 babies in every 100 will have birth defects. This compares to 2 -3 babies in every 100 b orn in the general population. It is estimated that up to 30 -40% of preschool children whose mothers took sodium valproate during pregnancy may have problems with early childhood development . Children affected can be slow to walk and talk, intellectually l ess able than other children, and have difficulty with language and memory. In addition, disorders which affect the way a child communicates and interacts with others, for example autism, are more often diagnosed in children exposed to sodium valproate.

Implementation Timeline 9. Conclusion s Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 23: Patient Dispensing Pack for Pharmaceutical Products Page 2 of 10 1. PURPOSE To provide guidance on the implementation of patient dispensing pack or original dispensing pack for pharmaceutical products in Malaysia. 2. OBJECTIVE S Improve patient safety by: maintaining product integrity; prevent ing unnecessary exposure of the product; avoid ing product contamination due to handling , especially in non -GMP premise; and having f ewer steps in the dispensing process to minimise errors and improve efficiency. 3. DEFINITION Patient dispensing pack or or iginal dispensing pack is a ready -to-dispense pack with sufficient quantity equivalent to an amount not more than one month supply or per treatment for one patient's use. 4. BENEFITS Key benefits include : Improving medication adherence by e nsuring that patients know how to take their medications and the importance of their medicines Facilitating identification of the medicine with manufact urer's information Providing complete instructions on how to take the medicine Ensuring the stability of the product because the o riginal pack aging will maintain the integrity of the pack Prevent ing mix-ups (or contamination) during repacking and dispensing Facilitat ing recall of products because the required information can only be found on the original pack aging . The original packaging will have the batch number and expiry date information Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 23: Patient Dispensing Pack for Pharmaceutical Products Page 3 of 10 5. CRITERIA FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF PATIENT DISPENSING PACK The patient dispensing pack size should be based on the medication, intended use, recommended dosage and dosage form sufficient for one month supply or per treatment for one patient's use. This requirement does not apply for blister or strip pack. The m aximum permitted supply is one month but may be less depending on the intended use of the medication. The Product Registration Holder (PRH) is responsible for justif ying the proposed patient dispensing pack size based on these criteria as the dosing regimen for certain medication s may equate to large amounts of tablets/ capsules. The justification provided should also define one month supply, whether for 28, 30 or 31 days. Blister s or strip pack s are strongly recommended for solid oral dosage forms (e.g. tablets and capsules) . Bulk loose pack for supply of more than one month is not permitted unless proper ly justified by the PRH. Oral chemotherapeutics in tablet or capsule must be packed in blister s to reduce personnel exposure and presumabl e risk to minimise the toxic effect of the chemotherapeutics. 6. EXEMPTED PRODUCTS These requirements do not apply to the following products: Injectables, eye, ear and nasal drops, suppositories and pessaries Products for export only (FEO) Drug where the risk of issuing more than the amount required by the patient outweigh the benefits of the patient dispensing pack . E.g. products containing substances with potential for abuse or cytotoxic agents where precise dosing are required. Drugs where the dosing needs to be tailored according to patient's body weight . E.g. drugs used in oncology, HIV , etc. Medically critical products and hospital packs for rare diseases with very low volumes where it is not viable to produce special packs for a single market Products sold in devices with a fixed number of doses Situations where a patient dispensing pack is not appropriate will be considered on a case -to-case basis. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 23: Patient Dispensing Pack for Pharmaceutical Products Page 4 of 10 7. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION VARIATION APPLICATIONS Change in patient pack size (regardless of whether a new pack type is involved) shall be submitted to the Variation Unit , Centre of Product & Cosmetic Evaluation (PPPK) . The following s upporting documents are required: a. Justification for the new pack size and/or type; b. Accelerated stability data (3 or 6 months) and stability report for new pack types; and c. Commitment to provide complete real time stability data and report when available. Lists of products with recommended maximum pack sizes for oral liquid preparations and dermatological preparations are presented in Table 1 and Table 2 respectively. For tablets and capsules in loose pack, the maximum pack size will depend on the highest dosage and frequency per patient's treatment or one month supply. 8. IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE Implementation of patient dispensing pack has been conducted in a phased manner to ensure smooth transition and prevent supply disruption to patients. This implementation was made effective on 1 March 2008 on a voluntary basis and mandated on 1 September 2008 . All products , whether imported or locally manufactured, manufactured from 1 September 2008 regardless whether it is imported or locally manufactured will need to conform to the principles of this guide. 9. CONCLUSION S Patient Dispensing Pack is convenient, safe and improves the quality of dispensed medicines. It increase s efficiency in dispensing and improve s patient safety by reducing the risk and possibility of error. It also reduc es drug waste and promotes better use of resources.

INTRODUCTION Change of PRH (COH) refers to a transfer procedure for the purpose of changing the existing product registration holder (PRH) that is authorized to market a registered product in Malaysia to another holder. This procedure allows the registered product to maintain the sa me registration number. Once NPRA deems the application is complete, the outcome of the change of PRH application shall be decided by the Drug Control Authority within forty -five (45) working days . 2. CONDITIONS The application is subjected to the follow ing conditions: 1) An application to transfer the marketing authorization of a registered product shall be submitted by the existing PRH . 2) The new PRH shall be a registered company/ business with Companies Commissioner of Malaysia (SSM) and a registered QUEST user with NPRA. 3) The registered product intended for transfer to a new PRH shall have a remaining registration validity period of at least six (6) months . If the registration validity is less than six (6) months, the existing PRH sha ll first apply for renewal of th e registered product. 4) No change (s) can be made to the technical data or approved pharmaceutical / pharmacological information, including the texts of the product label and leaflet, except the name and address of the approved PRH. 5) In the interim, the existing PRH shall still bear the marketing authorization responsibility of the registered product. 6) The transfer shall come into effect on the day the DCA makes a decision on the outcome of the Change of PRH application. Upon the transfer of product registration to the new PRH, the authorization issued to the previous PRH will be cancelled as the product cannot be marketed simultaneously by two different PRHs. The new PRH shall then bear responsibility for the product. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 31: Change of Product Registration Holder (COH) Page 2 of 7 7) However, the existing PRH is still allowed to deplete remaining stocks and will still be held liable for any pharmacovigilance issues or quality defects associated with the product during the interim of the transfer. 8) The existing PRH or newly approved PRH shall submit a written request to deplete the existing stocks after DCA approval has been obtained for the transfer. The PRH that submits the request shall be held responsible for the batches and quantity requested in the event of any pharmacovigilance iss ues or quality defects associated with those product batches. 9) Application may be rejected if the applicant fails to provide satisfactory required documents within thirty ( 30) working days starting from the first date of correspondence by the evaluator. 3. SUBMISSION The existing PRH shall submit the application via the QUEST system and hard copy of original documents to NPRA. 4. PROCESSING FEE S 1. NON -REFUNDABLE processing fee s: - For a Traditional Product : RM 500.00 - For a Pharmaceutical Product (including : RM 1,000.00 Health Supplement) 2.

Introduction Consumer interest in health and self -care has expanded the market for a wide range of health supplements and traditional products. These categories of products have been used since the earliest history of humanity and have formed one of the foundations for healthcare in cultures throughout the world. With the increased use of such products and the broad spectrum of products classified under this category, it is important to ensure that the products consumed are safe for consumers. Evaluation of the safety of complementary medicine products (health supplements, herbal products and traditional medicine) must be done in a manner that is cost effective and science - based within the regulatory environment. Most ingredients might be considered as safe , consider ing the experience or history of long u se. When an ingredient is well known for a specific use, the assessment will be limited to published data (including traditional references). However, under certain conditions, additional data will be required to prov e the safety of the product , e.g. for a new active ingredient or a new combination of ingredients . Even if a product has been in use over a long period of time, chronic toxicology risks may have occurred but not recognized. 2. Objectives This Guideline a ims to provide guidance in submitting safety data requirements for assessment to facilitate registration of complementary medicine. 3. Safety Data Proof that a product is of quality, safe and as efficacious as claimed is a pre -condition for marketing o f a complementary medicine product. Safety is dependent upon the overall product formulation, its intended use, dosage, route of administration, duration of use and targeted group where applicable. Each active ingredient shall make a relevant and reasonab le contribution to the overall therapy and the quantity of each active ingredient shall be safe for the recommended use and range of dosage. 3.1 Safety data shall be required to substantiate the safety profile for the following complementary medicine product to be marketed but not limited to: a. New ingredients b. Existing active ingredients/products with new combination , new dosage, new delivery system, new methods of manufacturing or for use in a special target population (e.g. pregnant, lactating women, children, etc.). Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 33: Guideline on Safety Data Requirements f or Complementary Medicine Products Page 3 of 7 c. Existing ingredients/products with safety concern. Safety concerns may be newly emerging or established, and in some cases may need additional information to support safe usage in complementary medicine. These safety concerns may be addressed by including additional cautionary statements. 3.2 Safety substantiation might not be required for complementary medicine products that do not fall under items a. - c. as mentioned above. Traditional medicines with documented data; health supplements which have been consumed as food or is a food constituent within the normal usage limit or for those containing ingredients with well documented and established safety profile may also not require further safety substantiation. Further examples would include: i) Product containing the same combination (same number of active ingredients) as with another previously registered product with the active ingredients within limits previo usly registered. ii) Combination of vitamins and minerals within permissible limits iii) Formulary products 3.3 Some general principles on assessing product safety shall be as follows: a) Single ingredient For well -known ingredients such as vitamins or minerals and herbal ingredients, documented data will be accepted to demonstrate safety of use. If an ingredient has been used traditionally and documented that it had no safety concerns, the submission of t oxicology studies will not be required. However, if history of use is used to support safety, then the details of use must be consistent with its traditional use. If toxic effects have been reported or there is insufficient documented safety evidence and there are doubts concerning the product/active ingredient, submission of toxicological reports will be required. In a case when the anticipated intake of this ingredient is significantly higher than the estimated historical intake, or for which the histo rical intake cannot be assessed, additional safety data/studies will be required. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 33: Guideline on Safety Data Requirements f or Complementary Medicine Products Page 4 of 7 b) Combination products There are no special requirements for combinations of well -known ingredients such as vitamins or minerals. Each active ingredient and dosage will be assessed independently and according to documented data. The intended use/function of each ingredient mus t support a logical use of the combination in question and if for traditional use must prescribe to the philosophy of that culture. Like acting herbal ingredients are considered to have an additive effect. Therefore, the dosage of each active substance may be reduced as compared to its single use. The counteracting by one active ingredient to the adverse reaction produced by another must be explained. Illogical combination of herbs or ingredients having widely different therapeutic uses will require justifi cation. However, for a combination consisting of new active ingredients, toxicological and clinical data for finished product may be requested. This will also apply to new combinations of well -known ingredients. Safety data will have to be on the product with information on individual ingredients as supportive references. c) Target population It cannot be assumed that an ingredient is suitable for pregnant or lactating women unless evidence is provided to the contrary. If required, the product should carry the following statement: \"Pregnancy and breastfeeding: Insufficient reliable data\" or \"If you are pregnant /breastfeeding, please consult your doctor/pharmacist before taking this product.\" A product will also be generally assumed not safe for child ren unless proven otherwise. If the product has children dosage instructions, there must be evidence to fully demonstrate safety in children of that age. 4. Overview Information that will be required to substantiate the safe use of a product may include but is not limited to: 4.1 Literature search A comprehensive literature search which would include both positive and negative reports must be submitted. The search criteria used should also be mentioned and references cited. Certified translated copies by the recognised bodies must also be provided if the original articles are not in the English or Malay language. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 33: Guideline on Safety Data Requirements f or Complementary Medicine Products Page 5 of 7 4.2 Extent of use Information on extent of use in other countries may provide insight into the safety profile. The maximum amount of the ingr edient that is recommended or suggested for use as food may be provided as proof of safe use. However, the amount in the product should not exceed the recommended level. If evidence is to be based on traditional use, it must be clearly stated that the ing redient under review is equivalent to that used traditionally. Knowledge of chemical components of an ingredient will aid in safety evaluation by identifying potentially toxic constituents or constituents known to mimic or modulate endogenous intermediates . Modern extraction methods used may in some instances produce a substance that is compositionally different from those produced using traditional methodology. The industry should be able to capture the safety data of any abnormalities and or untoward adv erse reaction that might be occurred or derived from animal and or human study. Efficacy data will also often include information on adverse events that will be useful in safety evaluation. Evidence of the regulatory status of the product in other countri es may also be provided as supportive evidence to justify safe use of the product. 4.3 Pharmacological properties This would include pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies for medicinal use except for traditional products which will be based o n the philosophy of its traditional use. 4.4 Toxicology data The intended use and the duration of use whether it is for short or long term use will also determine the type of toxicity data needed, e.g acute and/or chronic toxicity . Other toxicity data which should be identified would include teratogenicity, carcinogenicity and mutagenicity data , where necessary. All evidence, both favorable and unfavorable should be included. Toxicity data could be derived from sources such as authoritative refere nce test or from animal and/or human study. T he Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development ( OECD ) Guidelines shall be used as a guide to conduct toxicity study on animals. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 33: Guideline on Safety Data Requirements f or Complementary Medicine Products Page 6 of 7 4.5 Human data Safety profile of an ingredient may be obtained from sufficiently powered prospective observational studies, clinical trials, dose -escalation studies, systematic reviews, retrospective meta -analysis studies or even observation of adverse events under controlled studies. 4.6 Post marketing surveillance Premarket safety studies are sometimes limited by the number of study subjects. When products are in wide use, detection of adverse events provides a strong surrogate for safety monitoring in the general population and in consumers who have chronic condit ions. Post marketing surveillance also provides valuable information about a product's safety profile in vulnerable populations e.g. in pregnancy, lactation, the elderly etc. Interaction with other medications/ supplementation or even food has significan t safety implications because of their effects on bioavailability or induction/inhibition of metabolizing enzymes. Such interaction may lead to synergism or antagonism of intended effects. Safety concerns from existing products may come from the reportin g of the adverse reaction monitoring mechanism in the market or through post market control. The industry and regulator may collect those data from post -market reporting and should assess the causality between the emerging safety concern and the product. 5. Glossary 5.1 New ingredient New ingredient refers to complementary medicine active ingredient/excipient that has never been listed in the QUEST database. 5.2 New delivery system New delivery system involves a change in the method of administration and/or the physical dosage form of a complementary medicine product. 5.3 New combination A combination product, even if it consists of only existing ingredients, is regarded as a New C ombination , when no product of the same composition (in terms of the constituent ingredients and their relative quantities if higher than documented limits) had been approved for marketing in Malaysia before. Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD) Third Edition, Fourth Revision January 2023 Appendix 33: Guideline on Safety Data Requirements f or Complementary Medicine Products Page 7 of 7 5.4 New dosage New dosage refers to the quantity of ingredients/ substances to be used in a daily dose as well as single dose basis, if higher than documented limits. 5.5 Recognised bodies (with reference to translation of documents) Certified translators, embassies, Malaysia Pharmaceutical Society (MPS), Malaysian Organisation of Pharmaceutical Industries (MOPI), Pharmaceutical Association of Malaysia (PhAMA), Malaysian Dietary Supplement Association (MADSA), Federation of Chinese Phy sicians & Medicine -Dealers Association of Malaysia (FCPMDAM), Federation of Chinese Physicians & Acupuncturists Association of Malaysia (FCPAAM), Malaysian Chinese Medical Association (MCMA), Direct Selling Association of Malaysia (DSAM), Malaysian Direct Malaysian Association of Traditional Indi an Medicine (PEPTIM), and related industry associations of the country of origin recognized by the local authority. 6.
