Even though Wikipedia generally encourages usage of secondary sources, it is not wrong to use minority publications on a page about themselves. When writing a minority subject page there is a risk ending up to write it only as some majorities see them. That is not in accordance with the [NPOV](/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view) policy. It sais on [Wikipedia:Attribution](/wiki/Wikipedia:Attribution) that secondary sources should be used wherever possible, however, in many cases on a page like this it is not possible. I've been going through policy pages and arbitration decisions and I don't think there is any reason why anthroposophical publications couldn't be used to state views of anthroposophists here. If an anthroposophical book says something which majority people find controversial, it is still not (usually) controversial that the author thinks that way. It can be put in as the author's view, or sometimes as a view of anthroposophists, depending on a book. I hope a peaceful solution can be found to this. I don't insist that pages should be written with brochure language or that there couldn't be majority views on it. I hope there will be a way of writing some fair descriptions of anthroposophical views, using anthroposophical sources, to make sure that these pages go along with the [NPOV](/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view) policy.

UNESCO has made no such claim (about the practical influence of anthroposophical ideas). Three authors are cited, one of whom was published in a UNESCO-published magazine about education. This is not the same as UNESCO making a claim. In addition, all three authors concur and no verifiable source disputes this. We need to find accurate wording here. Sourcing the claim to UNESCO is clearly inaccurate. [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) 19:34, 10 April 2007 (UTC) - If the claim is not from UNESCO, the the authors who are making the statement or the journal in which they are writing should be cited by name rather than simply stating their research as fact.

( As I believe I have mentioned several times before, three independent sources are cited, not just one. I have added a fourth, as well. None of these are anthroposophical sources. I believe that on this basis, and considering that no publication disputes this, it could be considered as an accepted fact. Nevertheless, we can state that \"a wide range of authors concur that....\" What wording would fit? Let's find a solution here and then introduce it into the article.

I've only just come across the article but it seems unusual to have such a small reference referred to so many times, if it is legitimate then some explanation is needed to avoid these comments being repeated.

It was requested that pretty much everything in the article be explicitly sourced, and various editors put fact tags everywhere (even for generally known information). At the same time, the range of sources was narrowed down severely in arbitration (for an article about Waldorf education, no sources connected to Waldorf education!!!) Thus the excessive citation to a single book. We probably could combine citations for a given section (when they all refer to the same book), if people are all right with this (and fact tags don't go up again as a result).

However, I think it's important because \"a scientific method\" usually refers to a very specified methodology used in sciences at the moment. Anthroposophists think that it's main idea needs to be taken and developed further, not just to use it as it is now. That is why it is better to say \"the clarity of...\" or something like that. There might be other and better ways to describe it, but there is a risk starting to invent them here, so I suggest that we would stay with the word clarity.

This reference is cited in the introduction of the article. It is an authoritative statement by a respected academic scientist on Anthroposophy. A copy is available on line. Yet HGilbert and theBee refuse to link to it. The Arbcom decision makes no mention of the avoidance of this host site in its ruling. The paper should be fully linked from this article, both in the citation and in the articles list. It is a key document for anyone researching the subject. [Lumos3](/wiki/User:Lumos3) 07:16, 19 April 2007 (UTC) - Hansson is not a scientist but professor of philosophy and the history of technology. Arbitrators did say at the time that waldorfcritics could not be used for source in controversial claims and not waldorfanswers or anthroposophic published sources either. This article falls in the gray zone, and in similar cases in the past months for articles on waldorf websites, where independent published article is reprinted on waldorf website, editors were told they couldnt link to the waldorf websites for those reprints. Hansson article is an interesting position but exageration to call it \"key document on the subject\". I personally think it is splittin g hairs that we cant go to those POV websites, pro or con, just for links to the web reprints for ok source there if we can tell it is reprinted with permission. This article says it has the permission (also others reprints on that website dont have copyright permission). But that was not the consensus interpretation when this questions came before. The consensus interpretation was not to link to waldorfcritics or any polemical type web sites for published sources to statements of controversy, pro Steiner or con Steiner. I think to go back on it now and argue about it again is not good for the progress of improving the articles. I think it is better to adjust to the earlier decisions instad of trying to overturn them. because otherwise editors just argue about rules instead of finding better sources, and the articles have benefited overall by editors abiding those decisions.

This has been discussed extensively earlier, in a way that still is documented [above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anthroposophy#Sven_Ove_Hansson_as_pseudoscientific_author) at this page, with all its non-relevant ad hominem personal attacks by a later banned editor.

I think that Hansson's article is perfectly fine to cite in this article as it seems to be a critique at the level of a [parity of sources](/wiki/Wikipedia:FRINGE#Parity_of_sources). We wouldn't expect to find Hansson's critique in a scientific journal because anthroposophy is not considered mainstream science, so it is perfectly reasonable to use him as a source of criticism. -- [ScienceApologist](/wiki/User:ScienceApologist)20:28, 26 April 2007 (UTC) - Hansson's article is acceptable as source the way it is done here.

Lately there seems to have been a number of references that have been deemed controversial because they suggest that anthroposphy is not a science or scientific discipline. It would be good for this article to determine whether this is actually a controversial standpoint. Does there exist a body of people who regard anthroposphy as an actual science rather that say a spiritual path or a philosophy?

If one looks at the wiki definitions of [science](/wiki/Science) it describes three different types of science: - Natural Science - Social Science - Formal Science It definitely wouldn't fall under the definition of the first two. But it could possibly fall under the definition of the third which defines the science of Mathematics and Logic as [a priori](/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori_(philosophy)).

[Lkleinjans](/wiki/User:Lkleinjans) 10:17, 26 April 2007 (UTC) - The article should not determine one or other but only report various opinions on this. Many such as Hansson argue to redefine science much more stictly than in the past. Everywhere the redefinitions are controversial. It is not just spiritual science where it is an issue. Also political science, social science, primatology, psychology are other examples where this is controversy and I think all the articles at wikipedia talk some about this controversy but not all do a good job. (weasel words, no sources given, ect) And some disciplines aim to be scientific but others can say it did not succeed as science, for example studying behavior in the wild whcih some argue is not true science.

Anthroposophy is not a synonym for spiritual science. Anthroposophy is a sub set. It is one of many theoretical and practical disciplines in the bigger category of spiritual science that are very different from each other. In the 19th century different figures like Henry James, Sr worked in spiritual science and that had nothing to do with anthroposophy. There are many others going back to. Also I know I saw a good description given in one of the sources I found to use in the Waldorf article. It is now an unorthodox view that there can be such thing as a \"science of spirit\" like there is \"science of physics\" or \"science of chemistry\".

How about: 'Anthroposophy claims to follow scientific methods (those of logic) in 'spiritual regions', such as thought, feeling and thinking of thinking (which it claims derive from the spiritual). But replication of spiritual research is difficult if not impossible; this is because thinking and feeling belong to the inner world of an individual while natural science belongs to the outer world of everyone'. How Steiner describes the spiritual in his writings is using the methodology of logic, just like a mathematical formula you either understand it or you don't from the evidence given; it uses [a priori](/wiki/A_priori).

You appear to be falling into the trap of legitimising a controversy that does not exist. (Digression: Logic in itself is no indicator of science as a logical deduction may be based on contrived premises as is the case with most world religions. In actual fact the forefront of science has always been characterised by observations that defy rational logical explanations. Todays examples include quantum mechanics, the theory of relativity and the distribution of prime numbers, which are all things that we can empirically observe yet cannot logically explain.)-- [Fergie](/wiki/User:Fergie)09:05, 1 May 2007 (UTC) - Well I assume it's the Anthroposophists that claim Anthroposophy follows a scientific method. I don't understand what you mean with legitimising a controversy that does not exist. With your comment I think you mean 'logic in itself is no indicator of natural science'. I know this argument is basic but: creationism is considered science in parts of the U.S. but not so in most of Europe. It just depends which assumptions (or as you call it 'contrived premises') one starts of with. Crudely, creationism: the bible is fact; evolution: the natural/physical world and the rules we derive from it are fact. - The point I'm trying to make is that we cannot decide for anthroposophists or for anyone else if Anthroposophy is a science, all we can do is state why it might be and why it might not be.

I have not heard of a group of people within the university world to consider anthroposophy as science (or if they do they do it privately). A sentence like anthroposophy is not a field of science in universities would probably be ok. But it is not possible to say as an objective truth that it isn't science, because some people (for example the anthroposophists) think it is.

Why? What for? Of course they are very useful sciences that have always helped people to live better in this strange and surprising world, as any good science has to do. The article fails only because it doesn't mention Helena Petrovna Blawatsky (the famous Madame Blawatsky, from Russia)the real founder of the Theosophy, a science that was trying to unify the principles of all religions of the world, and that afterwards was troubled by the strange behavior of Annie Besant about Krishnamurti. It is a known fact that Albert Einstein was a great reader of Blawatsky's books, that he would always regard as an inspiration. Just this would be enough to totally justify and legitimate the existence of Theosophy. And don't forget that Enistein himself was many times accused of pseudoscientist during his lifetime. In sum: the questionig is the main part of a science. Without questioning no science should be considered a science.(User: Dourado) 02:45, May 2007. - Your poorly edited rant makes little sense.

Let me first say that nobody believes Anthroposophy to be a so called \"natural science,\" or as Steiner referred to it a \"materialistic science.\" But to not call it a science, which is systematic knowledge of the world gained through observation and experimentation, would be wrong. It is a systematic study of the non-material world through observation and experimentation, and that is why it is distinguished from natural, or materialistic science. Someone might be able to think of it like this: If you are studying colors, you could study the wavelength, the light refraction, the sensitivity of various types of cone cells in the retina, etc. and this would give you an idea of how natural science studies color. If, on the other hand, you were to study color the way that Goethe did when he said \"Yellow is a light which has been dampened by darkness; Blue is a darkness weakened by the light,\" this would be a crude form of Anthroposophy. The reason being that Goethe used his past observations of light but then had to go beyond mere observation and actually use his imagination to introduce the varied degrees of darkness into light. There were no tools in Goethe's time to introduce \"darkness\" into light, so he had to use his powers of thinking to conduct the observation. This shows the power of Anthroposophy: it can go far beyond what can be studied from the senses; one can use their mind to study something when it cannot be physically studied and observed. Anthroposophy, from its method, can study a great deal more than natural science can since it is not limited to the physical, sense-perceptible world. The other benefit from it is that, if the observer wants to build upon some knowledge that has been attained through Anthroposophic Science, he or she increases their flexibility of thought, concentration, openness and receptivity, etc. Take the Goethe example again. If Goethe wanted to take \"dampened light\" or yellow, and introduce more darkness, he would have to imagine it clearly, and, if he did, he'd see all the varying shades of color that comes into being from mentally protracting the darkness. Obviously, this would increase his mental capacities. As for the question as to whether or not there are any respected thinkers who think Anthroposophy is a science--Yes, there are; quite a few, in fact. Richard Tarnas, Ken Wilber, Robert McDermott, Arthur Zajonc, the late Owen Barfield, to name just a few. That's just in the realm of science and philosophy; one might also say that Anthroposophy can be called an \"artistic science\" since it can be used to study the forms, such as colors and sounds. Many famous artists and authors, even Nobel and Pulitzer prize winning, have used Anthroposophy as a science to further their art. And as a \"religious science\" it has even been famously used by a \"unknown\" writer whose posthumous book, \"Meditations on the Tarot\" made Harper's \"Top 100 Spiritual Books of the Century\" and significantly influenced many of the top Catholic leaders and theologians. So the answer is that there are, without a doubt, some very prominent thinkers and academics who, not only believe Anthroposophy to be a science, but actually use Anthroposophy as a science. So I do not believe we can say that the broad term of \"academia\" does not recognize Anthroposophy as a science, as there are clearly very notable examples who believe it to be.

[Erdanion](/wiki/User:Erdanion)19:17, 17 May 2007 (UTC) - I'll continue of this down there. The point is that to \"sense\" anything is necessary to read (at least in this case) the article on Stein and on Anthroposophy. I am not trying to say it would be enough to understand Anthroposophy, but at least it would be useful to make sense in this discussion. The article's second paragraph explains that Anthoposophy develops from Blawatsky's Theosophy, and why it becames Stein's alternative to it. Without reading the article, is very complicated to accept as qualified, neutral or whatever, any evaluation, principally if it is supposedly based on an old and sterile pseudoacademic mambojambo on experimentalism, materialism, legitimacy, estatistcs, etc, all that universe that would make very happy Allan Sokal. I thought (in my poor foreigner english speaker way of thinking) it wouldn't be necessary to explain, because it should be just suggested, that as long as Einstein supported Theosophy, as I mentioned, he supposedly would also support Anthroposophy. It was a bit of humor and a bit of inmagination, not casually two important qualities of science nowadays. Im sum: of course I think that Anthroposophy is a specific science, a human (anthropo)science, but always a science, absolutely in line with sub-atomics particles studies, ecology, economy, astronomy, etc. If Einstein and that cat of quantic physics are considered science, why not Anthroposophy? Having that in mind, what is the point in saying no? Dourado - 23:50h, 17 May 2007 - Hi Dourado, I get the feeling that you are new to wikipedia. You need to check out [WP:ATT](/wiki/Wikipedia:ATT)-- [Fergie](/wiki/User:Fergie)17:31, 17 May 2007 (UTC) - The way I wrote the sentence is obviously present in Hansson's article, it's the context of this all, and he practically says so. The way sentence is written now (\"some\") doesn't sound right. It should sound that anthroposophy is not generally considered as science, and then there are some exceptions. It would be possible to write more about those exceptions in the article. [Erdanion](/wiki/User:Erdanion)06:39, 17 May 2007 (UTC) Fergie, I didn't quite understand your edit summary. I don't think there is anything controversial that anthroposophists see anthroposophy as science. Of course they do, that's the very main idea of anthroposophy. They think it as an extended science which goes beyond what the universities are doing at the moment. [Erdanion](/wiki/User:Erdanion) 18:18, 17 May 2007 (UTC) - Except they don't- they make vague allusions to a 'controversy', whilst saying that they themselves regard anthroposophy as more of a 'spiritual path' or 'philosophy' than a 'science'. Even the hardcore anthroposophical evangelists on this article have shyed away from saying that they themselves believe anthroposophy to be a science.

[Erdanion](/wiki/User:Erdanion) 19:17, 17 May 2007 (UTC) - I use the word 'argue' in this context to mean 'propose'. There exists a group of thinkers known as the [Flat Earth Society](/wiki/Flat_Earth_Society), yet this does not mean that it is controversial to say that the globe is roughly spherical. We need evidence of sensible academics regarding anthroposophy as a science- this could be in the form of literature, it could be the existance of an Anthroposophy department in a Science faculty, or it could be indirect references in scientific literature.-- [Fergie](/wiki/User:Fergie)19:47, 17 May 2007 (UTC) - I didn't bother to read the page of the [Flat Earth Society](/wiki/Flat_Earth_Society), but if they think that the Earth is flat, then inside a Wikipedia article of them you shouldn't say as an objective truth that it isn't.

I am not sure how relevant this is but it is a link to Steiner's book 'Occult Science'; [[1]](http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA013/English/RSP1969/GA013_c01.html). Where he specifically describes the 'Spiritual-scientific' realm. Steiner comparing spiritual against natural science: \"There is however an important difference, the moment we enter the spiritual-scientific realm, as compared with natural-scientific study. In Natural Science the facts lie spread out before us within the sense-perceptible world. Not so the facts of Spiritual Science. They only enter the realm of man's perception by dint of the soul's activity.\" This is not a quote saying 'Anthroposophists consider Anthroposophy science', but it compares natural science and spiritual science both as a science from the opinion of the founder of Anthroposophy. Is this link good enough to go in as a confirmation that Anthroposophists consider Anthroposophy as a science? If not, why not just write an email to one of the Anthroposophical Societies and ask for a statement?

It is \"The Passion for the Western Mind\": \"Steiner's epistemology along with Goethe and Hegel, and outlined in The Philosophy of Freedom (aka Intuitive Thinking as a Path of Knowledge), is the answer to the dilemma of the Descartian-Hegelian paradigm. It bridges the gap between the rational scientific outlook and the spiritual, putting body, mind and spirit back together.\" [|3 E |_ |_ 0 VV E |)](/wiki/User:Bellowed) 00:00, 18 May 2007 (UTC) - Thank you for all these, I'm sure they are helpful.

We keep writing that one sentence in the introduction differently. Would it be possible that we changed emails and had some more conversation that way?

[Erdanion](/wiki/User:Erdanion) 07:05, 19 May 2007 (UTC) - Fergie asked originally: \"Does there exist a body of people who regard anthroposphy as an actual science rather that say a spiritual path or a philosophy?\" The answer is a simple no - unless we count anthroposophists and/or a few other New Age proponents, who don't, per the arbitration ruling, have the credibility as objective sources on anthroposophy to be cited as experts on the matter. - Erdanion writes above: \"Here is the part from [Wikipedia:Neutral point of view](/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view)which is important for this topic: \"Minority views can receive attention on pages specifically devoted to them...\" This is not a page devoted to a minority view on anything; this is the main article on anthroposophy. - Erdanion writes above: \"Here is the part from - \"Views of the anthroposophists are important here, and since they think it's science, that should be on the page.\" The article can state that Steiner, and anthroposophists, also call anthroposophy \"spiritual science.\" There is no need to debate a far-fetched claim for which no evidence at all has been provided. Of course the article can reference what anthroposophists believe; that's what the article's about. What the article cannot do is muse over the question \"Is anthroposophy a science?\" Fergie established early on in this discussion, and no one has provided acceptable evidence to the contrary, that no one thinks so, except anthroposophists. We can describe their *beliefs*, we cannot sit around for instance musing over whether there's \"evidence\" that humans will some day live on Jupiter (as Steiner also stated and anthroposophists also believe). \"But I don't think anthroposophical academics can represent scientific community on this topic,\" - Exactly. \"We will have to spell out the majority viewpoint as well.\" No. We aren't obliged to \"spell out the majority viewpoint\" that a ridiculous claim is a ridiculous claim; otherwise anyone could insert into any article on wikipedia that the moon is made of green cheese, and expect a lengthy discussion on Talk pages to ensue as to where the \"scientific community\" stands on this question? \"We'll have to spell out the majority viewpoint that the moon is not made of green cheese.\" The majority viewpoint here is the default viewpoint that something isn't a \"science\" just because it claims to be, and there is no need to \"spell this out.\" The solution is simple, don't address (and thereboy confer legitimacy to) bogus claims in the first place.

I don't understand what point you are trying to make DianaW, there is no bogus claim, it just states what Steiner believed according to our sources and what the scientific community believes.

They cannot be cited in this regard, as they are anthroposophists and the arbitration ruling (correctly) disallows this. Tarnas is also not credible as a source for the \"some people think anthroposophy is a science\" claim, because he is an astrologer, and astrology is also a pseudoscience. (This is as if you want to add to the article \"2 + 2 = 5,\" and while you admit most people don't believe this, you've found some other guy who believes that \"2 + 2 = 7,\" and you've got a quote from this fruitcake saying that it is not unreasonable to believe that 2 + 2 = 5 . . . sorry, doesn't help your case.) - What happens in these articles is that anthroposophists and their apologists propose sources like this hoping others working on the page will not be informed enough to recognize the sources being proposed (and almost certainly that most readers of the article, new to the topic, would not recognize them as biased sources).

This discussion has some problems. A necessary starting point is to define \"science\". Without such a definition it is pretty hard to determine if anthroposophy falls within or without the boundaries thereof. In addition, there is no agreement on who the boundary keepers are. Scientists? How do you define scientist? Are physicists equal to sociologists? Hard sciences only? Where do you draw the line on which sciences are hard? I'd like to make a couple of suggestions. Instead of trying to define science, which is, I think we'll all agree, a pretty major project, or trying to agree on what science is without defining it, a pursuit which will have everyone going in circles indefinitely, why not look to the authorities on the subject: the philosophers and historians of science? And then, instead of concluding that anthroposophy is not science because the current academic world hasn't defined it as science or concluding that anthroposophy is science because the majority of the current academic world hasn't defined it as not science, because they have never considered the question, having better things to do, undoubtedly, why not just say something simple. Example: Anthroposophy uses the following terminology: \"spiritual science\" which is defined as follows--choose a standard anthroposophical definition--however, spiritual science does not currently fit within the boundaries of what is generally considered science--link to a quote defining these boundaries--end of statement. [MinorityView](/wiki/User:MinorityView) 00:57, 20 May 2007 (UTC) - Yes, I agree that for the purposes of this discussion anthroposophists appear to be employing a rather unlikely definition of science which seems to cover the arts, religion and philosophy. Even using this definition, actual proponents of the 'anthroposophy as a science' idea are still somewhat thin on the ground-- [Fergie](/wiki/User:Fergie)05:29, 20 May 2007 (UTC) I tried to think about this and maybe \"saw\" could be changed back into \"tried to position\". It would be better to write later in the article in what way Steiner or the anthroposophists see anthroposophy as science, if someone wants to write more about that. [Erdanion](/wiki/User:Erdanion) 12:02, 20 May 2007 (UTC) - \"Position\" sounds like a PR attempt. Steiner obviously genuinely believed that science could be extended into spiritual realms.

He is a PhD professor of philosophy and psychology who wrote a philosophy book that's actually a required text at many universities. But you shove him aside as an astrologer. He did write a book on astrology and the effects it has on psyche, but, hey, so did that famous astrologer named Carl Jung. If Ken Wilber is an Anthroposophist, that's news to me. Zajonc is an Anthroposophist. However, he was an academic first and he still is, and held in high esteem. Same with McDermott. So was Barfield. He was a noted academic before he was an Anthroposophist, and held in grand esteem (C.S. Lewis said about him that \"Barfield is the wisest of my unofficial teachers\" and comparing Barfield to the likes of Tolkien and himself, Lewis said \"he towers above us all.\") But hey, he studied Steiner, let's throw him out. How about Saul Bellow? Oh wait, he loved Steiner so much that he wrote an introduction to a lecture series of Steiner's. We have to throw him out. What about Andrei Bely? The writer that Nabokov called the greatest of the Russian writers? Oh yeah, he was an Anthroposophist and a close friend of Steiner's. So he was warped too. See, what you have here Diana, is an ideal situation. You can hide behind your ludicrous claim that \"there are no scientists or credible objective experts who can be cited as saying that anthroposophy is a science\" and then object to anyone who is a scientist or noteworthy, rational mind who believes that Anthroposophy is a science simply because they read Steiner and like it and therefore must be Anthroposophists. Some of them are, but they are also held in high regard in the scientific and academic community.

Hansson [has done an excellent job](http://www.waldorfcritics.org/active/articles/Hansson.html)of describing the way in which anthroposophy not only does not adhere to scientific method, but actually fails to meet Steiner's own criteria for definition as a science.

A [simple comparison](http://www.thebee.se/comments/Hansson-commented.htm)of what Hanson writes (in the article published in 1991, probably when he still was a PhD student) with the works by Steiner that he quotes immediately shows that he seriously misrepresents anthroposophy as developed separate from theosophy, and distorts the argumentation in the context from which quotes from works by Steiner are taken. Trying to stand out as \"scientific\" in this way in his analysis while failing to stand up to even the simplest criticism of the way he misuses published sources is one criterion of pseudoscience. And he's the best you've got? Also (not yet shown in [the analysis](http://www.thebee.se/comments/Hansson-commented.htm)of his article), the discussion of the three examples he uses to argue against the reliability of alleged predictions by Steiner partly is based on careless mistranslation, non-consideration of the social, conceptual and historical context from which the examples are taken and superficial to the extent of bordering on pure rhetoric. Both factors deprive the discussion in a large part of the article by Hansson of its possible scientific value regarding the subject it purports to be a discussion of. Not good enough, Fergie.

It is indeed your view only. The arbitrator you refer to has never once given an opinion on whether Hansson is an acceptable source - nor has any other arbitrator said this. Don't bluff.

No, I don't think you are kidding, it's obvious that you do believe that citing yourself and your own self-published web sites settles various official matters here. The number of times you have done this should be embarrassing you by now. We should start counting. You have referred to yourself as an acceptable source on wikipedia probably pushing a thousand times by now, if we trawled through the Steiner-related articles to count. You miss no opportunity to refer readers to your own web sites, which are propaganda sites. This is why I suggested to you that you try to get your \"rebuttal\" of Hansson's article published. It would then become citable. Of course, you should probably think this through first. If they did decide to publish your article, I think we'd see you pretty quickly give up the claim that other articles in the same publication couldn't be cited. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 12:20, 16 August 2007 (UTC) Hansson disallowed citation for controversial issues As for the use of Hansson as citation in the article on Anthroposophy, including as \"evidence\" of the pseudoscientific nature course](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education/Workshop&diff=94550572&oldid=94546843) when I [suggested](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Waldorf_education/Workshop&diff=94392478&oldid=94391413) that - \"authors, who have worked actively in a public capacity in organizations, on an ideological basis strongly critical of Waldorf education and anthroposophy, be considered as unreliable sources with regard to controversial issues in relation to Waldorf education and anthroposophy.\" Hansson was the probably main founder of the Swedish \"skeptics\" group \"Vetenskap och Folkbildning\" in 1982. He was for many years its chair person and still sits on the board of the group. The [analysis](http://www.thebee.se/comments/Hansson-commented.htm) of his article on anthroposophy confirms what Mr. Bauder described as applicable editorial Wiki principle for such writings as Hansson's - that they are to be considered to be unreliable sources on controversial issues in relation to Waldorf education and anthroposophy.

After a quick scan of the Hansson document I have not found any evidence that this citation supports the claim made in the article, i.e. The Hansson article does not talk about racism. If it does please correct me. So I have to agree with Thebee that the Hansson citation should be removed from the end of this sentence as it does not support it. Isn't it just an introductory sentence to the Ray McDermott et al quote anyway? Cheers [Lkleinjans](/wiki/User:Lkleinjans) 20:32, 24 May 2007 (UTC) Interesting choice of words, had to look up idiosyncratic. I am happy with the sentence, it is just the citation that doesn't work. I haven't found anything in the Hansson article that talks about unreserved adherence to Steiner's teachings and therefore also not about concerns raised with regards to this. I know this is quite petty but the Hansson article is not related to this sentence as far as I can see; and therefore should not be there as a citation! I am looking at the article 'Is Anthroposophy Science' on the waldorfcritics website. - If you have read the Hansson article could you please let me know which part you are talking about? Cheers [Lkleinjans](/wiki/User:Lkleinjans)09:01, 25 May 2007 (UTC) Hansson's article doesn't mention racism, so it doesn't seem to fit the racism part. I'll try to make an introductory sentence which would fit the quotation so well that it doesn't need another source. [Erdanion](/wiki/User:Erdanion) 15:02, 25 May 2007 (UTC) Removal of Citation The Hansson article applies to this sentence, he is part of the [scientific community](/wiki/Scientific_community) as he is a Professor at a University as I understand it and he posed the question 'Is Anthroposophy Science' and concluded that it is not. Therefore it is perfectly valid to use his article as a reference. I agree it doesn't represent all scientists but it is the best we got and I say we keep it until we find something better. [Lkleinjans](/wiki/User:Lkleinjans) 11:44, 26 May 2007 (UTC) - This is an acceptable reference for one philosopher's point of view, and should be used as such (given the paucity of references on the subject)!

[Lkleinjans](/wiki/User:Lkleinjans)11:52, 28 May 2007 (UTC) - I undid your revision of - The problem is very simple. - If a used citation for a statement does not state what is used as citation for, it cannot be used as citation for that specific statement, even if the statement were to be true. Hansson is not the \"scientific community\", he himself does not neither give a reference for a statement by an authoritative organisation, representing the scientific community, stating what is said in the sentence you insist on using it as citation for, or some sort of empirical study demonstrating what you use it as citation for. - At my talks page, you have written, - Later in the article, the Hansson reference is used in a somewhat more proper way. I'll come back to that. But you can't use the citation as basis for the broad statement \"Although he tried to develop anthroposophy as an extension of science, it is not generally considered to be such by the scientific community.\" for the reason I describe. Specific statements must be specifically, not just loosely and indirectly sourced, if questioned. - If you have such a source, give it, if you don't provide such a reliable source. If you can't, I'll remove the citation and the statement it is used as citation for, tomorrow.

It appears that most editors here agree on keeping the citation; if a better reference is found we can use that instead.

[Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) 14:50, 26 May 2007 (UTC) Overall I am happy with the article (it's pretty big!); it is quite well balanced in my opinion. Just one minor problem with the statement anthroposophical families under the heading Anthroposophical medicine. What is an anthroposophical family? [Lkleinjans](/wiki/User:Lkleinjans) 14:01, 27 May 2007 (UTC) - The 'Anthroposophical medicine' section is problematic, and should be heavily qualified with disclaimers or cut out entirely. The 'Architecture' section is about Steiners skill as an architect and nothing to do with anthroposophy. Little space is given to the Camphill movement which is perhaps one of the most commendable and noteable aspects of anthroposophy. A section on the disagreements/differences to Theosophy is also needed. If everybody is in agreement I could make these edits myself-- [Fergie](/wiki/User:Fergie)15:38, 27 May 2007 (UTC) - I agree that the Camphill movement section could do with more information, if you know about this please go ahead Fergie. The general disagreements/differences with Theosophy are covered in 'History'. I don't know much about the Anthroposophy/Theosophy split, if there is a lot to be said maybe it needs another article because this one is already of substantial size.

The architecture style which Steiner started is one important part of anthroposophical movement, and there are a lot of those buildings in many countries. It's not a bad idea to write more about the [Camphill movement](/wiki/Camphill_movement), could also be inserted into it's own article. [Erdanion](/wiki/User:Erdanion)19:07, 27 May 2007 (UTC) - There exists an article Do, please, add something more about Camphill if you like; I haven't found good sources here. The anthroposophic medicine section's first paragraph is very brief and largely serves to lead people to the main article on the subject. This should clearly stay as this is one of the most prominent aspects of anthroposophy in practice. I expect that you are focusing on the second paragraph, about mistletoe. This section really could be part of the anthroposophic medicine article; if you want to combine it in there, that's fine. The architecture section begins with Steiner but continues on about the work of more recent anthroposophical architects. I don't see a problem here. Once again, this is a place where anthroposophy has been applied, here in the arts. [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) 17:42, 28 May 2007 (UTC) I have to say, I'm very happy with the current state of the \"science\" sentence. It's accurate: it reflects the attitudes of the majority of scientists while allowing Steiner's thought to be accepted by some scientists--which is the case. Anthroposophy is accepted by some scientists, even though Diana W and Fergie won't admit it, yet most scientists do reject it and that's why the current sentence it the best we've come up with. So now I don't really have any major issues with the neutrality of the article. [|3 E |_ |_ 0 VV E |)](/wiki/User:Bellowed) 14:51, 30 May 2007 (UTC) I'd like to propose removing the tag, then, assuming Fergie's concerns are adequately met (Fergie?). [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) 15:37, 31 May 2007 (UTC) - I cannot say that I agree with the removal of the NPOV tag. The 'applications' section is particularly problematic as it gives anthroposophy credit for several things that are more correctly attributed to Steiner or others. We could reasonably attribute eurythmy, camphill, biodynamic farming, and Waldorf education to anthroposophy, however banking, architecture and medicine are all problematic.-- [Fergie](/wiki/User:Fergie)09:35, 21 June 2007 (UTC) - Such errors should be addressed. So if some activity is not correctly anthroposophy then it should be resolved, but it sounds like you raise fact and/or relevance disputes now rather than NPOV dispute. To help clean up I put relevance tag in article and will start a talk section wto work through these problems. [Venado](/wiki/User:Venado)13:34, 22 June 2007 (UTC) - Such errors should be addressed.

Then the disputes need references for verificaition, and need to be clear why subject is notable. - \"Banking\" relevence to anthroposophy was explained already, and I should not have included it under relevance tag. But in \"banking\" section are claims that don't have references yet. It not hard to say it is anthroposophy but it needs independent refs to verify facts given and notability. I now found flowforms references and update talk section for revelence below. [Venado](/wiki/User:Venado)00:02, 23 June 2007 (UTC) As usual: those whose present themselves as being here to \"improve\" these articles will not address or even acknowledge the point that Fergie made. We saw this just a week ago with the points that Antelan made here - almost 100% ignored. The replies are politely irrelevant. You give these guys just half an hour, and they will be back with a bulldozer to bury the discussion that any neutral party tries to start. I would suggest that this behavior is enormously, exquisitely uncivil. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 03:04, 23 June 2007 (UTC) I will take the liberty of repeating what Fergie said - which I consider to be the civil response when something someone has said is rudely ignored. Fergie said: \"these sections are included on dubious grounds to 'sell' anthroposophy as a socially relevant movement. In POV pushing fact and relevance are normally stretched in this way.\" [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 03:06, 23 June 2007 (UTC) - That's why we have the rule that only independent, nonpolemical, peer-reviewed authors should be cited to support the relevance of such matters. Fergie has a right to a personal opinion, of course, but those who qualify as verifiable sources for Wikipedia articulate a very different consensus: that these are relevant and important cultural phenomena. It is such sources that the article must reflect. [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)14:04, 25 June 2007 (UTC) Two of the three sources in the Banking section are anthroposophical. I'm sorry, but a link to the GLS bank's own web page is not an adequate way to source a notion such as \"these are relevant and important cultural phenomena.\" We get that they, and you, think they are an important cultural phenomenon; there are no sources provided that suggest anyone else does. In fairness I think you do get yourself mixed up as to what you are trying to document. If you just want to document that GLS is an anthroposophical bank, I guess you can use their web site. But nobody's disputing they're an anthroposohical bank. If you want to actually get at the heart of what Fergie originally criticized here - that the article at present is bloated with stuff that's supposed to make anthroposophy look very socially responsible and productive and busy, but which, outside the ranks of anthroposophists, few people have even heard of, let alone consider to be notable cultural contributions - you'd have quite a bit more work to do. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 02:52, 2 July 2007 (UTC) The third source, the Green Money Journal, gives a link to this journal's web site. Could someone point me to where the specific laudatory quote about RSF is to be found there? It's very interesting that there's as yet no article on wikipeida on the Rudolf Steiner Foundation. Nobody's had time yet, or is there some reason? [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 02:55, 2 July 2007 (UTC) From perusing their web site, I'm guessing the answer to this is that \"RSF\" wishes to downplay the connection to Steiner, much the way Kentucky Fried Chicken started calling themselves \"KFC\" to direct people's attention away from a word that had a bad connotation (\"fried\"). [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 03:02, 2 July 2007 (UTC) - Links to the GLS site document the basic facts about the bank only. You are correct that the Green Money Journal quote is not correctly cited; the correct citation has been re-added. You think that the Rudolf Steiner Foundation is trying to avoid being associated with Rudolf Steiner? Boy, they must be dumb, then; their name is cited prominently in all their publicity material and all the articles about them. Send them an email to point this out...or is this the old Scarlet Letter trick?? [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) 11:56, 2 July 2007 (UTC) Actually, that's exactly what I think. The web site buries the actual name \"Rudolf Steiner\" on an internal page, several paragraphs into their mission statement. It is the acronym \"RSF\" that features prominently on their materials, not the name \"Rudolf Steiner.\" [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 13:01, 2 July 2007 (UTC) \"their name is cited prominently in all their publicity material and all the articles about them.\" All *what* articles about them? That was my point. It seems a strange omission on wikipedia, given the thoroughness with which other anthroposophical projects have been advertised here. I'm guessing someone at the foundation asked you not to put them on wikipedia - the association hurts rather than helps them raise money. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 13:03, 2 July 2007 (UTC) - LOL [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)08:26, 29 July 2007 (UTC) You've got reason to laugh, I know, as long as you keep getting away with promoting your movement by stealth. The fact is that the name \"Rudolf Steiner\" does NOT feature prominently on the Rudolf Steiner Foundation's publicity materials. Isn't that interesting? Skeptics should ask why. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 12:15, 29 July 2007 (UTC) I urge readers to visit that site. [http://wwwrsfsocialfinance.org](http://wwwrsfsocialfinance.org) I would love to hear or be shown a page on that site where the name Rudolf Steiner figures prominently. I see it in tiny, grayed out letters at the bottom of the pages; I see him described as a \"social philosopher\" on the mission page in paragraph 4. I see no explanation of the connection of his movement or his ideas to the foundation. I see no mention of anthroposophy or threefolding. This very small example sums up the way this movement is working today and summarizes the gray areas in their ethics. The nonsense over at the \"right livelihood\" page is a similar situation. The connection to Steiner is buried. The song and dance can go on late into the night with the vigilant Steiner watchdogs here, making sure the controversial stuff stays buried. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 12:31, 29 July 2007 (UTC) - Every single page of the site states clearly \"Inspired by the work of Rudolf Steiner\" at the bottom. The text is clear to read, it's just not in your face. In addition, the website includes a [mission statement](http://www.rsfsocialfinance.org/about-rsf/our-mission/)that clearly states \"RSF is inspired by the insights of Rudolf Steiner, an innovative and far-reaching social philosopher of the early 20th century. He encouraged human beings to practice self-knowledge in order to rise above materialism and to take responsibility for the condition of the world.\" - You may wish that they made a huge deal about this - then you could call it promotion and adulation of Steiner. They are an independent organization, clearly not hiding the fact that they have been inspired by Steiner's ideas about social finance and social responsibility, as well as his larger philosophy. [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)13:54, 29 July 2007 (UTC) Hgilbert: \"Every single page of the site states clearly \"Inspired by the work of Rudolf Steiner\" at the bottom.\" LOL! Horsesh** Hgilbert. It is in the tiniest possible letters, grayed out. You do not operate under good faith here; you understand as well as I do that his name and his beliefs are deliberately downplayed at that web site. It is, indeed, the same reason Kentucky Fried Chicken started calling itself KFC. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 17:50, 30 July 2007 (UTC) - Following debates here is enlightening. Went and looked over the RSF web-site. This is an organization that may have started in Anthroposophy, but isn't stuck in it.

She is president of The Humphreys Group, a wealth management firm that she joined in 1989.\" and \"Sara Ellis Conant became a trustee in 2006. She is a senior consultant with Deloitte Consulting and specializes in assisting clients to identify their core values and make them operational\" and \"Mark Retzloff became a trustee in 2006. He is the co-founder, President, Chief Organic Officer and board member for Aurora Organic Dairy, an organic company, which initiated production in 2004.

She is founding partner and COO of HAPPYBABY, a start-up company that produces and markets fresh-frozen, all organic baby and toddler meals\" of course some members of the Board have waldorf school connections, but these are very successful, people, alternative, yes. In addition, of the organizations that RSF is helping out with either loans, or grants, many are clearly not anthroposophical at all, not even slightly. Here are a few: American Friends Service Committee, Anna Lapp\u00e9 for Grub Campaign, CARE, Co-op America, Cross Cultural Journeys Foundation, Doctors Without Borders. Certainly, many grant recipients and/or loan recipients are anthroposophical organizations, but RSF isn't pretending anything as far as I can see. They walk their talk quite impressively!

Certainly, many grant recipients and/or loan recipients are anthroposophical organizations, but RSF isn't pretending anything as far as I can see. They walk their talk quite impressively! - The size and coloring are similar for basic links or information that appears at the bottom of many institutions' websites, e.g. [CNN](http://edition.cnn.com/), where they are, I suppose, being disappointingly \"hush-hush\" about the fact that their material is copyrighted, and about their connection to the Time-Warner company.

[MinorityView](/wiki/User:MinorityView)20:25, 31 July 2007 (UTC) - DianaW it seems to me that you are straining on this one to find something negative to say. Source? One sentence in the article says: - \"He wrote that he had direct experience of the Akashic Records (sometimes called the \"Akasha Chronicle\"), ...\" While RS wrote about the AC as if he could experience it, I don't remember ever reading that he stated or wrote something like \"hey guys, I have direct experiece of the AC\". So, can anyone provide a source for the quoted statement in the article? Otherwise it needs to be corrected in accordance with a source (Steiner himself needed). Thanks, [Thebee](/wiki/User:Thebee) 11:11, 20 June 2007 (UTC) believed and demonstrated RookZERO: An attribution to a source should be faithful to that source. Schneider states that Steiner demonstrated this, not that he believed this. Please read the source before modifying! Also: when Lindenberg states something, it is inaccurate to say that Steiner says this. [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) 00:29, 21 June 2007 (UTC) Relevance tag in applications section I have marked questionable sections in Applications with a relevance tag. This includes 3.7 Organizational development and biography work; 3.8 Banking; 3.9 Speech and drama 3.10 and Other areas. I did not move medicine or architecture under relevance dispute because I think the tie to anthroposophy is made clear in the article. - I do not even understand what application 3.7 \"Organizational/biographical development\" is. In order for it to be notable at wp it needs references. What kind work it means needs to be described if it stays. - 3.8 Banking needs a reference to claim. Also if it is relevant to anthroposophy the article needs to say how. - 3.9 Speech and drama - has a source of tie of M Chekov to anthroposophy but this article does not explain what is characteristic or significant about anthroposophoc styled speech and drama. - 3.10 Other - Flow forms references do not give relevance to anthroposophy.significance of others listed not clear (phenomona of science, painting and sculture). Better referances needed to show relevance, and relevance should be described if it stays in article. Other wise it is just a list without information about relevance of the items in the list. [Venado](/wiki/User:Venado)14:11, 22 June 2007 (UTC) - I agree that the \"other\" sections are extremely brief (that's why they are grouped under other!). However, citations are already provided demonstrating their relevance and connection with anthroposophy. We could and should aim to expand these sections (and speech and drama) somewhat, as sources allow, but this has nothing to do with their neutrality of point of view. The sections on banking and organizational/biographical development have been modified to clarify; is this sufficient? A full account of any of these would require a small article of its own. [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)13:58, 25 June 2007 (UTC) Flowform/Society for Cancer Research I have found several independent referances showing Flowform tie to anthroposophy and will use them to try to improve that discussion. It is not a problem about NPOV because the refs show it is anthroposophy and notable, just the article here did not say this well.

You are a phenomenon. I can't help but say I admire your determination, and it is amazing to see just where your zeal will carry you. Just glancing through this article shows all manner of tricks going on. I merely glanced at the \"Flowforms\" information. Ref. 36 is a completely bogus reference, completely unacceptable by any wikipedia standard. Then my eye was caught by the confused mishmash that is presented in regard to mistletoe therapy. You have actually included a reference (26) that describes Rudolf Steiner as \"founder of the Society for Cancer Research\"! [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW)03:22, 23 June 2007 (UTC) - The sections are clearly aspects of anthroposophical work. This needs to be clarified in the article in some cases. The flowform source is of excellent quality in terms of its content, but it's not apparent who authored it or if its been published, etc. I would go for keeping due to the exceptional nature (video clips of flowforms in action, academic-quality text)...what do others think? - Is there a reason to think that Steiner did not found a Society for Cancer Research?

No, I never complained about his non-standard name-signature; ee cummings is one of my favorite poets. Controversial material needs nonpolemical, independent sources. Non-controversial material should be of as high quality, of course, but there are fewer restrictions on its provenance. In any case, I have discovered the author of what I claimed to be an \"academic-quality text\"; it is co-written by (and appears on the website of) a professor who \"received [his] Ph.D. in Computer Science from Imperial College London, and served as a senior and then principal scientist of the Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Unit of the Royal Brompton Hospital prior to assuming his current full-time academic post and becoming head of the Visual Information Processing (VIP) Group, Department of Computing, Imperial College in 1999.\" The second author is a doctor at Imperial College, London and a specialist in Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance at the National Heart and Lung Institute. This qualifies them by any standard, and I have added the authors' names to the reference. [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) 13:46, 25 June 2007 (UTC) - Okay, Hgilbert, I'll play ball. \"No, I never complained about his non-standard name-signature; ee cummings is one of my favorite poets.\" So maybe you'd prefer Peter confined himself to poetry. Either you or Venado stated that his signature \"peter\" on some internet forum disqualified him as a source here. (It was probably a typo, as I think he usually does use a capital \"P,\" but whatever.) The situation was exactly analogous to what is going on here with the flow-forms: you were trying to show that, despite the probable excellent academic qualifications and academic-quality text of the author in question, the nature of the web site where the material we were discussing was posted made the material itself, and the author himself, unacceptable as a wiki-source. You are now trying to claim the precise opposite for a source you would like to include here: that the fact that the author(s) of the page (according to you; not clear how you determined this) have demonstrably excellent professional qualifications means we should overlook the fact that the material you would like to cite is not, by any means, an academic article. Nor is it, by the way, \"academic quality.\" It is a page describing their personal interests in flow-forms. In other words, it is stuff they're apparently interested in. There are no academic papers, cited here or elsewhere, showing any effects or uses of \"flow forms\" other than as pretty fountains - which I agree that they are, by the way. Something is not an \"academic quality text\" just because its author is an academic; academics write all kinds of things that aren't academic. If Kilner and whatever the other guy's name is had written academic papers on flow forms, I'm sure you'd be citing them here. (I looked quickly and don't find any.) - And Steiner's contributions as a \"cancer researcher\"? We're going to drop that question and hope it goes away? - By the way, you need to check into the meaning of \"polemical.\" You use it without understanding, as a stick to beat someone with. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW)01:30, 26 June 2007 (UTC) - Actually, the two authors wrote a book on the subject of the heart, including a section correlating its form and function with flow-forms. If we ever write an article on flow-forms, it will surely be cited. The efficacy of mistletoe therapy, Steiner's chief contribution to cancer prevention, is documented in many medical journals; I have cited these elsewhere.

[DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW)01:31, 26 June 2007 (UTC) - In (Feb.) 2004, Peter S., that you seem to argue for as a reliable source on anthroposophy, in a public discussion commented on his writings on anthroposophy: - \"I am very critical of the academic realm and the stultifying conception of objectivity that is so often associated with it. That is one of the main reasons I have avoided an academic career so far and remained an independent scholar (...); one of my goals is to move historical discussions out of the academic realm so that non-academics can participate in them. My published work on anthroposophy is not objective in the sense I think you mean, and no competent reader could mistake it for such.\" - Not a very good source, even in his own words. [Thebee](/wiki/User:Thebee)09:18, 26 June 2007 (UTC) - In (Feb.) 2004, Peter S., that you seem to argue for as a reliable source on anthroposophy, in a public discussion commented on his writings on anthroposophy: - And in (May) 2001, again in his own words: - \"My articles on anthroposophy are indeed polemical\". - According to the main arbitrator, Mr. Bauder, polemical sources are to be considered unreliable. A closer check of P.S.' writings against the sources he claims to describe repeatedly also reveal what he writes to be unreliable. As such he's not a reliable source for Wikipedia articles on or related to anthroposophy. [Thebee](/wiki/User:Thebee)09:31, 26 June 2007 (UTC) - And in (May) 2001, again in his own words: - The problem is you aren't the \"competent reader\" to whom he refers, and don't understand the passage you like quoting so much. A few tiny hints: There are many academics who are critical of the academic realm, and it doesn't make them not academics. (It doesn't work like anthroposophy, where you can't criticize it and still be part of it.) There are people who avoid academic careers only to later pursue them, and vice versa. Quite a substantial number of academics pursue academic careers at the same time as a variety of other interests, or publish in other venues or write for other audiences. Nor is academic writing always objective nor intended to be, but that's another matter. Peter Staudenmaier has indeed obviously \"moved historical discussions out of the academic realm\" on many occasions. Nothing about this is relevant to our discussion here or to whether any of his writings are appropriate wikipedia sources. And though I've tried to explain this to the AWE squad a number of times, with little hope of you understanding, quoting the passage above does not convey the negative impression fo Peter Staudenmaier that you apparently think it does. It seems you think these remarks cast him somehow in a poor light, but many thinking readers will take something quite different from them than you do. (It may be that what confuses you is that I think he really means them.)

Mistletoe research is well-documented in established medical journals; I gave about 10 citations previously. A Canadian governmental health source is acceptable by any standard.

It depends on what the material is and what you are attempting to document by it. The flow form pictures on that web site document nothing other than the fact that these two authors are interested in this. Fergie was correct that you are just throwing stuff out that is supposed to make anthroposophy look cool and productive and all good stuff - the citations document nothing other than the fact that flow forms exist and some anthroposophists are interested in them (which I'd have to agree with you isn't disputed). \"Mistletoe research is well-documented in established medical journals; I gave about 10 citations previously.\" Weasel words, \"mistletoe research is well documented.\" Of course it has been researched, but the findings are not good. It is a fact some people have researched it, but there are absolutely no results of research showing it to be an effective cancer treatment - none. Your misunderstandings were long since explained to you - and there have been no findings in the I think 2 years that have elapsed since then. Your argumentation is disingenuous. MISTLETOE DOESN'T CURE CANCER, or probably even help - there is no citation that would show this. There are even some findings connecting it to earlier relapse in those with incurable cancers!

Is Rudolf Steiner Foundation self evident anthroposophy or is that disputed. The Triodos Bank and GLS needs reference that it is anthroposophic. The GLS sentence reference shows self claim to be first anthroposopic bank. Is that disputed? If it is dispute to it needs independent reference. Also the quote \"one of 10 best\" now is given to both Co-Op america and Social Investment Forum Foundation. Even though quote is from independent source (but probably not said by two agencies) is it to promotional to quote for encyclopedia? [Venado](/wiki/User:Venado) 14:44, 23 June 2007 (UTC) - Not every single statement in an encyclopedia article needs a citation.

[Venado](/wiki/User:Venado)13:53, 23 June 2007 (UTC) False accusation of censorship of talk page Some facts On 19 May, Diana W in violation of the rules for contributions to discussions at talks pages, as part of her and Pete's anti-Waldorf and anti-anthroposophy jihad here at Wikipedia since last year, added the comments she mentions, not in its proper place at the bottom of the talks page, but at [the top](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anthroposophy&diff=next&oldid=131972071#Karma_and_Reincarnation) of the page. When the discussion from the period 8 December 2006 - 20 March 2007 was [archived on 25 May 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anthroposophy/Archive_4&action=history) as [Archive 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Anthroposophy/Archive_4) by Lkleinjans, he does not seem to have noticed the irregular out of order postings by Diana, put by her at the top of the page instead at the bottom of it on 19 May, and they got archived together with the earlier discussion. No malintent or intent of censorship was probably involved on the part of Lkleinjans in this removal of what Diana W wrote on 19 May, just her own irregular positioning of her POV pushing by putting it at the top of the discussion instead of - like mostly everyone else - putting it at the bottom of the discussion. In a second step, this then now makes her describe this standard way of archiving discussions as \"censoring of talk page\". Have the addition on the issue or reincarnation and karma as part of the section \"Human being: body, soul and spirit\" been removed as part of a by Diana implied control and general \"censorship\" of the article by \"anthroposophists\"?

The latter category was just placed on this article. Perhaps I have missed the sources that were proposed?? The one proposed source, the Hansson article does not pass the stricter requirements from the arbitration that \"authors, who have worked actively in a public capacity in organizations, on an ideological basis strongly critical of Waldorf education and anthroposophy, be considered as unreliable sources with regard to controversial issues in relation to Waldorf education and anthroposophy.\" I [earlier](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anthroposophy&diff=prev&oldid=151495901) suggested there might be sources to support the Pseudoscience category but none has been proposed, and now I would like to ask also for a source that supports the Paranormal category, an authoritative source that states that anthroposophy is either pseudoscience or paranormal. Otherwise putting this article in either category is [original research](/wiki/Wikipedia:OR). Until such a source is provided, I think it is appropriate to remove these categories. Perhaps [User:Northmeister](/wiki/User:Northmeister) can cite a source that supports adding the Paranormal category.

Regards - -- [Northmeister](/wiki/User:Northmeister)03:36, 29 September 2007 (UTC) By unknown person proposed deletion of article Someone, not easy to identify, has proposed the deletion of the article. The proposition, found in the section [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy#The_Christ_as_the_center_of_earthly_evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy#The_Christ_as_the_center_of_earthly_evolution) cites a quote from a lecture by Steiner, found [here](http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/AntChr_index.html) on the internet, and put in the article by someone. Except for this quote from the lecture, by the main founder of anthroposophy, the proposal does not give any other specific motivation for the proposed deletion. It would be easier to understand this if the one proposing it identified him- or herself, and referred to a more specific policy violation, that would motivate the proposed deletion. If that is not given here in a day or two by the one who has suggested the deletion, I'll remove the proposal. Thanks, [Thebee](/wiki/User:Thebee) 13:33, 24 June 2007 (UTC) - Someone, not identified by the article history, put the proposal into the article earlier today.

[EPadmirateur](/wiki/User:EPadmirateur)19:37, 10 October 2007 (UTC) Mistletoe Hgilbert, let's try this one more time. Research on mistletoe is largely negative. The American Cancer Society says: \"A number of laboratory experiments suggest mistletoe may have the potential to treat cancer, but these results have not yet been reflected in clinical trials. Available evidence from well-designed clinical trials that have studied mistletoe did not support claims that mistletoe could improve length or quality of life.\" [http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Mistletoe.asp](http://www.cancer.org/docroot/ETO/content/ETO_5_3X_Mistletoe.asp) The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine says: \"Laboratory studies have found that mistletoe kills cancer cells and stimulates the immune system. The use of mistletoe to treat cancer has been studied in Europe in more than 30 clinical trials. Although improvements in survival or quality of life have been reported, almost all of the trials had major weaknesses in their design that raise doubts about the findings. For example, many of the studies had a small number of participants or did not have a control group. NCCAM is sponsoring a clinical trial of mistletoe, given in combination with the drug gemcitabine, for cancer. The study will look at toxicity, safety, and immune system effects of mistletoe extract when combined with this chemotherapy drug.\" [http://nccam.nih.gov/health/eurmistletoe/](http://nccam.nih.gov/health/eurmistletoe/) I am guessing you don't understand what a laboratory study is versus a clinical trial. Something that \"kills cancer cells\" in the laboratory is not a proven cancer treatment or even necessarily a promising thing to test - in *most* cases it is not. Something that stimulates the immune system can as well cause growth of cancer cells as kill them. The NCCAM is your best bet - these are folks who really do want to find a clinical effect if there is one, and they have not. Indeed they are sponsoring a clinical trial, but I am guessing you do not understand what the trial is testing (even though I have explained this to you in detail on other occasions). It is not looking at mistletoe's efficacy as a cancer treatment. The study is confined to \"toxicity, safety and immune system effects\" of mistletoe WHEN COMBINED with an already proven effective actual cancer drug (gemcitabine). In other words, they are trying to determine if it is worthwhile or actually downright dangerous for patients on gemcitabine to take mistletoe on top of it. There is no expectation there that the mistletoe will turn out to cure the cancer. (It would probably be unethical to run such a trial, for conditions that do have remedies of proven efficacy.) These trials are often designed in the hopes of finding clear contraindications to use of an alternative remedy, so that patients can be dissuaded from taking things that may be actually hurting them rather than helping (diluting the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical, increasing its toxicity etc.) [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 14:46, 2 July 2007 (UTC) Guess away. In Europe, especially Germany, there have been extensive clinical trials of mistletoe and it has become a widely accepted therapy. The USA is still conducting first trials. See the list of references I posted last time this came up for more information. [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) 19:56, 2 July 2007 (UTC) - Cite some of those trial here then - the ones that show efficacy of mistletoe as human cancer treatment. Any language will do, but it needs to be a trial that shows efficacy of mistletoe in treating human cancers. Also, please give the details of the trial (you use the plural, but just one would be nice) that you state is being conducted in the USA - the trial(s) that test(s) mistletoe as *human cancer treatment* - not the one trial that is apparently testing the safety, toxicity etc. of mistletoe administered in conjunction with gemcitabine. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW)20:33, 2 July 2007 (UTC) - What needs to happen here is not that you refer me for \"more information.\" I don't need more information. You need to get honest about the fact that there aren't any trials showing efficacy; what you're doing here is deeply unethical. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW)20:34, 2 July 2007 (UTC) - I'd still be interested in seeing even one of these supposed \"extensive clinical trials\" cited here, Hgilbert. You've had the better part of a month and have not provided a citation. My guess is you still haven't actually figured out what a clinical trial is. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW)15:01, 28 July 2007 (UTC) - DianaW to HGilbert: - \"My guess is you still haven't actually figured out what a clinical trial is\" - Looks like something intended as an insult.

An editor chopped up the article, making it difficult to realize that the citations so applied. [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)13:38, 29 July 2007 - There are extensive citations in the article There are not extensive citations showing the efficacy of mistletoe in human cancer treatment - there are none. Not a single one you cite above shows that. What is this, smoke and mirrors? [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 01:00, 30 July 2007 (UTC) I'm not letting you off the hook here. Please tell us which of the above studies shows efficacy (or even tests efficacy) of mistletoe in human cancer treatment, and give the quote(s) from the article or the abstract that say what the effect was in human cancer treatment. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW) 22:58, 30 July 2007 (UTC) - First of all, the section is now at [Anthroposophic medicine](/wiki/Anthroposophic_medicine)and the discussion belongs there. - First of all, the section is now at - Second of all, the National Cancer Institute says the following, which is accurately summarized in the article: \"Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) been conducted using mistletoe? Clinical trials using mistletoe to treat cancer have been done in Europe with unclear results. Most study results have been published in German. Although many of these trials have reported mistletoe to be effective, there are major weaknesses in almost all that raise doubts about their findings. Weaknesses have included small numbers of patients, incomplete patient data, lack of information about mistletoe dose, and problems with study design. Much research about using mistletoe to treat cancer has focused on its effects on the immune system. Although there is evidence that mistletoe can boost the immune system, there is no evidence that this enhanced immunity helps the body to fight cancer cells. The National Cancer Institute's PDQ clinical trials database contains protocol abstracts for clinical studies of mistletoe as a treatment for cancer.[1] \" [Hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) 15:29, 31 July 2007 (UTC) - This is an improvement, though we apparently have to be satisfied with an implicit admission that you do not have a clinical trial showing efficacy of mistletoe in human cancer treatment. It took a few weeks to get you to even implicitly acknowledge this, didn't it? this is what we are up against here - disingenuousness and fanaticism. \"See the NCI web site for more information\" - how many weeks did you go on repeating evasive stuff like this before admitting I was right? ANYTHING to suggest to the public that anthroposophy is benevolent, useful, productive, beneficial to society, perhaps even full of miracles. Unfortunately there are no studies showing efficacy of mistletoe in human cancer treatment. The last sentence above is still disingenuous; Hgilbert fails to note that abstracts for all these studies that one can go read about on the NCI's web site . . . don't show any efficacy. He's hoping to at least still convey the impression that all kinds of exciting research is going on here which will perhaps bear wonderful fruit any day. The entire effort is dishonest. It reeks. It is wrong to mislead cancer sufferers out of the vain hope it will bring more new believers to your movement. Have you had a family member or loved one suffer cancer? Anthroposophy has no cancer remedy. [DianaW](/wiki/User:DianaW)02:29, 17 August 2007 (UTC) I would like to point out that I requested citations for the alleged \"extensive clinical trials\" showing efficacy of this anthroposophical remedy in human cancer treatment on 2 July, 30 July, and 17 August. As of 29 September there has been no reply. I repeat that to mislead cancer patients in this way, in order to promote a cult and a guru, is wrong, and one of many things this cult should be held answerable for to the public.

It was clearer when in chronological sequence (1930s, present-day critiques, reply by A.S.) instead of (present-day critiques, 1930s, reply by A.S.) - the Nazis were also critiquing anthroposophy (though from an extreme-right position) when they stated it was incompatible with a racist ideology.

I don't know where to even start but the most obvious thing would be a complete rewrite of the \"Anthroposophy in brief\" section. How can you say something as nonsensical \"bring the clarity of the scientific method into spiritual endeavors\" without following up with an explanation of how they believe such an oxymoron could be acheived? It also seems that every possible inclusion of critisim has been tempered with some sort of \"clarification\" or excuse (ie Steiner's statements on race). Perhaps it would be easier if the article was simply filed under \"religion\" along with all the other types of \"revealed\" (ie. meaningless) knowledge.

The earlier wording emphasized that matters described here were \"Steiner's view\" of reality; the present version tends to drop these clarifications. Presumably one can assume that in a article about anthroposophy the point of view is clear. But I am not sure that it is a bad idea to emphasize this periodically.

If based on anyone, it is the spiritual heritage of Goethe, according to Rudolf Steiner. This should be corrected immediately. I feel i cannot do so because I don't have the proper sources available for the moment.

Please check them, as I am not able to fix them automatically :) - \"Willmann\" : - Carlo Willmann, Waldorfp\u00e4dagogik: Theologische und und religionsp\u00e4dagogische Befunde, - 3-11 - pages The Essential Steiner, - \"RAMcD\" : - pp. 299-301 - Robert \"Rudolf Steiner and ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:DumZiBoT)) 12:10, 1 August 2008 (UTC) - BTW, you can use [Template:rp](/wiki/Template:Rp)after a reference to give the specific page numbers of that reference. For example: - BTW, you can use - <ref name=RAMcD/>{{rp|299-301}} - This will show the reference like: [35]:299-301 Cheers, [EPadmirateur](/wiki/User:EPadmirateur)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:EPadmirateur)) 05:23, 22 August 2009 (UTC) - This will show the reference like: [35]:299-301 Cheers, Image copyright problem with Image:RSteiner.jpg The image [Image:RSteiner.jpg](/w/index.php?title=File:RSteiner.jpg&action=edit&redlink=1) is used in this article under a claim of [fair use](/wiki/Wikipedia:NFC), but it does not have an adequate explanation for why it meets the [requirements for such images](/wiki/Wikipedia:NFCC) when used here.

In article on Croatian Wikipedia I wrote that \"Anthroposophy is sum of esoteric knowledge, about spiritual nature of a human being, the world, and the universe.\" Education, agriculture, medicine and so on, could hardly be based upon any philosophy or a mere theory. -- [Gdje je nestala dua svijeta](/wiki/User:Gdje_je_nestala_du%C5%A1a_svijeta) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Gdje_je_nestala_du%C5%A1a_svijeta)) 20:28, 3 November 2009 (UTC) Theory comes from a Greek root meaning \"vision\". Philosophy is the love of wisdom. Vision and wisdom are pretty good bases for life, I would say. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert) ( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 08:20, 4 November 2009 (UTC) - They are good bases for life, but are they good bases for Wikipedia?! - Steiner based his insight upon clairvoyant cognition. I wonder if this is appropriate? - -- [Gdje je nestala dua svijeta](/wiki/User:Gdje_je_nestala_du%C5%A1a_svijeta)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Gdje_je_nestala_du%C5%A1a_svijeta)) 19:08, 5 November 2009 (UTC) Bad reference The first reference doesn't acknowledge Rudolf Steiner as an author. [90.219.156.46](/wiki/Special:Contributions/90.219.156.46) ( [talk](/w/index.php?title=User_talk:90.219.156.46&action=edit&redlink=1)) 21:04, 9 October 2010 (UTC) - The first edition of this text usually doesn't list Steiner as an author. Should we add him anyway? [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 22:52, 9 October 2010 (UTC) - The bulk of the book is written by Steiner, as the front of the book makes clear but the reference doesn't. It seems disingenuous at least and merely a way to inflate the credibility of a 'fringe theory'. I am trying to approach this article with due respect to both it and Wiki by reading the Wiki guidlines first and would like to see a bit more of the Wiki advice applied to this article: \"Wikipedia is neither a publisher of original thought nor a soapbox for self-promotion and advertising. The notability of a fringe theory must be judged by statements from verifiable and reliable sources, not the proclamations of its adherents.\" [90.219.156.46](/wiki/Special:Contributions/90.219.156.46)( [talk](/w/index.php?title=User_talk:90.219.156.46&action=edit&redlink=1)) 13:51, 10 October 2010 (UTC) - Thanks for your interest. All of the article's citations are to verifiable and reliable sources at this point, as we've been through some massive review; for example, the sections from McDermott quoted here all stem from McDermott himself, not Steiner. [hgilbert](/wiki/User:Hgilbert)( [talk](/wiki/User_talk:Hgilbert)) 01:16, 11 October 2010 (UTC) - Thank you for your reply. I think it would be easy to establish R. A. McDermott as an adherent of Anthrosophy which means it is not a 'verifiable and reliable source' according to the Wiki guidance on fringe theories. Presuming of course that you agree this is a fringe theory. \u2014Preceding [unsigned](/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures)comment added by [90.219.156.46](/wiki/Special:Contributions/90.219.156.46)( [talk](/w/index.php?title=User_talk:90.219.156.46&action=edit&redlink=1)) 03:46, 11 October 2010 (UTC) - Thank you for your reply.
