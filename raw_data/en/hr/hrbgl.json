Brazil Abstract Homeopathy is based on the study of the symptoms caused by each substance given to a normal subject, and then applied to each patient who presents similar symptoms (similimum). However, there is still doubt regarding exactly the origin of these symptoms and how the medication act in the energy point of view . To demonstrate that the signs and symptoms presented by the patients could be related to the Five Elements theory (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal and Water) of traditional Chinese medicine and to expose the development of specific treatment with homeopathy medic ations for each massive organ of the Five Elements theory, treating the root and not only the symptom. Observational studies were conducted from Western medicine, homeopathic medicine, and traditional Chinese medicine. These different types of reasoning we re compiled on the metaphor of the tree, a diagram comparing the differences between the three approaches. Instead of treating the symptoms presented by the patients using homeopathic medications according to Western medicine reasoning (horizontal model), the author proposes the premise of the use of traditional Chinese medicine, in an energy based treatment (vertical model). Focusing on the root of the problem and not only on the symptoms.
