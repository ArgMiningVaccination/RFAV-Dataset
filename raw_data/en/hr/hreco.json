Many would be surprised to find that modalities such as homeopathy often work better than traditional treatments. Origins of Homeopathy Homeopathy has been around for over 150 years and was developed by Samuel Hahnemann, MD in 1755. He was looking at the medical methods of the time which involved treatments such as bloodletting, and the use of toxic chemicals, and sought a better alternative. How does Homeopathy work? Homeopathy is based on what is now called the pharmacological law of similars. It is based on the theory that like cures like. A very small diluted amount of something that would make a healthy person sick, cures a sick person with those symptoms. For example, an onion when cut causes your eyes to water and your nose to run. When it is diluted hundreds or thousands of times it will heal symptoms of hay fever. Several types of homeopathic remedies are used in our Downtown Miami office, the most commonly used are our Neuro-Emotional Techniques (NET) remedies. These remedies are started with a substance in a liquid form and then diluted thousands of times, sometimes to as much as one part per billion. Like all good homeopathic remedies, they contain several strengths of the same substance. Researchers have come to believe that homeopathic remedies work on the unseen fields that are utilized in eastern healing. Others believe that it causes a detoxification process that invokes healing. Some believe that it is just a placebo effect, however, that would not explain why it works on babies and animals. Homeopathy Vs Traditional Treatments People who are used to pills wonder how such a small almost nonexistent amount of a substance could possibly be effective. But many powerful substances in nature works the same way. A good example of this is pheromones. A hormone that helps opposite sexes in nature find each other for mating. Pheromones help even the rarest of animals find each other for mating no matter how far the distance. This is the mechanism by with rear pet reptiles released into the Everglades find each other for mating, no matter what or how far apart they are. Homeopathy Can Help with Detoxification One study poisoned some mice with arsenic, but with not quite enough to kill them. One group was given the homeopathic and the other the placebo. The group given the homeopathic were found to have copious amounts of arsenic in their urine and feces, demonstrating the detoxifying effects homeopathic remedies can have. Other types of homeopathic remedies are often recommended to our chiropractic patients with toxic conditions such as heavy metal exposure. NET remedies work with neuro-emotional technique, which is a body-mind technique that removes stress from past experiences that are affecting your current experience and health. They are effective, non-habit forming, and safe to take with vitamins, supplements, herbs, and even prescription medications. They target [acupuncture](https://drlisaowen.com/acupuncture) meridians, balancing their effect on related organs and emotions, and stimulate physical healing and emotional well being. Most people don't realize how much of their stress is caused by pain until they experience the greater sense of well being and reduction in pain brought about by properly administered homeopathic treatment.
