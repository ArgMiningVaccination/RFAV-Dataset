The 2008 Scorecard, which presents trends for each dimension of health system performance and for individual indicators, confirms that the U.S. health system continues to fall far short of what is attainable, especially given the resources invested. Across 37 core indicators of performance, the U.S. achieves an overall score of 65 out of a possible 100 when comparing national averages with U.S. and international performance benchmarks. Overall, performance did not improve from 2006 to 2008. Access to health care significantly declined, while health system efficiency remained low. Quality metrics that have been the focus of national campaigns or public reporting efforts did show gains. Support for this research was provided by The Commonwealth Fund.

Now in its second edition, the 2008 report presents current information and trends on the nation's progress toward achieving a system of care that affords better access, higher quality, and greater efficiency for everyone. In September 2006, the Commission issued the first National Scorecard as a means of setting realistic targets and monitoring change over time across a broad array of indicators of health system performance spanning healthy lives, quality, access, efficiency, and equity. The first assessment revealed substantial room for improvement across all dimensions. Despite many pockets of excellence, overall the U.S. performs far below what is achievable. This 2008 update of the National Scorecard shows that the nation continues to exhibit suboptimal performance relative to benchmarks. Despite high and rising health care expenditures, the U.S. is actually losing ground in providing access to care. Health care quality remains highly dependent on where you live and whom you see for care, which is inconsistent with the idea that all Americans receive the same high-quality care. At the same time, we can begin to see what is possible when there is appropriate leadership and concerted efforts to set standards of performance and ensure that improvement occurs.Although the task of moving to a system that is truly high performing is enormous, the stakes are even higher if we fail. The Commission's National Scorecard offers targets for change. The Scorecard underscores the need for new national policies that pursue coverage and improvements in quality and efficiency simultaneously. It is essential to start as soon as possible to realize the potential of accumulating substantial gains over time. The December 2007 report, Bending the Curve: Options for Achieving Savings and Improving Value in U.S. Health Spending , indicates it would be possible to save $1.5 trillion in national health expenditures over the next decade and improve the value of health care in the U.S., if aggressive efforts start now. With the upcoming 2008 presidential election, there is a window of opportunity to transform our health system to one that gives everyone the chance to lead longer, healthier, and more productive lives. In its report, A High Performance Health System for the United States: An Ambitious Agenda for the Next President, the Commission recommended five strategies for health reform that must be pursued together to move the nation in the right direction. We hope to see serious discourse and bold action\u2014enriched by these findings from the National Scorecard\u2014begin in earnest next year. James J. m ongan, m .d. s tephen C. schoenbaum, m .d.

Most are grateful for the care and attention received. Y et, evidence in the National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance, 2008, shows that care typically falls far short of what is achievable. Quality of care is highly variable, and opportunities are routinely missed to prevent disease, disability, hospitalization, and mortality. Across 37 indicators of performance, the U.S. achieves an overall score of 65 out of a possible 100 when comparing national averages with benchmarks of best performance achieved internationally and within the United States. Even more troubling, the U.S. health system is on the wrong track. Overall, performance has not improved since the first National Scorecard was issued in 2006. Of greatest concern, access to health care has significantly declined. As of 2007, more than 75 million adults\u201442 percent of all adults ages 19 to 64\u2014were either uninsured during the year or underinsured, up from 35 percent in 2003. At the same time, the U.S. failed to keep pace with gains in health outcomes achieved by the leading countries. The U.S. now ranks last out of 19 countries on a measure of mortality amenable to medical care, falling from 15th as other countries raised the bar on performance. Up to 101,000 fewer people would die prematurely if the U.S. could achieve leading, benchmark country rates. The exception to this overall trend occurred for quality metrics that have been the focus of national campaigns or public reporting. For example, a key patient safety measure\u2014hospital standardized mortality ratios (HSMRs)\u2014improved by 19 percent from 2000-2002 to 2004-2006. This sustained improvement followed widespread availability of risk-adjusted measures coupled with several high-profile local and national programs to improve hospital safety and reduce mortality. Hospitals are showing measurable improvement on basic treatment guidelines for which data are collected and reported nationally on federal Web sites. Rates of control of two common chronic conditions, diabetes and high blood Executive Summary EXHIBIT 1 Scores: Dimensions of a High Performance Health System Source: Commonwealth Fund National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance, /two.k/zero.k/zero.k/eight.k0 1002006 Revised 200875 72 72 71 67 58 52 53 70 71 67 65OVERALL SCOREEquityEciencyAccessQualityHealthy Lives10pressure, have also improved significantly. These measures are publicly reported by health plans, and physician groups are increasingly rewarded for results in improving treatment of these conditions. The U.S. spends twice per capita what other major industrialized countries spend on health care, and costs continue to rise faster than income. We are headed toward $1 of every $5 of national income going toward health care. We should expect a better return on this investment. Performance on measures of health system efficiency remains especially low, with the U.S. scoring 53 out of 100 on measures gauging inappropriate, wasteful, or fragmented care; avoidable hospitalizations; variation in quality and costs; administrative costs; and use of information technology. Lowering insurance administrative costs alone could save up to $100 billion a year at the lowest country rates. National leadership is urgently needed to yield greater value for the resources devoted to health care. THE NATIONAL SCORECARD The National Scorecard includes 37 indicators in five dimensions of health system performance: healthy lives, quality, access, efficiency, and equity. U.S. average performance is compared with benchmarks drawn from the top 10 percent of U.S. states, regions, health plans, hospitals, or other providers or top-performing countries, with a maximum possible score of 100. If average U.S. performance came close to the top rates achieved at home or internationally, then average scores would approach 100. In 2008, the U.S. as a whole scored only 65, compared with a score of 67 in 2006\u2014well below the achievable benchmarks (Exhibit 1).* Average scores on each of the five dimensions ranged from a low of 53 for efficiency to 72 for healthy lives. On those indicators for which trend data exist, performance compared with benchmarks more often worsened than improved, primarily because of declines in national rates between the 2006 and 2008 Scorecards. Overall, national scores declined for 41 percent of indicators, while one-third (35%) improved, and the rest exhibited no change (or were not updated). Exhibit 2 lists indicators and summarizes scores and benchmark rates. As observed in the first Scorecard, the bottom group of hospitals, health plans, or geographic regions is often well behind even average rates, with as much as a fivefold spread between top and bottom rates. On key indicators, a 50 percent improvement or more would be required to achieve benchmark levels. SCORECARD HIGHLIGHTS AND KEY FINDINGS The U.S. continues to perform far below what is achievable, with wide gaps between average and benchmark performance across dimensions. Despite some encouraging pockets of improvement, the country as a whole has failed to keep pace with levels of performance attained by leading nations, delivery systems, states, and regions. Following are major highlights from the Scorecard by performance dimension: heal Thy li Ves: a Verage s Core 72 Preventable mortality : The U.S. fell to last place among 19 industrialized nations on mortality amenable to health care\u2014deaths that might have been prevented with timely and effective care. Although the U.S. rate improved by 4 percent between 1997- 1998 and 2002-2003 (from 115 to 110 deaths per 100,000), rates improved by 16 percent on average in other nations, leaving the U.S. further behind. Activity limitations : More than one of every six working-age adults (18%) reported being unable to work or carry out everyday activities because of health problems in 2006\u2014up from 15 percent in 2004. This increase points to the need for better prevention and management of chronic diseases to enhance quality of life and capacity to work, especially among younger adults as they age. Quali Ty: a Verage s Core 71 Effective care : Control of diabetes and high blood pressure improved markedly from 1999-2000 to 2003-2004 for adults, according to physical exams conducted on a nationally representative sample. Among adults with diabetes, rates of at least fair control of blood sugar increased from 79 percent to *The overall score for 2006 changed from 66 to 67 due to revisions in baseline data and substitution of top U.S. states for countries as the benchmark for infant mortality.

Source: Commonwealth Fund National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance, 20081288 percent from 1999-2000 to 2003-2004. Among adults with hypertension, rates of control of high blood pressure increased from 31 percent to 41 percent over the same time period. Y et, a 30 to 60 percentage point difference remains between top- and bottom- performing health plans. Hospitals' adherence to treatment standards for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia also improved from 2004 to 2006, but with a persistent gap between leading and lagging hospital groups. Delivery rates for basic preventive care failed to improve: as of 2005, only half of adults received all recommended preventive care.Coordinated care : Heart failure patients were more likely to receive hospital discharge instructions in 2006 (68%) than in 2004 (50%), but rates varied widely between top and bottom hospital groups (from 94% to 36%). Hospitalizations increased among nursing home residents from 2000 to 2004, as did rehospitalizations for patients discharged to skilled nursing facilities\u2014signaling a need to improve long-term care and transitions between health care providers. Safe care : One key indicator of patient safety\u2014 hospital standardized mortality ratios\u2014improved significantly since the first Scorecard, with a 19 percent decline. Safety risks, however, remain high as one-third of adults with health problems reported mistakes in their care in 2007. Drug safety is of particular concern. Rates of visits to physicians or emergency departments for adverse drug effects increased by one-third between 2001 and 2004. Patient-centered, timely care : In 2007, as in 2005, less than half of U.S. adults with health problems were able to get a rapid appointment with a physician when they were sick. They also were the most likely among adults in seven countries surveyed to report difficulty obtaining health care after hours without going to the emergency department, and this rate increased from 61 percent to 73 percent since 2005. Within the U.S., there is wide variation among hospitals in terms of patient reports of how well staff responded to their needs. aCC ess : a Verage s Core 58 Insurance and access: As of 2007, 75 million working-age adults (42%) were either uninsured or underinsured, a sharp increase from 61 million (35%) in 2003. More than one-third (37%) of all U.S. adults reported going without needed care because of costs in 2007, versus only 5 percent in the benchmark country. Affordable care : As insurance premiums rose faster than wages, the share of nonelderly adults living in a state where group health insurance premiums averaged less than 15 percent of household income dropped sharply, from 58 percent in 2003 to 25 percent in 2005. By 2007, two of five adults (41%) reported they had medical debt or problems with medical bills, up from 34 percent in 2005. eFFiCien Cy: a Verage s Core 53 Inappropriate, wasteful, or fragmented care : In 2007, as in 2005, U.S. patients were much more likely\u2014three to four times the benchmark rate\u2014than patients in other countries to report having had duplicate tests or that medical records or test results were not available at the time of their appointment.Avoidable hospitalizations : Average rates of hospital readmissions within 30 days remained high, at 18 percent in both 2003 and 2005. Rates in the highest regions were 50 percent higher than in the lowest regions. Rates of hospitalizations for preventable conditions decreased somewhat from 2002-2003 to 2004-2005, but continued to vary two- to fourfold across hospital regions and states. Variation in quality and costs : Among Medicare patients treated for heart attacks, hip fractures, or colon cancer, a high proportion of regions with the lowest mortality rates also had lower total costs, indicating that it is possible to save lives and lower costs through more effective, efficient systems. The total costs of caring for patients with chronic disease varied twofold across regions. Administrative costs : U.S. health insurance administrative costs as a share of total health spending are 30 percent to 70 percent higher than in countries with mixed private/public insurance systems and three times higher than in countries with the lowest rates. Information systems : U.S. primary care physicians' use of electronic medical records (EMRs) increased from 17 percent to 28 percent from 2001 to 2006. Still, the U.S. lags far behind leading countries, where EMRs are now used by nearly all physicians (98%) to improve care.13eQuiTy: a Verage s Core 71 Disparities : Compared with their white, higher- income, or insured counterparts, minorities, low- income, or uninsured adults and children were generally more likely to wait when sick, to encounter delays and poorly coordinated care, and to have untreated dental caries, uncontrolled chronic disease, avoidable hospitalizations, and worse outcomes. They were also less likely to receive preventive care or have an accessible source of primary care. Reducing gaps : Among blacks and Hispanics, it would require a 19 percent to 25 percent decrease in the risk of poor health outcomes and inadequate or inefficient care to reach parity with whites. Gaps for uninsured and low-income populations are still wider: it would require a 34 percent to 39 percent improvement on indicators of health care access, quality, and efficiency to achieve equity with insured and higher-income populations. sys Tem C aPaCiTy T o inno VaTe and im Pro Ve: no T s Cored The capacity to innovate and improve is fundamental to a high-performing health care system. It includes: a care system that supports a skilled and motivated health care workforce, with an emphasis on primary care and population health; a culture of quality improvement and continuous learning that promotes and rewards recognition of opportunities to reduce errors and improve outcomes; and investment in public health initiatives, research, and information necessary to inform, guide, and drive health care decisions and improvement. On all three aspects, the U.S. currently under-invests in the capacity of the health system to innovate and improve. U.S. payment systems undervalue primary care and fail to support providers' efforts to manage and coordinate care. Studies indicate that health care teams and well-organized work processes can achieve significant gains in quality and safety with more efficient use of resources. Y et, health professionals are rarely trained to work in teams, and larger organized delivery systems that employ multidisciplinary health professionals are not the norm. There is little investment in spreading best practices, and incentives are rarely designed to reward or support improved quality and greater efficiency. In an era of rapid medical advances, national investment in research regarding clinical and cost-effectiveness\u2014what works well for which patients and when\u2014has failed to keep pace to inform health care decision-making. SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS PoTen Tial For im Pro Vemen T Overall, the National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance, 2008, finds that the U.S. is losing ground in providing access to care and has uneven health care quality. The Scorecard also finds broad evidence of inefficient and inequitable care. Average U.S. performance would have to improve by more than 50 percent across multiple indicators to reach benchmark levels of performance. Closing performance gaps would bring real benefits in terms of health, patient experiences, and savings. For example: Up to 101,000 fewer people would die prematurely each year from causes amenable to health care if the U.S. achieved the lower mortality rates of leading countries. Thirty-seven million more adults would have an accessible primary care provider, and 70 million more adults would receive all recommended preventive care. The Medicare program could potentially save at least $12 billion a year by reducing readmissions or by reducing hospitalizations for preventable conditions. Reducing health insurance administrative costs to the average level of countries with mixed private/public insurance systems (Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland) would free up $51 billion, or more than half the cost of providing comprehensive coverage to all the uninsured in the U.S. Reaching benchmarks of the best countries would save an estimated $102 billion per year. Studies further document the cost in lives and lost productivity from the nation's failure to provide secure health insurance to all. Based on areas within the U.S. that achieve superior outcomes at lower costs, it should be possible to close gaps in health care quality and access, and to reduce costs significantly. Several implications for policy emerge from the Scorecard findings:14wha T re CeiVes a TT en Tion ge Ts im ProV ed Notably, all of the quality indicators showing significant improvement have been targets of national and collaborative efforts to improve, informed by data with measurable benchmarks and indicators reached by consensus. Conversely, there was failure to improve in areas such as mental health care, primary care, hospital readmission rates, or adverse drug events for which focused efforts to assess and improve at the community or facility level are lacking. Further, the continued failure to adopt interoperable health information technology makes it difficult to generate the information necessary to document performance and monitor improvement efforts. BeTT er P rimary C are and C are Coordina Tion hold P oTen Tial For im Pro Ved ou TC omes a T lower C os Ts Hospital readmission rates and rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions remain high and variable across the country, as do total costs for the chronically ill. Studies indicate that it is possible to prevent hospitalization or rehospitalizations with better primary care, discharge planning, and follow- up care\u2014an integrated, systems approach to care. Multiple indicators highlight the fact that the U.S. has a weak primary care foundation. Investing in primary care with enhanced capacity to provide patients with round-the-clock access, manage chronic conditions, and coordinate care will be key steps in moving to more organized care systems. 1 However, current payment incentives for hospitals, physicians, and nursing homes do not support coordination of care or efficient use of expensive, specialized care.2 Information also fails to flow with patients across sites of care due to lack of health information technology and information exchange systems. These inefficiencies require innovative payment policies as well as care delivery approaches to improve outcomes for patients and use resources more efficiently.aiming higher The 2008 National Scorecard documents the human and economic costs of failing to address the problems in our health system. Recent analysis suggests it could be possible to insure everyone and achieve significant savings with improved value over the next decade.3 Health care expenditures are projected to double to $4 trillion, or 20 percent of national income, over the next decade, and millions more U.S. residents are on a path to becoming uninsured or underinsured, absent new policies. We need to change directions, starting with the recognition that access to care, health care quality, and efficiency are interrelated. Aiming higher and moving on a more positive path will require strategies targeting the multiple sources of poor health system performance. These strategies include: universal and well-designed coverage that ensures affordable access and continuity of care, with low administrative costs; incentives aligned to promote higher quality and more efficient care; care that is designed and organized around the patient, not providers or insurers; widespread implementation of health information technology with information exchange; explicit national goals to meet and exceed benchmarks and monitor performance; and national policies that promote private-public collaboration and high performance.4 Rising costs put families, businesses, and public budgets under stress, pulling down living standards for middle- as well as low-income families. New national policies that take a coherent, whole-system, population view are essential for the nation's future health and economic security.15In the first decade of the 21st century, the nation's health care system faces challenges on multiple fronts. The number of uninsured has increased by 8.6 million since 2000, as employer-sponsored coverage continued to erode even during a period of economic expansion. There were 47 million uninsured Americans as of 2006.5 Affordable insurance is of concern to families, employers, and public programs: as health care costs continue to rise far faster than incomes, financial protection and access to care for middle- as well as low-income families are increasingly at risk.6 U.S. health expenditures, already the highest in the world, are projected to double and reach 20 percent of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) by 2017, with even higher shares of GDP going toward health care over the longer term.7 The United States spends the most per person on health care\u2014twice what other major industrialized countries spend\u2014and has had rapid rates of cost growth over the past two decades (Exhibit 3). Evidence continues to mount that the quality of care is uneven and often suboptimal.8 Quality encompasses not only whether patients receive care that is safe and scientifically proven, but also whether physicians communicate well with patients and coordinate care effectively when patients transition from one place to another. Y et, providers' financial incentives typically encourage doing more rather than supporting high-quality, integrated care across settings, episodes, and conditions with more efficient use of resources. T oo often, patients are left to cope with what is, in effect, a fragmented \"non- system\" of care. Reflecting broad public concerns with access, costs, and care experiences, the percentage of patients expressing dissatisfaction with the health care system doubled from 1998 to 2006.9Introduction EXHIBIT 3 * PPP =Purchasing Power Parity.

This failing has serious consequences: poorer health from lack of timely access to care; health conditions that, left unchecked, become costlier to treat; premature death; and reduced economic output from a less productive, sicker workforce.10 Other nations spend less on health care, achieve better health outcomes, and cover their entire populations. This indicates that the U.S. is not getting high value commensurate with its investment in the health care system.11 Developing policies to move the U.S. toward a higher- value health system over time, and evaluating the effects of particular health policies relative to goals, requires a means to monitor health system performance across all of its dimensions. T o meet this need for a whole-system view, the Commonwealth Fund Commission on a High Performance Health System created a National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance in 2006.12 Spanning healthy lives, quality, access, efficiency, and equity, the Scorecard found that U.S. health system performance fell far short of what should be attainable, based on benchmarks of achieved performance, and uncovered broad evidence of opportunities to improve.The National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance, 2008, updates the analysis to assess current performance and changes over time, based on the most recent data available. By contrasting national performance with benchmarks, the Scorecard provides targets for action and a yardstick against which to assess new policies over time. In the sections that follow, we describe how the Scorecard works and present overall findings and results for five core dimensions of health system performance. We conclude with an analysis of cross-cutting themes and implications for national policy and improvement initiatives.17The National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance provides a unique, comprehensive approach to measuring and monitoring the performance of the nation's health care system. The Commonwealth Fund Commission on a High Performance Health System developed the Scorecard to serve three central goals: to provide benchmarks for assessing health system performance; to have a mechanism for monitoring change over time; and to be able to estimate the effects of proposed policies to improve performance. The Scorecard includes key indicators of national health system performance organized into five core dimensions: healthy lives , which includes life expectancy, mortality, and prevalence of disability and limitations due to health; quality , a broad measure covering the extent to which the care delivered is effective and well-coordinated, safe, timely, and patient-centered;access , which is concerned with participation in the health care system and the affordability of insurance coverage and medical services; efficiency , which assesses overuse or inappropriate use of services, preventable hospitalizations and readmissions, regional variation in quality and cost, administrative complexity, and use of information systems; andequity , which looks at disparities among population groups in terms of health status, care, and coverage. The 2008 Scorecard uses the same framework, methods, and set of 37 performance indicators included in the first Scorecard published in 2006. The analysis assesses current performance as well as changes over time. For each indicator, the Scorecard compares national performance against benchmark levels achieved by top- performing groups within the U.S. or other countries. In a few instances, benchmarks reflect targets or policy goals. The report updates the benchmarks whenever top performance improved from baseline values observed in the 2006 report. Each score is a simple ratio of the current U.S. average performance to the benchmark representing best levels of achievement, with a maximum possible score of 100. T o examine trends, we compare the baseline and current national averages as well as the change in the range of performance. Time trends typically capture two years and up to five years for some indicators. Where indicators could not be updated, we retained baseline values to score. The tables in Appendix A present details for all indicators. (See box for further information on methodology.) An extensive Scorecard Chartpack is available online at www.commonwealthfund.org. Future editions of the Scorecard will continue to monitor trends and add or improve indicators as new data become available.The Scorecard: Measuring and Monitoring Health System Performance sCoreC ard meT hodology The National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance, 2008, includes a set of 37 core indicators that builds on metrics developed by public and private quality improvement efforts, as well as several unique indicators created for the Scorecard that are not currently tracked elsewhere. The 2008 Scorecard uses the same set of indicators used in the 2006 Scorecard, with one exception reflecting a change in the data source: a general measure of mental health care was replaced by a more specific measure of treatment of a major depressive episode. Many of the indicators are composites that summarize performance across multiple measures. Of the underlying 61 data elements, 53 were updated. Almost all updates spanned at least two years; more than one-third assessed change over three to five years. For each indicator, we present national data for the baseline used in the 2006 Scorecard and most recent year. Scoring consists of a simple ratio that compares national performance to the benchmark, with a maximum score of 100. For each indicator, we identified benchmarks based on rates achieved by the top 10 percent of U.S. states, regions, hospitals, health plans, or other providers or top countries. where patient data were available only at the national level, we identified benchmarks based on the experiences of high-income, insured individuals. Four access benchmarks aim for logical policy goals, such as 100 percent of the population to be adequately insured. For one quality indicator\u2014adults getting all recommended preventive care\u2014we set a target rate of 80 percent, since rates even among high-income, insured populations were low. we updated benchmarks whenever they improved. Thus, it is possible for scores to decline if benchmarks improve faster than the national average. For costs, we used the most recent data on the lowest-cost groups as benchmarks. For patient-reported experiences in hospitals, we used the newly available broad sample to benchmark, rather than the pilot set in the first Scorecard. For infant mortality, we switched the benchmark from countries to top U.S. states to ensure comparable indicator methods. To score, we calculated ratios of average rates to the benchmark. where higher rates would indicate a move in a positive direction, we divided the national average by the benchmark. where lower rates would indicate a positive direction (e.g., mortality, medical errors), we divided the benchmark by the national average. where updated data were not available, we retained baseline scores. To summarize, we averaged ratios within dimension and averaged dimensions for an overall score. For equity, we compared the percentage of the group at risk (e.g., percent not receiving recommended care, percent uninsured) by insurance, income, and race/ ethnicity on a subset of indicators. we also included a few specific indicators of health care equity to highlight areas of concern. The risk ratios compare rates for insured relative to uninsured; high income to low income; and whites to blacks and Hispanics. we recalculated baseline scores when necessary due to data revisions. As a result, the overall baseline score changed from 66 to 67 for the 2006 Scorecard. See Appendices A and B for scoring tables and details regarding indicator data, years, and sources.18OVERALL SCORES AND TRENDS: 2008 SCORECARD COMPARED WITH 2006 SCORECARD Overall, the National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance, 2008, finds that the U.S. health system continues to perform far below benchmarks of what is achievable, with wide gaps between average and benchmark performance persisting across dimensions. The health system as a whole scores only 65 in 2008\u201435 percent below the benchmarks of best performance. Average dimension scores ranged from a low of 53 for efficiency to 72 for healthy lives (Exhibit 1). The overall score for U.S. health system performance failed to improve from the 2006 to the 2008 Scorecard. Access to care significantly declined due to continuing erosion in health insurance coverage and affordability. Across the 37 core indicators, performance scores more often worsened than improved, primarily because of declines in national rates. Among the 37 indicator scores, 41 percent of scores declined, about a third (35%) improved, and the rest exhibited no change (or were not updated). Looking at underlying national averages for all indicators, nearly half showed little or no change, and about as many declined as improved between the 2006 and 2008 Scorecard (see Appendix A T able 1).13 Performance remains uneven within U.S. borders\u2014 with up to fivefold variation (twofold variation on average) between the top- and bottom-tier states, health care facilities, or health plans (see Appendix A). Moreover, the range of performance within the U.S. more often widened than narrowed from the 2006 to 2008 Scorecard. Equity gaps also persisted between advantaged and disadvantaged groups. On key indicators, the bottom of the performance range would have to improve by 40 percent on average simply to reach current national rates of performance, which are often only mediocre. Although there are encouraging pockets of improvement, the U.S. still has a long way to go to make its health system the best possible. The country as a whole is often failing to keep pace with levels of performance attained by leading nations, states, and delivery systems, and consistently ranks poorly in comparison with other countries on measures of healthy lives, care experiences, and efficiency. The following sections summarize findings of the 2008 Scorecard, highlighting individual indicators and changes in performance since the 2006 Scorecard. HEALTHY LIVES oVerView Compared with top-performing countries and states, the U.S. as a whole is falling short in promoting healthy, long, and productive lives for everyone. The Scorecard includes five indicators in this dimension, including potentially preventable deaths, infant mortality, disability, and healthy life expectancy. From 2006 to 2008, average performance declined from 75 to 72, due to poor performance on two core indicators. The score reflects the growing gaps in health outcomes between average and top performance, particularly as the U.S. lags behind gains achieved by leading countries. Appendix A T able 2 presents the national rate, range of performance, and scores for indicators in this dimension. Pre Ven TaB le mor Tali Ty The U.S. fell into last place among 19 industrialized countries on national rates of mortality considered \"amenable to health care. \"14 These are deaths before age 75 caused by at least partially preventable or treatable conditions, such as bacterial infections, screenable cancers, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and complications of common surgical procedures. While the U.S. rate improved 4 percent between 1997-1998 and 2002-2003 (from 115 to 110 deaths per 100,000), rates improved by 16 percent on average in the other countries (Exhibit 4). In fact, countries that began with considerably higher premature mortality rates than the U.S., including the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Portugal, now outperform the U.S. in preventing or delaying such deaths. At the same time, the top three countries (France, Japan, and Australia) have raised the bar of performance. As a result, U.S. death rates are now 59 percent higher than in countries with the lowest rates. Improving U.S. mortality from amenable Findings from the 2008 National Scorecard19causes to levels achieved by these leading countries would translate into 101,000 fewer deaths per year. The rate of infants born in the U.S. who die before their first birthday improved slightly from 2002 to 2004 (from 7.0 to 6.8 deaths per 1,000 live births), thus returning to earlier levels. Y et, the U.S. average remains well above rates in the lowest states and countries. Rates of infant mortality in the worst-performing states are more than twice those in benchmark states. Of concern, the gap between the leading and lagging states grew wider in 2004, as states with the highest rates\u2014primarily poor and located in the South\u2014experienced an increase in infant mortality.15 Moreover, the U.S. ranked last among eight industrialized countries that report infant mortality using the same methodology, with a national rate more than double the leading countries (2.8 to 3.1 deaths per 1,000 live births in Japan, Iceland, and Sweden in 2004).16 im PaCT s o F P oor heal Th Healthy life expectancy . Reflecting these mortality trends, life expectancy in the U.S. has not kept pace with other advanced countries, even as it reached a new high of almost 78 years in 2006.17 The U.S. ranks poorly in terms of healthy life expectancy at age 60, as U.S. adults spend more of their lives in poor health than adults in other countries. Perhaps this is not surprising, given the greater burden of chronic health problems among older adults in the U.S., compared with adults abroad, and the adverse health consequences for older adults after long periods without insurance.18 Activity limitations. More than one of every six working-age adults (18%) reported being unable to work or carry out everyday activities because of health problems in 2006\u2014up from 15 percent reporting limitations in 2004. Health-related limitations increased in both the top and bottom five states, but the deterioration was greatest in the bottom states. Previously reported rates at which children miss large numbers of school days because of illnesses or injuries vary more than twofold across states. These findings indicate the need for better prevention and treatment of chronic diseases to enhance quality of life and capacity to work, particularly among younger cohorts as they age.HEAL THY LIVES EXHIBIT 4 Mortality Amenable to Health Care France050100150 AustraliaItaly Norway Sweden AustriaDenmark rates before age /seven.k/five.k; includes ischemic heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and bacterial infections.

Source: Commonwealth Fund National Scorecard on U.S. Health System is much room for improvement on the nation's ability to promote health and well-being and much to gain from cultivating a healthy and productive workforce. The U.S. is unlikely to move forward on this central goal unless the health system's shortcomings in terms of health care access, quality, and efficiency are addressed simultaneously. QUALITY OF CARE oVerView The nation is not making consistent progress in improving the quality of health care based on Scorecard indicators that track the extent to which patients receive care that is effective, safe, well-coordinated, timely, and patient- centered. Although national average performance improved for several indicators of effective care, in particular control of chronic disease and care in the hospital, there was no improvement in overall receipt of adult preventive care. Performance was uneven, slipped, or did not keep pace with benchmarks of safe, well-coordinated, and patient- centered care. As a result, the average of these key areas comprising quality failed to improve, yielding an overall score of 71\u2014an average of 29 percent below benchmark performance.19 Appendix A T ables 3 and 4 present the national rate, range of performance, and scores for each indicator in this dimension. eFFeCT iVe Care Across five indicators measuring whether Americans receive services that are effective and appropriate for preventing or treating a given condition and controlling chronic illness, the average score increased from 74 to 78. Two indicators showed substantial progress in narrowing the gap between average and benchmark performance, while three exhibited no or little improvement. Preventive care. Only half of adults received all age- appropriate preventive care such as immunizations, cancer screenings, and blood pressure and cholesterol tests in 2005, with no improvement since 2002 (Exhibit 5). Achieving the Scorecard's benchmark target of 80 percent would mean that 70 million more adults would receive all recommended preventive care. Multifaceted interventions, including organizational changes, are needed to make delivery of preventive services a routine part of patient care.20 The proportion of young children who received all recommended doses of five key vaccines increased slightly, from 79 percent in 2003 to 81 percent in 2006, although QUALITY: EFFECTIVE CARE EXHIBIT 5 * Recommended care includes seven key screening and preventive services: blood pressure, cholesterol, Pap, mammogram, fecal occult blood test or sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy, and /f_lu shot.

This area of relatively better performance demonstrates the value of population health improvement policies, such as school vaccination requirements, coupled with a commitment to measuring and improving rates at national, state, and community levels. Mental health care . Among adults who had major depressive episodes, rates of those receiving at least some treatment increased marginally, from 65 to 69 percent from 2004 to 2006, leaving nearly one-third without any care. (A measure of mental health care for children could not be updated.) Further pointing to gaps in mental health care, research finds that mental health treatment is often inadequate, even among those who do receive it.21 Improving depression care would not only improve quality of life for individuals, it would also increase workplace productivity by an estimated $2.2 billion annually.22 Chronic disease management. According to the results of physical exams conducted on a nationally representative sample, rates of control of two common chronic conditions, diabetes and hypertension, have improved (Exhibit 6). Among adults with diabetes, rates of at least fair control of blood sugar (hemoglobin A1c less than 9%) increased from 79 percent to 88 percent from 1999-2000 to 2003-2004. Many diabetics need to lower their blood sugar levels further to achieve good control (hemoglobin A1c less than 7%), which just more than half (56%) have achieved. Control of high blood pressure increased from 31 percent to 41 percent of adults with hypertension\u2014a risk factor for heart disease and stroke\u2014during the same time period. Further improvement could help prevent or delay serious disease complications. Achieving the level of control seen in the best-performing health plans could prevent up to 39,000 premature deaths and save up to $2 billion in medical costs annually.23 Rates of control of these two common conditions vary widely across health plans, with a 30 to 60 percentage point spread between top- and bottom-performing plans. Moreover, national rates of control vary significantly depending on whether adults have insurance. Uncontrolled diabetes rates (HbA1c 9% or higher) were 37 percent among the uninsured, compared with 19 percent among QUALITY: EFFECTIVE CARE EXHIBIT 6 Data: J. M.

Among adults with hypertension, 79 percent of uninsured adults had blood pressure levels that were not under control, compared with 59 percent of the insured (see Scorecard Chartpack). Hospital care for common conditions. Hospitals delivered 10 evidence-based treatments 90 percent of the time to patients with heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia in 2006\u2014up from 84 percent in 2004 (Exhibit 7). Although the entire distribution moved up, the spread between the bottom and top 10th percentiles of hospitals remained wide, particularly for pneumonia and heart failure, for which there were gaps of 20 to 30 percentage points, respectively, between leading and lagging hospitals. The positive general trend on hospital quality indicators reflects the influence of national consensus on a single set of measures, widespread hospital data reporting following linkage to Medicare payment updates, and public reporting of hospital-specific results on the federal Hospital Compare Web site.24 This initiative changed the landscape for hospital acceptance and reporting of quality performance and sparked broad efforts to improve. T op hospitals are achieving 100 percent on these basic process measures, indicating that full adherence to guidelines is possible. Researchers estimate that if hospitals in the bottom quartile of performance improved to the level of the top quartile, more than 2,000 deaths could be avoided each year.25 Coordina Ted Care Poor care coordination continues to be pervasive in the U.S., owing to a fragmented delivery system and lack of incentives for integration. The average score across five indicators of care coordination slipped from 72 to 71, with only one indicator improving. Better coordination of patient care throughout the course of treatment and across sites of care would help ensure appropriate treatment and follow-up, minimize the risk of error, and prevent complications leading to costly emergency department QUALITY: EFFECTIVE CARE EXHIBIT 7 * Composite for heart a/t_tack care consists of /five.k indicators; heart failure care, /two.k indicators; and pneumonia care, /three.k indicators.

There are additional benefits to patients, including reduced stress and confusion surrounding their treatment and time saved in navigating a complex health system. Regular source of primary care. Connection to a source of primary care can facilitate care coordination as well as provide preventive care and chronic care management. Y et in 2005, more than one-third (35%) of nonelderly adults reported they did not have an easily accessible primary care provider that acts as a central source of care and referrals; the rate was the same in 2002.26 Those who lack a usual source of primary care are more likely to have unmet health care needs, to be hospitalized, and to have higher costs of care and are less likely to keep doctors' appointments, adhere to treatment, and receive preventive care.27 Having health insurance is a key factor for ensuring access to primary care: individuals who are insured all year have a primary care connection at twice the rate of those who are uninsured. Coordination of care for hospital patients. Coordi -nation of care at the time of hospital discharge helps prevent subsequent complications and readmissions, especially for patients with complex or chronic conditions.28 Proper hospital discharge planning ensures that patients understand what to do when they get home and whom to call if they have questions or concerns, and facilitates arrangements for follow-up care. In 2006, two-thirds (68%) of patients hospitalized with heart failure received complete written instructions at discharge, a significant increase from 50 percent in 2004 (Exhibit 8). Y et, one-third, on average, still left without discharge instructions. Although variation narrowed across hospitals, a nearly threefold difference remained from the top to bottom groups. Disturbingly, only one-third of patients in the worst-performing hospitals received full discharge instructions. Follow-up after a hospitalization for mental illness supports a patient's transition to the community and can help avoid further acute crises. 29 Y et, such follow- up failed to occur in one of every four cases in private QUALITY: COORDINATED CARE EXHIBIT 8 * Discharge instructions must address all of the following: activity level, diet, discharge medications, follow-up appointment, weight monitoring, and what to do if symptoms worsen.

Moreover, the rate declined by 8 percent among Medicare health plans from 2004 to 2006, widening the performance deficit with private plans. Rates of follow-up care among patients with mental illness varied fivefold between the best- and worst-performing health plans, and average rates have failed to improve over time. Hospitalization of nursing home residents and home health patients. Nursing homes and home health agencies can limit hospitalization rates by working with hospitals and physicians to coordinate care and by providing high- quality care to avoid complications that require acute care.30 T rends are moving in the wrong direction. Almost one of five long-term nursing home residents (19%) were hospitalized in 2004, up from 17 percent in 2000 (Exhibit 9). Likewise, 18 percent of hospitalized patients who were discharged to a nursing facility were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days in 2004, up from 17 percent in 2000. Rates increased in both low- and high-rate states. Among home health care patients, the national hospitalization rate remained at 28 percent from 2004 to 2006-2007, well above benchmark rates. There is more than a twofold difference in performance between the lowest and highest quartile of agencies (19% to 48%). High rates of unnecessary hospitalizations put frail elders at risk of poor outcomes or complications that often lead to subsequent deteriorations in their conditions. As discussed in recent Medicare Payment Advisory Commission reports, the high rates of potentially avoidable readmissions signal a need to focus on improving the quality of nursing care, discharge planning, and transition care.31 Y et, current payment incentives often work against these goals. In the case of those eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, conflicting payer incentives leave neither program accountable or with incentives to manage care well for frail elderly or disabled residents.32 saF e Care Patient safety risks remain high. National rates across several safety indicators improved, yet they did not keep pace with gains made by benchmark performers. Therefore, the average score among five safety indicators is only 68 out of 100. Nearly one-third (32%) of U.S. patients QUALITY: COORDINATED CARE EXHIBIT 9 Data: V.

It would take a 40 percent reduction to reach the low level of errors reported in the benchmark country (Germany). Drug safety. Drug safety is of particular concern. Among patients living in the community, the rate of adverse drug effects serious enough to require a visit to the doctor or a hospital emergency department increased by one-third from 2001 to 2004. Regional variation widened. Patient injuries may be caused by side effects of the drugs or from human and system failures, such as inadequate patient education, inadequate monitoring of high-risk drugs, and gaps in coordination of care. In 2004, nearly one of five elderly Americans (17%) was prescribed one of the 33 drugs that experts consider potentially inappropriate for the elderly because of limited effectiveness or risk of harm. There was little change in the national rate since 2002. Overuse of antibiotics puts all patients at risk from the threat of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. In 2004, more than one-third (35%) of children prescribed an antibiotic for a sore throat did not receive a \"strep\" test recommended by evidence-based guidelines to determine if they had a bacterial infection warranting antibiotic treatment. This rate improved from 43 percent during the years 1997 to 2003. Variation among health plans reporting to the National Committee for Quality Assurance remains wide, especially among Medicaid plans. Nursing home pressure sores. One of eight high-risk nursing home residents and one of six short-stay residents develop pressure sores, which suggests they are receiving inadequate care. Pressure sores carry the risk of serious complications, including death. The improvements achieved through collaborative initiatives and in individual facilities suggest that it is possible to substantially reduce the incidence of pressure sores.33 Y et, average rates showed no or little improvement from 2004 to 2006 and remained highly variable across states. It would take a 34 percent reduction in national pressure sore rates to reach the level achieved in the top 10 percent of states. Hospital mortality . The hospital standardized mortality ratio (HSMR) is the only safety indicator included in the Scorecard for which there has been broad improvement. Based on Medicare data, this risk-adjusted mortality ratio declined 19 percent, from 101 in 2000-2002 to 82 in 2004-2006 (Exhibit 10).

This improvement followed widespread availability of risk-adjusted measures and several high-profile local and national initiatives that aimed to improve hospital patient safety and reduce mortality by focusing on actionable strategies to track and improve hospital quality. High-profile national initiatives include the Joint Commission National Patient Safety Goals, The Institute for Healthcare Improvement's 100,000 Lives and 5 Million Lives Campaigns,35 The Leapfrog Group's Hospital Quality and Safety Survey, the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, 36 and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network, and others. Eight years after the Institute of Medicine issued its national call to action on patient safety, the federal government is finally moving to establish Patient Safety Organizations with the capacity to collect, analyze, and report on safety events at the national level. In a recent survey, physicians said they are willing to share their experiences with medical errors for learning purposes, but they find the current error reporting systems inadequate. Studies conclude that health care institutions need to do more to engage physicians in meaningful reporting leading to demonstrable improvement at the local level.37 Collaborative efforts to bring down infection rates in intensive care units have shown that following simple \"checklists\" or \"bundles\" of evidence-based practices can reduce rates to zero\u2014setting new benchmarks for performance.38 This level of perfection is being achieved by the top 10 percent to 25 percent of intensive care units participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network, a federal benchmarking initiative (see Scorecard Chartpack ). Wider adoption of these initiatives, coupled with Medicare's new policy of refusing to pay for certain preventable errors, may accelerate improvements in hospital patient safety. PaTien T-Cen Tered and Timely Care Patient-centered care and timely access to care can increase adherence to treatment plans, help engage patients in care decisions, and improve outcomes of care.39 The overall score for patient-centered and timely care declined from 72 to 69, as two indicators declined (one could not be updated). The Scorecard results indicate that there are major deficiencies in providing timely care and communicating effectively with patients. National scores on indicators are as much as 65 percent below benchmarks set by leading countries, health plans, or hospitals. Rapid access to primary care. U.S. adults with health problems are significantly less likely than patients in five of the seven countries surveyed to get a rapid appointment with a physician\u2014the same or the next day\u2014when they are sick. Only 46 percent of patients reported having such rapid access in 2007, nearly the same as in 2005. The failure to improve highlights the slow pace of adoption of advanced access models of care in physician practices and clinics. The U.S. rate would need to improve by more than 75 percent to reach the benchmark rate (81%). After-hours care. U.S. adults with health problems are also the most likely among adults in seven countries surveyed to report difficulty obtaining health care after hours without going to the emergency department. This rate increased from 61 percent to 73 percent from 2005 to 2007 (Exhibit 11). Studies in the U.S. indicate that improved after-hours care and better access to primary care can reduce the need for relatively costly emergency department visits, particularly among higher-risk, low-income patients.40 Physician communication. Open and clear communication between doctors and their patients is a key component of patient-centered care. On average, just over half of U.S. patients in 2004 and 2002 (57% and 54%) said their doctors always listened carefully, explained things clearly, showed them respect, and spent enough time with them. Patient communication experiences vary widely by insurance status and source of coverage. The national rate in 2004 remained well below the 75 percent benchmark rate set by top-performing health plans. Interventions aimed at both physicians and patients may improve the quality of interpersonal medical interactions.41 Hospital responsiveness to patients . A wide range in performance persisted among hospitals on three indicators of patient-centered hospital care, with a 15-to- 24-percentage-point difference between the top decile of hospitals (rates of 66% to 75%) and the bottom decile (rates of 48% to 60%) on measures of how well staff manage pain, respond when patients press a call button or need help going to the bathroom, or explain medications and 27QUALITY: PATIENT-CENTERED, TIMELY CARE EXHIBIT 11 Data: /two.k/zero.k/zero.k/five.k and /two.k/zero.k/zero.k/seven.k Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey.

The best hospitals achieved very high rates of patients giving top ratings on these questions, illustrating that it is possible for hospitals to do much better in meeting patients' needs. These results from 2,500 hospitals participating in the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) Survey are remarkably similar to findings from a smaller pilot of the survey reported in the first National Scorecard. The public release of these data on the Medicare Web site in March 2008 marks a turning point\u2014the first time that consumers have been able to compare hospital performance on a uniform patient survey. It also shows the positive role government can play in promoting greater accountability by sponsoring the development of a standard survey and influencing providers to participate through Medicare payment incentives. HEALTH CARE ACCESS oVerView Access to care is fundamental to high-quality care. Inadequate access can result in inefficient care from avoidable complications, reliance on emergency departments for primary care, duplication of services, and failure to follow-up on test results or preventive care. Rising numbers of uninsured as well as escalating health care costs and health insurance premiums create barriers to care and place financial strain on insured as well as uninsured patients.42 Reflecting these trends, performance on four of five access indicators declined substantially, as increasing numbers of middle- as well as low-income families found themselves at risk of inadequate access to care. The overall score on this dimension dropped from 67 to 58\u2014further from the goal of full participation and affordable access.43 Appendix A T able 5 presents the national rate, range of performance, and scores for each indicator in this dimension. Par TiCiPaTion T o date, most of the erosion in insurance coverage has occurred among working-age adults. Based on annual census data, from 1999-2000 to 2005-2006 the number of states where 23 percent or more of the working-age adult population is uninsured grew from two to nine, while the number of states with less than 14 percent uninsured declined from 22 to eight (Exhibit 13). Children fared better due to public coverage expansions.

And in twelve states, fewer than 7% of children were uninsured.44 As the number of adults without insurance has steadily grown, so has the number of \"underinsured\"\u2014those who are insured all year but have medical bills or deductibles that were high relative to their incomes.45 In 2007, 25 million adults (14%) were underinsured, an increase of more than 60 percent since 2003 when 16 million were underinsured. This sharp jump was driven by a near tripling in the rate (from 4% to 11%) among those with moderate or higher incomes (200% of the federal poverty level or more). Another 50 million adults were uninsured during the year. As a result, as of 2007, more than 75 million adults\u201442 percent of all adults ages 19 to 64\u2014were either uninsured during the year or underinsured, up from 35 percent in 2003 (Exhibit 14). Although low-income adults remain most at risk, the increase in the percent uninsured or underinsured was greatest among those with incomes of 200 percent of poverty or higher. The erosion in coverage undermines access to care. In 2007, more than one-third of U.S. adults (37%) went without needed care, including prescription drugs, because of costs. In contrast, only 5 percent of adults in the Netherlands, the benchmark country, reported such financial barriers to care. The Netherlands has universal coverage with a broad range of benefits and modest cost- sharing by U.S. standards. aFF ordaB le Care The costs of both health insurance and medical care have become less affordable. The average cost of family coverage obtained at employer group rates exceeded $12,000 a year in 2007.46 With premiums rising faster than wages, the average cost of insurance premiums relative to income increased in almost all states. As a result, the percent of adults residing in a state where employer premiums averaged less than 15 percent of the median household income declined precipitously, from 58 percent to 25 percent over the most recent two years. By 2005, nearly one of four adults under age 65 (23%) lived in families with high out-of-pocket health care costs, including premiums and direct spending for services, up from 19 percent in 2001. This increase was driven entirely by rising costs among those with private insurance. Financial burdens were especially steep among people who purchased insurance in the nongroup market: ACCESS: PARTICIPATION EXHIBIT 14 * Underinsured de/f_ined as insured all year but experienced one of the following: medical expenses equaled /one.k/zero.k/u0025.k or more of income; medical expenses equaled /five.k/u0025.k or more of income if low income (</two.k/zero.k/zero.k/u0025.k of poverty); or deductibles equaled /five.k/u0025.k or more of income.

Efforts to moderate premium growth have led to limits on benefits and higher cost-sharing. The resulting exposure to costs added to the share of families who struggle with medical debt and medical bills. By 2007, two of five U.S. adults (41%) reported having problems paying medical bills, being contacted by collection agencies, or paying medical debt over time, up from 34 percent in 2005 (Exhibit 15). Having insurance is no longer a guarantee of financial protection: one of three (33%) adults ages 19 to 64 who were continually insured faced medical bill problems; middle- and lower-income adults were the most at risk. aCC ess and i Ts rela Tionshi P To Q uali Ty and e FFiCien Cy Reduced access to care has serious implications for overall health system performance. Without adequate coverage and financial protection, there is diminished opportunity to receive high-quality care.47 Uninsured people often fail to get timely and appropriate care when needed, leading to worse health outcomes and more costly emergency or acute care later on. When they do get care, the uninsured also experience more medical errors or coordination problems, such as delays in transferring medical records/test results and duplication of tests. A recent study estimates the death toll from being uninsured amounted to 137,000 from 2000 to 2006, including 22,000 deaths in 2006.48 Studies also find that high uninsured rates undermine the quality of care for entire communities and states.49 States and communities in which large shares of the population are uninsured exhibit lower quality and worse patient care experiences across a range of care settings for insured as well as uninsured patients, compared with communities with low rates of uninsured residents.

Ensuring universal access to care can provide a foundation to improve quality and achieve more efficient care over time.50 EFFICIENCY OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM oVerView An efficient care system seeks to maximize health outcomes and quality for the resources spent and to enhance value over time. Lack of access, poorly coordinated or fragmented care, and ineffective care add cost and decrease value. They also waste patients' time. Comparisons with other countries as well as regional variations in cost and quality within the U.S. across an array of efficiency indicators all point to opportunities to achieve savings and/or improve value. Overall, performance on indicators of efficiency remains especially low, with the U.S. average score of just 53 basically unchanged from 52 in the 2006 Scorecard. The failure to improve makes efficiency the dimension with the greatest gap between U.S. performance and achievable benchmarks. Appendix A T able 6 presents the national rate, range of performance, and scores for each indicator in this dimension.ina PPro Pria Te, was TeFul , or F ragmen Ted C are In the U.S., payment incentives can encourage physicians and hospitals to \"do more,\" even though this may mean that patients receive services of marginal or no value.51 An example of this is the use of imaging tests for lower back pain within 28 days of onset, when the patient has no apparent risk factors or sign of serious pathology. Within managed care plans, average rates for this indicator of potentially inappropriate testing are 50 percent higher than rates achieved by benchmark health plans, with little or no change from 2004 to 2006. Health plans have recently been stepping up efforts to review and reduce the use of advanced imaging services in response to their rapid proliferation.52 In a cross-national survey, 22 percent of U.S. adults with health problems reported that test results and medical records were not available at the time of their medical appointment in 2007, compared with the benchmark of 9 percent in the Netherlands (Exhibit 16). U.S. patients were five times more likely to say that doctors unnecessarily repeated tests, as compared with patients in the benchmark country (20% in the U.S. vs. 4% in the Netherlands). There was little change in these indicators from 2005 to 2007. Better performance in the benchmark country likely reflects more integrated care and widespread use of electronic medical records.

One of five U.S. adults (21%) reported they went to the ED for a condition that could have been treated by their regular doctor, more than three times the rate in the benchmark country, Germany, where only 6 percent of patients reported such unnecessary ED use. Ready access to high-quality, well-coordinated primary care can prevent complications and hospitalizations. Rates of potentially preventable hospitalizations for ambulatory care-sensitive (ACS) conditions vary by a multiple of two to four across states and hospital referral regions, with associated variations in costs. The national hospital admission rate for heart failure decreased 4 percent from 2002 to 2004, while the rate for pediatric asthma decreased 13 percent from 2003 to 2004; however, diabetes-related admissions remained unchanged. Among Medicare beneficiaries, a composite rate of hospital admissions for 11 ACS conditions decreased 9 percent from 2003 to 2005, with decreases in both the top and bottom of the distribution. Further reducing Medicare ACS admissions to benchmark levels would save $4 billion annually; savings would be commensurate in the under-65 population. Nearly one of five Medicare patients (18%) initially hospitalized with one of a set of selected conditions was readmitted to the hospital within 30 days; there was no change in this rate from 2003 to 2005 (Exhibit 17).53 Medicare 30-day readmission rates vary widely across hospital referral regions: rates in the highest-rate regions are 50 percent higher than in the lowest-rate regions. Good care provided during a hospital stay and appropriate discharge planning, follow-up, and post-acute care can help prevent patients from being readmitted to the hospital, thus reducing the total costs of care.54 A Medicare Payment Advisory Commission analysis indicates that up to three-quarters of readmissions may be preventable with better primary care, transition care, and reduced complications from care received while hospitalized\u2014a potential savings of $12 billion a year for Medicare. 55 Varia Tion in Q uali Ty and C os Ts In the Medicare program, the costs of care are highly concentrated among patients with multiple chronic conditions, and such costs are increasing. 56 In 2005, annual costs of care to Medicare averaged $38,000 for patients who had all three of the following conditions: EFFICIENCY EXHIBIT 17 * See Appendix B for list of conditions used in the analysis.

This represents a 20 percent increase from 2001. Costs of care vary significantly across the country, with a twofold spread between the lowest and highest 10th percentiles of hospital regions for any combination of these three conditions (see Appendix A T able 6). Focusing on these patients offers opportunities to improve care outcomes and use resources more efficiently. Updated analysis of regional variations for hospitalized Medicare patients shows that some regions of the country achieve better outcomes than other regions, and at lower cost, through more efficient systems.57 Medicare data for patients hospitalized in 2004 for heart attacks, hip fracture, or colon cancer were used to rank hospital referral regions in terms of their care outcomes and relative resource use (Exhibit 18). Comparing the best- and worst-performing 10th percentiles, one-year mortality rates on this composite indicator of three conditions ranged from 27 percent to 33 percent between the best- and worst-performing regions, while risk-adjusted annual costs ranged from $25,000 to $30,000. Plotting mortality and costs for all regions shows that a high proportion of those regions with the lowest one-year mortality rates also had lower total resource costs over the course of the year. In all, Medicare could save more than 9,000 lives and reduce annual costs by nearly $1 billion a year for these three conditions alone, if all other U.S. regions could achieve the performance levels of the benchmark regions. insuran Ce adminis Tra TiVe C os Ts Private health insurance in the U.S. is characterized by complex benefit and cost-sharing designs and high rates of turnover in plan enrollment. Health plans also incur significant marketing and underwriting costs. Administrative costs have been increasing rapidly in the U.S.: from 2000 to 2006, per capita administrative costs increased 68 percent, from $289 to $485 per person, versus a 47 percent increase in national health expenditures per capita. 58 As a result, insurance administrative costs as a share of total national health expenditures are more than three times higher in the U.S. than in countries with the lowest rates (Finland, Japan, and Australia) and 30 percent to 70 percent higher than in three countries where private insurance plays a substantial role (Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands) (Exhibit 19).

Although use of electronic medical records (EMRs) by U.S. physicians increased from 17 percent to 28 percent from 2001 to 2006, the U.S. lags well behind leading countries that have made a system-wide commitment to invest in interoperable information technology (Exhibit 20). In the United Kingdom, nine of 10 primary care practices have EMRs, as do 98 percent of practices in the Netherlands. Further, clinical data systems in these countries are more likely than those in the U.S. to have advanced functions to provide decision support and enable information to flow with patients across sites of care. At the current U.S. rate of dispersion, it would require more than 30 years to expand such tools to all physicians. EQUITY IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM oVerView The health care system offers the potential to provide equal opportunities for all to lead healthy and productive lives, a core founding value of the United States. However, studies repeatedly reveal pervasive disparities in health outcomes and care experiences across different racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups within the U.S. Reducing and eliminating such disparities has long been a major national concern and is central to improving care for the country as a whole. Y et, the Scorecard finds persistent and wide gaps on key indicators across dimensions between vulnerable populations and their benchmark reference groups, with no improvement since the 2006 baseline\u2014the average score was 71 in 2008 compared with 70 in the 2006 Scorecard. As illustrated in Exhibit 21, wide inequities persist for each vulnerable group in healthy lives, access, quality, and efficiency. insured Compared with uninsuredhigh income Compared with low income^white Compared with Blackwhite Compared with hispanic 2006 2008 2006 2008 2006 2008 2006 2008 eQuiTy aVerage sCore 65 66 61 61 76 75 77 81 (Number of indicators*) (18) (25) (26) (26) dimension aVerages healthy lives NA NA 54 55 77 77 97 97 Quality Eff ective Care 59 57 69 68 80 76 73 70 Safe Care 97 97 94 94 77 77 94 94 Patient-Centered, Timely Care 56 56 59 59 72 62 54 64 Coordinated and effi cient Care 55 58 63 60 61 73 58 72 access 57 61 30 32 86 87 82 87EQUITy EXHIBIT 21 * No updated data available for 4 indicators by insurance, 4 indicators by income, and 4 indicators by race/ethnicity; used baseline score from 2006. ^ Generally income compares either poor/near poor (<200% poverty) to those of incomes of 400% of poverty or higher or compares annual incomes of under $35,000 to incomes above $45,000.

Gaps in performance for uninsured and low-income populations are even wider; it would require a 34 percent to 39 percent improvement on average to achieve parity with insured and high-income populations, respectively. While some gaps are closing, a significant proportion have worsened or stayed the same. Moreover, in some instances, gaps have narrowed only because experiences grew worse for white, insured, or higher-income groups. dis Pari Ties in insuran Ce C on TriBuTe To dis Para Te C are e XP erien Ces Overall, minorities are much less likely than whites to get preventive care or proper treatment when needed; for some indicators, relative disparities are widening. For instance, blacks and Hispanics are less likely to receive treatment for depression than whites, and these rates have worsened at the same time that there has been improvement among whites. Minorities are also at significantly higher risk of having untreated dental caries than whites, and here again minority rates are on the rise, specifically among the elderly (Exhibit 22). Disparities in care experiences in part reflect minorities' lower incomes and insurance gaps. Insured, higher-income populations are generally at lower risk of poor access and care experiences. For example, rates of caries going untreated are more than two times higher among the uninsured than the insured across all ages. Inequitable access to quality health services, especially among the chronically ill, contributes to disparate short- and long-term health outcomes between whites and minorities. The proportion of diabetic blacks and Hispanics with uncontrolled blood sugar is more than two times that of whites, and this disparity has grown as white rates have fallen. Moreover, blacks and Hispanics suffer disproportionately high rates of death and hospitalizations because of diabetes-related complications. There has been only modest improvement in utilization of appropriate diabetes services and exams. For patients, successfully managing a chronic condition requires an ongoing relationship with a primary care office that can provide easy access and organized care.59 As such, EQUITY: EFFECTIVE CARE EXHIBIT 22 Data: Race/ethnicity\u2014National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NCHS /two.k/zero.k/zero.k/seven.k); Total and income\u2014J.

Even greater gaps in care are observed by income and insurance coverage than by race and ethnicity, particularly for indicators of health care access and efficiency. The poor and uninsured are at heightened risk of lacking a regular source of primary care, experiencing medical record or test coordination problems, and facing medical cost burdens. Difficulties with getting timely and coordinated care can lead to poor health outcomes and more costly use of care. Low-income and uninsured patients are more likely than those with higher incomes and insurance to go to an emergency department for care a primary care doctor could have provided. Moreover, rates of hospitalizations for preventable conditions are two to three times higher in low-income communities than in more affluent areas, and gaps are increasing (Exhibit 23). As for health outcomes, individuals with low levels of education (used as a proxy for low socioeconomic status) continue to be at significantly greater risk of death from chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.60 Further, disparities in mortality rates are widening due to an increase among the least educated and substantial reductions among better educated groups.61 Although adequate data are not available to track and measure health outcomes by insurance coverage, a growing body of research documents a strong relationship between being uninsured and mortality.62 Recent studies have shown that, relative to the insured, uninsured cancer patients are more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages and are less likely to survive once a diagnosis is made.63 Inadequate insurance coverage is also a major concern. Both the insured and uninsured are finding it increasingly difficult to pay for their medical care; in fact, more than one-third (35%) of adults who were insured all year went without needed care because of costs, a significant increase since 2005. Moreover, the rate of unpaid medical bills and medical debt has increased among the insured and uninsured alike.

Inequity in care is not just a social concern, but an issue of concern for health system performance. Disparities undermine performance across all dimensions of care\u2014access, quality, and efficiency\u2014and lead to missed opportunities to ensure long, healthy, and productive lives.

SYSTEM CAPACITY TO INNOVATE AND IMPROVE no T s Cored (see scorecard Chartpack for data) The capacity to innovate and improve to achieve excellence is fundamental to a high-performing health care system. It includes: a care system that supports a skilled and motivated health care workforce, with an emphasis on primary care and population health; a culture of quality improvement and continuous learning that promotes and rewards recognition of opportunities to reduce errors and improve outcomes; and investment in public health initiatives, research, and information necessary to inform, guide, and drive health care decision-making and improvement. On all three aspects, the U.S. currently under-invests in the system capacity to improve. heal Th C are wor KFor Ce Countries and areas with more primary care physicians (in proportion to population and to medical specialists) achieve more equitable and better overall outcomes at lower cost.64 Viewed from an international perspective, the U.S. has a relatively weak primary care system.65 Current payment mechanisms undervalue primary care and fail to support the time and teams necessary to manage and coordinate care.66 Notably, earnings of primary care physicians lag well behind those of specialists, even as primary care doctors are expected to do more to promote prevention and care of chronic disease.67 As a result, primary care has become less attractive as a career: the proportion of residents choosing primary care has declined at the same time as the workforce is aging.68 Studies suggest that we need to rethink primary care to enhance the capacity to provide accessible, quality, patient-centered, and coordinated care.69 \"Medical home\" approaches that invest in clinical practice information systems and embed primary care in integrated systems have the potential to improve outcomes, satisfaction, and enable more efficient use of resources. As illustrated by multiple Scorecard indicators, the U.S. needs a renewed emphasis on primary care for the 21st century\u2014including payment systems that support primary care physicians and midlevel practitioners working together on teams\u2014as a foundation for accessible, high-value care. An empowered nursing workforce can positively influence patient and nursing home resident satisfaction and quality of care.70 Job dissatisfaction among nurses contributes to shortages and high staff turnover, which drive up costs and put patients at risk.71 Data compiled for the Scorecard reveal that nursing staff satisfaction is much more variable in nursing homes than in hospitals.72 High-performing institutions offer benchmarks for improvement. A growing body of evidence indicates that higher levels of registered nurse staffing in hospitals and nursing homes is associated with improved quality.73 Case studies indicate that creative use of nurses with redesigned work processes can free up time to spend on patient care. Nurse staffing levels are of particular concern in nursing homes and vary widely across states. Nursing homes in the five states with the highest registered nurse staffing levels provide double the hours per patient day as the national median, and six times more than those in the five states with the lowest average staffing levels.74 organiza Tional CulTure In its 1999 report, T o Err Is Human , the Institute of Medicine called on health care organizations to \"develop a culture of safety such that an organization's design processes and workforce are focused on a clear goal\u2014 dramatic improvement in the reliability and safety of the care process. \"75 T eamwork is a key mechanism for achieving high reliability.76 Creating effective teamwork and a culture of safety are challenging goals for organizations to achieve. A survey completed in 2007 by staff at 519 hospitals reveals 39wide variation between high- and low-scoring hospitals on how well they nurture teamwork and continuous improvement.77 Notably, less than half of hospitals respond effectively to medical or medication errors. Case studies find that organizational leaders can engage their workforce to promote a safety culture through persistent attention and effort.78 Instituting a culture of resident-centered care practices in nursing homes has been shown to improve residents' quality of life, increase staff satisfaction, and reduce staff turnover.79 This approach emphasizes a \"home-like\" environment in which residents make decisions about daily activities and promotes collaborative decision-making and a consistent care team made up of staff members who know residents and their needs. In a 2007 survey of nursing home directors of nursing, almost half expressed a commitment to culture change, but only a minority indicated that their facility was adopting more than a few of these practices.80 Federal officials have expressed support for culture change, but have yet to support the goal with changes in payment policies to enable the approach to become widespread.81na Tional heal Th eXP endi Tures For resear Ch and P uBliC heal Th Building the information infrastructure of the health care system could pay dividends in increased capacity, efficiency, and quality. Necessary elements to transform care systems and support broader population health improvement include interoperable information systems, information on clinical and cost effectiveness, payment incentives aligned with outcomes, and population health activities that can help prevent disease and its complications. However, between 2000 and 2006, national spending on public health activities fell behind, increasing by only 35 percent, as compared with a 55 percent increase in national health expenditures and a 78 percent increase in insurance administrative costs. Likewise, in an era of medical care advances, national investment in research regarding clinical and cost effectiveness\u2014what works well for which patients and when\u2014has failed to keep pace to inform health care decisions. Only about 5 percent of the federal research budget is devoted to health systems improvement research\u2014less than $1 for every $1,000 in national health care spending. This amount is grossly out of proportion to the scope of the nation's health system. Increased funding for comparative medical effectiveness research and improved patient decision-making would more than pay for itself, saving up to an estimated $368 billion over 10 years from more effective and efficient care.8240Overall, the National Scorecard on U.S. Health System Performance, 2008, finds that the United States is losing ground in providing access to care and has uneven health care quality. The Scorecard also finds broad evidence of inefficient and inequitable care. Average U.S. health system performance would have to improve by more than 50 percent on multiple indicators to reach the benchmarks. PoTen Tial For im Pro Vemen T: im F a Chie Ving B en Chmar Ks The Scorecard makes a compelling case for change. Gaps between average performance and benchmarks remain large, underscoring opportunities to save lives, improve health, and reduce spending on ineffective, wasteful care. Achieving benchmark levels of performance, even among a subset of indicators, would yield considerable gains. For example, if the U.S. reduced its mortality rate from causes amenable to health care to international benchmarks, approximately 101,000 deaths could be prevented annually. The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) estimates that improving national rates of controlling hypertension and diabetes to those achieved by the top group of health plans could save 16,000 to 39,000 lives each year.83 Some of the potential improvements may affect the same individuals. Still, these estimates serve as compelling evidence of the human and economic costs of poor performance. In addition to reducing mortality, health performance improvement has the potential to improve quality of life from preventing disease, disability, and complications. Increasing adult preventive care to reach 80 percent of the population translates to about 70 million more adults reaping the benefits of disease prevention and early detection. Likewise, 37 million additional adults would have a regular provider for primary care and specialty referrals. Closing gaps between average performance and achieved benchmarks across quality and access indicators also has the potential to reduce costs. If the nation were able to meet the benchmark levels of health system performance on even a select set of indicators, the nation could save at least $50 billion to $100 billion per year. Opportunities for savings come from improving outcomes and coordination as well as reducing insurance overhead costs and geographic variations in costs. Based on NCQA estimates, controlling diabetes and blood pressure to benchmark levels could yield $1 billion to $2 billion per year in savings through lower medical costs.84 Improving depression care could increase workplace productivity by an estimated $2.2 billion annually. The Medicare program could potentially save at least $12 billion a year by reducing readmissions and reducing hospitalizations for preventable conditions. Over $1 billion could be saved annually by providing better coordination for frail nursing home residents. Further savings are possible by lowering the administrative costs of insurance in the U.S. If these costs were the same average share of health spending as in three European countries that rely on mixed private/ public insurance, the U.S. could save up to $51 billion each year\u2014or more than half the cost to cover the entire uninsured population. Lowering administrative costs to benchmark levels achieved in the best countries could save up to $102 billion. The wide variation in costs points to opportunities for net national gains from the provision of more efficient care. If annual per person costs for Medicare in higher-cost states came down to median rates or those achieved in the lowest-quartile states, the nation would save $22 billion to $38 billion per year.85 Estimated savings from these selected improvements toward more effective, timely, and coordinated care are only a fraction of more than $2 trillion in health spending in 2006. Y et, taken together, they offer targets to reduce costs and improve value. Moreover, the nation would gain from improved productivity. The Institute of Medicine estimates national economic gains of up to $130 billion per year from insuring the uninsured.86 A recent update of this analysis estimated potential savings of up to $204 billion in 2006.87 The Scorecard highlights the need for a multifaceted approach of mutually supporting policies addressing access, quality, and efficiency simultaneously. Starting sooner rather than later has the potential to accumulate into substantial gains over time. A recent study prepared for the Commission on a High Performance Health System Summary and Implications41illustrates that it would be possible to save $1.5 trillion in national health expenditures over 10 years and improve value in terms of access, quality, and outcomes through strategic options including better information, payment changes, and public health improvements, combined with insurance for all.88 In sum, raising levels of performance to benchmarks offers the potential for significant national gains in health and value. Looking across dimensions and trends, the 2008 Scorecard reveals several underlying patterns that have implications for policy. w h a T r e Ce iVe s aT T e n Ti o n ge Ts im Pro Ved Notably, the quality indicators showing significant improvement have all been targets of national and collaborative efforts to improve, informed by data with measurable benchmarks and indicators reached by consensus. These initiatives represent important breakthroughs from the status quo that can and should be emulated in other areas. These positive improvements in performance demonstrate that change can take place rapidly over a relatively short time period when there is leadership and measurement. Hospital quality indicators for heart attack, pneumonia, and heart failure (including provision of discharge instructions) were endorsed by a broad hospital quality alliance. Improvement on these indicators followed after Medicare made payment updates contingent on provision of data and public reporting. Hospital quality metrics have also been the focus of Medicare's Premier Hospital Quality Incentive Demonstration and private payer initiatives. This combination of public-private collaboration and federal leadership changed the landscape on hospital participation in public reporting, establishing a single consensus set of measures that are now well-accepted for benchmarking and improvement. Hospital standardized mortality ratios were the target of many local and national programs and collaborative initiatives that sought to publicize, implement, and spread evidence-based care and best practices to achieve better outcomes. Likewise, chronic disease indicators have been central to NCQA's monitoring of health plan performance through the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS).Conversely, there was failure to improve in areas where we lack metrics or focused efforts to measure, compare, and improve at the local or facility level. These areas include mental health care, primary care, hospital readmission rates, or adverse drug events. Further, the continued failure to adopt health information technology makes it difficult to generate the information necessary to document performance and monitor improvement efforts. BeTT er P rimary C are and C are Coordina Tion hold P oTen Tial For im Pro Ved ou TC omes a T lower C os Ts Hospital readmission rates have increased and admissions for conditions sensitive to ambulatory care remain high and variable across the country, as do the total costs of caring for the chronically ill. Studies indicate that it is possible to prevent hospitalizations or rehospitalizations with better primary care, discharge planning, and follow-up care\u2014a more integrated, \"systems\" approach. Following on a recommendation from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, the federal government recently proposed that readmission rates be included in an expanded set of quality indicators that hospitals would be required to report to receive the full Medicare payment update. 89 Multiple indicators highlight the fact that the U.S. has a weak primary care foundation. Investing in primary care with enhanced capacity to provide patients with round-the-clock access, manage chronic care, and coordinate care will be key strategies to move to more organized care systems.90 However, current payment incentives for hospitals, physicians, and nursing homes do not support coordination of care or efficient use of expensive, specialized care.91 Information also fails to flow with patients across sites of care due to lack of health information technology and information exchange systems. These inefficiencies require the attention of policymakers. aiming higher : T he C ase For a sys Tems aPProa Ch T o C hange In summary, the U.S. health system continues to exhibit suboptimal performance relative to what is achievable and to the resources invested. The 2008 Scorecard documents that there are significant human and economic costs of failing to address the problems in our health system. Recent analysis suggests it could be possible to insure everyone and achieve savings with improved value over 42the next decade.92 It is crucial to recognize that health care access, quality, and efficiency are interrelated. With health care expenditures projected to double to $4 trillion, or 20 percent of national income, and millions more Americans on a path to becoming uninsured or underinsured absent new policies, it is critical to start now on the road to higher performance. Aiming higher will require strategies that address the multiple sources of poor performance. These strategies include: universal and well-designed coverage that ensures affordable access and continuity of care; incentives aligned to promote higher quality and more efficient care; care that is designed and organized around the patient, not providers or insurers; widespread implementation of health information technology with information exchange; explicit goals to meet and exceed benchmarks and monitor performance; and national policies that promote private-public collaboration and high performance.93 As rising costs put family, business, and public budgets under stress, access to care and financial protection are eroding for middle- as well as low-income families. New national policies that take a coherent, whole-system, population view are essential for the nation's future health and economic security.43 1 T.
