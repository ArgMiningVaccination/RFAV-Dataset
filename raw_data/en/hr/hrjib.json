I know how depressing it feels to have horrible skin. When I had acne in my twenties, the first thing I did every morning was to press my skin and see if I had any new spots. I hated seeing myself in the mirror. I felt jealous of my friends who didn't need to wear make-up. It seemed so unfair that other people could have clear skin without even trying. Now, when I work with somebody with acne, I can really relate to what they're going through. And, with over a decade of experience, I know how to help. What is acne? We all know what acne looks like, but I think it's useful to have some definitions. Pus = dead skin cells + sebum + bacteria Pimples = excess sebum + clogged pores -> blackheads and whiteheads Pustules = clogged pores + bacteria -> raised spots with pus Cysts = bacteria in deeper layers of the skin around the hair follicle -> hard, painful lumps Acne = pustules + cysts How does acne happen? - Pores clog with a mixture of dead skin cells and sebum. - As oil collects behind the clogged pore, the bacteria naturally present on the skin multiplies. - The body recognises this as an infection and sends red and white blood cells to fight it, which leads to swelling, redness and inflammation. - Inflammation inside hair follicles causes them to rupture and leads to painful cystic acne. Which bacteria cause acne? - Staphylococcus Aureus. - Propionibacterium Acnes. Resistant strains of these bacteria have been shown to be increasing, and are able to change or adapt to the abnormal oil production and inflammation of acne pores. How do hormones cause acne? Hormonal change during puberty leads to increased androgens (including testosterone) in both boys and girls, which increases oil production in the skin. Acne during puberty affects around 85% of teenagers and often continues into adulthood. Androgen hormones fluctuate naturally during the menstrual cycle which is why pre-menstrual spots are also normal. Acne is worse in those with a genetic predisposition to oilier skin and a tendency to perspire more easily. Stress hormones can worsen acne due to increased perspiration and oil production. The antibiotics cycle Low immunity (which may be caused by antibiotics) affects the gut and increases the tendency to inflammation. In my homeopathy clinic, I often see a history of frequent antibiotic treatment in cases of severe acne. Antibiotics are used to treat many ailments, starting in early childhood, and this has created new strains of antibiotic-resistant superbugs. The medical history usually reveals multiple antibiotic treatments for ear, throat or chest infections during childhood, or perhaps for UTIs in early adulthood. Furthermore, when you have skin breakouts in your teens, the first medical option offered is usually a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment will often clear things up for a short while but can also lead to repeated or longer courses. [[Study: Acne and Group A Strep]](https://grantome.com/grant/NIH/R01-AR051185-03) Many acne sufferers will find that their breakouts don't go away completely, even with antibiotic treatment. The truth is, that antibiotics create more problems than they solve. The long-term impact is on the liver, gut and immune system. There is also an emerging body of research that links acne, gut health and depression. [[Study: Acne, probiotics and the gut-brain-skin-axis]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3038963/) This is why young people find themselves struggling with depression alongside their acne. How I make an initial assessment Homeopathy is a system of medicine that is individualised to the person. When I treat someone with acne I will always ask lots of questions about the acne itself. - Where is the acne located, on the face, neck or body? (some people have it everywhere - as I did) - Is the acne mostly spots, boils, blackheads or cysts? (some people have all of them - as I did) - Are the spots painful? - How long does it take for them to come to a head? - How long does it take to heal after they have discharged? - Do they bleed? - Is the skin oily, combination or dry? - Are the periods regular or irregular? - Does it worsen during certain phases of the period cycle? - How do you feel about it emotionally? I use a system where we give each of the symptoms a number on a scale from 0-5 to evaluate how bad it is. I repeat this checklist at every follow-up session. This helps us both to be objective. I also ask for good photos, without make-up, in natural light to be sent in before each session. When placed side-by-side the progress is always visible. Homeopathy treatment for acne There have been studies into homeopathy for acne, which showed significant improvements in the majority of cases. [[Significant improvements in acne after treatment with homeopathy.]](https://www.oatext.com/Significant-improvements-of-acne-after-treatment-with-homeopathic-medicines.php#gsc.tab=0) [[Case reports of acne and homeopathy.]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29490312/) The studies list the remedies that were used, but there are many homeopathic remedies for acne, and I select the most relevant ones for each person individually. Homeopathic remedies will often change from month to month, to ensure continued progress. Remedies I use regularly include: - Nux Vomica (a liver detox remedy) - Sepia (a hormonal detox remedy) - Thuja (excess oil) - Silicea (pus and cysts) - Kali Brom (purple or blue-toned acne) - Pulsatilla (acne at puberty) This list is just an indication of the different remedies I use. (I don't recommend you try remedies without professional guidance.) My approach also includes organic herbal blends for detoxification and to improve mineral absorption. Herbs containing Berberine are especially valuable. Berberine is a natural compound found in a number of medicinal herbs including Golden Seal, Barberry and Oregon Grape. Homeobotanical remedies containing Berberine are very helpful with detoxifying and clearing pustular skin eruptions such as acne. I also recommend a good quality Zinc supplement to help reduce inflammation.

FAQ 1. How long does it take to clear skin with homeopathy? This depends on a number of factors. - How long you've had acne. - History of medication (both prescribed and over-the-counter). - Whether there is also a diagnosis of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Most people who come to see me for acne treatment have either tried every medication already or want to avoid medication completely. Example with teenage acne In a teenager, with only a few short courses of antibiotics in the medical history, and no hormonal issues, this could be a fairly straightforward case. I would expect there to be significant improvement within six months of homeopathy treatment, along with improvements in skin care and diet. The skin could take around a year or more to fully clear. Example with acne and gut issues If the acne has been treated with many courses of antibiotics, or there were a lot of antibiotics during childhood then there needs to be liver detox and gut repair. I would expect there to be improvements from the start, but it would take around a year for the skin to fully clear. Example with acne, hormones and gut issues If there's a history of the contraceptive pill or other hormones, there needs to be detoxification and hormone balancing. Again, I expect some improvements from the beginning, but this can also take a year or more, depending on how many years of the pill and whether there have also been antibiotics. Tracking the period cycle will be an important part of the process as acne will likely persist until there is a healthy monthly period cycle. Example with Accutane If the acne has been treated with Accutane, then there needs to be an extended period of gentle detox, especially if there have also been antibiotics, which there likely will have been, as Accutane is a 'last resort' medication. There is often some residual depression after Accutane treatment, and I find that homeopathy is helpful in restoring more optimism and balance. FAQ 2. How many sessions will I need? The first appointment is a thorough assessment with a full medical history and a review of any blood test results. After that, we have follow-up sessions every 6 weeks. Regular treatments are essential to ensure steady progress. Because I ask for photos and we evaluate every symptom, you will know you are making progress. FAQ 3. Can I really have clear skin? If you are reading this I know you will have already tried different ways to clear your acne already. You don't expect anything to change your skin overnight, but you are still wishing it would. I understand. I want to give you hope, but I also want to ask you to have realistic expectations. Homeopathy treatment for acne is a journey, and it will take time and commitment. Even severe and long-term acne can fully heal with natural treatment if you're willing to persevere and make changes to your diet and lifestyle. Clear skin is absolutely possible for everyone. Once the skin clears we can work on the scarring, which may not disappear completely but can definitely fade so it is barely noticeable. What I can't do is offer a quick fix or wave a magic wand.
