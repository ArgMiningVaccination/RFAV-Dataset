The pandemic of 2020 created an unprecedented opportunity for biotech and pharmaceutical companies to \"save\" the world. To create, test, make and distribute a vaccine in less than 12 months (even 5 years) is an amazing feat of science, engineering and logistics. Many of these vaccine candidates are themselves novel and their long-term efficacy, side-effects and safety profile are unknown and theoretical. Vaccine manufacturers were given a tax-payer funded opportunity (over $18 billion) to do accelerated research and human trials with fewer restrictions and looser regulations. This great experiment is still ongoing. >>Keep in mind that inoculation (vaccination) was originally investigated and developed at a time when scientific understanding was limited, nutrition and hygiene were poor and medical treatments were marginally effective for transmissible diseases that have (or had) a \"high\" rate of disabiltiy and death (often from secondary complications). >>Reported case fatality rates for small pox (variola major) are around 30%, for Ebola median about 50%, for MERS possibly 35%, for measles historically about 15% (now 0.2%), for the 1918 Spanish flu (with an estimated one-third of world infected) possibly 2.5%, for annual seasonal influenza around 0.1% and for SARS-CoV2 less than 1% (the median about 0.27% by Stanford Ioannidis or 3x that of influenza by Lancet). See our April and other Corona update pages for links to discussions about COVID-19 estimates. There are many web pages promoting the benefits of vaccinations. This page includes open discussion about public health and serious vaccine concerns, with emphasis on those related to events of 2020. Although I am not a virologist or immunologist, I am a holistic, primary care physician and for over 20 years, I have studied this topic from experts who are addressing concerns, even at the risk of their career and reputation. Science traditionally has been about testing to prove or disprove a theory. And then sharing and debating one's findings with others. The mantra \"follow the science\" is not as clear as the phrase suggests, because modern \"science\" and its debate is heavily funded, controlled and censored by politicians, global elite, med-pharma and the media. Regrettably, it seems to be getting worse (see discussion and resources at end of this page). - [The Fifth International Public Conference on Vaccination](https://www.protectinghealthandautonomyinthe21stcentury.com/conference-live) - Oct 2020 This is your Right to Know and your Freedom to Choose. Experts from around the world share their experiences. Typically a pay-per-view program, this year the conference is posted on-line for everyone to view at no charge. There are about 50 presenters from numerous medical and scientific and advocacy organizations. This is current material for those looking for the meat-and-potatoes or hot topics of modern vaccine research and debate.

See also many other resources at the bottom of this page. - 1) FOR THE GREATER GOOD - Consider that the role of public health officials is to maintain the health of their country (planet?), the survivability of the whole population (as they see it). Public health is NOT about protecting the individual. In fact, while we would like to think that each person is of equal value, and that we are \"all in this together\" that is simply not the case. Any adult or child is expendable when it comes to protecting the welfare of the masses. Why does that point matter? Because health affects each of us individually (maybe somewhat as a family unit). And NO healthcare provider or public official is going to accept responsibility for your health choices and their consequences. That includes if you (or a family member) are unvaccinated and contract a serious illness or if you suffer a serious adverse side effect after a medical procedure (like surgery or vaccination). That burden falls back on you. While many officials and medical providers have compassion, is it reasonable to expect that they will put you ahead of their family or even others? (Granted, many people do risk life and limb to help others, e.g. during an emergency or disaster - but that is their personal choice of the moment, not dictated by the system.) Consequently, individuals (and families) must ultimately look out for themselves, the establishment cannot. The system looks out for the masses - It cannot consider your specific needs, genetics or other risk factors. This is how many actions of government are justified. (Furthermore, things can be much worse, when officials are actually making public policy that personally benefits them and \"their people\" OR if their end goal or agenda is not actually public health but something altogether different.) See also section #14. What the System CANNOT ever tell you, is if a choice (getting a particular vaccine for example) is Good or Bad for YOU (or your Child). You (hopefully with some help from a medical provider personally familiar with your circumstance) must evaluate and decide that yourself...

This may turn out to be good, but see that even the manufacturers explain that mRNA drugs are gene therapy. In 2020 the definition appears to be changed so that this can be called a \"vaccine\". Read page 1 and Here is a quote from page 19. \"Currently, mRNA is considered a gene therapy product by the FDA. Unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell DNA and could act as a source of side effects, mRNA based medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell DNA; however, side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mRNA medicines despite the differences in mechanism. In addition, because no product in which mRNA is the primary active ingredient has been approved, the regulatory pathway for approval is uncertain. The number and design of the clinical and preclinical studies required for the approval of these types of medicines have not been established, may be different from those required for gene therapy products or may require safety testing like gene therapy products.\" [Concern About Severe Adverse Reactions by Dr. Vernon Coleman](https://brandnewtube.com/v/haLXfJ) - Dec 2020 Dr. Coleman urges review of the CDC medical report (link attached to his website) that discusses serious side effects from mRNA vaccines. - [These People Should Not Get the COVID Vaccine by MSN](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/these-people-should-not-get-covid-vaccine-says-vaccine-maker/ss-BB1eIGwG?li=BBnb7Kz#image=2) - Mar 2021 If you have any allergies (not just severe), a fever, a bleeding disorder or are on blood thinners, are immunocompromised or are on a medicine that affects your immune system, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, are breastfeeding or have had another COVID vaccine. (Dr. Rolland's comments: What about those who have had COVID? At first, this was the type of cautions you would see. Then, there was concern that people would be discouraged from geting a vaccine. It seems now that many, people are being told that it is ok to still get a shot even if they have a condition on the list. Who takes responsibility for the complicaions?) (MARCH 15, 2021 - Dr. Rolland's comments: Many of these vaccine side-effects (even pain, paralysis, stroke, etc.) are being explained away as just normal immune response, coincidental or unrelated. While most are mild, some are very severe. The Oxford Astra-Zeneca administration has been recently halted in several European countries because of reports of blood clots (causing strokes and heart attacks?). This alarm is being brushed aside by some leading officials saying that they can't be related and that stopping vaccinations will jepordize the planet COVID recovery. More fearmongering? (The U.S.A. reportedly has 40 million A-Z doses we are sending to Mexico.) Why are officials pushing vaccines that are not fully tested for a disease that is mild for most people, that we now have medical treatments for and that seems to be in natural decline? A number of scientists and doctors are raising concern. It appears little funding has been spent on researching therapeutics for treating COVID compared to vaccines - which so far seem to only lessen but not stop the disease.) [5 Types of People Who Should Not Get Vaccinated by Eat This/Not That](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/5-people-who-%e2%80%9cshould-not%e2%80%9d-get-the-covid-vaccine/ss-BB1fePOm#image=6) - Apr 2021 Lists 5 types of people advised Not to get a COVID Vaccine. 1) Those actively sick with COVID. 2) Those who are under 16 or 18 depending on the vaccine 3) Those who are allergic to any ingredients 4) Those who had a bad reaction to a first shot 5) Those who have had a flu or shingles shot. (Dr. Rolland's comments: We used to add Pregnant women to the list. But there seems to be less concern in today's society for the unborn. We have documented that people who have allergies or had a bad reaction to a first shot are sometimes being told to go ahead \"you should be fine\" and they sometimes have severe reactions. Most who are recovered from COVID will have better (likely) immunity (broader against variants and longer lasting) than those vaccinated. We have listed studies showing possible increased risk of coronavirus reactions when you have had the FLU shot. They go on to say that everyone else can get it without any comments about other risks.)

Per news reports from NPR and the Europe (and hearing from patients about people who have suffered them), these clots can be in the lungs or brain. It seems that the AZ vaccine can cause an increase in platelets (clotting cells). Several countries in Europe have suspended the AZ vaccinations while investigating. As you have likely heard, in April 2021, the U.S.A. suspended Johnson & Johnson vaccines due to 6 severe (one death) reactions from blood clots. Most countries resumed the vaccines within a few weeks saying that the risk of COVID-19 outweighs the risk of the vaccine.

(Dr. Rolland's comments: This is just one example. I have seen numerous reports of these types of issues and even heard of these problems from patients. - e.g. Just recently from a patient whose relative is in the hospital for possible toe amputation from apparent vaccine clot complications. He was supposedly told to go ahead and get the second shot even though he had reactions to the first. You must INFORM yourself and CHOOSE what you think is better.) REMEMBER > These adverse-effects are only the SHORT term ones. Scientists below warn of MEDIUM & LONG term ones coming in 1 to 10 years. [Deaths, Anaphylaxis and other Vaccine Adverse Effects by Dr. Been Medical Lectures](https://youtu.be/SzSzU-eUVcM) - Mar 2021 Dr. Moybeen reviews the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS and vaccine reactions voluntarily reported by people getting COVID vaccines. There are 15,000 or more reported adverse reactions from each type of vaccine. There are over 1,000 deaths reported from vaccines during the last year with over 70% of those supposedly related to COVID vaccines. (Official investigations are yet underway.) Symptoms reviewed include pain, redness, fatigue, fever, skin irritation, facial droop, anaphylaxis, allergic reactions, eyesight effects, tremors, inability to move and death. (Dr. Rolland's comments: It is my understanding that at one point vaccine adverse event reporting was mandatory for all vaccines, but that the CDC may have discontinued that because of the high number of events found. Supposedly, HHS had Harvard Pilgrim do a 3 year study from 12/2007 - 9/2010 that found less than 1% of actual adverse events were voluntarily reported. Although I assume most of them were mild, that still seems like a lot of adverse reactions that are never documented or reviewed. How will we know if they are never reported?) - [International Vaccine Concerns by Dr. John Campbell](https://youtu.be/Sjtrev8cZnk) - Mar 2021 Explains how blood coagulation develop clots a.k.a.

Not concernced vaccine is causing. Vaccines being modified for variants? Vaccinations may help long-haulers with their symptoms. [Details Vaccine Safety Updates by Dr. John Campbell](https://youtu.be/2rULfhAbFQk) - Mar 2021 More on vaccine safety issues. Some countries restarting A-Z vaccine? Many adverse side-effect complaints including blood coagulation and anemia, low platelets, neurolgical complaints. Doctor says to continue with getting the vaccine because the benefits outweigh the risks - That you are 1,000 times more likely to die of COVID than a vaccine reaction. (Dr. Rolland's comments: But, are you average? Are you likely to die of COVID? Is that for each side effect or combined? How about co-morbidities? Even in my small practice, I have had patients tell me about personal deaths they feel have been driven by vaccine reactions.) [Post Vaccine Deaths by Dr. John Campbell](https://youtu.be/SHH1vWD19Fw) - Feb 2021 The U.S. has reported over 1170 vaccine deaths from 41 million doses administered. The U.K. about 250 deaths. The CDC & FDA track these numbers voluntarily through VAERS the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. The deaths are 0.003% of the vaccines administered. (Dr. Rolland's comments: Dr. Campbell expresses little concern about this, saying that these people were most likely older and sick and would have died anyways and that this is similar reactions to other vaccines. Is this all coincidental? While it is true that the percentage is small, this is only the first few weeks. Other reactions are yet to come. Some of the deaths are even younger people without pre-existing conditions? I have spoken with people who know of COVID vaccine recipients that unexpectedly died. And while the percentage of vaccine related deaths is small compared to the percentage of COVID deaths, vaccines do have a history of causing harm and even death. Lastly, these reports of these deaths and other adverse reactions are voluntary and the CDC has found from previous investigation that they only represent a small percentage of the actual adverse reactions. We will discuss this further below.) - [Seniors Dying After COVID Vaccines Labeled as Natural Causes by Mercola.com](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2021/02/02/covid-vaccine-death-seniors.aspx?ui=8f33154fece83d31f46afa10fccfd23dcfdedd1ba9f0989b54f355edd3e651be&cid_source=dnl&cid_medium=email&cid_content=art1HL&cid=20210202_HL2&mid=DM792926&rid=1074195813) - Jan 2021 CENSORED.

[TRY THIS LINK.](https://www.bitchute.com/video/7x3jP3yK2Pra/) - 2) YOU HAVE LITTLE RECOURSE IF INJURED AND DO NOT HAVE TRUE INFORMED CONSENT - Unlike other medications, congress created full indemnity for vaccine manufacturers (at their bequest - when the Supreme Court ruled that vaccines are unavoidably unsafe) back in the 1980's. Providers and medical facilities also have no responsibility for any adverse reactions. Since its inception, the government vaccine injury fund has paid out over 4 billion dollars to families with vaccine injured children - even though it is very difficult to legally prove vaccine damage and receive compensation. (I personally know 4 families with severely - life altering - vaccine injured children.) The medical bias that vaccines are truly safe, necessary and effective (without debate or question) leads many providers to not consider injury or even file a Vaccine Adverse Event Report (which they are legally required to do) when a parent raises their concern. One study found that barely 1% of potential vaccine injuries are reported to the CDC VAERS. Further, some doctors say that since patients are not accurately told what adverse reactions might occur or given an true benefit vs. risk analysis, it is not possible for them to make an educated decision and give true informed consent. The pandemic of 2020 has opened the eyes of many to the pros and cons of vaccines and possible alternative treatments. [You Can't Sue Pfizer or Moderna if You Have a Severe Vaccine Reaction by CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/16/covid-vaccine-side-effects-compensation-lawsuit.html) - Dec 2020 American vaccine manufacturers have indemnity from recipients who develop severe adverse reactions or die. The government may but likely won't compensate you either. You can't sue the FDA. There is a 36 month statute on applying for damages from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. NVICP pays on about 70% of claims that it has accepted between 2006 ad 2018. It has paid about $4.4 billion in compensation since it was established by congress in 1988 to shield vaccine manufacturers. COVID vaccines are not covered under the NVICP program but may be covered separately through a program called CICP. Few of those claims are settled (only $6 million dollars in the last 10 years since the program started). Claims must be filed within 12 months of injury.

If vaccines are so safe, why are Pfizer and other vaccine manufacturers requiring countries to put up assests as hard collateral or to change their laws giving them indemnity (against vaccine damage lawsuits) or saying they will not provide vaccine to countries who will not cooperate? Vaccine manufacturers are not charities and know there is a risk but won't openly talk about it. (I have seen this listed in other news sources now too.) [No Fault Vaccine Injury Compensation by NEJM](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2030600) - Oct 2020 Discussion in New England Journal of Medicine about how vaccine manufacturers want (need?) indemnity so they can provide vaccines for developing countries without risk. Says people who are vaccine damaged, perhaps should be compensated by those who benefited (those who are not injured) and pressured them to be vaccinated (i.e. the government?). There will be adverse reactions and deaths. Manufacturers are not asked to cover the costs of compensating the injured. In the interest of public health, the few pay a price so the many can be spared? [VAERS Patients Deserve to be Heard by The High Wire](https://thehighwire.com/videos/these-patients-deserve-to-be-heard-vaers-whistleblower/) - Sep 2021 It turns out that it is difficult to submit a report to the VAERS website. One doctor said that it takes her about 1/2 hour per submission and she has to do it after hours. It is legal but not mandatory - left up to the provider. - 3) DO THE VACCINE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THEIR RISKS? - Vaccination is one of the few instances that medication is given to a healthy person. The Benefits of vaccines include the avoidance of a particular disease, its sequelae, disability and possible death. The likeliness of those outcomes depends on the disease, exposure and one's health. The Risks of vaccines (read the manufacturer's warnings) can be mild or severe, temporary or long-lasting, sudden or later onset including: pain, fever, fatigue, allergic reactions, skin irritation, tremors, malaise, extreme exhaustion, blood clots, anaphylactic reactions, multi-system inflammatory syndrome, seizures & convulsions, facial droop, vision issues, auto-immune disorders, various forms of paralysis and death. While not common, all of these do occur. Adverse reactions generally involve inflammation and affect the nervous (including brain) and immune system. Reactions are hard to predict since everyone is different. Estimates are that 1 in 40 people have some type of vaccine reaction - some of them life changing. These reactions are caused in part by vaccine ingredients like aluminum, mercury (Thimerosal), PEG, culture proteins (i.e. chicken egg), etc. or immune reactions to the inactivated micro pathogen itself. [Simplified VAERS Numbers by OpenVAERS.com](https://www.openvaers.com/) - updated regularly from the CDC website. As of June 18, 2021 shows reports of over 387,000 adverse COVID vaccine reactions, 21,800 COVID vaccine hospitalizations and over 6,100 COVID vaccine related deaths. As of October 8, 2021 the CDC shows reports of 798,634 adverse vaccine reations, 79,669 hospitalizations, 16,766 deaths and 24,805 permanent disabilities.

This effects public health outcomes. See paragraph 3 of the Results page for these details. [The CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D8) - a searchable database of submitted vaccine adverse events that is updated regularly. This data base is very comprehensive. It is a voluntary reporting system - and while some reports may not be related to the vaccines they are reported with, according the the Harvard Pilgrim Lazarus Report, only about 1% of reactions are actually reported - meaning that the actual numbers of adverse reactions may be much higher. VACCINE INGREDIENTS: Traditional vaccines take part (or all) of a disease microbe and either disable (inactivate) or supress (attenuate) its actions using chemicals. Newer mRNA vaccines \"program\" the body to respond to a particular disease without including the microbe itself. Other chemicals are used to stablize and preserve the formula and still others to stimulate (adjuvants) our immune systems to respond to the injection. Ingredients reportedly cause allergic reactions (even anaphylaxis), short and long term neurological injuries and the potential to trigger autoimmune problems. Some of the toxic vaccine ingredients have been found in doses higher than what OSHA allows as acceptable adult exposure for the work place. Some of these ingredients accumulate in the body with multiple doses. (Dr. Rolland's comments: While Not common, I personally know 4 families with children who seem to have suffered SEVERE, life-altering injury from child vaccinations. See also the documentary Vaxed.) Here are some vaccine ingredients of concern: Egg protein - used for culturing some vaccines may cause allergic reactions PEG - polyethylene glycol used as a stabilizer may cause allergic reactions Polysorbate 80 - used as a stabilizer may create allergic problems. As a carrier, it may help move components across the blood-brain barrier. Aluminum - used as an adjuvant is a neuro toxin that may contribute to neurologic problems (Dementia, Alzheimers, etc.?). Mercury/Thimerasol - used as an attenuator and preservative to weaken certain vaccine microbes and to supress bacterial growth, it is a neuro toxin that may cause neurologcial problems (Autism, etc.?). Formaldehyde - used as a preservative (and for embalming) that may become a systemic toxin. Peanut Oil - possibly used as a stabilizer (refutted by Snopes as not being in any U.S. vaccines) is suspected of contributing to peanut allergies. Fetal tissues (or stem cells) - cells harvested from abortions are reportedly used (even for some COVID) to culture some vaccines. Monkey cells? - cells used for vaccine culture. >>STUDY OR MUDDY? It has been proposed that there are enough people deeply concerned about vaccinations (around 20 percent of the population?) that long-term research studies could be done to compare the overall health and mortality of vaccinated children and unvaccinated. It would be relatively easy to find such groups of volunteer subjects. Why have these never been done or published? (Only some observational studies have been made.) Wouldn't it be interesting and important to find out and settle some of the questions? Is it be about dogma and money (big vaccine research and administration programs)? What would happen if it was shown that vaccines are not as safe or effective as they are made out to be? Would that drastically change things? Do we need a vaccine for every common disease - even those with medical treatments?

Instead of testing COVID-19 vaccines against a benign saline placebo, manufacturers typically test against other ingredients (like PEG) from the vaccine which will lower the perceived side-effect differences. Worse, claiming a moral duty to use the ACTUAL vaccine as the \"placebo\" they can virtually eliminate any adverse reaction differences between the \"control\" group and the \"test\" group. To April 1, the VAERS has received COVID-19 vaccine reports of 56,869 adverse events including 7,971 serious injuries (usually requiring medical intervention) and 2,342 deaths (48% of which were within 48 hours of vaccination). For a disease that has a low case fatality rate and effective medical and nutritional therapies. [Can I Still Get COVID Even After I Have Been Vaccinated? by Market Watch](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/can-i-still-get-covid-19-even-after-im-vaccinated/ar-BB1e374G?ocid=mailsignout&li=BBnb7Kz) - Feb 2021 The short answer is Yes. Although, 95% (or what ever the studies show) of patients will only have a mild illness and will not die. (Dr. Rolland's comments: How are these numbers significantly different than the numbers from the natural infection? Most COVID-19 patients recover with only mild symptoms. Officially, vaccinated patients can still get infected but they are unlikely to get very sick or die. If they are sick, they most likely would be contagious to some extent. Vaccines prime the system but do not always create true immunity. Typically, a natural infection creates longer, broader immunity than its vaccine counterpart. Further, vaccines do not create full protection in all people and they all carry some short and long term risks.) [Vaccinated Can Get COVID But Very Rare? by NY Times](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/vaccinated-people-can-get-covid-but-its-most-likely-very-rare/ar-BB1eSQ7e?ocid=mailsignout&li=BBnb7Kz&pfr=1) - Mar 2021 Reports a few short-term observational studies suggesting that only a few people out of groups of vaccinated were getting sick with COVID-19. (Dr. Rolland's comments: I include this to help put those vaccinated who fear the unvaccinated more at ease. Probably the intention of the article. However, this report seems misleading. While the numbers may be accurate, this is not enough time to allow exposure of the subjects to SARS-CoV2 and with cases natually being fewer and fewer, and with masking and social distancing still in effect, one would expect these results. A true study would expose the vaccinated to the virus and test them for COVID - of course this is an unethical exposure risk and so true protective results will not be known. Further, only subjects not previously infected should be in the group since we know the recovered have a natural immunity without vaccination. A longer observation time after masks and distancing are listed would be more informative.)

While we do not know the actual benefits of the vaccines, the study at the end of this article from the Queen Mary, University of London found that naturally infected patients developed both antibodies and Tcells that provided immunity for at least four months. (likely longer, but these studies are cut short to go to print) April 14, 2021 - Per NPR, Chinese scientists reveal that they are using 4 vaccines which range from 50-83% effective limiting COVID-19.

[- Dec 22, 2020 The short answer is No. Once someone has recovered from COVID-19 they cannot spread it to someone else unless they are reinfected - which is very rare. (Dr. Rolland's comments: While we do not know how long immunity will last, there is some thinking that it will last for a while, maybe for years if like the 2003 SARS-CoV.)](https://medical.mit.edu/covid-19-updates/2020/12/can-someone-who-recovered-spread-COVID19#:~:text=We've%20been%20getting%20questions,is%20that%20reinfection%20is%20possible.)

According to U.S. Senator Massie, the CDC apparently found No benefit from Pfizer or Moderna vaccines for patients who had recovered from COVID-19. The CDC apparently corrected their incorrect position, but who will hear now? Can those vaccines instead go to others who need them? Is vaccination an unncessary risk for those who have been already infected? (Supposedly, getting the vaccine may help some COVDI long-haulers. Will it make any worse?) [Prior Infection Reportedly Creates Same Antibody Levels as 2 Shots by SciShow News](https://youtu.be/nucCr7Sywgc?t=241) - Mar 2021 Here is an example of some data they are suggesting means a recoverd person only needs one vaccination shot. However, they report that a preprint study showed prior infected health care workers had similar levels of antibodies to those uninfected getting 2 shots. And those prior infected getting one shot created antibodies 10x those uninfected. The rest of the video talks about how strong second shot vaccine symptoms are a \"normal\" immune response. (Dr. Rolland's comments: Maybe this suggests that most who recovered from COVID do Not need any shots. Does that risk an over response? Do you want to use those vaccines for someone else? Remember that (creating) antibodies is only one part of a healthy immune response.) [Should Prior Infected Patients Get Vaccinated? by MSN](https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/you-should-still-get-vaccinated-even-if-youve-already-had-covid-19-study-shows/ar-BB1eHepN?li=BBnb7Kz) - Mar 2021 Per this article review of a Lancet study, the overall \"protection\" rate was about 80% of those who had already been infected and recovered - did not catch it again. This protection was not as good for seniors over 65, suggesting that they should still get the vaccine. (Dr. Rolland's comments: This does not seem to jive with the total reinfection numbers that are being confirmed. Is this skewed by the inaccurate PCR testing? It does not say or question that. They also did not address that seniors typically do not have as good of response to natural infection OR vaccination. While Lancet is a reputable journal, who controls MSN?)

The results vary depending on the study. Recovered COVID patients tend to have more adverse reactions to vaccinations because their system is primed to fight.

A very pointed discussion between a journalist and Dr. Michael Yeadon, former top respiratory disease expert at Pfizer. Discusses questions about lock-down usefulness and true excess deaths (??), how lock-downs are preventing people from getting proper routine and emergency care (and causing deaths), how media and others are not giving the facts, how recovering from the virus means medically you HAVE immunity (we have NO drugs that cure viral infection - they only help your body do it) and lastly discusses concerns over the need for a vaccine (from someone who is in FAVOR of well tested and beneficial vaccines) and how ANY vaccine at this point is only experimental and that NO ONE knows the long term safety profiles. Explains the World War II international law (Nuremberg Trials?) establishing that it is a human right to not be forced to do any medical procedure that is not to your benefit or is against your will. Many references and links to doctors and citizen action groups against mandatory lock-downs. Well worth the watching the 45 minutes and reading article.

Only 1 in 8 responded that they feel current vaccines will never become ineffective. It reports that countries with low vaccine rates will promote this. (Dr. Rolland's comments: This appears to be a push for perpetual vaccine boosters. These projections vary widely. Some scientists say that countries with natural immunity and lower quarantine restrictions promotes weaker viral mutations, not the other way around. Still No comment about how much being healthy and taking nutritional supplements can help your body, REGARDLESS of the variant. Also no comment about how natural immunity tends to be more robust and more protective than a vaccine. Will people be sorry to have taken a vaccine in the first place?)

One big risk scientists are questioning is Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). Should patients be told about risks like ADE when they get a COVID vaccine? Do they read the consent form? Are they so scared of COVID (and offered no alternatives) that they will try just about anything to get away (Jurassic Park)? ADE is a serious condition in which a vaccine patient's immune system becomes primed to make not only neutralizing antibodies (which block a pathogen from entering our cells) but non-neutralizing which will still bind to a pathogen but Not prevent it from entering a cell. Rather, they may actually help (like a Trojan horse) the pathogen to infiltrate healthy cells (where they can replicate, etc). Some vaccines have been linked to deadly ADE reactions. Coronavirus vaccines have been linked to ADE. ADE can also be a time-delayed risk for similar future disease.

How she discovered that some vaccines (e.g. MMR) and blood were contaminated with recombinant viruses. Side effects of these included idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) which is a bleeding disorder like today with COVID-19. Her lab found that 30% had this contamination. She was arrested and pressured to retract her work in 2011. Threatened with all types of charges. She was told that higher ups would destroy her career and that of her boss unless she cooperated in the cover up. She refused. Describes how others were/are paid hush money. Her books Plague and Plague of Corruption tell how her voice is being silenced and detail the attack. Discussing the problem, corruption and healing solutions for cancer and other health problems. (Dr. Rolland's comments: This is incredible, but on par with things that I have heard, including the vendetta against Dr. Andrew Wakefield. I have seen all 7 parts of a series called The Truth About Vaccines from this group. They explain vaccine risks and are worth watching.) - 4) REASON OR FEAR? - THE ONGOING DEBATE - Consider what we seem to know and this conversation with a person fully vaccinated for COVID-19. \"Why did you get the vaccine? To protect myself from COVID-19 and so that I do not spread it to others. Do you believe the vaccine protects you from COVID-19? Yes. Are you aware doctors say that although these vaccines lessen the severity risk, they do not seem to altogether prevent one from catching COVID? Do you realize that if you develop COVID after your vaccine, you probably can still be contagious to others? Are you aware that once you have recovered from active COVID (7-10 days or less), that it seems almost impossible to be further contagious or again? Do you feel safer after your vaccine? Yes, but I am still uncomfortable around unvaccinated people. Why? Do you realize that scientists say these vaccines appear to significantly reduce your chance of developing severe COVID and dying? Are you aware that the percentage of people who will develop severe COVID even without a vaccine is below 1% for most people under 65 and that most of those people will recover? Do you know that scientists say it seems that these COVID vaccines appear effective against most variant mutations? Are you aware that natural immunity (developed from having the disease) is generally broader (against mutated variants) and longer lasting than that from a vaccine? Are you aware that scientists are saying it is extremely unlikely to contract COVID a second time? How long do you plan to wear a mask and do social distancing? Are you aware that there are now a number of medical treatments and natural products to help support recovery from COVID-19? What else are you doing to prepare and defend yourself against SARS-CoV2 and other infectious diseases besides vaccination? Are you aware that those with long-hauler symptoms do not seem to be contagious? Do you realize that milder forms of the disease are generally more contagious and that it might be preferred to have and recover from a milder form? Are you aware that it is highly unlikely for a vaccine process to eradicate a disease?\" A few more questions: Do you realize that all vaccines have some risks (generally unpredictable) of adverse side-effects, some of which on rare occasion, include disability and death? Are you aware that vaccines can sometimes make you more susceptible to other diseases? Do you realize that some vaccines may contribute to immune or neuro degenerative changes later in life? Should children be made responsible for their elders? Do you believe that people's personal health records should be kept private? Do you believe that people should have a right to decide what they do with their own bodies? Is this being Pro-Choice? - 5) SELF DETERMINATION - Consider this question: IF the complications of a disease are severe and if there are few if any effective treatments and if a vaccine is proven safe and is truly effective for that disease, and if all of those statistics are shared openly with the people, isn't it likely that most reasonable people will choose what is \"good\" for them? Why would there be a need to distort the issue and push a decision on people? On the other hand, if the complications of a given disease are typically mild and there are effective medical and alternative treatments and if a vaccine has an uncertain safety record and is not proven to be effective, what will most reasonable people choose when those statistics are openly shared with them? There are intelligent experts who articulate this argument with evidence from both sides. It largely comes down to what you believe is right for your family. Afterall, no mater what officials or doctors tell you, you and your family are the ones who will have to live with your decision. At least you should have the right to hear both sides and decide for yourself. Leaders unwilling to have an open debate but rather resorting to tactics of bullying and bribery would appear to have a illogical, weak position or something to hide.

[Does the State Have a Right to Force You to Vaccinate Your Kids? by Clifford Goldstein](https://www.libertymagazine.org/article/mandatory-behavior-rights-in-a-pandemic) - Mar 2021 LibertyMagazine.org discusses the legal conflict of state responsibility to protect the public versus individual religious and even secular personal liberty and choice. (Dr. Rolland's comments: I include this article because it illustrates the difficult balance between state responsibility and personal rights in a free-society. My concern is that from my perspective, I feel this well-respected author has overstated the risks of COVID-19, understated the risks of potential vaccines and not considered alternative treatments that might make a vaccine unnecessary. Health experts themselves cannot agree. Further, as questions arise around vaccine tracking and \"passports\" the growing personal and even religious liberty issues become even more concerning. From some points of view, the COVID-19 pandemic seems as much about politics, government expansion and social reconstruction as it is about public health. It begs the question about where to draw the line and whether America risks losing something much larger than health. See links and my comments elsewhere.) DR. BENJAMIN RUSH, George Washington's personal doctor and a signer of the Declaration of Independence reportedly said: \"Unless we put Medical Freedom into the Constitution, the time will come when medicine will organize into an undercover dictatorship. To restrict the art of healing to one class of men and deny equal privileges to others will constitute the bastille of medical science. All such laws are un-American and despotic... The Constitution of the Republic should make special provisions for Medical Freedom as well as Religious Freedom.\" (Dr. Rolland's comments: Please look up Dr. Rush and read some of his other very provocative comments about health care and your American liberties.) - 6) VACCINE PASSPORTS ARE MISLEADING or MUCH WORSE - Skipping over the multiple, non-reversible risks that health passports and contact tracing present to personal liberty (travel and association - totalitarian governments are enthusiastically embracing this technology as we speak), personal health privacy (risk of being hacked or manipulated for nefarious purposes) and discrimination (against someone's health status or free choices via bullying or bribery), please consider the unfounded, disease logic behind vaccine passports (however well intentioned by a worried public): UPDATE AUG 2021 - (Dr. Rolland's comments: It seems that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines provide narrow, non-sterilizing immunity that wanes over time. Do these vaccines build immune memory? Vaccinated people can still contract and transmit SARS-CoV2 (more so with variants?) and may require regular booster shots (every 8 months?). In contrast, post-infection immunity seems broad, robust and long-lasting. (Testing for memory T-cells could identify who has actual immunity.) Consequently, it seems that health passports ensuring \"safety\" based on vaccines are misleading, inaccurate and unfortunately only verification of jab compliance rather than immunity. - Passports being envisioned may be tied into and dictating one's work opportunities, travel & lodging access, banking & loans, insurance costs, shopping access, professional and driver's licenses, medical care restrictions, government assistance and ongoing testing and quarantine costs. This type of digital wallet and access program may have few legal remedies and little privacy.) First, vaccine passports which allow access, travel and assembly largely ASSUME and IMPLY that those individuals are \"safe\" (i.e. uninfected and non-contagious). But, this is both inaccurate and misleading. It is well known that vaccines are not capable of producing immunity or protection in 100 percent of injected persons. instead, COVID-19 studies, seem to reveal that they reduce the risk of severe disease and death in 65 to 95 percent of recipients. Some (just how many is unknown) vaccinated patients are being reported to not only contract, but then also spread the SARS-CoV2 virus. Second, COVID vaccine effectiveness is typically being measured by its ability to stimulate a certain level of antibody response. However, there seems to be little discussion about testing titers to actually verify one's supposed levels (of protection). Further, it is my understanding, that natural infection and recovery generally creates better antibody levels than vaccination. It has been known for decades, that in most cases, recovering from the natural disease creates a more durable (longer lasting) and robust (stronger and more effective even against mutated variants) immunity. Third, It is commonly understood, that once the short-term threat of disease is past (3-6 months or so?), antibody levels fade - historically known to occur both for vaccines and diseases. Unfortunately, there seems to be little discussion (and only limited testing for research) about how much the vaccines might stimulate memory B or T cells, as compared to the natural disease. Memory cells are those responsible for true long-lasting immune protection (in some cases over 60 years) and most likely avoid the need for any booster vaccines. (This is probably why it has been found that one is extremely unlikely to become re-infected OR spread the virus after recovery from natural COVID-19.) Fourth, some people just will not generate antibody or memory cells in response to a vaccine exposure or natural disease. Also, some people cannot be vaccinated \"safely\" because they are medically unable due to allergies or other health conditions that will likely put them at risk for a severe, adverse reaction or death. Further, scientists suggest that a percentage of the population seem to just not be susceptible to a particular disease. (e.g. Is there a correlation when over 80% of patients who suffer from severe COVID-19 have low vitamin D levels? See the 25 links on our vitamin D page.) Fifth, As with any official document, vaccine passports, will be counterfeitable and available for a price, if you know the right person. Perhaps even if the most invasive form of an implantable microchip is mandated. In conclusion, for vaccine passports to be medically useful, for what the public thinks they mean - to provide security from a disease, it seems that the system would need the following: 1) test (periodically) all vaccinated people for antibody and memory cell titers, 2) test (periodically) all naturally infected people for antibody and memory cell titers, 3) identify why some people never get infected and test them for that characteristic, 4) determine what the minimum titer standards will be, and 5) issue an un-hackable document that is confidential and accurately reflects true immunity of ALL people who actually have it. Is this even possible? (Yes, here I purposely left out debate about vaccine safety and focused only on effectiveness.) Finally, to include the whole population, the system would have to: 6) ensure that everyone is offered an effective vaccine, 7) decide how people who do not develop titers or cannot \"safely\" be vaccinated will be accommodated and 8) decide how people who choose not to be vaccinated will be accommodated. IS it possible to create a health passport document that is private and secure, accurate, fair and unbiased - one that is compatible with the foundational American principles of Liberty and Justice for ALL? Will actual benefits ever outweigh the risks? - What are the alternatives? Please don't be misled to think that someone's vaccine card proves that they are protected and safe to be around, while someone who has not been vaccinated is unsafe and dangerous to be around. That simply is far from the truth. Vaccines passports do NOT equate to safety and protection. Is Benjamin Franklin's quote fitting here? \"Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.\" (It seems that Thomas Jefferson and many other prominent leaders from our early society would agree with this principle.)

PLEASE LISTEN TO SHORT VIDEO. Dr. Wolf runs a tech business from New York. Health passports seem to violate the American Disabilities Act and the privacy of your personal health information (HIPPA and everything else). Your COVID status can be manipulated by the tech authority. Dr. Wolf explains how health passport technology can easily be interlinked between platforms like social media, health records, shopping and banking. She explains how the Chinese government CCP is using this system to track social credits (what you say and how well you comply with government policies) and then to reward or penalize various aspects of your life (shopping, work, school, travel, home, etc.). De-platforming is conditioning that follows the CCP reward & penalty process. Any dissident can quickly be located and handled. Once the technology is fully implemented (e.g. CCP) it will affect privacy, health care, travel, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, etc. - it will be irreversible. The article tells how some American schools are sending students to re-education classes for not wearing masks, also how some colleges are requiring daily, health status, digital check-ins. Organizations are conditioning citizens to watch and report their friends and neighbors. (All for a disease that has under 1% CFR and has effective medical treatments & natural therapies.)

Per CNBC, ZOOM VIDEO CONFERENCING was started by a Chinese immigrant and ITS DEVELOPMENT TEAM IS LARGELY BASED IN CHINA? - 7) HYGIENE AND NUTRITION PLAY KEY ROLES - To be clear, most pro-choice vaccine contenders are not against the intention of vaccination i.e. trying to save people (especially children) from suffering and dying from infectious diseases, but against the injurious side effects they cause. In fact, pro-choice advocates are very much in favor of providing clean water, nutritious food, vitamins, shelter and medical care for those who can't afford it. (As a primary care physician, I would like to help save every patient.) In Miller's book Vaccines: Are They Really Safe, the author documents the decline of many infectious diseases as a result of improved hygiene and nutrition - even before the introduction of a given vaccine. Technological advances and generosity can solve many problems of poverty. Unfortunately, vaccines are simply easier and cheaper to provide than nutritious food, clean water and hygiene...

For example, why don't doctors inform people that scientists have known for decades that Vitamin D and A are very helpful for children suffering from measles? (See Neil Miller's book for studies.) Instead we make a news story out of the unvaccinated - supposedly about 5-10% of the population and fail to mention that often, many involved in an outbreak are found to have had the recommended vaccinations. (It turns out that many of those who question the status quo tend to be educated, upper class families - not uninformed, lower class, worriers that the media tends to portray them as.) There are numerous effective ways (see elsewhere on our website) to improve one's metabolic health, optimize one's immune system and provide support which helps resist and recover from most diseases. - 9) HERD IMMUNITY: WHICH VACCINES ARE NECESSARY? - Herd immunity is the amount of a population estimated to need to have immunity (natural or via vaccine) to a given disease so that the contagious spread (from person-to-person) of the disease declines to the point that it is no longer a significant threat. Scientists estimate how many people a sick person might infect. A number (R0 value) greater than one will increase the disease spread while a number less than one will cause it to decrease. The discussion of herd immunity is admitted as being something that just is not accurately known, more of an estimation. Rather the number may continue to be inched higher, as people accept it - until the goal reaches 100 percent. Further, that target number (for 2020 at least) does not officially allow for natural immunity but that it must be from vaccine (at least that seems to be true with W.H.O.'s new, narrow definition of herd immunity or most government officials). Numerous experts disagree saying history has shown that natural (post infection) immunity generally is found to be as strong (effective), durable (long-lasting) and broad (against variants) or even better than that from vaccines. (Some vaccines do not prevent a disease but merely reduce its severity and possibly its level of spread.) Variants are mutations - sometimes they are more contagious. Usually more contagious variants are less lethal. That is what it seems with most SARS-CoV2. Some scientists (like Geert Vanden Bossche, PhD, DVM) explain how prophylactic vaccines (like most for SARS-CoV2) can theoretically make mutations worse. REGARDLESS - Improving Your Immune System Health is ALWAYS a safe, effective strategy for helping with disease.

Since vaccines are not without (significant?) risk and since at this age babies are often getting immunity from mother's breast milk, why, you might ask, do we inject infants with vaccines? (How many of them are likely to contract hepatitis or certain of these other diseases?) Under two is known to be an especially critical time for the development and disruption of the nervous system. (Knowing this, some countries and some doctors routinely do NOT give vaccines to children under one or two years of age.)

The report says that so far 3.3 million cases of COVID-19 have been documented with 13,000 hospitalized and 260 total deaths. As of Sep 2021 the CDC estimates that 25 million children have had COVID-19 and 424 total deaths. >>((Dr. Rolland's comments: CAUTION PLEASE... >>FIRST, this article expresses concern for long-term effects of COVID-19 but gives no mention of the long-term effects of vaccines (see our detailed comments elsewhere) - especially experimental ones. >>SECOND, while still deeply tragic and I want to help them all, most child fatalities tend to have comorbities. Even think of our childhood obesity rates. And as we know, most children have a robust immune system (discussed in detail elsewhere) that quickly handles COVID-19. Per these NYT numbers, the approximate COVID mortality of children is 0.008% (>i.e. 1 in 12,600 cases), and remember for all adults about 0.5% (i.e. 1 in 200) and those over 65 about 6%. And with some experts estimating actual cases are 4x official numbers (in 2021 some are saying 10x) that might be 13 million total cases so far for children. (>That might lower the total child mortality rate to 0.002% or 1 in 50,000 cases.) Per Dr. Campbell's vaccine adverse reaction calculations (in support of vaccine safety), he says that adults are \"1000 times more likely to die from COVID than the vaccines\" based on data so far. Yes, some people are dying from COVID vaccines (details addressed elsewhere on this page). So by dividing, we see for discussion sake that children overall are 63 times less likey to die than all average adults. Dividing that by Dr. Campbell's estimation, children are 16x more likely to die from COVID than from vaccination or if the 4x case estimate is correct, they are only 4x more likely to die from COVID than the vaccine - neither guaranteed. Of course, this assumes that a child definitely gets COVID. And these number averages are likely to decline (improve) further since we now have effective medical treatments and natural therapies (even used by hospitals now). I am having patients with older, unhealthy parents who contract and recover (with medical care) from COVID tell me their doctors say in surprise that they did not expect them to pull through. >>OK. IT IS UP TO YOU. But with numbers like this for average patients who do Not typically take extra measures to Optimize the health of their children, I have to say, WHY WOULD THEY TAKE THAT CHANCE WITH ON A CHILD'S LIFE (all still ahead of them) ON A VACCINE VS. COVID itself (when there are many other ways to help them)??? >>LASTLY, to the argument that children need to be Part of the pandemic solution. This is different than asking a college student to be careful and not unnecessarily expose their elders. Is it ethical/reasonable to ask a child, to risk their health and possibly life (getting a vaccine), so that an adult can have a better chance at theirs? Most adults that I know, especially grand parents, would give up their lives to save a child, if that is what the choice came down to. We can help both. - - - My numbers may be off here, but I have yet to come across anyone putting these calculations together differently.)) [Recommended Childhood Vaccine Schedule by CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html) - 2021 There are an estimated 72 vaccinations (some in combination injections) that are recommended for children by age 18. Why don't we have a vaccine for every possible disease? Because experts say they are difficult to safely and effectively make and that your body would not survive that many jabs (immune assaults). Why don't we still administer the small pox vaccine? Because the vaccine risk is not worth the benefit - especially with modern healthcare and nutrition and hygiene. Those who promote vaccines (which are neither 100% safe or effective) without informing patients how to optimize their immune system seem to be ignorant or biased and without true concern for the well-being of those they advise. CFR = case fatality rate (or the apparent risk of death once contracted). >> This section is under development to discuss the risks of each disease compared to those of the vaccine.

It appears we have known for 50 years that vitamins A & D are very effective to help with measles. MMR maybe one of the highest risk combo vaccines. DIPTHERIA/ PERTUSSIS/ TETANUS - Pertussis (whooping cough) seems to be one of the highest risk vaccines. (Tetanus - 50% CFR? The tetanus vaccine can be given separately.) HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS (HPV) - Low CFR. This seems to be one of the most dangerous vaccines (neurologic side effects & death) for a disease that is largely avoidable. HEPATITIS B - POLIO - This disease is officially under control but some physicians say it is being renamed in todays health care experience. YELLOW FEVER - 3-7% CFR DENGUE FEVER - 4% CFR MERS - 35% CFR ANTHRAX - ? - 12) HOW MOST VACCINES WORK - Basically, they are an artificial way to stimulate your immune system to respond to a disease that it has not naturally been exposed to in the wild, with the intention that the immune system memory will be primed and ready to quickly defend against any similar real pathogen in the future. Their actions can't be reversed. Some may cause other short and long-term health problems. (See risks above.) Follow-up boosters may be needed. How effective are they? Are there effective, healthy alternatives now that we are in the 21st century? Traditional vaccines generally have taken part (or all) of a disease microbe and either disabled (inactivated) or suppressed (attenuated) its actions using chemicals. Other chemicals are used to stabilize and preserve the formula and still others to stimulate (adjuvants) our immune systems to respond to the injection. When recipient's immune system comes by, it identifies the foreign agent and triggers the immune system to build antibodies to attack (as if it saw the disease) and neutralize the invader. Later memory T & B cells are made (typically) so the immune system will remember. Here are some potential problems with traditional vaccines: 1) Aside from the allergens present, artificially, stimulating the immune system over and over again without having an invader to fight, is thought lead towards autoimmune disorders in some people. 2) Some of the chemicals (mercury, aluminum, PEG) used with vaccines also are toxic in themselves and are thought to cause adverse reactions for some people.) Newer mRNA vaccines \"program\" the body to respond to a particular disease without including the microbe itself. They hide a code of mRNA inside a lipid nanoparticle (tiny fat) and injected into the muscle. The mRNA then instructs your body to make a foreign protein strand - in this case the SARS-CoV2 spike. When recipient's immune system sees the spike it triggers the immune system to respond and make antibodies (as if it had seen the disease) to attack and neutralize the foreign invader. How mRNA Vaccines Work - There are 10 to 30 billion mRNA strands in each vaccine injection. Those strands are enclosed in a fatty (lipid) nano (tiny) particle so that they can enter cells and your body does not dissolve them. Those particles travel throughout (everywhere?) your body telling your cells to make protein copies of the spike from the virus. These proteins are created throughout your body. When your immune system sees the spike protein, it is identified as foreign and attacked by your innate immune system while cytokine signals order your body to make antibodies. Within 7-10 days the antibodies are available to attack the spike protein. These antibodies stay active for 5-8 months. If you encounter the actual virus, the antibodies attach to the spikes and disable it. Every additional shot stimulates more immune reaction (and sometimes worse adverse effects). The problems are that it is apparent that vaccine stimulated immune function wanes and may require a booster shot (every 6 months?). While that is also normal for natural immunity, natural exposure also builds memory T-cells that quickly reactivate when one is re-exposed - that does not seem to be so effective for these vaccines. And when the virus mutates, vaccine antibodies may not attach to the spike if it has changed enough. (During natural infection, our immune system identifies many different points to attack and builds an array of antibodies against them.) Here are some of the potential problems with the mRNA process explaining the many adverse side-effects: 1) It turns out that the spike itself is bioactive and causes toxic reactions. When our immune system locates spikes throughout our body (even places that the natural virus would not naturally go), they are attacked and contained - sometimes creating clots (big and tiny). (See videos by Dr. Hoffe explaining this clotting process and how running D-dimer tests showed elevated clotting in 62% of his patients within 4-7 days of vaccination. He discovered this while looking for treatment options for COVID vaccine complications. (This is one theory why more vulnerable (already sick) people succumb to illness and death shortly after jabs.) 2) The lipid nanoparticles do not stay in the arm but travel throughout the body, going places that the virus itself would not likely ever go, e.g. concentrating in ovaries, bone marrow, etc. 3) The lipids help hide the mRNA from the immune system and it is unknown how long they last. 4) Per the Moderna filing there is a potential they could affect the recipient's DNA. 5) The spikes show up throughout the body and the immune system attacks them causing random chaos and damage. 6) It is unknown how well this process creates memory immune cells and it appears that \"boosters\" will be needed. 7) The targeted spikes are only part of the virus and if mutation occurs, the recipients immune system may not recognize the variant. 8) Various chemicals (graphene, etc.) used for the gene therapy \"vaccines\" may themselves cause adverse reactions. 9) Finally, as with most vaccines, when actual allergens are absent - artificially, stimulating the immune system over and over again (without having an actual invader to fight), is thought to lead towards autoimmune disorders in some people (increasing 4% per year in the general U.S.A.). [Johnson & Johnson Safety & Efficacy vs. Pfizer and Moderna by Dr. Seheult](https://youtu.be/13qT7wLxkvU) - Feb 4 Technical comparisons and how J&J seems to do rather well even for variants to limit severe symptoms and death, with effectiveness getting better as a few weeks pass. J&J is a more traditional vaccine that has inactivated viral components and does not require special refrigeration and only requires one shot. A one shot vaccine may have fewer side-effects since they tend to occur from later shots after the immune system is primed. This vaccine is easier to store and administer.

Of course who is it that gets to make that decision about whether it is ok or not? Some officials view patients or students or citizens from a paternal perspective. In other words, \"we know better than you do what is good for you\" and it is okay for us to lie to you to achieve those ends. (See also topic 1 For the Greater Good.) Per Dr. Malone, the three great lies of the pandemic are: 1) the only way to end the pandemic is through herd immunity 2) the only way to herd immunity is for everyone to be vaccinated 3) C*VID vaccines are proven safe and effective. Each of those false assumptions are scientifically addressed extensively elsewhere on this website. Another example, is that of required \"mandatory vaccines\" for admission to school. While powerful entities are working diligently to make endless vaccinations mandatory for every child at every school, in many states they are not. Various exemptions exist. It seems that most school officials (typically nurses) know this. Yet, they continue to send out letters to parents saying that your child will not be allowed to play sports or will not be allowed to enter school if they do not have said vaccine? They do not provide any semblance of informed consent including discussing possible accommodations or available treatments. This has become accepted behavior. - I know this first hand. On the flip side of my state's vaccine tracking card is the vaccine waiver form (for medical, religious and philosophical reasons). >See section 17 below for legal resources if you need an exemption.< Are vaccines so problematic that we need to bribe and then coerce patients to get them? In 2021, there are proposals allowing for 12 year-olds to consent themselves to vaccines (and other medical procedures) and to even then to prohibit medical providers, schools and insurance companies from being allowed to disclose this choice to their parents or guardians. Along this line, some parents report discovering their child had been vaccinated against their will by a medical provider while they were out of the room - no consequences. (Beyond these examples, whistle blowers and concerned politicians, scientists and doctors have spoken out for years about various aspects our growing, for-profit vaccine program. Reportedly pediatric and even some other medical office get bonuses from the vaccine industry for having the compliant percentage of their patients above a certain number.

Detailed discussion and a link to the Fifth International Vaccine Conference. Is there a risk for developing countries? - 15) FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS - Vaccines are a profitable business for many pharmaceutical companies (and the CDC) and those who distribute them. While they are very expensive to develop, once they are approved (generally after many years of failures) they provide a protected income stream for over 20 years. (There are reportedly over 200 vaccines in the development pipeline. Can vaccine companies get the CDC to continue to expand the schedule of \"required\" vaccines, e.g. varicella - chicken pox? Granted some, like a malaria vaccine, would be an international life saver of over 1 million (mostly African children under age 5) annually. Unfortunately, the priorities of poor nations, do not set typically set the agenda for profit dependent companies.) Medical offices (pediatricians mainly) not only get paid to provide vaccination services but it is my understanding that many are monetarily incentivised to maintain a high level of vaccine compliance and some receive additional bonuses. (Most pediatric offices that I am aware of, will not even accept children who are not on the recommended vaccine schedule.) Ironically, most physicians and scientists who speak out in favor of vaccine choice are villianized and risk their careers, reputations and livliehoods to do so but have no financial incentive (yes, a few have written books on the subject) but rather do it out of concern for children and public health. This again supports the argument that vaccines are for public health and Not about what is best for the individual child. (Otherwise we would do genetic safety testing, better monitor adverse reactions, check blood titers and allow personalized choices.) NPR On Point in mid February 2021 discussed paying patients to get the COVID-19 vaccination. They addressed concerns that paying someone to get a medical procedure suggests that it is not intrinsically safe. And that bigger incentives further bring into question the benefit and even morality of getting the questioned procedure (in this case a vaccine). This is the only medical procedure that I am aware of for which patients are pressured, even coerced and now paid (bribed?) to receive. Yes, companies are reimbursing employees to get vaccinated.

Dr. Bossche discusses that the virus mutates within hours and that it is important to have your immune system ready for it.

Counselor Ted Kuntz of [Vaccine Choice Canada](https://vaccinechoicecanada.com/) is working to ensure informed consent and vaccine choice for all people. He has a vaccine injured son (now deceased). Ted describes his 20 year investigation of the risks of vaccines and the bias of the medical and pharmaceutical industries. He sees the pandemic not as the Great Reset but as the Great Reveal - showing the true colors of people, industry and government. He feels that most officials are ignoring the law, constitutional rights, science and even fundamental human rights of self-determination and religious freedoms. People are seeing the incurable corruption and moving away from it to make a new society. Ted says that we have lost the freedoms even of skepticism, dialogue and debate. He sees his role to lift people up, encourage and nourish them, helping them to see they are powerful and not alone. He has written a book: How Can I Wake Up When I Don't Know That I Am Asleep?. Ted has also published his 20 years of vaccine investigations in a free ebook at [www.DareToQuestionVaccination....](http://www.DareToQuestionVaccination.com). He invites anyone to join their weekly calls. He appreciates the efforts of Make Americans Free Again, the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN) and the Constitutional Rights Centre of Canada.

A process in which a question (hypothesis) is first asked. Then an experiment is designed to help answer the question, either proving or disproving (possibly being inconclusive). After repeating the process (testing, observing and analyzing results), a theory can then be developed. Remember that the purpose of science is to test and expand knowledge - so that one does not have to use faith to believe something. What do people really mean when they say they trust or believe science? True science is not a religion. Science is NOT about believing a person or institution. The scientific method was developed to test things that are not yet known against things that are. Again, it is about measuring and evaluating a control group (known?) against a test group (unknown). Results (and the methodology) are then openly reported for evaluation and testing by others - to either confirm or refute. Data is shared for examination and attempted replication. If multiple experiments can replicate the results (data) under the same circumstances, then a theory is developed and validated. This does Not create facts. It is not \"settled\" or indisputable but rather, is that information which is most knowable at the time. (A fact would be something like the speed of light in a vacuum or the chemical composition of water.) Science requires that theories must be open at any time to a challenge via vigorous, open, public debate. The person sighting science must be able to explain the data supporting their current theory and how it was tested. Merely saying that one believes in science is paramount to saying that one believes in the authority speaking and is declaring that they have trust (faith) in them. The purpose of science is to allow the methodical and logical explanation of something. It seems that science is never fully settled. Complex data is often open to interpretation. New data can be discovered. Public policy is NOT science. Rather, public officials must take data and theories (as they are known at the time) and make difficult public health and policy decisions - considering the trade-offs (the pros & cons of all sides) of a decision and the potential short and long term impacts on their constituents. That is one difference between science and politics. When people resort to cancelling, censoring, shouting down, degrading, mocking, name calling, bullying and bribery, science is left behind. It likely indicates that emotions are ruling and that there is not sufficient evidence to logically \"scientifically\" support the position being held. To declare that it must be believed without debate is elevating science to a religion. Officials who push this are not generally ignorant but malicious and controlling. Professionals (rather everyone) should support, even encourage, open and vigorous debate with an open and critical mind to test and examine data and theories (conclusions) drawn from it. That is the scientific process. [Science is About Debate Not One Person's Opinion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4nyANapULo) - Dec 2020 U.S. Senator Rand Paul, M.D., asserts that science is about open debate. THIS VIDEO APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN REMOVED. [You Must NOT Do Your Own Research When It Comes to Science by Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2020/07/30/you-must-not-do-your-own-research-when-it-comes-to-science/?sh=5a168e35535e) - Jul 2020 Dr. Rolland's comments: You may find this article mentally challenging or even condescending. This author (an astrophysicist and science writer) seems to think rather highly of his opinion that one must dutifully follow the dictates of science experts and not critically evaluate the evidence. Establishing authority is a well known tactic of public debate. If science is a testable, demonstratable and debatable process then isn't declaring that one must Not question or try to think through a topic (because they don't know enough), but rather to simply follow the \"experts\", paramount to declaring it to be a religion that one should follow with something like faith? Is science about who is in the majority, popular, in charge or the most credentialed? Wasn't the earth Known to be flat or the center of the universe once upon a time? What does one do, when credentialed experts disagree with one another? Is it reasonable to demand proof? Should a true scientist declare a verdict without proof? Should they admit when they are uncertain? Theoretical models are just that, ways to predict what is likely happen. They are not proof. The \"irrefutable\" examples selected by the author - water fluoridation, climate change and vaccines have been tainted on both sides by special interests, political agendas and profit driven entities for decades. They continue to be hotly debated topics. Declaring that they are \"settled science\" (another method of silencing debate) is disingenuous and even hurtful to the scientific process itself. It seems that when one wants people to follow their declarations without question or open debate, they should not call it science. - 20) HARD QUESTIONS - The topic of vaccination raises a number of fundamental questions like: How does a vaccine work? What is the Benefit vs. Risk of taking a given vaccine compared to the disease itself? What other treatments are available for a given disease? What are the short-term side-effects and long-term risks? Are vaccines are a public health program that is focused on caring for the masses and rather than the individual? Is it possible that there is not a one size fits all vaccine option? Why is it that it seems impossible to have an open discussion about this topic? Isn't real science about open debate and consideration of data regardless of where it leads? Why do officials use techniques and tactics to push this issue forward in spite of some strongly varying evidence? Why are fear and cherry picking data needed to support either side? If something is truly good and can be shown to be so, won't that be appealing to the average thinking person? What about the whole principle of medical choice? Are ethics being set aside for the greater good? For the record: I am not against the concept of vaccination but feel that vaccine benefits and risks should be thoroughly considered so that patients can make a truly informed decision for themselves and their families - especially since there is no one else who will take responsibility for them if they have a poor outcome. Why did vaccine manufacturers need congress to protect them from lawsuits? Is this the only medication that manufacturers are not responsible for? Why did the Russian research scientist say that people would not survive if they got a vaccine for every disease? How often can we expose our body to toxins and meddle with our immune system before creating problems? How much were diseases already in decline due to hygiene and nutrition before vaccines were introduced? The concept of vaccines is amazing - and how the body responds to disease. How shelf stable are these new vaccines and then what happens? Is it likely that after spending over $15 billion dollars developing a vaccine that it won't be used? Is this the research and test opportunity that biotech firms have been dreaming about? Isn't it amazing to be able to develop and deliver a vaccine in less than 12 months? What is the purpose of gain of function research (now mostly illegal in the U.S. and we pay China to do) - officially to see how bad it might get and what we need to defend against / unofficially for bio-warfare? Why does the manufacturer get to do their research and pick the data they will submit to authorities at FDA for approval? Is it a good idea for industry scientists and regulatory scientists in government to be offered interchangeable employment? How does stimulating the immune system over and over affect it? Should it be a choice? 21) EPILOGUE - Looking at a picture of politicians lining up for a photo op and listening to media headlines, someone posed this question: \"When times are good and everything is running smoothly, do you believe everything that your doctor tells you let alone all that the media or politicians are saying?\" If you are hesitant to answer \"Yes\", what makes you think that in difficult times, when the political climate is heated and billions of dollars are at stake that things will be better? Everyone has a bias that influences how they view the world. Even doctors and other people you typically trust can sometimes be influenced. Can we have open debate and be allowed to consider multiple information sources and attempt to think for ourselves? There is no final answer to this debate. It comes down to what you see and believe is right for your family. Afterall, life is full of risks and you are the one who will have to live with your decision.
