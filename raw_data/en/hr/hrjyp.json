Not just for you, but also for the planet. Looking for vitamins and health supplements can be daunting and difficult as most companies lack ingredient traceability and full transparency on their sustainability efforts. Don't worry though, this list of ten sustainable vitamin and supplement companies will make your shopping that much easier! Of course, always consult with your doctor before starting or making any adjustments to your health regimen. What to look for when shopping for vitamins and supplements Sustainable Packaging- Many companies package vitamins in plastic bottles which are usually recyclable but not always. You must remove all labels and since some are unable to be removed, they're often not recyclable. Additionally, small plastic bottles cannot always be recycled due to falling between sorting facility equipment. Always check your community recycling guidelines to ensure any recycling materials are the correct size and material so it doesn't contaminate the load. If you can opt for companies that use glass, post-consumer recyclable plastic, or compostable pouches. Ingredient Traceability- Where your vitamin ingredients come from matters just as much as your food. Look for USDA organic or non-GMO certifications along with vitamins that don't use fillers, synthetic ingredients, additives, colorants, and additional sweeteners. Comprehensive Testing- You don't want to waste money on products that haven't been tested for purity or potency. Reputable vitamin companies stand behind their products with third-party testing that ensures their efficacy and quality.
