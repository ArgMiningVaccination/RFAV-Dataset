Background . There is an increasing need for a worldwide professional integration of conventional medicine and tradi- tional/complementary whole medical systems (WMSs). However, the integration is perceived by conventional medicine as problematic or unacceptable, because of a supposed lack of evidence for specific effects of WMSs therapies and supposedprescientific or unscientific paradigms of WMSs. Objectives . To review the literature on the features of WMSs, similarities and differencesbetweenconventionalmedicineandWMSs,andscientificandclinicalpracticeissuesthatshouldbedealtwithinorder to promote the integration process. Methods. A critical, narrative review of the literature on six WMSs. Results and Conclusions . Key factors for the integration of WMSs and conventional medicine are as follows: legal frameworks, quality standards, high- quality research on safety and efficacy of WMS interventions, infrastructure, and financial resources. For scientific assessment of WMSs, there are unresolved ontological, epistemological, and meth odological issues and issues of diagnostics, therapy delivery, and outcome assessment in clinical practice. Future research not only should be directed at quality assurance and generating the necessary data on safety and efficacy/effectiveness but also should address more fundamental (ontological, epistemological, and methodological)issues,inordertoovercomethedifferencesbetweenWMSsandconventionalmedicine. 1. Introduction \"Medicineisascienceandpracticeofintervention,manipu- lation,andcontrolconcernedwithcuringsickpeople,caringfor sick people, preventing maladies, and promoting health\"[1] (p. IX). Throughout human history, different cultures inall parts of the world have had their own type of medicine.InWesterncountriesandcultures,conventional,biomedical-based medicine has been developed, rooted in the natural sciences that had developed since the Middle Ages, [2]. In many non-Western cultures but also in Western cultures, several types of whole medical systems (WMSs) [3], that is,complete systems of theory and practice that have evolvedindependentlyovertimeindifferentculturesandapartfromconventional medicine or Western medicine [3], have beendeveloped. Currently WMSs, often referred to as traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) or (traditional and)Complementary and Alternative medicine (TCAM/CAM),andconventionalmedicinearefoundinalmostallcountriesin the world. WMSs are in increasing demand by patientsand are also studied in universities (e.g., the AcademicConsortium for Integrative Medicine & Health in the USA).Accordingtothe\"TraditionalMedicineStrategy:2014-2023\"of the World Health Organization (WHO), \"the public andconsumers of health care worldwide continue to include Hindawi Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Volume 2017, Article ID 4904930, 13 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/49049302 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine T&CM in their health choices. This obliges Member States to support them in making informed decisions about theiroptions\" [4] (p. 18). \"As the uptake of T&CM increases,there is a need for its closer integration into health systems.Policy makers and consumers should consider how T&CMmay improve patient experience and population health\" [4] (p. 19). A central argument in favor of integrating T&CM into conventional medicine is that T&CM has additionalknowledge and interventions on preventive and curativehealth promotion [5]. The integration can therefore con-tribute to current issues in public health and healthcaresuch as developing strategies of healthy ageing, promotingself-management, and controlling healthcare expenditures[6, 7]. Positive examples demonstrating supporting theWHOstrategyofintegratingthebestofbothofworldsfromT&CMandconventionalmedicinearetheintegrationoftheAYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, andHomeopathy (AYUSH)) system in the conventional systemin India [8], the increasing use of mindfulness techniquesin the treatment of depressive disorders [9], and the use oftraditionalmedicinalsystemsinreducingtheprescriptionofantibiotics in Thailand as one of the strategies to fight theglobalantimicrobialresistanceproblem[10]. This WHO position on integration of T&CM and con- ventional medicine is in contrast with the developments inmany Western countries. Whereas many traditional med-ical systems were tolerated in clinical practice next to orintegrated with conventional medicine in many Westerncountriesuntiltheendofthe20thcentury,thissituationhasrapidlychanged,asaresultoftwointerrelateddevelopments regardingscience-basedmedicine: (i) Thefirstdevelopmentistheincreasingdominanceof evidence-based medicine (EBM) in medicine since t h e1 9 9 0 s[ 1 1 ] .A sar e s u l t ,i d e a l l y ,o n l yt h e r a p i e swithhigh-qualityscientificevidence(fromsystematic reviewsandmeta-analysesofrandomizedcontrolled trials) on safety and (cost) effects are accepted inmedicine [12]. And although in practice many con-ventionalmedicalguidelinesforalargepartarebasedonlowerqualityscientificevidence(includingclinicalexpertise),foropponentsoftheintegrationofT&CMand conventional medicine, a lack of high-qualityscientific evidence is often used as an argumentagainstintegration. (ii) The second development has to do with the roots of scienceintheorydevelopmentandtheorytesting[13].In the last decades, the dominanceof the biomedicalmodel in medicine has led to scientific criticism ofWMSsduetotheirtheoreticalbasisthatisperceivedas not being in agreement with biomedical theories,but based on paradigms deemed as prescientificor unscientific. Furthermore, there is allegedly noevidenceforspecificeffectsofCAMmedicinalprod-ucts for conventional indications as tested in clinicalstudiesaccordingtotheEBMparadigm[14,15].Andalthough in science currently the reductionist modelis increasingly challenged and the WMSs theoreticalmodels appear to be content-wise in line with thesystems approaches in science and medicine, oppo-nents of the integration of T&CM and conventionalmedicineusetheassumedprescientificorunscientifict h e o r e t i c a lm o d e l so fW M S so ft e na sa na r g u m e n tagainstintegration. On the other hand, there are positive examples of integra-tion, like the integrated use of Ayurveda and conventionalmedicine in treating elephantiasis in India, that resulted ina lifetime achievement award from the InternationalSocietyof Dermatologists for Oxford professor of DermatologyTerence Ryan; the highly successful integrated treatment ofdepressionwithYogamedicineandconventionalmedicineinth eN a tio nalI n s ti t u t eo fM en talH eal tha n dN eur oscien ceinBangalore (Bengaluru) in India; and the widely adopted useofYogamedicineforgeriatricsinJapan. G i v e nt h ec u r r e n tn e e df o rs o m et y p eo fi n t e g r a t i o n of conventional medicine and traditional/complementary medicine in countries all over the world, the large amount of scientific publications and the ongoing scientific debate on this topic among proponents and opponents, we decidedto perform a critical review on the literature. Our aim is to provideatransparentoverviewonsimilaritiesanddifferences between WMSs and the conventional medical system and,based on this overview, identify issues that have to be dealt withinordertoovercomethedifferences.Itisexpectedthat this overview will support informed decision-making in the integrationprocess. 2.

Scope of the Review, Databases, and Search Terms. In order to address the six research questions, we included the following six WMSs: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)[16,17],Ayurveda[18,19],UnaniMedicine[20],Homeopathy [21],Naturopathy[22],andAnthroposophicMedicine(AM) [23, 24].

Beyondthescopeofthisarticleisacomprehensivereview ofthediscussionsofthetopicsof(supposed)lackofevidenceon specific effects of WMS treatments and the (supposed)lack of tested WMS theories. Nonetheless, these topics arebrieflydiscussed. We searched the database PubMed, Google Scholar, and our own literature archives. Combinations of searchterms used were as follows: whole medical Ayurveda, and Unani) are based on old traditions (first classical texts in the first millennium BC, predated by oral transmissions from the second millennium BC),each from a specific culture: TCM developed in China in connection with the philosophical traditions of Taoism (Lao Tzu, 605-531 BC) and Confucianism (Confucius: 551-479 BC), with classical TCM texts written in the period 221-207 BC[25,26].AyurvedadevelopedontheIndiansubcontinentin connection with Hinduism; classical Ayurveda texts mainstream Medieval medicine and still used in Unani is the Canon of Medicine (1025 AD) by Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 980-1037 AD) [29]. These three WMSs have existed in their respective cultures for millennia before the development ofnatural science-based, conventional medicine [3, 16, 17, 19, 21-23,30]. Three other WMSs (Homeopathy, Naturopathy, and AnthroposophicMedicine)arecomparativelyyounger( <250 years), although traces of influences by older traditionscan be found [31-33]. Seminal publications appeared forHomeopathyin 1796 [34], for Naturopathyin 1848 [35], andf o rA Mi n1 9 2 5[ 3 6 ] .Th e s et h r e eW M S sw e r efi r s tp r a c t i c e din Central Europe by medical doctors and were furtherdeveloped next to conventional medicine within Westerncultures. Inthecourseofglobalization,allsixWMSshavebecome disseminatedfromtheiroriginalcultureintoothercountriesand regions, sometimes with establishment of \"second cen-ters\" such as for Naturopathy in North America [37] andHomeopathyinIndia[38].Currently,inalmosteverycountry intheworld,oneormoretypesofWMSarepracticed[4]. 3.2.SimilaritiesandDifferences 3.2.1.

In contrast,treatmentintheotherfiveWMSsistoamuchlargerextentmultimodal(Table1). A particular aspect of Naturopathy is the widespread use oftherapy modalities from other WMSs (e.g., Chinese herbsand homeopathic MPs) or from non-WMS CAM (e.g., foodsupplements) rintheuseo fo nespecifictypeofWMPs(Homeopathy). TCM and Ayurveda have long traditions of mainly oral transmission of WMS knowledge and experience, predatingtheclassicaltexts[16,26].4 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicineTable1:Overviewofsixwholemedicalsystems.

WMPs used Therapies. The major differences between WMSs and singlecomponentCAMinterventionsareasfollows: (i) Some single component (or fixed combination of) CAMinterventionscanbeconceptualizedwithinthe conventional biomedical paradigm: for example, an u m b e ro fv i t a m i n sa r eu s e da sC A Mt h e r a p y ,w h i l etheir purported pharmacological effects are concep-tualized on the levels of cell biology or biochemistry.In contrast, WMS interventions are not so easilyunderstoodontheselevels(althoughthedifferenceisnotabsolute[5]). (ii) Single component CAM interventions can be proto- colled for specific conventional and/or CAM indica-tions,whereasthisisnotthecaseforWMSinterven-tions. (iii) Individualized, multimodal CAM treatment entails the combination of several treatment modalities thatare tailored to the needs of the individual patient.When this happens within a WMS, all treatmentmodalities are understood within and derived fromone conceptual framework, leading to a uniformtreatmentapproach.Whendiversesinglecomponent CAMinterventionsarecombined,auniformconcep- tual understanding is often not possible, leading toeclecticism. 3.2.3. Similarities and Differences between WMSs and the System of Conventional Biomedicine. The main similarities between WMSs and some developments in conventional medicineareasfollows: (i) Thedevelopmentofapersonalizedmedicine/individ- ualizationapproachin additionto thecurrentmain-streamprotocolledapproach[44,45] (ii) The use and role of professional judgment in some domains of clinical practice (e.g., interpretation of radiographs)[45,46] (iii) Theincreasinguseofcomplexinterventions[47-49] (iv) System approaches in diagnostics and therapy systems epigenetics, notion that RCTs are not applicable everywhere [57,58]withashifttowardsmorepragmatictrials[45,48,58,59]andotherstudytypes[48,60] (ix) The notion that conducting clinical studies for mul- tiple clinical conditions and their respective diversetherapy options has its limitations, due to excessivecomplexityandprohibitivecosts (x) Theincreasingroleofpatientpreferencesandpatient autonomy (xi) The real-world situation that, in many medical fields (e.g., paediatric surgery, emergency medicine, andvaccination), RCT-based practice conventional medicine entailssomekey,interdependentfactors: (i) Legislation:therapyprovidersandWMPs (ii) Education: practitioners of the two integrating med- ical systems that have to work together for a periodof years to build up experience and confidence ineffectiveteamwork (iii) Quality standards for WMS treatment: training of providers, delivery of treatment, and pharmaceuticalqualityofWMPs (iv) ScientificresearchonthesafetyandefficacyofWMP interventions (v) Infrastructureandfinancialresources Regarding scientific research and quality benchmarking, therearespecificissuespertainingtotheinherentpropertiesofWMSs: (i) Ontological, epistemological, and methodological issues understanding andassessmentofWMSs (ii) Specificissuesrelevantfordiagnostics,therapydeliv- ery,andoutcomeassessmentinclinicalpractice Theseissuesarediscussedinthefollowingsubsections. 3.3.1.Legislation,QualityStandards,Research,Infrastructures, and Resources. Of paramount for integration is therecognitionofWMSsin legislation ,inparticular (i) recognitionofWMStherapyproviders,theirtraining schoolsanddiplomas; (ii) regulatory on establishing quality stan- dards: (i) For therapy providers (e.g., WHO benchmarks Europ\u00b4een de Normalisation] standards for health care provision by medical doctors with additionalqualificationinHomeopathy[64]) (ii) For the pharmaceutical quality of WMPs (e.g., the AnthroposophicPharmaceuticalCodex[41]). Scientific and societal recognition also depends on high-quality evidence for efficacy/effectiveness and safety ofWMPsandnonmedicationtreatmentinWMSs;hence,inte-grationalsoincludesthefunding,conduct,andpublicationofscientificresearch studiesinordertogenerateanddisseminate such evidence. In order to promote quality standards andscientific research, infrastructures andfinancial resources are needed. Insomecountriesthesetasksaregivennationalpriority: for example, the Government of India supports research,education,qualitystandardization,andinfrastructurebuild-ingforsevenWMSs(AYUSH:Ayurveda,Yoga,Naturopathy,Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy, and Sowa-Rigpa), since 2004withinthenewlyestablishedMinistryofAYUSH[65]. One example of infrastructure building is establishing Integrative Medicine centers in academic hospitals, wherespecific WMS modalities (not necessarily the entire WMS)are developed, applied, and tested. This model has beenimplemented in the USA and organized in the AcademicConsortium for Integrative Medicine & Health, based onfour pillars: (1) the horizontal relationship between thedoctor/therapist(coach)andthepatient(coproducer);(2)the active role of the patient in prevention (lifestyle), wellbeing, a n dt h e r a p ya n dh e a l i n gp r o c e s s e s ;( 3 )t h eu s eo fe v i d e n c e - based safe and effective conventional and complementary therapies;and(4)theuseofhealingenvironments[66]. 3.3.2. Fundamental Ontological Aspects. All studied WMSs take anonatomistic, holistic ontological position towards the natureofreality.Thismeansthattheyallconceptualize,each in a different form, in addition to material elements and forces,theexistenceofnonmaterialforcesworkinginnaturea n dm a n ,w h i c ha l s op l a yar o l ei nh e a l t ha n dd i s e a s e .F o rexample,acentralconceptofTCMisQi,avitalenergyorlifef o r c et h a tm o v e si nt h eb o d yt h r o u g has y s t e mo fp a t h w a y s calledmeridians[16].SimilarconceptsarefoundinAyurveda (\"prana\" [67]) and Unani (\"arwah\" or vital spirit [29]).

Homeopathy conceptualizesthenonmaterialeffectsofhighpotentizedsubstances[21]andalsoNaturopathyisbasedonholisticandvitalisticprinciples [22]. Conceptual and Epistemological Aspects. In line with the nonatomistic, holistic ontological position, central con- cepts of WMS are holistic. Concepts of the human beingemphasize the wholeness and complexity of the humanbeing [68]; its emergent, nonlinear dynamic, and epigeneticproperties;anditsabilityofself-organizationandadaptationas a network system [69]. Health is conceptualized as theability to balance and actively restore the wholeness ofEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 7 the human being [5]. Within the WMS practice methods, there is an essential role for intuition and expert knowledgein diagnostics and decision-making [45], while treatmentalso takes into account context factors and the uniqueness, constitution, and complexity of the individual [45, 70]. 3.3.4. Methodological Aspects. Ar e v i e wo nc l i n i c a la n d epidemiological research in CAM [48] demonstrates that, for research on therapy effects, there is consensus thatboth efficacy and effectiveness studies have their own place, validity, and importance. Some authors argue that efficacy research should be prioritised over effectiveness research tolegitimisetheuseofCAMandtohelptoincreaseacceptance.Otherauthorsstatethatefficacyresearchtoexaminespecificeffects should not be undertaken until overall effectiveness of the therapy in question is demonstrated, in order to prevent misuse of scarce resources. This discussion also reflects different opinions on the importance and value of specific and nonspecific effects within the whole of clinicalpractice.Anintegrativeresearchapproachhasbeendescribedassimultaneousresearchintomechanismsandoveralleffec-tivenessofCAMtreatments.Contemporarymethodologicalstandards of medical research can be applied to CAMresearch, but it might be necessary to adapt the researchdesignsinsomeareas,inordertoaccountforthecomplexityofCAMinterventions[72].CAM-specificchallengesmustbeaddressed, such as the problem of strict standardization ofdiverse treatments and study participants leading to lack ofexternal validity.

Outcomes should be broader than symptom reduction alone,theyshouldcontainseverallevelsofthewholehuman being,includingphysical,mental,spiritual,andsocialfactors[70]. Health economic evaluation of CAM treatments wasseen as particularly relevant in modern healthcare. Researchinto the mechanisms of placebo, context, or meaning effectswerealsoseenasimportanttodetermineappropriatecontrolgroups and their respective explanatory power, in orderto explain potentially contradictory study results and tomaximizetheseeffectsinclinicalpractice.Newerevaluationm o d e l ss u c ha sp r o g r a mt h e o r y ,t h et h e o r yo n\" t h em e c h -anisms that mediate between the delivery (and receipt) ofth ep r ogra ma n dth eem er g en ceo fth eo u t co m eso fin t er es t \"[75, 76], encompass a wide range of health-related changes that include process aspects, such as the emergence of newmeanings and understanding during or after treatment, aswellaslongertermchangesinhealth,wellbeing,andhealth-relatedcompetencesandbehavior[77]. Anotherproposedmodelisa\"reversedresearchstrategy\" for assessing CAM, starting with studies of the context,paradigms, philosophical understanding, and utilization,then subsequently the safety status of the whole system,comparative effectiveness of the whole system, and specificefficacy of components, and finally the underlying biolog-ical mechanisms [49, 78]. Other, expressly nonhierarchicalmodels include a circular information synthesis of differentevidenceforms[45,60]andan\"evidencehouse\"[79]. 3.3.5. Clinical Practice Aspects. Main topics with regard to WMS practice methods pertain to the development of wholesystemdiagnosticsandinterventions;thedevelopmentand application of quality control systems for individualizeddiagnostics and treatment and the use of multidisciplinarycomplexinterventions[80];theroleofprotocols,guidelines,andexpertknowledgeinclinicalpracticesofawholesystemapproach [81]; and the use of double (conventional andWMS)diagnoses. A WMS diagnosis is a diagnosis on the level of the individual patient and is system-based. In practices whereWMSisintegratedwithconventionalmedicine,wethereforefind double diagnoses. Diagnostics on the individual andsystem level often includes pattern recognition methodswhich require interrelated expert knowledge, intuition, andsystemthinkingskills[82]. InWMStherapythefocusisonthesickpatientinhisor her whole complexity, including physical, mental, spiritual,and social factors. These are interconnected and need tobe addressed in total and on multiple levels. The reper-toire of CAM treatment is often multimodal and complex,and its application highly individualized. CAM treatmentsand counselling are provided as integrative systems withinteracting components. Accordingly, the effects of complexapproaches are often larger than the sum of the compo-nents' effects. WMS therapy aims to support and stimulateautoprotectiveandsalutogeneticpotentials(self-healingandself-regulatory abilities), mostly with the active cooperationof the patient or of his/her organism. WMS practices alsorequire a good patient-practitioner interaction (therapeuticrelationship) and cocreation of the patient in varying ther-apeutic contexts [45]. Clinical evaluation includes patient-determined outcomes as well as patient satisfaction [70];notably, these outcome measures are also becoming increas- inglyusedinevaluationofconventionaltreatments. 3.3.6. Quality and Clinical Safety of WMPs. Regarding the pharmaceutical quality and clinical safety of WMPs, there is a difference in the historical development of the older and newerWMSs.8 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine In the 20th century, homeopathic and anthroposophic MPshavebeenmarketedinEuropeancountriessuchasAus- tria, France, Germany, and Switzerland as drugs, manufac-tured according to Good Manufacturing Practice standards,and subject to modern drug regulation including pharma-covigilance. Toxicologically relevant starting materials (e.g., aconite and cinnabar) are highly diluted according to safety requirementsofEuropeanregulations[83].AdversereactionstotheseMPsareinfrequentandusuallyofmildtomoderateseverity; anaphylactic reactions occur but are very rare [40,84,85]. In contrast, MPs from Chinese, Ayurveda, and Unani medicine have historically been produced for local use. Inmodern times, industrial-scale production has developedwith less rigorous quality control, and MPs have been reg-ulated as food or food supplements or have been importedfor use without regulation. Some WMPs have been asso-ciated with repeated, severe adverse reactions, includingliver and kidney toxicity (sometimes fatal) [86-88], heavymetalpoisoning[89-93],epilepticseizures[94],andadrenalsuppression from undeclared addition of corticosteroids toherbal products [90]. There are further concerns regard-ing environmental contaminations (e.g., air pollution, soilcontaminations),cultivationpractices(e.g.,pesticides,fungi-cides, microorganisms, (e.g., microorganisms, endotoxins), and inappropriateuse [95, 96]. In order to overcome these problems, phar-macovigilance systems have been established in the mainproducing countries of Chinese, Ayurvedic, and Unani MPs[97, 98], and there are considerable efforts to improve the qualitystandardsfortheseWMPs[99,100]. 3.4.MismatchesandAspectsNeedingAttention 3.4.1. Mismatches. Currently, based on the described are mismatches between the current scien- tific empirical (EBM) and theoretical (biomedical model)demands and the properties and specificity of WMSs. Wedescribe these mismatches here by means of the exampleof WMPs, with the demands and their application in drugregulation on the one hand and WMPs and the inherentpropertiesofWMSontheotherhand.Themainmismatchesareasfollows: (1) WMPs are insufficiently tested because they are not in line with conventional interests and biomedicalmodels. (2) WMPs are generally handled as standardized con- ventional medicinal product (CMP) interventions,whereas they should also be handled as part of acomplexintervention. (3)WMPsarehandledasCMPs,thatis,symptomreduc- ing, fighting disease therapy, whereas they should behandled as a curative, health promotion therapy thatsupportstheself-healingabilitiesoftheorganism. (4) WMPs are tested for conventional indications based on group-oriented taxonomy and diagnostics,whereas they should be tested for individualizedWMPindications. (5) WMPs are assumed to have specific biochemical effectslikeCMPshave,butWMPtherapyisdirectedat higher levels, aiming at the regulation and har-monizing (e.g., Dosha balancing in Ayurveda) ofoverarching, complex physiological processes, andthetransformationofphysiologicalandpsychologicalprocesses and capacities into more mature and inte-gratedstates(Schad,2008;Simon,2009). (6) WMPs are often judged on efficacy by regulatory authorities as new CMPs, whereas they should alsobe regarded as part of a traditional WMS with long-standing use, developed following a reverse al., 2007; Kienle etal.,2011). Themainconsequencesofthesemismatchesareasfollows: (1) Thedominanceofthebiomedicalmodelhasresulted in an a priori negative image and rejection of WMPsby scientists of conventional biomedicine, whereby,seenfromareductionist,mechanisticposition,effectsof WMPs are regarded as mere nonspecific, contexteffects,notworthyofseriousscientificscrutiny. (2) As a consequence of this attitude of rejection, there is an underrepresentation of WMS scientists in aca-demic institutions and scarce public funding of aca-demicWMPresearch. (3) Many WMPs are not tested in clinical research and canthereforenotobtainordinarymarketingauthori-sation. (4) WMPs are most often not tested according to their theoretical higher order, system level effects but aretested in conventional RCTs with a single productapproach.ThereforetheprecisionofthetestedWMPtreatment is decreased, with an increased high riskof \"false-negative results\" (meaning: in reality thetreatment has beneficial effects but these are notcapturedintheresearchstudy). (5) WMPs often do not appear in guidelines for treat- mentofspecificconventionalindicationssincemanyWMPs are not in line with mainstream biomedicaltheories, are not tested in clinical research, and arenotpartoftheexpertknowledgeofthedevelopersofconventionaltreatmentguidelines. This development is not restricted to WMPs: there is anincreasing call for excluding all WMS modalities fromhealthcare and for stopping the development of IntegrativeMedicine, since many WMS interventions are perceived tolackaplausiblescientificefficacymodelandbecauserelevantresults of clinical studies are lacking, for reasons describedabove. However, as described previously, there are also positive examples of the integration of WMSs and conventionalmedicine in practice, examples of high-quality evidence ofEvidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 9 specific effects of WMS treatment for conventional indi- cations, and WMSs theoretical models that appear to becontent-wiseinlinewiththesystemsapproachinscienceandmedicine(seeIntroduction). 3.4.2. Aspects That Need Attention to Promote the Integration of the Conventional Medical System and the WMSs. From this overview of the differences between the conventional medical system and the WMSs, a number of issues can bededucedthatshouldbedealtwithinscienceandclinicalandregulatorypractice,inordertoovercomethedifferencesand facilitatetheintegrationprocessesofthebestofbothworlds. Futureresearchandscientificdiscussionshould the tenability nonatomistic holistic of within the debate, issuestoovercomeintheintegrationprocess. (ii) Conceptualandepistemologicalissues (a) Futureresearchandscientificdiscussionshould focusondevelopingandtestingtheoriesthataresystem- and complexity-oriented and that are compatible with both WMS and conventional medicine. (b) Specific theories that conceptually may bridge the two approaches should be further studied:theories of health, disease, healing [101]; indi- vidualizationindiagnosticsandtreatment;and healthpromotion. (iii) (2) takingintoaccountthecomplexityofCAM interventionsandtheroleofexpertknowl-edge, intuition, and ofdiagnosticsandtherapies; (3) the health economic evaluation of CAM treatments; (4) the mechanisms of placebo, context, or meaningeffects[102].

(iv) Regulatoryissues (a) Regulatory frameworks must be modified in ordertomatchthespecificfeaturesofWMPs. (b) New conceptualizations regarding benefit-risk assessment, research synthesis from differenttypes of evidence (not just RCTs), and theevaluation of WMPs are needed. This in linewiththeopinionoftheEUcommissionthathasacknowledged the need for appropriate regula-tionalsoofWMPs[103]. 3.4.3.LackofEvidenceofSpecificTreatmentEffectsandPresci-entific or Unscientific Theories. Whereas the main argument of many people from conventional medicine is that integra- tionofWMSsandconventionalmedicineisunacceptabledue toanassumedlackofevidenceofspecificeffectsfromWMStreatmentandbecauseofallegedprescientificorunscientifictheories,weherediscusstheseissuesinmoredetail. Apart from the fact that there are some good quality studies demonstrating specific effects of a single WMStherapy for a conventional indication [104], the describedfeaturesofWMSapproachesdemonstratethatWMStherapymost often is aiming at system effects and at restoringbalances rather than symptom reduction and often containsdifferent treatments as part of a complex intervention. Thissituation makes it often difficult to test one single, protocol-based treatment for a conventional indication. If this typeo fe v i d e n c ew o u l db em a n d a t o ry ,t h ep r e c i s i o no ft h et e s t e dtreatmentwouldbedecreased,withanincreasedhighriskof\"false-negativeoutcomes\"(meaning:inrealitythetreatmenthasbeneficialeffectsbutthesearenotcapturedintheresearchstudy). In addition, it would lead to a feasibility bias againstWMSs. This was the reason for the development of thepreviously described different \"reversed research strategy\"for assessing CAM [49] and the model of nonhierarchical,circular information synthesis of different evidence forms[60]. With regard to the theories, WMSs theories are (nonatomistic) holistic and not reductionistic and thereforeoften regarded as prescientific or unscientific. However,the current situation is that throughout different fields ofresearch, scientists increasingly question the ability of purereductionist theories to describe and explain the complexityofbiologicalorganizations[51].Therefore,newtheories(e.g.,systems biology, emergence, and epigenetics) originatingfrom the research fields of the biological complexity inorganisms and the genome project demonstrate a shift fromreductionist towards more holistic concepts. [21] To ouropinion, based on these shifts in science, more opennessand acceptance towards (nonatomistic) holistic theories iswarranted.10 Evidence-BasedComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine 4. Discussion There is an increasing need for a worldwide profes- sional integration of conventional medicine and tradi- tional/complementary whole medical systems. However, in many Western countries, the integration is perceived by conventionalmedicineasproblematicandnotacceptable.We thereforereviewedtheliteratureonthefeaturesofWMSs,the similarities and differences between conventional medicine and WMSs, and future scientific and clinical practice issues thatshouldbedealtwithinordertopromotetheintegrationprocess. KeyfactorsfortheintegrationofWMSsandconventional medicine are as follows: legal and regulatory frameworksf o rt h e r a p yp r o v i d e r sa n dW M P s ;q u a l i t ys t a n d a r d sf o rt h e training of therapy providers, the delivery of treatment, and the pharmaceutical quality of WMPs; high-quality scientific researchonthesafetyandefficacyofWMSinterventions;and adequate infrastructure and financial resources in order tocarryoutthesetasks. For scientific research and quality WMSs: ontological, epistemological, and methodological issues relevant to the overall understanding and assessment and issues relevant to diagnostics, therapy delivery, and outcomeassessmentinclinicalpractice.Manyoftheseissues are as yet unresolved, with contradictory positions among scientists and stakeholders of conventional biomedicine and WMSs, respectively, and with mismatches for resource allo-cationanddrugregulation. Themaincontributionofthisarticleisthatitwillprovide (more) overview and clarity on this topic for both WMSsand conventional medicine. It will give objective input for rational discussions on the integration topic. In addition, it willsupportorganizationsintheirpreparationanddecision- makingduringtheintegrationprocess. A limitation of the article is that we did not include all WMSs, for example, Yoga medicine, osteopathy, Campo, or WMSs from Africa or South America. Also we did not employ all possible search terms, for example, Ayurvedic (in addition to Ayurveda). A topic that is beyond the scope of this article is that we did not discuss the (supposed) lack of evidence on specific effects of WMS treatments andt h e( s u p p o s e d )l a c ko ft e s t e dt h e o r i e so fW M S s[ 1 5 ]i n depth.However,wedescribedthefundamental(ontological, epistemological,andmethodological)underlyingdifferencesbetween WMSs and conventional medicine that are related to these issues (evidence of specific effects and lack of tested theories) and made clear why both sides have different perceptionsontheseissues. Future research activities not only should be directed at the\"forefrontissues\"ofqualityassuranceandgeneratingthe necessary data on safety and efficacy/effectiveness of WMS interventionsbutalsoshouldaddressthemorefundamental (ontological, epistemological, and methodological) overcome the differences between WMSs and conventionalmedicine.
