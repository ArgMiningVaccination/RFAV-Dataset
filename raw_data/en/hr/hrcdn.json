Fast Facts November 2022 Page 3 HealthPartners policy regarding financial incentives It is the policy of HealthPartners that utilization review decisions are made based only on appropriate ness of care, service and existence of coverage. Financial incentives, if any, that are offered by HealthPartners (or any entity that contracts with HealthPartners to provide utilization management services) to individuals or entities involved in making utilization management decisions will not encourage decisions that result in underutilization or inappropriate restrictions of and/or barriers to care and services. This means that HealthPartners and entities contracting with HealthPartners to provide utilization management services will not specifically reward, hire, promote, compensate, retain or terminate practitioners or other individuals conducting utilization review based upon the likelihood or perceived likelihood that t he individual will support or tend to support the denial or benefits. If you have any additional questions, please contact Susan Gunderson at 952- 883-5576 Reimbursement at Observation Level of Care for Specified Diagnos es The HealthPartners Reimbursement at Observation Level of Care for Specified Diagnos es policy is being updated with new diagnosis codes and additional applicable products effective 1/1/2023. Please refer to the Reimbursement at Observation Level of Care for Spe cified Diagnos es policy for a complete list of diagnoses requiring supporting clinical documentation of the inpatient admission. The specified diagnosis will be considered an observation stay and will be paid as an observation visit unless clinical information is submitted supporting the inpatient admission. Failure to submit the supporting clinical documen tation once requested may result in denial to provider liability. Providers will be held financially responsible and may not bill members for the cost of service when the supporting documentation is not provided to support the admission. This policy is applicable to all members who have HealthPartners Commercial, Medicaid and Medicare Advantage insurance as their primary coverage. Vaccine hesitancy training modules available TRUSTED MESSENGERS CHW Solutions , the Minnesota Department of Health, the National Resource Center for Refugees, Immigrants, and Migrants (NRC -RIM ), and others have collaborated to create on -demand training modules for c ommunity health workers (CHWs), public health professionals, community groups, nurses and c linicians. This training uses excerpts from the Trusted Messenger documentary , which highlights how a diverse ensemble of healthcare professionals works to overcome COVID -19 vaccine hesitancy in marginalized communities in Minnesota. T hese excerpts are combined with both facilitation and discussion guides to support the various audiences in their efforts to have effective and compassionate conversations with patients and loved ones about health- related topics. Materials include Spanish ver sions for CHW s and community groups. The pandemic has confirmed for us what we already knew: that trusted messengers have incredible influence in their communities, and it is worth the investment of time and patience to be able to have effective conversat ions with others. The lessons learned through this training can be applied to not just COVID -19, but other public health measures around routine vaccinations, infectious diseases and other health topics.

Fast Facts November 2022 Page 5 Mandatory reporting for pregnant women In July 2021 changes to the mandatory reporting laws in Minnesota took effect in an effort to improve access to prenatal care for people at risk of substance use. As of July 2021, provider s in health care and social services who are actively caring for pregnant people are not required to report the use of controlled substances. This change has caused a lot of confusion in the medical community. If you would like to hear about how this change has been operationalized in some settings or have questions about this change, the December 13th Hennepin Healthcare ECHO session about Perinatal Substance Use will focus on this topic. The discussion will be led by Drs Cresta Jones and Katie Thorsness , and is co -sponsored by Hennepin Healthcare, MN Medical Association and the Medicaid health plans Healthy Start PIP Collaborative.

Fast Facts November 2022 Page 6 Fraud, waste and abuse Fraud, waste and abuse in healthcare ultimately makes care and coverage more expensive and less safe. HealthPartners is committed to preventing, detecting and reporting fraud, waste and abuse (FWA), and conducting business in compliance with all applicable federal and state statutes, regulations and laws. Clinicians are also responsible for exercising due diligence in the detection and prevention of fraud, waste and abuse in accordance with our Fraud, Waste and Abuse (FWA) policies. Fraud, waste and abuse in healthcare can take many forms, which can make it hard to spot. Health care fraud can be committed by medical providers, patients and others who intentionally deceive the health care system to receive unlawful benefits or payments. Here are a few of the most common types: Billing and coding fraud, including o Billing a payer for services or supplies that weren't provided o Ordering or providing services or supplies that aren't medically necessary o Up-coding or billing for more expensive services tha n those that were provided Telehealth schemes, such as kickbacks for referrals for unnecessary testing and medical equipment COVID -19 related fraud, which may include ordering unnecessary COVID testing in order to steal and/or sell a patient's information Fraud involving prescription drugs, such as: o Creating or using forged prescriptions o Drug diversion, or the illegal distribution or abuse of prescript ion drugs o Doctor shopping, or visiting multiple providers to get prescriptions for controlled substances, or getting prescriptions from medical offices that engage in unethical practices Reporting fraud, waste and abuse is everyone's right and responsibil ity. To report suspected fraud, waste or abuse, you may call the HealthPartners Integrity and Compliance Hotline at 1 -866-444- 3493, or the HealthPartners Fraud and Abuse Hotline at 952- 883- 5099, or send an e -mail to reportfraud@healthpartners.com. Please review the Preventing, Detecting & Reporting Fraud, Waste & Abuse policy and share it with others within your organization who may need to be aware of this information. Feel free to call Steve Bunde, Health Plan Compliance Officer, at 952- 883- 6541 if you have any questions or concerns. Spam and phishing emails Cybercrime in health care is on the rise , and cybercriminals are using phishing emails to target providers. Email scams come in different forms and can be tricky to spot. Phishing emails masquerade as trustworthy messages and try to trick you into doing what fraudsters want. Phishing emails may pressure you to open/download files, click email links or attachments, and/or enter sensitive information into a website. When phishing emails are successful, attackers can steal money, usernames and passwords to access accounts, or infect computer networks - damaging an organization's ability to provide care and services. Rest assured HealthPartners emails come from the email domain of \"@HealthPartners.com.\" If you hover over links in emails from HealthPartners, they'll lead to HealthPartners.com. If you ever have questions about a HealthPartners communication, reach out to your HealthPartners representative to verify the authenticity of a communication. Fast Facts November 2022 Page 7 SPOT THE SPAM: ASK WHO, WHAT AND WHY? WHO Who's the sender? Is the sender familiar? Do es the sender's email address match the sender's name? NOTE - Look closely at the spelling in the email address and domain, along with spelling in the email message. Scammers can be tricky and may know you're likely to receive emails from HealthPartners an d may try to replicate our name and email messages. If a sender's name or email address don't match previous communications, use extra caution with the message. WHAT What's the email trying to get you to do: Does the email contain a link or attachment? Is the link URL (hover over the link with your mouse) different from the email topic or sender? Is what they're asking strange? If the answer to all these questions i s yes, use extra caution before taking any action with the email. Phishing emails can have a topic that doesn't make sense for the sender or creates a sense of urgency, anxiety, loss or is pushy. They also can leave out details or sounds too good to be true . Hovering your cursor over links may show a different website address than the topic or sender of the email. If the email appears phishy, do not interact with it. WHY Why are you receiving the email? Is it expected? Does it sound reasonable? For example: Do you receive emails or notifications as authorized contact or delegate for your organization? Did you authorize an action on HealthPartners provider account? You can protect your organization and the people you serve by spotting and not acting on phishing emails .

The CDC Guideline s address patient -centered clinical practices including conducting th orough assessments, considering all possible treatments, closely monitoring risks, and safely discontinuing opioids. The three main focus areas are: 1. Determining when to initiate or continue opioids for chronic pain Selection of non -pharmacologic therapy (interventions such as exercise, multidisciplinary rehabilitation, mind -body interventions) . Selection selected antidepressants anticonvulsants), or opioid therapy. Establishment of treatment goals . Discussion of risks and benefits of therapy with patients . 2. Opioid selection, dosage, duration, follow -up and discontinuation Selection of immediate -release or extended -release and long -acting opioids . Dosage considerations. Calculating the total daily dose of opioids helps identify patients who may benefit from closer monitoring, reducing or tapering opioids, prescribing of naloxone, or othe r measures to reduce risk of overdose. MME conversion factors are being updated.

Link to C DC's opioid guideline overview HealthPartners utilizes the following Pharmacy Opioid Safety programs for Medicare Opioid Cumulative Dosing Program (OCDP) This program will block an incoming claim that puts a member's daily Morphine Milligram Equivalent (MME) greater than or equal to a soft -stop (pharmacy over - rideable) threshold of 90 MME across a single or multiple opioid -containing claims and/or hard -stop threshold for incoming claims with a cumulative MME greater than or equal to 200 MME. Duplicative Long -Acting Opioid Therapy Program This program will identify and deny concurrent use of long -acting opioids when there is any overlap in days ' supply. A concurrent or duplicative long -acting opioid drug is defined as another long -acting opioid product with a different active ingredient. Opioid Na\u00efve Day Supply Limitation This program will limit initial opioid prescription fills for the treatment of acute pain to no more than a seven days ' supply for a member with no opioid history within a defined lookback period. The lookback period is 60 days. Opioid -Benzodiazepine Concurrent Use Program This program will identify and deny concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids when there is any overlap in days ' supply. The program works bi -directionally (i.e., triggered by an incoming claim for an opioid with concurrent use of benzodiazepine or vice versa). Opioid -Buprenorphine Concurrent Use Limitation This program will identify and deny concurrent use of opioids when there is any overlap in days ' supply with a pre -existing claim for buprenorphine for medication - assisted treatment (MAT). The edit works uni -directionally. This means it will only soft-stop analgesic opioids when members are currently taking buprenorphine for MAT.
