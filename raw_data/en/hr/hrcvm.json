Yes, yes and yes! Holistic Wellness is increasing in both awareness and demand, however it is still a relatively new industry. In 2018, the Holistic Wellness market was growing faster than the average and valued world-wide at $4 trillion. Many people today are aware and proactive about all aspects of their health, and are willing to invest in lifestyle-based strategies to improve themselves. One reason for this is that we are seeing an aging population who is living longer, yet suffering with chronic conditions that conventional medicine can treat on a physical level; holistic wellness bridges the gap to address the mental and spiritual byproducts or roots of the ailment, which could be things such as shame, poor sleep, a lack of confidence, or anxiety. This feels like what I'm called to do, yet it seems scary! Is that a common feeling? Our founder, KC Miller, also offers these words: \"What if you did whatever was placed in front of you? Understand that when the Divine gives you these downloads, when you get these wild ideas, that is actually your soul saying 'I'm ready! I'm ready to do what I was placed on earth to do'. I believe our intuition is actually our soul's voice. And when we hear our soul, we have two decisions: We do it, not fully knowing all the steps along the way, or we deny our soul's urging and we will circle and circle and circle until we make a new decision. We will go down the path of feeling disappointed in ourselves, or finally we will take a deep breath and we will step in the unknowing - knowing that we are following our divine spirit path.. What I can tell you is that I didn't know how to do this [create Southwest Institute of Healing Arts], and I probably wasn't qualified other than to the Divine. And the Divine said, 'she'll be the one that we'll use...because she's willing\"...Please don't doubt yourself. If you're getting those soul messages, go with it. You are qualified!\" I'm ready!
