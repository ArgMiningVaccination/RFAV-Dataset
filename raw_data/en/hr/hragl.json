This audit satisfies state agencies' audit requirements under the federal Single Audit Act of 1984, as amended, and of the federal Office of Management and Budget Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). The audit also assists us in fulfilling our audit responsibilities under s. 13.94, Wis. Stats. Our report contains the auditor's reports on internal control and compliance related to financial reporting and federal program administration, and our audit op inion on the State of Wisconsin's Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) . In fiscal year (FY) 2021-22, state agencies administered $20.2 billion in federal financial assistance, including $5.9 billion in assistance expended as a result of the public health emergency and separately identified in the SEFA. We tested internal controls and compliance with la ws and regulations for 22 federal programs that were selected for review using risk-based assessment cr iteria established by the federal government and specified in Uniform Guidance. We qualified our opinion on compliance related to certain requirements for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program. We made 64 recommendations to improve administration of federal programs and to address deficiencies in in ternal controls over fina ncial reporting. We also identified $1.3 million of questioned costs that stat e agencies charged inappropriately to federal funds. We followed up on the status of corrective actions to address audit findings we reported in our FY 2020-21 single audit report (report 22-5). The fe deral government will work with state agencies to resolve the new and continuing concerns we identified. We appreciate the courtesy and cooperation extended to us by state agency staff during our audit. Agency responses to individual findings are included within each chapter. As required by Uniform Guidance, agency corrective action plans to address these findings are included separately in the auditee section of this report. Respectfully submitted, Joe Chrisman State Auditor JC/CS/ss 3 Wisconsin state agencies administ ered a total of $20.2 billion in federal financial assistance during fiscal year (FY) 2021-22 including $17.4 billion in cash assistance, $2.7 billion in noncash assistance, and $107.8 million in outstanding loan ba lances. This total also includes $5.6 billion in federal financial assistance the State expended related to the public health emergency, and th at it separately identified in the State of Wisconsin's Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA). As a condition of receiving federal funds, state agencies must meet the audit requirements of the federal Single Audit Act of 1984, as amended, and of the federal Office of Management and Budget Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). We performed our FY 2021-22 audit at the request of state agencies that administered federal financial assistance and to assist us in fulfilling our audit responsibilities under s. 13.94, Wis. Stats. We focused our audit on the internal controls over 22 selected federal programs and tested compliance with laws and regula tions related to these programs. In performing this audit, we were required by federal rules to: render an opinion on the State's basic financial statements; issue a report on the State's internal control and compliance related to financial reporting; and issue a report on the State's compliance with requirements applicable to each major program, on its internal control over compliance, and on its SEFA. Introduction State agencies administered $20.2 billion in federal financial assistance in FY 2021-22. 4 INTRODUCTION Our opinion on the State's FY 2021-22 financial statements was included in the State's Annual Comprehensiv e Financial Report (ACFR), which was issued by the Wisconsin Depart ment of Administration (DOA) in December 2022 and is available on DOA's website. The other required auditor's reports, accompanied by each agency's response to our findings and its corrective action plans, are included in this single audit report. This single audit report, alon g with other required information, is required to be submitted to the federal government under Uniform Guidance. Federal Programs In FY 2021-22, the State administered 18 federal programs or clusters with expenditures greater than $200.0 million. Uniform Guidance requires that certain federal programs be grouped into clusters, combined for federal reporting purposes, and audited as one overall program. The 18 largest programs or clusters accounted for 88.6 percent of the $20.2 billion in federal financial assistance state agencies administered in FY 202 1-22, as shown in Table 1. In FY 2021-2 2, 18 programs accounted for 88.6 percent of the $20.2 billion in federal financial assistance state agencies administered.

Uniform Guidance categorizes federal programs as \"type A\" (large programs or clusters) and \"type B\" (smaller programs or clusters). For the State, type A programs or clusters had expenditures of $30.2 million or more in federal funds. The type A and B programs or clusters selected for audit were those determined to be subject to a higher risk of noncompliance based on the risk factors established by Uniform Guidance. As shown in Table 3, our FY 2021-22 audit focused on 16 type A programs or clusters and 6 type B programs or clusters. These programs or clusters were administ ered primarily by 12 state agencies and accounted for 58.9 percent of the $20.2 billion in federal financial assistance administered by state agencies. We also followed up on the status of corrective actions agencies took to address the audit findings we repo rted in our FY 2020-21 single audit report (report 22-5). Our FY 2021-22 si ngle audit report also includes those findings that are required to be reported under Uniform Guidance, such as findings related to the audit of the State's financial statements. In addition, we noted certain additional internal control or compliance matters that we conveyed to agency management in separate communications. Our audit focused on 22 federal programs or clusters administered by state agencies in FY 2021-22.

As shown in Figure 1, total federal financial assistance has increased since FY 2018-19 as a result of additional federal financial assistance to address the effects of the public health emergency. Figure 1 State of Wisconsin Total Federal Financial Assistance1 (in billions) 1Includes cash assistance; noncash assistance, such as food commodities; and outstanding loan balances. 2Includes $3.4 billion of federal financial assistance related to the public health emergenc y, and separatel y identified in the SEFA. 3Includes adjustment of prior-year total federal financial assistance due to transfers in FY 2021-22 of prior-year expenditures. 4Includes $6.1 billion of federal financial assistance related to the public health emergency, and separately identified in the SEFA. 5Includes $5.9 billion of federal financial assistance related to the public health emergency, and separately identified in the SEFA. INTRODUCTION 11 In March 2020, the federal government and the State declared a public health emergency in response to CO VID-19. In response to the public health emergency, the federal governme nt enacted legislation, including: Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020; Families First Coronavirus Response Act; Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act; Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021; Continued Assistance Act of 2020; Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 (CRRSAA); and American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021. Under these and other federal laws, the State received additional federal funding for certain existing programs or clusters, including UI, as well as funding under new programs, including the CSLFRF program and Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program. In report 22-23, we completed a limited-scope review of how DOA used supplemental federal funds provided in response to the public health emergency. As reported in the SEFA, the State expended $3.4 billion in FY 2019-20, $5.9 billion in FY 2021-22, in federal funding provided to address the public health emergency. The $965.8 million in expenditures report ed for the Medical Assistance (MA) Program was the largest amount of expe nditures reported in the SEFA by the State in FY 2021-22 for the public health emergency. Other programs or clusters that received additional federal funding for the public health emergency as separately identified in the SEFA, are shown in Table 4. In the SEFA , the State reported $5.9 billion in federal funding provided to address the public health emergency during FY 202122. 12 INTRODUCTION Table 4 State of Wisconsin Federal Expenditures Related to the Public Health Emergency1 FY 2021-22 Federal Progra m or Cluster2Agency Expenditures3 Medical Assistance (MA) Program Departmen t of Health Services $ 965,781,721 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Cluster (SNAP)4 Department of Health Services 823,729,307 Education Stabilization Fund (ESF) Department of Public Instruction, University of Wisconsin System 599,904,265 Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (CSLFRF) Department of Administration, Department of Health Services, Department of Revenue 559,178,943 Child Nutrition Cluster4 Department of Public Instruction 505,240,433 Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF)4Department of Administration, Disaster Grants\u2014Public Assistance (Presidentially Decl ared Disasters) Department of Administration, Department of Health Services.

INTRODUCTION 13 Medical Assistance Program The federal Families First Corona virus Response Act provided a temporary 6.2 percent increase in Wisconsin's federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for benefit payments, subject to certain requirements to maintain benefits under the provisions in place as of January 2020. The FMAP is the percentage of MA Program expenditures the federal government will fund for the State. DHS reported an additional $636.6 million in funding under the increased FMAP. In addition, DHS claimed an additional $329.2 million in federal funding under Section 9817 of ARPA, which allowed for an additional 10.0 percent FMAP for certain home and community-based services provided to participants during th e period from April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2022. In total, DHS report ed in the SEFA that additional federal funds received as a result of the public health emergency were $965.8 million for the MA Program during FY 2021-22. In August 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) issued a disallowance relate d to Medicaid-related settlements for the MA Program. DHS partially disagreed with the conclusions and issued a formal objection letter in February 2021. In August 2022, DHHS issued a disallowance of $24. 9 million. DHS intends to appeal this decision, as described in Note 3A to the SEFA. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program The federal Families First Coro navirus Response Act granted additional flexibilities under SNAP , also known as FoodShare, that increased benefits provided through emergency allotments received by the State and also increased the number of individuals eligible for benefits. DHS reported $823.7 million in emergency SNAP expenditures related to the public health emergency in the SEFA, including $816.4 million in emergency SNAP benefits, during FY 2021-22. Education Stabilization Fund The ESF was created by the CARES Act, with additional funding provided by CRRSAA and ARPA. The purpose of the fund is to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the effe cts of the public health emergency on education. The ESF consists of four funds: Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund; Emergency Assistance fo r non-Public Schools (EANS) Fund; In F Y 2021-22, DHS reported $965.8 million in additional federal funds received as a result of the public health emergency for the MA Program. DHS reported expending $823.7 million in emergency SNAP funds in FY 2021-22. 14 INTRODUCTION Governor's Emergency Education Relief (GEER) Fund; and Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF). During FY 2021-22, UW System and DPI reported in the SEFA that they expended a combined total of $599.9 million under the ESF. UW System expended ESF funds from the GEER Fund and HEERF. These funds were primarily used by UW institutions to provide grants to students affected by the publ ic health emergency; recover lost revenues as a result of the public health emergency; provide COVID-19 testing; and to cover other costs as sociated with the public health emergency. UW System reported in the SEFA that it expended $257.6 million from the ESF during FY 2021-22. In report 22-25, we completed a limited-scope review of UW System's administration of ESF funding. DPI expended ESF funds from the ESSER Fund, the EANS Fund, and the GEER Fund. These funds we re primarily provided to local educational agencies and private schools to address various needs related to the public health emergen cy, including personal protective equipment, sanitation, technology, and equipment. DPI reported in the SEFA that it expended $342.3 million from the ESF during FY 2021-22. Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds The CSLFRF was created by ARPA to distribute money directly to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. The State was allocated $3.0 billion in CSLFRF funding. In May 2021, the State was advanced $1.5 billion, including $205.8 million to distribute to local governments. In May 2022, the State was advanced the second round of funding, $1.5 billion, including $207.7 million to distribute to local governments. The amounts distributed to local governments are not reported on the State's SEFA. CSLFRF funding included certain stipulations, including that the funds must be used to: respond to the public health emergency or its negative economic effects; respond to the needs of workers performing essential work during the public health emergency; provide government services to the extent revenue losses due to the public health emergency reduced revenues; and make necessary investment s in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure. During FY 2021-22, UW System expended $257.6 million under the ESF. During FY 20 21-22, DPI expended $342.3 million under the ESF. INTRODUCTION 15 Further, federal regulations stipulate that eligible expenditures must be incurred between March 3, 2021, and December 31, 2024, and spent through December 31, 2026. State agencies reported in the SEFA that they expended $559.2 million in funds from the CSLFRF during FY 2021-22. The largest portion of these expenditures were incurred by DHS, DOA, and the Department of Revenue (DOR). In report 22-11 we completed a limited-scope review of the Public Service Commission's use of CSLFRF funding for broadband expansion grants, and in report 22-21 we completed a limited-sc ope review of DOR's use of CSLFRF funding for t he We're All In an d Wisconsin Tomorrow programs. As of February 28, 2023, accounting records show a remaining balance of $1.7 billion, including $35.7 million in interest earnings since inception of the program. As we stated in report 22-26, in December 2022 DOA indicated it had plans for using most of the remaining funds. Child Nutrition Cluster Under the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the State received additional funding for the Child Nutrition Cluster to meet the additional demands and costs to serv e school children. DPI administers the Child Nutrition Cluster, which traditionally funds free and reduced priced meals for children in attendan ce at local schools. In response to the public health emergency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture provided waivers for several program requirements under the Child Nutrition Cluster including a waiver of the operation deadlines for the Summer Food Service Program and National School Lunch Program, which allowed schools to choose which program to operate under through June 30, 2022. During FY 2021-22, DPI reported in the SEFA that it expended $505.2 million in fu nding related to the public health emergency under the Child Nutrition Cluster. Coronavirus Relief Fund The fede ral CARES Act created the CRF to distribute money directly to state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. The federal government advanced $2.0 billion in CRF funds to the State of Wisconsin in April 2020. The State was required to use the funds for expenses that were incurred in response to the public health emergency between March 1, 2020, and December 30, 2020. The federal Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 extended the time for expenditures to be funded by the CRF to December 31, 2021. The federal guidelines allowed expenditures to be record ed through September 30, 2022. CRF funds were expended in various ways to address the public health emergency, including on the statewide COVID-19 testing program; contact tracing; personal protec tive equipment and ventilators; assistance to local governments and businesses negatively affected by the public health emergency; and assistance to providers and hospitals During FY 2021-2 2, state agencies expended $559.2 million under the CSLFRF. As of February 2023, accounting records show a remaining balance of $1.7 billion in CSLFRF funding. During FY 2021-22, DPI expended $505.2 million in funding related to the public health emergency under the Child Nutrition Cluster. During FY 2021-2 2, state agencies expended $469.1 million under the CRF. 16 INTRODUCTION to compensate for additional expendit ures to address the public health emergency. In report 22-11 we completed a limite d-scope review of the Public Service Commission's use of CRF funding for broadband expansion grants, and in report 22-21 we completed a limited- scope review of DOR's use of CRF funding for the We're All In and Wisconsin Tomorrow Programs. As reported in the SEFA, state agencies expended $469.1 million in funds from the CRF during FY 2021-22. According to amounts reported by DOA in STAR, which is the State's accoun ting system, the full amount of CRF funds was expended by September 30, 2022. Disaster Grants\u2014Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) In February 2021, a presidential memorandum was issued extending certain federal support to increase the reimbursement and other assistance provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to states in order to combat COVID-19. The memorandum allowed FEMA to pay 100 percent of the costs of activities that had previously been determined to be eligible from the beginning of the public health emergency in January 2020 through the Disaster Grants\u2014Public Assistance (Preside ntially Declared Disasters) grant, which is administered by the Department of Military Affairs. In FY 2021-22, the State reported expending a total of $347.0 million in funding related to the public health emergency under this grant. DOA and DHS received most of the funding under this program for expenditures related to the public health emergency, including for certain prior-year expenditures for which the funding source was changed in order to receive funding under this program. DOA reported in the SEFA that it expended $174.5 million under this program during FY 2021-22 related to the public heal th emergency. DHS reported in the SEFA that it expended $154.4 mi llion under this program during FY 2021-22 related to the public health emergency Unemployment Insurance The federal CARES Act created several unemployment benefit programs to provide UI benefits to individuals whose employment was affected by the public health em ergency. These programs, which began in March 2020, continued into FY 2021-22 and were extended by the federal Continued Assistance Act and ARPA. The CARES Act also established programs to provide re lief to employers through federal reimbursement of certain regular unemployment benefits. During FY 2021-22, DWD reported in the SEFA that $339.7 million of federal assistance was used to fund UI benefits for individuals whose employment was affected by the public health emergency. These federal unemployment benefits ex pired on September 4, 2021. During FY 2021-22, the State expended $347.0 million under the Disaster Grants\u2014Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) grant related to the public health emergency. During FY 2021-22, DWD expended $339.7 million in federal funds to fund UI benefits for individuals whose employment was affected by the public health emergency. INTRODUCTION 17 Pandemic EBT Food Benefits Program Under the federal Families First Coronavirus Response Act, the Pandemic EBT Food Benefits program was created to provide nutrition assistance on EBT cards as temporar y assistance for households with children affected by a school closure during the public health emergency. The federal government approved the State's plan to distribute these benefits for the 2021-2022 school year and approved the State's plan for the 2022-2023 school year. The federal government also approved the State's plan to di stribute these benefits for both the summer of 2022 and 2023. DHS largely determined eligibility based on DPI student data for children eligib le for the National School Lunch Program. DHS reported in the SEFA that it provided $312.5 million in benefits for this program during FY 2021-22. Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Infectious Diseases (ELC) Program The Epidemiology and Laboratory Ca pacity for Infectious Diseases (ELC) program assists states in protec ting public health and safety by enhancing the capacity of public heal th agencies to effectively detect, respond, prevent and control known and emerging infectious diseases. DHS received a significant increase in funding for this program during the public health emergency. DHS, with the Wisconsin State Lab of Hygiene, expended ELC funds to increase the testing capacity for COVID-19, including payments to loca l public health agencies, testing sites, and laboratories. During FY 2021-22, DHS reported in the SEFA that it expended $297.1 million in fu nding related to the public health emergency under the ELC program. Emergency Rental Assistance Program The Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program was established under the federal Consolidated Appr opriations Act of 2021 and further funded by ARPA to assist households that are unable to pay rent or utilities. The State was advanced $322.2 million in ERA Program funding in January 2021 and $112.5 million in June 2021. DOA is responsible for administering the prog ram and reported in its eligibility and benefit determination system that a total of 31,224 individuals received rental and utility assistan ce benefit payments in FY 2021-22. In report 22-3, we completed a limited-scope review of the ERA Program. During FY 2021-22, DOA reported in the SEFA that it expended $162.3 million under the ERA Program. In February 2023, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) provided DOA a $31.4 million excess funds determination for the ERA funding received under ARPA for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The amount was equal to the balanc e undrawn from Treasury as of the notification date. Treasury indicate d the $31.4 million will be deducted During FY 2021-2 2, DHS provided $312.5 million in benefits under the Pandemic EBT Food Benefits program. During FY 2021-2 2, DHS expended $297.1 million in funding related to the public health emergency under the ELC program. During FY 20 21-22, DOA expended $162.3 million under the ERA Program. 18 INTRODUCTION from the remaining undisbursed ARPA ERA allocation for the State. DOA is appealing this decision, as described in Note 3E to the SEFA. Child Care and Development Fund Cluster The CCDF Cluster is the primary federal funding source to help certain low-income families access child care and to improve the quality of child care for all children. DCF was awarded additional federal funding for this program during the publ ic health emergency, including $51.6 million under the CARES Act, $148.8 million under CRRSAA, and $357.0 million under ARPA. As appr oved by the Joint Committee on Finance, this additional federal funding was primarily used for the Child Care Counts program, which pr ovides assistance to child care providers affected by the public health emergency. During FY 2021-22, DCF reported in the SEFA that it expended $161.7 million in funding related to the public health emergency under the CCDF. Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program LIHEAP was established to provide energy assistance to eligible lowincome home owners and renters to reduce the energy burden in heating and cooling individual's ho mes. DOA was awarded additional federal funding for this program during the public health emergency, including $8.1 million under the CARES Act and $150.6 million under ARPA. During FY 2021-22, DOA reported in the SEFA that it expended $109.1 million in funding related to the public health emergency under LIHEAP. Other Federal Funding for the Public Health Emergency The remaining $272.1 million in Tabl e 4 related to other programs or clusters that received additional fe deral funding for the public health emergency as separately identified in the SEFA. The largest of these other expenditures included: $48.8 million reported by DOT under the Highway Planning and Construction Cluster; $37.9 million reported by DHS under the Immunization Cooperative Agreements program; $23.0 million reported by DOT under the Formula Grants for Rural Areas and Tribal Transit Program; $16.2 million reported by DOA under the Emergency Solutions Grant Program. During FY 2021-22, DCF expended $161.7 million in funding related to the public health emergency under the CCDF Cluster. During FY 2021-22, DOA expended $109.1 million in funding related to the public health emergency under LIHEAP. INTRODUCTION 19 Public Health Emergency Expiration The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has announced that it is planning for the public health emergency to expire on May 11, 2023. In addition, the Consol idated Appropriations Act of 2023, which was enacted in December 2022, began to change program benefits and flexibilities that were provided during the public health emergency. For example, emergency benefits provided under SNAP ended in February 2023, and the increased FMAP of 6.2 percent that had been in effect during the public health emergency will be phased out through December 2023. In addition, continuous enrollment requirements for the MA Program will end effective April 1, 2023, and DHS will begin the process of comp leting renewals and terminating enrollment for ineligible individu als. The \"unwinding\" period for continuous enrollment for the MA Program is expected to be completed by May 2024. We also note that some programs, such as the ERA Program, began to sunset in FY 2022-23. Maximizing Federal Revenue\u2014 Medical Assistance Program The U.S. Department of Health an d Human Services provides funding to DHS for the MA Program. Particip ants in the MA Program may also be eligible for Medicare, and the State helps to pay for the Medicare premiums due from these particip ants. On a monthly basis, DHS receives invoices from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) that represent the State's share of participant premiums. Premium payments are due on the first of the month following receipt of the invoice and if amounts are not paid within the allowed grace period, CMS can issue a grant award noti ce to the State that reduces the State's MA Program award for the required payment amount. In January 2021, DHS received invoic es for Medicare premiums due to the federal government on February 1, 2021. The payment DHS made was not received by CMS within the allowed grace period. As a result, CMS issued an MA Program award re duction notice in March 2021 for $43.0 million to cover the missed paym ents. Because DHS did, in fact, pay the February 1, 2021 invoices , DHS both paid the Medicare premiums and received an award reduction. DHS was unaware that this had occurred until we informed them in March 2023. We determined that DHS did not adequately review the award notice detailing the reduction and perform a dditional steps to assess if the award reduction was appropriate. Enhanced federal benefits provided during the public health emergency have begun to sunset in 2023. If DHS fails to pay Medicare premiums, the federal government can reduce the State's MA Program award. DHS both paid Medicare premiums and received a $43.0 million MA Program award reduction in 2021, but did not identify this until we informed it in March 2023. 20 INTRODUCTION Recommendation We reco mmend the Wisconsin Department of Health Services: work with the federal government to determine if the amount of the reduction for the federal fisc al year 2020-21 award for the Medical Assistance Program can yet be provided to the State; and implement pr ocedures to review future Medical Assi stance Program award notices and perform necessary follow-up to confirm the award am ounts are appropriate. DHS agreed with our recommendations and indicated the overpayment was the result of an infrequent occurrence where CMS reduced an award allocation in the amount of a missed payment. DHS indicated it will work with th e federal government to obtain a credit on future Medicare premium invoices to effectively collect the overpayment. DHS also indicated it will add a reconciliation process improvement that will account for this exception, and it will work with the fiscal agent to ensure time ly payment of the premiums. Statewide Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards DOA is responsible for c oordinating with the other state agencies to prepare the State of Wisconsin's SEFA. Each state agency prepares a SEFA for the federal programs that it administers, and DOA compiles the agency-level SEFAs into the statewide SEFA. DOA performs desk reviews of the agency-level SEFAs to ensure the expenditures reconcile to STAR. During FY 2021-22, certain state agencies transferred FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21 expenditures from the CRF and the ELC grant to the Disaster Grants\u2014Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) grant. In addition, during FY 2021-22 DOA transferred FY 2020-21 expenditures from the CSLFRF grant to the CRF grant. In the STAR General Ledger, the prior-year transf erred expenditures resulted in a reduction in the CSLFRF, CRF, and ELC grant expenditures. In compiling the FY 2021-22 statewide SEFA, DOA did not make a subsequent adjustment to remove the expenditure adjustments from the CSLFRF, the CRF, and the ELC grants. As a result, FY 2021-22 expenditures were underreported by $192.1 million for the CSLFRF, by $241.3 million the CRF, and by $55.9 million for the ELC grant. Further, because the transfer of prior-year expenditures in the current year changed the prior-year total federal expenditures, there was a potential effect on the prior-year single audit re sults that could result in the need DHS agreed with our recommendations and plans to work with the federal government to recover the $43.0 million in lost MA Program funding. DOA coordinate s with the other state agencies to prepare the State of Wisconsin's Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards. Certain state agencies transferred prior-year expenditures between federal grant programs in FY 2021-22. As a result of the tran sfer of prior-year expenditures, grant expenditures were underreported for certain grants. INTRODUCTION 21 to re-issue the prior-year single au dit report. However, we assessed the revised total federal expenditures in FY 2019-20 and in FY 2020-21, and we determined that the audit results for FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21 did not require an update. After we had discussions regarding our concerns with the amounts reported in the draft SEFA, DOA corrected the under-reporting of expenditures for the CSLFRF, the CRF, and the ELC grants. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Administration: update its guidance and instructions to state agencies to reflect the need to evaluate adjustments of all prior-year expenditures and other material negative adjustments to currentyear expenditures to ensure the currentyear expenditures are reflected accurately; and consider if there are adjustments needed to its current desk-review procedures when evaluating the agency-level schedules of expenditures of federal awards. DOA agreed with our recommendat ions and indicated plans to update its existing procedures wh en evaluating agency-level SEFA submissions. DOA also noted that it does not believe there is authoritative guidance regarding the treatment of transfers of prior-year expenditures in the SEFA and indicated plans to continue to seek federal confirmation on how to report this activity. Existing Uniform Guidance requires the State to report federal grant expenditures incurred in the fiscal year. The Bureau obtained confirmation from federal officials that reflecting the transfer of prioryear expenditures as a reduction of the current-year grant expenditures understates grant expenditures, and should be reflected in the notes to the SEFA, rather than as a reduction of current year grant expenditures. Further, training presented by federal officials in March 2022 also promoted this presen tation of prior-year expenditure transfers. Future Federal Funding During FY 2022-23, and subsequent to our audit period, state agencies continued to spend federal funding provided to address the public health emergency. In addition, in November 2021 the federal government enacted the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which includes funding for transpor tation, drinking water programs, broadband programs, and cybersecurity initiatives. Portions of this funding will be received by the State through existing federal programs, DOA indicated plans to update its existing procedures and plans to continue to seek federal confirmation on the reporting of prior-year expenditure transfers in the current SEFA. 22 INTRODUCTION such as the Highway Planning and Construction grant and LIHEAP. We anticipate future single audits wi ll also include audit work related to funding provided for new federal programs established under this federal law. 23 Auditor's Report 25 Legislative Audit Bureau STATE OF WISCONSIN Joe Chrisman State Auditor www.legis.wisconsin.gov/lab AskLAB@legis.wisconsin.gov 22 East Mifflin Street, Suite 500 Madison, Wisconsin 53703 Main: (608) 266-2818 Hotline: 1-877-FRAUD-17 Independent Auditor's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and on Compliance and Other Matters Honorable Members of the Legislature The Honorable Tony Evers, Governor We have audited the financial statements and the re lated notes of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, th e aggregate discretely presented compon ent units, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the State of Wisconsin, which collectively comprise the State's basic financial statements, as of an d for the year ended June 30, 2022, and have issued our report thereon dated December 20, 2022. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing st andards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, which is issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. The basic financial statements and related auditor's opinions have been included in the State of Wisconsin's Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Our report includes a refere nce to other auditors who audited the financial statements of the Environmental Improvement Fund, the Deferred Compensation Fund, the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority, the University of Wiscon sin (UW) Hospitals and Clinics Authority, and the UW Foundation, as described in our report on the State of Wisconsin's basic financial statements. The financial statements of the Environmental Improvement Fund, the UW Hospital s and Clinics Authority, and the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority were audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and Government Auditing Standards . This report does not include the results of the other auditors' testing of internal co ntrol over financial reporting or compliance and other matters that were reported on sepa rately by those auditors. Although the financial statements of the Deferred Compensation Fund and the UW Foundation we re audited in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of Amer ica, they were not audited in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and, accordingly, this report does not include reporting on internal control over financial reporting or instances of reportable noncompliance associated with the Deferred Compensation Fund or the UW Foundation. Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the State of Wisconsin is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (int ernal control). In planning and perf orming our audit of the financial statements, we considered the State's internal contro l as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of ex pressing our opinions on the financial statements, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the State's internal control. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on the effectiveness of the State's internal control. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or oper ation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent misstatements, or to detect and correct misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a 26 AUDITOR'S REPORT deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the State's basic financial statements will not be prevented, or that a material misstatement will not be detected and corrected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attentio n by those charged with governance. Our consideration of internal control was for the li mited purpose described in the first paragraph of this section and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in inte rnal control that might be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies and, therefore, material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may exist that were not identified. Given these limitations, during our audit we did not identify any deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be material weaknesses. We did identify certain deficiencies in internal control that we consider to be significant defi ciencies. Specifically, we consider the deficiencies in internal control, described in Section II of the Sc hedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as Findings 2022-001 through 2022-007, to be significant deficiencies. Report on Compliance and Other Matters As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about wh ether the State's basic financial statements are free from material misstatement, we performed tests of compli ance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements, noncompliance with wh ich could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. However, providing an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit and, accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. The results of our tests disclosed no instances of noncom pliance or other matters that are required to be reported under Government Auditing Standards . Responses to Findings Government Auditing Standards require the auditor to perform limite d procedures on the agency-specific written response to the findings identified in the audit and described in Section II of the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs. The corrective action plans for the findings identified in our audit are included in the Corrective Action Plans chapter. The responses and corrective action plans were not subjected to other auditing procedures applied in the audit of the financial statements and, accordingly, we express no opinion on them. Purpose of This Report This report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be used when considering the State's internal control and compliance. The purpose of this report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control and compliance and the result of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the State' s internal control or on compliance. Accordingly, this report is not suitable for any other purpose. L EGISL ATIVE AUDI T BUREAU December 20, 2022 27 Auditor's Reports on Federal Programs 29 Legislative Audit Bureau STATE OF WISCONSIN Joe Chrisman State Auditor www.legis.wisconsin.gov/lab AskLAB@legis.wisconsin.gov 22 East Mifflin Street, Suite 500 Madison, Wisconsin 53703 Main: (608) 266-2818 Hotline: 1-877-FRAUD-17 Independent ance for Each Major Federal Program; Report on Internal Control over Compliance; and Report on the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Required by Uniform Guidance Honorable Members of the Legislature The Honorable Tony Evers, Governor Report on Compliance for Ea ch Major Federal Program Qualified and Unmodified Opinions We have audited the State of Wisconsin's compliance with the ty pes of compliance requirements identified as subject to audit in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Compliance Supplement that could have a direct and material effect on each of the State of Wisconsin's major federal programs for the year ended June 30, 2022. The State of Wisconsi n's major federal programs are identified in the Summary of Auditor's Results section of the accompan ying Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs. The State of Wisconsin's basic financial statements include the operations of the following discretely presented component units, which expended federal awards that are not included in the State of Wisconsin's Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Aw ards for the year ended June 30, 2022: Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority, Wisc onsin Economic Development Corporation, and the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics Author ity. Our audit, as described under the Auditor's Responsibility section of the repo rt, did not include the operations of these discretely presented component units, because they engaged other auditors to perform an audit of compliance in accordance with audit requirements of Uniform Guidance. Qualified Opinion on Emergency Rental Assistance Program In our opinion, except for the noncompliance desc ribed in the Basis for Qualified and Unmodified Opinions section of our report, the State of Wisconsin complied, in all material respects, with the types of compliance requirements referred to in the first paragr aph that could have a direct and material effect on COVID-19\u2014Emergency Rental Assistance Program (Assistance Listing number 21.023) for the year ended June 30, 2022. Unmodified Opinion on Each of the Other Major Federal Programs In our opinion, the State of Wisconsin complied, in all material respects, with the compliance requirements referred to in the first paragraph that co uld have a direct and material effect on each of its other major federal programs that are identified in the Summary of Auditor's Results section of the accompanying Schedule of Findings and Questi oned Costs for the year ended June 30, 2022. Basis for Qualified and Unmodified Opinions We conducted our audit of compliance in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAS); the standards applicable to financia l audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; and the audit requirements of Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200 , Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). Our re sponsibilities under those 30 AUDITOR'S REPORTS ON FEDERAL PROGRAMS standards and Uniform Guidanc e are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section of our report. We are required to be independent of the State of Wisc onsin and to meet other ethical responsibilities in accordance with relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provid e a basis for our qualified and unmodified opinions on compliance for each major federal program. Our audit does not provide a legal determination of the State of Wisconsin's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to in the preceding section. Matter Giving Rise to Qualified Opinion on Emergency Rental Assistance Program As described in the accompanying Sc hedule of Findings and Questioned Costs, the State of Wisconsin did not comply with requirements for the COVI D-19\u2014Emergency Rental Assistance Program: Assistance Listing Number Major Federal Program Compliance Requirement Finding Number 21.023 COVID-19\u2014Emergency Rental Assistance Program Activities Allowed or Unallowed, Allowable Costs/Cost Principles, and Eligibility 2022-102 Complian ce with such requirements is necessary, in our opinion, for the State of Wisconsin to comply with the requirements applicable to that program. Responsibilities of Management for Compliance Management of each Wisconsin state agency is respon sible for compliance with the requirements referred to in the first paragraph and for th e design, implementation, and maintena nce of effective internal control over compliance with the requirements of laws, statutes, regulations, rule s, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements applicable to the St ate of Wisconsin's federal programs. Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assuranc e about whether material noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to in the first pa ragraph occurred, whether due to fraud or error, and express an opinion on the State of Wisconsin's compliance based on our audit. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assura nce and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Governmental Auditing Standards , and Uniform Guidance will always detect material noncompliance when it exists . The risk of not detectin g material noncompliance resulting from fraud is higher than for that resulting from error, as fraud may in volve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Noncompliance with the compliance requirements referred to above is considered material, if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, it would influence th e judgment made by a reasonable user of the report on compliance about the State of Wisconsin's compli ance with the requirements of each major federal program as a whole. In performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Government Auditing Standards , and Uniform Guidance, we exercised professional judgment and ma intained professional sk epticism throughout the audit. We also identified and assessed the risks of ma terial noncompliance, whethe r due to fraud or error, and designed and performed audit procedures respon sive to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the State of Wisconsin's compliance with the compliance requirements referred to in the first paragraph and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. AUDITOR'S REPORTS ON FEDERAL PROGRAMS 31 In addition, we obtained an understanding of the St ate of Wisconsin's internal control over compliance relevant to the audit in order to design audit proced ures that are appropriate in the circumstances and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with Uniform Guidance, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectivene ss of the State of Wisconsi n's internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. We are required to communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and any si gnificant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control over compliance that we identified during the audit. Other Matters The results of our auditing procedures disclosed in stances of noncompliance which are required to be reported in accordance with Uniform Guidance an d which are described in the accompanying agency report narratives and in Section III of the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as Findings 2022 001, 2022-704. Our opinion on each major federa l program is not modified with respect to these matters. Government Auditing Standards requires the auditor to perform li mited procedures on Wisconsin state agencies' responses and corrective action plans to the noncompliance findings iden tified in our audit in the accompanying agency report narratives and in th e Corrective Action Plans chapter, respectively. The responses and corrective action plans were not subjecte d to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on them. Report on Internal Control over Compliance Our consideration of internal control over compliance was for the limited purpose described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of Compliance section ab ove and was not designed to identify all deficiencies in internal control over compliance that might be materi al weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance, and therefor e, material weaknesses or significan t deficiencies may exist that were not identified. However, as discussed below, we did identify certain defi ciencies in internal control over compliance that we consider to be materi al weaknesses and significant deficiencies. A deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncom pliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a time ly basis. We consider the deficiency in internal control over compliance described in the accompanying agency report narratives and in Section III of the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as Finding 2022-102 to be a material weakness. A significant deficiency in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance with a type of co mpliance requirement of a federal program that is less severe than a material weakness in internal contro l over compliance, yet im portant enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. We consider the deficiencies in internal control over compliance described in the accompanying agency repo rt narratives and in Section III of the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs as Findings 2022-001, to be significant deficiencies. 32 AUDITOR'S REPORTS ON FEDERAL PROGRAMS Our audit was not designed for the pu rpose of expre ssing an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. Government Auditing Standards requires the auditor to perform li mited procedures on the Wisconsin state agencies' responses and corrective action plans to the internal control over compliance findings identified in our compliance audit described in th e accompanying agency report narratives and in the Corrective Action Plans chapter, respectively. Th e responses and corrective action plans were not subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of compliance and, accordingly, we express no opinion on them. The purpose of this report on internal control over compliance is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over compliance and the results of that testing based on the requirements of Uniform Guidance. Accordingly, this repo rt is not suitable for any other purpose. Report on the Schedule of Ex penditures of Federal Awards Required by Uniform Guidance We have audited the financial statements of the gove rnmental activities, the bu siness-type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, ea ch major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information for the State of Wisconsi n as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes to the financial statements, which collectively comprise the State of Wisconsin's basic financial statements. We have issued our report thereon dated December 20, 2022, which contains unmodified opinions on those financial statements. Our audi t was conducted for the purpose of forming opinions on the financial statements that collectively comprise the basic financial statements. We have not performed any procedures with respect to the audited financial statements subsequent to December 20, 2022. The accompanying Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards is presen ted for purposes of additional analysis, as required by Uniform Guidance, and is no t a required part of the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of management and was derived from and relates directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to pr epare the basic financial statements. The information has been subjected to the auditing pr ocedures applied in the audit of th e financial statements and certain additional procedures, including comparing and reconciling such information directly to the underlying accounting and other records used to prepare the basic financial statements, and other additional procedures in accordance with auditing standards gener ally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the schedule of expenditures of federa l awards is fairly stated in all material respects in relation to the basic financial statements as a whole. LEGISLATIVE AUDIT BUREAU March 29, 2023 33 The Wisconsin Department of Administra tion (DOA) provides support services to other state agencies, manages cert ain housing and economic development activities, and performs other functions pres cribed by law. DOA is also responsible for providing the Governor with fiscal management information and the policy alternatives required for preparing Wiscon sin's biennial budget. In FY 2021-22, DOA administered approximately $1.0 billi on in federal financial assistance. We tested DOA's internal controls and comp liance with grant requirements for three type A programs: the Emergency Rental Assi stance (ERA) Program (Assistance Listing number 21.023), Coronavirus State and Lo cal Fiscal Recovery Funds (CSLFRF) (Assistance Listing number 21.027), an d Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) (Assistance Listing nu mber 93.568). We also tested the Home Investment Partnerships Program (Assista nce Listing number 14.239), which is a type B program. We identified the following internal control and compliance concerns: Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds\u2014Unallowa ble Costs (Finding 20 22-100) ; Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program\u2014Heating Benefit Calc ulation (Finding 2022 -101); Emergency Rental Assistance Program\u2014Documentation to Support App licant Eligibility and Bene fit Payments (Find ing 2022102); Multiple Grants\u2014Reporting in th e Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (Finding 2022-1 03); an d Low -Income Home Energy Assistance Program\u2014Fe deral Funding Acc ountability and Transparency Act Reporting (Finding 2022 104).Department of Administration 34 DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION In report 22-26 we evaluated DOA's intern al controls over financial reporting for FY 2021-22. In Section II of the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs, which begins on page 83, we include three internal control concerns related to the State's information technology security cont rols managed by DOA (Findings 2022-002, 2022 003, and 2022-004). In addition, we followed up on the progre ss of DOA in addressing Findings 2021-100 through 2021-105 of our FY 2020-21 audit (report 22-5). DOA implemented corrective actions to address Findings 2021-101 thro ugh 2021-105, and to partially address Finding 2021-100. We also followed up on the progress of DOA in addressing financial reporting concerns related to information technology security controls (Findings 2021-001 from report 22-5 and Fi nding 2020-001 from report 21-6). DOA implemented corrective actions to partially address Finding 2021-001 and Finding 2020-001. It will be important for DOA to continue to work to resolve these findings. The Summary Schedule of Prior Audit Findings, which is prepared by management, begins on page 111 and describes th e status of these findings as of the end of our audit period as well as ongoing steps to address findings that were not fully corrected. Finding 2022-100: Coronavirus Stat e and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds\u2014Unallowable Costs Background: The State wa s advanced $1.3 billion in CSLFRF funding in May 2021 and another $1.3 billion in May 2022. CSLFRF was created under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and is administered by DOA. CSLFRF funding has certain stipulations, including that the funds must be used to: respond to the public health emer ge ncy or its negative economic impa cts; respond to the needs of workers performing essential work du ring the public health emerge ncy; provide government servi ces to the extent revenue losses due to the public healt h emergency reduced reve nues; and make necessary investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastruc ture. Further, federal regulations stipulate that eligible expenditures must be incurred between March 3, 2021, and December 31, 2024, and funds must be spent through December 31, 2026. DOA paid funds to other state agencies fo r programs they administered and spent funds on its own programs. Two of the prog rams established by DOA were the Live Event Small Business Grant Program and the Minor League Sports Team Grant Program. The Live Event Small Business Grant Program provided grants to eligible live event small businesses within the State of Wisconsin that generated 50.0 percent or more of their revenue through provision of goods and/or services to live venues. The Minor League Sports Team Grant Program prov ided grants to eligible Wisconsin-based minor league sports teams that had attendance of at least 30,000 and not more than DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION 35 300,000 at events held in 2019. Applicants su bmitted application materials, including federal income tax information or total revenue, and awards were made after review and approval by DOA. Grant awar d amounts were determined based on the decrease in the applicant's federal ta xable income or total revenue between calendar years 2019 and 2020, up to a maximum amount of $200,000. Criteria: In accordance with 2 CFR s. 200.303, DO A is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over federal awards that provides reasonable assurance that it is managing federal awar ds in compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditio ns of federal awards. Further, under U.S. Department of the Treasury Final Ru le (31 CFR Part 35), DOA must establish rigorous oversight and internal control pr ocesses to monitor compliance with any applicable requirements of CSLFRF funding. Condition: We identified that DOA made a payment of $161,363 to an organization under both the Live Event Small Business Program and the Minor League Sports Team Grant Program. The applicant reported its 2019 and 2020 fede ral taxable income in both applications and its decrease in income from 2019 to 2020 was $161,363. DOA paid the organization $161,363 under the Minor League Sports Team Grant Program on January 5, 2022, and then paid the organization $161,363 under the Live Event Small Business Program on January 12, 2022. Context: During FY 2021-22, DOA expended $185.2 million in CSLFRF funding, including providing $11.2 million to 96 organizations under the Live Event Small Business Grant Program and $2.8 million to 17 organization s under the Minor League Sports Team Grant Program. We interviewed DOA staff, reviewed applications, and examined payment documentation for these programs. Questioned Costs: $161,363 Effect: Without adequate internal controls in plac e, DOA is at increased risk of making inappropriate payments using CSLFRF funding. Cause: When administering the CSLFRF grant, DOA di d not establish effective internal controls to assess the appropriateness of making a payment to an applicant that applies under multiple programs. DOA staff indicated that such controls were implemented for certain programs where DOA anticipated an appl icant might apply under more than one program. However, DOA indicated that it ha d not anticipated that an applicant would apply under both the Live Event Small Busi ness Grant Program and the Minor League Sports Team Grant Program. 36 DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION Recommendation We recomm end the Wisconsin Department of Administration: develop and implement controls to identify when an applicant applies for funding under multip le programs and to assess the appropriateness of whether it would be making payments to an applicant that applies under multiple programs; and review the specific payments made to the organization we identified and seek repayment of the amount that was made inappropriately. Finding 2022-100: Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds\u2014 Unallowable Costs COVID-19\u2014Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (Assistance Listing number 21.027) Award Numb er Award Year None 2021 Questioned Costs: $161 ,363 Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency, Noncompliance Response from the Wisconsin De partment of Administration: The Wisconsin Department of Administration agrees wi th the audit finding and recommendations. Finding 2022-101: Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program\u2014 Heating Benefit Calculation Background: The U.S. Department of Health and Huma n Services (DHHS) provides funding to DOA's Division of Energy, Housing, and Community Resources (DEHCR) for LIHEAP. This program is used to provide energy assi stance to eligible low-income home owners and renters to reduce the energy burden in heating their homes. DOA uses the Home Energy (HE) Plus computer system to determ ine eligibility for individuals applying for benefits, calculate heating benefits, an d store information on applicants and beneficiaries. Program benefits are calculated based on applicant information that is entered into Home Energy (HE) Plus by DO A's local agency partners. DOA submits an annual state plan to DHHS for LIHEAP. This state plan includes the estimated program benefit levels, as well as other information. In the federal fiscal year 2022 state plan, DOA estimated a minimum program benefit award amount of $30 and a maximum program benefit award amount of $1,518. Criteria: Under 42 U.S. Code ch. 94, states are required to provide in a timely manner the highest level of assistance to those households with the lowest incomes and the highest energy costs or needs rela tive to income and family size. DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION 37 Under 2 CFR 200.303, DOA is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over federal awards to provide reasonable assurance that federal awards are managed in compliance with fe deral statutes, regulations, and the award terms and conditions. Condition: After we asked questions about the calcul ation of the maximum heating benefit award amount, DOA informed us that it did not accurately calculate the maximum heating benefit award amount for inclusion in its st ate plan. Specifically, DOA did not include the adjusted benefit factor, which is used to estimate total caseload and total budget for the year to ensure that as many eligible a pplicants may be served as possible. As noted, DOA calculated a maximum heating benefit award amount of $1,518. When the adjusted benefit factor was included in the calculation, the maximum heating benefit award amount increased to $2,407. Context: In FY 2021-22, DOA expended $205.6 million under the LIHEAP grant, including providing $80.6 million in heating benefits to over 190,000 households. We inquired of DOA staff regarding the LIHEAP benefit calculation and how it is determined. We tested the heating benefit calculation and analyzed DOA's determination of the number of households affected by the e rror DOA made in calculating the maximum heating benefit amount. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: As a result of the error in calculatin g the maximum heating benefit award amount, DOA determined that it underpaid LIHEAP benefits for 605 households in FY 2021-22. DOA calculated that the 605 households were underpaid a total of $130,352 in heating benefits. At the time of our fieldwork in February 2023, DOA was in the process of recalculating heating benefits and issuin g supplemental heating benefit payments. Cause: DOA staff indicated that the underlying parameters for determining the LIHEAP heating benefit maximum are calculated usin g an external Microsoft Access database. DOA Division of Enterprise Technology sta ff manually load these parameters into the benefit factor table into Home Energy (HE) Plus. DEHCR staff indicated they perform a review of the parameters after they are load ed into Home Energy (HE) Plus. However, this review was not effective in identifyin g the error in the maximum heating benefit award amount, and DOA did not document the performance of the review. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Administration: establish and implement written pr ocedures for making updates to the benefit calculation parameters in the Home Energy (HE) Plus application; 38 DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION reassess its existing procedures for performing a review of the benefit calculation parameters ente red into the Home Energy (HE) Plus application, make adjustment s to its existing procedures as necessary, and document the performance of each review; and complete its review of the 605 households that were underpaid heating benefits due to the erro r and issue supplemental heating benefit payments.

Finding 2022-102: Emergency Rental Assi stance Program\u2014Documentation to Support Applicant Eligibil ity and Benefit Payments Background: The ERA Program was established in FY 2020-21 under the federal Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and was contin ued in FY 2021-22 under ARPA. The ERA Program is administered by the U.S. Depart ment of the Treasury (Treasury) and was established to assist households that are unable to pay rent or utilities. In January 2021, DOA was advanced $322.2 million in ERA 1 funding. In May and June 2021, DOA was advanced $112.5 million in ERA 2 funding. Federal requirements under ERA 1 and ERA 2 are similar with some variation in the income eligibility requirements. DOA established the Wisconsin Emergency Rental Assistance (WERA) program using the federal ERA Program funding. According to DOA's WERA Program Manual , ERA 1 was fully expended as of February 24, 2022, and ERA 2 policies were established as of September 2, 2021. To administer the WERA program, DOA cont racted with community action agencies, including the Wisconsin Community Action Pr ogram (WISCAP) Association, and Energy Services, Inc. (ESI), to intake and review individual applications for eligibility. The community action agencies and ESI were resp onsible for entering th e applications into DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION 39 DOA's Home Energy (HE) Plus computer system, which was used to determine and process the benefit payment amount. To rece ive assistance through the WERA program, an individual must first apply for the Wi sconsin Home Energy Assistance Program (WHEAP) and have an active applic ation in Home Energy (HE) Plus. We identified concerns with DOA's administra tion of the WERA program as part of our performance evaluation of the Emergency Re ntal Assistance and Emergency Solutions Grant programs (report 22-3) and our FY 2020- 21 single audit (report 22-5). We made recommendations for DOA to make improv ements (Finding 2021-104 in report 22-5). In response to our recommendations, DOA u pdated its policies and procedures in the WERA Program Manual , effective June 30, 2022, and provided training to the community action agencies and ESI. Criteria: Under Treasury guidance, to be eligible for DOA's WERA program a household must be obligated to pay rent on a residential dwelling and: at least one individual within the household must qualify for unemployment benefits or has expe rienced a reduction in household income, incurred significant costs, or experienced other financial hardship because of the public health emergency; and at least one individual within the household must be at risk of experiencing homelessness or housing instability; and the total household income must be 80 percent or less of the median income in the county where the hous ehold is located (ERA 1 funding), or the household must be a low-in come family as defined in 42 U.S.C. 1437a(b) (ERA 2 funding). Treasury guidance allows the State to rely on self-attestation for verification of an applicant's income. If a household meets the eligibility requirements based on a written attestation without further documentation, Treasury guidance indicates that the State must redetermine household income every three months by requesting that applicants submit documentation or a written attestation. Treasury guidance indicates that applicants must provide a current lease that is signed by the applicant and the landlord identifying the rental unit and the rental payment amount. If a lease is unavailable, other documentation of residence should be obtained, such as a utility bill. Further, Treasury guidance indicates that if the applicant cannot present documentation of th e amount of rent, a written attestation may be accepted for up to three months. If a dditional assistance is needed after that time, documentation of the rent amount is required. Treasury guidance requires that all payme nts for utilities and home energy costs be supported by a bill, invoice, or evidence of payment to the utility provider or home energy service. To make benefit payments under the WERA program, DOA requires: an income attestation form, which indicates that the applicant has been unable to pay rent and/or utilitie s and is at risk of losing housing or facing eviction due to COVID-related events, states that the 40 DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION applicant is not receiving other federally funded emergency rental assistance, and describes why income was impacted; a renter verification form, which indicates applicant name and applicant rental information, such as landlord, rent amount, and description of assistance requested; and supporting documentation, such as invoices, utility bills, a lease agreement, or other documentation. Further, when recertifying an applicant for eligibility after three months, DOA's WERA Program Manual indicates that the client's current income must be reviewed, notes are required to be entered into Home Ener gy (HE) Plus indicating how the income eligibility was calculated, and an updated re nter verification form is to be uploaded into Home Energy (HE) Plus. Condition: We tested a sample of 60 individuals who applied for and received benefits under the WERA program. In our testing, we found that DOA did not have sufficient documentation in Home Energy (HE) Plus to demonstrate that all of the applicants were eligible to receive benefits under the program or that the costs were allowable to be funded by the ERA Program. We found concerns with: the income attestation forms for 10 of 60 individuals, where DOA did not have documentation of a completed income attestation form or the income attestation form was at least 90 days old at the time of application; the income recertification documentation for 6 of 9 individuals in our sample where DOA did not have documentation that a timely income recertification was completed; the renter verification form for 7 of 60 individuals, where DOA did not have documentation of a completed form or the form was from a prior application for funding and was not updated; and utility assistance for 5 of 14 individuals in our sample where DOA did not have documentation to support the amounts paid. We also identified other documentation conc erns that were not material but that we verbally discussed with DOA staff. Context: In FY 2021-22, DOA processed $135.5 million in ERA Program benefit payments, using Home Energy (HE) Plus, of which $132.1 mi llion was made to either landlords or tenants and $3.4 million was made to utilit y companies. A total of 31,224 households were reported in Home Energy (HE) Plus as having received rental and utility assistance benefit payments under the ERA Program in FY 2021-22. We evaluated Treasury guidance related to the ERA Program, discussed the application procedures with DOA staff, and reviewed DOA's WERA Program Manual . We selected DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION 41 a random sample of 60 individuals who re ceived ERA Program benefits in FY 2021-22 and reviewed available documentat ion in Home Energy (HE) Plus. Questioned Costs: We question $52,562 in rental and utility assistance payments for which DOA did not have adequate supporting documentation in Home Energy (HE) Plus. We removed instances of duplication in the documentatio n concerns we identified and determined that questioned costs includes: $30,258 in benefits paid for 10 indi viduals for whom DOA did not have documentation of a comp leted or timely income attestation form; $10,878 in benefits paid for 4 indivi duals for whom DOA did not have documentation of a timely income recertification; $9,150 in benefits paid for 3 indivi duals for whom DOA either did not have documentation of a renter veri fication form or did not have a current renter verification form; and $2,276 in benefits paid for 5 indi viduals for whom DOA did not have documentation of payments ma de for utility assistance. We also question an undetermined amount for individuals that we did not test. Effect: DOA provided rental and utilit y assistance to individuals who may have been ineligible to receive ERA Program benefits, which ma y have resulted in improper payments. Cause: During FY 2021-22, DOA did not provide suffi cient oversight and training to ESI and the community action agencies that were responsible for entering the applicant information into Home Energy (HE) Plus and ensuring the appropriate supporting documentation was entered into the system. Further, DOA's WERA Program Manual did not clearly address all Treasury do cumentation requirements to determine eligibility or allowability of costs. For example, DOA's WERA Program Manual did not specify that a lease must be provided, if avai lable, or the requirement that an applicant must provide documentation of rental amount s if assistance is requested for longer than three months. In response to our prior-year recommendation, DOA provided training to the community action agencies and ESI in June 2022, and updated the WERA Program Manual as of June 30, 2022. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Administration: obtain the required documentat ion for the 22 individuals we identified or seek to recoup impr oper benefit payments it made to these individuals; closely monitor the documentat ion being accepted by the community action agencies and Energy Services, Inc., and provide further training to address individual instances of noncompliance 42 DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION with the Wisconsin Emergency Rental Assistance Program Manual and guidance from the U.S. De partment of the Treasury; and regularly review and update its pr ocedures to ensure that it is following the guidance from the U.S. Department of the Treasury in administering the Wisconsin Emerge ncy Rental Assistance program. Finding 2022-102: Emergency Rental Assistance Program\u2014Documentation to Support Applicant Eligibility and Benefit Payments COVID-19\u2014Emergency Rental Assistance Program (Assistance Listing number 21.023) Award Number Award Year None 2021 Questioned Type of Finding: Material Weakness, Ma terial Noncompliance Response from the Wisconsin De partment of Administration: The Wisconsin Department of Administration agrees wi th the audit finding and recommendation. Finding 2022-103: Multiple Grants \u2014Reporting in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Background: The DOA State Controller's Office (SCO) is re sponsible for coordinating with the other state agencies to prepare the State of Wisc onsin Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA). The SEFA, which is required to be published in the State of Wisconsin single audit report, is a listing of all fe deral programs administered by an entity, includes the total expenditures for the re porting period, and identifies any amounts provided to subrecipients for each federal program. Each state agency prepares a SEFA for the federal programs that it administers. For federal programs administered by DOA, the DOA Bureau of Financial Management (BFM) prepares the SEFA and provides this SEFA to DOA SCO. DOA SCO compiles the agency-level SEFAs into the statewide SEFA. DOA SCO performs desk reviews of the agency-level SEFAs to ensure the expenditur es reconcile to the accounting records in STAR, which is the State's accounting system. Criteria: Under 2 CFR 200.510 (b), the State is required to prepare a SEFA for the period covered by the State's financial statements and the SEFA must include the total federal awards expended. Under 2 CFR 200.502, the dete rmination of when a federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to the federal award occurs. Finally, 2 CFR 200.514 indicates that the fi nancial statements and SEFA must be for the same audit period. DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION 43 Generally accepted accounting principles r equire that the correction of prior-period amounts in the financial statements should be reported as an adjustment to the opening fund balance and not be reported as an adjustment to the current-year activity. Further, the adjustment and its e ffects should be disclosed in the footnotes. These concepts are similarly applie d to the preparation of the SEFA. Condition: During FY 2021-22, DOA BFM transferred grant to Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF ) (Assistance number and the CRF to the Disaster Grants\u2014Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) grant (Assistance List ing number 97.036). In the STAR General Ledger, the prior-year transferred expenditur es resulted in a reduction in the CSLFRF and CRF grant expenditures. In reporting these amounts in the FY 2021-22 SEFA, DOA BFM did not make a subsequent adjustment to remove the expenditure adjustments from the CSLFRF and CRF grants. Context: The State administered and reported in it s SEFA $20.2 billion in federal financial assistance in FY 2021-22. DOA administer ed $990.5 million in federal financial assistance in FY 2021-22. We reviewed DOA's SEFA to assess the reported expenditures, particularly for major programs. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: In preparing its FY underreported for million and for the CRF by $241.3 million. Further, because the transfer of prior-year expenditures in the current ye ar changed the prior-year total federal expenditures, there is a potential effect on th e prior-year single audit results that could result in the need to re-issue the prior-year single audit report. However, we assessed the revised total federal expenditures in FY 2019-20 and in FY 2020-21 and we determined that the audit results for FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21 did not require an update. Cause: DOA BFM sought to reflect the expenditures for DOA's grant programs based on the amounts recorded in the STAR General Le dger. However, DOA BFM did not consider that the negative expenditures, result ing from the transfers of FY 2019-20 and FY 202021 expenditures led to underreporting of the grant expenditures in the SEFA. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Administration: further evaluate federal grant expe nditures reported in the STAR General Ledger as it prepares its sc hedule of expenditures of federal awards and ensure it is adjustin g expenditures for all prior-year transfers of expenditures in the current year; and 44 DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION carefully assess the transfer of pr ior-year expenditures in the current year to determine any pote ntial effects on the total federal expenditures for the prior-year an d the effect on the major program expenditures.

Finding 2022-104: Low-Income Home Energ y Assistance Program\u2014Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Reporting Background: DHHS provides funding to DEHCR for LIHEAP. This program is used to provide energy assistance to eligible low- income home owners and renters to reduce the energy burden in heating and cooling their homes. LIHEAP subawards of $30,000 or more are su bject to Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) reporting. The intent of FFATA is to provide information about federal awards to allow the public access to the information to hold the government accountable for decisions. DEHCR developed a procedure to track subaward information for the LIHEAP grant, and this information was provided to the DOA Division of Executive Budget and Financ e, which was responsible for entering the information into the FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS). Criteria: Under 2 CFR s. 170, DOA is required to repo rt in FSRS subawards of $30,000 or more, including any amendments or modifications to a subaward. This reporting is to be submitted no later than the last day of the month following the month in which the creation or change to the subaward was made . For example, if the subaward was made on November 7, 2021, it must be reported in FSRS not later than December 31, 2021. DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION 45 DOA identifies subawards required to be repo rted in FSRS for LIHEAP and tracks the subawards in a spreadsheet. Condition: We found that DOA did not complete FFATA reporting for any LIHEAP subawards in FY 2021-22. In its tracking spreadsheet , DOA reported the following LIHEAP subawards: 18 subawards were entered into in June 2021; 4 subawards were entered into in September 2021; 2 subawards were entered into in October 2021; 1 subaward was entered into in November 2021; 14 subawards were entered into in May 2022; and 4 subawards were entered into in June 2022. However, DOA did not enter these subawards into FSRS until February 21, 2023 and March 2, 2023, at the time of our audit fieldwork. Context: During FY 2021-22, DOA expended $205.6 million under LIHEAP of which $17.2 million was provided to subrecipients. We interviewed DOA staff to gain an understanding of the procedures for co mpiling information for subawards and submitting the information in FSRS. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: DOA did not comply with FFATA requirements for the timely reporting of subawards in FSRS for the LIHEAP grant. Cause: DEHCR old LIHEAP federal awar d identification number (FAIN) when providing the subaward information to the DOA Division of Executive Budget and Finance, which resulted in the subaward info rmation being rejected in FSRS. Staff in the Division of Executive Budget and Finance assumed the LIHEAP subaward information was rejected because the FAIN had not been established in FSRS by the federal government. In February 2023, when DOA conducted a review of FFATA reporting, it became aware that an incorrect FAIN for LIHEAP was used. In February and March 2023, DOA entered the subawards in FSRS with the correct FAIN. 46 DEPARTMENT OF ADMINISTRATION Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Administration improve its Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act reporting procedures to ensure: accurate award information, including the federal award identification number, is being used; rejected subaward information is reviewed and communicated to the appropriate program staff for investigation and resolution; documentation of rejected subaward information is maintained to demonstrate that the Department of Administration attempted to enter the subaward information; and all required subawards of $30,000 or more, including any amendments or modifications to a subaward, are identified and submitted to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System in a timely manner.

It administers state and federal programs involving public health, mental health, substance abuse, long-term care, services to people with disabilities, and me dical care. In FY 2021-22, DHS administered $11.9 billion in federal financial assistance. We tested DHS's internal controls and co mpliance with grant requirements for three type A programs: WIC Special Suppl emental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (Assistance Listing number 10.557), Immunization Cooperative Agreements (Assistance Listing number 93 .268), and Medicaid Cluster (Assistance Listing numbers 93.775/93.777/93.778). In addition, we tested internal controls and compliance with grant requirements fo r two type A programs from which DHS received funding from other state agencies : the Disaster Grants\u2014Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) (Assi stance Listing number 97.036) from the Department of Military Affairs, and the Co ronavirus State and Lo cal Fiscal Recovery Funds (CSLFRF) (Assistance Listing nu mber 21.027) from the Department of Administration (DOA). We also tested Pandemic EBT Administrative Costs (Assistance Listing number 10.649), which is a type B program. We identified the following internal control and compliance concerns: Disaster Grants\u2014Public Assistan ce (Presidentially Declared Disasters)\u2014Unallowable Costs Medical Program\u2014Home and Community Based Services Unallowable Costs (Finding 2022-301); Multiple Grants\u2014Reporting in th e Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (Finding 2022-302); Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Reporting\u2014 Immunization Cooperative Agreements (Finding 2022-303); and Department of Health Services 48 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds\u2014Monitoring of Local and Tribal Health Department Response and Recovery Support Program Expenditures (Finding 2022-304). In report 22-26, we evaluated DHS's inte rnal controls over financial reporting for FY 2021-22. In Section II of the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs, which begins on page 83, we include two internal control deficiencies (Findings 2022-001 and 2022005) related to internal controls over fina ncial reporting for the MA Program. In addition, Finding 2022-001 is a significant defi ciency related to DHS's internal controls over compliance and an instance of nonc ompliance with federal requirements, which requires reporting for the MA Program. In addition, we followed up on the progre ss of DHS in addressing Findings 2021-300 through 2021-308 of our FY 2020-21 audit (rep 21-6) and of our FY 2017-18 audit (report 19-3). DHS 2021-305, 2021-308, and 2020-303. DHS did not actions to address Findings 2021-304, 2021-307, and 2020-309. It is important for DHS to work to resolve thes e findings. The Summary Schedule of Prior Audit Findings, which is prepared by ma nagement, begins on page 111 and describes the status of each finding as of the end of our audit period as well as ongoing steps to address findings that were not fully corrected. Finding 2022-300: Disaster Gr ants\u2014Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Di sasters)\u2014Unallowable Costs Background: In February 2021, a presidential memorand um was issued extending certain federal support to increase the reimbursement and other assistance provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to st ates in order to combat COVID-19. The memorandum allowed FEMA to pay 100 percen t of the costs of activities that had previously been determined to be eligible from the beginning of the public health emergency in January 2020. This funding was provided through the Disaster Grants\u2014 Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) grant (Assistance Listing number 97.036). As a result, DHS changed the fundin g source of certain expenditures from a prior fiscal year by moving them to this grant in FY 2021-22. Criteria: Under 2 CFR 200.403, costs charged to a federal award must be necessary and reasonable for the performance of the federal award and be adequately documented. In addition, 2 CFR 200.402 requires that th ese costs must be reduced by any applicable credits, such as refunds for overpayments. Condition: In information submitted to FEMA to su pport reimbursement for costs related to personal protective equipment, we identifi ed that DHS received reimbursements for transactions totaling $855,368 that should no t have been included in its reimbursement DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES 49 request. Specifically, we found that DHS included a $395,000 payment for which it received a refund from the vendor. In addition, we found that DHS included a payment for $460,368 twice within the supporting docu mentation it provided to FEMA for its reimbursement request. Context: During FY 2021-22, DHS received reimburs ements for costs associated with the public health emergency totaling $154.4 million from the Disaster Grants\u2014Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disast ers) grant. We reviewed the supporting documentation for the two largest reimbu rsements and tested a selection of expenditures. Questioned Costs: $855,368 Effect: Because it received Disaster Grants\u2014Pub lic Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) grant funding for inappropriate expenditure transactions, DHS was not in compliance with federal requirements. Cause: The inappropriate expenditure transactions we identified were included in the first large reimbursement request prepared by DHS, wh ich was based on information provided by another state agency. At the time of this reimbursement request, DHS did not have procedures in place to identify duplicate or refunded payments within the data used to support the reimbursement request. DHS sta ff indicated that subsequent reimbursement requests were prepared using DHS queries from STAR, which is the State's accounting system, that removed duplicated or refunded transactions. We did not identify issues in the other reimbursement request we reviewed. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Health Services work with the federal government to resolve the $855,368 in unallowable costs we identified. Finding 2022-300: of Finding: Noncompliance Response from the Wisconsin De partment of Health Services: The Wisconsin Department of Health Services agrees with the audit finding and recommendation. 50 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES Finding 2022-301: Medical Assistance Program\u2014Home and Community-Based Services Unallowable Costs Background: The U.S Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) provides funding to DHS for the Medical Assistance (MA) Program (A ssistance Listing number 93.778). Funding under the MA Program is used to assist st ates in maintaining and expanding health care services to certain categories of lo w-income persons. Under the MA Program, a state may obtain a waiver to provide Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS). Such a waiver may permit an individual to receive services in their own home or community rather than in institutions or ot her isolated settings. Under 1915(c) of the Social Security Act, Wisconsin has an a pproved waiver to administer the Include, Respect, I Self-Direct (IRIS) program. This program provides services to MA-eligible adults that facilitates participant choice, di rection, and control over services designed to provide HCBS services as an alternative to institutional care. During FY 2021-22, DHS contracted with se ven independent consulting agencies (ICA) that assisted IRIS participants in developi ng individual support and service plans that will meet each participant's needs within the participant's approved IRIS annual budget. Included in this plan are authorizat ions for specific services, the name of the entity or individuals to provide the goods or services, and the amount or frequency of goods or services. For example, a plan may include services that will be provided by a caretaker and could include the provider name , number of hours for a specific period, and the billing rate. These plans are appr oved by the ICA, with additional DHS approval required for certain services. DHS al so contracted with four fiscal employer agents (FEAs) that are responsible for re viewing invoices in accordance with the approved individual support and service pl an and for making payments. This review may include payments for services based upon an invoice or review of timesheets to support that the services were provided to the participant. The FEA submits to DHS information related to the approved payme nts, and DHS makes funds available to enable the FEA to make the payments. DHS reviews the total payment requests it received from each FEA before transferring fu nds to the FEA for payment to providers. Criteria: The approved waiver for IRIS requires the crea tion of an individual support and service plan and for services to be provided in accordance with this service plan. DHS has established the IRIS Policy Manual , which provides guidance to FEAs on determining allowed payments and requires a review of provider claims to ensure the claims are supported by documentation and the partic ipant's approved individual support and service plan. Condition: We tested a sample of 26 payments and identified one payment for $5.60 that DHS paid during FY 2021-22 for which it could not pr ovide documentation to support that the payment was for services authorized in the participant's individual support and service plan. Context: Based on detailed payment data provided by DHS, there were approximately 12 million individual payments totaling $711. 9 million paid to providers for care or services to IRIS participants during FY 2021-22. Payments un der the program were generally small and, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES 51 based upon the data provided, averaged $59.33 per payment. We selected a random sample of 26 payments and requested supporting documentation to support the payment and the related participant's individual suppor t and service plan authorizing the goods or services. We also interviewed DHS staff on the payment process and its oversight of the entities responsible for admi nistering the IRIS program. Questioned Costs: We question the federal share of the unsupported $5.60 payment identified, or $3.70. Because our testing was based upon a sample of payments, it is likely there are additional cases where the payment is not supported. We estimate these additional questioned costs are likely over $25,000, which is required to be reported under 2 CFR 200.516. Effect: DHS did not comply with its approved waiver and inappropriately paid an IRIS provider for amounts that were not supported for the participant. Cause: Although we found the FEA approved the payment, the FEA indicated that there was an error made in entering the payment bec ause the payment was not associated with the participant identified within the clai m documentation. DHS, in reviewing the payment file from the FEA, did not review the detailed support for each individual IRIS claim payment and, therefore, DHS did not detect the error. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Dep artment of Health Services work with the fiscal employer agent that improperly approved the payment we identified to determine how this payment was made, assess whether changes to current processes are needed, document its assessment, and implement corrective actions, as appropriate. Finding 2022-301: Medical Assistance Program\u2014Home and Community Based Services Unallowable Costs Medical Assistance Program (Assistance Listing number 93.778) Award Numb ers Award Years 2105WI5MAP Costs: $3.70 Type Response from the Wisconsin De partment of Health Services: The Wisconsin Department of Health Services agrees with the audit finding and recommendation. 52 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES Finding 2022-302: Multiple Grants \u2014Reporting in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards Background: The DOA, State Controller's Office (SCO) is responsible for coordinating with the other state agencies to prepare the State of Wisc onsin Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA). The SEFA, which is required to be published in the State of Wisconsin single audit report, is a listing of all federal programs administered by an entity, includes the total expenditures for the reporting peri od, and identifies any amounts provided to subrecipients for each federal program. Each state agency, including DHS, prepares a SEFA for the federal programs that it admi nisters and provides this to DOA SCO. DOA SCO compiles the agency-level SEFAs into the statewide SEFA. DOA SCO performs desk reviews of the agency-level SEFAs to en sure the expenditures reconcile to the accounting records in STAR, which is the State's accounting system. Criteria: Under 2 CFR 200.510 (b), the State is required to prepare a SEFA for the period covered by the State's financial statements and the SEFA must include the total federal awards expended. Under 2 CFR 200.502, the dete rmination of when a federal award is expended must be based on when the activity related to the federal award occurs. Further, 2 CFR 200.514 indicates that the fi nancial statements and SEFA must be for the same audit period. Finally, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Compliance Supplement , recipients and subrecipients of federal funding provided under the COVID-19 Emergency Ac ts, which includes funding the State received under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), must separately identify the COVID-19 expenditures in the SEFA. Further, in its instructions to state agencies, DOA identified that separate reporting of COVID-19 Emergency Acts expenditures was required. Condition: We identified four concerns in our review of the DHS FY 2021-22 SEFA. First, we found DHS did not separately identify $329.2 mill ion in FY 2021-22 expenditures as COVID-19 MA Program expenditures related to the enha nced federal medical assistance percentage for home and community-based se rvices authorized under ARPA. Second, transferred $55.9 million in FY 2020-21 expenditures from the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capaci ty for Infectious Diseases (ELC) grant (Assistance Listing number 93.323) to the Disaster Grants\u2014Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) grant. In the STAR General Ledger, the prior-year transferred expenditures resulted in a re duction in the ELC grant expenditures. In reporting these amounts in the FY 2021- 22 SEFA, DHS did not make a subsequent adjustment to remove the expenditure adjustment from the total expenditures reported for the ELC grant. Third, DHS did not report all CSLFRF expe nditures it incurred in FY 2021-22. DHS requested reimbursement from DOA as it incurred expenditures under the CSLFRF grant. In its FY 2021-22 SEFA, DHS report ed $161.9 million in CSLFRF expenditures, which was the total expenditures for which it had received reimbursement from DOA. However, DHS had actually incurred $173.6 million in CSLFRF expenditures in FY 2021-22. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES 53 Finally, DHS included a $2.6 million repa yment of a prior-year overpayment as an expenditure for the WIC Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children grant. This should have been excluded from total expenditures because it did not relate to FY 2021-22 program expenditures. Context: The State administered and reported in it s SEFA $20.2 billion in federal financial assistance in FY 2021-22. DHS administered $1 1.9 billion in federal financial assistance in FY 2021-22. We reviewed the DHS SEFA to assess the reported expenditures, particularly for major programs. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: Although total expenditures for the MA Pr ogram were accurately reported, DHS did not accurately report $329.2 million as COVID-19 expenditures separately in the SEFA. Further, DHS underreported expendit ures by expenditures by $11.7 million for CSLFRF, and overreported expenditure by $2.6 million for the WIC Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children grant program. Cause: DHS did not consider the new enhanced fe deral funding it received for home and community-based services as amounts th at should be identified as COVID-19 expenditures when compiling the SEFA. DHS so ught to reflect the expenditures for the grant programs based on the amounts record ed in the STAR General Ledger. However, DHS did not consider that the negative expe nditures resulting from the transfers of FY 2020-21 expenditures led to the underreporting of the ELC grant expenditures in the DHS SEFA. Further, for the CSLFRF grant, DHS indicated that it thought it was appropriate to report only what had be en reimbursed by DOA. Finally, DHS overlooked the inclusion of a repayment of a prior-year overpayment when reporting its expenditures for the WIC Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children grant program. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Health Services further evaluate federal grant expenditures reported in the STAR Gene ral Ledger as it prepares its schedule of expenditures of federal aw ards and ensure it is: properly identifying applicable COVID-19 expenditures; adjusting expenditures for prior-year transfers of expenditures in the current year; reporting all federal expenditures for each federal grant program, regardless of whether the agency has received reimbursement from the pass-through entity; and removing repayments of prior-year overpayments of expenditures from current-year expenditures. 54 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES Finding 2022-302: Multiple Grants \u2014Reporting in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards WIC Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (Assistance Listing number 10.557) Award Number Award Year 16W1006 2016 COVID-19\u2014Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (Assistance Listing number 21.027) Award Number Award Year None 2021 COVID-19\u2014Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Infectious Diseases (ELC) (Assistance Listing number 93.323) Award Numbers Award Years 6 NU50CK000534-01-06 2020 6 NU50CK000534-01-07 2020 6 NU50CK000534-01-08 6 Epidemiology and Capacity for Infectious Diseases (ELC) (Assistance Listing number 93.323) Award Numbers Award Years 6 NU50CK000534-01-00 2020 6 NU50CK000534-01-01 2020 6 NU50CK000534-02-00 2021 COVID-19\u2014Medical Assistance Program (Assistance Award Years 2105WI5MAP 2021 2205WI5MAP 2022 Medical Assistance Program (Assistance Award Years 2105WI5MAP 2021 2205WI5MAP 2022 Questioned Costs: None DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES 55 Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency, Noncompliance Response from the Wisconsin De partment of Health Services: The Wisconsin Department of Health Services agrees wi th the audit finding and recommendations. Finding 2022-303: Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Reporting\u2014Immunization Cooperative Agreements Background: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides funding to DHS for the Immunization Cooperative Agreements program. DHS provided a portion of this pr ogram to subrecipients during FY 2021-22. The Immunization Cooperative Agreements program subawards of $30,000 or more are subject to Federal Funding Accounta bility and Transparency Act (FFATA) reporting. The intent of FFATA is to prov ide information about federal awards to allow the public access to the information to hold the government accountable for decisions. Criteria: Under 2 CFR s. 170, DHS is required to report in the FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) subawards of $30,000 or more, including any amendments or modifications to a subaward. This reporting is to be completed no later than the last day of the month following the month in which the subaward was made. For example, if DHS signed a subaward contract on July 1, 2021, it must be reported in FSRS no later than August 31, 2021. During FY 2021-22, DHS staff would periodically identify subawards required to be reported using information compiled through queries of contracts established through DHS's Communi ty Aids Reporting System (CARS) and queries of purchase orders established in ST AR, which is the State's accounting system. Condition: We identified two concerns with DHS's FFATA reporting du ring FY 2021-22. First, we found that four of the five subawards we reviewed that DHS had initiated through a purchase order in STAR were not reported in FSRS prior to our request in March 2023. The one subaward that was reported in FSRS was reported one month later than required. Second, we found that seven of the eight subawards we reviewed that DHS had initiated through CARS were not reported in FSRS in a timely manner and one had not been reported. For example, we found that five of the seven subawards were submitted more than one month later than required. Context: During FY 2021-22, DHS expended $94.8 mi llion under the Immunization Cooperative Agreements program, of which $16.9 millio n was provided to subrecipients. We interviewed DHS staff to gain an unders tanding of the procedures for compiling information for subawards and for reportin g the information in FSRS. For FY 2021-22, we selected 5 of the 119 subawards over $3 0,000 that DHS initiated through a purchase order in STAR and 8 of the 61 subawards over $30,000 that DHS initiated through CARS. We requested screenshots from FSRS for ea ch subaward to assess if the subaward was reported in an accurate and timely matter. 56 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES Questioned Costs: None. Effect: DHS did not comply with FFATA requirements for the reporting of subawards in FSRS. Cause: The queries DHS used to identify the subawar ds it initiated through a STAR purchase order did not accurately identify all applic able subawards subject to FFATA reporting. DHS indicated that it did not prioritize FFATA reporting to identify or review information that was required to be reported in FSRS to ensure all subawards were reported in a timely manner. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Depa rtment of Health Services: update the queries used to iden tify subawards in the State's accounting system, STAR, that are subject to Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act reporting to ensure all required subawards are identified; and ensure all required subawards of $30,000 or more, including any amendments or modifications to a subaward, are identified and submitted to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System in a timely manner.

Finding 2022-304: Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds\u2014 Monitoring of Local and Tribal Health Department Response and Recovery Support Program Expenditures Background: The State was advanced $1.3 billion in CSLFRF in May 2021 and another $1.3 billion in May 2022. CSLFRF was created under the Amer ican Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and is administered by DOA. CSLFRF funding has certain stipulations, including that the funds must be used to: respond to the public health emer gency or its negative economic impacts; respond to the needs of workers perf orming essential work during the public health emergency; provide government services to the extent revenue losses due to the public health emergency reduced revenues; and make necessary investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure. Further, federal regulations stipulate that eligible expenditures must be incurred between March 3, 2021, and December 31, 2024, and funds must be spent through December 31, 2026. DOA entered into a memorandum of understa nding with DHS to administer the Local and Tribal Health Department Response and Recovery Support program, which provides grants to local and tribal health departments for costs incurred to respond to the public health emergency. DHS entered into contracts with 98 local and tribal health departments. The contracts stipulat e the allowable uses of the funding and reporting requirements. After incurring expenditures, the health departments may request reimbursement on a monthly basis using DHS's CARS. Criteria: In accordance with 2 CFR s. 200.303, DH S is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over federal awards that provides reasonable assurance that it is managing federal awar ds in compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of federal awards. Further, under U.S. Department of the Treasury Final Rule (31 CFR Part 35), DHS must establish rigorous oversight and internal control processes to monitor compliance with any applicable requirements of CSLFRF funding. The contracts between DHS and each of th e public health departments require the health departments to submit a quarterly report. DHS indicated that the quarterly report includes a list of expenditures for the quarter, a list of payroll costs, and a description of the uses of the funds, and it is due within 30 days of the end of the 58 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES quarter. DHS tracks the receipt and review of the quarterly reports in a tracking spreadsheet. DHS indicated that it compar es the reported expenditures in the quarterly report to the monthly reimbursement request data from CARS to ensure the amounts agree. Further, DHS indicated that it reviews the description of the uses of the funding from the quarterly report to evaluate the allowability of the reported expenses. DHS indicated that quarterly reports are required regardless of whether the public health department incurred expenditures during the quarter. Condition: DHS did not have documentation to support th at it was reviewing the quarterly reports and following its procedures to provide over sight over the expenditures charged to the program in FY 2021-22. We attempted to review 20 quarterly reports filed in FY 2021-22 for 10 public health departments. We identified two concerns. First, we found that the City of Milwaukee Public Health Department did not submit the two quarterly reports that were due in FY 2021-22. Therefore, DHS did not have documentation that it evaluated whether fund ing was expended on allowable activities under the grant program. The City of Mi lwaukee was reimbursed $3.6 million in expenditures in January 2022. On March 3, 2023, DHS put a hold on any further reimbursements to the City of Milwaukee Pu blic Health Department until the issues with the missing quarterly reports are reso lved. Second, we found that 12 of the remaining 18 quarterly reports we reviewed were submitted to DHS more than six months after the due date. Five of the 12 re ports were dated after we made our request for the reports in February 2023. We also reviewed reports for the quarter en ded June 30, 2022, for the 10 public health departments we selected for review. For three health departments, we found there were differences between the amounts reported to date on the quarterly reports and the total reimbursement provided by DHS as of the end of that quarter. DHS did not have documentation to show that it id entified and resolved these differences. Context: DHS was awarded $58.4 millio n in CSLFRF funds for the Local and Tribal Health Department Response and Recovery Support program. The public health departments are considered beneficiaries under the prog ram and, as such, this funding is not subject to the local or tribal government si ngle audits. In FY 2021-22, DHS reimbursed the public health departments $6.7 million in expenditures for the program. The program ends on December 31, 2024. We reviewed the quarterly reports filed in FY 2021-22 for 10 of the 98 public health departments that were allocated funding for this program. We randomly selected 7 pu blic health departments and selected the remaining three public health department s using a judgement sample based on a review of DHS's quarterly report tracking spreadsheet. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: Because DHS controls related to the quarterly report are not working effectively, there is an increased risk of improper paymen ts made using the CSLFRF grant funding. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES 59 Cause: DHS did not have written policies and proced ures for the tracking and review of the reports. In addition, DHS did not have docu mentation to support that it was tracking the timely receipt and review of the quarterly reports in FY 2021-22. At the end of FY 2021-22, DHS experien ced turnover in staff responsible for administering the Local and Tribal Heal th Department Response and Recovery Support program. DHS indicated that the staff responsible for administering the program in FY 2021-22 did not document re views of the quarterly reports. In a March 2, 2023 email to DHS, staff from the City of Milwaukee Public Health Department indicated that DHS staff had agreed to permit emails to explain the expenditure of funds in lieu of the quarterly reports. DHS did not provide these emails or other documentation to support this permission. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Depa rtment of Health Services: develop and implement written policie s and procedures for the review and tracking of the quarterly reports used to monitor expenditures under the Local and Tribal Health Departme nt Response and Recovery Support program; maintain the quarterly reports, docu ment its review of the quarterly reports, and document its corresp ondence with the public health departments regarding resoluti on of reporting variances; review the contracts with the public health departments and determine whether any revisions are needed to clarify expectations for documentation and timeliness of filing the quarterl y reports; and ensure it obtains quarterly reports to support the payments it made to the City of Milwaukee Public Health Department.

It also provides assistance for the development and improvement of public and school libraries. In FY 2021- 22, DPI administered $1.5 billion in federal financial assistance. We tested DPI's internal controls and compliance with grant requirements for two type A programs: Supporting Effectiv e Instruction State Grants (SEI) (formerly Improving Teacher Quality State Grants) (A ssistance Listing number 84.367) and the Education Stabilization Fund (Assistance List ing number 84.425). In addition, we tested internal controls and compliance with gran t requirements for a type B program from which DPI received funding from the Wiscon sin Technical College System: the Career and Technical Education\u2014Basic Grants to States (Assistance Listing number 84.048). We identified the following internal control and compliance concern: Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants\u2014Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Reporting (Finding 2022-400). In addition, we followed up on the progre ss of DPI in addressing Finding 2021-400 and 2021-401 of our FY 2020-21 audit (report 22-5) . DPI implemented corrective actions to partially address these findings. It will be important for DPI to continue to work to resolve these findings. The Summary Schedu le of Prior Audit Findings, which is prepared by management, begins on page 111 an d describes the status of the findings as of the end of our audit period as well as ongoing steps to address findings that were not fully corrected. Department of Public Instruction 62 DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Finding 2022-400: Supporting Effect ive Instruction State Grants\u2014 Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Reporting Background: The U.S. Department of Education provides funding to DPI through the SEI program in Title II, Part A of the Elementary and Seco ndary Education Act (ESEA), as amended by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The pu rpose of the grant program is to provide assistance to schools to in crease student achievement and close achievement gaps by offering professional development oppo rtunities in core academic areas. SEI subawards of $30,000 or more are subjec t to Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) reporting. The in tent of FFATA is to provide information about federal awards to allow the public access to the information to hold the government accountable for decisions. In re port 22-5, we reported concerns with DPI's procedures and controls over FFATA reporting for a different grant program (Finding 2021-401). We recommended that DP I improve its FFATA submission process to ensure all required subawards of $30,00 0 or more, including any amendments or modifications to a subaward, are identifi ed and reported in a timely manner. Criteria: Under 2 CFR s. 170, DPI is required to repo rt in the FFATA Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) subawards of $30,000 or more, includin g any amendments or modifications to a subaward. This reporting is to be submitted no later than the last day of the month following the month in which the subaward was made. For example, if the subaward was made on November 7, 2021, it must be reported in FSRS not later than December 31, 2021. DPI identifies subawards required to be reported in FSRS using information from DPI's subaward tracking system. Condition: We found that none of the 40 SEI subawards we reviewed were reported in a timely manner in FSRS. All 40 subawards were made in July 2021 and should have been reported in FSRS by August 31, 2021. Howe ver, DPI did not report 38 of the subawards in FSRS until October 2021. In addition , we found 2 of the 40 SEI subawards we reviewed were not reported until February 2023 when we identified them to DPI. Context: During FY 2021-22, DPI expended $32.8 mi llion under SEI of which $31.3 million was provided to subrecipients. DPI awarded 451 SEI subawards during FY 2021-22. We interviewed DPI staff to gain an unders tanding of the procedures for compiling information for subawards and submitting the information in FSRS. We requested screenshots from FSRS and subaward do cumentation from DPI to support the information reported for FFATA. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: DPI did not comply with FFATA requirements for the timely reporting of subawards in FSRS. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 63 Cause: Although DPI took corrective action in re sponding to Finding 2021-401, which was included in report 22-5, the improved inte rnal controls were not in place for all of FY 2021-22. For example, DPI implemented improvements to its FFATA submission process by July 2022, which was subsequent to the 40 subawards we identified that DPI was required to report in FSRS in August 2021. These improvements included making enhancements to its grant tracking system to create a report identifying subawards required to be reported under FFATA and de veloping an approval tracking document that is reviewed monthly by a supervisor. DPI completed initial subawards for SEI su brecipients in July 2021 and finalized the amounts for the subawards in September 2021. DPI then reported 38 of the SEI subawards in FSRS in October 2021. For th e two SEI subawards we identified that were not reported until February 2023, DPI indicated that an error occurred during the October 2021 submission process that prevented these subawards from being uploaded to FSRS. Although subsequent manual entry was attempted, DPI staff indicated that follow-up on the two subawar ds did not occur when the manual entry was unsuccessful. At that time, other detective procedures were not in place to identify that FFATA reporting had not occurred for the two subawards. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Depart ment of Public Instruction: report in a timely manner all a pplicable subawards greater than $30,000 and subject to Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act reporting when initiated in the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System; ensure all rejected submissions are detected and corrected in a timely manner; and continue to enhance the internal controls it implemented to its Federal Funding Accountability an d Transparency Act submission process to ensure all required subawards of $30,000 or more, including any amendments or mo difications to a subaward, are identified in a timely manner an d submitted to the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System. Finding 2022-400: Supporting Effectiv e Instruction State Grants\u2014Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Reporting Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants (formerly Improving Teacher Quality State Grants) (Assistance Listing number 84.367) Award Number Award Period S367A210047 7/1/2021-9/30/2022 Questioned Costs: None Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency, Noncompliance 64 DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION Response from the Wisconsin Depa rtment of Public Instruction: The Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction agrees with the audit finding and recommendations. 65 The Department of Workforce Developm ent (DWD) administers programs for unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, equal rights in employment and housing, apprenticeship job training, empl oyment services and training, vocational rehabilitation, and other related progra ms. Excluding unemployment insurance benefits, federal grants funded $274.3 million of DWD's FY 2021-22 expenditures. In addition, the Wisconsin Unemployment Reserve Fund paid $339.0 million in regular unemployment insurance benefits and $333.6 million in federally funded benefits. We tested DWD's internal controls and comp liance with grant requirements for two type A programs: Unemployment Insurance (UI) (Assistance Listing number 17.225) and Rehabilitation Services Vocational Reha bilitation Grants to States (Assistance Listing number 84.126). We also tested the Employment Service Cluster (Assistance Listing numbers 17.207/17.801), which is a type B program. We identified the following internal control and compliance concern: Unemployment Insurance Program\u2014Reporting (Finding 2022-600). In addition, we followed up on the progre ss of DWD in addressing Findings 2021-600 through 2021-602 of our FY 2020-21 audit (report 22-5) audit (report address Findings 2021-601, 2021-602 and 2020-600 and to partially address 2021-600. We also followed up on the progress of DWD in addressing financial reporting concerns related to its use of predictive analytics for the UI program (Finding 2021-003 of report 22-5) and access controls over UI program system s (Finding 2021-004 of report 22-5). DWD implemented corrective actions to partia lly address Finding 2021-003, and it took corrective actions to address Finding 2021- 004. It will be important for DWD to continue to work to resolve this findin g. The Summary Schedule of Prior Audit Findings, which is prepared by managem ent, begins on page 111 and describes the status of each finding as of the end of ou r audit period as well as ongoing steps to address findings that were not fully corrected. Department of Workforce Development 66 DEPARTMENT OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT Finding 2022-600: Unemployment Insurance Program\u2014Reporting Background: As a part of its administration of the UI program, DWD is required to complete and submit multiple performance and special reports to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), including the monthly ETA 9052, Nonmonetary Determination Time Lapse Detection . These reports contain information rela ted to Wisconsin's UI program that assist DOL in evaluating the performance of the program and contain information that is of interest to DOL. In our prior audit, we found that DWD did not establish adequate procedures to ensure the accuracy of the performance and special reports. In April 2022, we recommended that DWD develop and implement adequat e procedures for the preparation and review of the UI performance and special reports to ensure the accuracy of the amounts reported to the federal government . We also recommended that DWD retain documentation to support the amounts included in each report it submits to the federal government (Finding 2021-600). Criteria: Under 2 CFR s. 200.303, DWD is required to establish and maintain effective internal controls over its federal programs to prov ide reasonable assurance that the federal programs are administered in compliance with federal statutes and regulations as well as the terms and conditions of its federal awards. This includes effective internal controls over the preparation of reports for the federal government. Condition: During our current audit, and after April 2022, we found DWD improved its procedures for the preparation and review of the UI performance and special reports, and it retained documentation to support the amount s included in each report it submitted to the federal government. However, for those reports that DWD submitted to the federal government prior to our recommenda tions in April 2022, we continued to find that the supporting documentation DWD prov ided did not agree with the amounts it reported on the ETA 9052 performance report. Specifically, we identified that for the November 2021 ETA 9052 performance report we reviewed, the amounts reported for 35 of 110 key line items reviewed did no t agree with the supporting documentation provided. Context: We interviewed DWD staff to gain an unde rstanding of the procedures for preparing the UI program performance and special reports. During FY 2021-22, DWD was required to submit 12 ETA 9050 performance reports, 12 ETA 9052 performance reports, and 4 ETA 2208A special reports to DOL. We reviewed: the ETA 9050 performance reports submitted for the months of November 2021 and April 2022; the ETA 9052 performance reports submitted for the months of November 2021, April 2022, and May 2022; and the March 2022 quarterly ETA 2208A special report. DEPARTMENT OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT 67 We also requested DWD's documentation to support the reported information for each section or amount identified by the federa l government as a key section or key line item. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: DWD cannot be assured that it reported comp lete and accurate information during the entire fiscal year to enable DOL to asse ss the outcomes of Wisconsin's UI program. Cause: Prior to April 2022, which is when we commu nicated our concerns with the accuracy of the ETA 9052 performance report, DWD did not establish adequate procedures to ensure the accuracy of the report. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development continue to make progress in developing and implementing ad equate procedures for the preparation and review of the Unemployment Insurance prog ram's performance reports to ensure the accuracy of the amounts report ed to the federal government.

Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency, Noncompliance Response from the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development: The Wisconsin Department of Workforce Develo pment agrees with th e audit finding and recommendation. 69 The University of Wisconsin (UW) System provides postsecondary academic education for approximately 163,000 students. UW Syst em includes 13 four-year universities, 13 two-year branch campuses associated with a university, and UW System Administration. Each of the 13 universities awards bachelor's and master's degrees, and several also confer doctoral degrees. The 13 two-year branch campuses offer general education associate degrees and co urse credits that transfer to other degreegranting universities. UW System Admini stration consists of the UW System President's staff who assist the Board of Regents in establishing and monitoring systemwide policies, financial planning for the system, and maintaining fiscal control. In FY 2021-22, UW System administered $2. 0 billion in federal financial assistance. We tested UW System's internal controls an d compliance with grant requirements for two type A programs: the Education Stabilization Fund (Assistance Listing number 84.425) and Research and Development Cluste r (various Assistance Listing numbers). We identified the following internal control and compliance concerns: Research and Development Cluster\u2014Physical Inventory Requirements for Federal Eq uipment (Finding 2022-700); Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund\u2014UW-La Crosse Institutional Aid Allowable Costs (Finding 2022-701); Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund\u2014UW-Platteville Institutional Aid Allowable Costs (Finding 2022-702); Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund\u2014UW-Superior Institutional Aid Allowable Costs (Finding 2022-703); and Research and Development Cluster\u2014Unallowable Costs (Finding 2022-704). University of Wisconsin System 70 UW SYSTEM In report 22-26, we reported finding 2022- 007 as significant deficiency for the State's FY 2021-22 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR). This finding is also considered a significant deficiency in internal controls over compliance for the Research and Development Cluster. This find ing included concerns with UW System's internal controls related to a new computer application implemented in April 2021. We found that UW System Administration la cked adequate policies for UW institution review of all access related to the new appl ication during FY 2021-22. We also found that UW System Administration had not obtain ed a service organization audit report to assess the internal controls of a third-pa rty vendor for the new application. We recommend UW System Administration de velop policies to require such access reviews, monitor that the reviews are comp leted in a timely manner, and obtain and review service organization audit reports for third-party vendors. In addition, we followed up on the prog ress of UW System Administration in addressing financial reporting concerns re lated to information technology security controls (Finding 2021-002 fro m report 22-5). UW implemented corrective actions to address Finding 2021-002. The Summary Schedu le of Prior Audit Findings, which is prepared by management, begins on page 111 an d describes the status of each finding as of the end of our audit period as well as ongoing steps to address findings that were not fully corrected. We also included the Wisconsin Humaniti es Council in our FY 2021-22 audit of UW System. The Wisconsin Humanities Counci l is a nonprofit organization associated with UW System, which is responsible for th e fiscal and personnel administration of the Wisconsin Humanities Council. We test ed internal controls and compliance with grant requirements for the Promotion of the Humanities\u2014Federal/State Partnership (Assistance Listing number 45.129) grant. Finding 2022-700: Research and De velopment Cluster\u2014Physical Requirements for Federal Equipment Background: During FY 2021-22, UW institutions were awarded $741.6 million in federal funding as part of the Research and Development Clus ter, for which UW-Madison expended the majority of the funding. UW-Madison used a portion of these federal funds, and similar funding from prior years, to purchase equipme nt needed for research activities. When UW-Madison purchases equipment using federa l funding (federal equipment), it must maintain comprehensive records of each federal equipment item, periodically conduct a physical inventory of the equipment, and reim burse the federal agency that originally funded the equipment purchase with any pr oceeds from the disposal of the equipment no longer needed for research activities. Criteria: Under 2 CFR s. 200.313 (d) (2), UW-Madison is required to biennially complete a physical inventory of all federal equipment and reconcile the results with its records. UW System Policy 334, Accountability for Capital Equipment , and UW-Madison Procedure 3008.6, Physical Inventory Procedure, require biennial physical inventories of federal equipment. To comply with thes e policies and procedures, UW-Madison has assigned central accounting staff the respon sibility for tracking federal equipment and scheduling physical inventories. Staff wi thin various UW-Madison departments are responsible for safekeeping the equipment, loca ting items during physical inventories, UW SYSTEM 71 and authorizing disposal when specific equipment is no longer useful. Under 2 CFR s. 200.313 (e) UW-Madison is required to potentially provide repayment to the federal agency that originally funded the equipment purchase when federal equipment is no longer needed fo r research activities. Condition: UW-Madison did not perform a physical inve ntory of all federal equipment during the period from July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2022. Context: Based on available records, UW-Madison repo rted a total federal equipment acquisition value of $332.9 million as of June 30, 2022. Based on these records, and from July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2022, UW-Madison had 7,102 federal equipment items subject to the biennial physical inventory requirement. UW-Madison performed a physical inventory of 2,688 federal equipment items from July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2022, but during this period it did not perform a physical inventory of 4,414 federal equipment items (62.2 percent). We discussed UW-Madison's procedures with the central accounting staff responsible for scheduli ng physical inventories of UW-Madison departments, obtained documentation of physical inventories UW-Madison performed, and conducted other testing of UW-Madison's management of federal equipment. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: Without completion of regular physical inve ntories of federal equipment, UW-Madison is at increased risk of theft or loss of equipment, it cannot be assured that federal equipment records were accurately maintained, and it may not be aware of all equipment disposals or losses, which may result in a fa ilure to reimburse the federal agency that originally funded the equipment purcha se with any proceeds from its disposal. Cause: Due to staffing turnover of both central accounting staff and department staff, UW-Madison indicated that it waived th e requirement to perform physical inventories of equipment items by June 30, 2022. However, UW-Madison did not provide documentation of the waiver or federa l approval to waive this requirement. We found two of the four UW-Madison ce ntral accounting positions experienced turnover in spring 2021, which contributed to a backlog in the physical inventories UW-Madison had planned to complete during FY 2020-21. As a result, during FY 2021-22 UW-Madison central accounting staff stated that they focused on eliminating the backlog rather than on in itiating new physical inventories at certain departments. Given the volume of equipment managed by UW-Madison and the various locations of the equipment, it is important that physical inventories are performed regularly to limit the risk of theft or loss of federal equipment. Recommendation We recommend the University of Wisconsin- Madison conduct physical inventories of federal equipment as required by federal regulations and its existing policies and procedures, or seek a waiver from the federal cognizant agency. 72 UW SYSTEM Finding 2022-700: Research and Deve lopment Cluster\u2014Physical Inventory Requirements for Federal Equipment Research and Development Cluster (various Assistance Listing numbers) Award Numbers Award Years Various Various Questioned Costs: None Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency, Noncompliance Response from the Universi ty of Wisconsin-Madison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison agrees with the audit finding and recommendation. Finding 2022-701: Higher Educat ion Emergency Relief Fund\u2014 UW-La Crosse Institutio nal Aid Allowable Costs Background: In prior fiscal years, UW institutions were awarded federal funding from the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) , which was established and funded by federal legislation. For example, in May 2021, the U.S. Department of Education allocated $271.4 million in American Rescue Pl an Act (ARPA) funds to UW institutions to be used for student aid (Assistance List ing number 84.425E) and institutional aid (Assistance Listing number 84.425F). osse received an allo cation that totaled $35.3 million, of which $19.4 million co uld be used for institutional aid. Criteria: Under 2 CFR s. 200.303, UW-La Crosse is resp onsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over federal awar ds to provide reasonable assurance that federal awards are managed in compliance wi th federal statutes, regulations, and the award terms and conditions. Under ARPA, UW institutions are required to use a portion of the allocated HEERF funds to make direct aid payments to students and may use a portion of the allocated funds to defray institutional expenses associated with the coronavirus, including lost revenue. Se ction 314 of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, gu idance from the Department of Education, the agreements each UW institution signed with the U.S. Department of Education, and the federal Office of Management and Budget's Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Au dit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) prohibit UW institutions from using the funds to cover certain costs, including those for student recruitment. Condition: UW-La Crosse used a total of $127,448 of it s HEERF institutional aid allocation for consulting, advertising, and recruitment costs to increase student enrollment. UW SYSTEM 73 Context: During FY 2021-22, UW-La Crosse used $2.9 million of its total HEERF institutional aid allocation. We reviewed 151 transact ions for which UW-La Crosse used HEERF institutional aid, including the largest 10 tr ansactions made using funds appropriated by ARPA. We reviewed whether each tran saction met the requirements of federal legislation, guidance from the U.S. Depart ment of Education, the agreements UW-La Crosse signed with the U.S. Depart ment of Education, and Uniform Guidance. To complete our testing, we requested in formation or supporting documentation for each transaction and interviewed UW-La Crosse staff. Questioned Costs: $127,448 Effect: Because unallowable costs were charged to HEERF, UW-La Crosse was not in compliance with federal requirements fo r the use of its HEERF institutional aid allocation. UW-La Crosse received fe deral reimbursement $127,448 for unallowable costs during FY 2021-22. Cause: UW-La Crosse interpreted the federal guidance to permit the costs for which it used its HEERF institutional aid allocation because the intention of the services was to increase enrollment that had declined during the publ ic health emergency. After we questioned the use of HEERF funds, UW-La Crosse subsequently returned the funding. Recommendation We recommend the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse ensure that all expenses charged to the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) program are allowable, such as performing an additional review of those costs allocated to HEERF and document the performance of such a review. Finding 2022-701: Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund\u2014UW-La Crosse Institutional Aid Allowable Costs COVID-19\u2014Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (Assistance Listing number 84.425F) Award Number Award Noncompliance Response the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse: The University of Wisconsin-La Crosse agrees with the audit finding and recommendation. 74 UW SYSTEM Finding 2022-702: Higher Educat ion Emergency Relief Fund\u2014 UW-Platteville Institutio nal Aid Allowable Costs Background: In prior fiscal years, UW institutions we re awarded federal funding from HEERF, which was established and funded by federal legisl ation. For example, in May 2021, the U.S. Department of Education allocated $271.4 million in ARPA funds to UW institutions to be used for student aid and institutional aid. UW -Platteville received an allocation that totaled $26.4 million, of which $14.5 million could be used for institutional aid. Criteria: Under 2 CFR s. 200.303, UW-Platteville is resp onsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over federal awar ds to provide reasonable assurance that federal awards are managed in compliance wi th federal statutes, regulations, and the award terms and conditions. Under ARPA, UW institutions are required to use a portion of the allocated HEERF funds to make direct aid payments to students and may use a portion of the allocated funds to defra y institutional expenses associated with coronavirus, including lost revenue. Se ction 314 of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, gu idance from the Department of Education, the agreements each UW institution signed with the U.S. Department of Education, and Uniform Guidance prohibit UW institut ions from using the funds to cover certain costs, including those for student recruitment and entertainment. Condition: UW-Platteville used $23,500 of its HEERF instit utional aid allocation to create online tours of its campuses for recruiting purpos es and $1,018 for student entertainment for a summer 2021 program. Context: During FY 2021-22, UW-Platteville used $6.4 million of its total HEERF institutional aid allocation. We reviewed 13 transactio ns for which UW-Platteville used HEERF institutional aid, including the largest 10 tr ansactions made using funds appropriated by ARPA. We reviewed whether each tran saction met the requirements of federal legislation, guidance from the U.S. Depa rtment of Education, the agreements UW-Platteville signed with the U.S. Depart ment of Education, and Uniform Guidance. To complete our testing, we requested supporting documentation for certain transactions and interviewed UW-Platteville staff. Questioned Costs: $24,518 Effect: Because unallowable costs were charged to HEERF, UW-Platteville was not in compliance with federal requirements fo r the use of its HEERF institutional aid allocation. UW-Platteville received federal reimbursement of $24,518 for unallowable costs during FY 2021-22. Cause: UW-Platteville indicated it used HEERF institutional aid funding for online tours in order to provide prospective students an alternative way to learn about the campus. UW-Platteville indicated it interpreted the federal guidance to permit such use of UW SYSTEM 75 HEERF institutional aid. However, we fo und the tour content was predominately marketing because it included encouragemen t for viewers to enroll at UW-Platteville. We consider any activities that encour age enrollment to be re cruiting activity prohibited under federal regulations. After we questioned the use of HEERF funds for the presemester entertainment event, UW-Platteville subsequently returned the funding for this expense. Recommendation We recommend the University of Wisconsin-Platteville: work with the federal government to resolve the $23,500 in unallowable costs that we identified; and ensure that all expenses charged to the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) program are allo wable, such as performing an additional review of those costs allocated to HEERF and document the performance of such a review.

Finding 2022-703: Higher Educat ion Emergency Relief Fund\u2014 UW-Superior Institutional Aid Allowable Costs Background: In prior fiscal years, UW institutions we re awarded federal funding from HEERF, which was established and funded by federal legisl ation. For example, in May 2021, the U.S. Department of Education allocated $271.4 million in ARPA funds to UW institutions to be used for student aid and institutional aid. UW-Superior received an allocation that totaled $8.8 million, of which $4.9 million could be used for institutional aid. Criteria: Under 2 CFR s. 200.303, UW-Superior is resp onsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over federal awar ds to provide reasonable assurance that federal awards are managed in compliance wi th federal statutes, regulations, and the 76 UW SYSTEM award terms and conditions. Under ARPA, UW institutions are required to use a portion of the allocated HEERF funds to make direct aid payments to students and may use a portion of the allocated funds to defray institutional expenses associated with the coronavirus, including lost revenue. Se ction 314 of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, gu idance from the Department of Education, the agreements each UW institution signed with the U.S. Department of Education, and Uniform Guidance prohibit UW institut ions from using the funds to cover certain costs, including those for alcohol and entertainment. Condition: During FY 2021-22, UW-Superior used $30,376 of its HEERF institut ional aid allocation to offset lost revenue from the sale of alco hol at sporting and other events and $1,500 for student entertainment for a presemester summer event. Context: During FY 2021-22, UW-Superior used $2.4 mi llion of its total H EERF institutional aid allocation. We reviewed 26 transactio ns for which UW-Superior used HEERF institutional aid, including the largest 10 tr ansactions made using funds appropriated by ARPA. We reviewed whether each tran saction met the requirements of federal legislation, guidance from the U.S. Depa rtment of Education, the agreements UW-Superior signed with the U.S. Departme nt of Education, and Uniform Guidance. To complete our testing, we requested in formation or supporting documentation for each transaction and interviewed UW-Superior staff. Questioned Costs: $31,876 Effect: Because unallowable costs were charged to HEERF, UW-Superior was not in compliance with federal requirements fo r the use of its HEERF institutional aid allocation. UW-Superior received federal reimbursement of $31,876 for unallowable costs during FY 2021-22. Cause: UW-Superior indicated it was aware that alco hol sales should be excluded from lost revenue calculations and agreed that it ha d incorrectly included a cost center for alcohol sales in its FY 2021-22 lost revenue ca lculation. When this issue was identified during the audit, UW-Superior subsequentl y adjusted the accounting records in November 2022 to make $30,376 av ailable to fund additional lost revenues under the HEERF program. In December 2022, UW -Superior also adjusted the accounting records to make the $1,500 in costs for th e student entertainment available to fund additional HEERF program expenses. Recommendation We recommend the University of Wisconsin-Supe rior ensure that all expenses charged to the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (HEERF) program are allowable, such as performing an additional review of those costs allocated to HEERF and document the performance of such a review. UW SYSTEM 77 Finding 2022-703: Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund\u2014UW-Superior Institutional Aid Allowable Costs COVID-19\u2014Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund (Assistance Listing number 84.425F) Award Number Award of Finding: Noncompliance Response from the University of Wisconsin-Superior : The University of Wisconsin-Superior agrees with the audit finding and recommendation. Finding 2022-704: Research and Devel opment Cluster\u2014Unallowable UW institutions were awarded $741.6 million in federal funding as part of the Research and Development Clus ter, for which UW-Madison expended the majority of the funding. UW-Madison purc hases a variety of supplies and other goods or services to conduct its research activities. Criteria: Under 2 CFR s. 200.303, UW-Madison is resp onsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over federal awards that provides reasonable assurance that it is managing federal awards in compliance wi th federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of federal awards. Furthe r, 2 CFR s. 200.405 (a) specifies that for a cost to be allocable to a federal award the cost must be incurred specifically for the federal award; benefit both the federal award and other work; be distributed in proportions; be necessary to overall institut ional operations; and be assignable, in part, to the federal award. Condition: We found that UW-Madison charged two unallowable costs to two federal awards during FY 2021-22. First, we found that UW-Madison charged $54 for facilities and maintenance expenses relating to a locati on not used for purposes related to the federal award. Second, we found that UW-M adison charged $596 in software license fees to a federal award. However, it is UW-M adison's practice to charge such fees to a nonfederal project. Context: During FY 2021-22, UW-Madison expended $86.9 million in certain nonpayroll expenses using federal Research and Development Cluster funding. There were 84,230 transactions comprising this amount with an average dollar amount of $1,032. We reviewed 40 such transactions to determ ine if the expenses were allowable under 78 UW SYSTEM federal regulations. To complete our testing, we requested supporting documentation and information from UW-Madison fo r the transactions we reviewed. Questioned Costs: We questioned $650 in known questioned costs and an undetermined amount for other expenses we did not review. Because our testing was based upon a sample of payments it is likely there are additional cases where the payment is inappropriately charged to a federal award. We estimate thes e additional questioned costs are likely over $25,000, which is required to be reported under 2 CFR s. 200.516. Effect: UW-Madison used $650 in federal funds fro m the Research and Development Cluster for unallowable costs during FY 2021-22. Be cause unallowable costs were charged to the Research and Development Cluster, UW -Madison was not in compliance with federal requirements for the use of federal funding. Cause: UW-Madison staff indicated that the charges were applied to incorrect accounting codes when the expenses were originally recorded. For example, th e $54 for facilities and maintenance expenses was charged to a federal award in the accounting system due to a limitation of certain billing codes for applying such expenses to the correct location of the work. These errors were not id entified or corrected during the review of the payment or of other UW-Madison moni toring activities. In December 2022 and January 2023, UW-Madison corrected these accounting codes for these transactions and transferred the expenses to nonfederal projects. Recommendation We recommend the University of Wisconsin- Madison provide guidance and training to staff to ensure all costs are properly charge d to federal award accounting codes and only costs allowable under federal regulati ons are charged to federal funds.

The following is a summary of the work we performed at the departments of Children and Families, Military Affairs, Natural Resources, Revenue, Transportati on, Veterans Affairs, Office of the Commissioner of Insurance, the Wiscon sin Technical College System, and Board of Commissioners of Public Lands. Department of Children and Families The Wisconsin Department of Children an d Families (DCF) administers programs such as adoption assistance, foster care , and child support enforcement. It also administers the Wisconsin Shares child care subsidy program and Wisconsin's work-based public assistance program, Wisconsin Works (W-2). In FY 2021-22, DCF administered $781.8 million in federal financial assistance. We tested DCF's internal controls and comp liance with grant requirements for Every Student Succeeds Act/Preschool Developmen t Grants (Assistance Listing number 93.434), which is a type B grant program. Department of Military Affairs The Wisconsin Department of Military A ffairs (DMA) provides a military force through the Wisconsin National Guard, which is available for use in state and national emergencies. Through the Divi sion of Emergency Management, DMA also implements statewide emergency preparedness plans and administers federal disaster and Other Agencies 80 OTHER AGENCIES emergency relief funds. In FY 2021-22, DM A administered $98.3 million in federal financial assistance. We tested DMA's internal controls and co mpliance with grant requirements for two type A programs: National Guard Military Operations and Maintenance (O&M) Projects (Assistance Listing number 12.401 ) and Disaster Grants \u2014Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) (Assistance Listing number 97.036). Department of Natural Resources The Wisconsin Department of Natural Re sources (DNR) administers programs related to protecting and en hancing Wisconsin's natural resources, including its air, land, water, forests, wildlife, fish, and plants. In FY 2021-22, DNR administered $104.1 million in federal financial assistance. We tested DNR's internal controls and co mpliance with grant requirements for the Fish and Wildlife Cluster (Assistance Li sting numbers 15.605/15.611/15.626), which is a type A program. Department of Revenue The Department of Revenue (DOR) administ ers the State's major tax laws, including collecting individual income taxes, sales ta xes, and corporate income taxes; programs that provide financial assistance to local governments; the Wisconsin Lottery; and the Unclaimed Property program. In FY 2021-22, DOR administered $451.6 million in federal financial assistance. We tested DOR's inte rnal controls and compliance with grant requirements for Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (CSLFRF) (Assistance listing number 21.027), which is a type A program. DOA entered into memoranda of understanding with DOR to us e CSLFRF funding to administer various programs to assist local governments and busi nesses to address the effects of the public health emergency. Department of Transportation The Wisconsin Department of Transporta tion (DOT) administers transportation programs, including those affecting highways, bridges, airports, harbors, and railroads. In FY 2021-22, DOT administered $1.0 bi llion in federal financial assistance. We tested DOT's internal controls and comp liance with grant requirements for the Airport Improvement Program, COVID-19 Airports Programs, and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Programs (Assistance Listing number 20.106), which is a type A program. We also tested Formula Grants for Rural Areas and Tribal Transit Program (Assistance Listing number 20.509), which is a type B program. OTHER AGENCIES 81 Department of Veterans Affairs The Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affa irs (DVA) provides benefits, programs, and services for veterans living in Wisconsin. DVA also operat es three veterans homes that provide care for veterans. In FY 2021-22, DVA administered $54.5 million in federal financial assistance. We tested DVA's internal controls and co mpliance with grant requirements for Veterans State Nursing Home Care (Assist ance Listing number 64.015) program, which is a type A program. Office of the Commissioner of Insurance The Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI) supervises the insurance industry in Wisconsin. The office is re sponsible for examining insurance industry financial practices and market conduct, li censing insurance agents, reviewing policy forms for compliance with state insurance statutes and regulations, investigating consumer complaints, and providing consum er information. The office administers two segregated insurance funds: the State Life Insurance Fund and the Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund. In FY 2021-22, OCI administered $142.0 million in federal financial assistance. For our FY 2021-22 audit, no grants or subgrants administered by OCI were selected for au dit based on risk factors established by Uniform Guidance. However, we followed up on the progress of OCI in addressing Finding 2021-900 of the FY 2020-21 audit (report 22-5). OCI implemented corrective actions to address this finding. The Summary Schedule of Prior Audit Findings, which is prepared by management, begins on page 111 and describes the status of this finding as of the end of our audit period as well as ongo ing steps to address findings that were not fully corrected. Wisconsin Technical College System The Wisconsin Technical College System (WTCS) creates policy and provides direction for the 16 technical college districts in the State of Wisconsin, administers state and federal aids, coordinates vocational and tech nical programs with other state agencies, and coordinates adult education and family literacy services with technical college districts and community-based organization s. In FY 2021-22, WTCS administered $21.6 million in federal financial assistance. We tested WTCS's internal controls and compliance with grant requirements for Career and Technical Education\u2014Basic Grants to States (Assistance Listing number 84.048), which is a type B program. Board of Commissioners of Public Lands The Board of Commissioners of Public Land s (BCPL) administers various trust funds, including the Common School Fund, to support public schools and libraries. BCPL did not administer any federal financial assistance in FY 2021-22. However, as part of our audit of the State's financial statements we identified a significant deficiency in 82 OTHER AGENCIES internal control over financial reporting re lated to obtaining and reviewing a service organization audit report (Finding 2022-006 of report 22-26). This finding is included in Section II of the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs, which begins on page 83. 83 Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) requires the auditor to prepare a schedule of findings and questioned costs that includes the following three sections: 1) a summary of the auditor's results; 2) findings relating to the financial statements, which are required to be reported in accordance with Government Auditing Standards ; and 3) findings and questioned costs for federal awards.

These deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting are required to be reported by auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and Government Auditing Standards . We consider Finding 2022-001 to be an instance of noncompliance with federal requirements that is required to be report ed in accordance with Uniform Guidance. We also consider Finding 2022-001 and Find ing 2022-007 to be significant deficiencies in internal control over compliance. Find ings 2021-002, 2021-003, and 2021-004 from the prior year (report 21-23) are no lo nger reportable. Repeat findings from report 21 23 are indicated with an asterisk (*). Finding 2022-001: Medical Assistance Program Third-Party Liability Background: The U.S. Department of Health and Hu man Services provides funding to the Department of Health Services (DHS) fo r the Medical Assistance (MA) Program. Funding under the MA Program is used to assist states in maintaining and expanding health care services to certain categories of low-income persons. Services provided to participants include both inpatient and outp atient services that providers bill on a feefor-service basis. Providers submit claims fo r services for eligible participants in the MA Program through the Medicaid Managem ent Information System (MMIS), which is administered by the MA Program's fiscal agent. DHS works with the fiscal agent to ensure that the MMIS system is correctly pr ocessing claims, changes to the system are approved, and an audit of system controls related to claims is completed annually. Criteria: Under 42 CFR ss. 433.135 through 433.154, DHS is required to make reasonable efforts to determine the legal liability of third-part y insurers for MA Program participants and have processes in place to identify and asse ss claims to determine if a third-party may be responsible for payment. For example, ce rtain MA Program participants are also eligible for Medicare. If the services pr ovided to a participant could be paid by Medicare, or any other third-party insurer, the claims should first be submitted to the third-party insurer by the provider before the claims are submitted to the MA Program. To assess the validity of a claim prior to pa ying a provider the approved fee-for-service rate, DHS has established validity checks within MMIS called edits. These edits include cost avoidance rules, which are a se ries of rules within MMIS that identify claims meeting specific criteria related to whether a third-party insurer, including Medicare, could be responsible for payment of the services provided. These rules use claim information, including participant info rmation and type of service, to determine if a third-party insurer may be responsible fo r payment. If the claim meets the criteria identified in these rules, the provider cl aim is denied. For claims that are denied through the cost avoidance rules, the MA Program may subsequently pay some claims if the third-party insurer ultimately does not cover the services provided to the participant. 86 SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS Condition: We found one MA Program payment of $1,956 for outpatient services that was not properly identified and denied under the cost avoidance rules in MMIS. Based upon the outpatient services of this claim, th e payment should have been denied because the participant was enrolled in Medicare at the time the service was provided, and Medicare may have been responsibl e for payment of the service. Context: During FY 2021-22, based upon MA Program payment information provided by DHS, a total of $5.2 billion was paid to providers fo r fee-for-service claims. During FY 2021-22, there were $324.5 million in MA Program pa yments for 586,522 claims for outpatient services. Of the 40 fee-for-se rvice claims we reviewed, seven claims were for outpatient services that had payments totaling $6,445. Questioned Costs: For the $1,956 payment we identified, we question $1,293 as the estimated federal share. We also question an undetermined amount for other claims DHS paid using MA Program funding during FY 2021-22 for participants also enrolled in Medicare. Effect: DHS inappropriately used MA Program fundin g to make a payment for an outpatient claim that may be covered by Medicare, resu lting in an improper payment under the MA Program. Further, because the cost avoida nce rules are applied to all claims, it is likely there are additional claims for servic es provided to participants who are also enrolled in Medicare that were improperly paid. Cause: The improper payment we identified occurre d because the cost avoidance rules were not correctly established to deny this type of claim for a participant who was also enrolled in Medicare. According to DHS sta ff, in 2015 DHS reviewed cost avoidance rules in MMIS related to Medicare in an effo rt to simplify and clarify the rules. In making and testing changes to these rules, DHS did not identify errors in claims meeting criteria similar to the one selected for testing as a part of our audit. DHS indicated that no further testing specific to these rules was performed after these cost avoidance rules were tested and implemented in 2015. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Depa rtment of Health Services: review and update the Medicaid Management Information System cost avoidance rules to properly identify and deny payment for claims that may be covered by third-party insurers; identify payments made during FY 2021-22 that may have been improper due to inaccurate cost av oidance rules and seek to recover these amounts; return to the federal government recovered payments that may have been improper; and SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 87 perform an assessment and implem ent additional procedures to review changes to cost avoi dance rules in the future. Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency, Noncompliance Response from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services: The Wisconsin Department of Health Services agrees wi th the audit finding and recommendations. Finding 2022-002: Department of Administration/Division of Enterprise Technology Information Security Access Review Process Background: Under s. 16.971 (2), Wis. Stats., the Departme nt of Administration (DOA) is responsible for the State's information technology (IT) services, including ensuring that all state data processing facilities develop proper privacy and security procedures and safeguards. As a part of DOA, the Division of Enterprise Technology (DET) operates data centers to provide a variety of services to state agencies, including managing the mainframe for all agencies; managing serv ers for DOA and other executive branch agencies; and maintaining DOA-related systems. In addition, DET performs programming and security functions, including maintaining the infrastructure for STAR, which is the State's enterprise re source planning system that includes accounting, payroll, and purchasing sy stems used by most state agencies. We have reported access review concerns related to DET accounts since our FY 2015-16 audit and have made recommendations to DET to review and update access and retain documentation of such reviews. Although DET established a policy and standard regarding access reviews, it did not complete access reviews in accordance with the policy and standards for all hardware and software maintained by DET. Criteria: The Wisconsin Access Control Standard states that the privileges assigned to roles or classes of users must be reviewed annually to validate the need for such privileges. Further, the Standard states that access to privileged accounts must be reviewed at least every six months to determine whether the account is still required and access remains appropriate. An effective access review process co ntains the following key elements: identification of all active us er accounts, both standard and privileged, that should be reviewed; a timeline to review identified user accounts within appropriate time frames; approval of each user account's access by entity staff at an appropriate level within the entity that understands the user's access requirements; and a process to validate that access changes resulting from the review were completed. 88 SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS In addition, it is important that access re view documentation is maintained and that responsibilities for the access review pr ocess are communicated to the appropriate entity staff. Condition: During FY 2021-22, DET did not complete access reviews in accordance with the policy and standards for all DOA and DOA-managed user accounts. In addition, DET has not completed access reviews in some areas sinc e we first made a recommendation as part of our FY 2015-16 audit. Context: We reviewed the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards and made inquiries of senior management to gain an understanding of the process for reviewing access and to assess progress DE T made in addressing our FY 2021-22 recommendations. As noted, the areas of insufficient access reviews are pervasive across several different types of accounts. Further, these accoun ts have access to various hardware and software located in the DET data centers, which could affect all executive branch agencies. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: Access reviews are important to ensure a ccess remains appropriate based on user responsibilities and the principle of leas t privilege. Because DET hosts and supports a significant number of executive branch agency systems at its data centers, users with inappropriate access have the ability to affe ct the computing resources and data of all state agencies with resources connected to the DET network. Cause: DET indicated that steps were taken in FY 202 1-22 to attempt to complete user access reviews. However, DET indicated it was un able to develop clear and reproducible access reports that could be used for a regu lar access review process. DET indicated that in August 2022, it purchased an access management tool to automate the user access reviews and is developing plans to implement the tool in FY 2022-23. Although automating the access review process coul d be beneficial, this access management tool cannot be applied to all access types a pplicable to the DET network environment. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Administration, Division of Enterprise Technology develop and complete a proc ess by June 30, 2023, to perform access reviews in accordance with the State of Wisc onsin IT Security Policy Handbook, including updating access based on the review and reta ining documentation of the review and the updates made to access. Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 89 Response from Wisconsin Department of Administration, Division of Enterprise Technology: The Wisconsin Department of Administra tion agrees with the audit finding and recommendation. Finding 2022-003: Department of Administration/Division of Enterprise Technology Information Security Policy Exception Process Background: Under s. 16.971(2), Wis. Stats., DOA is respon sible for the State's IT services, including ensuring that all state data processing faci lities develop proper privacy and security procedures and safeguards. Further, statut es require DOA to provide oversight and monitoring of state agency IT operations. As a part of DOA, DET operates data centers to provide a variety of services to state agencies, including managing the mainframe for all agencies; managing servers for DOA and other executive branch agencies; and maintaining DOA-related systems. DOA implemented the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook , which includes policies for IT security and the related standards. Executive branch agencies are expected to comply with these policies and standards, or obtain an approved exception to a policy or standard if compliance cannot be achieved. An exception is a known deviation from policies in the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards. For example, DOA may appr ove an exception to allow an agency to deviate from an established IT security policy, such as a password policy. We reported concerns with the process fo r requesting an exception during our FY 2018-19 audit and made recommendations to DET to improve its process. During our FY 2020-21 audit, we again made recommen dations to DET to improve its exception process. However, DET did not make sufficient progress in addressing our recommendations in this area. Criteria: The compliance section of the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards states that if compliance with part icular policies or related standards is not feasible or technically possible, or if a deviation from a policy or standard is justifiable to support a business function, executive branch agencies can request an exception through the exception procedures established by the DOA/DET Bureau of Security. Further, the Security Policy an d Standards Review and Maintenance section of the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards states that the DOA/DET Bureau of Security is resp onsible for coordinati ng the review and tracking of exception requests to the IT security policies and standards. An effective exception process cont ains the following key elements: identification of situations where established processes or configurations do not comply with established policies; a process to report exceptions to th ese policies by entity staff at an appropriate level within the entity; 90 SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS an assessment of the exception requ ested that considers risks to the entity of authorizing the exception and potential compensating controls that could be implemented; approval of exceptions at an approp riate level within the entity that understands the policies and risks; and regular review of approved exceptions, such as annually, to ensure risks remain acceptable and to consider if changes can be made to alleviate the need for an exception. In addition, it is important that document ation of exception requests and approvals be maintained and that the responsibilities for the exception process are appropriately communicated. Condition: In response to recommendations from our FY 2020-21 audit, DET indicated it would review its new dashboard that identifies exceptions to the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook , as self-reported by executive branch agencies. DET also indicated it would work with executive br anch agencies to ensure any exceptions identified in this review were drafted an d approved by September 30, 2022. However, as of June 30, 2022, DET completed a prelimin ary analysis of the dashboard, identified instances of noncompliance, an d indicated that meetings were held to assist agencies in becoming compliant with the policies. However, DET did not provide sufficient documentation to support that these meet ings were held, the discussions that occurred, and the steps that agencies were taking to become compliant. Further, there were no new exceptions drafted, even though agencies were not following all policies, standards, and procedures in the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook . We followed up with DET in October 2022, and fo und that executive branch agencies were asked to draft exceptions and provide them to DET by November 30, 2022. In response to recommendations from our FY 2020-21 audit, DET had indicated that by March 30, 2022, it would perform an asse ssment of current exceptions, identify the risks related to approving the exceptions , and consider pote ntial compensating controls. In completing testing during ou r FY 2021-22 audit, we found DET remediated 2 of 13 policy exceptions we identified du ring our FY 2020-21 audit and prepared draft exceptions for 3 others. DET also had indicated that it would review approved exceptions on a quarterly basis to assess if the approval of the exceptio n should continue. Although DET provided a spreadsheet that indicated that it was tr acking some exceptions, the documentation did not include evidence that DET cons istently communicated with the agency regarding the continued need for the exception or an assessment of the risks related to the exception. For example, in December 2021 DET requested an agency provide additional information regarding an except ion. However, DET did not provide a due date for its request. As of October 2022, there was no response from the agency, or documentation that DET had followed up with the agency on its request. Finally, DET indicated it would review it s exceptions procedure and forms, make revisions to ensure exceptions are properly submitted and approved, and communicate relevant procedures and respon sibilities to DET and executive branch SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 91 agencies by March 30, 2022. DET did not co mplete a review or make updates to its exceptions procedure and forms by March 30, 2022, or before the end of FY 2021-22. Context: We reviewed the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards, made inquiries of DET staff, reviewed appr oved exceptions, and evaluated the design of the existing exception process. We evaluated the new dashboard for agency compliance with the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards. We compared the dashboard results against the spreadsheet of approved and in progress exceptions. We identified concerns with the exception process across ni ne policy areas in the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards. Most state agencies use computer systems that are located on the mainframe or on servers maintained in the DET data centers. Therefore, IT weaknesses at one agency can affect IT security for other agencies. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: Without a strong information security policy exception process in place, DET does not have an appropriate awareness of areas wher e policies are not being followed. As a result, weaknesses in the overall security in the state network may not be identified or corrected. In our review of compliance with nine poli cies and standards in the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards, as reported in the Policy Standards and Procedures dashboard by four executiv e branch agencies, we identified 34 areas of noncompliance or partial noncompliance with the policies an d standards for which there was not an approved exception. Cause: DET did not have adequate procedures in place for administering the exceptions process and did not develop an efficient tr aining process to address agency staff turnover. Documentation provided by DET indicated that DET did not communicate regularly with executive branch agencies r egarding the status of exceptions, establish timelines for agency responses to DET's inqu iries, or escalate to senior management when an agency was not responding to DET' s inquiries. In addition, DET did not have procedures for escalating ex ecutive branch agency noncom pliance with the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards, to senior management within the particular agency and within DOA. DET staff indicated that other priorities, including resolving questions and issues arising from other third-party audits of DET, were assessed as higher priority than addressing the recommendations in this area. 92 SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Administration, Division of Enterprise Technology: complete by January 31, 2023, a review of its existing IT security exception process and make revisi ons to the process, including developing a procedure for escalating noncompliance with established policies to senior mana gement within the Department of Administration and within the part icular executive branch agency; develop an exception process trai ning program and communicate the relevant training program and ex ception process procedures and responsibilities to its staff and executive branch agency staff by January 31, 2023; and complete and document its review and assessment of processes and configurations that do not co mply with established policies, complete approvals of exceptio ns when changes to processes cannot be made timely, maintain documentation of discussions and meetings with agency staff as the review and assessment of exceptions are completed, and comple te this review and approval of exceptions by March 31, 2023. Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency Response from the Wisconsin Department of Administration, Division of Enterprise Technology: The Wisconsin Department of Administra tion agrees with the audit finding and recommendations. Finding 2022-004: Department of Administration Information Technology Oversight and Monitoring Responsibilities* Background: DOA is responsible for the State's IT se rvices, including providing oversight and monitoring of executive branch agency IT operations. We first recommended that DOA develop and implement executive branch agency IT policies and standards and provide oversight and monitoring of execut ive branch agencies' IT operations seven years ago during our FY 2014-15 audit. During subsequent audits, we recommended that DOA take steps to identify, assess, and address risks for the State's IT environment. These steps were to include completion of a comprehensive risk management program across all executive branch agenci es. DOA has taken steps including: implementing in FY 2018-19 the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook , which includes policies for IT security and the related standards with which executive branch agencies are expected to comply; SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 93 developing in FY 2019-20 a risk assessment plan, which contained a plan for improving vulnerability management and completing penetration testing; initiating efforts in FY 2020-21 to develop a baseline understanding of agency compliance, with the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards; and implementing and configuring in FY 2021-22 a new vulnerability management tool. During our FY 2020-21 audit (report 21-23), we found that DOA did not collect needed information from all executive branch agenci es, and DOA did not establish a plan for other important monitoring steps, such as an alyzing the effectiveness of the procedures established by executive branch agencies. At that time, we recommended that DOA improve its monitoring program, perform ongoing vulnerability assessments, and update its risk assessment program. Criteria: Wisconsin Statutes give DOA responsibility for the State's IT services. Under s.16.971 (2), Wis. Stats., DOA is required to work wi th executive branch agencies to establish IT policies, procedures, and planning proce sses. In addition, statutes require DOA to monitor adherence to these policies, proced ures, and processes. Further, statutes require DOA to provide oversight and moni toring of executive branch agency IT operations, which includes ensuring: management reviews of IT organizations are conducted; all executive branch agencies develop and operate with clear guidelines and standards in the areas of IT systems development and employ good management practices and cost-benefit justifications; and all state data-processing facilities develop proper privacy and security procedures and safeguards. Finally, s. 16.973 (3), Wis. Stats., states th at DOA shall facilitate the implementation of statewide initiatives, including the de velopment and maintenance of policies and programs to protect the privacy of indivi duals who are the subjects of information contained in the agency databases. National Institute of Standard s and Technology (NIST) 800-137 Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federa l Information Systems and Organizations indicates that ongoing monitoring is a critical part of an organization's risk management process. In addition, an organization's overa ll IT security architecture and accompanying security program should be monitored to en sure that organization-wide operations remain within an acceptable level of risk despite any changes that occur. Key steps in effective monitoring include: developing and communicating the policies, procedures, and standards that form the security framework; collecting information on the effect iveness of the policies, standards, and procedures; 94 SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS analyzing the information collected; responding to the results of the analyses; and reviewing and updating the monitoring program. Condition: During our FY 2021-22 audit, we found again that DOA did not have sufficient oversight and monitoring in place to ensure executive branch agency adherence to the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards. DOA completed and published a baseline dashboard of agency compliance with the IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards, based on in formation self-reported by executive branch agencies. DOA completed a preliminar y analysis of the dashboard, identified instances of noncompliance, an d indicated that meetings were held to assist agencies in becoming compliant with the policies. However, DOA did not provide sufficient documentation to support that these meet ings were held, the discussions that occurred, and the steps that agencies were taking to become compliant. We include recommendations in Finding 2022-003 for DO A to improve its information security policy exception process that wi ll help address these concerns. Given its statutory responsibilities, it would be expected that DOA would review agency procedures to assess the accuracy of the self-reported information, and the effectiveness of the procedures established by the executive branch agencies. However, DOA did not take sufficient steps to asse ss the accuracy of the agency-reported information. DOA indicated that it performe d some reviews of agency procedures to assess compliance with the IT policies. However, DOA did not provide documentation to support that these reviews were complete d, and DOA indicated it had no plans to conduct additional reviews. In our review of agency compliance with the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards, we found that certain controls reported by four agencies in the dashboard as being compliant were not compliant based on our audit work. For example, two agencies assessed their personnel termination status as implemente d. However, the agencies' timelines to disable access exceeded the timeline listed in the standard. Another agency assessed its business continuity plan test as implem ented. However, upon discussion with the agency, the planned test was canceled due to lack of staff availability. During FY 2021-22, DOA worked with execut ive branch agencies to implement a new vulnerability management tool. As of June 30, 2022, 14 of 19 agencies had implemented the new tool. However, a licensure issue re sulted in changes to how DOA planned to use the vulnerability tool, at least in the sh ort term. As a result, DOA did not establish plans for how ongoing vulnerability asse ssments would be performed, or how DOA would respond to those assessments and make changes to the State's IT environment. Finally, due to the implementation issues with the new vulnerability tool, DOA did not make further progress in the development of its risk assessment plan. In addition, DOA did not update its risk assessment plan to in clude consideration of the risks related to known deviations from policies in the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards. For example, DOA may approve an exception to allow an agency to deviate from an established IT se curity policy, such as a password policy. Although deviations from the policies have been approved, the deviations may bring additional risk that DOA should consider in its oversight and monitoring of the State's IT environment. In Finding 2022-003, we make recommendations for DOA to improve the information security policy exception process. SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 95 Context: State agencies rely on computer systems to complete critical functions, including processing checks, accounting for cash receipts, preparing financial statements, and administering federal grant programs. DOA is responsible for ensuring these computer systems are properly secured. We interviewe d key DOA staff to gain an understanding of the steps that were taken by June 30, 20 22, to provide oversight and monitoring of executive branch agency IT operations and adherence to the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards. We also interviewed key DOA staff to gain an understanding of DOA's plans for utilizing the new enterprise vulnerability management tool to identify vulnerabilities with security patch, configuration, and regulatory compliance issues. We evalua ted the baseline dashboard of executive branch agency compliance with the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards. We compared the dashboard results against our review of agency compliance with certain IT policies and standards for four executive branch agencies. Because DOA has responsibility to provide ov ersight and monitoring over IT operations for executive branch agencies, and because there are connections among agencies in the State's network, IT weaknesses at one agency can affect IT security for other agencies. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: For FY 2021-22, DOA did not comply with s.16.971 (2), Wis. Stats., which requires DOA to provide oversight and monitoring of ex ecutive branch agency IT operations and adherence to the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards. Insufficient monitoring of agency IT enviro nments can lead to vulnerabilities in the State's network, known or unknown, because there is no assurance that all systems are meeting the minimum level of security for the State's IT environment, as established in the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards. Weaknesses in the security of the network can lead to inappropriate access to confidential or sensitive data, unauthorized changes to the da ta within the system, or a failure of the system. Cause: DOA indicated that executive branch agencies were not always responsive to requests to discuss noncompliance with the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related standards, and the steps needed to address the noncompliance. However, DOA did not have procedures to assist its staff in understanding when and how to escalate to senior management within the particular a gency and within DOA when agencies were not responsive. DOA did not establish a monitoring proc ess to analyze the accuracy of the agencyreported information or to assess the effectiveness of executive branch agency controls. DOA should develop a plan for the review of agency procedures. This plan could include different levels of revi ew based on an assessment of risk to the State's IT environment and could be cycled to smooth the effort over a period of time. 96 SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS Finally, DOA indicated that it encountered licensure issues in implementing the new vulnerability management tool, which delaye d its comprehensive use of the tool for ongoing monitoring and precluded additional updates to its risk assessment program. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Administration, Division of Enterprise Technology comply with its statutory responsi bilities to provide oversight and monitoring of executive branch agency adhere nce to the State's IT policies by: using its statutory authority to en sure executive branch agencies conform with the State's IT polic ies and standards or obtain an approved exception by March 31, 2023; developing and communicating to executive branch agencies by March 31, 2023, a monitoring plan to review the effectiveness of agency-reported information in th e dashboard, including how the Department of Administration will report results to the agency and expected timelines for agencies to correct the noncompliance with the State's IT policies and standards or obtain an approved exception; establishing detailed plans by June 30, 2023, for how it will perform ongoing vulnerability assessments with the new vulnerability management tool, respond to those assessments, and make changes to further strengthen th e State's IT environment; and continuing to update its risk management program including considering the risks related to approved policy exceptions and remediating known vulnerabilities. Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency Response from the Wisconsin Department of Administration, Division of Enterprise Technology: The Wisconsin Department of Admini stration agrees with the audit finding and recommendations. Finding 2022-005: Financial Reportin g for the Medical Assistance Program Background: The financial activity of programs admi nistered by DHS, which includes the MA Program, is reported as part of the State's General Fund in the State's Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR). The MA Program provides health care services to certain categories of low-income persons. The MA Program is significant to the General Fund and, as a result, consider ation of the activity of this program and changes in the program are critical to accurate financial reporting. In FY 2021-22, DHS claimed a dditional federal funds for the MA Program, as allowed by Section 9817 of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. The claim amount was calculated based upon an increase in the federal medical assistance percentage SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 97 (FMAP) rate by 10 percent fo r certain home and community-based services provided to participants during the period April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2022. To claim the increased FMAP rate, DHS made several adjustments primarily related to the allowable portion of monthly capitation pa yments. These adjustments resulted in the receipt of federal funds totaling $329.2 million during FY 2021-22. Further, an additional $75.5 million was received in FY 2022-23 that related primarily to certain services provided to participants on a f ee-for-service basis during the period from April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2022. Federal regulations require the funds derive d from the increased FMAP to be reinvested in the MA Program to implement or suppl ement home and community-based services to participants. DHS is required to return to the federal government any remaining amount that is unexpended as of Marc h 31, 2025. During FY 2021-22, DHS had reinvested $50.6 million of these funds. Criteria: For use in preparing the financial statements of the State's General Fund as reported in the ACFR, DHS is responsible for prep aring adjustments in accordance with Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) standards and submitting this information to the Department of Admini stration State Controller's Office (DOA SCO). The Uniform GAAP Conversion Policies and Procedures Manual , which is published by DOA-SCO, provides guidance to state agen cies in preparing adjustments. Using the requirements of the accounting standards promulgated by GASB, Section V-18 of the manual includes requirements related to the appropriate reporting of amounts received related to a federal grant program. Condition: DHS did not consider whether the addition al funds derived from the increased FMAP required an adjustment to properly report the activity in the General Fund financial statements. At our request, DHS reviewed th e process used to claim and receive these funds as well as the federal requirements re lated to the use of these funds. From this analysis, DHS concluded that the $75.5 million in federal funds it received in FY 2022-23 should have been accrued both as a receivab le and as a federal revenue for FY 2021-22. In addition, because the federal government required the funds to be reinvested in certain MA Program services, the unspent bala nce of $278.6 million as of June 30, 2022, as well as the $75.5 million received in FY 2022-23, should have been reported as a restriction of the General Fund's fund balance in the financial statements. Context: We interviewed DHS staff to gain an understanding of the federal requirements related to the receipt of the funds derived from the increased FMAP and reviewed the federal regulations related to the future use of these amounts. We also reviewed claim adjustments processed throughout FY 2021-22 and adjustments subsequent to the end of FY 2021-22 to verify activity related to the funds. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: The Intergovernmental Revenue account on the Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Fund Balance and Due from Other Government account on the 98 SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS Balance Sheet were understated by $75.5 mi llion for the General Fund. In addition, Fund Balance\u2014Restricted was understate d by $354.1 million and Fund Balance\u2014 Unrestricted was overstated by $354. 1 in the General Fund Balance Sheet. Cause: DHS staff responsible for financial reporting discussed MA Program activity with staff responsible for accounting and monitoring the MA Prog ram to identify potential adjustments that may have been needed to the FY 2021-22 General Fund financial statements. These discussions were not sufficien t to identify the need for an adjustment related to the receipt and future use of the funds derived from the increased FMAP. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Depa rtment of Health Services: develop and implement additional procedures to evaluate the potential effects of changes in the programs that it administers; and use the additional procedures to evaluate changes that may require further consideration and adjust ments for financial reporting purposes. Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency Response from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services: The Wisconsin Department of Health Services agrees wi th the audit finding and recommendations. Finding 2022-006: Common School Fund\u2014Service Organization Internal Controls Background: The Board of Commissioners of Public Lands (BCPL) administers the Common School Fund, which accounts for proceeds from the sale of land granted by the federal government to Wisconsin when it became a state. The state Constitution established that the proceeds from the sale of the public lands be invested and held in perpetuity in the Fund, and the investment income be distribu ted as library aids to school districts. 2015 Wisconsin Act 60 expanded BCPL's inve stment authority, which allowed it to consider a broader array of investments fo r the Common School Fund assets. Prior to this time, the Common Scho ol Fund assets were limited to investments in certain municipal bonds and notes. Since that time, BCPL has expanded its investments to include equities and limited partnerships. Criteria: Management is responsible for the proper design, implementation, and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the prepar ation and fair presentation of financial information that is free from material misst atement. This includes instances in which management contracts with a service organi zation, which is an organization that provides services to another entity and th ose services are relevant to the entity's SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 99 internal controls over financial reporting. For example, an entity may use a service organization to process financ ial transactions or an entity may outsource some of its accounting functions to a service organization. When using a service organization, the entity should gain assurances that the internal controls at the service organization are operating effectively because weaknesses in the service organization's internal controls could affect the financial activity of the entity. Such assurances could be gained th rough a service organization audit, which includes a report on the service organizati on's internal controls by an independent auditor. One type of audit that may be completed includes an opinion on the fairness of management's description of the internal controls in place at the service organization, whether the auditor believes the service organization's internal controls are suitably designed to achieve the internal control objective, and whether the service organization's internal controls are effe ctive at achieving the internal control objective. If an entity relying on a service organizati on does not obtain a service organization audit report, the entity should ensure it has assessed the work being completed by the service organization, and has implemented procedures to ensure the accuracy of processing completed by the service organiza tion and of the information provided by the service organization. Condition: BCPL maintains a service agreement with a custodian bank, which is responsible for conducting purchases and sales of investme nts as authorized by BCPL. The custodian bank makes wire transfers for capital calls fo r limited partnership investments, collects income, and keeps cash and investment ho ldings for the Common School Fund. BCPL also relies on accounting and investment reports prepared by the custodian bank, including reporting the fair value of invest ments to BCPL, which are used for financial reporting. The custodian bank performs certain services for BCPL that classify it as a service organization. Although BCPL relies on the custodian bank, it did not document its assessment of its reliance on the custodian bank, it did not obtain a service organization audit report from its custodian bank, nor did it perform ot her procedures sufficient to reduce risk. For example, BCPL could request its custodia n bank to provide a SOC 1, Type 2 service organization audit report, which would prov ide an independent auditor's opinion on the design and effectiveness of the cust odian bank's internal controls that are important to BCPL's financial reporting. BC PL could also assess the reliance placed on its custodian bank and reduce its risks by performing other procedures, such as reviewing the investment valuation provided by its custodian bank to provide assurance of its accuracy. Context: We reviewed BCPL's investment records for the Common School Fund and discussed its investment procedures, including the se rvices provided by its custodian bank. When we inquired about the internal cont rols related to the custodian bank, we learned that BCPL did not obtain a service organization audit report from its custodian bank. The Common School Fund investment assets have increased from $496.4 million as of June 30, 2015, to $981.1 million as of June 30, 2022, an increase of $484.7 million, or 97.6 percent. 100 SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS Questioned Costs: None. Effect: The custodian bank may have internal co ntrol deficiencies about which BCPL is unaware that could affect the investment s or financial reporting for the Common School Fund. Cause: BCPL staff indicated that the custodian ba nk would provide a service organization audit report. However, BCPL staff did not kn ow which specific internal controls at the custodian bank were important and, therefore, needed to be tested by a service organization auditor. Because a service organization audit report provides an opinion on whether internal controls of the service organization are op erating effectively, BCPL could obtain a service organization audit report as an addi tional tool to assess whether its custodian bank has effective internal controls in pl ace and to assess whether any identified deficiencies should be further discusse d and addressed with respect to BCPL transactions and holdings. In addition, BCPL could use the service organization audit report to assess whether appropriate and su fficient internal controls are in place at BCPL to complement the internal controls at the custodian bank. Recommendation We recommend the Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands: complete and document an asse ssment of its reliance on its custodian bank; and determine and implement internal co ntrols as appropriate to ensure the accuracy of information it rece ives from the custodian bank; or obtain a service organization audi t report from its custodian bank, assess and document its review of the effectiveness of the custodian bank's internal controls as reported in the service organization audit report, and assess and document its review of the service organization audit report to ensure appropriate and sufficient internal controls are present at the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands to complement the internal co ntrols at the custodian bank. Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency Response from the Board of Co mmissioners of Public Lands: The Wisconsin Board of Commissioners of Public Lands agrees with the audit finding and recommendations. SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 101 Finding 2022-007: UW System Info rmation Technology Internal Control Deficiencies Background: In April 2021, the University of Wiscon sin (UW) System implemented ShopUW+ (SUW) as a new procure-to-pay procuremen t system that integrates approval of purchases among all 13 UW institutions. Simi lar to other systemwide applications, UW System Administration was responsi ble for administering SUW, including developing systemwide polices and ensuri ng adequate internal controls. SUW is a cloud-based system, and some SUW activiti es are integrated with UW System's accounting system, the Shared Financial Syst em (SFS). For example, SUW system roles responsible for providing approvals on UW purchases are authorized by designated individuals at each UW institution. Cert ain other roles are provisioned through a formal process within SFS. The proce ss to provide SUW approval access, and subsequently monitor this access, was different than with SFS. Criteria: Under s. 36.09 (1), Wis. Stats., the Board of Regents is vested with the primary responsibility for the governance of UW Sy stem. In discharging this responsibility, compliance with local, state, and federal regu lations is necessary to protect institutional and research data. UW System Administrative Procedure 1031.B Information Security: Data Protections requires that information technolo gy systems follow operating system- specific best practices for system managemen t and security. Such best practices include limiting access to those individuals who need access to complete properly separated job duties and periodically reviewing th e access provided to ensure it remains appropriate. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and NIST 800-53 Release 5 , when an entity uses a cloud-based third-party to process financial transactions or it outsou rces some of its information technology functions, the entity should consider whet her assurances are needed to ensure the third-party internal controls are operating e ffectively. Weaknesses in the third-party's internal controls could affect the financial ac tivity of the entity. These assurances are typically provided through a service organizati on audit report, which is a report on the service organization's internal cont rols by an independent auditor. A service organization audit report is inte nded to meet the needs of management of user entities, such as UW System Administra tion, and user entities' auditors. One type of audit that may be completed includes an opinion on the fairness of management's description of the internal controls in pl ace at a service organization, whether the auditor believes those controls are suitably designed to achieve the internal control objective, and whether the internal contro ls are effective at achieving the control objective. Condition: We identified two concerns with the internal controls over SUW. First, we found that UW System Administration had not formally documented that UW institutions should periodically review approval access authoriz ed within the SUW application. We also note that these approval roles within SUW we re not included in the SFS access review process conducted by UW institutions. UW System Administration provides weekly reports of employee job changes to assist UW institutions in monitoring SUW approval access. Although UW System Administration staff indicated that certain UW institution 102 SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS staff were responsible for conducting a review of this report to monitor SUW-authorized access, there was no established procedure nor any systemwide monitoring to ensure that each UW institution completed such a review. We contacted four UW institutions and only one UW institution identified the weekly job change report provided by UW System Administration as part of their process to review SUW approval access. Second, UW System Administration did not ob tain a service organization audit report from its third-party SUW vendor during FY 2021-22 to provide assurances that the vendor had appropriate internal controls in place and that they were operating effectively. Because UW System Administra tion did not obtain the annual service organization audit report, it also did not consider the adequacy of certain activities that UW System should have in place to en sure reliance on the third-party vendor's internal controls, such as reviewing SU W access authorized by UW institutions. Context: We reviewed the SFS and SUW systems, whic h include internal controls over certain UW institution expenses reported in the FY 2021-22 financial statements and certain federal grant programs. During FY 2021- 22, UW System approved $1.3 billion in payments through access authorized within SUW. We also assessed established UW systemwide policies requiring adequate intern al controls and procedures to ensure that each UW institution complied with these policies. In addition, we reviewed a UW System Office of Internal Audit report on certain SUW internal controls that was completed in March 2022. We further discu ssed the SFS and SUW access review process with UW System Administration and certain UW institutions. We performed transaction testing to review a sample of payments, including those approved through SUW, to ensure the transactions were appropriatel y approved. We discussed management of service organization audit reports with UW System Administration staff. Questioned Costs: None. Effect: Access reviews are important to ensure a ccess remains appropriate based on user responsibilities and the principle of least privilege. Failure to monitor access can lead to inappropriate access to sensitive data or inappropriate transaction approvals. Although it can be difficult to determine ho w information security concerns affect the financial statements and material compliance areas, ineffective information security controls may permit controls over individu al systems to operate improperly and may allow financial statement misstatements and noncompliance to occur and not be detected. Cause: UW System Administration had emphasized with UW institutions that each UW institution was responsible for granting appr opriate access for SUW approvers. However, UW System Administration had not communi cated in writing the responsibility of UW institutions to conduct pe riodic access reviews for SU W approval roles nor did UW System Administration include SUW approval roles in the SFS access review process due to the large number of approvers. UW System Administration is currently working on the Administrative Transformation Program (ATP ), which will replace certain systemwide information technology applicat ions, and it currently plans to retain SUW when the ATP project is completed. Therefore, UW System Administration should take further steps to clarify and monitor UW institution review requirements for SUW approval access. SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS 103 UW System Administration performed a risk assessment in 2019 prior to contracting with the cloud-based third-party vendor to assess the vendor's internal controls, including security provisions. In addition, UW System's contract with the cloud-based third-party vendor provides for a service or ganization audit report. However, no UW System Administration staff were assigned th e responsibilty or requirement to annually obtain and review such a report. As the a pplication owner, UW System Administration should obtain and review a service organizati on audit report at least annually. Because UW System's current ATP project is planning to rely on additional cloud-based third- party vendors to administer aspects of th ese new systemwide applications, it is important for UW System Administration to establish systemwide policies to adequately monitor cloud-based third-party vendor internal controls. Recommendation We recommend the University of Wisconsin Sy stem Administration improve its oversight of the ShopUW+ application by: developing a written requiremen t for University of Wisconsin institutions to periodically re view ShopUW+ approval access and communicating this requirement to all University of Wisconsin institutions; developing a procedure to monitor th e compliance of all University of Wisconsin institutions with the re quirement for periodic review of ShopUW+ approval access; developing a policy to require peri odic review of the adequacy of certain cloud-based third-party vendor s' internal controls, such as by assigning the responsibility to obta in a service organization audit report and ensuring such reports are reviewed; and annually obtaining and reviewing re levant service organization audit reports. Type of Finding: Significant Deficiency Response from the University of Wisconsin System Administration: The University of Wisconsin System Administration agrees wi th the audit finding and recommendations. 104 SCHEDULE OF FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS Section III Federal Award Findings and Questioned Costs Uniform Guidance requires that audit findin gs be presented in sufficient detail for the auditee to prepare a corrective action plan and take corrective action, and for federal agencies and pass-through en tities to make a management decision.

93.778) Status of Audit Finding: Partially Corrected DHS implemented changes to its weekly report to accurately identify all instances in which payments were made to providers who were subsequently identified to be ineligible, including identifying all claims where providers were terminated between the beginning and ending date of a service range. DHS has not recouped improper Medical Assistance Program payments it made to five ineligible providers during FY 2020-21 for services provided after their effective termination dates. DHS Office of Legal Counsel determined that before DMS can actively recover from terminated providers, the Department needs to update its recovery process. DHS needs to ensure the Department is in compliance in cases of changes in ownership, which is the most common example of terminated providers being reimbursed. Recoupment from these providers will be attempted once this project is implemented. The project is scheduled to be implemented pri or to September 30, 2022.

Between the issuance of 2021-305 and the end of June, we met with our IT coordinator and management team to think through the best way to integrate processes, policies, and approvals. Planning for a work tracking system had already been underway since January of 2022. Since June, we have rolled out the work tracking system for testing to our managers before we roll out to all Bureau staff. We have and will continue to refine this system. We have scheduled a Bureau wide meeting to roll out the work tracking system to all staff on February 28, 2023. In addition, we have engaged our IT Bureau to implement an additional layer of approval in the PRISM system that the Bureau of Rate Setting uses to approve payments to capture the record of section manager approval.

A summary of the modifications is provided below. Random Samples An Excel template programed with the Excel RANDARRAY1 function determines enrollees to be sampled. This same template will be used to determine which claims require proof of payment as part of the phase II audit. Number of Enrollees Reviewed OCI will select at least 60 enrollees for review during the phase I audits and has updated WIHSP policies and procedures to reflect a requirement that at least two enr ollees are reviewed for each insurer. The number of enrollees pulled per insurer continues to be based on insurer WIHSP claim volume, however, at least two from each insurer will be reviewed . In some years, this will lead to a n overall sample size of over 60 enrollees. Fo r PY 2021, this process resulted in 65 enrollee samples. Beginning with the PY 2021 phase II verification audit, OCI will require insurers to provide proof of payment for two claims associated with each of the individuals reviewed during phase I. Second ary Review OCI has implemented a secondary review process applying to a select number of enrollees and claims during both phases of the audit process. 1 According to the Microsoft support website, \" The RANDARRAY function returns an array of -21261e55 -3bec -4885- 86a6- 8b0a47fd4d33 138 SUMMARY SCHEDULE OF PRIOR AUDIT FINDINGS Department of Administration Financial Statement Findings SSTTAATTEE OOFF WWIISSCCOONNSSIINN DDEEPPAARRTTMMEENNTT , 53707 -7844 Phone: (608) Status of Prior Year Audit Findings Finding: Department of Administration Information Technology Oversight and Monitoring Responsibilities (2021 - 001, 2020- 002, 2019- 003, 2018 -004, 2017- 005) Status of Audit Finding: Partially Corrected Planned Correcti ve Action: DET continues to work with executive branch agencies that are not in compliance with the State of Wisconsin IT Security Policy Handbook and related Standards.

UW institution expectations for this effort were detailed in a February 8, 2021, memo by former President Tommy Thompson and UW System Board of Regents President Andrew Petersen. Institutions are requi red to complete bi -monthly compliance reports detailing their status of compliance with existing IS policies. The formats for these reports are developed and updated by UWSA's Office of Information Security (OIS) on an annual basis based on UW System's lar gest areas of policy risk and to incorporate new or revised policies and policy requirements. OIS reviews these compliance reports and makes them available to UW System leadership. The results of these reports, supplemented by policy compliance verificatio n efforts from internal audit, influence systemwide security discussions, strategy, and resource allocation through direct and indirect means. For example, UWSA hosts the Technology and Information Security Council, a group of UW System security leaders th at meet monthly to discuss ways to enhance information security practices and share strategies on meeting policy objectives. OIS has also been conducting campus visits to better understand challenges with policy compliance and to help identify and remove b arriers. Policy compliance is a never -ending journey for the UW System community as policies are continuously updated to align with evolving industry standards and regulations. The policy compliance monitoring system is one of the tools used to reduce the UW System's attack surface and risk posture.

During that conversation, DWD lead ership asked if DOL would provide written support for DWD's use of predictive analytics in this manner. While impressed with the project, US DOL responded to the request during a subsequent call that US DOL declined to provide written assurance regarding Wisconsin's use of analytics because that was outside the role of DOL.

(SFA) CLUSTER 239 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A. Purpose The Schedule of Expenditures of Fede ral Awards presents a summary of the State of Wisconsin's expenditures funded by the federal government for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. For purposes of the schedule, federal programs have been classified as follow s: 1) Individual Programs and Other Clusters, including grants received directly from the federal government and subawards received from other organizations; 2) the Research and Development (R&D) Cluster, including R&D grants received directly from the federal government and R&D sub awards received from other entities; and 3) the Student Financial Assistance (SFA) Cluster. Direct federal awards and subawards ar e presented for each federal agency by the Assistance Listing number (ALN) when available in the grant agreements or determinable based on an award's source and purpose. For grants that did not clearly state an AL N, the schedule includes the award, or a total for several awards, with an ALN th at ends in \"N/A\" for not available. An \"other identifying number,\" when av ailable, is required to be shown if the ALN is not available. In order to separately identify expenditures associated with the response to th e Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), the designation of \"COVID-19\" has been a dded as a prefix to the applicable grant program names for grants that were fully or partially funded by COVID-19 legislation. For grants that had both COVID-19 and nonCOVID19 related expenditures, the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related expenditures are presented on separate lines in the schedule. Because the schedule presents only a sele cted portion of the activities of the State, it is not intended to and does not present the financial position or results of operations of the State. Notes to the State of Wisconsin Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards 240 NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS B. Basis of Accounting The accompanying Schedule of Expend itures of Federal Awards has been prepared from the accounting and in ventory records of Wisconsin state agencies, including the University of Wisconsin (UW) System, and from federal reports submitted by the state agencies to the various federal grantor agencies. The State's accounting records are maintained on a budgetary basis, in accordance with Wisconsin Statutes. State statutes and state accounting policies require that disbursements be recognized in the fiscal year in which they are recorded for payment, except for certain state employee fringe benefits and selected other items that are recognized in the period to which the payments relate, regardless of when paid. The State's centralized accounting records remain open for a period of time after June 30 to permit the recording of expenditures applicable to the fiscal year ended June 30, in accordance with Wisconsin Statutes. Expenditures and amounts provided to subrecipient s in the schedule are presented in accordance with the budgetary basis of accounting as described in this paragraph, except for amounts relate d to Unemployment Insurance (UI) (Assistance Listing number 17.225), which are reported on the accrual basis of accounting (Note 7), and th e Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (Assistance Listing number 10.551), which are reported based on settlement and issuance data (Note 17). A timing variance may exist between the recording of federal grant expenditures in the accounting records and the reporting of the expenditures to the federal governme nt or other pass-through entities. Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance) requires the Schedule of Expenditures of Fede ral Awards to include the amount provided to subrecipients under each federal program. The amount provided to subrecipients under each federal program was determined by the state agencies. Amounts provided to subrecipients on the schedule reflect subawards made by a state agen cy to another entity outside of the State's reporting entity. To eliminate double counting of su bawards between state agencies, the schedule includes expenditures reported by the state agency that received and ultimately expended the subawarded funds but does not include these expenditures in the reported totals of the pass-through state agency. For subawards between state agencies, the pass-through state agency is cited within parentheses after the program name. C. State Agencies Included The following state agencies were included in the scope of the federal compliance portion of the audit. Stat e agencies that administered a major federal program audited during the FY 2021-22 single audit are indicated in bold . 1. Board for People with Developmental Disabilities (BPDD) 2.

Through a contract wi th the Wisconsin Humanities Council, UW System is responsibl e for fiscal and personne l administration of the Council. At the request of the Wiscon sin Humanities Council, the Council was included as a unit within UW System. Federal awards administered by th e Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, and the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics Authority were not included in the scop e of this audit. These entities had single audits performed by ot her auditors, as necessary. 2. USE OF DE MINIMUS COST RATE DVA elected to use the 10 percent de mini mis cost rate for indirect costs during FY 2021-22. No other state agencies elected to use the 10 percent de minimis cost rate permitted under 2 CFR s. 200.414 of Uniform Guidance. 3. FEDERAL SANCTIONS AND DISALLOWANCES There are actual or potential federa l sanctions and disallowances for the Medical Assistance (MA) Program (Ass istance Listing number 93.778), the Community Development Block Grants/S tate's program and Non-Entitlement Grants in Hawaii (CDBG) (Assistance Listing number 14.228) program, the ERate program from the federal Universal Service Fund (USF), the AmeriCorps Volunteers in Service to America (V ISTA) program (Assistance Listing number 94.013), and the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program (Assistance Listing number 21.023). A. Reporting and Refunding the Federal Share of Medicaid-Related Settlements and a Judgment On August 14, 2018, DHS received a draft report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) recommending a disallowance related to the Medicaid Program. The OIG review covered the period from October 2008 through September 2016. The OIG concluded that DHS did not report and refund the full federal share of Medicaid-related settlements in the amount of $27.6 million. DHS partially disagreed with the report. The Center s for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reviewed the report and determined that the DHHS OIG underreported the settlement and requested that DHS refund $31.0 million to the federal government. DHS submitted a formal obje ction letter to CMS in February 2021. On August 17, 2022, CMS issued a disa llowance in the amount of $24.9 million. DHS intends to appeal this disallowance. B. Disallowances for Community Dev elopment Block Grant/State's Program and Non-Entitlement Grants in Hawaii The U.S. Department of Housing an d Urban Development (HUD) provided funding to the State through the CDBG Cluster. In FY 2015-16, HUD issued a finding of noncompliance related to the State's closeout system and directed the State to undertake a review of old, open activities. DOA took corrective action to close out activities as possible, reporting the status of NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS 243 its efforts to HUD on a periodic basis. In late FY 2017-18, HUD performed an on-site review of those activities . In FY 2018-19, HUD advised that it would require DOA to reimburse the St ate's local account with nonfederal funds in the amount of $7.3 million, an d to continue to collect $2.2 million that is being repaid by the units of local government. In February 2020, the State requested that HUD approve a $7.3 million voluntary grant reduction over a two-year period to satisf y the reimbursement requirement from HUD. In January 2021, HUD notified the State of a grant reduction of $3.7 million, which was applied to each of the federal fiscal year 2021 and 2022 grants and satisfied the reimbursement requirement. C. E-Rate Federal Funds Disallowance The federal e-rate program provides funding from the federal universal service fund (USF) to reimburse the st ate for a percentage of funds used to support telecommunications availability in schools and libraries, provided primarily through the state's Techno logy for Educational Achievement (TEACH) program administered by DOA. On December 30, 2022, the Universal Service Administrative Co mpany (\"USAC\"), acting on behalf of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC or Commission), notified TEACH that it had received improper payments of $1,206,542 from the Universal Service Fund and that the amount must be repaid by March 31, 2023. DOA intends to repay the amount as required. D. Volunteers in Service to America Disallowance Serve Wisconsin, the National and Co mmunity Service Board of the State of Wisconsin attached to the Departme nt of Administration, sponsors the AmeriCorps Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) program for the State of Wisconsin. The Corporation for National and Community Service, operating as AmeriCorps, notified Serv e Wisconsin that it has disallowed $46,846 of costs as a result of a pre-employment criminal history background check failing to meet th e National Service Criminal History Checks (NSCHS) standards required by the National and Community Service Act of 1990, as amended by the Serve America Act (SAA). Serve Wisconsin has requested that AmeriCorps reduce a future grant by the amount of the disallowance in lieu of repayment. E. Emergency Rental Assistance Excess Funds Determination The ERA Program, a program of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) established under the Cons olidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and continued under the American Resc ue Plan Act (ARPA) as \"ERA2,\" is administered by DOA. In February 2023, Treasury provided notification to DOA of an ERA2 Quarter 3 (September 30, 2022) Assessment Excess Funds Determination of $31,374,234, an amount equal to the balance undrawn from Treasury as of the notification date. In March 2023, DOA appealed the determination under the bases that Treasury was considering incomplete data and that the Stat e would voluntarily reallocate any amount subject to an Excess Fund s Determination. DOA provided additional information to Treasury and is awaiting its review of that information. 244 NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS 4. FOOD COMMODITIES Food commodities distributed during the fiscal year are reported as expenditures in the Schedule of Expe nditures of Federal Awards under the various federal programs that distri buted the commodities. The value of food commodities distributed during the fiscal year and the amount of food commodities on hand as of June 30, 2022, are shown in Table A for each program distributing food commodities. Table A Food Commodity Assistance Assistance Listing Number Federal Program Distributed Inventory Balance June 30, 2022 10.555 National School Lunch Program $ 17,871,166 $ 35,429 10.559 Summer Food Service Program for Children 185,704 0 10.565 Commodity Supplemental Food Program 3,382,271 0 10.569 Emergency Food Assistance Program 21,622,729 1,545,942 Total $43,061,870 $1,581,371 5. WIC SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NU TRITION PROGRAM FOR WOMEN, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN REBATES During FY 2021-22, DHS received $18,604,682 in cash rebates from infant formula manufacturers from the sale of formula to participants in WIC Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (Assistance Listing number 10.557). Rebate contract s with infant formula manufacturers are authorized by 7 CFR s. 246.16 (m) as a cost containment measure. Rebates represent a reduction of expenditures pr eviously incurred for WIC food benefit costs. Applying the rebates received to such costs enabled DHS to extend program benefits to 27,918 more people than could have been served during FY 2021-22 in the absence of the rebate contracts. 6. COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANTS/STATE'S PROGRAM AND NON-ENTITLEMENT GRANTS IN HAWAII CDBG provides funds to local units of government to complete infrastructure and facility projects or to grant or loan funds to businesses to assist with job creation and retention, or to homeowners or landlords to assist with housing rehabilitation and homebuyer assistance . Loan repayments received by units of local government in excess of certain limits must be returned to the State. Included in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards as expenditures of the program is a total of $2,520,240 that was supported by funds returned to the State. NOTES TO THE SCHEDULE OF EXPENDITURES OF FEDERAL AWARDS 245 7. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE UI is a joint federal-state program financed by federal taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and by state payroll taxes under the State Unemployment Tax Act. The underlying framework of the UI system is contained in the Social Security Act (SSA). Title III of the SSA authorizes grants to states for the administration of state UI laws; Title IX authorizes the various components of the federal Unemployment Trust Fund. All reserves must be held by the federal Unemployment Trus t Fund and cannot be commingled with other state funds. With limited exceptio ns, reserves may be used only to pay unemployment benefits. For this reason , the Wisconsin Unemployment Reserve Fund is accounted for outside of the State's central accounting system, and expenditures for UI are reported on the accrual basis of accounting, which recognizes expenditures in the period incurred, regardless of when the payment is made. FY 2021-22 expenditures in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards for UI (Assistance Listing number 17.225) in clude $338,968,857 in benefits funded by the Wisconsin Unemployment Reserve Fund; $1,857,811 in federally funded benefits; $331,770,408 in COVID-19 federally funded benefits; $98,708,279 in federally funded administrative costs; $7,910,881 in COVID-19 federally funded administrative costs; and $1,483,088 in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) federally funded costs. 8. HIGHWAY PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION Expenditures in the Schedule of Expend itures of Federal Awards for Highway Planning and Construction (Assistance Listing number 20.205) include $276,786 in project charges that have been incurre d in excess of the federally approved project budget amount. DOT will seek fede ral approval for increases to project budgets, and federal reimbursements are expected in the next fiscal year. 9. DONATION OF FEDERAL SURPLUS PERSONAL PROPERTY DOA is responsible for administration of the Donation of Federal Surplus Personal Property program (Assistance Listing number 39.003).

Planned Corrective Action: The Wisconsin Department of Administration ( DOA or Department ) Bureau of Financial Management (BFM) will evaluate federal grant expenditures reported in the STAR General Ledger as it prepares its schedule of expenditures of federal awards (SEFA) and ensure it is adjusting expenditures for material prior- year tr ansfers of expenditures in the current year in a manner consistent with requirements of the Office of Management and Budget Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance or Guidance ) and additional guidance , if any, provided by the Department's State Controller's Office (SCO). The Uniform Guidance requires th e prepar ation of a SEFA for the period covered by the State's financial statements that in clude s total federal awards expended [ref . 2 CFR 200.510 (b)] ; the determination of when a federal award is expended to be based on when the activity related to the federal award occurs [ref. 2 CFR 200.502]; and that the financial statements and SEFA are for the same audit period [ref. 2 CFR 200.514]. As the auditors noted, in preparing DOA 's SEFA, DOA BFM sought to ref lect the amou nt of federal awards expended for DOA 's grant program s based on the amounts reported in the STAR general ledger . Together with reporting negative expenditures resulting from the transfers of FY 2019 -20 and FY 2020- 21 expenditures within the Notes to the SEFA, which are an integral par t of the SEFA and required by 2 CFR 200.510 (b)(6) , and ab sent OMB guidance that prescribe s a uniform method fo r reporting a transfer of prior year grant expenditures , DOA BFM believed its approach was consis tent with the requirements of 2 CFR 200.502 and 2 CFR 200.510 (b), more generally . DOA BFM late r mod ified its SEFA to exclude negative expenditures resulting from the transfers of FY 2019 - 20 and FY 2020- 21 expenditures consistent with the manner in which a prior perio d adjust ment would be reflected within current -year activity in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) , as describe d in the crite ria and recomm ended by the auditors. The increased expenditures for the Coronavirus Relief Fund (Assistance Listing numbe r 21.019) and Coro navirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (Assistance Listing number 21.027) in the S EFA of $241.3 million and $192.1 million, respectively , together with any fu ture exclusions of negative expenditures resulting from the transfer of prior- year expenditures, will cause the lifetime expenditures 270 CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS Finding 2022-103 Page 2 on the SEFA schedule for th ese program s to reflect more expenditures than federal funding received.

Planned Corrective Action: DOA BFM will assess the transfer of prior- year expenditures in the current year to determine any potential effects on the total federal expenditures for the prior- year and the effect on the major program expenditures . It has been the practice of DOA BFM to assess the trans fer of prior year expenditures in the current year and DOA BFM will continue to prioritize decisions with respect to the same to allow the Department to maximize the availability of federal funding for the purposes intended.

Wisconsin Department of Health Services Planned Corrective Action: Based on the LAB findings, the DMS Bureau of Quality and Oversight (BQO) will implement a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) with the IRIS Fiscal Employer Agent (FEA), iLIFE. A review of the LAB findings indicates that iLIFE inadvertently issued a payment to an IRIS participant -hired worker (PHW) based on a service authorization associated with a participant that the PHW did not support. The IRIS provider agreement indicates that FEA's are responsible for verifying invoices, timesheets, and other claims for pay ment for services and periods of time authorized by participants' service plans. iLIFE indicated their system's optical character recognition (OCR) misread a PHW's employee identification number causing the payment to be sent to the wrong PHW resulting i n an overpayment. iLIFE will be required to fix their OCR and review process to complete the CAP. BQO will issue a CAP notification to iLIFE by March 27, 2023.

This is the department's Corrective Action Plan. Recommendation (2022-302): Multiple Grants - Reporting in the Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Health Services further evaluate federal grant expenditures reported in the STAR General Ledger as it prepares its schedule of expenditures of federal awards and ensure it is : adjust ing expenditures for prior -year transfers of expenditures in the current year. Wisconsin Department of Health Services Planned Corrective Action: DHS adjusted the expenditures for prior -year transfers of expenditures as recommended by LAB though DHS believe s that there is no clearly defined direct authoritative guidance provided by OMB mandating a uniform method for reporting a transfer of prior yea r grant expenditures. Because of this, DHS believes it is prudent to seek confirmation of this treatment from the federal government going forward. LAB, in describing the effect, indicates that \"the State under -reported expenditures for the ELC grant by $55.9 million.\" These expenditures were previously reported in prior fiscal years. Upon approval of the State's FEMA project workbook, and in accordance with the compliance supplement, these previously reported expenditures were reported in FY 2021- 22 under the Disaster Grants \u2014Public Assistance (Presidentially Declared Disasters) (Assistance Listing number 97.036) grant. Without a matching reduction in expenditures to the ELC grant by $55.9 million, DHS is concerned that the lifetime expenditures on the SEFA schedule for these grant programs are going to reflect more expenditures than 278 CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS Finding 2022-302 Memo to Carolyn Stittleburg March 2 7, 2023 Page 2 federal funding received. Additionally, because there is not direct authoritative guidance currently provided by OMB mandating a uniform method for reporting a transfer of prior year grant expenditures, DHS will work with DOA to seek clarification from the Federa l Government on the proper treatment and reporting of transfers of prior year expenditures on the SEFA. Anticipated Completion Date: November 1, 2023 We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Health Services further evaluate federal grant expenditures reported in the STAR General Ledger as it prepares its schedule of expenditures of federal awards and ensure it is : properly identifying applicable COVID -19 expenditures; reporting all federal expenditures for each federal grant program, regardless of whet her the agency has received reimbursement from the pass- through entity; and removing repayments of prior -year overpayments of expenditures from current- year expenditures. Wisconsin Department of Health Services Planned Corrective Action: DHS will ensure that it reviews the instructions that are received from DOA and present the proper amounts in the SEFA. This will include a review of adjustments made to grants open in prior state fiscal years and verification that they have not already been report ed on the SEFA in a prior year, such as the WIC adjustment identified.

Recommendation (2022-303): Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act Reporting - Immunization Cooperative Agreements We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Health Services: Update the queries used to identify subawards in the State's accounting system, STAR, that are subject to Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act reporting to ensure all required subawards are identified; and Ensure all required subwards of $30,000 or more, including any amendments or modifications to a subaward, are identified and submitted to the Federal Fund Accountability and Transparency Act Subaward Reporting System in a timely manner. Wisconsin Department of Health Services Planned Corrective Action: BFS agrees that the circumstances shaped by the COVID emergency required BFS to prioritize tasks critical to essential functions over those with little to no financial impact. Furthermore, during this same period, there was turnover in this position. Lack of priority and new staffing led to late reporting. Additionally, procedural misunderstandings contributed to continued reporting delays of the correcting items identified in the first finding. The summer and early F all of 2022 allowed for additional research, clarification, and catching up. Since November of 2022 there have been timely monthly uploads of collected data and it has continued to be reported monthly. BFS also agrees that LAB identified several contracts not yet reported. Upon discovery, BFS made it a priority to take steps necessary to immediately report the missing contracts on the FSRS site. 280 CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS Finding 2022-303 Investigations into the missing contracts revealed that there was an issue with the query being used to pull the STAR data.

This is the department's Corrective Action Plan. Recommendation (2022-304): Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds - Monitoring of Local and Tribal Health Department Response and Recovery Support Program Expenditures We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Health Services: Develop and implement written policies and procedures for the review and tracking of the quarterly reports used to monitor expenditures under the Local and Tribal Health Department Response and Recovery Support program . Wisconsin Department of Health Services Planned Corrective Action: As beneficiaries, the Treasury Guidance indicates that Local and Tribal Health Departments are not subject to subrecipient monitoring and reporting requirements. The designation of beneficiary is unique to the CSL FRF and thus is not as familiar to DHS as the subrecipient designation and subsequent reporting requirements. The uncertainty surrounding this designation resulted in DPH not following the best practices described in the DPH Contract Management Manual. DPH's Contract Management Manual outlines requirements and best practices for contract management. This Manual describes how to best review and track expenditures to monitor expenditures. The Manual encourages the best practice of requesting enhanced expend iture reporting from agencies, in addition to the reporting required for CARS payments. The Manual describes the role of the contract administrator in reviewing the expenditure information against the approved budget to ensure expenses are reasonable and a llowable. The Manual also suggests maintaining copies of submitted reports and verifying the amounts in the submitted reports correspond to CARS reports. Examples of expenditure 282 CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS Finding 2022-304 Memo to Carolyn Stittleburg March 2 3, 2023 Page 2 tracking are provided as is a description of how this tracking and other fiscal monitoring supports bureaus within DPH and DHS. DHS will review the existing policies and procedures in the Contract Management Manual to ensure that the level of detail is suf ficient to prevent further non- compliance. We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Health Services: Maintain the quarterly reports, document its review of the quarterly reports, and document its correspondence with the public health departments regarding resolution of reporting variances. Wisconsin Department of Health Services Planned Corrective Action: DPH hired a position in June 2022 to manage and track expenditures and reporting for its Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds granted to locals and tribal public health departments. DPH will continue to review, track, and maintain quarterly re ports, and document correspondence with the local and tribal public health departments per best practices in the DPH Contract Management Manual. We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Health Services: Review the contracts with the public health departments and determine whether any revisions are needed to clarify expectations for documentation and timeliness of filing the quarterly reports; and Wisconsin Department of Health Services Planned Corrective Action: DPH will review its contracts with the local and tribal public health departments and ensure timely filing of quarterly reports. Specific areas of non -compliance have been identified and division staff will review and draft updated scope of work language to mitigate delays in reporting from our local partners. We recommend the Wisconsin Department of Health Services: Ensure it obtains quarterly reports to support the payments it made to the City of Milwaukee Public Health Department.

Much of the staffing issues were related to Covid -19 both physical availability and turnover. As operations have since normalized, we do not believe a corrective action plan to our procedures is needed. However, we do recognize that we need to catch up on the backlog of inventory. Since June 30, 2022, Property Control has hired three new employees and is now fully staffed. We are in the middle of conducting the FY 2022 -23 physic al inventories. We selected 45 departments and a total of 6089 assets. Of the total asset count 5295 were federal equipment, which is 62% of all federal equipment for FY 2022 - 23.

In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of the other auditors, th e accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all ma terial respects, the respec tive financial position of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggrega te remaining fund information of the State of Wisconsin as of June 30, 2022, the respective chan ges in financial position, and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in ac cordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We did not audit the financial st atements for the Environmental Improvement Fund, which is a major fund and represents 14.2 percent of the assets of the business-type acti vities, and the Deferred Compensation Fund, which represents 3.5 percent of the assets of the aggregate remaining fund information. Those financial statements were audi ted by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinions, insofar as they re late to the amounts included for these funds, are based solely on the reports of the other auditors. In addition, we did not audi t the financial statements of the Wisconsin Housing and Econ omic Development Authority, the University of Wisconsin (UW) Hospitals and Clinics Authority, and the UW Founda tion, which represent 98.9 percent of the total assets and deferred outflows of resources of th e aggregate discretely presented component units. Those financial statements were audited by other au ditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion on the aggregate discretely presen ted component units is based solely upon these audit reports. Basis for Opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with auditi ng standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applic able to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , which is issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Audito r's Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the State of Wisconsin, and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we ha ve obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 4 a basis for our audit opinions. The financial stat ements for the Environmental Improvement Fund, UW Hospitals and Clinics Authority, and the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority were audited by other auditors in ac cordance with these standards. The financial statements of the Deferred Compensation Fund and the UW Foundation were audited by other auditors in accordance with auditing standards gener ally accepted in the United States of America, but not in accordance with Government Auditing Standards . Emphases of Matter As discussed in Note 5B, the fi nancial statements include investments that do not have readily ascertainable market prices and are valued base d on a variety of third-party pricing methods. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed. As discussed in Note 5B to the fi nancial statements, as of June 30, 2022, the State Investment Fund held $4.7 billion in a repurchase agreement with the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS). The investments of the State Investment Fund and th e WRS are both administered by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Certain account balances cannot be measured pr ecisely but must be estimated, particularly actuarially accrued liabilit ies and infrastructure assets reported in the financial statements and notes. Notes 14, 17, 18, and 20 include a discussion of esti mates used by funds that accrue liabilities based upon actuarial information, including assumptions used in their calculation, and other sources. Note 1E includes information related to the esti mated historical cost of infrastructure assets constructed prior to July 1, 20 00. Because estimates are based upon information available when the financial statements are prepared, actual valu es may differ from the estimated amounts. These differences cannot be quantified. As discussed in Note 1D to the financial statements, the St ate of Wisconsin implemented Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement Number 87, Leases , which changed accounting and financial reporting for leases. As repo rted in Note 23 to the financial statements, some beginning net position amounts were restated to re flect implementation of this new standard. Our opinions are not modified with respect to these matters. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fa ir presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally acce pted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free fr om material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, managemen t is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate , that raise substantial doubt about the State of Wisconsin's ability to continue as a going concer n for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter. Auditor's Responsibility for the A udit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute 5 assurance. Therefore, reasonable assurance is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement wh en it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is high er than one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentio nal omissions, misrepresentations , or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if ther e is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and Government Auditing Standards , we exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. We a lso identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether du e to fraud or error, and designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disc losures in the financial statements. In addition, we obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that were appropriate in the circ umstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the State of Wi sconsin's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. We also evaluated the appr opriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estima tes made by management, and evaluated the overall presentation of the financial statements. We also concluded, in our judgment, there were no conditions or events, considered in the aggregat e, that raise substantial doubt about the State of Wisconsin's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those ch arged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit. Required Supplementary Information Accounting principles generally accepted in th e United States of America require that the Management's Discussion and Analysis, and the fo llowing items in the required supplementary information section, as listed in the table of contents\u2014Postemployment Benefits-State Health Insurance Program, Postemployment Benefits-Sta te Life Insurance Program, Postemployment Benefits-Supplemental Health Insurance Conversion Credit Program, State's Proportionate Share of Net Pension Liability or Net Pension (Asset), State's Pension Contributions, Infrastructure Assets Reported Using the Modified Approach, Budgetary Comparison Schedule-General Fund, Budgetary Comparison Schedule-Transportation Fund, and Notes to Required Supplementary Information-Budgetary Information\u2014be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of managemen t and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the GASB who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in th e United States of America. These procedures consisted of inquiries of management about the me thods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency wi th management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any a ssurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 6 Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also is sued our report dated December 20, 2022, and published in report 22-26, on our consideration of the State of Wisconsin's internal control over financial repo rting; our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements; and othe r matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal contro l over financial reporting and compliance and the result of that testing, and not to provide an opin ion on the effectiveness of the State of Wisconsin's internal control over financial report ing or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be used when considering the State of Wisconsin's internal control over financial report ing and compliance. LEGISLATIVE AUDIT BUREAU December Management's Discussion and Analysis of the State of Wisconsin's Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) presents a discussion and analysis of the State's financial performance during the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2022. It should be read in conjunction with the transmittal letter located at the front of this ACFR, and the State's financial statements, including the note disclosures which are an integral part of the statements, that follow this part of the ACFR. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS -- PRIMARY GOVERNMENT Government-wide (Tables 2 and 3 on Pages 11 and 12) Net Position . The assets plus deferred outflows of resources of the State of Wisconsin exceeded its liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources at the close of Fiscal Year 2022 by $36.9 billion (reported as \"net position\"). Of this amount, $(2.8) billion was reported as \"unrestricted net position\". A positive balance in unrestricted net position would represent the amount available to be used to meet a government's ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors. Changes in Net Position . The State's total net position increased by $5.7 billion in Fiscal Year 2022. Net position of governmental activities increased by $5.2 billion or 26.4 percent, while net position of the business-type activities showed a increase of $558.8 million or 4.8 percent. Excess of Revenues over (under) Expenses -- Governmental Activities . During Fiscal Year 2022, the State's total revenues for governmental activities of $43.7 billion were $6.6 billion more than total expenses (excluding transfers) for governmental activities of $37.1 billion. Of these expenses, $20.1 billion were covered by program revenues. General revenues, generated primarily from various taxes, totaled $23.5 billion. Fund Governmental Funds -- Fund Balances . As of the close of Fiscal Year 2022, the State's governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $8.1 billion, an increase of $3.7 billion in comparison with the prior year. Of this total amount, $2.2 billion represents the unassigned fund balances. General Fund -- Fund Balance . At the end of Fiscal Year 2022, total fund balance was $4.6 billion, a change of $3.5 billion from $1.2 billion in the prior year. The unassigned fund balance for the General Fund was $2.2 billion, or 6.7 percent of total General Fund expenditures. Additional information regarding individual funds begins on page 16. Long-term Debt The State's total long-term debt obligations (bonds, notes, and certificates of participation payable) decreased by $365.7 million during the current fiscal year which represents the net difference between new issuances, payments and refundings of outstanding debt. Decreases in debt resulted primarily from repayments in excess of new debt issued. During the year repayments of general obligation debt exceeded new issuances by $102.1 million. Repayments of certificates of participation exceeded new issuances by $1.5 million. Revenue bonds outstanding decreased by $78.8 million. Annual appropriation bonds outstanding decreased by $183.3 million. Additional detail regarding these activities begins on page 21. OVERVIEW OF THE FI NANCIAL STATEMENTS The Financial Section of this A CFR c onsists of four parts: (1) management's discu ssion and analysis (this section) , (2) basic financial statements, (3) additional required sup plementary information, and ( 4) o ptional other supplementary information. Parts (2), (3), and (4) are briefly descr ibed on th e following pa ges:S tate of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 8Basic Financial Statements The basic financial statements include two sets of statements that present different views of the State -- the government-wide financial statements and the fund financial statements . These financial statements also include notes that explain some of the information in the financial statements and provide more detail. The government-wide financial statements provide a broad view of the State's operations. The statements provide both short-term and long-term information about the State's financial status, which assists in assessing the State's financial condition at the end of the fiscal year. The fund financial statements focus on individual parts of the State government, reporting the State's operations in greater detail than the government-wide statements. The basic fund financial statements provide more detailed information on the State's most significant funds. Table 1, below, summarizes the major features of the financial statements. Table 1 Major Features of State of Wisconsin's Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements GOVERNMENT-WIDE STATEMENTS FUND STATEMENTS Governmental Funds Proprietary Funds Fiduciary Funds Scope Entire State government (except fiduciary funds) and the State's component units, reported as follows: Governmental Activities - Most services generally associated with State government fall into this category, including commerce, education, transportation, environmental resources, human relations and resources, general executive, judicial and legislative. Business-Type Activities - Those operations for which a fee is charged to external users for goods and services are reported in this category. Discretely Presented Component Units - These are operations for which the State has financial accountability but that have certain independent qualities. The State's discretely presented component units are discussed in Note 1-B to the financial statements.These funds report activities of the State that are not proprietary or fiduciary in nature. Most of the basic services provided by the State, which are primarily financed through taxes, intergovernmental revenues, and other nonexchange revenues, are reported as governmental funds. Examples of the State's governmental funds (including the State's two major governmental funds), as reported within their respective fund types, follow: General Fund (major fund) Special Revenue: -Transportation (major fund) Debt Service: -Bond Projects: -Capital Improvement Permanent: -Common SchoolThe activities the State operates similar to private business. These funds are used to show activities that operate more like those of commercial enterprises. Fees are charged for services provided, both to outside customers and to other units of the State. Examples of the State's proprietary funds, including the State's three major enterprise funds, follow: Enterprise: -Environmental Improvement (major fund) -University of Wisconsin System (major fund) -Unemployment Reserve (major fund) -Lottery Internal services: -Technology Services -Facilities Operations and MaintenanceThese funds are used to show assets held by the State as trustee or agent for others and cannot be used to support the State's own programs. Examples of the State's fiduciary funds, as reported within their respective fund types, follow: Pension and Other Employee Benefit Trust Funds: -Wisconsin Retirement System Investment Trust: -Local Government Pooled Investment Private Purpose Trust: -Tuition Trust Custodial: -Support Collection Trust Required financial statementsStatement of net position - Presents all of the government's assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as \"net position\". Over time, increases or decreases in the State's net position is an indicator of whether its financial health is improving or weakening, respectively. Statement of activities - Presents a comparison between direct expenses and program revenues for each function of the State's governmental activities and for different identifiable business-type activities of the State.Balance sheet Statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balancesStatement of net position Statement of revenues, expenses and changes in fund net position Statement of cash flowsStatement of fiduciary net position Statement of changes in fiduciary net position Because the State cannot use these assets to finance its operations, fiduciary funds are not included in the government-wide financial statements discussed in the left column. (Table 1, continued)State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 9Table 1 (Continued) Major Features of State of Wisconsin's Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements GOVERNMENT-WIDE STATEMENTS FUND STATEMENTS Governmental Funds Proprietary Funds Fiduciary Funds Accounting basis and measurement focusAccrual accounting and economic resource focus The accrual basis of accounting, which is similar to the methods used by most businesses, takes into account all revenues and expenses associated with the fiscal year even if cash involved has not been received or paid.Modified accrual accounting and current financial resource focus These statements provide a detailed short-term view of the State's finances that assists in determining whether there will be adequate financial resources available to meet the current needs of the State. Because this information does not encompass the long-term focus of the government-wide statements, reconciliations are provided on the subsequent page of the governmental fund statements.Accrual accounting and economic resources focusAccrual accounting and economic resources focus Type of asset, deferred outflows of resources, liability, deferred inflows of resources informationAll assets and liabilities, both financial and capital, and short-term and long- term.

The required supplementary information includes: Postemployment Benefits - State Health Insurance Program, State Life Insurance Program and Supplemental Health Insurance Conversion Credit Program, State's Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability or Net Pension Asset, State's Pension Contributions, Infrastructure Assets Reported Using the Modified Approach, and Budgetary Comparison Schedule of the General and the Transportation funds (includes reconciliations between the statutory and GAAP fund balances at fiscal year-end). Other Supplementary Information The Other Supplementary Information includes combining financial statements for nonmajor governmental funds, nonmajor enterprise funds, internal service funds and fiduciary funds, each of which are added together and presented in single columns in the basic financial statements.State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 10FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE STATE AS A WHOLE Tables 2 and 3 present summary information of the State's net position and changes in net position. Net Position As presented in Table 2, total assets of the State on June 30, 2022 were $65.8 billion and deferred outflows of resources were $5.3 billion , while total liabilities were $28.2 billion and deferred inflows of resources were $6.0 billion , resulting in combined net position (governmental and business-type activities) of $36.9 billion . The largest component of the State's total net position consists of $26.5 billion invested in capital assets (i.e., land, buildings, equipment, infrastructure, and others), less any related debt outstanding that was needed to acquire or construct the assets. Approximately $13.2 billion of net position was restricted by external sources or the State Constitution or Statutes and was not available to finance the day-to-day operations of the State. The unrestricted net position, which, if positive, could be used at the State's discretion, showed a negative balance of $(2.8) billion . Therefore, based on this measurement, no funds were available for discretionary purposes. A contributing factor to the negative balance is that governments recognize a liability on the government-wide statement of net position as soon as an obligation is incurred. While financing focuses on when a liability will be paid, accounting is primarily concerned with when a liability is incurred. Accordingly, the State recognizes long-term liabilities (such as general obligation debt, compensated absences, other postemployment benefits and future benefits and loss liabilities - listed in Note 10 to the financial statements) on the statement of net position. During Fiscal Year 2022 , the State issued $1.0 billion of general obligation bonds, primarily for the acquisition or improvement of land, water, property, highways, buildings, and equipment. At June 30, 2022 general obligation bonds and long-term general obligation notes outstanding totaled $7.5 billion. Certificates of participation, annual appropriation bonds, and revenue bonds are not considered general obligation debt of the State. The outstanding amount of these totaled $67.7 million of certificates of participation, $2.7 billion of annual appropriation bonds, and $2.3 billion of revenue bonds.

The State earned program revenues of $28.7 billion and general revenues of $23.5 billion for total revenues of $52.2 billion during Fiscal Year 2022 . Expenses for the State during Fiscal Year 2022 were $46.5 billion . As a result of the excess of revenues over expenses, the total net position of the State increased $5.7 billion , net of contributions and transfers.

Revenues for the governmental activities (including contributions to permanent fund principal) totaled $43.7 billion , while expenses and net transfers totaled $38.5 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 . General and program revenues of governmental activities increased $4.7 billion during Fiscal Year 2022 . Tax revenues increased $2.7 million primarily due to enhanced income taxes and sales and excise taxes of $2.0 billion and $621.1 million , respectively. Motor fuel taxes, other taxes and public utility taxes also increased $40.7 million , $33.7 million and $12.7 million , respectively, from the prior year. Operating grants and capital grants increased by $1.8 billion and $ 85.2 million , respectively. In addition charges for services and other revenues increased $82.0 million and $ 33.4 million , respectively. The State's governmental activities program expenses increased $2.3 billion to $ 37.1 billion during Fiscal Year 2022 . Human relations and resources expenses increased by $ 1.8 billion (10.3 percent) to a total of $ 19.5 billion, due to increases in medical costs. General executive expenses decreased $(375.0) million (17.9 percent) to a total of $ 1.7 billion, due to decreased CARES and ARPA expenditures compared to Fiscal Year 2021. Education expenses increased by $ 726.1 million (8.7 percent) to $9.1 billion, due to increases in general equalization aids, parental choice program for eligible school districts, per pupil aid and aids for special education and school-age parents programs. Commerce, intergovernmental, and legislative expenses increased $ 24.6 million , $10.6 million , and $ 7.1 million , respectively. Conversely, tax relief and other general expenses, environmental resource and judicial expenses decreased $ 48.3 million , $22.2 million , and $ 0.4 million , respectively. Interest on long-term debt also decreased $42.1 million . As shown in Table 4, below, approximately 52.0 percent of revenues from all sources earned came from taxes (sales and excise, income, public utility, motor fuel, and other taxes). Operating grants and contributions represent amounts received from other governments/entities - primarily the federal government.

Revenues of business-type activities totaled $ 8.6 billion for Fiscal Year 2022 , a decrease of $2.2 billion from the prior year. Program revenues consisted of $ 7.4 billion of charges for services, $ 1.2 billion of operating grants and contributions, and $18.9 million of capital grants and contributions. General revenues, contributions to endowments and permanent fund principal and net transfers totaled $ (14.9) million , $1.1 million , and $ 1.4 billion , respectively. The total expenses for business-type activities were $ 9.4 billion , a decrease of $2.4 billion from the prior fiscal year. The largest decrease in program expenses, $2.8 billion, related to decreased expenses for the Unemployment Insurance Reserve. Expenses for Injured Patients and Family Compensation also decreased $66.5 million. Offsetting those decreases were increases in University of Wisconsin System, other business-type expenses, Lottery, Health Insurance, Environmental Improvement and Care and Treatment Facilities of $325.5 million, $62.3 million, $61.1 million, $30.3 mi llion, $25.0 million and $10.0 million, respectively.

Funds with significant changes in fund balance are discussed below: General Fund The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At June 30, 2022 , the State's General Fund reported a total fund balance of $4.6 billion . The net change in fund balance during Fiscal Year 2022 was $ 3.5 billion , in contrast to $1.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2021 . Major revenue , expenditure and other sources/uses contributing to the change in fund balance are as follows: Revenues Revenues of the General Fund totaled $ 39.3 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 , an increase of $4.8 billion (13.8 percent) from the prior year. Factors contributing to this change included the following: Revenues from taxes increased $2.6 billion . The increase primarily relates to income and sales taxes, which increased $1.9 billion and $ 663.2 million , respectively, from Fiscal Year 2021 . The income tax increase was the result of growth in personal income, while sales tax revenue increases were driven by increased consumer expenditures for taxable goods. Intergovernmental revenues (i.e., federal assistance) increased $ 2.0 billion to $ 16.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 . Human relations and resources programs (e.g., Medicaid) reported increased revenues of $ 2.4 billion . Federal reimbursements for grant expenditures increased due to COVID-19 along with a general increase in medical assistance costs. At the end of Fiscal Year 2021, the State recorded unearned revenue of $1.6 billion for unspent American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and Coronavirus Relief Funds. In Fiscal Year 2022, $766.3 million of that amount was spent and subsequently earned and recorded as intergovernmental revenue. During Fiscal Year 2022, the State received an additional $1.3 billion under ARPA. The remaining unspent amount was recorded as unearned revenue by the State and will be recorded as intergovernmental revenue in future years as the funds are spent. Expenditures 2021 Wisconsin Act 58 established spending authority for the State of Wisconsin for Fiscal Year 2022 . Expenditures of the General Fund totaled $ 33.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 , an increase of $ 2.2 billion from Fiscal Year 2021 . Factors contributing to the change include the following: Human relations and resources expenditures increased by $ 1.8 billion to $19.4 billion, primarily the result of increased grants and aids to individuals and organizations, in part for coronavirus relief and other medical assistance costs. These costs comprise 57.7 percent of General Fund expenditures. Education expenditures increased $ 718.7 million to 9.0 billion, due in part to increases in parental choice program for eligible school districts, per pupil aid, special needs scholarship program and aids for special education and school- age parents programs in Fiscal Year 2022 . These costs comprise 26.8 percent of General Fund expenditures. Other Financing Sources and Uses Other financing sources/(uses) totaled a net $ (2.3) billion in Fiscal Year 2022 , a $ 262.1 million decrease from Fiscal Year 2021 . The components of this included the following: Transfers out of the General Fund totaled $2.4 billion, an increase of $285.3 million from the prior year. The GPR supplement comprises a large portion of the transfers out and is provided to various enterprise funds. The supplement totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of $37.4 million from the prior year. The University of Wisconsin System, which receives the majority of the GPR supplement, had $998.2 million in GPR expenses in Fiscal Year 2022 , an increase of $36.6 million.State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 16Transfers out for debt service payments to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund totaled $425.0 million in Fiscal Year 2022 compared to $429.2 million in Fiscal Year 2021 . Transfers out to other nonmajor governmental funds were $417.1 million in Fiscal Year 2022 compared to $398.8 million in Fiscal Year 2021 . Transfers out to nonmajor enterprise fund s, Transportation Fund and Unemployment Reserve were $205.8 million, $205.2 million and $60.0 million, respectively. Transfers in to the General Fund increased $2.5 million (from $61.4 million in Fiscal Year 2021 to $63.9 million in Fiscal Year 2022 ). The University of Wisconsin System transferred $ 23.9 million, while nonmajor governmental funds and nonmajor enterprise funds transferred $ 22.1 million and $ 13.9 million, respectively. Note 9D provides additional information on transfers in and out of the General Fund. As of June 30, 2022 , the General Fund reported an unassigned fund balance of $2.2 billion, a change of $ 3.2 billion from the prior year, which had a deficit of $(912.0) million. This is the first year the State's General Fund has ended with a positive unassigned fund balance since the State began issuing an ACFR in Fiscal Year 1990. General Fund Budgetary Highlights Differences between the original budget and the final amended budget were significant and included a $15.0 billion increase in appropriations. Contributing to the variance is the fact that several of the State's programs and various transfers (see the items denoted with *, below) are not included in the original budget. In addition, numerous adjustments to spending estimates were needed as the year progressed because of changing circumstances (spending needs can change dramatically over a one-year period). The largest variances occurred in the following appropriations (in millions): Program Variance Federal Aid CRF and ARPA* $2,939.8 Food Stamps, Electronic Benefit Transfer* 2,529.8 UW System, General Program Operations (part of Statutory General Fund) 1,127.7 Federal Aid Medical Assistance 1,119.2 UW Federal Aid 775.0 DOR Grants 535.4 UW System, Gifts and Nonfederal Grants Contracts 357.3 Inter agency CRF and ARPA Transfer* 345.9 Actual charges to appropriations (expenditures) were $8.7 billion below the final budgeted estimates. Large positive expenditure variances were reported in the the Federal Aid CRF and ARPA ($1.8 billion) appropriations, UW program operations and Federal Aid ($1.7 billion), DCF Medical Assistance Program Benefits ($450.4 million) and DHS Medical Assistance Federal Aid ( $426.8 million). During the past fiscal year, the budgetary-based fund balance increased $2.5 billion for the statutory General Fund, mainly the result of federal funds received under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) which the State has until 2024 to spend and an increase in tax revenues. Net transfers from other funds totaled $(442.3) million in Fiscal Year 2022 compared to $(972.6) million in the prior fiscal year.State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 17Transportation Fund In Fiscal Year 2022 , the Transportation Fund's fund balance increased $ 275.2 million (26.4 percent) from $ 1.0 billion to $1.3 billion . The State constitutionally restricts use of state resources deposited into the Fund for transportation purposes. As such, $ 1.3 billion or 96.7 percent of fund balance is reported as restricted for Fiscal Year 2022 . Remaining fund balance is reported as nonspendable and correlates to prepaid and inventory assets. Primary revenue sources of the fund include motor fuel taxes, intergovernmental, and license and permit revenue sources, as well as interfund transfers in. In Fiscal Year 2022 revenues of the fund increased $103.9 million (3.5 percent) to a total of $3.1 billion . Intergovernmental revenues increased $66.5 million ; use of external sources of funding for projects, rather than state resources regularly contributes to revenue fluctuations in this category between years. License and permit revenues decreased $13.9 million in Fiscal Year 2022 due to decline in vehicle titles registrations, while taxes increased $44.2 million due mainly to an increase in fuel taxes. Transportation expenditures of $ 2.9 billion increased 8.1 percent or $ 215.6 million , including a 16.4 percent or $ 57.8 million increase in capital outlay expenditures . The increase in capital outlay expenditures was the result of increased funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In addition to the expenditures reported in the Transportation Fund, long-term debt- funded transportation expenditures of $72.6 million and $72.6 million were reported in the Capital Improvement Fund and Transportation Revenue Bonds Fund, respectively. In the current year, transportation-related expenditures decreased $35.8 million in the Capital Improvement Fund, and $1.0 million in the Transportation Revenue Bonds Fund. Transfers in increased from $ 62.7 million to $ 228.6 million in Fiscal Year 2022 . This increase is mainly due to a one time transfer from the General Fund of $134.2 million. An on-going transfer equal to 0.25 percent of General Fund taxes as published in the General Fund condition statement is made annually with that amount being $44.7 million in Fiscal Year 2022 . In addition, $23.3 million was transferred from the Petroleum Inspection Special Revenue Fund, compared to $16.2 million transferred in Fiscal Year 2021 . Transfers out decreased $20.4 million to $175.0 million . Transfers out to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund for debt service were $134.5 million, while transfers out to the Conservation Fund were $21.6 million in Fiscal Year 2022 . Proprietary Funds Proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the government-wide financial statements but in more detail. Significant changes to balances of major proprietary funds from Fiscal Year 2021 to Fiscal Year 2022 include the following: Environmental Improvement Fund net position of the Environmental Improvement Fund increased $34.6 million to $ 2.2 billion . Total assets of the Fund increased by $ 108.9 million , while total liabilities also increased by $ 74.2 million. Assets increased to $2.6 billion as the result of loans to local governments increasing $147.4 million , while cash decreased $37.2 million . Liabilities increased to $402.6 million due to a $ 73.4 million increase in revenue bonds payable. Operating income of the Fund increased by $ 1.8 million to $ 27.4 million in Fiscal Year 2022 . Operating revenue of $ 46.7 million, which consists primarily of investment and interest income, remained steady in Fiscal Year 2022 . Operating expenses increased $0.2 million in Fiscal Year 2022 , the result of a $ 1.3 million increase in interest expense and a $ 0.8 million decrease in salaries and benefits.State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 18Unemployment Reserve Net position of the Unemployment Reserve Fund increased by $ 203.0 million during Fiscal Year 2022 from $ 1.2 billion at June 30, 2021 to $1.4 billion at June 30, 2022 . Benefit expenses decreased from $ 3.5 billion in Fiscal Year 2021 to $683.0 million in Fiscal Year 2022 , a decrease of $2.8 billion (80.4 percent). This decrease is attributed to the average unemployment rate decreasing from 4.9 percent during Fiscal Year 2021 to 3.1 percent during Fiscal Year 2022, along with pandemic-related unemployment programs ending on September 4, 2021. Total operating revenues decreased by $ 2.1 billion from $ 2.9 billion in Fiscal Year 2021 to $ 811.2 million in Fiscal Year 2022 . This decrease is mainly the result of Federal aids revenue for the unemployment program decreasing from $2.5 billion in Fiscal Year 2021 to $334.1 million in Fiscal Year 2022 , a decrease of $2.1 billion (86.1 percent). Employer contributions decreased from $ 463.6 million in Fiscal Year 2021 to $ 451.3 million in Fiscal Year 2022 , a decrease of $ 12.3 million (2.7 percent). The average tax rate on taxable wages decreased from 1.4 percent during Calendar Year 2021 to an estimated 1.1 percent in Calendar Year 2022 . Reimbursements of $20.4 million in Fiscal Year 2022 represented an increase of $14.7 million (259.5 percent) from Fiscal Year 2021 . University of Wisconsin System Fund net position increased $435.7 million to $6.4 billion . Assets, which consist primarily of capital assets and cash, increased $650.6 million to $10.7 billion . The Fund reported a restricted net pension asset of $ 1.1 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 , an increase of $253.4 million from Fiscal Year 2021 , along with a restricted net OPEB asset of $ 148.3 million , which was an increase of $23.8 million from $ 124.5 million in Fiscal Year 2021 . The Fund also reported an increase of $ 418.2 million in investments and a decrease of $ 328.7 million in cash in Fiscal Year 2022 . Total liabilities, which consists primarily of bonds payable and OPEB, increased by $ 220.3 million to $3.8 billion . Deferred outflows of resources increased $784.4 million to $2.3 billion and deferred inflows of resources also increased $778.9 million to $ 2.9 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 . The changes in deferred outflows and inflows were primarily related to changes in pension related amounts. Operating revenues increased $419.6 million or 12.2 percent to $ 3.9 billion . Student tuition, and federal grants and contracts of $1.4 billion and $ 917.9 million , respectively, comprise 60.8 percent of operating revenues. Increases of $141.7 million, $87.4 million and $86.8 million were reported for sales and services of auxiliary enterprises, sales and services of educational activities, federal grants and contracts, respectively. Local and private grants and contracts and sales and services to UW Hospital Authority reported increases of $6.6 million and $3.7 million, respectively. Other income revenues also increased by $73.9 million (19.8 percent). Operating expenses increased $417.1 million or 8.5 percent. Personal services, supplies and services, scholarship and fellowships, depreciation and other expenses increased by $156.9 million, $125.1 million, $83.8 million, $44.6 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Offsetting those changes were decreases in nonoperating investment and interest income, gifts and donations and miscellaneous revenues of $192.7 million, $22.3 million, and $10.1 million, respectively, while operating grants increased $44.8 million. Transfers in to the University of Wisconsin System totaled $ 1.3 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 . The general purpose revenue supplement received from the State's General Fund was $998.2 million an increase of $36.6 million. The Capital Improvement Fund also transferred $191.3 million of bond and note proceeds to the University of Wisconsin System, an increase of $2.7 million from the prior year. Bond proceeds transferred in are a function of on-going capital projects funded with those bonds. Capital contributions decreased $36.5 million from the prior year to $18.7 million in Fiscal Year 2022 .State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 19GOVERNMENT-WIDE CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION Capital Assets At the close of Fiscal Year 2022 , the State reported $33.1 billion invested in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation of $9.6 billion. This represents an increase of $1.0 billion , or 3.2 percent, from Fiscal Year 2021 . Depreciation and amortization charges totaled $202.9 million and $414.3 million for governmental and business-type activities, respectively, in Fiscal Year 2022 .

The total general obligation debt outstanding for the State as of June 30, 2022 was $7.5 billion, as shown in Table 8. During Fiscal Year 2022 , $1.0 billion of general obligation bonds were issued to provide for the acquisition or improvement of land, water, property, highways, buildings, equipment, or facilities for public purposes or to refund outstanding bonds. Of the bonds issued in the current year, $378.2 million were to be used for University of Wisconsin System academic and self-amortizing facilities, $315.1 million for transportation projects, $78.5 million for environmental programs, and $29.6 million for correctional and mental health facilities. The remaining proceeds from new bonds issued were used for various other projects. In 1992 the State established a facility to provide lease purchase financing to state agencies (Master Lease). Lease purchase obligations under the Master Lease are not general obligations of the State but are payable from appropriations of participating state agencies, subject to annual appropriation. The trustee for the facility issues Master Lease certificates of participation that evidence proportionate interest of the owners thereof in lease payments. As of June 30, 2022 , $67.7 million of these certificates were outstanding. In Fiscal Year 2004, the State issued $1.8 billion of annual appropriation bonds to pay the State's unfunded accrued prior service (pension) liability and its unfunded accrued liability for sick leave conversion credits. In Fiscal Year 2009, the State issued $1.5 billion of annual appropriation bonds to purchase the future right, title, and interest in the Tobacco Settlement Revenues (TSRs) from Badger Tobacco Asset Securitization Corporation (BTASC). As of June 30, 2022 , $2.7 billion of these bonds were outstanding. Chapter 18 of the Wisconsin Statutes authorizes the State to issue revenue obligations. These obligations, which are not general obligation debt of the State, are secured by a pledge of revenues or property derived from the operations of a program funded by the issuance of the obligations. Revenue bonds of the primary government totaled $2.3 billion outstanding at June 30, 2022 , as shown in Table 8. These bonds included $1.9 billion of Transportation Revenue Bonds, and $398.6 million of Environmental Improvement Revenue Bonds.

Stat. Sec. 18.05 limit the amount of general obligation bond debt the State can contract in total and in any calendar year. In total, debt cannot exceed five percent of the value of all taxable property in the State. The amount of debt contracted in any calendar year is limited to the lesser of three-quarters of one percent of the aggregate value of taxable property or five percent of the aggregate value of taxable property less net indebtedness at January 1. At June 30, 2022 , State of Wisconsin general obligation fixed rate bonds had a rating of AA+ from Fitch Ratings, AAA from Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Aa1 from Moody's Investors Services, and AA+ from Standard and Poor's Rating Services. General obligation variable rate notes are outstanding in different forms, with ratings from two or more rating agencies. Detailed information about the State's long-term debt activity is presented in Note 11 to the financial statements.State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 21INFRASTRUCTURE - MODIFIED APPROACH The State reports infrastructure (i.e., roads, bridges, and buildings considered an ancillary part of roads) as capital assets. Infrastructure assets exclude right-of-way costs. The State has elected to report its infrastructure assets (11,200 centerline miles of roads and 5,100 bridges with a combined value of $19.4 billion) using the modified approach. Under this method, infrastructure assets are not required to be depreciated if the State manages its eligible infrastructure assets using an asset management system designed to maintain and preserve these assets at a condition level established and disclosed by the State. All infrastructure assets constructed prior to July 1, 2000 have been recorded at estimated historical cost. Historical cost was determined by calculating current costs of a similar asset and deflating that cost, using the Federal Highway Administration's composite index for federal-aid highway construction, to the estimated average construction date. All infrastructure assets constructed on or after July 1, 2000 have been recorded at historical cost. In order to adequately serve the traveling public and support the State economy, it is the State's policy to ensure at least 85 percent of the state-owned roads and bridges are in good or fair condition. As of June 30, 2022 , 92.2 percent of the roads and 97.5 percent of bridges were in good or fair condition, consistent with State policies. This compares to 92.5 percent of the roads and 97.7 percent of bridges as of June 30, 2021 . For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 , actual maintenance and preservation costs for the State's road network were $688.9 million, or $576.3 million less than the estimated amount. On the same date, actual maintenance and preservation costs for the State's bridge network were $58.6 million, or $0.6 million more than the estimated amount. In developing estimated costs at the beginning of the fiscal year, it is difficult to predict the types of projects that will actually incur costs during the year. In addition, the State of Wisconsin, Department of Transportation's multi-year contracting process, allowing encumbrances to carry forward, makes a comparison of actual to estimate amounts difficult since expenditures for the current year may have been budgeted and committed to a project in prior years. ECONOMIC FACTORS During calendar year 2021, the Wisconsin economy recovered strongly from the COVID-19 global pandemic with solid growth throughout the year. Wisconsin employment grew rapidly in 2021 after steep declines in employment in 2020 as a result of the pandemic's economic effects. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm employment in Wisconsin increased 0.3 percent in 2019, fell 5.5 percent in 2020, and rose 2.1 percent during 2021. Nationally, employment increased 1.3 percent in 2019, fell 5.8 percent in 2020, and rose 2.8 percent during 2021. Wisconsin employment growth had been constrained before the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic due to slower population growth and already high labor force participation, limiting room for growth. More recently, employment has recovered substantially with the overall national economic recovery. Since the trough in employment in April 2020, national employment is up 15.7 percent and Wisconsin employment is up 13.9 percent through September 2022. Relative to prepandemic February 2020 levels, Wisconsin employment is down 1.5 percent while employment nationally is up 0.3 percent. Wisconsin's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in September 2022 was 3.2 percent, below the 3.5 percent national unemployment rate for the same month. Wisconsin gross state product bounced back along with the overall national recovery in 2021, posting growth of 8.2 percent compared to 10.7 percent growth nationally. In 2020, Wisconsin gross state product declined by 1.3 percent compared to 1.5 percent nationally. Prior to the pandemic, Wisconsin grew 3.8 percent in 2019 compared to 4.1 percent nationally. Personal income growth followed the trajectory of overall economic growth, with a recovery in wages supplanting large transfer payments as the driver of growth. Wisconsin personal income grew by 6.7 percent in 2021 compared to 7.5 percent nationally. In 2019 and 2020, Wisconsin personal income grew 4.3 percent and 6.0 percent, similar to the national growth rates of 5.1 percent and 6.7 percent. On a per capita basis, Wisconsin's income performance is similar to the nation's. Per capita income in Wisconsin increased by 3.9 percent, 5.8 percent and 6.6 percent in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. This compares to growth of 4.6 percent, 6.2 percent and 7.3 percent in the same years nationally. Relative to the national average, Wisconsin per capita income has remained in approximately the same range for the past three years at 94.0 percent, 93.6 percent and 93.0 percent of the national average in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Wisconsin's statewide total property value increased again in 2022 for the ninth straight year following five years of declines from 2009 through 2013. The increase in values has been broad-based, reflecting improvements in all major sectors.

Notes To The Financial Statements 47NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A.Basis of Presentation The accompanying basic financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for governments as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). B.Financial Reporting Entity For GAAP purposes, the State of Wisconsin includes all funds, elected offices, departments and agencies of the State, as well as boards, commissions, authorities and universities. The State has also considered all potential \"component units\" for which it is financially accountable, and other affiliated organizations for which the nature and significance of their relationship, including their ongoing financial support, with the State are such that exclusion would cause the State's financial statements to be misleading or incomplete. The decision to include a potential component unit in the State's reporting entity is based on the criteria set forth in GASB Statement No. 14, The Financial Reporting Entity, GASB Statement No. 39, Determining Whether Certain Organizations Are Component Units, an amendment of GASB Statement No. 14, and GASB Statement No. 61, The Financial Reporting Entity: Omnibus, an amendment of GASB Statements No. 14 and No. 34. GASB Statement No. 14 criteria include the ability to appoint a voting majority of an organization's governing body and (1) the ability of the State to impose its will on that organization or (2) the potential for the organization to provide specific financial benefits to, or impose specific financial burdens on, the State. GASB Statement No. 39 provisions relate to separately legal, tax-exempt organizations and include: (1) the economic resources received or held are entirely or almost entirely for the direct benefit of the State, (2) the State is entitled to, or has the ability to otherwise access, a majority of the economic resources received or held by the separate organization, and (3) the economic resources received or held by an individual organization that the State is entitled to, or has the ability to otherwise access, are significant to the State. GASB Statement No. 61 modifies certain requirements for inclusion in the financial reporting entity, especially in regard to the fiscal dependency criterion where a financial benefit or burden relationship is now required. It also amends the \"blending\" criteria for component units and clarifies the reporting of equity interests in legally separate organizations.Based upon the application of the criteria contained in GASB Statement No. 14, as amended by GASB Statement No. 39, the Wisconsin Public Broadcasting Foundation, Inc. is reported as a blended component unit; and the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority, the Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan, the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation and the University of Wisconsin Foundation, are presented as discrete component units, as discussed below. Complete financial statements of the individual component units that issue separate statements can be obtained from their respective administrative offices: Wisconsin Public Broadcasting Foundation Inc. Wisconsin Educational Communications Board 3319 West Beltline Highway Madison, WI 53713 http://www.ecb.org Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority 908 East Main Street, Suite 501 Madison, WI 53703 http://www.wheda.com Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan Office of the Commissioner of Insurance 125 South Webster Street Madison, WI 53703 http://oci.wi.gov University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority 301 South Westfield Road Madison, WI 53717 http://www.uwhealth.org Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation 201 West Washington Avenue Madison, Wisconsin 53703 http://www.wedc.org University of Wisconsin Foundation 1848 University Avenue Madison, WI 53726-4090 https:// www.supportuw.orgState of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 48Blended Component Unit Blended component units are entities that are legally separate from the State but are so intertwined with the State that they are, in substance, the same as the State. The blended component unit serves or benefits the primary government. They are reported as part of the State and blended into the appropriate funds. Wisconsin Public Broadcasting Foundation, Inc. - The Wisconsin Public Broadcasting Foundation, Inc. (Foundation), created in 1983 by the Wisconsin Legislature, is a private, non-stock, nonprofit Wisconsin Corporation, wholly owned by the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board (ECB), a unit of the State. The Foundation solicits funds in the name of, and with the approval of, the ECB. The Foundation's funds are managed by a five-member board of trustees consisting of the executive director of the ECB and four members of the ECB board. The Foundation is reported as a special revenue fund. Discretely Presented Component Units Discretely presented component units are entities which are legally separate from the State, but are financially accountable to the State, whose relationship with the State is such that exclusion would cause the State's financial statements to be misleading or incomplete. The Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority, the Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan, the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation and the University of Wisconsin Foundation are reported in a separate column and in separate rows in the government-wide statements to emphasize that they are legally separate. Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority - The Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (Authority) was established by the Wisconsin Legislature in 1972 to help meet the housing needs of Wisconsin's low and moderate income citizens. The State has significantly expanded the scope of services of the Authority by adding programs that include financing for farmers and for economic development projects. While the Authority receives no State tax dollars for its bond- supported programs and the State is not liable on bonds the Authority issues, the State has the ability to impose its will on the Authority through legislation. The State appoints the Authority's Board. The Authority reports on a June 30 fiscal year-end. Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan - The Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan (Plan) was established by rule of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to provide health care liability insurance and liability coverage normally incidental to health care liability insurance to eligible health care providers in the State. Eight out of 13 members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Governor, and the State has the ability to impose its will upon the Plan. The Plan reports on a fiscal year ended December 31.University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority - The University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority (Hospital) is a not-for-profit academic medical center. The Hospital provides comprehensive health care to patients, education programs, research and community service. Prior to June 1996, the Hospital was a unit of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In June 1996, in accordance with legislation enacted by the State Legislature, the Hospital was restructured as a Public Authority, a public body corporate and politic created by State statutes. The State appoints a majority of the Hospital's Board of Directors and a financial benefit/burden relationship exists between the Hospital and the State. The Hospital reports on a June 30 fiscal year-end. The legislation that created the Hospital Authority also provided, among other things, for the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System to execute various agreements with the Hospital. These agreements include an Affiliation Agreement, a Lease Agreement, a Conveyance Agreement and a Contractual Services Agreement and Operating and Service Agreement. The Affiliation Agreement requires the Hospital to continue to support the educational, research and clinical activities of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which are administered by the Hospital. Under the terms of a Lease Agreement, the Hospital leases facilities which were occupied by the Hospital as of June 29, 1996. Under a Conveyance Agreement, certain assets and liabilities related to the Hospital were identified and transferred to the Hospital effective July 1, 1996. Subject to the Contractual Services Agreement and Operating and Service Agreement between the Board of Regents and the Hospital, the two parties have entered into contracts for the continuation of services in support of programs and operations. Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation - The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) is a legally separate body corporate and politic. The WEDC's primary purpose is economic development activities in the State. The State appoints a majority of the WEDC's Board, has the ability to impose its will on the WEDC, and a financial benefit/burden relationship exists. The WEDC reports on a fiscal year ended June 30. University of Wisconsin Foundation - The University of Wisconsin Foundation (the Foundation) is a legally separate, tax-exempt component unit of the State. The Foundation acts primarily as a fund-raising organization to supplement the resources that are available mostly to the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW- Madison) as well as several other units of the University of Wisconsin System in support of its programs. These include scientific, literary, athletic and educational program purposes. The University of Wisconsin System is reported as an enterprise fund of the State. Although the State does not control the timing or amount of receipts from the Foundation, the majority of resources, or income thereon, that the Foundation holds and invests, are restricted to the activities of the UW-Madison by the donors. Because these restricted resources held by the Foundation can only be used by, or for the benefit of, the UW-Madison and several State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 49other units of the University of Wisconsin System, the Foundation is considered a component unit of the State. The Foundation reports on a fiscal year ended June 30. Related Organizations These related organizations are excluded from the reporting entity because the State's accountability does not extend beyond appointing a voting majority of the organization's board members. Financial statements are available from the respective organizations. Wisconsin Health and Educational Facilities Authority - a public body politic and corporate that provides financing for capital expenditures and refinancing of indebtedness for Wisconsin health care and educational institutions. Fox River Navigational System Authority - created under Chapter 237 as a public body corporate and politic to oversee the Fox River navigational system after the federal government (the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) transferred the system to the State. C.Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements The government-wide financial statements consist of the statement of net position and the statement of activities. These statements report information on all activities, except for fiduciary activities, of the primary government and its component units. The statement of net position and the statement of activities distinguish between the governmental and business-type activities of the State. Governmental activities are generally financed through taxes, intergovernmental revenues and other nonexchange revenues. Business-type activities are generally financed in whole or in part by fees charged to external parties for goods and services. The focus of the government-wide statements is the primary government. A separate column on the statement of net position and the statement of activities reports activities for all discretely presented component units. The fund financial statements provide detailed information on all governmental, proprietary and fiduciary funds. Separate columns are presented for all major governmental and enterprise funds. Nonmajor governmental and enterprise funds are aggregated and presented as a single column on the respective governmental or proprietary statements. Internal service funds are exempt from the major fund reporting requirements and are aggregated and ultimately reported as a single column on the proprietary statements. Fiduciary funds are also exempt from major fund reporting and are aggregated by fund type and ultimately reported as single columns on the fiduciary statements.D.Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation The government-wide statement of net position and statement of activities, as well as the proprietary and fiduciary fund statements, are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. With this measurement focus, all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources associated with the operation of these funds are included on the statement of net position. Under the accrual basis, revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when the related liability is incurred. In the University of Wisconsin System's enterprise fund, revenues and expenses of an academic term that spans two fiscal years are recognized in two years based on a proration of summer session days. In reporting the financial activity of its enterprise funds and business-type activities, the State applies all applicable GASB pronouncements. Most of the funds included in the State's Annual Comprehensive Financial Report are presented on a fiscal year ended June 30. However, because funds of the Department of Employee Trust Funds (DETF) are administered on a calendar year basis, they are presented on a fiscal year ended December 31. This may result in GASB standards being implemented in different fiscal years for the DETF GAAP funds. Funds reported as of December 31 include: Wisconsin Retirement System, Accumulated Sick Leave Conversion Credit, Supplemental Health Insurance Conversion Credit, Wisconsin Deferred Compensation, Duty Disability, Reimbursed Employee Expense, Local Retiree Life Insurance, Retiree Life Insurance, Milwaukee Retirement System, Retiree Health Insurance, Local Retiree Health Insurance, Income Continuation Insurance, and Health Insurance. As a result of the differences in timing, transactions between funds with different fiscal year ends may result in inconsistencies in amounts reported as due to/due from other funds or as interfund transfers. Similar differences may occur in amounts reported as due to/from component units. The University of Wisconsin Foundation and Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan are reported as component units. The Foundation financial statements are prepared using accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board as they apply to not-for-profit corporations. The Plan financial statements are prepared using prescribed statutory accounting practices included in the National Association of Insurance Commissioner's Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. Statutory accounting practices vary somewhat from United States GAAP, but differences are expected to be immaterial.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 50Governmental fund financial statements are accounted for using the current financial resources measurement focus. With this measurement focus, only current assets and current liabilities generally are included on the balance sheet. Operating statements of these funds present increases (i.e., revenues and other financing sources) and decreases (i.e., expenditures and other financing uses) in net available financial resources. Governmental funds are reported on the modified accrual basis of accounting. This basis of accounting recognizes revenues generally when they become measurable and available to pay current reporting period liabilities. For this purpose, the State considers tax revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal year end. Other revenues are considered to be available if received within one year after the fiscal year end except for tobacco settlement revenues for which just one-half of revenues expected to be received within one year are recognized. Material revenue sources susceptible to accrual include individual and corporate income taxes, sales taxes, public utility taxes, motor fuel taxes and federal revenues. Expenditures and related liabilities are recognized when obligations are incurred as a result of the receipt of goods and services. However, expenditures related to debt service, compensated absences, and claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due. The State reports the following major funds: Major Governmental Funds General Fund - the primary operating fund of the State, accounts for all financial transactions except those required to be accounted for in another fund. Transportation Fund - a special revenue fund, accounts for the proceeds from motor fuel taxes, vehicle registrations, licensing fees, and federal and local governments which are used to supply and support safe, efficient and effective transportation in Wisconsin.Major Enterprise Funds Environmental Improvement Fund - accounts for financial resources generated and used for clean water projects. Federal capitalization grants, interest earnings, revenue bond proceeds, and general obligation bond proceeds are its primary funding sources. University of Wisconsin System Fund - accounts for the 13 four-year universities, 13 additional campuses affiliated with seven of the four-year institutions, and System Administration. Unemployment Reserve Fund - accounts for unemployment contributions made by employers, federal program receipts, benefit payment recoveries and unemployment benefits paid to laid off workers in the State. In addition, the State reports the following fund types: Governmental Funds Special Revenue Funds - account for and report the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specified purposes other than debt service or capital projects. Examples include the Conservation Fund and the Petroleum Inspection Fund. Debt Service Funds - account for and report financial resources that are restricted, committed, or assigned to expenditure for principal and interest. Financial resources that are being accumulated for future principal and interest are also reported in debt service funds. Capital Projects Funds - account for and report financial resources that are restricted, committed or assigned to expenditure for capital outlays, including the acquisition or construction of capital facilities and other capital assets (other than those financed by proprietary funds or that will be held in trust for individuals, private organizations, or other governments). Permanent Funds - account for and report resources that are restricted to the extent that only earnings, and not principal, may be used for purposes that support the State's programs - that is, for the benefit of the State or its citizenry.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 51Proprietary Funds Enterprise Funds - account for the activities for which fees are charged to external users for goods or services. Examples include the Lottery Fund and the Veterans Trust Fund. Internal Service Funds - account for the operations of State agencies which provide goods or services to other State units or other governments on a cost-reimbursement basis. These services include technology, fleet management, financial, facilities management, risk management, human resource services and accumulated sick leave. Additional goods and services are provided by the inmate work experience program, Badger State Industries. Fiduciary Funds Pension and Other Employee Benefit Trust Fund s - used to account for resources that are required to be held in trust for members and beneficiaries for public employee retirement or other benefit plans e.g. Wisconsin Retirement System. Investment Trust Funds - account for assets invested on a commingled basis by the State on behalf of other governmental entities e.g. local government pooled investments. Private-purpose Trust Funds - account for all other trust arrangements which benefit individuals, private organizations, or other governments e.g. the state-sponsored college savings program. Custodial Funds - account for those assets for which the State acts solely in a custodial capacity e.g. the collection and disbursement of court-ordered child support payments. Amounts reported as program revenues on the government-wide statement of activities include (a) charges for services - amounts received from customers or applicants who purchase, use or directly benefit from the goods, services or privileges provided by the State; including interest earnings from various loan funds/ component units, (b) program-specific operating grants, contributions, and restricted interest, and (c) program-specific capital grants, contributions, and restricted interest. General revenues consist of taxes and all other revenues that do not meet the definition of program revenues. Special items, if any, are significant transactions or events within the control of management that are either unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence. As a general rule, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide financial statements. This includes all internal service fund activity, as well as other internal allocations. Exceptions to this general rule are certain charges between various functions of the government, whose elimination would distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the various functions concerned.The revenues and expenses shown on the proprietary fund statements are identified as either operating or nonoperating. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing goods and services in connection with a proprietary fund's primary mission. The State's enterprise funds are involved in many diverse fields including patient care, insurance programs, loan programs, the University of Wisconsin System, employee benefit plans, and the lottery. The internal service funds provide services and goods to other State agencies and departments. A significant portion of operating revenues for the proprietary funds is recorded under charges for goods and services. In the case of the State's loan program enterprise funds, investment and interest income is an important component of operating revenue. Operating revenues of the University of Wisconsin include tuition and fees, certain grants and contracts resulting from exchange transactions, and sales and services of educational activities and auxiliary enterprises. In regards to the employee benefit plans, the primary operating revenue source is participant and employer contributions. Operating expenses for the proprietary funds include the costs of sales and services, benefit expenses, administration expenses and depreciation on capital assets. All revenues and expenses not related to a fund's primary purpose are reported as nonoperating. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the State's policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed. GASB Standards Implemented During the Fiscal Year Effective for Fiscal Year 2022 , the State implemented the following new standards issued by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). GASB Statement No. 87, Leases, establishes a single model for lease accounting based on the principle that leases are financings of the right to use an underlying asset. GASB Statement No. 92, Omnibus 2020 , addresses practice issues that were identified during the implementation of certain GASB standards. The standard addresses a variety of topics including leases, intra-entity transfers, pensions, fiduciary activities, asset retirement obligations, public entity risk pools, fair value measurements and derivative instruments. GASB Statement No. 93, Replacement of Interbank Offered Rates, addresses the accounting and financial reporting implications that result from the replacement of an interbank offered rate. GASB Statement No. 98, The Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, established the term annual comprehensive financial report and the acronym ACFR. GASB Statement No. 99, Omnibus 2022, paragraphs 26-32 relating to the replacement of LIBOR, SNAP benefits, disclosure of nonmonetary transactions, pledges of future revenues when State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 52resources are not received by the pledging government and terminology updates. E.Assets, Deferred Outflows of Resources, Liabilities, Deferred Inflows of Resources, and Net Position/Fund Balances 1. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash balances of most funds are deposited with the Department of Administration (DOA) where the available balances beyond immediate needs are pooled in the State Investment Fund for short-term investment purposes. Balances pooled are restricted to legally stipulated investments valued consistent with GASB Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement and Application . Cash balances not controlled by DOA may be invested where permitted by statute. Cash and cash equivalents, reported on the balance sheet and statement of cash flows, include bank accounts, petty cash, cash in transit, short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less such as certificates of deposit, money market certificates, repurchase agreements and individual funds' shares in the State Investment Fund. GASB Statement No. 40, Deposit and Investment Risk Disclosures , requires disclosure of risks associated with deposit and investment balances and the policies applied to mitigate such risks. Specific disclosures are included in Note 5, Deposits and Investments. 2. Investments The State may invest in direct obligations of the United States and Canada, securities guaranteed by the United States, certificates of deposit issued by banks in the United States and solvent financial institutions in the State, commercial paper and nonsecured corporate notes and bonds, banker's acceptances, participation agreements, privately placed bonds and mortgages, common and preferred stock and other securities approved by applicable sections of the Wisconsin Statutes, bond resolutions, and various trust indentures (see Note 5 to the financial statements). Investments of the primary government are reported at fair value consistent with the provisions of GASB Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement and Application . Typically, fair value information is determined using quoted market prices. However, when quoted market prices are not available for certain securities, fair values are estimated through techniques such as discounted future cash flows, matrix pricing and multi-tiers. In some instances, securities are reported at cost. Certain non- public or closely held stocks are carried at cost since no independent quotation is available to price these securities. Further, certain investment agreements are reported on a cost basis because the State cannot readily determine whether these agreements meet the definition of interest-earning investment contracts as defined by GASB Statement No. 31. However, the impact on the financial statements is immaterial.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 53Under Wisconsin Statutes, the investment earnings of certain Permanent Funds are assigned to other funds. The following table shows the funds earning the investment income and the ultimate recipients of that income: Fund Generating Investment IncomeFund Receiving Investment Income Agricultural College University of Wisconsin System Normal School General Fund and University of Wisconsin System University University of Wisconsin System 3. Mortgage and Other Loans Mortgage loans of the Veterans Trust Fund program, a business- type activity, are stated at the outstanding loan balance less an allowance for doubtful accounts. 4. Forestation State Tax 2017 Wis. Act 59 (the Budget Act) ended the forestry mill tax, the only property tax that had been levied by the State. The proceeds of the tax had been paid to the Conservation Fund. The tax ended effective with the January 1, 2017 property tax assessments (property taxes levied in 2017 for payment in 2018). 5. Interfund Assets/Liabilities During the course of operations, numerous transactions occur between individual funds for goods provided or services rendered. The balance sheet or statement of net position for proprietary and fiduciary funds classifies these receivables and payables as \"Due from Other Funds\" or \"Due to Receivables\" Payables.\" Long-term interfund loans are classified \"Advances to Other Funds\" and \"Advances from Other Funds\". Balances that exist between the primary government and component units are classified as \"Due to/from Primary Government\" and, correspondingly, \"Due to/from Component Units\". Amounts reported in the funds as interfund assets/liabilities are eliminated in the governmental and business-type columns of the Statement of Net Position, except for the net residual amount due between governmental and business-type activities which is shown as internal balances.6. Inventories and Prepaid Items Inventories of governmental and proprietary funds are valued at cost, which approximates market, using the first-in/first-out, last in/ first out, or weighted-average method. The costs of governmental fund-type inventories are recorded as expenditures when purchased rather than when consumed. Inventories of the University of Wisconsin System held by central stores are valued at average cost, fuels are valued at market, and other inventories held by individual institutional cost centers are valued using a variety of cost flow assumptions that, for each type of inventory, are consistently applied from year to year. Prepaid items reflect payments for costs applicable to future accounting periods. The fund balances of governmental funds are reported as nonspendable for inventories and prepaid items, except in cases where prepaid items are offset by unearned revenues, to indicate that these accounts do not represent expendable available financial resources. 7. Capital Assets Capital assets, which include property, plant, equipment, intangibles, land, library holdings, and infrastructure assets (roads, bridges, and buildings considered an ancillary part of roads), are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. Assets of the primary government, other than infrastructure and land purchased for the construction of infrastructure assets, are capitalized when they have a unit cost of $5,000 or more (except for a collection of library resources that must have a cumulative value equal to or greater than $5.0 million and software purchased by the University of Wisconsin System) and a useful life of more than one year. In addition, internally generated intangible assets are capitalized only if costs are equal to or are greater than $1.0 million. Purchased or constructed capital assets are valued at cost or estimated historical cost if actual historical cost is not practicably determinable. Donated capital assets are recorded at their acquisition value at the time received. The State has elected to report infrastructure assets (roads, bridges and buildings considered an ancillary part of roads) using the modified approach. Under this method infrastructure assets are not required to be depreciated if the State manages its eligible infrastructure assets using an asset management system designed to maintain and preserve its infrastructure assets at a condition level established and disclosed by the State. All infrastructure assets constructed prior to July 1, 2000 have been recorded at estimated historical cost which was determined by calculating the current cost of a similar asset and deflating that cost using Federal Highway Administration's composite index for State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 54federal aid highway construction to the estimated average construction date. All infrastructure assets constructed after July 1, 2000 have been recorded at historical cost. The costs of maintenance and preservation that do not add to the asset's capacity or efficiency are not capitalized. Interest incurred during construction is not capitalized. Exhaustible capital assets of the primary government generally are depreciated on the straight-line method over the asset's useful life. Select buildings of the University of Wisconsin System are depreciated using the componentized method over the estimated useful life of the related assets. Depreciation expense is recorded in the government-wide financial statements, as well as in the proprietary fund statements. There is no depreciation recorded for land, construction in process, and infrastructure. In addition, depreciation is not recorded for certain other capital assets including the State Capitol, Executive Residence and associated furnishings, and the Historical Society library collection. Generally, estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings and improvements 6 - 40 years Equipment, machinery and furnishings 3 - 15 years Library Holdings 15 years Collections of works of art, historical treasures, and similar assets, which are on public display, used in furtherance of historical education, or involved in advancement of artistic or historical research, are not capitalized unless these collections were already capitalized at June 30, 1999. Collections range from memorabilia on display in the Wisconsin Veterans Museum, the Wisconsin Historical Society Museum and other museums to buildings such as the Villa Louis Mansion and the Fur Trade Museum located at the Villa Louis historical site. In addition, works of art or historical treasures on display in the various State office buildings, as well as statues on display outside the State Capitol, also are not capitalized. 8. Restricted and Limited Use Assets Assets that are required to be held and/or used as specified in Wisconsin statutes, bond indentures, bond resolutions, trustee agreements, board resolutions, and donor specifications have been reported as Restricted and Limited Use Assets. 9. Local Assistance Aids Municipal and County Shared Revenue Program Through the Municipal and County Shared Revenue Program, the State distributes general revenues collected from general State tax sources to municipal and county governments to be used for providing local government services. State statutes require that payment to local governments be made during July and November.The State was liable to various local governments for unpaid shared revenue aid. To measure the amount of the program allocable to the State's fiscal year, the amount is prorated over portions of recipient local governments' calendar fiscal years that are within the State's fiscal year. The result is that a liability of $448.9 million representing one-half of the total appropriated amount is reported at June 30, 2022 as Due to Other Governments. State Property Tax Credit Program The State was liable to various taxing jurisdictions for the school levy, the first dollar, and the lottery property tax credits paid through the State Property Tax Credit Program. The school levy tax credit provides property tax relief in the form of State credits on individual property tax bills. The first dollar tax credit was first established for property taxes levied in 2008, and payable in 2009. This credit is allowed on every taxable real estate parcel containing an improvement in the state. Under the lottery property tax credit, owners of property used as a primary residence receive a tax credit equal to the school property tax on a portion of the dwelling's value. State statutes require that payment to local taxing jurisdictions for the school levy and first dollar tax credits be made during July. Although the state property tax credit is calculated on the property tax levy for school purposes, the State's July payment is paid to an administering municipality who treats the payment the same as other tax collections and distributes the collections to the various tax levying jurisdictions (e.g., cities, towns, and school districts). The portion of the liability payable to school districts for the school levy and first dollar tax credits represents the amount of the July payment earned over the school districts' previous fiscal year ended June 30. Since the entire school districts' portion of the July payment occurs within the State's fiscal year, 100 percent of the July payment relating to the school taxing jurisdictions' levy is reported as a liability at June 30, 2022. The portion of the liability payable to general government for the school levy and first dollar tax credits represents the amount of the July payment prorated over the portion of the local governments' calendar year which is within the State's fiscal year. The result is that 50 percent of the July payment based on the general government taxing jurisdictions' levy is reported as a liability at June 30, 2022. The aggregated State Property Tax Credit Program liability of $804.9 million is reported in the General Fund as Due to Other Governments. Of that amount, $695.9 million relates to the school levy tax credit and $109.0 million relates to the first dollar tax credit.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 55The lottery property tax credit is accounted for in the Lottery Fund, an enterprise fund that records revenues and expenses on the accrual basis. The State pays municipal treasurers for lottery credits who distribute the moneys to the various taxing jurisdictions. For credits reducing the calendar year 2022 property tax bills, the State made this payment in March 2022 . A portion of the State's March payment distributed to the general government taxing jurisdictions applies to their fiscal year that ends on December 31. Therefore, part of the March distribution represents an expense of the State in Fiscal Year 2022 , while the remaining portion represents advanced payments. The resulting deferred outflow of resources reported within the Lottery Fund totals $88.3 million at June 30, 2022 . State Aid for Exempt Computers The Aid for Exempt Computers compensates local governments for tax base lost due to the property tax exemption for computers, software and related equipment. Aid payments are calculated using a procedure that results in an aid amount equal to the amount of taxes that would be paid if the property were taxable. Payments to local governments are made on the fourth Monday in July. At June 30, 2022, the State was liable to various local governments and other taxing jurisdictions for unpaid exempt computer aid payments of $67.4 million. State Aid for Exempt Personal Property 2017 Wis. Act 59 (the Budget Act) exempted machinery, tools, and patterns, not including such items considered manufacturing property under current law, from the property tax effective with property assessed as of January 1, 2018 (the 2018(19) property tax levy). The Act also created a state aid program administered by DOR to make payments to each local taxing jurisdiction, including tax increment districts, that imposed property taxes on those items that were not manufacturing property in 2017(18). Upon certification by DOR, payments will be made to local taxing jurisdictions on or before the first Monday in May. Under the Act, aid payments totaling $78.2 million were made in May 2022. State Aid for Video Service Provider Fee 2019 Wis. Act 9 (the Budget Act) reduced the fee rate municipalities can charge cable and phone companies. This state aid to municipalities replaces the lost revenue related to the fee reduction. Payments to local governments are made on the fourth Monday in July. At June 30, 2022, the State was liable to various local governments and other taxing jurisdictions for unpaid aid for video service fees of $5.0 million.10. Long-term Debt Obligations In the government-wide financial statements, and proprietary fund types in the fund financial statements, long-term debt is reported as a liability net of the applicable bond premium or discount. Bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method on a prospective basis beginning in Fiscal Year 2004, except for the annual appropriation bonds that are amortized ratably over the life of the obligations to which they relate. In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize flows for bond premiums and discounts, as well as issuance costs, during the current period. The face amount of the debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums and discounts are reported as other financing sources and other financing uses, respectively. Issuance costs are reported as other debt service expenditures for governmental fund types, and non- operating expenses for proprietary fund types. On the government-wide financial statements, bond premiums and discounts related to the Transportation Revenue Bonds, which finance programs in a capital projects fund, are amortized ratably over the life of the obligations to which they relate. Results from the use of this method do not vary materially from those that would be obtained by use of the effective interest rate method. 11. Compensated Absences Consistent with the compensated absences reporting standards of GASB Statement No. 16, Accounting for Compensated Absences , an accrual for certain salary-related payments associated with annual leave and an accrual for a certain portion of sick leave is included in the compensated absences liability at year end. Annual Leave Full-time employees' annual leave days are credited on January 1 of each calendar year in general at a minimum of 15 or 13 days per year, depending on Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) status. There is no requirement to use annual leave. However, unused leave is lost unless approval to carry over the unused portion is obtained from the employing agency. In general, each full-time employee is eligible for four and one-half personal holidays each calendar year, provided the employee is in pay status for at least one day in the year. If a holiday occurs on a Saturday, employees receive leave time proportional to their working status to use at their discretion. The State's compensated absence liability at June 30 consists of accumulated unpaid annual leave, personal holiday hours, and Saturday/legal holiday hours earned and vested during January through June. The liability is reported in the government-wide, proprietary fund types and fiduciary funds.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 56Sick Leave Full-time employees earn sick leave at a rate of five hours per pay period. Unused sick leave is accumulated from year to year without limit until termination or retirement. Accumulated sick leave is not paid. However, at employee retirement the accumulated sick leave may be converted to pay for the retiree's health insurance premiums. The State accumulates resources to pay for the expected health insurance premiums of retired employees. The portion of the health insurance obligation funded through the sick leave conversion and accumulated resources are presented as two funds. The basic component of sick leave is presented as an internal service fund and the supplementary component of sick leave is presented as a pension and other employee benefit trust fund. 12. Unearned Revenue In both the government-wide and fund financial statements unearned revenue represents amounts for which asset recognition criteria have been met, but not revenue recognition criteria. Unearned revenue arises when resources are received by the State before it has a legal claim to them, such as when grant moneys are received prior to the incurrence of qualifying expenditures. In subsequent periods, when revenue recognition criteria are met, or when the State has a legal claim to the resources, the liability for unearned revenue is removed and revenue is recognized. Unearned revenue of the University of Wisconsin System consists of payments received but not earned at June 30, 2022 , primarily for summer session tuition, tuition and room deposits for the next fall term, advance ticket sales for upcoming intercollegiate athletic events, and amounts received from grant and contract sponsors that have not yet been earned under the terms of the agreement. 13. Self-Insurance Consistent with the requirements of GASB Statement No. 10, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Risk Financing and Related Insurance Issues , the State's risk management activities are reported in an internal service fund, and the claims liabilities associated with that fund are reported therein. The State's policy is generally not to purchase commercial insurance for the risk of losses to which it is exposed. Instead, State management believes it is more economical to manage its own risks internally. The Risk Management Fund, an internal service fund, is used to pay for losses incurred by any State agency and for administrative costs incurred to manage a state- wide risk management program. These losses include damage to property owned by the agencies, personal injury or property damage liabilities incurred by a State officer, agent or employee, and worker's compensation costs for State employees. A limited amount of insurance is purchased to limit the exposure to catastrophic losses. Annually, a charge is allocated to each agency for its proportionate share of the estimated cost attributable to the program per Wis. Stat. Sec. 16.865(8). 14. Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Deferred outflows of resources represent a consumption of net assets by the government that is applicable to a future reporting period. Deferred inflows of resources represent an acquisition of net assets by the government that is applicable to a future reporting period. The events associated with the outflows and inflows of resources have already occurred. Under GASB standards, however, the recognition of those outflows and inflows as expenses or expenditures and revenues are deferred until the future periods to which the outflows and inflows are applicable. GASB standards identify circumstances under which deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources must be reported. The reporting of deferred inflows and outflows are only allowable under those circumstances. As applicable, the State reports deferred outflows of resources or deferred inflows of resources in the Statement of Net Position for governmental activities and business-type activities and for proprietary and fiduciary fund types as follows: A decrease or increase in the fair value of derivative instruments classified as effective hedges is presented as a deferred outflow or deferred inflow of resources, respectively, with an off-setting liability or asset, as applicable. Gains on refunded debt (i.e. the reacquisition price is less than the net carrying amount of the old debt) are reported as deferred inflows, while losses on refunded debt (i.e. the reacquisition price is greater than the net carrying amount of the old debt) are reported as deferred outflows. Both are amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the old bonds or the life of the new bonds, whichever is shorter. Differences between expected and actual experience with regard to economic and demographic factors in the measurement of the pension and OPEB liabilities for the State's proportionate share are reported as deferred inflows or deferred outflows of resources. They are amortized using a systematic and rational method over a closed period equal to the average of the expected remaining service lives of all active and inactive employees provided with pensions or OPEBs through the applicable plans. Changes of assumptions about future economic or demographic factors, or of other inputs in the measurement of the pension or OPEB liabilities for the State's proportionate share, are reported as deferred inflows or deferred outflows of resources. They are amortized using a systematic and rational method over a closed period equal to the average of the expected remaining service lives of all active and inactive employees provided with pensions or OPEBs through the applicable plans.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 57Differences between projected and actual earnings on the State's proportionate share of pension or OPEB plan investments, if any, are reported as deferred inflows or deferred outflows of resources and amortized using a systematic and rational method over a closed five-year period. Changes in the State's proportionate share of the pension or OPEB liabilities since the prior measurement date, and differences between actual and proportionate share of contributions are reported as deferred inflows or deferred outflows of resources. They are amortized using a systematic and rational method over a closed period equal to the average expected remaining service lives of all active and inactive employees provided with pensions or OPEBs through the applicable plans. Contributions to the pension or OPEB plans from the State subsequent to the measurement date of the pension or OPEB liabilities and before the end of the State's fiscal year end are reported as deferred outflows of resources. State resources transmitted to an entity before time requirements are met, but after all other eligibility requirements have been met, are reported as a deferred outflow of resources. Federal or other entities' resources transmitted to the State before time requirements are met, but after all other eligibility requirements have been met, are reported as deferred inflows of resources. When asset retirement obligations (ARO) are recognized, a corresponding deferred outflow of resources is also recognized and reduced in a systematic and rational manner over the estimated useful life of the capital asset. Further, governmental fund types may report deferred inflows of resources for unavailable revenue, such as derived nonexchange revenue transactions (e.g. sales tax, income tax, assessments on earnings and consumption, etc.). These inflows are not deferred in the government-wide financial statements; rather, they are recognized as revenue. 15. Fund Balance Classification and Restricted Net Position Fund Balance Classification In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report fund balance classifications that comprise a hierarchy based primarily on the extent to which the state is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for which amounts in those funds can be spent. Fund balance is reported as restricted when constraints placed on the use of the resources are either externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments; or, imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.Amounts that may be used only for specific purposes, pursuant to constraints imposed by passage of a bill by both houses of the legislature that is signed into law by the governor, are reported as committed fund balance. Those committed amounts cannot be used for any other purpose unless a bill passes both houses of the legislature and is signed by the governor to remove or change the specified use. Passage of a bill by both houses of the legislature and signing of the bill by the governor is the highest level action that results in committed fund balance. Amounts that are constrained by the state's intent to be used for specific purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed, are classified as assigned fund balances. Intent is expressed by state officials to whom the state has delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific purposes. Unassigned fund balance represents fund balance that has not been restricted, committed, or assigned to specific purposes within the General Fund. Unassigned fund balance may also include negative balances for any governmental fund if expenditures exceed amounts restricted, committed, or assigned for those purposes. Nonspendable fund balances include amounts that cannot be spent because they are either not in spendable form or are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use it is the State's policy to use restricted resources first, and then unrestricted as they are needed. The state has not established a policy for use of unrestricted fund balance. Under the provisions of GASB Statement No. 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions , if a government does not establish a policy for its use of unrestricted fund balance amounts, committed amounts would be reduced first, followed by assigned amounts, and then unassigned amounts. Restricted Net Position Restricted Net Position, presented in the government-wide and proprietary funds statement of net position are reported when constraints placed on use are either (1) externally imposed by creditors (such as through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments, or (2) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. Enabling legislation authorizes the government to assess, levy, charge, or otherwise mandate payment of resources (from external resource providers) and includes a legally enforceable requirement that those resources be used only for the specific purposes stipulated in the legislation. Unrestricted net position may be used at the State's discretion but may have limitations on use based on State statutes.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 58 NOTE 2. DETAILED RECONCILIATION OF THE GOVERNMENT-WIDE AND FUND STATEMENTS A.Explanation of Differences Between the Balance Sheet - Governmental Funds and the Statement of Net Position During the year ended June 30, 2022 , the following adjustments and reclassifications were necessary to reconcile the information from the fund-based Balance Sheet - Governmental Funds to the amounts presented in the governmental activities section of the Statement of Net Position (in thousands). The differences result primarily from the long-term economic focus of the Statement of Net Position compared to the current financial focus of the Balance Sheet - Governmental Funds.

In contrast, the Statement of Net Position has a long-term economic focus and reports on all capital and financial resources. (2) The adjustment for internal service funds reflects the reclassification of these funds for the government-wide statement. The assets and liabilities of these funds are reported as proprietary activities on the fund statements, but are included as governmental activities on the Statement of Net Position. (3) Various reclassifications are necessary due to the differing level of detail needed on each of the statements. Eliminations are done on the Statement of Net Position to minimize the grossing-up effect on assets and liabilities within the governmental and business- type activities columns of the primary government. The net residual amounts due between governmental and business-type activities are shown as internal balances.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 60B.

Long-term expense differences arise because governmental funds report operating expenses (including interest) using the modified accrual basis of accounting, while government-wide statements report using the accrual basis of accounting. (2) Capital-related adjustments consist of the difference between proceeds for the sales of capital assets and the gain or loss from the sales of capital assets, and from the difference between capital outlay expenditures recorded in the governmental funds and depreciation expense recorded in the government- wide statements. (3) The adjustment for internal service funds reflects the elimination of these funds from the government-wide statement, which is accomplished by charging/ refunding additional amounts to participating governmental activities to completely offset the internal service funds' cost for the year.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 61Internal Service Funds (3)Long-term Debt Transactions (4) Eliminations (5)Revenue/Expense Reclassifications (6)Total Amount for Statement of Activities $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 12,902,644 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 7,827,191 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 378,193 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 382,523 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1,120,012 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 118,830 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (17,413,392) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 56,109 16,466,853 \u2014 (60,734) 12,097 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (22,905) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 464,799 464,800 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (124,521) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (339,373) \u2014 217,582 \u2014 104,114 906 43,683,111 (109) \u2014 \u2014 (132) 516,392 146,920 751 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 76,245 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1,591,184 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1,074,920 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (755,352) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 9,189 \u2014 (906,627) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (52,388) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 38,371 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 543,481 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (3,393) (377,163) \u2014 (906) (1,420,718) $ 210,839 $ 469,603 (9,558) 5,170,774 9,558 \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 5,170,774 (4) Long-term debt transaction differences consist of bond proceeds and principal repayments reported as other financing sources and expenditures in governmental funds, but as increases and decreases in liabilities in the government-wide statements. (5) Intra-entity activity within the same function is eliminated to remove the grossing up of both direct expenses and program revenues within that category. (6) Revenue and expense reclassifications are necessary due to the differing level of detail needed on each of the statements. In addition, the Statement of Activities focuses on program revenue, which has been redefined from the traditional revenue source categories.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 62NOTE 3. BUDGETARY CONTROL The legal level of budgetary control for Wisconsin is at the function, agency, program, appropriation-level. Supplemental appropriations require the approval of the Joint Finance Committee of the Legislature. Routine adjustments, such as pay plan supplements and rent increases, are distributed by the Division of Executive Budget and Finance from non-agency specific appropriations authorized by the Legislature. Various supplemental appropriations were approved during the year and have been incorporated into the budget figures. The budgetary comparison schedule and related disclosures for the General and Transportation funds are reported as Required Supplementary Information. This schedule presents the original budget, the final budget and actual data of the current period. The related disclosures describe the budgetary practices of the State, as well as, provide a detailed reconciliation between the General and Transportation funds' equity balance on the budgetary basis compared to the GAAP basis as shown on the governmental fund statements. NOTE 4. DEFICIT FUND BALANCE/FUND NET POSITION, RESTRICTED NET POSITION, BUDGET STABILIZATION ARRANGEMENT, MINIMUM FUND BALANCE POLICY, AND FUND BALANCE OF GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS A. Deficit Fund Balance/Fund Net Position Funds reporting a deficit fund balance or net position at June 30, 2022 are (in thousands): Special Revenue: Dry Cleaner Environmental Response $ 6,256 Capital Projects: Capital Improvement 15,362 Enterprise: Northern Developmental Disabilities Center 12,341 Internal Service: Accumulated Sick Leave Basic Plan 254,144 Fleet Services 1,995 Human Resource Services 6,340 Risk Management 128,470 B. Restricted Net Position GASB Statement No. 46, Net Assets Restricted by Enabling Legislation, which amends GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements - and Management's Discussion and Analysis - for State and Local Governments, provides guidance for determining when net assets have been restricted to a particular use by the passage of enabling legislation and how those net assets should be reported in financial statements when there are changes in the circumstances surrounding such legislation. Net position restricted by enabling legislation was as follows on June 30, 2022 (in thousands): Governmental Activities: Net Position Restricted by Enabling Legislation $ 1,284,122 Business-type Activities: Net Position Restricted by Enabling Legislation 2,070,873 C. Budget Stabilization Arrangement Wisconsin Statutes 25.60 establishes a stabilization arrangement for monies to be set aside for use if General Fund revenues are less than projected and expenditures exceed budgeted amounts. Wisconsin Statutes 16.518 provides for the automatic transfer of 50.0 percent of the excess of General Fund tax revenues over tax estimates to be deposited into a stabilization appropriation. However, the transfer may not be made if the stabilization balance is at least equal to 5.0 percent of estimated General Fund expenditures for the fiscal year. Further, the transfer may not reduce the General Fund balance below the required statutory balance. In addition to the transfer described, under Wisconsin Statutes 16.72(4) net proceeds from the sale of supplies, materials and equipment are also to be deposited into the stabilization appropriation except as otherwise provided by law. Wisconsin Statutes 16.50(7) provides that if the secretary of the Department of Administration determines that previously authorized expenditures under the biennial budget act will exceed revenues in the current or forthcoming fiscal year by more than one-half of one percent of the estimated general purpose revenue appropriations for that fiscal year, he or she shall immediately notify the governor, the presiding officers of each house of the legislature and the joint committee on finance. Following such notification, the governor shall submit a bill containing recommendations for correcting the imbalance between projected revenues and authorized expenditures, including a recommendation as to whether moneys should be transferred from the budget stabilization appropriation to the General Fund. The balance of the budget stabilization arrangement as of June 30, 2022 was $1.7 billion. There was no transfer to the budget stabilization fund in fiscal year 2022 since the current balance exceeded 5.0 percent of the estimated General Fund expenditures for the fiscal year. D. Minimum Fund Balance Wisconsin Statutes 20.003(4) establishes a minimum General Fund balance. Under the statutes, no bill directly or indirectly affecting general purpose revenues as defined in Wisconsin Statues 20.001(2)(a) may be enacted by the legislature if the bill would cause the estimated General Fund balance on June 30 of any fiscal year to be an amount equal to or less than the amount specified for that fiscal year. The minimum required balance for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022 was $90.0 million.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 63E.

DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS The State maintains a short-term investment \"pool\", the State Investment Fund, for the State, its agencies and departments, and certain other public institutions which elect to participate. The investment \"pool\" is managed by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (the Board) which is further authorized to carry out investment activities for certain enterprise, trust and custodial funds. A small number of State agencies also carry out investment activities separate from the Board. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board also issues separate financial reports for the investments they manage, including the State Investment Fund (SIF), and the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS). Copies of the separately issued financial reports may be obtained at www.swib.state.wi.us or by writing to: State of Wisconsin Investment Board P.O. Box 7842 Madison, WI 53707-7842 The Department of Employee Trust Funds issues separate financial reports for the State of Wisconsin Public Employees Deferred Compensation Plan and Trust (Deferred Compensation). Copies of the separately issued financial reports may be obtained at etf.wi.gov or by writing to: Department of Employee Trust Funds P.O. Box 7931 Madison, WI 53707-7931 A.Deposits Deposits include cash and cash equivalents on deposit in banks or other financial institutions, and nonnegotiable certificates of deposit. The majority of the State's deposits are under the control of the Department of Administration. The Department of Administration maintains multiple accounts with an agreement with the bank that allows an overdraft in one account if the overdraft is offset by balances in other accounts. Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the government's deposits may not be returned to it. The State's policy regarding custodial credit risk is detailed in Chapter 34 of the State Statutes. In brief, any federal or state bank, credit union or savings bank may be designated a public depository. A surety bond may be required. The State's insured deposits are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and an appropriation for losses on public deposits. In the event of loss, the division of banking makes payments up to $400,000 per depositor for the excess of the payments made by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Wisconsin Credit Union Savings Insurance Corporation. Payments are made, until the funds available in the appropriation are exhausted, in the order in which satisfactory proofs of loss are received by the State's Department of Financial Institutions. 1.Primary Government As of June 30, 2022 , $580.6 million of the primary government's bank balance of $593.0 million was exposed to custodial credit risk as follows (in millions):Uninsured and uncollateralized $ 580.6 Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of a deposit. Deposits in foreign currency at June 30, 2022 are immaterial. The primary government does not have a formal policy specifically related to foreign currency risk. The State's Unemployment Reserve Fund had $1.3 billion on deposit with the U.S. Treasury. This amount is presented as \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" and is not included in the carrying amount of deposits nor is it categorized according to risk because it is neither a deposit with a financial institution nor an investment. Certificates of Deposit are carried at cost as they are considered nonparticipating interest-earning investment contracts. Because they are valued at cost, they are not included in the fair value hierarchy established by GASB Statement 72, Fair Value Measurement and Application. 2.Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) As of December 31, 2021 , WRS cash deposits totaled $620.7 million. Of the total deposits, $123.4 million was collateralized by the securities borrowed. Depository insurance covered another $36.2 million of the total. The remaining deposits, totaling $461.1 million, were uninsured and uncollateralized. These uninsured deposits represented balances held in foreign currencies in the WRS custodian's nominee name, cash posted as collateral for derivatives transactions, and cash collateral posted in excess of the market value of securities borrowed by the WRS for short sales. In addition to cash deposits, the WRS also held $24.0 million in certificates of deposit. 3.Deferred Compensation Cash and cash equivalents for the Deferred Compensation Fund represent the balance of the FDIC Bank Option. The FDIC Bank option provides safety of principal and a stable credited rate of interest and is insured up to $250,000 per participant. As of December 31, 2021 , 83 individual participant accounts held more than $250,000. 4.State Investment Fund The State of Wisconsin appropriation for losses on public deposits protects a depositing municipality up to $400,000 (or less if the appropriation is exhausted) on its proportionate share of all losses of principal invested, if the local governing body has designated the Local Government Investment Pool (LGIP) as a public depository. The actual coverage of these deposits can fluctuate daily based on the allocable share of participants' accounts. In addition, the SIF held time deposits with financial institutions with a fair value of $150.0 million, all of which were uncollateralized and uninsured on June 30, 2022.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 65B.Investments 1.Primary Government Wisconsin Statutes, program policy provisions, appropriate governing boards, and general resolutions contained in revenue bond indenture documents define the types of securities authorized as appropriate investments and the conditions for making investment transactions. Investments of the State are managed by various portfolios. For disclosure purposes, the following investment portfolios are discussed separately: Primary government, excluding the University of Wisconsin System, Wisconsin Retirement System and the State Investment Fund. The primary government portfolios include funds separately managed by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board consisting of the following: -- State Life Insurance Fund (SLIF) -- Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund (IPFCF) -- Historical Society Fund The University of Wisconsin System (UWS) State of Wisconsin Public Employees Deferred Compensation Plan and Trust (Deferred Compensation) Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) State Investment Fund (SIF) -- functions as the State's cash management fund by \"pooling\" the idle cash balances of all State funds and other public institutions.

Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) For the primary government, except for the Separately Managed Funds discussed later, permitted investments include: direct general obligations of the United States of America and obligations (including obligations of any federal agency or corporation) for which the payment of the principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States; bonds or other obligations of any state or the United States of America or of any agency, instrumentality or local governmental unit of any such state including the State of Wisconsin; bonds, debentures, participation certificates, notes or similar evidences of indebtedness of any of the Federal Financing Bank, Federal Home Loan Bank System, Federal Farm Credit Bank, Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Resolution Funding Corporation, Government National Mortgage Association, Student Loan Marketing Association or Tennessee Valley Authority; public housing bonds issued by public agencies or municipalities; commercial paper; interest-bearing time deposits, certificates of deposit or other similar banking arrangements; shares of a diversified open-end management investment company; repurchase agreements; common and preferred stock; banker's acceptances; corporate commercial paper; bonds issued by a local district created under Wisconsin Act 229; and investment agreements with a bank, bank holding company, insurance company or other financial institution. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB or the Board) has control of the investment and collection of principal, interest, and dividends of all monies invested of the State Life Insurance Fund (SLIF), the Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund (IPFCF), and the Historical Society Trust Fund, which are collectively known as the \"Separately Managed Funds\".Permitted classes of investments of the SLIF and the IPFCF include bonds of government units or of corporations, loans secured by mortgages, preferred or common stocks, real property and other investments not specifically prohibited by statute. Funds available for the Historical Society Trust Fund are managed with an investment objective of maintaining a diversified portfolio of high quality publicly issued equities and fixed income obligations providing long-term growth in capital and income generation. University of Wisconsin System (UWS) The UWS Board of Regents authorize and govern the UWS investment policies and guidelines. Beginning in FY 2018, the UWS Board of Regents has delegated investment management authority to SWIB and is responsible for monitoring its delegation of this investment management authority. SWIB determines and sets UWS asset allocation targets which are reviewed quarterly. In addition, UWS continues to have an allocation to private markets through a \"legacy\" portfolio that will self-liquidate over time as investments are sold and cash proceeds are received. The University Cash Management Fund was established in 2022 in accordance with the investment policies and guidelines governed and authorized by the UWS Board of Regents, and is currently distributed among fixed income funds, bank loans, and global equities. The objective of the Cash Management Fund is to manage principal, ensure liquidity for anticipated needs, and maintain purchasing power for existing assets. Target allocations were approved by the University Investment Committee in January 2022. The Cash Management Fund is an intermediate portfolio, governed by and subject to a Memorandum of Understanding between University of Wisconsin System Administration and the University of Wisconsin Madison. An internally managed investment fund was established for a limited and select number of participating Trust Funds accounts by the University Board of Regents to provide an educational investment management opportunity for the UW-Madison School of Business's Applied Security Analysis Program. The \"RegentFund\" is an intermediate-term fixed income portfolio, governed by and subject to a Board-approved Memorandum of Understanding, which includes detailed investment guidelines. The UWS also issues separate financial reports. Copies of these separately issued financial reports may be obtained at www.wisconsin.edu or by writing to: Office of Financial Administration 780 Regent Street, Suite 255 Madison, WI 53715 Deferred Compensation The State of Wisconsin Public Employees Deferred Compensation Plan and Trust (Deferred Compensation) was established in 1981 pursuant to Wisconsin State Statute Section 40.80. Deferred Compensation is governed by the Wisconsin Deferred Compensation Board and is administered by a third party. Under Deferred Compensation Plan provisions, employees of the State of Wisconsin and public employers in Wisconsin that elect to participate are eligible to contribute to the Plan through payroll deductions. Employees electing to participate in the plan may State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 66contribute to or exchange within several available investment options. Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) All assets of the WRS are invested by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (the Board). The WRS consists of shares in the Core Retirement Investment Trust and the Variable Retirement Investment Trust. The investments of the Core Retirement Investment Trust consist of a diversified portfolio of securities. Wis. Stat. Sec. 25.182 authorizes the Board to manage the Core Retirement Investment Trust in accordance with \"prudent investor\" standard of responsibility as described in Wis. Stat. Sec. 25.15(2) which requires that the Board manage the funds with the diligence, skill and care that a prudent person acting in a similar capacity and with the same resources would use in managing a large public pension fund. Investments of the Variable Retirement Investment Trust are authorized under Wis. Stat. Sec. 25.15 and 25.17. Wis. Stat. Sec. 25.17(5) states assets of the Variable Retirement Investment Trust shall be invested primarily in equity securities which shall include common stocks, real estate or other recognized forms of equities whether or not subject to indebtedness, including securities convertible into common stocks and securities of corporations in the venture capital stage. The Variable Retirement Investment Trust consists primarily of common stock and bonds convertible into common stock, although, because of existing conditions in the securities market, there may temporarily be other types of investments. Valuation Investments of the State are reported at Fair Value as defined by GASB Statement Number 72 - Fair Value Measurement and Application and are categorized based on the investment valuation hierarchy established by GASB. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure the fair value of the assets. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 inputs are significant other observable inputs. Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs. The fair value of investments are obtained or estimated using information provided by custodial banks and brokerages. A variety of independent pricing sources are used to price assets based on type, class or issue, including published quotations from active markets, pricing models and other methods deemed acceptable by industry standards.Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) The following tables present fair value measurements as of June 30, 2022 , in millions: Primary Government (excluding the Separately Managed Funds) Fair Value Measurement Using Fair ValueLevel 1 InputsLevel 2 InputsLevel 3 Inputs Investments by Fair Value Level: U.S. Government & Agency Securities $ 189.6 $ 76.0 $ 113.6 $ \u2014 State or Municipal Bonds & Notes 103.7 \u2014 103.7 \u2014 Corporate and Other Bonds and Notes 12.4 \u2014 12.4 \u2014 Closed-End Funds 4.0 4.0 \u2014 \u2014 Exchange Traded Funds 387.7 387.7 \u2014 \u2014 Equity Securities 33.0 33.0 \u2014 \u2014 Limited Partnership 287.7 \u2014 \u2014 287.7 Total By Fair Value Level $ 1,018.1 $ 500.8 $ 229.6 $ 287.7 Investments Valued at Net Asset Value (NAV): Money Market Funds $ 402.8 Mutual Funds 121.9 Investments Valued at Cost: Private Placement 7.1 U.S. Government & Agency Securities 0.2 Long-Term CDs $ 1.1 Total $ 1,551.2 State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 67The following tables present fair value measurements as of June 30, 2022 for the Separately Managed Funds, in millions: Separately Managed Funds Fair Value Measurement Using Total Level 1 Level 2 IPFCF Investments by Fair Value Level: U.S. Government and Agency Securities$ 658.0 $ 6.5 $ 651.5 Corporate Bonds 449.3 \u2014 449.3 Municipal Bonds 20.5 \u2014 20.5 Foreign Bonds 42.0 \u2014 42.0 Total by Fair Value Level $ 1,169.8 $ 6.5 $ 1,163.3 Investments Valued at Net Asset Value (NAV): Equity Index Funds $ 200.0 Short-Term Investment Fund 10.6 Total IPFCF $ 1,380.4 Historical Society Investments Reported at Net Asset Value (NAV): Equity Index Fund $ 16.2 Fixed Income Fund 5.1 Total Historical Society $ 21.2 SLIF Investments by Fair Value Level: U.S. Government and Agency Securities$ 44.3 $ \u2014 $ 44.3 Corporate Bonds 55.1 55.1 Total by Fair Value Level $ 99.4 $ \u2014 $ 99.4 Investments Reported at Net Asset Value (NAV): U.S. Fixed Income Fund $ 2.0 Total SLIF $ 101.4 Securities categorized as Level 1 are valued using prices quoted in active markets for those securities. Debt securities categorized as Level 2 are valued by third party pricing services using a matrix-pricing technique that values securities based on their relationship to quoted market prices for securities with similar interest rates, maturities and credit ratings. Securities categorized as Level 3 include certain Limited Partnership interests in the amount of $ 287.7 million held by the Common School and Normal School funds. These limited partnerships invest in small non-public companies. Shares may typically be redeemed through the investment manager, though the ability to redeem shares may be curtailed during an acute financial crisis. The Common School fund has committed to invest up to $166.0 million in limited partnerships as of June 30, 2022 . The Injured Patients and Families Compensation fund holds Investments in the amount of $10.6 million in the Short-Term Investment Fund, a short-term investment pool. Investments of the Short-Term Investment Fund are reported at net asset value (NAV). Fair values of investments in equity and fixed income co-mingled index funds, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts, and money market funds are based on the investments' published NAV per share (or its equivalent) provided by the investee. These investments are considered Level 1 in the GASB fair value hierarchy. Investments Valued at Cost or Amortized Cost \u2014 Certain investments are valued at cost or amortized cost. Investments valued at cost are not included in the GASB fair value hierarchy. Of the $ 0.2 million of U.S. Government and Agency Securities reported at amortized cost, $0.1 million represents U.S. Government Savings Bonds.

Mutual Funds held by the Plan are open-end Mutual Funds that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These funds are required to publish daily NAV and to transact at that price. The Mutual Funds held by the Plan are deemed to be actively traded. CIT Funds are similar in structure to Mutual Funds but are not regulated by the SEC and are not publicly traded. CIT Funds are valued at NAV, which approximates fair value as a practical expedient. The NAV, as provided by fund administrator, is based State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 68on the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund less liabilities. Participant transactions may occur daily. There are no unfunded commitments and no restrictions on the redemption of these investments. The Stable Value Fund investments are valued at NAV, which consists of contract value less fees and expenses, and approximates fair value as a practical expedient.

Private Fund Investments Private Fund Investments include private equity and real estate. Private Equity Limited Partnerships participated in the following investment strategies at December 31, 2021 : Leveraged Buyout - This strategy acquires the controlling interest of a private company using a significant amount of borrowed capital (leverage). Distressed Debt - This strategy can invest in public and private companies undergoing financial distress, a turnaround in business operations, or which are believed to be undervalued because of a discrete extraordinary event. Growth Equity - This Strategy is an investment opportunity in relatively mature companies that are going through a transformational event in their lifecycle with potential for significant growth. Venture Capital - This strategy invests in companies with potential for significant growth (generally small to early stage emerging firms). Private Debt - This strategy includes any debt held by or extended to privately held companies. The debt securities can be senior debt, mezzanine debt, and structured capital but commonly involve non-bank institutions making loans to private companies or buying those loans on the secondary market. Secondaries - This strategy provides a market for investors to sell or purchase positions in private market funds. Real Estate Limited Partnerships generally consisted of the following investment strategies at December 31, 2021 :State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 71Core - Core investments are expected to deliver a significant percentage of their return from income and should demonstrate lower volatility than Opportunistic and Value investments due to lower leverage, higher occupancy, and asset location. Value - Value investments typically have significant near-term leasing, repositioning, and/or renovation risk. This strategy is expected to have modest initial operating revenues with potential for substantial income growth and will likely encounter greater volatility than Core strategies, but lower volatility than Opportunistic strategies. Opportunistic - Opportunistic investments usually have significant development, lease-up, financial restructuring, and/or liquidity risk with little or no initial operating income. This strategy typically uses the highest leverage, is expected to achieve most of its return from future capital gains, and is likely to encounter greater volatility than Core and Value strategies. Hedge Funds Hedge Fund investments are private investment funds that seek to produce absolute returns using a broad range of strategies. When redeeming Hedge Fund investments, the agreements governing the investment often require advanced notice and may restrict the timing of withdrawals. Hedge Fund agreements can also include \"lock-up\" periods, which restrict investors from redeeming their investment during a specified time frame. The lock-up period helps portfolio managers mitigate liquidity risks. Lock-ups can be \"hard,\" where redemptions are not permitted for a specified time period, or \"soft,\" where redemptions are permitted provided the investor pays a penalty. In certain instances, a fund may have both hard and soft lock-up restrictions in place. In addition, hedge fund managers can also institute a \"rolling\" lock-up. A fund with a rolling lock-up period requires investors to commit to an initial lock-up period, and, if the investor does not submit a redemption notice within a set time prior to expiration of the lock-up, the lock-up is reset. Similar to lock-ups, Hedge Fund agreements also commonly incorporate \"gate\" restrictions. An investor-level gate limits redemption on a particular redemption date to a specified percentage of the investor's account value, while a fund-level gate may limit total investor withdrawals on a particular redemption date to a percentage of aggregated fund-level (or master fund level) net asset value. In certain instances, funds can have both investor- and fund-level gates in place. The WRS participated in the following Hedge Fund strategies at December 31, 2021 : Long-Short Equity - This strategy invests both long and short in publicly-traded stocks. These managers vary in their use of short selling and leverage. Event-Driven - This strategy seeks to gain an advantage from pricing inefficiencies that may occur before or after a corporate action or related event, such as a merger, spinoff, earnings call, bankruptcy, or restructuring. Tactical Trading - This strategy invests in indices, commodities, interest rate instruments, and currencies as a result of relative value or directional forecasts from a systematic or discretionary approach.Relative Value - This strategy uses a range of fixed income arbitrage, insurance linked, long/short credit, and/or quantitative strategies that seek to take advantage of price differentials. Multistrategy - The funds in this category employ a wide range of strategies and instruments in managing assets. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS and SIF) The primary government, except for the Separately Managed Funds discussed later, follows Wisconsin Statutes, program policy provisions, appropriate governing boards, and general resolutions contained in revenue bond indenture documents limits investments in public housing bonds issued by public agencies or municipalities, the State of Wisconsin, interest-bearing time deposits, certificates of deposit or other similar banking arrangement, shares of a diversified open-end management investment company repurchase agreements and investment agreements to a rating no lower than the rating assigned to the bonds. Investments in all other permitted debt securities are required to bear the highest rating available from each nationally recognized rating agency. In addition, credit risk of certain funds such as the Retiree Life Insurance Fund is minimized by monitoring portfolio diversification by asset class, creditor and industry and by complying with investment limitations governed by insurance laws and regulations. Regarding the Separately Managed Funds, investment guidelines require that the bond portfolios shall maintain an average quality rating of A- or better at time of purchase, using the lower of split ratings at the time of purchase.

Fixed income credit risk investment guidelines outline the minimum ratings required at the time of purchase by individual portfolios, or groups of portfolios, based on the portfolios' investment objectives. In addition, some fixed income portfolios are required to always carry a minimum weighted average rating. The following schedule displays the lowest credit rating assigned by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations on debt securities held as of December 31, 2021 (in millions). WRS Rating Commingled Fixed Income Funds 6,843.3 Total $ 54,684.6 Reverse Repurchase Agreements Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) The WRS held $17.0 billion in reverse repurchase agreements at December 31, 2021 . Investment guidelines permit certain portfolios to enter into reverse repurchase agreements, which are a sale of securities with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the securities in the future at the same price plus a stated rate of interest. The market value of the securities underlying reverse repurchase agreements exceeds the cash received, providing the counterparty a margin against a decline in market value of the securities. If the counterparty defaults on their obligations to sell these securities back to the WRS or provide cash of equal value, the WRS could suffer an economic loss equal to the difference between the market value of the underlying securities plus accrued interest and the agreement obligation, including accrued interest. This credit exposure at December 31, 2021 was $130.5 million. The WRS enters into reverse repurchase agreements with various counterparties and such transactions are governed by Master Repurchase Agreements (MRA). MRAs are negotiated contracts and contain terms in which the WRS seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk. The WRS also controls credit exposures by limiting trades with any one counterparty to stipulated amounts. The counterparty credit exposure is managed through the transfer of margin, in the form of cash or securities, between the WRS and the counterparty. The cash proceeds from reverse repurchase agreements are reinvested by the Retirement Funds. The maturities of the purchases made with the proceeds of reverse repurchase State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 73agreements are not necessarily matched to the maturities of the agreements. The agreed-upon yields earned by the counterparty were between 0.07 percent and 0.22 percent at December 31, 2021 . Portfolio guidelines require agreements to mature between one and 90 days. Custodial Credit Risk Custodial credit risk is the risk that, in the event of a failure of the counterparty, the State will not be able to recover the value of the investment or collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) The primary government, including the Separately Managed Funds, does not have an investment policy specifically for custodial credit risk. As of June 30, 2022 , the primary government did not have any direct investment securities exposed to custodial credit risk. Deferred Compensation The Stable Value fund, CIT Funds, and Mutual Funds do not have securities that are used as evidence of the investments and therefore are not exposed to custodial credit risk. Deferred Compensation does not have a formal policy for custodial credit risk. Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) The WRS held repurchase agreements totaling $268.8 million as of December 31, 2021 . These repurchase agreements were tri- party agreements held in a short-term cash management portfolio managed by the WRS's custodian. The underlying securities for these agreements were held by the tri-party agent, not in the WRS's name. The WRS's custodial credit risk policy addresses the primary risks associated with safekeeping and custody. It requires that the WRS's custodial institution be selected through a competitive bid process and that the institution be designated a \"Systemically Important Financial Institution\" by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The policy also requires that the WRS be reflected as beneficial owner on all securities entrusted to the custodian and that the WRS have access to safekeeping and custody accounts. The custodian is also required to carry insurance covering errors and omissions and must provide the WRS with an annual report on internal controls, prepared in accordance with the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements. In addition, WRS management has established a system of controls for the oversight of services and related processes performed by the custodian. The WRS's current custodial bank was selected in accordance with these guidelines and meets all requirements stipulated in the custodial credit risk policy. Concentration of Credit Risk Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of a government's investment in a single issuer. Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) Although the primary government, except for the Separately Managed Funds discussed later, does not have a formal policy on limiting the exposure to concentrations of credit risk, it is the primary government's policy to comply with the provisions contained within the general resolutions of revenue bond indentures and other program policy investment criteria. Debt securities issued by the State of Wisconsin represent the largest concentration of investments in a single issuer. In total, approximately $30.9 million of the reported investments of the permanent funds (a category within non-major governmental funds) were issued by the State of Wisconsin, which represents approximately 3.0 percent of their total investments. The Separately Managed Funds' investment guidelines limit concentrations of credit risk by establishing maximum issuer and/ or sector exposure limits. Generally, the guidelines require that no single issuer may exceed 5.0 percent of the fund investments, with the exception of U.S. Government and its Agencies, whose exposure is unlimited. Excluding investments issued or explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and pooled investments, as of June 30, 2022 , none of the Separately Managed Funds had more than 5.0 percent of their total investments in a single issuer. University of Wisconsin System (UWS) UWS separately managed, debt/fixed income accounts are limited to holding no more than 5.0 percent in any one issuer (U.S. Government/Agencies were exempted). Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) For investments of the WRS, concentration of credit risk is limited by establishing investment guidelines for individual portfolios or groups of portfolios that generally restrict issuer concentrations in any one company or Rule 144A securities to less than 5.0 percent of the portfolio's market value. The WRS did not hold any investments with a single issuer, exclusive of investments issued or explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, representing 5.0 percent or more of the value of the total WRS investments' value at December 31, 2021 . Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates of debt investments will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) Although the primary government, except for the Separately Managed Funds discussed later, does not have a formal policy on limiting the exposure to changes in interest rates, it is the primary government's policy to comply with the provisions contained within the general resolutions of revenue bond indentures and other program policy investment criteria. For example, the Lottery Fund acquires investments with maturity dates that significantly coincide with scheduled payment dates of prize annuities. Investments are held to maturity unless an annuitant requests premature termination of an annuity, then any loss or gain due to market fluctuations are passed through to the redeeming annuitant. Therefore, the Lottery Fund has minimal interest rate risk exposure. Further, as a means of limiting its exposure to interest rate risks, certain funds are required to limit at least half of the fund's investment portfolio to maturities of less than one year. In addition, interest rate risk of certain other funds such as the State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 74Retiree Life Insurance Fund is minimized by maintaining a diversified portfolio of investments and monitoring cash flow patterns in order to approximately match the expected maturity of liabilities. The following table provides information about the interest rate risks associated with the primary government's investments, except those of the Separately Managed Funds. The investments include certain short-term cash equivalents, and various long-term items.

Two of the Separately Managed Funds have investment guidelines relating to interest rate risk. The SLIF guidelines require the Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) of the portfolio, including cash, to be a minimum of ten years. The IPFCF guidelines require that effective duration of the bond portfolio shall remain within 15% of the assigned benchmark's duration and that the average duration should be less than ten years. External Investment Pools The Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund has investments totaling $ 10.6 million at June 30, 2022 in the Short- Term Investment Fund, a pooled short-term investment fund. This balance is reported as \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" on the Statement of Net Position. Investments for the Retiree Life Insurance Funds are held with the insurance carrier, Securian. In accordance with the administrative agreement between the GIB and Securian, interest is calculated and credited to the Retiree Life Insurance plans based on the rate of return for a segment of the insurance carrier's general fund, specifically, 10 Year A- Bonds (as a proxy and not tied to any specific investments). The funds invested during the year earn interest based on that year's rate of return for 10 Year A- Bonds. The overall aggregate interest rate is calculated using a tiered approach based on the year the funds were invested and the rate of return for that year. Investment interest is credited based on the aggregate rate of return and assets are not adjusted to fair market value. Furthermore, the insurance carrier guarantees the principal amounts of the reserves, including all interest previously credited thereto. No significant contract changes occurred during the year.Deferred Compensation Deferred Compensation uses weighted average effective duration to analyze interest rate risk.

Modified duration, which is stated in years, is the measure of price sensitivity of a fixed income security to an interest rate change of 100 basis points. The calculation is based on the weighted average of the present values for all cash flows. Some investments are analyzed using an option adjusted duration calculation which is similar to the modified duration method. Option adjusted duration incorporates the duration shortening effect of any embedded call provisions in the securities. Duration statistics are weighted by the dollar value of the position to compute an average duration for each investment type. Short-term portfolios' interest rate risk is analyzed using the weighted average maturity to next reset. Weighted average maturity is the maturity of each position in a portfolio weighted by the dollar value of the position to compute an average maturity for the portfolio as a whole. This measure indicates a portfolio's sensitivity to interest rate changes: a longer weighted average maturity implies greater volatility in response to interest rate changes.The WRS's investment guidelines related to interest rate risk vary by portfolio. Some fixed income portfolios require management within a range of a targeted duration, while others are required to maintain a weighted average maturity at or below a specified number of days or years. Aggregated interest rate risk exposure as of December 31, 2021 , stated in terms of modified duration (for long term instruments) and weighted average maturity (for repurchase agreements and short-term pooled investments), is presented below (in millions): WRS Investment Type* Fair ValueModified Duration (Years) Asset Backed Securities $ 832.9 3.3 Corporate Bonds & Private Placements 14,676.1 6.9 Foreign Government / Agency Bonds 2,268.9 7.2 Municipal Bonds 188.7 11.5 U.S. Government Agencies 2,312.7 4.8 U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities 21,183.2 7.6 U.S. Treasury Securities 5,576.7 8.5 Commingled Funds: Exchange Traded 465.9 7.6 Emerging Market Fixed Income 1,221.8 4.9 Subtotal 48,726.7 Weighted Average Maturity (days) Commercial Paper 284.3 69 Repurchase Agreements 268.8 3 Commingled Funds: Short Term Management 5,404.7 57 Subtotal 5,957.8 Total $ 54,684.6 *Excludes derivatives which are separately disclosedState of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 77Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely impact the fair value of an investment. Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) The primary government, except for the Separately Managed Funds discussed later, does not have a formal policy to limit foreign currency risk, however, certain funds such as the Environmental Improvement Fund are not permitted to invest in foreign currency based on provisions contained in its bond indenture general resolution. However, foreign currency risk of the Retiree Life Insurance Fund is minimized by utilizing short- duration spot forward contracts to minimize the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in the elapsed time between trade processing and trade settlement. At June 30, 2022 , the primary government, excluding the Separately Managed Funds, did not own any issues denominated in a foreign currency. The Separately Managed Funds' investment guidelines do not specifically address foreign currency risk with the exception that the SLIF only allows investments in U.S. dollar denominated instruments. As of June 30, 2022 , the Separately Managed Funds did not directly own any issues denominated in a foreign currency. Deferred Compensation Deferred Compensation allows the option of investments in Mutual Funds and CIT Funds that make investments in foreign securities. The fair value of these investments was $512.5 million as of December 31, 2021. University of Wisconsin System (UWS) The UWS held positions only in passively-managed, indexed commingled funds which may invest in securities denominated in foreign currencies. However, the fund used for exposure to developed market equities generally seeks to hedge against the variations in returns deriving solely from the value of the foreign currencies in the fund relative to the U.S. dollar. The fund used for exposure to emerging market equities generally does not engage in similar foreign currency hedging efforts, due largely to the high cost and more limited efficacy of such hedging. Deposits in foreign currency for the RegentFund at June 30, 2022 are immaterial.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 78Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) The WRS held foreign currency denominated cash and securities directly in designated actively managed portfolios and indirectly through its investment in certain commingled invest funds.

The bank must obtain collateral from the borrower, or acceptable securities. When UWS securities are delivered to a borrower as part of a securities lending arrangement, the borrower is required to place collateral with the lending agent equal to at least 102% of the loaned securities' fair value, including interest accrued, as of the delivery date. Both the collateral and the securities loaned are marked to market on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as necessary. In the event that the loaned securities are not returned by the borrower, the bank will, at its own expense, either replace the loaned securities or, if unable to purchase those securities on the open market, credit UWS accounts with cash equal to the fair value of the loaned securities. The UWS receives 75 percent of the net revenue derived from all securities lending activities and the bank receives the remainder of the net revenue. Interest and dividend income earned in conjunction with the securities lending program is reported as part of non-operating investment income in the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Fund Net Position. Although the UWS securities lending activities are collateralized as described above, the securities lending program involves both market and credit risk. In this context, market risk refers to the possibility that the borrower of securities will be unable to collateralize the loan upon a sudden material change in the fair value of the loaned securities or the collateral, or that the bank's investment of collateral received from the borrowers of UWS securities may be subject to unfavorable market fluctuations. Credit risk refers to the possibility that counterparties involved in the securities lending program may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their contracts. At June 30, 2022 , the fair value of securities loaned, was $223.8 million. Collateral received consisted of $228.5 million in cash and $0.4 million in non-cash collateral. In accordance with accounting standards the value of the collateral held and a corresponding liability to return the collateral have been reported on the accompanying Statement of Net Position. Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) State statutes and Board policies permit the use of investments of the WRS to enter into securities lending transactions. These transactions involve the lending of securities to broker-dealers and other entities in exchange for collateral, in the form of cash or securities, with the simultaneous agreement to return the collateral for identical securities in the future. The securities custodian acts as an agent in lending the directly-held domestic and international securities. When securities are delivered to a borrower as part of a securities lending agreement, the borrower is required to place collateral equal to at least 102 percent of the loaned securities' fair value, including interest accrued, as of the delivery date with the lending agent. In the event that securities are loaned against collateral denominated in a different currency, the borrower is required to place collateral totaling 105 percent of the loaned securities' fair value, including interest accrued, as of the delivery date with the lending agent. Collateral is marked to market daily and adjusted as needed to maintain the required minimum level. On December 31, 2021 , the fair value of the securities on loan to counterparties was approximately $11.4 billion. Cash collateral is reinvested by the lending agent in two separate pools, a U.S. dollar cash collateral pool and a pool denominated in Euros, in accordance with contractual investment guidelines, which are designed to minimize the risk of principal loss and provide a modest rate of return. Investment guidelines limit credit and liquidity risk by restricting new investments to overnight repurchase agreements collateralized with high quality U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, and sovereign debt securities. The earnings generated from the collateral investments, plus or minus the rebates received from or paid to the dealers and less fees paid to agents, results in the net earnings from lending activities, which are then split on a percentage basis with the lending agent. Cash from the U.S. dollar pool may be posted as collateral relating to short sale transactions and it earns the Overnight Bank Funding rate plus 10 basis points. At December 31, 2021 , the WRS had minimal credit risk exposure to borrowers because loans are collateralized in excess of 100%. In addition to the cash collateral reinvestment indemnification, the contract with the lending agent requires it to indemnify the WRS if the borrowers fail to return the loaned securities and the collateral is inadequate to replace the securities lent. The WRS is also indemnified against losses resulting from violations of investment guidelines. The majority of security loans are open-ended and can be terminated on demand by the WRS or the borrower. Maturities of investments made with cash collateral are not necessarily matched to the maturities of the securities loaned because most loans do not have a fixed maturity date. The risk that the WRS would be unable to return collateral to securities borrowers upon termination of the loan is mitigated by the highly liquid nature of investments held in the collateral reinvestment pools. The average maturities of the loans and the average maturities of the assets held in the collateral reinvestment pools were similar at December 31, 2021 . Securities lending is allowed in certain commingled fund investments. As an investor in such funds, the WRS does not own the underlying securities and does not separately report on securities lending activity. All earnings of these funds are reported in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Derivative Instruments Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) Derivative instruments may be used to implement investment strategies for the Core and Variable Funds. All derivative instruments are subjected to risk analysis and monitoring processes at the portfolio, asset class and fund levels. Investment guidelines define allowable derivative activity for each portfolio and are based on the investment objectives which have been approved by the Board. Where derivative instruments are permitted, guidelines stipulate allowable instruments and the manner and degree to which they are to be used. Gains and losses for all derivative instruments are reported in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. The WRS seeks to mitigate counterparty credit risk through counterparty credit evaluations and approvals, counterparty credit limits, and exposure monitoring procedures. Additionally, policies have been established which seek to implement master netting State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 80arrangements with counterparties that permit the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty. Agreements may also require daily collateral postings to further mitigate credit risk. As of December 31, 2021 , there were 21 counterparties making up the WRS's exposure to counterparty credit risk for uncleared OTC derivative contracts. The exposure of the WRS to counterparty credit risk relating to these was as follows (in millions of US Dollars): OTC Derivative Instruments Subject to Counterparty Credit Risk Counterparty Credit Rating FX Receivables: AA $ 772.6 A 3,444.5 To Be Announced Securities A 1.2 Swap Receivables A 3,497.2 Warrants Not Rated 1.5 Total 7,717.0 Less Collateral and MNA Offsets 7,709.3 Total OTC Counterparty Credit Risk $ 7.7 Foreign Currency Spot and Forward Contracts -Foreign Currency Spot and Forward contracts are uncleared OTC agreements between two counterparties to exchange designated currencies at a specific time in the future. No cash is exchanged when a foreign exchange spot or forward contract is initiated. Amounts due are paid or received on the contracted settle date. Currency exposure management is permitted through the use of currency derivative instruments. Direct hedging of currency exposure back to the US dollar is permitted when consistent with the strategy of the portfolio. Cross-currency exposure management to transfer out of an exposed currency and into a benchmark currency is permitted. Discretionary currency overlay strategies at the total fund and asset class level may be employed when currency market conditions suggest such strategies are warranted. Losses may arise from future changes in the value of the underlying currency, or if the counterparties do not perform under the terms of the contract.

The fair value of futures contracts represents the unrealized gain/ (loss) on the contracts, since trade inception, and is reflected as a portion of \"Financial Futures Contracts and Swaps\" on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. Futures contracts are marked to market daily, based upon the closing market price of the contract at the board of trade or exchange on which they are traded. Gains and losses resulting from investments in futures contracts are included in the \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in the Fair Value of Investments\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position.

Futures contracts involve, to varying degrees, risk of loss in excess of margin deposited with the clearinghouse. Losses may arise from future changes in the value of the underlying instrument. Futures contracts may be entered into for purposes such as 1) to efficiently gain or adjust market exposures for rebalancing, 2) to adjust sector, interest rate, or duration exposure, or 3) to securitize cash or as a substitute for cash market transactions. Swap Contracts - Swaps are negotiated contractual agreements between two counterparties which can be either cleared or uncleared OTC investments. As is specified in the WRS's investment guidelines, swaps may be used as an alternative to physical securities when it is deemed advantageous for portfolio construction. In addition, swaps may be used to adjust asset class exposures for the WRS. Guideline limits and soft risk parameters for each portfolio are applied to the aggregate exposures which includes both physical and synthetic securities. A synthetic security is created by combining securities to mirror the properties of another reference security.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 83Throughout the year, the WRS held positions in Total Return Swaps (TRS), Interest Rate Swaps (IRS), and Credit Default Swaps (CDS).

Under the terms of the contracts, the WRS receives (pays) periodic payments and, in exchange, agrees to pay (receive) a formula-determined amount to counterparties for losses incurred if stipulated credit events occur. CDS spreads are sensitive to credit spread and interest rate changes. The fair value of a CDS contract is determined using the closing price as reported by the applicable clearinghouse. IRS positions represent cleared OTC contracts where the fair value is determined using the closing price as reported by the applicable clearinghouse. The open TRS contracts represent uncleared OTC positions where the WRS gains exposure to the return of the underlying equity index and, in exchange, agrees to pay or receive the stipulated rate benchmark. The rate benchmark is based on the 3-month London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) or the 1-day Fed Funds Rate set by the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) and is sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value for TRS is based on the change in quoted market price of the underlying equity index and represents the unrealized gain/ (loss) on the contracts since trade inception. The fair value of CDS, IRS, and TRS is included in \"Financial Futures Contracts and Swaps\" on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. Gains and losses resulting from investments in swap contracts are included in the \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in the Fair Value of Investments\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Any interest owed but not yet paid relating to swap contracts is reported within \"Accounts Payable and Other Accrued Liabilities\" on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. Interest Expense relating to swap contracts is reported as \"Investment Expense\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Options - An option contract gives the purchaser of the contract the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) the security or index underlying the contract at an agreed upon price on or before the expiration date of the option contract. The seller of the contract is subject to market risk, while the purchaser is subject to credit risk and market risk, to the extent of the premium paid to enter into the contract. Rebalancing policies and portfolio investment guidelines permit the use of exchange-traded and over-the-counter options. Options may be used to improve market exposure efficiency, enhance expected returns, or provide market exposure hedges. Exchange rules require that the seller of short exchange-traded call option contracts cover these positions either by collateral deposits in the form of cash or by pledging, in escrow, the actual securities that would be transferred to the option purchaser in the event the options contract was exercised. In the case of OTC options, investment guidelines mitigate counterparty credit risk by establishing minimum credit ratings and requiring master netting agreements with provisions for collateral exchanges. The fair value of option contracts is based upon the closing market price of the contract and is reflected as \"Options\" on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. Gains and losses as a result of investments in option contracts are included in the \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in the Fair Value of Investments\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 84The table below presents the fair value of option contracts as of December 31, 2021 (in millions): Option Contracts Security DescriptionContract Type PositionExchange- Traded vs. OTC Expiration NotionalFair ValueUnrealized Gain (Loss) Equity Call Long Exchange Jan 22 - Mar 22 $ 14.4 $ 0.3 $ (2.9) Equity Call Short Exchange Jan 22 - Mar 22 (48.9) (0.5) 0.5 Equity Put Long Exchange Jan 22 9.4 0.1 (0.4) Equity Put Short Exchange Jan 22 (24.6) (1.7) \u2014 Equity Index Put Short Exchange Jan 22 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 OTC Index Put Short OTC Jan 22 - Feb 22 (416.9) (0.1) 0.9 Total $ (466.6) $ (1.9) $ (1.9) To Be Announced Securities - To be announced mortgage- backed (TBA) securities are uncleared OTC forward contracts consisting of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by Government National Mortgage Association, a government entity, and by government-sponsored enterprises such as, the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. The term TBA is derived from the fact that the actual MBS that will be delivered to fulfill a TBA trade is not designated at the time the trade is made. Instead, the specific pool of mortgages making up the MBS is announced 48 hours prior to the established trade settlement date. Eligibility rules and standards for MBS pools deliverable into TBA contracts ensure that delivered MBS pools are fungible. Payment for TBA securities is not made until the settlement date. Certain portfolio investment guidelines allow for both long and short TBA positions. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, guidelines establish minimum credit ratings and require master netting agreements which include provisions for collateral exchanges. TBAs, much like their underlying MBS securities, may be highly sensitive to interest rate changes. This is because the MBS pool on which these forward contracts are based can be subject to early payment in a period of declining interest rates. The price of TBAs can fluctuate as the marketplace predicts changes in timing, or possible reductions in expected cash flows, associated with a change in interest rates. The table below presents the fair value of TBA securities as of December 31, 2021 (in millions). Duration statistics are weighted by the fair value of each position to compute an average duration for the contracts held.

The unrealized gain/ loss associated with these contracts is included within the \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in the Fair Value of Investments\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Warrants \u2014 A warrant is a contract that entitles the holder to buy the underlying stock of the issuing company at a specified price. Warrants and options are similar in that the two instruments allow the holder special rights to buy securities. However, warrants differ from options in that they provide additional financing to the issuing company when exercised. As of December 31, 2021 , the WRS held warrant contracts valued at $2.3 million. Warrants are included in the \"Equities\" section on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. The associated unrealized gain of $1.2 million is included in the \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in the Fair Value of Investments\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Short Sell Obligations Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) The WRS may sell a security it does not own in anticipation of purchasing the security later at a lower price. This is known as a short sale transaction. For the duration of the short sale transaction, a liability is recorded under \"Short Sales of Securities\" on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. The liability presented represents the fair value of the shorted securities necessary for delivery to the purchaser and is marked-to-market daily. Realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with short sales are recorded on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position within the \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in Fair Value of Investments\" category. Prior to executing a short sale, the WRS borrows the security from a party currently holding it. While the transaction is open, the WRS incurs expenses for securities borrowing costs. In addition, as a security borrower, the WRS may incur dividend and interest expense as such payments must be remitted to the security lender during the course of the loan. During the duration of the borrow, there may be corporate action elections requiring the borrower to deliver items such as cash or securities to the lender. Such expenses are included in \"Investment Expense\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 85Risks arise from short sales due to the possible illiquidity of the securities markets and from potential adverse movements in security values. The cost to acquire the securities sold short may exceed the amount of proceeds initially received, as well as the amount of the liability recorded as \"Short Sales of Securities\" in the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. Short sales expose the short seller to potentially unlimited liability because there is no upward limit on the price a shorted security could attain. Certain portfolio guidelines permit short sales and, to mitigate risks in various ways, such as: limiting the total value of short sales as a percentage of portfolio value, establishing portfolio vs. benchmark tracking error limits, and monitoring other statistical and economic risk measures of the portfolio. Investment performance and risk associated with each portfolio is measured against benchmarks and monitored by management. When a short sale occurs, the shorting portfolio must borrow the security and deliver it to the buyer. If the shorted security is owned by another WRS portfolio, investment policies allow the borrowing of the shorted securities from other WRS portfolios. Except in the case of borrowings within the same trust fund, the WRS is required to post collateral to the lender, at the required rate of 102% for in-currency loans and 105% for cross-currency loans. At December 31, 2021 , the WRS posted $127.2 million in cash and $5.2 billion in securities as collateral to security lenders. This represented $46.1 million in excess of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. If the security lender recalled the security and the WRS was not able to supply the lender with the security, the lender would be permitted to use the WRS's collateral to fund the purchase of the security. 2.State Investment Fund The State Investment Fund (SIF) pools the cash of the State of Wisconsin and its agencies, the WRS, and various local government units (Local Government Investment Pool - LGIP) into a commingled fund with the investment objective of safety of principal and liquidity while earning a competitive money market rate of return. In the State's Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the SIF is not reported as a separate fund; rather, each State fund's share in the \"pool\" is reported on the balance sheet as \"Cash and Cash Equivalents.\" Shares of the SIF belonging to other participating public institutions are presented in the Local Government Pooled Investment Fund, an investment trust fund. Wis. Stat. Secs. 25.17(3)(b), (ba), (bd) and (dg) enumerate the various types of securities in which the SIF can be invested, which include obligations of the United States or its agencies, corporations wholly owned by the United States or chartered by an act of Congress, securities guaranteed by the United States, the unsecured notes of financial and industrial issuers, direct obligations of or guaranteed by the government of Canada, certificates of deposit issued by banks in the United States including solvent financial institutions in Wisconsin and banker's acceptances. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board's (the Board) Board of Trustees may specifically approve other prudent legal investments. For financial statement purposes, the carrying value of securities depends on asset class. Repurchase Agreements and nonnegotiable Certificates of Deposit and Time Deposits are valued at cost because they are non-participating contracts that do not capture interest rate changes in their value. All remaining debt investments (U.S. Government/ Agency securities, Banker's Acceptances, Commercial Paper, Corporate Notes, and negotiable Certificates of Deposit) are carried at fair value. Because quoted market prices for SIF securities are often not available at month end, BNY Mellon, as SWIB's custodial bank, compiles fair values from third party pricing services which use matrix pricing models to estimate a security's fair value. For purposes of calculating earnings to each participant, all investments are valued at amortized cost. Specifically, income is distributed to pool participants monthly, based on their average daily share balance. Distributions include interest income based on stated rates (both paid and accrued), amortization of discounts and premiums on a constant yield basis, realized investment gains and losses calculated on an amortized cost basis, and investment expenses. This method does not distribute to participants any unrealized gains and losses generated by the pool's investments. SIF pool shares are bought and redeemed at $1.00 based on the amortized cost of the investments in the SIF. The State of Wisconsin does not provide any legally binding guarantees to support the value of pool shares. Fair Value Reporting The SIF categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure the fair value of the asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, Level 2 inputs are significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs. Investments held at cost or amortized cost are not reported within the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2022 (in millions): Fair Value Measurement Using Fair ValueLevel 1 InputsLevel 2 InputsLevel 3 Inputs Investments by Fair Value Level: Government & Agencies $ 10,607.2 $ 1,314.1 $ 9,293.0 $ \u2014 Commercial Banker's Acceptances 50.0 \u2014 20.0 30.0 Corporate Notes 22.6 \u2014 22.6 \u2014 Total By Fair Value Level $ 11,355.9 $ 1,314.1 $ 9,938.8 $ 103.0 Short-Term Reported at Cost or Amortized Cost: Repurchase Agreements $ 9,023.4 Time Deposits (non- negotiable) 150.0 Total $ 20,529.4 State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 86Debt securities categorized as Level 2 are valued using observable inputs by third party pricing services using a matrix - pricing technique. Matrix pricing is used to value securities based on their relationship to quoted market prices for securities with similar interest rates, maturities, and credit ratings. Most debt securities are classified as Level 2 because they are generally traded using a dealer market, with lower trading volumes than Level 1 securities. Level 3 investments are generally valued using significant inputs that are unobservable to the marketplace. Banker's Acceptances included in Level 3 represent securities that derive their fair value from cost. Typically, due to their short-term nature, cost approximates fair value for these investments. Investments held at cost (Repurchase Agreements and Time Deposits with maturity less than 90 days) are not reported within the fair value hierarchy. Custodial Credit Risk The custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the counterparty to a transaction, the Board will not be able to recover the value of investments or collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. Investments are exposed to custodial credit risk if the securities are uninsured and unregistered and are either held by the counterparty or by the counterparty's trust department or agent but not in the name of the Board. The SIF held repurchase agreements totaling $9.0 billion as of June 30, 2022 . Four of the repurchase agreements are bilateral agreements totaling $1.7 billion and the underlying securities (collateral) for these were held at SWIB's custodian. Nine of the repurchase agreements totaling $2.6 billion, were tri-party agreements. The underlying securities (collateral) for these repurchase agreements were held by the tri-party's agent, not in SWIB's name. The remaining repurchase agreements, totaling $4.7 billion, were related-party, bilateral agreements with the WRS. The underlying securities for these repurchase agreements were held by SWIB's custodian, in SWIB's name. The related party repurchase transactions with the WRS were overnight agreements collateralized with U.S. Treasury securities. The WRS is also a participant in the SIF, with investments totaling $1.4 billion (Core Fund) and $377.8 million (Variable Fund) at June 30, 2022 . The SIF's custodial credit risk policy addresses the primary risks associated with safekeeping and custody. It requires that custodial institutions be selected through a competitive bid process and that the institution be designated a \"Systemically Important Financial Institution\" by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The policy also requires that the SIF be reflected as beneficial owner on all securities entrusted to the custodian and that the SIF has access to safekeeping and custody accounts. The custodian is also required to be insured for errors and omissions and must provide the SIF with an annual report on internal controls. The SIF's current custodial bank was selected in accordance with these guidelines and meets all requirements stipulated in the custodial credit risk policy. Concentration of Credit Risk Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of an organization's investment in a single issuer. The SIF's investment guidelines limit concentrations of credit risk by establishing maximum issuer and/or issue exposure limits based on credit rating. These guidelines do not place a limit on maximum exposure for any U.S. Treasury or Agency discount notes. As of June 30, 2022 , the SIF has more than five percent of its investments in FHLB (38.7 percent), U.S. Treasury (9.1 percent) and Repurchase Agreement collateral (44.0 percent) consisting of various securities issued by the U.S. Government and its agencies. Since the Repurchase Agreements generally mature each day, new collateral, consisting of a different blend of U.S. Government and agency securities, is assigned each day. Credit Quality Risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. The Board established investment guidelines with maximum exposure limits by security type based on the minimum credit ratings as issued by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs). The following table presents these credit ratings and aggregate exposures by investment type as of June 30, 2022 (in millions): Investment Type RatingsFair Value Repurchase Agreements (Collateral): U.S. Government & Agencies Debt AA $ 9,023.4 Government Sponsored Entity U.S. Agency: Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) A-1+ 7,899.4 Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) AA 41.1 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) A-1+ 306.9 Federal Farm Credit Bank (FFCB) A-1+ Credit Bank (FFCB) Treasury: Short-Term (Bills and Notes) Long-Term (Notes) AA 134.1 Commercial Paper A-1+ A-1+ 150.0 Banker's Acceptances A-1+ 50.0 Corporate Notes AAA 1.5 Corporate Notes AA 21.1 Total Investments $ 20,529.4 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. The Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) method is used to analyze interest rate risk. Investment guidelines mandate that the WAM for the entire portfolio will not exceed one year.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 87At June 30, 2022 , the following table shows the investments by investment type, amount and the weighted average maturities (in millions): Investment Type Fair ValueWeighted Average Maturity (Days) Government & Agencies 10,607.2 42 Repurchase Agreements $ 9,023.4 1 Commercial Paper 676.2 16 Time Deposits 150.0 1 Banker's Acceptances 50.0 33 Corporate Notes 22.6 55 Total Investments $ 20,529.4 Portfolio Weighted Average Maturity (Days) 23 Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely impact the fair value of an investment.

ENDOWMENTS Primary Government University of Wisconsin System The University of Wisconsin System invested its trust funds, principally gifts and bequests designated as endowments or quasi- endowments, in two of its own investment pools: the Long Term Fund and the Applied Security Analysis Program \"RegentFund.\" In Fiscal Year 2018, the Board of Regents transferred its investment management responsibilities of the Long Term Fund to the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) as permitted through Section 36.11 (11m) of the Wisconsin statutes. The RegentFund was established on April 1, 2019, as an investment fund for a limited number of participating Trust Funds accounts. The RegentFund is an intermediate-term fixed income portfolio, governed by and subject to a Board- approved Memorandum of Understanding, which includes detailed investment guidelines. Benefiting University of Wisconsin System entities receive quarterly distributions from the Long Term Fund, principally endowed assets, based on an annual spending rate applied to a 12-quarter moving average market value of the fund. The annual spending rate is currently 4.0 percent. Distributions from the RegentFund, principally quasi-endowments and unspent income distributions, consist of interest earnings distributed quarterly. Spending rate and interest distributions from both of these funds are transferred to the State Investment Fund, pending near-term expenditures. At June 30, 2022 , net appreciation of the endowment accounts was $166.0 million which was available to meet spending rate distributions, of which $20.6 million was actually authorized for expenditure. For University of Wisconsin System-controlled, donor-restricted endowments, the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act as adopted, permits the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System to appropriate for current spending, an amount of realized and unrealized endowment appreciation as they determine to be prudent. Realized and unrealized appreciation in excess of that amount appropriated for current spending is retained by the endowments. University of Wisconsin System investment policies and guidelines are governed and authorized by the Board of Regents. The approved asset allocation for the new SWIB-managed Long Term Fund has a target to public markets of the following: 57.0 percent public equities, 20.0 percent fixed income, and 23.0 percent inflation sensitive securities. Private markets are not included in the target asset allocation. The legacy private markets investments will self-liquidate as distributions are made from existing funds with no new commitments intended. The fair value of Endowments as of June 30, 2022 was $530.2 million including an unrealized loss of $62.6 million when fair values as of June 30, 2022 are compared to asset acquisition costs. The calculation of realized gains and losses is independent of a calculation of the net change in the fair value of investments since realized gains and losses are based on the difference between the selling price and the acquisition cost of the asset. Therefore, when assets are reported at fair value much of the realized gain or loss may have already been included in prior years as part of the overall change in the fair value of investments.At June 30, 2022 , the book value and fair value of principal funds under control of the University of Wisconsin System was (in millions): Original Contributions and Distributed Net Gains $ 347.3 Realized Gains - Undistributed 245.5 Book Value 592.8 Unrealized Net Gains/Losses - Undistributed Fair Value $ 530.2 On June 30, 2022 , the portfolio at market, for the Long Term Fund, contained 38.9 percent in global equities, 17.0 percent in Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS), 16.8 percent in investment grade government/credit, 5.2 percent in hedged non-U.S. equities, 2.7 percent in real estate investment trusts, 2.4 percent in emerging markets equities, and 17.0 percent in private markets. The total return (loss) on the principal Long Term Fund including capital appreciation was (7.6) percent for the year. On June 30, 2022 , the portfolio at market, for the RegentFund, contained 93.2 percent in fixed income securities and 6.8 percent in cash and cash equivalents. The total return on the principal RegentFund including capital appreciation was (10.7) percent for the year.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 93NOTE 9.

Section 40.05(2)(b) and its unfunded accrued liability for sick leave conversion credits under Wis. Stat. Section 40.05(4)(b), (bc), and (bw) and Subchapter IX of Chapter 40. In April and June 2008, the State issued $1.0 billion of General Fund Annual Appropriation Refunding Bonds to refund the Series B (Taxable Auction Rate Certificates) that were issued in 2003. The 2008 issuance consisted of Series A (Taxable Fixed Rate) and Series B and C (Taxable Floating Rate Notes).

The State is not legally obligated to appropriate any amounts for payment of debt service. The Legislature, recognizing its moral obligation to make timely appropriations from the General Fund sufficient to pay debt service on such obligations, expresses in Wis. Stat. Section 16.527(10) its expectation and aspiration that it will do so. The Legislature's recognition of a moral obligation, however, does not create a legally enforceable obligation. The General Fund Annual Appropriation Bonds of 2003, Series A (Taxable Fixed Rate) in the outstanding principal amount of $349.6 million (\"2003 Series A Bonds\"), bear interest at a rate of 5.70 percent computed on the basis of a 30-day month and a 360- day year, payable semiannually on each May 1 and November 1 until their maturity dates.

Certificates of Participation The State established a facility in 1992 that provides lease purchase financing for property and certain service items acquired by state agencies. This facility is the Third Amended and Restated Master Lease between the State acting by and through the Department of Administration and U.S. Bank National Association. Lease purchase obligations under the Master Lease are not general obligations of the State but are payable from appropriations of State agencies participating in the Master Lease Program, subject to annual appropriation. The interest component of each lease/ purchase payment is subject to a separate determination. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of this agreement, the trustee for the facility issues parity Master Lease certificates of participation that evidence proportionate interest of the owners thereof in lease payments. A common pool of collateral ratably secures all Master Lease certificates. Title in the property and service items purchased under the facility remains with the State and the State grants to the Trustee, for the benefit of all Master Lease certificate holders, a first security interest in the leased items. The outstanding balance as of June 30, 2022 was as follows: Balance DueAverage Life (Weighted Term) $67.7 Million 3.02 Years At June 30, 2022 , the following parity Master Lease certificates were outstanding (in thousands): IssueIssue DateInterest RatesMaturity Through Issued Outstanding $ 63,727 $ 67,660 *see Revolving Credit AgreementState of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 105As of June 30, 2022 , Master Lease certificate debt service requirements for principal and interest for governmental activities and business-type activities are as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Governmental Activities Business-Type Activities Ended June 30 Principal Interest Principal Interest 2023 $ 10,825 $ 2,023 $ 184 7,284 4,988 1,160 Total 57,425 7,284 10,236 1,480 Revolving Credit Agreement Master Lease Certificates of Participation of 2013, Series A (Revolving Credit Agreement - Taxable) in the amount of $8.4 million .

Specifically, the excess of the aggregated amount earned on investments purchased with bond proceeds over the amount that would have been earned if the proceeds were invested at a rate equal to the bond yield, is to be rebated to the federal government. As of June 30, 2022 , a liability for arbitrage rebate did not exist. I.Moral Obligation Debt Through legislation enacted in 1999, the State authorized the creation of local districts. One district, the Wisconsin Center District, is currently authorized to issue bonds for specific purposes, and if the State determines that certain conditions are satisfied, the State may have a moral obligation to appropriate moneys to make up deficiencies in the district's special debt service reserve fund. To date, the Wisconsin Center District has the authority for up to $300.0 million in bonds for this purpose, plus refunding bonds. The Wisconsin Center District has one outstanding series of bonds in the outstanding balance of $300.0 million and two outstanding refunding series with an outstanding balance of $111.8 million that are subject to the moral obligation pledge to appropriate moneys to make up deficiencies in the debt service reserve funds.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 107Through legislation enacted in 1999, the State authorized the issuance of up to $170.0 million principal amount of bonds to finance the development or redevelopment of sites and facilities to be used for public schools.

State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 108NOTE 12. LEASE COMMITMENTS AND INSTALLMENT PURCHASES The State leases office buildings, space, and equipment under a variety of agreements that vary in lease term, many of which are subject to appropriation from the State Legislature to continue the lease commitment. If such funding, i.e., through legislative appropriation, is judged to be assured, and the likelihood of cancellation through exercise of the fiscal funding clause is remote, leases are considered non-cancelable. Lease payments are generally fixed monthly or annually. The State also leases land, facility space, and equipment to various third parties as the lessor. The University of Wisconsin System recognized revenue related to these leases totaling $5.4 million during FY 2022. The University of Wisconsin System leases certain assets that are subsequently subleased to a third party. The non-cancelable terms of these leasing arrangements mature between 2023 and 2036. The discount rates applicable to these leasing arrangements range from 0.53% to 1.81%. The State does not currently report any sale-leaseback or lease- leaseback transactions under GASB 87 as of June 30, 2022 . The State does not currently report any contracts with residual value guarantees, termination penalties, commitments prior to the commencement of the lease, or impairment under GASB 87 as of June 30, 2022 . A.GASB 87 Leases GASB Statement No. 87, Leases , became effective for the reporting period ending June 30, 2022. With certain exceptions, under GASB 87 all leases are considered finance leases and are reported accordingly. The concept is that leases represent a means to finance the right to use an underlying asset. Lease commitments in the government-wide and proprietary fund statements are reported as liabilities at lease inception.The related assets along with the amortization are also reported at that time as right-to-use assets. Right-to-use assets at inception are recorded at the present value of total lease payments as shown in Note 7. These payments are discounted at the State's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments are reported as a reduction of the liability. For lessor transactions, the State records lease receivables and deferred inflows of resources based on the present value of expected receipts over the lease term. The expected receipts are recorded at the present value of total lease payments using the State's incremental borrowing rate. Primary Government For leases in governmental funds, \"Other Financing Sources - Lease Acquisitions\" and expenditures are recorded at lease inception. Lease payments are recorded as expenditures.The following is an analysis of future principal and interest payment requirements related to the State's lease liability as of June 30, 2022 (in thousands): Governmental Activities Fiscal Year Principal Interest 324,596 36,192 Business- type Activities Fiscal Year Principal Total $ 275,339 $ 47,018 State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 109NOTE 13. POLLUTION REMEDIATION AND ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Pollution Remediation Obligations Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 49, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pollution Remediation Obligations , establishes accounting and financial reporting standards for pollution remediation obligations. These are obligations to address the current or potential detrimental effects of existing pollution by participating in pollution remediation activities such as site assessments and cleanups. The scope of the standard excludes pollution prevention or control obligations with respect to current operations, and future pollution remediation obligations that are required upon retirement of an asset, such as landfill closure and post closure care and nuclear power plant decommissioning. Measurement of Obligations GASB Statement No. 49 requires the State to calculate pollution remediation obligations using the expected cash flow technique. These estimates are subject to change over time. Costs may vary due to price fluctuations, changes in technology, changes in potential responsible parties, results of environmental studies, changes to statutes or regulations and other factors. Recoveries from other responsible parties may reduce the State's obligation. In accordance with the standard, if the State cannot reasonably estimate a pollution remediation obligation, it does not report a liability. Under specific circumstances capital assets may be created when pollution remediation is performed. During the fiscal year, the State expended $5.6 million to clean up sites. Estimates of existing pollution remediation liabilities were also increased by $0.4 million. In total, the restated beginning liability of $5.5 million decreased to $0.2 million. There were no recoveries received from other responsible parties during the fiscal year and none are expected for the identified obligations.Identified Remediation Obligations Pollution remediation liabilities are updated annually and are based on engineering studies and the judgment of agency officials. The following table shows liabilities included in the Statement of Net Position as of June 30, 2022 (in millions): Nature and Source of PollutionEstimated LiabilityEstimated Recovery Contract agreement with EPA to clean up Superfund site for former wood treatment facility$ 0.2 $ \u2014 Voluntary commencement by the State to clean up heavy metal contamination of canal near former industrial site \u2014 \u2014 Total estimated obligations $ 0.2 $ \u2014 In addition to the liability reported in the table above, the State expects to incur estimated costs of $10,000 per year indefinitely to pump and treat contamination at a former chrome plating facility. The State also expects to incur estimated costs of $70,000 per year indefinitely to operate and maintain a closed landfill. Both are Superfund sites and estimated total remediation costs for them cannot be reasonably determined. Therefore, a liability has not been reported in the Statement of Net Position for either site. Asset Retirement Obligations GASB Statement No. 83, Certain Asset Retirement Obligations (GASB 83), establishes criteria for determining the timing and pattern of recognition of a liability and a corresponding deferred outflow of resources for asset retirement obligations. In accordance with the statement, the University of Wisconsin System has recognized asset retirement obligations of $13.1 million as of June 30, 2022 , related to decommissioning costs for a nuclear research reactor. This obligation was recognized based on the best estimate of the current value of outlays expected to be incurred. The corresponding deferred outflow of resources is amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the associated tangible capital asset coinciding with a licensure period through the year 2031. The University of Wisconsin System has issued a statement to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission of intent to obtain funds necessary for decommissioning, when necessary. No restricted assets are set aside for payment of the asset retirement obligations.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 110NOTE 14.

All employees, initially employed by a participating WRS employer prior to July 1, 2011, expected to work at least 600 hours a year (440 hours for teachers and school district educational support employees) and expected to be employed for at least one year from employee's date of hire are eligible to participate in the WRS. All employees, initially employed by a participating WRS employer on or after July 1, 2011, and expected to work at least 1200 hours a year (880 hours for teachers and school district educational support employees) and expected to be employed for at least one year from employee's date of hire are eligible to participate in the WRS. Note: Employees hired to work nine or ten months per year, (e.g. teachers contracts), but expected to return year after year are considered to have met the one-year requirement. As of December 31, 2021 , the number of participating employers was: State Agencies 56 Cities 189 Counties 71 Villages 291 Towns 287 School Districts 421 Wisconsin Technical College System Board Districts 16 Cooperative Educational Service Agencies 12 Other 212 Total Employers 1,555 For employees beginning participation on or after January 1, 1990 and no longer actively employed on or after April 24, 1998, creditable service in each of five years is required for eligibility for a retirement annuity. Participants employed prior to 1990 and on or after April 24, 1998 and prior to July 1, 2011 are immediately vested. Participants who initially became WRS eligible on or after July 1, 2011 must have five years of creditable service to be vested. Employees who retire at or after age 65 (54 for protective occupation employees, 62 for elected officials and State executive participants) are entitled to receive an unreduced retirement benefit. The factors influencing the benefit are: (1) final average earnings, (2) years of creditable service, and (3) a formula factor. Final average earnings is the average of the participant's three highest years' earnings. Creditable service is the creditable current and prior service expressed in years or decimal equivalents of partial years for which a participant receives earnings and makes contributions as required. The formula factor is a standard percentage based on employment category. Vested employees may retire at age 55 (50 for protective occupation employees) and receive reduced benefits. Employees terminating covered employment before becoming eligible for a retirement benefit may withdraw their contributions and forfeit all rights to any subsequent benefits, or may leave contributions on deposit and defer application until eligible to receive a retirement benefit. The WRS also provides death and disability benefits for employees. The Employee Trust Funds Board may periodically adjust annuity payments from the WRS based on annual investment performance in accordance with s. 40.27, Wis. Stat. An increase (or decrease) in annuity payment may result when investment gains (losses), together with other actuarial experience factors, create a surplus (shortfall) in the reserves, as determined by the WRS' consulting actuary. Annuity increases are not based on cost of living or other similar factors. For Core Retirement Investment Trust annuities, decreases may be applied only to previously granted increases. By law, Core Retirement Investment Trust fund annuities cannot be reduced to an amount below the original, guaranteed amount set at retirement. Accounting Policies and Plan Asset Matters The financial statements of the WRS have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, using the flow of economic resources measurement focus and a full accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded at the time the liabilities are incurred. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which contributions are paid. Employer contributions to the plan are recognized in the accounting period in which the underlying earnings on which the contributions are based are paid and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of the plan. All assets of the WRS are invested by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. The retirement fund assets consist of shares in the Variable Retirement Investment Trust and the Core Retirement Investment Trust. The Variable Retirement Investment Trust consists primarily of equity securities. The Core Retirement Investment Trust is a balanced investment fund made up of fixed income securities and equity securities. Shares in the Core Retirement Investment Trust are purchased as funds are made available from retirement contributions and investment income, and sold when funds for benefit payments and other expenses are needed. The assets of the Core and Variable Retirement Investment Trusts are carried at fair value with all market value adjustments recognized in current operations. Investments are revalued monthly to current market value. The resulting valuation gains or losses are recognized as income, although revenue has not been realized through a market-place transaction.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 111The WRS does not have any investments (other than those issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government) in any one organization that represent 5.0 percent or more of plan net position. Contributions Required Required contributions are determined by an annual actuarial valuation in accordance with Chapter 40 of the Wisconsin Statutes. The employee required contribution is one-half of the actuarially determined contribution rate for general category employees, including teachers, and executives and elected officials. In 2016, executives & elected officials' contributions rates were changed to match General. Required contributions for protective contributions are the same rate as general employees. Employers are required to contribute the remainder of the actuarially determined contribution rate. The employer may not pay the employee required contribution unless provided for by an existing collective bargaining agreement. Contribution rates as of June 30, 2022 are: Employee Employer General (including teachers) 6.50% 6.50% Executives & Elected Officials 6.50% 6.50% Protective with Social Security 6.50% 12.00% Protective without Social Security 6.50% 16.40% Employers are required to contribute an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund the remaining projected cost of future benefits. State of Wisconsin Net Pension Asset, Pension Contributions, Pension Revenue, and Deferred Outflows and Inflows of Resources At June 30, 2022 the State reported a net pension asset of $2.30 billion for its proportionate share of the WRS' net pension asset. It is presented as a net pension asset on the Statement of Net Position for proprietary funds and on the government-wide Statement of Net Position. The net pension asset was measured as of December 31, 2021 , and the total pension liability was based on an actuarial valuation as of December 31, 2020 . Update procedures were used to roll forward the total pension liability to the measurement date. No material changes in assumptions or benefit terms occurred between the actuarial valuation date and the measurement date. The State's proportionate share of the net pension asset was determined based on the State's share of contributions to the WRS relative to the contributions of all participating employers. At December 31, 2021 , the State's proportionate share was 28.5 percent, which is an increase of 0.4 percent from its proportionate share as of December 31, 2020 . For calendar year 2021 , State employers made $333.9 million in contributions recognized by the WRS. For the year ended June 30, 2022 , the State recognized pension revenue of $196.5 million. At June 30, 2022 , the State reported deferred outflows and inflows of resources related to pensions of $4.30 billion and $5.40 billion, respectively. Deferred outflows and inflows related to pensions, including the types and the amounts applicable to each type, can be found in table below (in thousands): Deferred Outflows of ResourcesDeferred Inflows of Resources Differences Between Expected and Actual Pension Experience $ 3,705,525 $ (267,208) Changes of Pension Assumptions 427,946 \u2014 Net Difference Between Projected and Actual Earnings on Pension Investments \u2014 (5,131,432) Changes in Proportionate Share 7,192 (4,609) Pension Contributions Subsequent to the Measurement Date 162,200 \u2014 Total $ 4,302,863 $ (5,403,249) The $162.2 million in deferred outflows of resources resulting from contributions subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized as a decrease to the net pension liability or an increase to the net pension asset in the year ended June 30, 2023 . Other amounts reported as deferred outflows and inflows of resources related to pensions will be recognized as pension expense as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended June 30 Amount 2023 $ (105,479) (620,983) 2025 (273,322) presenting multi-year trend information of the State's proportionate share of the net pension liability or asset is presented as required supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 112Actuarial Valuation The pension measurements as of December 31, 2021 were based upon the following actuarial assumptions: Actuarial Valuation Date December 31, 2020 Measurement Date of Net Pension Liability (Asset) December 31, 2021 Actuarial Cost Method Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method Fair Value Long-Term Expected Rate of Return 6.8% Discount Rate 6.8% Salary Increases Inflation 3.0% 1.7% * No post-retirement adjustments are guaranteed. Actual adjustments are based on recognized investment return, actuarial experience, and other factors. The assumed annual adjustment is 1.7%, based on the investment return assumption and the post-retirement discount rate. This includes the impact of known Market Recognition Account deferred gains/losses on the liability for dividend payments. Actuarial assumptions are based upon an experience study conducted in 2021 using experience from 2018-2020. The total pension liability for December 31, 2021 is based upon a roll- forward of the liability calculated from the December 31, 2020 actuarial valuation. Long-Term Expected Return on Plan Assets The long-term expected rate of return on WRS investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return, net of WRS investment expense and inflation, are developed for each major asset class. The ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. The long-term expected rate of return is reviewed every three years in conjunction with the WRS experience study. For each major asset class that is included in the Core Retirement Investment Trust fund's target asset allocation as of December 31, 2021 , these best estimates of geometric long- term real rates of return were used: Asset Class Target Allocation Rate of Return Global Equities 52.0% 4.2% Fixed Income 25.0 1.8 Inflation Sensitive 19.0 0.2 Real Estate 7.0 3.0 Private Equity/Debt 12.0 7.0 For each major asset class that is included in the Variable Retirement Investment Trust fund's target asset allocation as of December 31, 2021 , these best estimates of geometric long-term real rates of return were used: Asset Class Target Allocation Rate of Return Domestic Equity 70.0% 3.7% International Equity 30.0 4.6 The money-weighted rates of return on pension plan investment for the Core and Variable funds for the calendar year ended 2021 were 17.03% and 19.98%, respectively. The money-weighted rate of return expresses investment performance, net of pension plan expenses, adjusted for the changing amount actually invested. Discount Rate A single discount rate of 6.8% was used to measure the total pension liability, as opposed to a discount rate of 7.0% for the prior year. The discount rate is based on the expected rate of return on pension plan investments. Because of the unique structure of the WRS, the 6.8% expected rate of return implies that a dividend of approximately 1.7% will always be paid. For purposes of the single discount rate, it was assumed that the dividend would always be paid. The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that plan member contributions will be made at the current contribution rate and that employer contributions will be made at rates equal to the difference between actuarially determined contribution rates and the member rate. Based on these assumptions, the pension plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments (including expected dividends) of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The following presents the State's proportionate share of the net pension liability (asset), calculated using a single discount rate of 6.8%, as well as what the State's net pension liability (asset) would be if it were calculated using a single discount rate that is 1% lower or 1% higher: State's share of the net pension liability (asset) 1% Decrease (5.8%) $ 1,627,617,268 Current Rate (6.8%) $ (2,293,804,977) 1% Increase (7.8%) $ (5,116,499,336) State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 113NOTE 15. MILWAUKEE RETIREMENT SYSTEM The Milwaukee Retirement System (MRS) is reported as an Investment Trust Fund. MRS participants provide assets to the State of Wisconsin, Department of Employee Trust Funds (DETF) for investing in the Core Retirement Investment Trust Fund (Core Fund) and the Variable Retirement Investment Trust Fund (Variable Fund) of the Wisconsin Retirement System. Participation of the MRS in the Core Fund and Variable Fund is described in the DETF Administrative Code, Chapter 10.12. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) manages the Core Fund and Variable Fund with oversight by a Board of Trustees as authorized in Wis. Stat. 25.14 and 25.17. SWIB is not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment company. The investments of the Core Fund and Variable Fund consist of a highly diversified portfolio of securities. Wis. Stat. 25.17(3)(a) allows investments in loans, securities and any other investments as authorized by Wis. Stat. 620.22. Permitted classes of investments include bonds of governmental units or of private corporations, loans secured by mortgages, preferred or common stock, real property and other investments not specifically prohibited by statute. Investments are revalued monthly to fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reflected in income. Monthly, the DETF distributes a pro-rata share of the total Core Fund and Variable Fund earnings less administrative expenses to the MRS accounts. The MRS accounts are adjusted to fair value and gains/losses are recorded directly in the accounts per DETF Administrative Code, Chapter 10.12(2). Neither State statute, a legal provision nor a legally binding guarantee exists to support the value of shares.

The OPEB liability, deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources, OPEB expense/(revenue), and fiduciary net position, if any, have been determined on the same basis. Benefit payments (including refunds of employee contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the benefit terms. Investments, if any, are reported at fair value. Retiree Health Insurance Funds The Retiree Health Insurance plans offer group health insurance to retired State of Wisconsin and local government employees. Retirees pay the full premium amount. The State Retiree Health Insurance Fund includes the State, the University of Wisconsin, and other component units of the State. The Local Government Retiree Health Insurance Fund includes 393 local government employers. The plans are not administered through a trust. The Retiree Health Insurance Funds contain certain non-OPEB components relating to post-Medicare pharmacy and health insurance benefits. ETF and the GIB have statutory authority for program administration and oversight under Wisconsin Statutes Chapters 15.165 (2) and 40.03 (6). State of Wisconsin and local government employees participating in the State Health Insurance Plan or the Wisconsin Public Employers Insurance Plan (local government plans) are eligible to continue their health insurance coverage after leaving covered employment. Membership as of December 31, 2021 , included 28,756 former state employees or their beneficiaries and 2,095 former local government employees and beneficiaries. Retirees may choose between several health plans with specific provider networks (i.e., Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's), Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO's) or Medicare Advantage). The health plans must follow GIB guidelines for eligibility and program requirements. All health plans offer a prescribed benefit package called Uniform Benefits and participate in a yearly competitive premium rate bid process. The pharmacy benefit is self-insured by the GIB and administered by Navitus Health Solutions. Effective January 1, 2012, prescription drug coverage for Medicare eligible retirees enrolled in the State group health insurance program is provided by a self-funded Medicare Part D Employer Group Waiver Plan (EGWP). A Medicare \"Wrap\" product is also included to provide full coverage to members, as required by Uniform Benefits, when they reach the Medicare coverage gap, also known as the \"donut hole.\" Retiree Life Insurance Funds The State Retiree Life Insurance Fund includes the State, the University of Wisconsin, and other component units of the State, and is considered a single-employer defined benefit OPEB plan.

Membership as of December 31, 2021 , * Active membership includes disabled Supplemental Health Insurance Conversion Credit (SHICC) Program The SHICC program includes the State, the University of Wisconsin, and other component units of the State and is considered a single-employer defined benefit OPEB plan. The Department of Employee Trust Funds (ETF) and the ETF Board have the authority for program administration and oversight. The SHICC program is reported as an Other Post-Employment Benefit Trust Fund. The SHICC program was established by Wisconsin Statute 40.95 and is defined in the state compensation plan (Wis. Stat. 230.12(9)). The SHICC program allows members with more than 15 years of eligible service to convert unused sick leave balances into credits to pay for post-retirement health insurance premiums. The SHICC benefit provides a limited match of the members credits earned through the Accumulated Sick Leave Conversion Credit (ASLCC) program. ASLCC program credits are computed at the time of retirement, layoff, or death by multiplying the number of hours of unused sick leave by the highest hourly pay rate at which the employee accrued sick leave that is eligible for conversion. Employment category and number of years of service are also factored into the calculation. The SHICC program also includes a provision for the restoration of 500 hours of credits upon retirement, layoff or death provided at least 500 hours or accrued sick leave were used for a single injury or illness during the three years immediately preceding the retirement, layoff or death while in state service. All ASLCC program credits must be used before the SHICC program credits. Unused ASLCC and SHICC credits have no cash value, are carried forward from year to year without interest, State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 116and when total health insurance premiums paid on behalf of the retired employee equal or exceed the conversion credits, no further payments are made under the ASLCC and SHICC programs. ASLCC and SHICC credits may be escrowed indefinitely after retirement for participants who provide evidence of comparable health insurance coverage from another source. Eligibility and Membership Generally to be eligible to use SHICC credits to pay post- retirement health insurance premiums, members with 15 years of adjusted continuous service (or their insured surviving spouse and/or dependents) must be covered under the State of Wisconsin Group Health Insurance Program. If a member with 20 years of service leaves eligible service prior to retirement, the benefit is vested. Membership as of December 31, 2021 , included: Employment Status Count Retirees and Beneficiaries 21,715 Inactive, Non-retired Members 366 Active Members 72,701 Total 94,782 At retirement, the member must have State of Wisconsin Group Health Insurance Program coverage and satisfy the following: Retire on an immediate annuity; or Retire and receive a lump-sum benefit; or Qualify for a Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) disability retirement benefit, long-term disability benefit or a protective occupation duty disability benefit under Wisconsin Statute 40.65; or Have 20 years of WRS creditable service and are eligible for an immediate retirement benefit, but have chosen not to apply for retirement or disability benefit immediately Eligible members may elect to escrow their SHICC credits (to be used at a later date) if they have comparable health insurance coverage through another source. If SHICC eligible members are not immediately eligible for an annuity, they must satisfy the following to defer vested (preserved) SHICC credits to pay health premiums when becoming a WRS annuitant: Terminate with 20 years of WRS creditable service (providing they do not elect a WRS separation benefit) or State constitutional officer, a member or an officer of the legislature of the head of a state department or agency who was appointed by the governor with senate confirmation and are not eligible for an immediate annuity when terminating from state employment (providing they do not elect a WRS separation benefit). If not eligible for an immediate annuity and the member is permanently laid off from State employment, the member must have at least 15 years of adjusted continuous service to use SHICC credits to pay health premiums for up to five years after the layoff begins.Contributions and Benefits The ETF Board approves contribution rates annually, based on recommendations from the actuary. Recommended rates are based on an annual valuation, taking into consideration an estimate of the present value of future benefits and the present value of future contributions, in accordance with Wis. Stat. \u00a7 40.05 (4) (by). Employer contributions made during a member's working lifetime funds a post-retirement benefit. Employers made contributions totaling $15.7 million based upon a percentage of active member earnings for the year ending December 31, 2021 . The SHICC program provides matching sick leave hours, that are in addition to, but generally not to exceed the unused sick leave balances that are used to calculate benefits provided under the ASLCC program, to participants retiring (or terminating employment) with 15 or more years of eligible service, as follows: Employment Category Benefit Eligible Hours* ProtectiveMatch up to 78 hours (9.75 days) per full year of service through 24 years, plus 104 hours (13 days) per full year of service over 24 years. OthersMatch up to 52 hours (6.5 days) per full year of service through 24 years, plus up to 104 hours (13 days) per full year of service over 24 years. *The SHICC program also includes a restoration benefit of up to 500 hours when certain criteria are met. The SHICC program also provides benefits after a member's death. The member's surviving spouse and/or dependents may be eligible to use SHICC credits to pay State of Wisconsin Group Health Insurance premiums under the following conditions: Member was covered by the State of Wisconsin Group Health Insurance Program under a family policy on the member's date of death or the member is receiving a retirement disability benefit; or Member has preserved SHICC credits and the member dies before becoming a WRS annuitant; or Member has escrowed SHICC credits and the member dies.

OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS A.State Retiree Health Insurance OPEB The State Retiree Health Insurance program provides postemployment health insurance coverage to all eligible retired employees of the State, the University of Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority, Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority and Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. The employers do not directly pay any portion of the premium for participating retirees. However, because retirees pay the same premium rate set for active employees, an implicit rate subsidy exists for employers. This implicit rate subsidy is reported as an OPEB liability. At age 65, when eligible, retirees are required to enroll in Medicare. No assets have accumulated because there is no trust. Retiree Health Insurance Plan Description GASB standards classify the State Retiree Health Insurance program as a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan with multiple participating employers. Medical, prescription drug and dental benefits are provided to eligible retirees. Retirees pay the full premium until age 65 directly to the plan either through \"out-of-pocket\" or from unused accumulated sick leave conversion credits or supplemental health insurance conversion credits. The value of the sick leave benefit is defined as compensated absences and reported under the provisions of GASB Statement No. 16, Accounting for Compensated Absences. Contribution requirements are established and may be amended by the GIB. Premiums for non-Medicare retirees are based on an effective rate structure for the health care service provider selected. Monthly rates range from $618 to $1,470 for single coverage and $1,509 to $3,641 for family coverage. As of January 1, 2021 (most recent actuarial valuation date), membership consisted of: Member Type Number Retired members or beneficiaries receiving OPEB benefits 8,219 Vested terminated members not yet receiving OPEB benefits 1,214 Active members 62,805 Total Members 72,238 Inclusion of OPEB Information for Component Units GASB standards require the presentation of OPEB related amounts and information in the State's financial statements for both the State of Wisconsin (the primary government) and the component units. The component units are responsible for their share of the OPEB liabilities. Reported amounts related to the OPEB liability, OPEB expense/(revenue) and related deferred inflows and outflows for the OPEB plans may vary by an immaterial amount from the final amounts due to the timing of available information. Total Retiree Health OPEB Liability The actuarial valuation was based on the plan of retiree benefits and was made for purposes of fulfilling GASB accounting standards which require recognition of the employer cost of postemployment benefits over an employee's career. The total cost of providing postemployment benefits is projected, considering relevant assumptions, then discounted to determine the total OPEB liability. To determine the total OPEB liability for the program, the actuary performed an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2020 and adjusted for changes such as interest earned, contributions paid, and benefits paid through June 30, 2021 . Based on this, the actuary determined the OPEB liability totaled $712.9 million. The total OPEB liability was allocated to participating employers based on their proportionate share of health insurance premiums contributed for active employees.

The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the long- term perspective of the calculations. The total OPEB liability in the January 1, 2021 actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial assumptions and other inputs, applied to all periods included in the measurement unless otherwise specified: Actuarial Valuation Date January 1, 2021 Measurement Date of Total OPEB Liability June 30, 2021 Actuarial cost method Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method N/A Inflation 2.4% Salary increases Separate merit and longevity increase rates by employer and service, plus 3% Discount Rate Discount rate was changed to 2.16% for the June 30, 2021 measurement from 2.21% for the June 30, 2020 measurement Healthcare Cost Trend Rates: Medical 4.10% for the first year then 6.75% grading down 0.25% per year to 4.50% Prescription drug 10.67% for the first year then 7.50% grading down 0.25% per year to 4.50% Dental 0.00% for first two years then 3.00% thereafter Administrative Costs (4.03) % for first year then 3.00% every year after Mortality Rates Wisconsin 2020 Mortality Table Benefit Changes None Participation Rates Active: 60% are assumed to elect coverage at retirement, and 12.5% of the 40% that defer are assumed to be covered over the next 5 years (1.0% per year), so 65% assumed to be covered after 5 years Deferred: 5% per year over 8 years Assumed Claims Per capita claims costs were based on premium equivalent rates for plan year 2021 and actuarial factors applied to weighted average premium rates to estimate costsTermination Rates Rates for General, University, Protective, Executive and Elected employees matched the 2018-2020 experience study for the pension valuation Disability Rates Rates for General, University, Protective, Executive and Elected employees matched the 2018-2020 experience study for the pension valuation Normal Retirement RatesRates for General, University, Protective, Executive and Elected employees matched the 2018-2020 experience study for the pension valuation Lapse Rate 5% per year after the later of assumed commencement or the valuation date Retiree Contribution Increase RateRetiree contributions are expected to increase with average benefit trend Benefit End Date Benefits end when participants turn 65 years old Actuarial assumptions are based on the Wisconsin Retirement System experience study conducted in 2021 using experience from 2018 to 2020. An actuarial experience loss increased the liability by $92.1 million due to demographic changes and actual 2021 contributions and benefit payments that were different form expected. Valuation assumption changes also decreased the liability by $41.2 million as the result of a decrease in obligations due to changes in the participation rate assumptions and the valuation-year per capita health costs based on recent experience, which was offset by an increase in obligations due to updating the healthcare trend rates, adopting updated demographic assumptions based on the WRS Experience Study for the period 2018 - 2020 and lowering the discount rate.

The change in the discount rate was primarily caused by the decrease in the municipal bond rate from 2.12% as of December 31, 2020 to 2.06% as of December 31, 2021. The Plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be insufficient to make all projected future benefit payments of current active and inactive employees. Therefore, the discount rate for calculating the Total OPEB Liability is equal to the single equivalent rate that results in the same actuarial present value as the long-term expected rate of return applied to benefit payments, to the extent that the plan's fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to make projected benefit payments, and the municipal bond rate applied to benefit payments to the extent that the plan's fiduciary net position is projected to be insufficient. The source of the municipal bond rate used is the Bond Buyers GO Index. The plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make projected future benefit payments of current plan members through December 31, 2033. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on plan investments was applied through 2033 and the municipal bond index rate was applied for all remaining periods of projected benefit payments to determine the Total OPEB Liability. Long-term expected Return on Plan Assets The long-term expected rate of return is determined by adding expected inflation to expected long-term real returns and reflecting expected volatility and correlation. Investments for the retiree life insurance plans are held with Securian, the insurance carrier. Interest is calculated and credited to the plans based on the rate of return for a segment of the insurance carriers' general fund, specifically 10-year A- Bonds (as a proxy, and not tied to any specific investments). The overall aggregate interest rate is calculated using a tiered approach based on the year the funds were originally invested and the rate of return for that year. Investment interest is credited based on the aggregate rate of return and assets are not adjusted to fair market value. Furthermore, the insurance carrier guarantees the principal amounts of the reserves, including all interest previously credited thereto.

This single discount rate was based on the expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments of 6.8%. The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that employer contributions will be made at rates equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate. Based on these assumptions, the OPEB plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the Total OPEB Liability and projections were excluded from this report. Long-term expected Return on Plan Assets The assets of the SHICC are commingled with assets from other benefit programs and invested in the Core Retirement Investment Trust (Core Fund). Earnings are allocated between the benefit programs based on the average balance invested for each program. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) manages the Core Fund with oversight by the SWIB Board of Trustees, as authorized in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 25.17. The long-term expected rate of return is reviewed every three years in conjunction with the Wisconsin Retirement System experience study. Best estimates of geometric real rates of return of each major asset class included in the OPEB plan's target allocation as of December 31, 2021, are summarized in the following table: Asset ClassTarget AllocationLong-Term Expected Geometric Real Rate of Return Global Equities 52.0 % 4.2 % Fixed Income 25.0 % 1.8 % Inflation Sensitive Assets 19.0 % 0.2 % Real Estate 7.0 % 3.0 % Private Equity/Debt 12.0 % 7.0 % Cash (15.0) % 0.9 % Total Fund 100.0 % 4.0 % Inflation 2.4 % Long-Term Expected Rate of Return 6.8 % The long-term expected rate of return is 6.8% which is a decrease from 7.0% from the prior year. The long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of OPEB plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. Actuarial assumptions Actuarial assumptions are based on the Wisconsin Retirement System experience study conducted in 2021 using experience from 2018 to 2020. The total OPEB liability in the December 31, 2021 actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement: Actuarial Valuation Date: December 31, 2021 Measurement Date of Net OPEB Liability/(Asset):December 31, 2021 Experience Study January 1, 2018 - December 31, 2020 Published November 18, 2021 Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Long-Term Expected Rate of Return: WRS Experience Mortality Table Health Care Cost Trend Rate:6.0% for the first year grading down to an ultimate health care trend rate of 3.5% over a 12 year period. Health Care Premiums Actual premium amounts are used for current annuitants. For all non annuitants (active, preserved, and escrowed members), average premiums are calculated based on non Medicare and Medicare rates for one person and two person coverages. Participation 100% of active and preserved members will begin using sick leave credits immediately upon reaching eligibility. Usage for Escrowed Benefits: 50% of members currently in escrow status will at some point begin using their sick leave balances to pay for health care costs. Sick Leave Accumulation: The assumed annual sick leave accumulation for each individual is at their same rate as in the past (earned less used), but not more than 100% of the gross earned rate based on the person's employer and not less than 25% of their gross earned rate. The assumed annual gross earned rates range from 6.4 to 16.25 days depending on the employer. OPEB plan fiduciary net position.

PUBLIC ENTITY RISK POOLS ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYEE TRUST FUNDS The Department of Employee Trust Funds operates three public entity risk pools: group health insurance, group income continuation insurance and duty disability insurance. ETF's separately issued financial statements, which contain historical trend, revenue, and claims development information, are available at www.etf.wi.gov and on request from: Wisconsin Department of Employee Trust Funds PO Box 7931 Madison, WI 53707-7931 1-877-533-5020 The information provided in this note applies to the period ending December 31, 2021 . A.Description of Funds The Health Insurance Fund offers group health insurance for current employees of the State government and of participating local public employers. All public employers in the State are eligible to participate. The State and 393 local employers currently participate. The State and local government portions of the fund are accounted for separately and have separate contribution rates, benefits, and actuarial valuations. The fund includes both a self- insured, fee-for-service plan as well as various prepaid plans, primarily Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's), a self- insured plan that provides for pharmacy benefits of covered members and a self-insured dental plan that provides dental benefits for members selecting dental insurance. The Income Continuation Insurance Fund offers both long-term and short-term disability benefits (up to 75% of the average monthly earnings) for current employees of the State and of participating local public employers. All public employers in the State are eligible to participate. The State and 278 local employers currently participate in the plan and it is self-insured. The State and local government portions of the fund are accounted for separately and have separate contribution rates, benefits, and actuarial valuations. Since March 2012, premiums have been suspended for the local employers as a result of the funded status of the local employer program. The Duty Disability Fund offers special disability insurance for the State and local WRS participants in protective occupations. Participation in the program is mandatory for all WRS employers with protective occupation employees. The State and 500 local employers currently participate. The plan is self-insured, and the risk is shared between the State and local government employers in the plan. Contributions are actuarially determined and are employer paid. Contributions are based on a graduated, experience-rated formula. During 2021, contribution rates ranged from 0.09% to 2.24% of covered payroll based on employer experience.B.Accounting Policies for Risk Pools Basis of Accounting - All Public Entity Risk Pools are accounted for in enterprise funds using the full accrual basis of accounting and the flow of economic resources measurement focus. Valuation of Investments - Assets of the Health Insurance, Income Continuation Insurance and Duty Disability Insurance funds are invested in the Core Retirement Investment Trust. Investments are valued at fair value. Unpaid Claims Liabilities - Claims liabilities are based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that have been reported but not settled, and of claims that have been incurred but not reported. The estimate includes the effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors. Adjustments to claims liabilities are charged or credited to expense in the periods in which they are made. Unpaid claims liability is presented at face value and is not discounted for health insurance. It is discounted using an interest rate of 6.8 percent for income continuation and duty disability insurance, as face value of the liability for these programs is not available. The liabilities for income continuation, duty disability, and health insurance were determined by actuarial methods. Administrative Expenses - All maintenance expenses are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Acquisition costs are immaterial and are treated as maintenance expenses. Reinsurance - Health insurance plans provided by HMO's and health insurance for local government annuitants are fully insured by outside insurers. All remaining risk is self-insured with no reinsurance coverage. Risk Transfer - Participating employers are not subject to supplemental assessments in the event of deficiencies. If the assets of the fund were exhausted, participating employers would not be responsible for the fund's liabilities. Premium Setting - Premiums are established by the GIB (Health Insurance and ICI) and ETF Board for Duty Disability in consultation with actuaries. Statutory Authority - All programs are operated under the authority of Chapter 40, Wisconsin Statutes.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 128C.Unpaid Claims Liabilities As discussed in Section B of this Note, each fund establishes a liability for both reported and unreported insured events, which is an estimate of future payments of losses.

Total unpaid claims at the end of 2020 is $33.7 million in rebates due from pharmaceutical companies.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 129NOTE 19. SELF-INSURANCE It is the general policy of the State not to purchase commercial insurance for the risks of losses to which it is exposed. Instead, the State believes it is more economical to manage its risks internally and set aside assets for claim settlement in its internal service fund, the Risk Management Fund. The fund services most claims for risk of loss to which the State is exposed, including damage to State owned property, liability for property damages and injuries to third parties, and worker's compensation. All funds and agencies of the State participate in the Risk Management Fund. State Property Damage Property damages to State-owned properties are covered by the State's self-funded property program up to $4.0 million per occurrence and $6.5 million annual aggregate. When claims, which exceed $100,000 per occurrence, total $6.5 million, the State's private insurance becomes available. Losses to property occurring after the annual aggregate are first subject to a $100,000 deductible. The amount of loss in excess of $100,000 is covered by the State's private insurance company. During Fiscal Year 2022 , the excess insurance limits were written to $500 million. The liabilities for State property damage are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. The estimate for future benefits and loss liabilities is based on the reserves on open claims and paid claims. Losses incurred but not reported are expected to be immaterial. Claims incurred but not paid as of June 30, 2022 are estimated to total $12.7 million. Property Damages and Bodily Injuries to Third Parties The State is self-funded for third party liability and effective 7/1/20 retains $5.0 million per occurrence and participates in a 1/6th quota share for the next $6 million excess of the $5 million per occurrence retention. Additional layers of excess insurance are in place above $11 million, with total policy limits during Fiscal Year 2022 at $49.0 million. The liabilities for property damages and injuries to third parties are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. The estimate for future benefits and loss liabilities for the prior fiscal year was the reserves on open claims. The estimate for future benefits and loss liabilities is calculated by an actuary based on the reserves on open claims and prior experience. No liability is reported for environmental impairment liability claims either incurred or incurred but not reported because existing case law makes it unlikely the State would be held liable for material amounts. Because actual claims liabilities depend upon complex factors such as inflation, changes in legal doctrines, and damage awards, the process used in computing claims liability does not necessarily result in an exact amount. Immaterial non-incremental claims adjustment expenses are not included as part of the liability. Claims incurred but not paid as of June 30, 2022 are estimated to total $56.2 million. Worker's Compensation The Worker's Compensation Program was created by Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 102 to provide benefits to workers injured on the job. All employees of the State are included in the program. An injury is covered under worker's compensation if it is caused by an accident that arose out of and in the course of employment. The responsibility for claiming compensation is on the employee. A claim must be filed with the program within two years from the date of injury; otherwise the claim is not allowable. The worker's compensation liability has been determined by an actuary using paid claims and current claims reserves. Liabilities include an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported. Because actual claims liabilities are affected by external factors, the process used in computing claims liabilities does not necessarily result in an exact amount. Claims incurred but not paid as of June 30, 2022 are estimated to total $87.0 million. Changes in the balances of claims liability for the Risk Management Fund during the current and prior fiscal years are as follows (in thousands): 2022 2021 Beginning of fiscal year liability $ 146,478 $ 128,242 Current year claims and changes in estimates 40,443 52,533 year-end $ 152,922 $ 146,478 Settlements have not exceeded coverages for each of the past three fiscal years. Annuity Contracts The Risk Management Fund purchased annuity contracts in various claimants' names to satisfy claim liabilities. The likelihood that the fund will be required to make future payments on those claims is remote and, therefore, the fund is considered to have satisfied its primary liability to the claimants. Accordingly, the annuity contracts are not reported in, and the related liabilities are removed from, the fund's balance sheet. The aggregate outstanding amount of liabilities removed from the financial statements at June 30, 2022 is $4.7 million.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 130NOTE 20. INSURANCE FUNDS A.Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund The Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund was created in 1975 for the purpose of providing excess medical malpractice coverage for claims exceeding the legal primary insurance limits prescribed in Wis. Stat. Section 655.23(4), or the maximum liability limit for which the health care provider is insured, whichever limit is greater. Management of the Fund is vested with a 13-member Board of Governors, which is chaired by the Commissioner of Insurance. Most health care providers permanently practicing or operating in the State of Wisconsin are required to pay Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund assessment fees. Risk of loss is retained by the Fund. The Board of Governors authorized a premium holiday beginning in the fiscal year 2021 and extended the holiday through fiscal year 2022. Also during fiscal year 2021, the Board approved an investment portfolio automatic rebalancing policy, changing the threshold from 20 percent to 17.5 percent. The Future Benefits and Loss Liability account includes individual case estimates for reported losses and estimates for incurred but not reported losses based upon the projected ultimate losses recommended by a consulting actuary. The liability for incurred but not reported losses as of June 30, 2022 , is determined by deducting individual case estimates of the liability for reported losses and net losses paid from inception of the Fund, and adding a risk margin to the projected ultimate loss liabilities, as follows (in thousands): Projected ultimate loss liability $ 1,238,455 Less: Net loss paid from inception (944,398) Less: Liability for reported losses (171,174) Risk Margin 73,514 Liability for incurred but not reported losses $ 196,397 The Future Benefits and Loss Liability account also includes an estimate of the loss adjustment expense (LAE). Using the data available through September 30 of the fiscal year, the actuary estimated the liability for LAE as 18 percent of the estimated unpaid losses as of June 30, 2022. The percentage used in the financial statements was different, since the actuary's estimate was adjusted to reflect actual LAE payments. Specifically, the loss adjustment expenses paid from the inception of the Fund through June 30, 2022, are deducted from the projected ultimate LAE to determine the liability for LAE as June 30, 2022 as follows (in thousands): Projected ultimate LAE liability $ 167,816 Less: LAE paid from inception (115,215) Risk Margin 13,150 Liability for LAE $ 65,751 In accordance with Section Ins. 17.27(3), Wis. Adm. Code, the liability for reported losses, liability for incurred but not reported losses, and liability for loss adjustment expense are maintained on a present value basis with the difference from full value being reported as a contra account to these estimated loss liabilities. These estimated loss liabilities are discounted only to the extent that they are matched by cash and invested assets. Using the actuarially determined discount factor of 0.928, which is based on an investment yield assumption of 2.0 percent approved by the Board of Governors, the discounted loss liability would be as follows as of June 30, 2022 (in thousands): Estimated liability for incurred but not reported losses $ 196,397 Estimated liability for reported losses 171,174 Estimated liability for loss adjustment expense 65,751 Total estimated loss liabilities 433,322 Less: Amount representing interest (31,176) Discounted loss liabilities $ 402,146 Included in the above estimates of loss liabilities, both undiscounted and discounted, is a 25 percent risk margin, which was recommended by the actuary and approved by the Board of Governors. The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance contracts for periodic actuarial audits of the Fund. This audit includes a review by another actuary of the reasonableness of the actuarial methodology and assumptions used in developing estimates of the Fund's liabilities. The actuarial audits have concluded that the Fund's loss liability estimates are reasonable, although conservative. The Fund's contracted actuary has considered the recommendations made in the actuarial audits and appropriately incorporated any necessary changes based on those recommendations into the actuarial methodology and assumptions used to calculate the Fiscal Year 2022 liabilities estimate. In addition to discounted loss liabilities, the Future Benefit and Loss Liabilities account also includes a future medical expenses liability and a contributions being held liability. The future medical expenses liability consists of those accounts required by Wis. Stat. Sec. 655.015 to be established if a settlement or judgment provides for future medical expense payments in excess of $100,000. The accounts are managed by the Fund and earn a proportionate share of the Fund's interest. Any account balance remaining when a claimant dies reverts back to the Fund. The contributions being held liability consists of nonrefundable payments, generally in amounts equal to the primary coverage in effect for related claims, that primary insurers have voluntarily presented to the Fund and which are negotiable with the Fund in exchange for a release of payment for any future defense costs that may be incurred on the claim. This amount is held as a liability to the Fund until a payment on the claim is made. The breakdown of Future Benefit and Loss Liabilities, including the portions that are estimated as current and noncurrent as of June 30, 2022 (in thousands), is as follows: Discounted loss liabilities $ 402,146 Future medical expense liability 61,707 Total estimated loss liabilities 463,853 Current portion (56,039) Noncurrent portion $ 407,814 The uncertainties inherent in projecting the frequency and severity of large claims because of the Injured Patients and Families State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 131Compensation Fund's unlimited liability coverage and extended reporting and settlement periods makes it likely that the amounts ultimately paid will differ from the recorded estimated loss liabilities. These differences cannot be quantified. The estimated amounts included in the balance of Future Benefits and Loss Liabilities are continually reviewed and adjusted as the Fund gains additional experience. Such adjustments are reflected in current operations. Because of the changes in these estimates, the benefit expense for the fiscal year is not necessarily indicative of the loss experience for the year. The following is a reconciliation of the change in the balance of Future Benefits and Loss Liabilities during Fiscal Year 2022 (in thousands): Liability at the beginning of the year $ 428,807 Incurred claims and related expenses for the current year and the change in estimated amounts for claims incurred in prior years 45,015 Less: current year payments attributable to claims incurred in current and prior years (9,968) Liability at the end of the year $ 463,854 B. State Life Insurance Fund The State Life Insurance Fund was created under Chapter 607, Wisconsin Statutes, to offer life insurance to residents of Wisconsin in a manner similar to private insurers. This fund functions much like a mutual life insurance company and is subject to the same regulatory requirements as any life insurance company licensed to operate in Wisconsin. Premiums are reported as earned when due. Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the life of the contracts. This association is accomplished by means of the provision for liabilities for future benefits and the amortization of acquisition costs. The State Life Insurance Fund does not pay commissions nor does it incur agent expenses. Future benefits and loss liabilities have been computed by the net level premium method based upon estimated future investment yield and mortality. The composition of liabilities and the more material assumptions pertinent thereto are presented below (in thousands):Issue YearOrdinary Life Insurance in ForceAmount of of Assumption YearInterest Rate Mortality CSO, ALB, Aggregate * Age Next Birthday All of the State Life Insurance Fund's life insurance in force is participating. This Fund is required by statute to maintain surplus at a level between 7 percent and 10 percent of statutorily admitted assets as far as practicably possible. All excess surplus is to be returned to the policyholders in the form of policyholder dividends. Policyholder dividends are declared each year in order to achieve the required level of surplus. The statutory assets at December 31, 202 1 were $112.9 million and statutory capital and surplus was $10.5 million. Fund equity at June 30, 2022 was $11.6 million.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 132NOTE 21. SEGMENT INFORMATION AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL DATA Primary Government The State issues revenue bonds as a component of the total funding for the Direct Loan Portfolio, which is accounted for as part of the Environmental Improvement Fund. The Direct Loan Portfolio is also funded by grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\"). Loans in this portfolio are made for water and wastewater projects. Repayments from loans in this portfolio, grants and revenue bond proceeds are used to fund new loans. The Environmental Improvement Fund has pledged future loan revenues, net of specified operating expenses, to repay outstanding revenue bonds. Investors in these revenue bonds rely solely on the revenues generated from the loans within the Direct Loan Portfolio.

The State accrues liabilities related to legal proceedings, if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Such losses, totaling $0.6 million on June 30, 2022 reported in the governmental activities, are discussed below: The Work Injury Supplemental Benefit Fund, administered by the Department of Workforce Development, provides compensatory payments to survivors of fatally injured employees or disabled employees with work-related injuries. The liability for annuities to be paid totaled $0.6 million at June 30, 2022 . Other Claims, Judgments, and Contingencies The State is also named as a party in other legal proceedings where the ultimate disposition and consequence are not presently determinable. The potential loss amount relating to an unfavorable outcome for certain of these proceedings could not be reasonably determined at this time. However, the ultimate dispositions and consequences of any single legal proceeding or all legal proceedings collectively should not have a material adverse effect on the State's financial position. In August 2018, the Department of Health Services (DHS) received notification from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommending a $27.6 million disallowance related to the Medicaid program. DHHS concluded DHS did not refund the full federal share of Medicaid-related settlements and judgements from October 2008 through September 2016. DHS partially disagreed with the report. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reviewed the report and determined that DHHS underreported the settlement and requested that DHS refund $31.0 million to the federal government. In February 2021 DHS submitted a formal objection letter to CMS and in August 2022 CMS issued a disallowance in the amount of $24.9 million. DHS intends to appeal this disallowance. St. Mary's Springs Academy filed a just compensation appeal against the Department of Transportation (DOT). The issue is the amount of compensation to St. Mary's Springs Academy for property acquisition as part of a highway project. Depending on the verdict, DOT may be liable for additional damages and attorney's fees. It is believed that the maximum total liability would be approximately $1.8 million because of damages already paid by DOT. It is the State's position that it is not liable for any new compensation or fees and costs of St. Mary's. The State is vigorously defending this case, with mediation scheduled for December 2022 and a trial scheduled for March 2023. KJS Amoco Inc. filed a civil lawsuit against DOT for relocation benefits due to commercial displacement following DOT's total acquisition of leased property. The plaintiff is seeking payment of approximately $11.4 million. DOT successfully obtained dismissal of a second plaintiff and the claims of that plaintiff. Cross motions for summary judgement on the remaining claim have been filed and are in the process of being briefed, with a trial date not yet scheduled. It is the State's position that it is not liable for this claim and is vigorously defending this case. At the end of FY 2022, the Unemployment Reserve Fund, administered by the Department of Workforce Development (DWD), had a backlog related to weekly claims filed. DWD accrued a liability in the Unemployment Reserve Fund for benefits paid through October 31, 2022 that were related to weeks prior to June 30, 2022. However, an estimate of payments related to the remaining backlog, totaling 5,926 adjudication issues and 1,369 appeals as of October 30, 2022, cannot be estimated and therefore a liability for these claims has not been reported. A class action lawsuit alleging discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA as well violation of the \"when due\" clause of the Social Security Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was filed against the DWD in September 2021. The plaintiffs seek to invalidate Wis Stat. 108.04(12)(f) and 108.04(2)(h) which prohibit recipients of social security disability insurance payments from receiving regular unemployment compensation benefits. In addition to an injunction, the plaintiffs seek back payments for any weeks that members of the class would have been eligible for regular unemployment benefits, excluding the weeks for which they received PUA instead, and reimbursement for any collection costs and penalties. The case was pled as a class action, but the State successfully moved for an order allowing the district court to rule on a summary judgement motion first. That summary judgement motion is now pending, which seeks complete dismissal of the case. Several employees of the Department of Corrections (DOC) filed a Wis. Stat. Chapter 109 wage claim action against DOC seeking unpaid wages for tasks they claim are integral and indispensable to their primary work duties. The plaintiffs are seeking class action certification, which was granted in September 2022 by the circuit court. DOJ has appealed the decision certifying the class, with an opening brief due in December 2022. The State is vigorously defending its position. In FY 2020, Intersystems Corporation filed a claim against the Department of Revenue (DOR) asserting that DOR owed Intersystems Corporation a refund of $73.9 million plus interest for 2010-2017. The issue is whether or not fees from sublicensing software sold to Epic, who is domiciled in Wisconsin, may be treated as Wisconsin sales in the sales factor. The case is currently being appealed to the Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission, but DOR believes that its position is meritorious and will defend the matter vigorously. In FY 2022, Caidan Enterprises Incorporated filed a claim against DOR asserting that DOR owed Caidan approximately $15.0 million in income tax and interest for the 2015-2018 tax years because Caidan should not pay taxes on gain that was not unitary. The case is currently being appealed to the Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission, but DOR believes the gain was not unitary and will defend the matter vigorously. B. Commitments Primary Government As of June 30, 2022 , encumbrances of the General Fund totaled $1.9 billion, encumbrances of the Transportation Fund totaled $2.1 billion, and encumbrances of other non-major governmental funds totaled $216.2 million. Obligations at June 30, 2022 representing multi-year, long-term commitments included (in thousands):State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 137Transportation Fund $ 565,961 Capital Improvement Fund - WisDOT Harbors, Rails and Highway Programs 30,515 Transportation Revenue Bonds Capital Projects Fund 30,770 General Fund - Housing Programs 81,987 The Environmental Improvement Fund (the Fund) was established to administer the Clean Water Fund Loan Program. Loans and grants are made to local units of government for wastewater treatment projects for terms of up to 20 years. Loans are made at a number of prescribed interest rates based on environmental priority. The loans contractually are revenue obligations or general obligations of the local governmental units. Additionally, various statutory provisions exist which provide further security for payment. The Fund has made financial assistance commitments of $257.6 million as of June 30, 2022 . These loan and grant commitments are expected to be met through proceeds from issuance of revenue obligations and additional federal grants. The Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund may be required to purchase an annuity as a result of a claim settlement. Under specific annuity arrangements, the Fund may have ultimate responsibility for annuity payments if the annuity company defaults on annuity payments. The total estimated replacement value of the Fund's annuities as of June 30, 2022 was $32.8 million. The replacement value calculation includes only annuities where the Fund remains the owner. Annuities with qualified assignments are no longer included. The Fund reserves the right to pursue collection from State guarantee funds. State Public Deposit Guarantee - As required by Wis. Stat. Sec. 34.08, the State is to make payments to public depositors for proofs of loss (e.g., loss resulting from a bank failure) up to $400 thousand per depositor above the amount of federal insurance. This statutory requirement guarantees that the State will make payments in favor of the public depositor that has submitted a proof of loss. Payments would be made in the order in which satisfactory proofs of loss are received by the State's Department of Financial Institutions, until the designated appropriation is exhausted. At June 30, 2022 , the appropriation available totaled $75.4 million. Losses become fixed as of the date of the loss. A public depositor experiencing a loss must assign its interest in the deposit, to the extent of the amount paid, to the Department of Financial Institutions. Any recovery made by the Department of Financial Institutions under the assignment is to be repaid to the appropriation. The possibility of a material loss resulting from payments to and recovery from public depositors is remote.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 138NOTE 25. TAX ABATEMENTS Wisconsin statutes authorize tax abatements to encourage economic development and other actions beneficial to the State or its citizens resulting in a reduction in tax revenue the State would otherwise be entitled to collect. GASB Statement No. 77, Tax Abatement Disclosures , requires disclosure of tax abatement agreements entered into by a reporting government, along with agreements entered into by other governments, which reduce the reporting government's tax revenues. Most tax abatement programs meeting the criteria for disclosure in the State's ACFR are certified by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), a separate legal entity also reported as a component unit in the ACFR. WEDC enters into the abatement agreements and administers the programs. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) is responsible for ensuring the certified tax abatements were properly applied when processing income tax returns filed by recipients.

The Act also recognized a moral obligation in which the legislature expresses its expectation and aspiration, if ever called upon to do so, to make an appropriation to pay no more than 40 percent of the principal and interest of a local governmental unit's municipal obligations used to finance costs related to the zone.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 141NOTE 26. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Primary Government Long-term Debt General Obligation Bonds - In February 2022, the State entered into a forward delivery bond purchase agreement for the issuance of general obligation refunding bonds and a preliminary closing for those bonds occurred in March 2022. Subject to the forward delivery agreement, the State expects to issue $125.8 million of 2023 Series 1 general obligation refunding bonds in January 2023 to be used for the current refunding of certain principal of previously issued general obligation bonds. When issued, the interest rates are expected to be 5.0 percent payable semiannually beginning November 1, 2023. The bonds mature May 1, 2024, May 1, 2027, and May 1, 2028. In July 2022, the State issued $134.8 million of 2022 Series A general obligation floating rate notes to be used for the acquisition, construction, development, extension, enlargement or improvement of land, water, property, highways, buildings, equipment of facilities for public purposes. The interest rates associated with these notes are variable rate with interest payable monthly beginning August 1, 2022. The notes mature May 1, 2023 and May 1, 2025. In October 2022, the State issued $54.1 million of 2022 Series 3 general obligation refunding bonds to be used for the current refunding of certain principal of previously issued general obligation bonds. The interest rate associated with these bonds was set at 5.0 percent payable May 1, and November 1, 2023. The bonds mature November 1, 2023. In November 2022, the State issued $257.1 million of 2022 Series 4 general obligation refunding bonds to be used for the current and advance refunding of certain principal of previously issued general obligation bonds. The interest rates associated with these bonds were set at 5.0 percent payable semiannually beginning May 1 2023. The bonds mature annually beginning May 1, 2025 through May 1, 2043. In November 2022, the State issued $20.6 million of 2022 Series 5 general obligation refunding bonds (taxable) to be used for the advance refunding of certain principal of previously issued general obligation bonds. The interest rates associated with these bonds were set at 4.8 percent to 5.7 percent payable semiannually beginning May 1, 2023. The bonds mature May 1, 2027, May 1, 2028, May 1, 2031, and then annually beginning May 1, 2033 through May 1, 2037. Environmental Improvement Fund Revenue Bonds - In November 2022, the State issued $50.0 million of 2022 Series A environmental improvement fund revenue bonds (green bonds) to make pledged loans for the program. The interest rates associated with these bonds were set at 5.0 percent payable semiannually beginning June 1, 2023. The bonds mature annually beginning June 1, 2024 through June 1, 2043. Short-term Debt General Obligation Notes - In August 2022, the State issued $73.5 million of general obligation extendible municipal commercial paper notes to be used to finance, or to fund previously issued general obligation extendible municipal commercial paper notes.Investments In December 2022, the State became aware that one of its limited partnership investments, the Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT), had received repurchase requests in the third quarter of 2022 that exceeded the 2% of NAV monthly redemption limit and 5% of NAV quarterly limitation for the fund. Consequently, BREIT repurchased approximately 43% of each investor's repurchase request in November 2022. In December 2022, redemption restrictions were implemented and only 0.3% of the fund NAV will be eligible for repurchase. If BREIT receives elevated repurchase requests in the first quarter of 2023, Blackstone intends to fulfill repurchases at the 2% of NAV monthly limit, subject to the 5% of NAV quarterly limit. As of June 30th, 2022, the Common School Fund had approximately $66.0 million invested in BREIT. In August 2022, the Common School Fund redeemed approximately $10.0 million of shares in BREIT. The Common School Fund has no intention of selling additional shares of BREIT at this time.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 142This page left intentionally blank.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 143Required Supplementary Information For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 144Postemployment Benefits - State Health Insurance Program Schedule of Changes to the Total OPEB Liability and Related Ratios (in millions) As of the Measurement Date June 30 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Total OPEB Liability: Service cost $ 72.1 $ 58.0 $ 40.3 $ 48.5 $ 52.5 Interest 23.6 27.1 21.7 24.5 14.9 Difference between expected & actual experience (4.1) 0.8 65.1 (40.1) 92.1 Changes of assumptions (109.3) (224.8) 56.7 (16.6) (41.2) Benefit payments (38.4) (40.8) (40.9) Net Change in Total OPEB Liability (56.1) (179.7) 142.9 682.5 682.5 642.0 $ 4,030.8 $ 4,107.0 Total OPEB Liability as a percentage of covered-employee payroll 19.49 % 14.47 % 17.47 % 15.93 % 17.36 % GASB standards require the presentation of 10 years of information.

Under the modified approach, infrastructure assets are not depreciated as long as the State can demonstrate that these assets are properly managed and are being preserved at or above an established condition level. Instead of depreciation, the costs to maintain and preserve infrastructure assets are expensed, while additions and improvements are capitalized. The State owns approximately 11,200 centerline miles of road and 5,100 bridges. Road Network Condition assessments are completed on a two-year cycle with the most current results reported for each State road. The State completes the assessment of the Eastern half of the State in one year and the Western half of the State in the next. Numerous measures are used to assess the condition of the State's road network. The State has adopted the International Roughness Index (IRI), as defined by the Federal Highway Administration, as one of its condition measures. IRI is a direct measure of road roughness, with an IRI of 2.69 mm/m (170 inches/mile) or greater being defined as a \"poor\" ride. Roads with a \"poor\" IRI assessment may cause negative impacts for the traveling public by decreasing driver comfort and potentially increasing the damage to vehicles and goods. It is the State's policy to ensure no more than 15 percent of its roads receive a \"poor\" IRI assessment. Recent condition assessment results are as follows: Year Ended June 30Miles of 11,200 7.3 15.0 7.7 8.3 15.0 6.7 2013 11,200 6.2 15.0 8.8Each year the State estimates the costs to maintain and preserve the road network at, or above, the established condition level. Actual maintenance/preservation costs compare to estimates as follows: Year Ended June 30Estimated Costs (In millions)Actual Costs (In millions)Variance (In millions) 2013 580.9 561.8 19.1 Estimated costs are developed at the beginning of the fiscal year based on projects planned for the current and future years. The types of projects ultimately contracted and incurring costs during the year are often very different. In addition, the State of Wisconsin, Department of Transportation's multi-year contracting process, allowing encumbrances to carry forward, makes a comparison of actual to estimated amounts difficult since expenditures for the current year may have been budgeted and committed to a project in prior years. Bridge Network Condition assessments are completed on a two-year cycle, with more frequent inspections completed if warranted. The most current assessment results are reported for each State bridge, making the overall assessment a blend of measures completed in the current fiscal year and those completed in the prior year. The structural condition rating is a broad measure of the condition of a bridge. Each bridge is rated using three National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition codes and two NBI appraisal ratings. The three NBI condition codes are Deck Condition, Superstructure Condition, and Substructure Condition. The two NBI appraisal ratings are Structural Evaluation and Waterway Adequacy. The NBI uses a 10-point scale for condition codes and appraisal ratings. A bridge is considered \"structurally deficient\" if any condition code is 4 or less, or if either appraisal code is 2 or less.State of Wisconsin Required Supplementary Information For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 150\"Structurally deficient\" bridges cause negative impacts for the public by increasing the likelihood that heavy loads will need to be rerouted to less efficient routes, thus increasing logistic costs for State businesses. It is the State's policy to ensure no more than 15 percent of its bridges are \"structurally deficient\". Recent condition assessment results are as follows: Year Ended June 30Number of BridgesPercent Structurally 15.0 2021 5,100 2.3 15.0 12.7 2020 5,200 2.3 15.0 12.7 2019 5,200 2.6 15.0 12.4 2018 5,200 3.0 15.0 12.0 2017 5,200 3.1 15.0 11.9 2016 5,200 3.1 15.0 11.9 2015 5,200 3.2 15.0 11.8 2014 5,100 3.3 15.0 11.7 2013 5,100 3.1 15.0 11.9 Each year, the State estimates the costs to maintain and preserve the bridge network at, or above, the established condition level.

The State of Wisconsin, Department of Transportation's multi-year contracting process, allowing encumbrances to carry forward, makes a comparison of actual to estimated amounts difficult since expenditures for the current year may have been budgeted and committed to a project in prior years. Estimated and actual costs for 2014 have been restated from amounts reported in prior years due to an error in classification of costs on a capital project as maintenance/ preservation costs.State of Wisconsin Required Supplementary Information For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 151This page left intentionally blank.State of Wisconsin Required Supplementary Information For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 152Budgetary Comparison Schedule - General Fund For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 (In Thousands) Original BudgetFinal BudgetActual Amounts Unexpended Budgetary Fund Balances, Beginning of Year $ 5,308,758 Revenues and Transfers (Inflows): Taxes $ 17,916,777 $ 18,957,509 20,578,238 Departmental: Tribal Gaming \u2014 \u2014 27,555,746 (A) 27,553,052 (A) 27,498,447 Transfers from: Nonmajor Governmental Funds (A) (A) 1,939 Nonmajor Enterprise Funds (A) (A) \u2014 Total Revenues and Transfers (Inflows) $ 45,472,523 $ 46,510,561 $ 48,078,624 Amounts Available for Appropriation Transportation \u2014 \u2014 15,683 Nonmajor Enterprise Funds \u2014 \u2014 249,666 Total Appropriations (Outflows) $ 37,884,756 $ 52,885,142 $ 44,485,308 Fund Balances, End of Year 8,902,074 Less Encumbrances Outstanding at June 30, 2022 (2,300,737) Fund Balances, End of Year - Budgetary Basis 6,601,337 Reconciliation of the End of Year, Budgetary Basis, Fund Balance to the Detail Reported in the Annual Fiscal Report: General Purpose: Designated $ 677,779 Undesignated 4,298,919 Total General Purpose 4,976,698 Program Revenue 1,624,639 Fund Balances, End of Year Budgetary Basis $ 6,601,337 (A) Interfund transfers to the General Fund were budgeted under departmental revenue during Fiscal Year 2022 .State of Wisconsin 153Budgetary Comparison Schedule - Transportation Fund For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 (In Thousands) Original BudgetFinal BudgetActual Amounts Unexpended Budgetary Fund Balances, Beginning of Year $ 845,610 Revenues (Inflows): Taxes $ 3,417,551 3,417,551 Amounts Available for Appropriation 4,263,161 Appropriations and Resources 3,238,105 6,894,649 3,120,983 General Executive Other General 23,468 25,179 23,766 Total Appropriations and Transfers (Outflows) $ 3,263,708 $ 6,921,963 3,146,504 Fund Balances, End of Year 1,116,657 Less Encumbrances Outstanding at June 30, 2022 (2,220,641) Fund Balances, End of Year Budgetary Basis $ (1,103,984) State of Wisconsin 154155NOTE 1. BUDGETARY INFORMATION A. Budgetary - GAAP Reporting Reconciliation The accompanying Budgetary Comparison Schedule compares the legally adopted budget (more fully described in RSI Note 1-B) with actual data on a budgetary basis.

The final budget is primarily a general purpose revenue and expenditure budget. General purpose revenues consist of general taxes and miscellaneous receipts which are paid into the General Fund, lose their identity, and are then available for appropriation by the Legislature. The remaining revenues consist of program revenues, which are credited by law to an appropriation to finance a specified program or State agency, and segregated revenues which are paid into separate identifiable funds. While State departments and agencies are required to submit estimates of expected revenues for program revenue and segregated revenue categories, these estimates are not formally incorporated into the adopted budget except for revenue estimates of the Lottery Fund. As a result, legally budgeted revenues for these categories are not available and, consequently, actual amounts are reported in the budget column of the Budgetary Comparison Schedules. Expenditure budgeting differs for the various types of appropriations. For most appropriations, budgeted expenditures equal the amount from the adopted budget plus any subsequent legislative or administrative revisions. Various supplemental appropriations were approved during the year and have been incorporated into the budget figures. While State statutes prohibit spending beyond budgetary authority, a provision is made to include the value of accounts receivable, inventories and work in process in identifying available revenues. The State also utilizes nonbudget accounts for which no budget is established but expenditures may be incurred. As a result, actual expenditures may exceed budgeted amounts in certain categories. The budgetary basis of accounting required by State law differs materially from the basis used to report revenues and expenditures in accordance with GAAP. Other variances arise because the State's biennial budget is developed according to the statutorily required fund structure which differs extensively from the fund structure used in the GAAP basis financial statements. This difference is primarily caused by the elimination of the University of Wisconsin System, and various fiduciary, proprietary and other governmental fund activities from the statutorily General and Transportation funds. In addition, funds such as the Medical Assistance Trust, Hospital Assessment, Budget Stabilization and Permanent Endowment, special revenue funds under statutory reporting, are included as part of the General Fund under GAAP reporting. As a consequence of these differences, a reconciliation between budgetary basis and GAAP basis is provided in Note 1-A of the notes to the required supplementary information. The Budgetary Comparison Schedules for the General and the Transportation Fund present both the original and final appropriated budgets, as well as the actual inflows, outflows, and fund balance on the budgetary basis. The supplementary budget comparison schedule provides this same information (with the exception of the original budget data) for the nonmajor governmental funds with annual budgets. The capital project and debt service funds are excluded from this schedule because no comprehensive budget is approved for these funds. One special revenue fund, the Wisconsin Public Broadcasting Foundation, has been excluded from reporting because it is a blended component unit that is neither budgeted nor included under statutory reporting. Of the permanent funds, only the Historical Society Fund and a portion of the Common School and Normal School funds are budgeted.The State's biennial budget was enacted on July 8, 2021 and published on July 9, 2021. This legislation is recognized by State officials as the original budget and is treated as such on the Budgetary Comparison Schedules. While the legal level of budgetary control for the reported funds is maintained at the appropriation line as specified by the Legislature in Chapter 20 of the Wisconsin Statutes, this level of detail is impractical for inclusion in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. Accordingly, a supplementary report is available upon request which provides budgetary comparisons at the legal level of control. Unexpended appropriation balances lapse at year-end or forward to the subsequent fiscal year depending on the type of appropriation involved: Continuing - unexpended balances automatically forward to ensuing years until fully depleted or repealed by subsequent action of the Legislature. Annual : General Purpose Revenue - unencumbered balances lapse at year end. Program Revenue - unexpended cash balances may be forwarded to the next fiscal year. Biennial - unexpended balances or deficits automatically forward to the second year. At the end of the second year all unencumbered general purpose revenue balances lapse. Sum sufficient - moneys are appropriated and expended in the amounts necessary to accomplish the purpose specified. Encumbrances may be carried over to the next fiscal year as a revision to the budgetary appropriation with Department of Administration approval. Under budgetary reporting, encumbrances are treated like expenditures and are shown as a reduction of fund balance.State of Wisconsin Notes to Required Supplementary Information For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 157 STATE OF WISCONSIN General Purpose External Financial Statements For the fiscal year ended June 30, 20 22 Tony Evers , Governor Department of Administration Kathy Blumenfeld, Secretary -

In our opinion, based on our audit and the reports of the other auditors, th e accompanying financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all ma terial respects, the respec tive financial position of the governmental activities, the business-type activities, the aggregate discretely presented component units, each major fund, and the aggrega te remaining fund information of the State of Wisconsin as of June 30, 2022, the respective chan ges in financial position, and, where applicable, cash flows thereof for the year then ended in ac cordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We did not audit the financial st atements for the Environmental Improvement Fund, which is a major fund and represents 14.2 percent of the assets of the business-type acti vities, and the Deferred Compensation Fund, which represents 3.5 percent of the assets of the aggregate remaining fund information. Those financial statements were audi ted by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinions, insofar as they re late to the amounts included for these funds, are based solely on the reports of the other auditors. In addition, we did not audi t the financial statements of the Wisconsin Housing and Econ omic Development Authority, the University of Wisconsin (UW) Hospitals and Clinics Authority, and the UW Founda tion, which represent 98.9 percent of the total assets and deferred outflows of resources of th e aggregate discretely presented component units. Those financial statements were audited by other au ditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion on the aggregate discretely presen ted component units is based solely upon these audit reports. Basis for Opinions We conducted our audit in accordance with auditi ng standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applic able to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , which is issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Audito r's Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are required to be independent of the State of Wisconsin, and to meet our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the relevant ethical requirements relating to our audit. We believe that the audit evidence we ha ve obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide 4 a basis for our audit opinions. The financial stat ements for the Environmental Improvement Fund, UW Hospitals and Clinics Authority, and the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority were audited by other auditors in ac cordance with these standards. The financial statements of the Deferred Compensation Fund and the UW Foundation were audited by other auditors in accordance with auditing standards gener ally accepted in the United States of America, but not in accordance with Government Auditing Standards . Emphases of Matter As discussed in Note 5B, the fi nancial statements include investments that do not have readily ascertainable market prices and are valued base d on a variety of third-party pricing methods. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may differ from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed. As discussed in Note 5B to the fi nancial statements, as of June 30, 2022, the State Investment Fund held $4.7 billion in a repurchase agreement with the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS). The investments of the State Investment Fund and th e WRS are both administered by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Certain account balances cannot be measured pr ecisely but must be estimated, particularly actuarially accrued liabilit ies and infrastructure assets reported in the financial statements and notes. Notes 14, 17, 18, and 20 include a discussion of esti mates used by funds that accrue liabilities based upon actuarial information, including assumptions used in their calculation, and other sources. Note 1E includes information related to the esti mated historical cost of infrastructure assets constructed prior to July 1, 20 00. Because estimates are based upon information available when the financial statements are prepared, actual valu es may differ from the estimated amounts. These differences cannot be quantified. As discussed in Note 1D to the financial statements, the St ate of Wisconsin implemented Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement Number 87, Leases , which changed accounting and financial reporting for leases. As repo rted in Note 23 to the financial statements, some beginning net position amounts were restated to re flect implementation of this new standard. Our opinions are not modified with respect to these matters. Responsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fa ir presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally acce pted in the United States of America, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free fr om material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, managemen t is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate , that raise substantial doubt about the State of Wisconsin's ability to continue as a going concer n for twelve months beyond the financial statement date, including any currently known information that may raise substantial doubt shortly thereafter. Auditor's Responsibility for the A udit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute 5 assurance. Therefore, reasonable assurance is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and Government Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement wh en it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is high er than one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentio nal omissions, misrepresentations , or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if ther e is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based on the financial statements. In performing an audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and Government Auditing Standards , we exercised professional judgment and maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit. We a lso identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether du e to fraud or error, and designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disc losures in the financial statements. In addition, we obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that were appropriate in the circ umstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the State of Wi sconsin's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed. We also evaluated the appr opriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estima tes made by management, and evaluated the overall presentation of the financial statements. We also concluded, in our judgment, there were no conditions or events, considered in the aggregat e, that raise substantial doubt about the State of Wisconsin's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. We are required to communicate with those ch arged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control-related matters that we identified during the audit. Required Supplementary Information Accounting principles generally accepted in th e United States of America require that the Management's Discussion and Analysis, and the fo llowing items in the required supplementary information section, as listed in the table of contents\u2014Postemployment Benefits-State Health Insurance Program, Postemployment Benefits-Sta te Life Insurance Program, Postemployment Benefits-Supplemental Health Insurance Conversion Credit Program, State's Proportionate Share of Net Pension Liability or Net Pension (Asset), State's Pension Contributions, Infrastructure Assets Reported Using the Modified Approach, Budgetary Comparison Schedule-General Fund, Budgetary Comparison Schedule-Transportation Fund, and Notes to Required Supplementary Information-Budgetary Information\u2014be presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information is the responsibility of managemen t and, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the GASB who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in th e United States of America. These procedures consisted of inquiries of management about the me thods of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency wi th management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any a ssurance on the information because the limited procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to express an opinion or provide any assurance. 6 Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards In accordance with Government Auditing Standards , we have also is sued our report dated December 20, 2022, and published in report 22-26, on our consideration of the State of Wisconsin's internal control over financial repo rting; our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements; and othe r matters. The purpose of that report is solely to describe the scope of our testing of internal contro l over financial reporting and compliance and the result of that testing, and not to provide an opin ion on the effectiveness of the State of Wisconsin's internal control over financial report ing or on compliance. That report is an integral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and should be used when considering the State of Wisconsin's internal control over financial report ing and compliance. LEGISLATIVE AUDIT BUREAU December Management's Discussion and Analysis of the State of Wisconsin's Annual Comprehensive Financial Report (ACFR) presents a discussion and analysis of the State's financial performance during the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2022. It should be read in conjunction with the transmittal letter located at the front of this ACFR, and the State's financial statements, including the note disclosures which are an integral part of the statements, that follow this part of the ACFR. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS -- PRIMARY GOVERNMENT Government-wide (Tables 2 and 3 on Pages 11 and 12) Net Position . The assets plus deferred outflows of resources of the State of Wisconsin exceeded its liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources at the close of Fiscal Year 2022 by $36.9 billion (reported as \"net position\"). Of this amount, $(2.8) billion was reported as \"unrestricted net position\". A positive balance in unrestricted net position would represent the amount available to be used to meet a government's ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors. Changes in Net Position . The State's total net position increased by $5.7 billion in Fiscal Year 2022. Net position of governmental activities increased by $5.2 billion or 26.4 percent, while net position of the business-type activities showed a increase of $558.8 million or 4.8 percent. Excess of Revenues over (under) Expenses -- Governmental Activities . During Fiscal Year 2022, the State's total revenues for governmental activities of $43.7 billion were $6.6 billion more than total expenses (excluding transfers) for governmental activities of $37.1 billion. Of these expenses, $20.1 billion were covered by program revenues. General revenues, generated primarily from various taxes, totaled $23.5 billion. Fund Governmental Funds -- Fund Balances . As of the close of Fiscal Year 2022, the State's governmental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $8.1 billion, an increase of $3.7 billion in comparison with the prior year. Of this total amount, $2.2 billion represents the unassigned fund balances. General Fund -- Fund Balance . At the end of Fiscal Year 2022, total fund balance was $4.6 billion, a change of $3.5 billion from $1.2 billion in the prior year. The unassigned fund balance for the General Fund was $2.2 billion, or 6.7 percent of total General Fund expenditures. Additional information regarding individual funds begins on page 16. Long-term Debt The State's total long-term debt obligations (bonds, notes, and certificates of participation payable) decreased by $365.7 million during the current fiscal year which represents the net difference between new issuances, payments and refundings of outstanding debt. Decreases in debt resulted primarily from repayments in excess of new debt issued. During the year repayments of general obligation debt exceeded new issuances by $102.1 million. Repayments of certificates of participation exceeded new issuances by $1.5 million. Revenue bonds outstanding decreased by $78.8 million. Annual appropriation bonds outstanding decreased by $183.3 million. Additional detail regarding these activities begins on page 21. OVERVIEW OF THE FI NANCIAL STATEMENTS The Financial Section of this A CFR c onsists of four parts: (1) management's discu ssion and analysis (this section) , (2) basic financial statements, (3) additional required sup plementary information, and ( 4) o ptional other supplementary information. Parts (2), (3), and (4) are briefly descr ibed on th e following pa ges:S tate of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 8Basic Financial Statements The basic financial statements include two sets of statements that present different views of the State -- the government-wide financial statements and the fund financial statements . These financial statements also include notes that explain some of the information in the financial statements and provide more detail. The government-wide financial statements provide a broad view of the State's operations. The statements provide both short-term and long-term information about the State's financial status, which assists in assessing the State's financial condition at the end of the fiscal year. The fund financial statements focus on individual parts of the State government, reporting the State's operations in greater detail than the government-wide statements. The basic fund financial statements provide more detailed information on the State's most significant funds. Table 1, below, summarizes the major features of the financial statements. Table 1 Major Features of State of Wisconsin's Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements GOVERNMENT-WIDE STATEMENTS FUND STATEMENTS Governmental Funds Proprietary Funds Fiduciary Funds Scope Entire State government (except fiduciary funds) and the State's component units, reported as follows: Governmental Activities - Most services generally associated with State government fall into this category, including commerce, education, transportation, environmental resources, human relations and resources, general executive, judicial and legislative. Business-Type Activities - Those operations for which a fee is charged to external users for goods and services are reported in this category. Discretely Presented Component Units - These are operations for which the State has financial accountability but that have certain independent qualities. The State's discretely presented component units are discussed in Note 1-B to the financial statements.These funds report activities of the State that are not proprietary or fiduciary in nature. Most of the basic services provided by the State, which are primarily financed through taxes, intergovernmental revenues, and other nonexchange revenues, are reported as governmental funds. Examples of the State's governmental funds (including the State's two major governmental funds), as reported within their respective fund types, follow: General Fund (major fund) Special Revenue: -Transportation (major fund) Debt Service: -Bond Projects: -Capital Improvement Permanent: -Common SchoolThe activities the State operates similar to private business. These funds are used to show activities that operate more like those of commercial enterprises. Fees are charged for services provided, both to outside customers and to other units of the State. Examples of the State's proprietary funds, including the State's three major enterprise funds, follow: Enterprise: -Environmental Improvement (major fund) -University of Wisconsin System (major fund) -Unemployment Reserve (major fund) -Lottery Internal services: -Technology Services -Facilities Operations and MaintenanceThese funds are used to show assets held by the State as trustee or agent for others and cannot be used to support the State's own programs. Examples of the State's fiduciary funds, as reported within their respective fund types, follow: Pension and Other Employee Benefit Trust Funds: -Wisconsin Retirement System Investment Trust: -Local Government Pooled Investment Private Purpose Trust: -Tuition Trust Custodial: -Support Collection Trust Required financial statementsStatement of net position - Presents all of the government's assets and deferred outflows of resources, and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources, with the difference between the two reported as \"net position\". Over time, increases or decreases in the State's net position is an indicator of whether its financial health is improving or weakening, respectively. Statement of activities - Presents a comparison between direct expenses and program revenues for each function of the State's governmental activities and for different identifiable business-type activities of the State.Balance sheet Statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balancesStatement of net position Statement of revenues, expenses and changes in fund net position Statement of cash flowsStatement of fiduciary net position Statement of changes in fiduciary net position Because the State cannot use these assets to finance its operations, fiduciary funds are not included in the government-wide financial statements discussed in the left column.

The required supplementary information includes: Postemployment Benefits - State Health Insurance Program, State Life Insurance Program and Supplemental Health Insurance Conversion Credit Program, State's Proportionate Share of the Net Pension Liability or Net Pension Asset, State's Pension Contributions, Infrastructure Assets Reported Using the Modified Approach, and Budgetary Comparison Schedule of the General and the Transportation funds (includes reconciliations between the statutory and GAAP fund balances at fiscal year-end). Other Supplementary Information The Other Supplementary Information includes combining financial statements for nonmajor governmental funds, nonmajor enterprise funds, internal service funds and fiduciary funds, each of which are added together and presented in single columns in the basic financial statements.State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 10FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE STATE AS A WHOLE Tables 2 and 3 present summary information of the State's net position and changes in net position. Net Position As presented in Table 2, total assets of the State on June 30, 2022 were $65.8 billion and deferred outflows of resources were $5.3 billion , while total liabilities were $28.2 billion and deferred inflows of resources were $6.0 billion , resulting in combined net position (governmental and business-type activities) of $36.9 billion . The largest component of the State's total net position consists of $26.5 billion invested in capital assets (i.e., land, buildings, equipment, infrastructure, and others), less any related debt outstanding that was needed to acquire or construct the assets. Approximately $13.2 billion of net position was restricted by external sources or the State Constitution or Statutes and was not available to finance the day-to-day operations of the State. The unrestricted net position, which, if positive, could be used at the State's discretion, showed a negative balance of $(2.8) billion . Therefore, based on this measurement, no funds were available for discretionary purposes. A contributing factor to the negative balance is that governments recognize a liability on the government-wide statement of net position as soon as an obligation is incurred. While financing focuses on when a liability will be paid, accounting is primarily concerned with when a liability is incurred. Accordingly, the State recognizes long-term liabilities (such as general obligation debt, compensated absences, other postemployment benefits and future benefits and loss liabilities - listed in Note 10 to the financial statements) on the statement of net position. During Fiscal Year 2022 , the State issued $1.0 billion of general obligation bonds, primarily for the acquisition or improvement of land, water, property, highways, buildings, and equipment. At June 30, 2022 general obligation bonds and long-term general obligation notes outstanding totaled $7.5 billion. Certificates of participation, annual appropriation bonds, and revenue bonds are not considered general obligation debt of the State. The outstanding amount of these totaled $67.7 million of certificates of participation, $2.7 billion of annual appropriation bonds, and $2.3 billion of revenue bonds.

The State earned program revenues of $28.7 billion and general revenues of $23.5 billion for total revenues of $52.2 billion during Fiscal Year 2022 . Expenses for the State during Fiscal Year 2022 were $46.5 billion . As a result of the excess of revenues over expenses, the total net position of the State increased $5.7 billion , net of contributions and transfers.

Human relations and resources expenses increased by $ 1.8 billion (10.3 percent) to a total of $ 19.5 billion, due to increases in medical costs. General executive expenses decreased $(375.0) million (17.9 percent) to a total of $ 1.7 billion, due to decreased CARES and ARPA expenditures compared to Fiscal Year 2021. Education expenses increased by $ 726.1 million (8.7 percent) to $9.1 billion, due to increases in general equalization aids, parental choice program for eligible school districts, per pupil aid and aids for special education and school-age parents programs. Commerce, intergovernmental, and legislative expenses increased $ 24.6 million , $10.6 million , and $ 7.1 million , respectively. Conversely, tax relief and other general expenses, environmental resource and judicial expenses decreased $ 48.3 million , $22.2 million , and $ 0.4 million , respectively.

As shown in Table 4, below, approximately 52.0 percent of revenues from all sources earned came from taxes (sales and excise, income, public utility, motor fuel, and other taxes). Operating grants and contributions represent amounts received from other governments/entities - primarily the federal government. Operating grants and contributions for non-capital purposes provided 37.8 percent of total revenues. Capital grants and contributions provided 2.3 percent, charges for services contributed 6.0 percent, while various other revenues provided 1.8 percent of the remaining g overnmental activity revenue sources.

Funds with significant changes in fund balance are discussed below: General Fund The General Fund is the chief operating fund of the State. At June 30, 2022 , the State's General Fund reported a total fund balance of $4.6 billion . The net change in fund balance during Fiscal Year 2022 was $ 3.5 billion , in contrast to $1.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2021 . Major revenue , expenditure and other sources/uses contributing to the change in fund balance are as follows: Revenues Revenues of the General Fund totaled $ 39.3 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 , an increase of $4.8 billion (13.8 percent) from the prior year. Factors contributing to this change included the following: Revenues from taxes increased $2.6 billion . The increase primarily relates to income and sales taxes, which increased $1.9 billion and $ 663.2 million , respectively, from Fiscal Year 2021 . The income tax increase was the result of growth in personal income, while sales tax revenue increases were driven by increased consumer expenditures for taxable goods. Intergovernmental revenues (i.e., federal assistance) increased $ 2.0 billion to $ 16.2 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 . Human relations and resources programs (e.g., Medicaid) reported increased revenues of $ 2.4 billion . Federal reimbursements for grant expenditures increased due to COVID-19 along with a general increase in medical assistance costs. At the end of Fiscal Year 2021, the State recorded unearned revenue of $1.6 billion for unspent American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and Coronavirus Relief Funds. In Fiscal Year 2022, $766.3 million of that amount was spent and subsequently earned and recorded as intergovernmental revenue. During Fiscal Year 2022, the State received an additional $1.3 billion under ARPA. The remaining unspent amount was recorded as unearned revenue by the State and will be recorded as intergovernmental revenue in future years as the funds are spent. Expenditures 2021 Wisconsin Act 58 established spending authority for the State of Wisconsin for Fiscal Year 2022 . Expenditures of the General Fund totaled $ 33.6 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 , an increase of $ 2.2 billion from Fiscal Year 2021 . Factors contributing to the change include the following: Human relations and resources expenditures increased by $ 1.8 billion to $19.4 billion, primarily the result of increased grants and aids to individuals and organizations, in part for coronavirus relief and other medical assistance costs. These costs comprise 57.7 percent of General Fund expenditures. Education expenditures increased $ 718.7 million to 9.0 billion, due in part to increases in parental choice program for eligible school districts, per pupil aid, special needs scholarship program and aids for special education and school- age parents programs in Fiscal Year 2022 . These costs comprise 26.8 percent of General Fund expenditures. Other Financing Sources and Uses Other financing sources/(uses) totaled a net $ (2.3) billion in Fiscal Year 2022 , a $ 262.1 million decrease from Fiscal Year 2021 . The components of this included the following: Transfers out of the General Fund totaled $2.4 billion, an increase of $285.3 million from the prior year. The GPR supplement comprises a large portion of the transfers out and is provided to various enterprise funds. The supplement totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of $37.4 million from the prior year. The University of Wisconsin System, which receives the majority of the GPR supplement, had $998.2 million in GPR expenses in Fiscal Year 2022 , an increase of $36.6 million.State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 16Transfers out for debt service payments to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund totaled $425.0 million in Fiscal Year 2022 compared to $429.2 million in Fiscal Year 2021 . Transfers out to other nonmajor governmental funds were $417.1 million in Fiscal Year 2022 compared to $398.8 million in Fiscal Year 2021 . Transfers out to nonmajor enterprise fund s, Transportation Fund and Unemployment Reserve were $205.8 million, $205.2 million and $60.0 million, respectively. Transfers in to the General Fund increased $2.5 million (from $61.4 million in Fiscal Year 2021 to $63.9 million in Fiscal Year 2022 ). The University of Wisconsin System transferred $ 23.9 million, while nonmajor governmental funds and nonmajor enterprise funds transferred $ 22.1 million and $ 13.9 million, respectively. Note 9D provides additional information on transfers in and out of the General Fund. As of June 30, 2022 , the General Fund reported an unassigned fund balance of $2.2 billion, a change of $ 3.2 billion from the prior year, which had a deficit of $(912.0) million. This is the first year the State's General Fund has ended with a positive unassigned fund balance since the State began issuing an ACFR in Fiscal Year 1990. General Fund Budgetary Highlights Differences between the original budget and the final amended budget were significant and included a $15.0 billion increase in appropriations. Contributing to the variance is the fact that several of the State's programs and various transfers (see the items denoted with *, below) are not included in the original budget. In addition, numerous adjustments to spending estimates were needed as the year progressed because of changing circumstances (spending needs can change dramatically over a one-year period). The largest variances occurred in the following appropriations (in millions): Program Variance Federal Aid CRF and ARPA* $2,939.8 Food Stamps, Electronic Benefit Transfer* 2,529.8 UW System, General Program Operations (part of Statutory General Fund) 1,127.7 Federal Aid Medical Assistance 1,119.2 UW Federal Aid 775.0 DOR Grants 535.4 UW System, Gifts and Nonfederal Grants Contracts 357.3 Inter agency CRF and ARPA Transfer* 345.9 Actual charges to appropriations (expenditures) were $8.7 billion below the final budgeted estimates. Large positive expenditure variances were reported in the the Federal Aid CRF and ARPA ($1.8 billion) appropriations, UW program operations and Federal Aid ($1.7 billion), DCF Medical Assistance Program Benefits ($450.4 million) and DHS Medical Assistance Federal Aid ( $426.8 million). During the past fiscal year, the budgetary-based fund balance increased $2.5 billion for the statutory General Fund, mainly the result of federal funds received under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) which the State has until 2024 to spend and an increase in tax revenues. Net transfers from other funds totaled $(442.3) million in Fiscal Year 2022 compared to $(972.6) million in the prior fiscal year.State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 17Transportation Fund In Fiscal Year 2022 , the Transportation Fund's fund balance increased $ 275.2 million (26.4 percent) from $ 1.0 billion to $1.3 billion . The State constitutionally restricts use of state resources deposited into the Fund for transportation purposes. As such, $ 1.3 billion or 96.7 percent of fund balance is reported as restricted for Fiscal Year 2022 . Remaining fund balance is reported as nonspendable and correlates to prepaid and inventory assets. Primary revenue sources of the fund include motor fuel taxes, intergovernmental, and license and permit revenue sources, as well as interfund transfers in. In Fiscal Year 2022 revenues of the fund increased $103.9 million (3.5 percent) to a total of $3.1 billion . Intergovernmental revenues increased $66.5 million ; use of external sources of funding for projects, rather than state resources regularly contributes to revenue fluctuations in this category between years. License and permit revenues decreased $13.9 million in Fiscal Year 2022 due to decline in vehicle titles registrations, while taxes increased $44.2 million due mainly to an increase in fuel taxes. Transportation expenditures of $ 2.9 billion increased 8.1 percent or $ 215.6 million , including a 16.4 percent or $ 57.8 million increase in capital outlay expenditures . The increase in capital outlay expenditures was the result of increased funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In addition to the expenditures reported in the Transportation Fund, long-term debt- funded transportation expenditures of $72.6 million and $72.6 million were reported in the Capital Improvement Fund and Transportation Revenue Bonds Fund, respectively. In the current year, transportation-related expenditures decreased $35.8 million in the Capital Improvement Fund, and $1.0 million in the Transportation Revenue Bonds Fund. Transfers in increased from $ 62.7 million to $ 228.6 million in Fiscal Year 2022 . This increase is mainly due to a one time transfer from the General Fund of $134.2 million. An on-going transfer equal to 0.25 percent of General Fund taxes as published in the General Fund condition statement is made annually with that amount being $44.7 million in Fiscal Year 2022 . In addition, $23.3 million was transferred from the Petroleum Inspection Special Revenue Fund, compared to $16.2 million transferred in Fiscal Year 2021 . Transfers out decreased $20.4 million to $175.0 million . Transfers out to the Bond Security and Redemption Fund for debt service were $134.5 million, while transfers out to the Conservation Fund were $21.6 million in Fiscal Year 2022 . Proprietary Funds Proprietary funds provide the same type of information found in the government-wide financial statements but in more detail. Significant changes to balances of major proprietary funds from Fiscal Year 2021 to Fiscal Year 2022 include the following: Environmental Improvement Fund net position of the Environmental Improvement Fund increased $34.6 million to $ 2.2 billion . Total assets of the Fund increased by $ 108.9 million , while total liabilities also increased by $ 74.2 million. Assets increased to $2.6 billion as the result of loans to local governments increasing $147.4 million , while cash decreased $37.2 million . Liabilities increased to $402.6 million due to a $ 73.4 million increase in revenue bonds payable. Operating income of the Fund increased by $ 1.8 million to $ 27.4 million in Fiscal Year 2022 . Operating revenue of $ 46.7 million, which consists primarily of investment and interest income, remained steady in Fiscal Year 2022 . Operating expenses increased $0.2 million in Fiscal Year 2022 , the result of a $ 1.3 million increase in interest expense and a $ 0.8 million decrease in salaries and benefits.State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 18Unemployment Reserve Net position of the Unemployment Reserve Fund increased by $ 203.0 million during Fiscal Year 2022 from $ 1.2 billion at June 30, 2021 to $1.4 billion at June 30, 2022 . Benefit expenses decreased from $ 3.5 billion in Fiscal Year 2021 to $683.0 million in Fiscal Year 2022 , a decrease of $2.8 billion (80.4 percent). This decrease is attributed to the average unemployment rate decreasing from 4.9 percent during Fiscal Year 2021 to 3.1 percent during Fiscal Year 2022, along with pandemic-related unemployment programs ending on September 4, 2021. Total operating revenues decreased by $ 2.1 billion from $ 2.9 billion in Fiscal Year 2021 to $ 811.2 million in Fiscal Year 2022 . This decrease is mainly the result of Federal aids revenue for the unemployment program decreasing from $2.5 billion in Fiscal Year 2021 to $334.1 million in Fiscal Year 2022 , a decrease of $2.1 billion (86.1 percent). Employer contributions decreased from $ 463.6 million in Fiscal Year 2021 to $ 451.3 million in Fiscal Year 2022 , a decrease of $ 12.3 million (2.7 percent). The average tax rate on taxable wages decreased from 1.4 percent during Calendar Year 2021 to an estimated 1.1 percent in Calendar Year 2022 . Reimbursements of $20.4 million in Fiscal Year 2022 represented an increase of $14.7 million (259.5 percent) from Fiscal Year 2021 . University of Wisconsin System Fund net position increased $435.7 million to $6.4 billion . Assets, which consist primarily of capital assets and cash, increased $650.6 million to $10.7 billion . The Fund reported a restricted net pension asset of $ 1.1 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 , an increase of $253.4 million from Fiscal Year 2021 , along with a restricted net OPEB asset of $ 148.3 million , which was an increase of $23.8 million from $ 124.5 million in Fiscal Year 2021 . The Fund also reported an increase of $ 418.2 million in investments and a decrease of $ 328.7 million in cash in Fiscal Year 2022 . Total liabilities, which consists primarily of bonds payable and OPEB, increased by $ 220.3 million to $3.8 billion . Deferred outflows of resources increased $784.4 million to $2.3 billion and deferred inflows of resources also increased $778.9 million to $ 2.9 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 . The changes in deferred outflows and inflows were primarily related to changes in pension related amounts. Operating revenues increased $419.6 million or 12.2 percent to $ 3.9 billion . Student tuition, and federal grants and contracts of $1.4 billion and $ 917.9 million , respectively, comprise 60.8 percent of operating revenues. Increases of $141.7 million, $87.4 million and $86.8 million were reported for sales and services of auxiliary enterprises, sales and services of educational activities, federal grants and contracts, respectively. Local and private grants and contracts and sales and services to UW Hospital Authority reported increases of $6.6 million and $3.7 million, respectively. Other income revenues also increased by $73.9 million (19.8 percent). Operating expenses increased $417.1 million or 8.5 percent. Personal services, supplies and services, scholarship and fellowships, depreciation and other expenses increased by $156.9 million, $125.1 million, $83.8 million, $44.6 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Offsetting those changes were decreases in nonoperating investment and interest income, gifts and donations and miscellaneous revenues of $192.7 million, $22.3 million, and $10.1 million, respectively, while operating grants increased $44.8 million. Transfers in to the University of Wisconsin System totaled $ 1.3 billion in Fiscal Year 2022 . The general purpose revenue supplement received from the State's General Fund was $998.2 million an increase of $36.6 million. The Capital Improvement Fund also transferred $191.3 million of bond and note proceeds to the University of Wisconsin System, an increase of $2.7 million from the prior year. Bond proceeds transferred in are a function of on-going capital projects funded with those bonds. Capital contributions decreased $36.5 million from the prior year to $18.7 million in Fiscal Year 2022 .State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 19GOVERNMENT-WIDE CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION Capital Assets At the close of Fiscal Year 2022 , the State reported $33.1 billion invested in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation of $9.6 billion. This represents an increase of $1.0 billion , or 3.2 percent, from Fiscal Year 2021 . Depreciation and amortization charges totaled $202.9 million and $414.3 million for governmental and business-type activities, respectively, in Fiscal Year 2022 . The details of these assets are presented in Table 7, below. Additional information about the State's capital assets is presented in Note 7 to the financial statements.

The total general obligation debt outstanding for the State as of June 30, 2022 was $7.5 billion, as shown in Table 8. During Fiscal Year 2022 , $1.0 billion of general obligation bonds were issued to provide for the acquisition or improvement of land, water, property, highways, buildings, equipment, or facilities for public purposes or to refund outstanding bonds. Of the bonds issued in the current year, $378.2 million were to be used for University of Wisconsin System academic and self-amortizing facilities, $315.1 million for transportation projects, $78.5 million for environmental programs, and $29.6 million for correctional and mental health facilities. The remaining proceeds from new bonds issued were used for various other projects. In 1992 the State established a facility to provide lease purchase financing to state agencies (Master Lease). Lease purchase obligations under the Master Lease are not general obligations of the State but are payable from appropriations of participating state agencies, subject to annual appropriation. The trustee for the facility issues Master Lease certificates of participation that evidence proportionate interest of the owners thereof in lease payments. As of June 30, 2022 , $67.7 million of these certificates were outstanding. In Fiscal Year 2004, the State issued $1.8 billion of annual appropriation bonds to pay the State's unfunded accrued prior service (pension) liability and its unfunded accrued liability for sick leave conversion credits. In Fiscal Year 2009, the State issued $1.5 billion of annual appropriation bonds to purchase the future right, title, and interest in the Tobacco Settlement Revenues (TSRs) from Badger Tobacco Asset Securitization Corporation (BTASC). As of June 30, 2022 , $2.7 billion of these bonds were outstanding. Chapter 18 of the Wisconsin Statutes authorizes the State to issue revenue obligations. These obligations, which are not general obligation debt of the State, are secured by a pledge of revenues or property derived from the operations of a program funded by the issuance of the obligations. Revenue bonds of the primary government totaled $2.3 billion outstanding at June 30, 2022 , as shown in Table 8. These bonds included $1.9 billion of Transportation Revenue Bonds, and $398.6 million of Environmental Improvement Revenue Bonds.

Stat. Sec. 18.05 limit the amount of general obligation bond debt the State can contract in total and in any calendar year. In total, debt cannot exceed five percent of the value of all taxable property in the State. The amount of debt contracted in any calendar year is limited to the lesser of three-quarters of one percent of the aggregate value of taxable property or five percent of the aggregate value of taxable property less net indebtedness at January 1. At June 30, 2022 , State of Wisconsin general obligation fixed rate bonds had a rating of AA+ from Fitch Ratings, AAA from Kroll Bond Rating Agency, Aa1 from Moody's Investors Services, and AA+ from Standard and Poor's Rating Services. General obligation variable rate notes are outstanding in different forms, with ratings from two or more rating agencies. Detailed information about the State's long-term debt activity is presented in Note 11 to the financial statements.State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 21INFRASTRUCTURE - MODIFIED APPROACH The State reports infrastructure (i.e., roads, bridges, and buildings considered an ancillary part of roads) as capital assets. Infrastructure assets exclude right-of-way costs. The State has elected to report its infrastructure assets (11,200 centerline miles of roads and 5,100 bridges with a combined value of $19.4 billion) using the modified approach. Under this method, infrastructure assets are not required to be depreciated if the State manages its eligible infrastructure assets using an asset management system designed to maintain and preserve these assets at a condition level established and disclosed by the State. All infrastructure assets constructed prior to July 1, 2000 have been recorded at estimated historical cost. Historical cost was determined by calculating current costs of a similar asset and deflating that cost, using the Federal Highway Administration's composite index for federal-aid highway construction, to the estimated average construction date. All infrastructure assets constructed on or after July 1, 2000 have been recorded at historical cost. In order to adequately serve the traveling public and support the State economy, it is the State's policy to ensure at least 85 percent of the state-owned roads and bridges are in good or fair condition. As of June 30, 2022 , 92.2 percent of the roads and 97.5 percent of bridges were in good or fair condition, consistent with State policies. This compares to 92.5 percent of the roads and 97.7 percent of bridges as of June 30, 2021 . For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 , actual maintenance and preservation costs for the State's road network were $688.9 million, or $576.3 million less than the estimated amount. On the same date, actual maintenance and preservation costs for the State's bridge network were $58.6 million, or $0.6 million more than the estimated amount. In developing estimated costs at the beginning of the fiscal year, it is difficult to predict the types of projects that will actually incur costs during the year. In addition, the State of Wisconsin, Department of Transportation's multi-year contracting process, allowing encumbrances to carry forward, makes a comparison of actual to estimate amounts difficult since expenditures for the current year may have been budgeted and committed to a project in prior years. ECONOMIC FACTORS During calendar year 2021, the Wisconsin economy recovered strongly from the COVID-19 global pandemic with solid growth throughout the year. Wisconsin employment grew rapidly in 2021 after steep declines in employment in 2020 as a result of the pandemic's economic effects. According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm employment in Wisconsin increased 0.3 percent in 2019, fell 5.5 percent in 2020, and rose 2.1 percent during 2021. Nationally, employment increased 1.3 percent in 2019, fell 5.8 percent in 2020, and rose 2.8 percent during 2021. Wisconsin employment growth had been constrained before the shocks of the COVID-19 pandemic due to slower population growth and already high labor force participation, limiting room for growth. More recently, employment has recovered substantially with the overall national economic recovery. Since the trough in employment in April 2020, national employment is up 15.7 percent and Wisconsin employment is up 13.9 percent through September 2022. Relative to prepandemic February 2020 levels, Wisconsin employment is down 1.5 percent while employment nationally is up 0.3 percent. Wisconsin's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in September 2022 was 3.2 percent, below the 3.5 percent national unemployment rate for the same month. Wisconsin gross state product bounced back along with the overall national recovery in 2021, posting growth of 8.2 percent compared to 10.7 percent growth nationally. In 2020, Wisconsin gross state product declined by 1.3 percent compared to 1.5 percent nationally. Prior to the pandemic, Wisconsin grew 3.8 percent in 2019 compared to 4.1 percent nationally. Personal income growth followed the trajectory of overall economic growth, with a recovery in wages supplanting large transfer payments as the driver of growth. Wisconsin personal income grew by 6.7 percent in 2021 compared to 7.5 percent nationally. In 2019 and 2020, Wisconsin personal income grew 4.3 percent and 6.0 percent, similar to the national growth rates of 5.1 percent and 6.7 percent. On a per capita basis, Wisconsin's income performance is similar to the nation's. Per capita income in Wisconsin increased by 3.9 percent, 5.8 percent and 6.6 percent in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. This compares to growth of 4.6 percent, 6.2 percent and 7.3 percent in the same years nationally. Relative to the national average, Wisconsin per capita income has remained in approximately the same range for the past three years at 94.0 percent, 93.6 percent and 93.0 percent of the national average in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Wisconsin's statewide total property value increased again in 2022 for the ninth straight year following five years of declines from 2009 through 2013. The increase in values has been broad-based, reflecting improvements in all major sectors. In 2022, State of Wisconsin Management's Discussion and Analysis For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 22total property values increased 13.8 percent, with residential property value growing at 14.9 percent. In addition, commercial real estate values grew 13.2 percent and manufacturing values grew 4.8 percent.

Notes To The Financial Statements 47NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES A.Basis of Presentation The accompanying basic financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for governments as prescribed by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). B.Financial Reporting Entity For GAAP purposes, the State of Wisconsin includes all funds, elected offices, departments and agencies of the State, as well as boards, commissions, authorities and universities. The State has also considered all potential \"component units\" for which it is financially accountable, and other affiliated organizations for which the nature and significance of their relationship, including their ongoing financial support, with the State are such that exclusion would cause the State's financial statements to be misleading or incomplete. The decision to include a potential component unit in the State's reporting entity is based on the criteria set forth in GASB Statement No. 14, The Financial Reporting Entity, GASB Statement No. 39, Determining Whether Certain Organizations Are Component Units, an amendment of GASB Statement No. 14, and GASB Statement No. 61, The Financial Reporting Entity: Omnibus, an amendment of GASB Statements No. 14 and No. 34. GASB Statement No. 14 criteria include the ability to appoint a voting majority of an organization's governing body and (1) the ability of the State to impose its will on that organization or (2) the potential for the organization to provide specific financial benefits to, or impose specific financial burdens on, the State. GASB Statement No. 39 provisions relate to separately legal, tax-exempt organizations and include: (1) the economic resources received or held are entirely or almost entirely for the direct benefit of the State, (2) the State is entitled to, or has the ability to otherwise access, a majority of the economic resources received or held by the separate organization, and (3) the economic resources received or held by an individual organization that the State is entitled to, or has the ability to otherwise access, are significant to the State. GASB Statement No. 61 modifies certain requirements for inclusion in the financial reporting entity, especially in regard to the fiscal dependency criterion where a financial benefit or burden relationship is now required. It also amends the \"blending\" criteria for component units and clarifies the reporting of equity interests in legally separate organizations.Based upon the application of the criteria contained in GASB Statement No. 14, as amended by GASB Statement No. 39, the Wisconsin Public Broadcasting Foundation, Inc. is reported as a blended component unit; and the Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority, the Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan, the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation and the University of Wisconsin Foundation, are presented as discrete component units, as discussed below. Complete financial statements of the individual component units that issue separate statements can be obtained from their respective administrative offices: Wisconsin Public Broadcasting Foundation Inc. Wisconsin Educational Communications Board 3319 West Beltline Highway Madison, WI 53713 http://www.ecb.org Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority 908 East Main Street, Suite 501 Madison, WI 53703 http://www.wheda.com Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan Office of the Commissioner of Insurance 125 South Webster Street Madison, WI 53703 http://oci.wi.gov University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority 301 South Westfield Road Madison, WI 53717 http://www.uwhealth.org Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation 201 West Washington Avenue Madison, Wisconsin 53703 http://www.wedc.org University of Wisconsin Foundation 1848 University Avenue Madison, WI 53726-4090 https:// www.supportuw.orgState of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 48Blended Component Unit Blended component units are entities that are legally separate from the State but are so intertwined with the State that they are, in substance, the same as the State. The blended component unit serves or benefits the primary government. They are reported as part of the State and blended into the appropriate funds. Wisconsin Public Broadcasting Foundation, Inc. - The Wisconsin Public Broadcasting Foundation, Inc. (Foundation), created in 1983 by the Wisconsin Legislature, is a private, non-stock, nonprofit Wisconsin Corporation, wholly owned by the Wisconsin Educational Communications Board (ECB), a unit of the State. The Foundation solicits funds in the name of, and with the approval of, the ECB. The Foundation's funds are managed by a five-member board of trustees consisting of the executive director of the ECB and four members of the ECB board. The Foundation is reported as a special revenue fund. Discretely Presented Component Units Discretely presented component units are entities which are legally separate from the State, but are financially accountable to the State, whose relationship with the State is such that exclusion would cause the State's financial statements to be misleading or incomplete. The Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority, the Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan, the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority, the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation and the University of Wisconsin Foundation are reported in a separate column and in separate rows in the government-wide statements to emphasize that they are legally separate. Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority - The Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority (Authority) was established by the Wisconsin Legislature in 1972 to help meet the housing needs of Wisconsin's low and moderate income citizens. The State has significantly expanded the scope of services of the Authority by adding programs that include financing for farmers and for economic development projects. While the Authority receives no State tax dollars for its bond- supported programs and the State is not liable on bonds the Authority issues, the State has the ability to impose its will on the Authority through legislation. The State appoints the Authority's Board. The Authority reports on a June 30 fiscal year-end. Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan - The Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan (Plan) was established by rule of the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to provide health care liability insurance and liability coverage normally incidental to health care liability insurance to eligible health care providers in the State. Eight out of 13 members of the Board of Directors are appointed by the Governor, and the State has the ability to impose its will upon the Plan. The Plan reports on a fiscal year ended December 31.University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority - The University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority (Hospital) is a not-for-profit academic medical center. The Hospital provides comprehensive health care to patients, education programs, research and community service. Prior to June 1996, the Hospital was a unit of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In June 1996, in accordance with legislation enacted by the State Legislature, the Hospital was restructured as a Public Authority, a public body corporate and politic created by State statutes. The State appoints a majority of the Hospital's Board of Directors and a financial benefit/burden relationship exists between the Hospital and the State. The Hospital reports on a June 30 fiscal year-end. The legislation that created the Hospital Authority also provided, among other things, for the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System to execute various agreements with the Hospital. These agreements include an Affiliation Agreement, a Lease Agreement, a Conveyance Agreement and a Contractual Services Agreement and Operating and Service Agreement. The Affiliation Agreement requires the Hospital to continue to support the educational, research and clinical activities of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which are administered by the Hospital. Under the terms of a Lease Agreement, the Hospital leases facilities which were occupied by the Hospital as of June 29, 1996. Under a Conveyance Agreement, certain assets and liabilities related to the Hospital were identified and transferred to the Hospital effective July 1, 1996. Subject to the Contractual Services Agreement and Operating and Service Agreement between the Board of Regents and the Hospital, the two parties have entered into contracts for the continuation of services in support of programs and operations. Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation - The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) is a legally separate body corporate and politic. The WEDC's primary purpose is economic development activities in the State. The State appoints a majority of the WEDC's Board, has the ability to impose its will on the WEDC, and a financial benefit/burden relationship exists. The WEDC reports on a fiscal year ended June 30. University of Wisconsin Foundation - The University of Wisconsin Foundation (the Foundation) is a legally separate, tax-exempt component unit of the State. The Foundation acts primarily as a fund-raising organization to supplement the resources that are available mostly to the University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW- Madison) as well as several other units of the University of Wisconsin System in support of its programs. These include scientific, literary, athletic and educational program purposes. The University of Wisconsin System is reported as an enterprise fund of the State. Although the State does not control the timing or amount of receipts from the Foundation, the majority of resources, or income thereon, that the Foundation holds and invests, are restricted to the activities of the UW-Madison by the donors. Because these restricted resources held by the Foundation can only be used by, or for the benefit of, the UW-Madison and several State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 49other units of the University of Wisconsin System, the Foundation is considered a component unit of the State. The Foundation reports on a fiscal year ended June 30. Related Organizations These related organizations are excluded from the reporting entity because the State's accountability does not extend beyond appointing a voting majority of the organization's board members. Financial statements are available from the respective organizations. Wisconsin Health and Educational Facilities Authority - a public body politic and corporate that provides financing for capital expenditures and refinancing of indebtedness for Wisconsin health care and educational institutions. Fox River Navigational System Authority - created under Chapter 237 as a public body corporate and politic to oversee the Fox River navigational system after the federal government (the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) transferred the system to the State. C.Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements The government-wide financial statements consist of the statement of net position and the statement of activities. These statements report information on all activities, except for fiduciary activities, of the primary government and its component units. The statement of net position and the statement of activities distinguish between the governmental and business-type activities of the State. Governmental activities are generally financed through taxes, intergovernmental revenues and other nonexchange revenues. Business-type activities are generally financed in whole or in part by fees charged to external parties for goods and services. The focus of the government-wide statements is the primary government. A separate column on the statement of net position and the statement of activities reports activities for all discretely presented component units. The fund financial statements provide detailed information on all governmental, proprietary and fiduciary funds. Separate columns are presented for all major governmental and enterprise funds. Nonmajor governmental and enterprise funds are aggregated and presented as a single column on the respective governmental or proprietary statements. Internal service funds are exempt from the major fund reporting requirements and are aggregated and ultimately reported as a single column on the proprietary statements. Fiduciary funds are also exempt from major fund reporting and are aggregated by fund type and ultimately reported as single columns on the fiduciary statements.D.Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement Presentation The government-wide statement of net position and statement of activities, as well as the proprietary and fiduciary fund statements, are reported using the economic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting. With this measurement focus, all assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources associated with the operation of these funds are included on the statement of net position. Under the accrual basis, revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when the related liability is incurred. In the University of Wisconsin System's enterprise fund, revenues and expenses of an academic term that spans two fiscal years are recognized in two years based on a proration of summer session days. In reporting the financial activity of its enterprise funds and business-type activities, the State applies all applicable GASB pronouncements. Most of the funds included in the State's Annual Comprehensive Financial Report are presented on a fiscal year ended June 30. However, because funds of the Department of Employee Trust Funds (DETF) are administered on a calendar year basis, they are presented on a fiscal year ended December 31. This may result in GASB standards being implemented in different fiscal years for the DETF GAAP funds. Funds reported as of December 31 include: Wisconsin Retirement System, Accumulated Sick Leave Conversion Credit, Supplemental Health Insurance Conversion Credit, Wisconsin Deferred Compensation, Duty Disability, Reimbursed Employee Expense, Local Retiree Life Insurance, Retiree Life Insurance, Milwaukee Retirement System, Retiree Health Insurance, Local Retiree Health Insurance, Income Continuation Insurance, and Health Insurance. As a result of the differences in timing, transactions between funds with different fiscal year ends may result in inconsistencies in amounts reported as due to/due from other funds or as interfund transfers. Similar differences may occur in amounts reported as due to/from component units. The University of Wisconsin Foundation and Wisconsin Health Care Liability Insurance Plan are reported as component units. The Foundation financial statements are prepared using accounting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board as they apply to not-for-profit corporations. The Plan financial statements are prepared using prescribed statutory accounting practices included in the National Association of Insurance Commissioner's Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual. Statutory accounting practices vary somewhat from United States GAAP, but differences are expected to be immaterial.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 50Governmental fund financial statements are accounted for using the current financial resources measurement focus. With this measurement focus, only current assets and current liabilities generally are included on the balance sheet. Operating statements of these funds present increases (i.e., revenues and other financing sources) and decreases (i.e., expenditures and other financing uses) in net available financial resources. Governmental funds are reported on the modified accrual basis of accounting. This basis of accounting recognizes revenues generally when they become measurable and available to pay current reporting period liabilities. For this purpose, the State considers tax revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days of the end of the current fiscal year end. Other revenues are considered to be available if received within one year after the fiscal year end except for tobacco settlement revenues for which just one-half of revenues expected to be received within one year are recognized. Material revenue sources susceptible to accrual include individual and corporate income taxes, sales taxes, public utility taxes, motor fuel taxes and federal revenues. Expenditures and related liabilities are recognized when obligations are incurred as a result of the receipt of goods and services. However, expenditures related to debt service, compensated absences, and claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due. The State reports the following major funds: Major Governmental Funds General Fund - the primary operating fund of the State, accounts for all financial transactions except those required to be accounted for in another fund. Transportation Fund - a special revenue fund, accounts for the proceeds from motor fuel taxes, vehicle registrations, licensing fees, and federal and local governments which are used to supply and support safe, efficient and effective transportation in Wisconsin.Major Enterprise Funds Environmental Improvement Fund - accounts for financial resources generated and used for clean water projects. Federal capitalization grants, interest earnings, revenue bond proceeds, and general obligation bond proceeds are its primary funding sources. University of Wisconsin System Fund - accounts for the 13 four-year universities, 13 additional campuses affiliated with seven of the four-year institutions, and System Administration. Unemployment Reserve Fund - accounts for unemployment contributions made by employers, federal program receipts, benefit payment recoveries and unemployment benefits paid to laid off workers in the State. In addition, the State reports the following fund types: Governmental Funds Special Revenue Funds - account for and report the proceeds of specific revenue sources that are restricted or committed to expenditure for specified purposes other than debt service or capital projects. Examples include the Conservation Fund and the Petroleum Inspection Fund. Debt Service Funds - account for and report financial resources that are restricted, committed, or assigned to expenditure for principal and interest. Financial resources that are being accumulated for future principal and interest are also reported in debt service funds. Capital Projects Funds - account for and report financial resources that are restricted, committed or assigned to expenditure for capital outlays, including the acquisition or construction of capital facilities and other capital assets (other than those financed by proprietary funds or that will be held in trust for individuals, private organizations, or other governments). Permanent Funds - account for and report resources that are restricted to the extent that only earnings, and not principal, may be used for purposes that support the State's programs - that is, for the benefit of the State or its citizenry.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 51Proprietary Funds Enterprise Funds - account for the activities for which fees are charged to external users for goods or services. Examples include the Lottery Fund and the Veterans Trust Fund. Internal Service Funds - account for the operations of State agencies which provide goods or services to other State units or other governments on a cost-reimbursement basis. These services include technology, fleet management, financial, facilities management, risk management, human resource services and accumulated sick leave. Additional goods and services are provided by the inmate work experience program, Badger State Industries. Fiduciary Funds Pension and Other Employee Benefit Trust Fund s - used to account for resources that are required to be held in trust for members and beneficiaries for public employee retirement or other benefit plans e.g. Wisconsin Retirement System. Investment Trust Funds - account for assets invested on a commingled basis by the State on behalf of other governmental entities e.g. local government pooled investments. Private-purpose Trust Funds - account for all other trust arrangements which benefit individuals, private organizations, or other governments e.g. the state-sponsored college savings program. Custodial Funds - account for those assets for which the State acts solely in a custodial capacity e.g. the collection and disbursement of court-ordered child support payments. Amounts reported as program revenues on the government-wide statement of activities include (a) charges for services - amounts received from customers or applicants who purchase, use or directly benefit from the goods, services or privileges provided by the State; including interest earnings from various loan funds/ component units, (b) program-specific operating grants, contributions, and restricted interest, and (c) program-specific capital grants, contributions, and restricted interest. General revenues consist of taxes and all other revenues that do not meet the definition of program revenues. Special items, if any, are significant transactions or events within the control of management that are either unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence. As a general rule, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the government-wide financial statements. This includes all internal service fund activity, as well as other internal allocations. Exceptions to this general rule are certain charges between various functions of the government, whose elimination would distort the direct costs and program revenues reported for the various functions concerned.The revenues and expenses shown on the proprietary fund statements are identified as either operating or nonoperating. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from providing goods and services in connection with a proprietary fund's primary mission. The State's enterprise funds are involved in many diverse fields including patient care, insurance programs, loan programs, the University of Wisconsin System, employee benefit plans, and the lottery. The internal service funds provide services and goods to other State agencies and departments. A significant portion of operating revenues for the proprietary funds is recorded under charges for goods and services. In the case of the State's loan program enterprise funds, investment and interest income is an important component of operating revenue. Operating revenues of the University of Wisconsin include tuition and fees, certain grants and contracts resulting from exchange transactions, and sales and services of educational activities and auxiliary enterprises. In regards to the employee benefit plans, the primary operating revenue source is participant and employer contributions. Operating expenses for the proprietary funds include the costs of sales and services, benefit expenses, administration expenses and depreciation on capital assets. All revenues and expenses not related to a fund's primary purpose are reported as nonoperating. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use, it is the State's policy to use restricted resources first, then unrestricted resources as they are needed. GASB Standards Implemented During the Fiscal Year Effective for Fiscal Year 2022 , the State implemented the following new standards issued by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB). GASB Statement No. 87, Leases, establishes a single model for lease accounting based on the principle that leases are financings of the right to use an underlying asset. GASB Statement No. 92, Omnibus 2020 , addresses practice issues that were identified during the implementation of certain GASB standards. The standard addresses a variety of topics including leases, intra-entity transfers, pensions, fiduciary activities, asset retirement obligations, public entity risk pools, fair value measurements and derivative instruments. GASB Statement No. 93, Replacement of Interbank Offered Rates, addresses the accounting and financial reporting implications that result from the replacement of an interbank offered rate. GASB Statement No. 98, The Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, established the term annual comprehensive financial report and the acronym ACFR. GASB Statement No. 99, Omnibus 2022, paragraphs 26-32 relating to the replacement of LIBOR, SNAP benefits, disclosure of nonmonetary transactions, pledges of future revenues when State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 52resources are not received by the pledging government and terminology updates. E.Assets, Deferred Outflows of Resources, Liabilities, Deferred Inflows of Resources, and Net Position/Fund Balances 1. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash balances of most funds are deposited with the Department of Administration (DOA) where the available balances beyond immediate needs are pooled in the State Investment Fund for short-term investment purposes. Balances pooled are restricted to legally stipulated investments valued consistent with GASB Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement and Application . Cash balances not controlled by DOA may be invested where permitted by statute. Cash and cash equivalents, reported on the balance sheet and statement of cash flows, include bank accounts, petty cash, cash in transit, short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less such as certificates of deposit, money market certificates, repurchase agreements and individual funds' shares in the State Investment Fund. GASB Statement No. 40, Deposit and Investment Risk Disclosures , requires disclosure of risks associated with deposit and investment balances and the policies applied to mitigate such risks. Specific disclosures are included in Note 5, Deposits and Investments. 2. Investments The State may invest in direct obligations of the United States and Canada, securities guaranteed by the United States, certificates of deposit issued by banks in the United States and solvent financial institutions in the State, commercial paper and nonsecured corporate notes and bonds, banker's acceptances, participation agreements, privately placed bonds and mortgages, common and preferred stock and other securities approved by applicable sections of the Wisconsin Statutes, bond resolutions, and various trust indentures (see Note 5 to the financial statements). Investments of the primary government are reported at fair value consistent with the provisions of GASB Statement No. 72, Fair Value Measurement and Application . Typically, fair value information is determined using quoted market prices. However, when quoted market prices are not available for certain securities, fair values are estimated through techniques such as discounted future cash flows, matrix pricing and multi-tiers. In some instances, securities are reported at cost. Certain non- public or closely held stocks are carried at cost since no independent quotation is available to price these securities. Further, certain investment agreements are reported on a cost basis because the State cannot readily determine whether these agreements meet the definition of interest-earning investment contracts as defined by GASB Statement No. 31. However, the impact on the financial statements is immaterial.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 53Under Wisconsin Statutes, the investment earnings of certain Permanent Funds are assigned to other funds. The following table shows the funds earning the investment income and the ultimate recipients of that income: Fund Generating Investment IncomeFund Receiving Investment Income Agricultural College University of Wisconsin System Normal School General Fund and University of Wisconsin System University University of Wisconsin System 3. Mortgage and Other Loans Mortgage loans of the Veterans Trust Fund program, a business- type activity, are stated at the outstanding loan balance less an allowance for doubtful accounts. 4. Forestation State Tax 2017 Wis. Act 59 (the Budget Act) ended the forestry mill tax, the only property tax that had been levied by the State. The proceeds of the tax had been paid to the Conservation Fund. The tax ended effective with the January 1, 2017 property tax assessments (property taxes levied in 2017 for payment in 2018). 5. Interfund Assets/Liabilities During the course of operations, numerous transactions occur between individual funds for goods provided or services rendered. The balance sheet or statement of net position for proprietary and fiduciary funds classifies these receivables and payables as \"Due from Other Funds\" or \"Due to Receivables\" Payables.\" Long-term interfund loans are classified \"Advances to Other Funds\" and \"Advances from Other Funds\". Balances that exist between the primary government and component units are classified as \"Due to/from Primary Government\" and, correspondingly, \"Due to/from Component Units\". Amounts reported in the funds as interfund assets/liabilities are eliminated in the governmental and business-type columns of the Statement of Net Position, except for the net residual amount due between governmental and business-type activities which is shown as internal balances.6. Inventories and Prepaid Items Inventories of governmental and proprietary funds are valued at cost, which approximates market, using the first-in/first-out, last in/ first out, or weighted-average method. The costs of governmental fund-type inventories are recorded as expenditures when purchased rather than when consumed. Inventories of the University of Wisconsin System held by central stores are valued at average cost, fuels are valued at market, and other inventories held by individual institutional cost centers are valued using a variety of cost flow assumptions that, for each type of inventory, are consistently applied from year to year. Prepaid items reflect payments for costs applicable to future accounting periods. The fund balances of governmental funds are reported as nonspendable for inventories and prepaid items, except in cases where prepaid items are offset by unearned revenues, to indicate that these accounts do not represent expendable available financial resources. 7. Capital Assets Capital assets, which include property, plant, equipment, intangibles, land, library holdings, and infrastructure assets (roads, bridges, and buildings considered an ancillary part of roads), are reported in the applicable governmental or business-type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. Assets of the primary government, other than infrastructure and land purchased for the construction of infrastructure assets, are capitalized when they have a unit cost of $5,000 or more (except for a collection of library resources that must have a cumulative value equal to or greater than $5.0 million and software purchased by the University of Wisconsin System) and a useful life of more than one year. In addition, internally generated intangible assets are capitalized only if costs are equal to or are greater than $1.0 million. Purchased or constructed capital assets are valued at cost or estimated historical cost if actual historical cost is not practicably determinable. Donated capital assets are recorded at their acquisition value at the time received. The State has elected to report infrastructure assets (roads, bridges and buildings considered an ancillary part of roads) using the modified approach. Under this method infrastructure assets are not required to be depreciated if the State manages its eligible infrastructure assets using an asset management system designed to maintain and preserve its infrastructure assets at a condition level established and disclosed by the State. All infrastructure assets constructed prior to July 1, 2000 have been recorded at estimated historical cost which was determined by calculating the current cost of a similar asset and deflating that cost using Federal Highway Administration's composite index for State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 54federal aid highway construction to the estimated average construction date. All infrastructure assets constructed after July 1, 2000 have been recorded at historical cost. The costs of maintenance and preservation that do not add to the asset's capacity or efficiency are not capitalized. Interest incurred during construction is not capitalized. Exhaustible capital assets of the primary government generally are depreciated on the straight-line method over the asset's useful life. Select buildings of the University of Wisconsin System are depreciated using the componentized method over the estimated useful life of the related assets. Depreciation expense is recorded in the government-wide financial statements, as well as in the proprietary fund statements. There is no depreciation recorded for land, construction in process, and infrastructure. In addition, depreciation is not recorded for certain other capital assets including the State Capitol, Executive Residence and associated furnishings, and the Historical Society library collection. Generally, estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings and improvements 6 - 40 years Equipment, machinery and furnishings 3 - 15 years Library Holdings 15 years Collections of works of art, historical treasures, and similar assets, which are on public display, used in furtherance of historical education, or involved in advancement of artistic or historical research, are not capitalized unless these collections were already capitalized at June 30, 1999. Collections range from memorabilia on display in the Wisconsin Veterans Museum, the Wisconsin Historical Society Museum and other museums to buildings such as the Villa Louis Mansion and the Fur Trade Museum located at the Villa Louis historical site. In addition, works of art or historical treasures on display in the various State office buildings, as well as statues on display outside the State Capitol, also are not capitalized. 8. Restricted and Limited Use Assets Assets that are required to be held and/or used as specified in Wisconsin statutes, bond indentures, bond resolutions, trustee agreements, board resolutions, and donor specifications have been reported as Restricted and Limited Use Assets. 9. Local Assistance Aids Municipal and County Shared Revenue Program Through the Municipal and County Shared Revenue Program, the State distributes general revenues collected from general State tax sources to municipal and county governments to be used for providing local government services. State statutes require that payment to local governments be made during July and November.The State was liable to various local governments for unpaid shared revenue aid. To measure the amount of the program allocable to the State's fiscal year, the amount is prorated over portions of recipient local governments' calendar fiscal years that are within the State's fiscal year. The result is that a liability of $448.9 million representing one-half of the total appropriated amount is reported at June 30, 2022 as Due to Other Governments. State Property Tax Credit Program The State was liable to various taxing jurisdictions for the school levy, the first dollar, and the lottery property tax credits paid through the State Property Tax Credit Program. The school levy tax credit provides property tax relief in the form of State credits on individual property tax bills. The first dollar tax credit was first established for property taxes levied in 2008, and payable in 2009. This credit is allowed on every taxable real estate parcel containing an improvement in the state. Under the lottery property tax credit, owners of property used as a primary residence receive a tax credit equal to the school property tax on a portion of the dwelling's value. State statutes require that payment to local taxing jurisdictions for the school levy and first dollar tax credits be made during July. Although the state property tax credit is calculated on the property tax levy for school purposes, the State's July payment is paid to an administering municipality who treats the payment the same as other tax collections and distributes the collections to the various tax levying jurisdictions (e.g., cities, towns, and school districts). The portion of the liability payable to school districts for the school levy and first dollar tax credits represents the amount of the July payment earned over the school districts' previous fiscal year ended June 30. Since the entire school districts' portion of the July payment occurs within the State's fiscal year, 100 percent of the July payment relating to the school taxing jurisdictions' levy is reported as a liability at June 30, 2022. The portion of the liability payable to general government for the school levy and first dollar tax credits represents the amount of the July payment prorated over the portion of the local governments' calendar year which is within the State's fiscal year. The result is that 50 percent of the July payment based on the general government taxing jurisdictions' levy is reported as a liability at June 30, 2022. The aggregated State Property Tax Credit Program liability of $804.9 million is reported in the General Fund as Due to Other Governments. Of that amount, $695.9 million relates to the school levy tax credit and $109.0 million relates to the first dollar tax credit.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 55The lottery property tax credit is accounted for in the Lottery Fund, an enterprise fund that records revenues and expenses on the accrual basis. The State pays municipal treasurers for lottery credits who distribute the moneys to the various taxing jurisdictions. For credits reducing the calendar year 2022 property tax bills, the State made this payment in March 2022 . A portion of the State's March payment distributed to the general government taxing jurisdictions applies to their fiscal year that ends on December 31. Therefore, part of the March distribution represents an expense of the State in Fiscal Year 2022 , while the remaining portion represents advanced payments. The resulting deferred outflow of resources reported within the Lottery Fund totals $88.3 million at June 30, 2022 . State Aid for Exempt Computers The Aid for Exempt Computers compensates local governments for tax base lost due to the property tax exemption for computers, software and related equipment. Aid payments are calculated using a procedure that results in an aid amount equal to the amount of taxes that would be paid if the property were taxable. Payments to local governments are made on the fourth Monday in July. At June 30, 2022, the State was liable to various local governments and other taxing jurisdictions for unpaid exempt computer aid payments of $67.4 million. State Aid for Exempt Personal Property 2017 Wis. Act 59 (the Budget Act) exempted machinery, tools, and patterns, not including such items considered manufacturing property under current law, from the property tax effective with property assessed as of January 1, 2018 (the 2018(19) property tax levy). The Act also created a state aid program administered by DOR to make payments to each local taxing jurisdiction, including tax increment districts, that imposed property taxes on those items that were not manufacturing property in 2017(18). Upon certification by DOR, payments will be made to local taxing jurisdictions on or before the first Monday in May. Under the Act, aid payments totaling $78.2 million were made in May 2022. State Aid for Video Service Provider Fee 2019 Wis. Act 9 (the Budget Act) reduced the fee rate municipalities can charge cable and phone companies. This state aid to municipalities replaces the lost revenue related to the fee reduction. Payments to local governments are made on the fourth Monday in July. At June 30, 2022, the State was liable to various local governments and other taxing jurisdictions for unpaid aid for video service fees of $5.0 million.10. Long-term Debt Obligations In the government-wide financial statements, and proprietary fund types in the fund financial statements, long-term debt is reported as a liability net of the applicable bond premium or discount. Bond premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method on a prospective basis beginning in Fiscal Year 2004, except for the annual appropriation bonds that are amortized ratably over the life of the obligations to which they relate. In the fund financial statements, governmental fund types recognize flows for bond premiums and discounts, as well as issuance costs, during the current period. The face amount of the debt issued is reported as other financing sources. Premiums and discounts are reported as other financing sources and other financing uses, respectively. Issuance costs are reported as other debt service expenditures for governmental fund types, and non- operating expenses for proprietary fund types. On the government-wide financial statements, bond premiums and discounts related to the Transportation Revenue Bonds, which finance programs in a capital projects fund, are amortized ratably over the life of the obligations to which they relate. Results from the use of this method do not vary materially from those that would be obtained by use of the effective interest rate method. 11. Compensated Absences Consistent with the compensated absences reporting standards of GASB Statement No. 16, Accounting for Compensated Absences , an accrual for certain salary-related payments associated with annual leave and an accrual for a certain portion of sick leave is included in the compensated absences liability at year end. Annual Leave Full-time employees' annual leave days are credited on January 1 of each calendar year in general at a minimum of 15 or 13 days per year, depending on Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) status. There is no requirement to use annual leave. However, unused leave is lost unless approval to carry over the unused portion is obtained from the employing agency. In general, each full-time employee is eligible for four and one-half personal holidays each calendar year, provided the employee is in pay status for at least one day in the year. If a holiday occurs on a Saturday, employees receive leave time proportional to their working status to use at their discretion. The State's compensated absence liability at June 30 consists of accumulated unpaid annual leave, personal holiday hours, and Saturday/legal holiday hours earned and vested during January through June. The liability is reported in the government-wide, proprietary fund types and fiduciary funds.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 56Sick Leave Full-time employees earn sick leave at a rate of five hours per pay period. Unused sick leave is accumulated from year to year without limit until termination or retirement. Accumulated sick leave is not paid. However, at employee retirement the accumulated sick leave may be converted to pay for the retiree's health insurance premiums. The State accumulates resources to pay for the expected health insurance premiums of retired employees. The portion of the health insurance obligation funded through the sick leave conversion and accumulated resources are presented as two funds. The basic component of sick leave is presented as an internal service fund and the supplementary component of sick leave is presented as a pension and other employee benefit trust fund. 12. Unearned Revenue In both the government-wide and fund financial statements unearned revenue represents amounts for which asset recognition criteria have been met, but not revenue recognition criteria. Unearned revenue arises when resources are received by the State before it has a legal claim to them, such as when grant moneys are received prior to the incurrence of qualifying expenditures. In subsequent periods, when revenue recognition criteria are met, or when the State has a legal claim to the resources, the liability for unearned revenue is removed and revenue is recognized. Unearned revenue of the University of Wisconsin System consists of payments received but not earned at June 30, 2022 , primarily for summer session tuition, tuition and room deposits for the next fall term, advance ticket sales for upcoming intercollegiate athletic events, and amounts received from grant and contract sponsors that have not yet been earned under the terms of the agreement. 13. Self-Insurance Consistent with the requirements of GASB Statement No. 10, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Risk Financing and Related Insurance Issues , the State's risk management activities are reported in an internal service fund, and the claims liabilities associated with that fund are reported therein. The State's policy is generally not to purchase commercial insurance for the risk of losses to which it is exposed. Instead, State management believes it is more economical to manage its own risks internally. The Risk Management Fund, an internal service fund, is used to pay for losses incurred by any State agency and for administrative costs incurred to manage a state- wide risk management program. These losses include damage to property owned by the agencies, personal injury or property damage liabilities incurred by a State officer, agent or employee, and worker's compensation costs for State employees. A limited amount of insurance is purchased to limit the exposure to catastrophic losses. Annually, a charge is allocated to each agency for its proportionate share of the estimated cost attributable to the program per Wis. Stat. Sec. 16.865(8). 14. Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Deferred outflows of resources represent a consumption of net assets by the government that is applicable to a future reporting period. Deferred inflows of resources represent an acquisition of net assets by the government that is applicable to a future reporting period. The events associated with the outflows and inflows of resources have already occurred. Under GASB standards, however, the recognition of those outflows and inflows as expenses or expenditures and revenues are deferred until the future periods to which the outflows and inflows are applicable. GASB standards identify circumstances under which deferred outflows of resources and deferred inflows of resources must be reported. The reporting of deferred inflows and outflows are only allowable under those circumstances. As applicable, the State reports deferred outflows of resources or deferred inflows of resources in the Statement of Net Position for governmental activities and business-type activities and for proprietary and fiduciary fund types as follows: A decrease or increase in the fair value of derivative instruments classified as effective hedges is presented as a deferred outflow or deferred inflow of resources, respectively, with an off-setting liability or asset, as applicable. Gains on refunded debt (i.e. the reacquisition price is less than the net carrying amount of the old debt) are reported as deferred inflows, while losses on refunded debt (i.e. the reacquisition price is greater than the net carrying amount of the old debt) are reported as deferred outflows. Both are amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the old bonds or the life of the new bonds, whichever is shorter. Differences between expected and actual experience with regard to economic and demographic factors in the measurement of the pension and OPEB liabilities for the State's proportionate share are reported as deferred inflows or deferred outflows of resources. They are amortized using a systematic and rational method over a closed period equal to the average of the expected remaining service lives of all active and inactive employees provided with pensions or OPEBs through the applicable plans. Changes of assumptions about future economic or demographic factors, or of other inputs in the measurement of the pension or OPEB liabilities for the State's proportionate share, are reported as deferred inflows or deferred outflows of resources. They are amortized using a systematic and rational method over a closed period equal to the average of the expected remaining service lives of all active and inactive employees provided with pensions or OPEBs through the applicable plans.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 57Differences between projected and actual earnings on the State's proportionate share of pension or OPEB plan investments, if any, are reported as deferred inflows or deferred outflows of resources and amortized using a systematic and rational method over a closed five-year period. Changes in the State's proportionate share of the pension or OPEB liabilities since the prior measurement date, and differences between actual and proportionate share of contributions are reported as deferred inflows or deferred outflows of resources. They are amortized using a systematic and rational method over a closed period equal to the average expected remaining service lives of all active and inactive employees provided with pensions or OPEBs through the applicable plans. Contributions to the pension or OPEB plans from the State subsequent to the measurement date of the pension or OPEB liabilities and before the end of the State's fiscal year end are reported as deferred outflows of resources. State resources transmitted to an entity before time requirements are met, but after all other eligibility requirements have been met, are reported as a deferred outflow of resources. Federal or other entities' resources transmitted to the State before time requirements are met, but after all other eligibility requirements have been met, are reported as deferred inflows of resources. When asset retirement obligations (ARO) are recognized, a corresponding deferred outflow of resources is also recognized and reduced in a systematic and rational manner over the estimated useful life of the capital asset. Further, governmental fund types may report deferred inflows of resources for unavailable revenue, such as derived nonexchange revenue transactions (e.g. sales tax, income tax, assessments on earnings and consumption, etc.). These inflows are not deferred in the government-wide financial statements; rather, they are recognized as revenue. 15. Fund Balance Classification and Restricted Net Position Fund Balance Classification In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report fund balance classifications that comprise a hierarchy based primarily on the extent to which the state is bound to honor constraints on the specific purposes for which amounts in those funds can be spent. Fund balance is reported as restricted when constraints placed on the use of the resources are either externally imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments; or, imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation.Amounts that may be used only for specific purposes, pursuant to constraints imposed by passage of a bill by both houses of the legislature that is signed into law by the governor, are reported as committed fund balance. Those committed amounts cannot be used for any other purpose unless a bill passes both houses of the legislature and is signed by the governor to remove or change the specified use. Passage of a bill by both houses of the legislature and signing of the bill by the governor is the highest level action that results in committed fund balance. Amounts that are constrained by the state's intent to be used for specific purposes, but are neither restricted nor committed, are classified as assigned fund balances. Intent is expressed by state officials to whom the state has delegated the authority to assign amounts to be used for specific purposes. Unassigned fund balance represents fund balance that has not been restricted, committed, or assigned to specific purposes within the General Fund. Unassigned fund balance may also include negative balances for any governmental fund if expenditures exceed amounts restricted, committed, or assigned for those purposes. Nonspendable fund balances include amounts that cannot be spent because they are either not in spendable form or are legally or contractually required to be maintained intact. When both restricted and unrestricted resources are available for use it is the State's policy to use restricted resources first, and then unrestricted as they are needed. The state has not established a policy for use of unrestricted fund balance. Under the provisions of GASB Statement No. 54, Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions , if a government does not establish a policy for its use of unrestricted fund balance amounts, committed amounts would be reduced first, followed by assigned amounts, and then unassigned amounts. Restricted Net Position Restricted Net Position, presented in the government-wide and proprietary funds statement of net position are reported when constraints placed on use are either (1) externally imposed by creditors (such as through debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other governments, or (2) imposed by law through constitutional provisions or enabling legislation. Enabling legislation authorizes the government to assess, levy, charge, or otherwise mandate payment of resources (from external resource providers) and includes a legally enforceable requirement that those resources be used only for the specific purposes stipulated in the legislation. Unrestricted net position may be used at the State's discretion but may have limitations on use based on State statutes.State of Wisconsin Notes to the Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 58 NOTE 2. DETAILED RECONCILIATION OF THE GOVERNMENT-WIDE AND FUND STATEMENTS A.Explanation of Differences Between the Balance Sheet - Governmental Funds and the Statement of Net Position During the year ended June 30, 2022 , the following adjustments and reclassifications were necessary to reconcile the information from the fund-based Balance Sheet - Governmental Funds to the amounts presented in the governmental activities section of the Statement of Net Position (in thousands). The differences result primarily from the long-term economic focus of the Statement of Net Position compared to the current financial focus of the Balance Sheet - Governmental Funds.

In contrast, the Statement of Net Position has a long-term economic focus and reports on all capital and financial resources. (2) The adjustment for internal service funds reflects the reclassification of these funds for the government-wide statement. The assets and liabilities of these funds are reported as proprietary activities on the fund statements, but are included as governmental activities on the Statement of Net Position. (3) Various reclassifications are necessary due to the differing level of detail needed on each of the statements. Eliminations are done on the Statement of Net Position to minimize the grossing-up effect on assets and liabilities within the governmental and business- type activities columns of the primary government. The net residual amounts due between governmental and business-type activities are shown as internal balances.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 60B.

Long-term expense differences arise because governmental funds report operating expenses (including interest) using the modified accrual basis of accounting, while government-wide statements report using the accrual basis of accounting. (2) Capital-related adjustments consist of the difference between proceeds for the sales of capital assets and the gain or loss from the sales of capital assets, and from the difference between capital outlay expenditures recorded in the governmental funds and depreciation expense recorded in the government- wide statements. (3) The adjustment for internal service funds reflects the elimination of these funds from the government-wide statement, which is accomplished by charging/ refunding additional amounts to participating governmental activities to completely offset the internal service funds' cost for the year.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 61Internal Service Funds (3)Long-term Debt Transactions (4) Eliminations (5)Revenue/Expense Reclassifications (6)Total Amount for Statement of Activities $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 12,902,644 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 7,827,191 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 378,193 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 382,523 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1,120,012 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 118,830 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (17,413,392) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 56,109 16,466,853 \u2014 (60,734) 12,097 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (22,905) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 464,799 464,800 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (124,521) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (339,373) \u2014 217,582 \u2014 104,114 906 43,683,111 (109) \u2014 \u2014 (132) 516,392 146,920 751 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 76,245 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1,591,184 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 1,074,920 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (755,352) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 9,189 \u2014 (906,627) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (52,388) \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 38,371 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 543,481 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 (3,393) (377,163) \u2014 (906) (1,420,718) $ 210,839 $ 469,603 (9,558) 5,170,774 9,558 \u2014 $ \u2014 $ 5,170,774 (4) Long-term debt transaction differences consist of bond proceeds and principal repayments reported as other financing sources and expenditures in governmental funds, but as increases and decreases in liabilities in the government-wide statements. (5) Intra-entity activity within the same function is eliminated to remove the grossing up of both direct expenses and program revenues within that category. (6) Revenue and expense reclassifications are necessary due to the differing level of detail needed on each of the statements. In addition, the Statement of Activities focuses on program revenue, which has been redefined from the traditional revenue source categories.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 62NOTE 3. BUDGETARY CONTROL The legal level of budgetary control for Wisconsin is at the function, agency, program, appropriation-level. Supplemental appropriations require the approval of the Joint Finance Committee of the Legislature. Routine adjustments, such as pay plan supplements and rent increases, are distributed by the Division of Executive Budget and Finance from non-agency specific appropriations authorized by the Legislature. Various supplemental appropriations were approved during the year and have been incorporated into the budget figures. The budgetary comparison schedule and related disclosures for the General and Transportation funds are reported as Required Supplementary Information. This schedule presents the original budget, the final budget and actual data of the current period. The related disclosures describe the budgetary practices of the State, as well as, provide a detailed reconciliation between the General and Transportation funds' equity balance on the budgetary basis compared to the GAAP basis as shown on the governmental fund statements. NOTE 4. DEFICIT FUND BALANCE/FUND NET POSITION, RESTRICTED NET POSITION, BUDGET STABILIZATION ARRANGEMENT, MINIMUM FUND BALANCE POLICY, AND FUND BALANCE OF GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS A. Deficit Fund Balance/Fund Net Position Funds reporting a deficit fund balance or net position at June 30, 2022 are (in thousands): Special Revenue: Dry Cleaner Environmental Response $ 6,256 Capital Projects: Capital Improvement 15,362 Enterprise: Northern Developmental Disabilities Center 12,341 Internal Service: Accumulated Sick Leave Basic Plan 254,144 Fleet Services 1,995 Human Resource Services 6,340 Risk Management 128,470 B. Restricted Net Position GASB Statement No. 46, Net Assets Restricted by Enabling Legislation, which amends GASB Statement No. 34, Basic Financial Statements - and Management's Discussion and Analysis - for State and Local Governments, provides guidance for determining when net assets have been restricted to a particular use by the passage of enabling legislation and how those net assets should be reported in financial statements when there are changes in the circumstances surrounding such legislation. Net position restricted by enabling legislation was as follows on June 30, 2022 (in thousands): Governmental Activities: Net Position Restricted by Enabling Legislation $ 1,284,122 Business-type Activities: Net Position Restricted by Enabling Legislation 2,070,873 C. Budget Stabilization Arrangement Wisconsin Statutes 25.60 establishes a stabilization arrangement for monies to be set aside for use if General Fund revenues are less than projected and expenditures exceed budgeted amounts. Wisconsin Statutes 16.518 provides for the automatic transfer of 50.0 percent of the excess of General Fund tax revenues over tax estimates to be deposited into a stabilization appropriation. However, the transfer may not be made if the stabilization balance is at least equal to 5.0 percent of estimated General Fund expenditures for the fiscal year. Further, the transfer may not reduce the General Fund balance below the required statutory balance. In addition to the transfer described, under Wisconsin Statutes 16.72(4) net proceeds from the sale of supplies, materials and equipment are also to be deposited into the stabilization appropriation except as otherwise provided by law. Wisconsin Statutes 16.50(7) provides that if the secretary of the Department of Administration determines that previously authorized expenditures under the biennial budget act will exceed revenues in the current or forthcoming fiscal year by more than one-half of one percent of the estimated general purpose revenue appropriations for that fiscal year, he or she shall immediately notify the governor, the presiding officers of each house of the legislature and the joint committee on finance. Following such notification, the governor shall submit a bill containing recommendations for correcting the imbalance between projected revenues and authorized expenditures, including a recommendation as to whether moneys should be transferred from the budget stabilization appropriation to the General Fund. The balance of the budget stabilization arrangement as of June 30, 2022 was $1.7 billion. There was no transfer to the budget stabilization fund in fiscal year 2022 since the current balance exceeded 5.0 percent of the estimated General Fund expenditures for the fiscal year. D. Minimum Fund Balance Wisconsin Statutes 20.003(4) establishes a minimum General Fund balance. Under the statutes, no bill directly or indirectly affecting general purpose revenues as defined in Wisconsin Statues 20.001(2)(a) may be enacted by the legislature if the bill would cause the estimated General Fund balance on June 30 of any fiscal year to be an amount equal to or less than the amount specified for that fiscal year. The minimum required balance for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022 was $90.0 million.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 63E.

DEPOSITS AND INVESTMENTS The State maintains a short-term investment \"pool\", the State Investment Fund, for the State, its agencies and departments, and certain other public institutions which elect to participate. The investment \"pool\" is managed by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (the Board) which is further authorized to carry out investment activities for certain enterprise, trust and custodial funds. A small number of State agencies also carry out investment activities separate from the Board. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board also issues separate financial reports for the investments they manage, including the State Investment Fund (SIF), and the Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS). Copies of the separately issued financial reports may be obtained at www.swib.state.wi.us or by writing to: State of Wisconsin Investment Board P.O. Box 7842 Madison, WI 53707-7842 The Department of Employee Trust Funds issues separate financial reports for the State of Wisconsin Public Employees Deferred Compensation Plan and Trust (Deferred Compensation). Copies of the separately issued financial reports may be obtained at etf.wi.gov or by writing to: Department of Employee Trust Funds P.O. Box 7931 Madison, WI 53707-7931 A.Deposits Deposits include cash and cash equivalents on deposit in banks or other financial institutions, and nonnegotiable certificates of deposit. The majority of the State's deposits are under the control of the Department of Administration. The Department of Administration maintains multiple accounts with an agreement with the bank that allows an overdraft in one account if the overdraft is offset by balances in other accounts. Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the event of a bank failure, the government's deposits may not be returned to it. The State's policy regarding custodial credit risk is detailed in Chapter 34 of the State Statutes. In brief, any federal or state bank, credit union or savings bank may be designated a public depository. A surety bond may be required. The State's insured deposits are covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and an appropriation for losses on public deposits. In the event of loss, the division of banking makes payments up to $400,000 per depositor for the excess of the payments made by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Wisconsin Credit Union Savings Insurance Corporation. Payments are made, until the funds available in the appropriation are exhausted, in the order in which satisfactory proofs of loss are received by the State's Department of Financial Institutions. 1.Primary Government As of June 30, 2022 , $580.6 million of the primary government's bank balance of $593.0 million was exposed to custodial credit risk as follows (in millions):Uninsured and uncollateralized $ 580.6 Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect the fair value of a deposit. Deposits in foreign currency at June 30, 2022 are immaterial. The primary government does not have a formal policy specifically related to foreign currency risk. The State's Unemployment Reserve Fund had $1.3 billion on deposit with the U.S. Treasury. This amount is presented as \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" and is not included in the carrying amount of deposits nor is it categorized according to risk because it is neither a deposit with a financial institution nor an investment. Certificates of Deposit are carried at cost as they are considered nonparticipating interest-earning investment contracts. Because they are valued at cost, they are not included in the fair value hierarchy established by GASB Statement 72, Fair Value Measurement and Application. 2.Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) As of December 31, 2021 , WRS cash deposits totaled $620.7 million. Of the total deposits, $123.4 million was collateralized by the securities borrowed. Depository insurance covered another $36.2 million of the total. The remaining deposits, totaling $461.1 million, were uninsured and uncollateralized. These uninsured deposits represented balances held in foreign currencies in the WRS custodian's nominee name, cash posted as collateral for derivatives transactions, and cash collateral posted in excess of the market value of securities borrowed by the WRS for short sales. In addition to cash deposits, the WRS also held $24.0 million in certificates of deposit. 3.Deferred Compensation Cash and cash equivalents for the Deferred Compensation Fund represent the balance of the FDIC Bank Option. The FDIC Bank option provides safety of principal and a stable credited rate of interest and is insured up to $250,000 per participant. As of December 31, 2021 , 83 individual participant accounts held more than $250,000. 4.State Investment Fund The State of Wisconsin appropriation for losses on public deposits protects a depositing municipality up to $400,000 (or less if the appropriation is exhausted) on its proportionate share of all losses of principal invested, if the local governing body has designated the Local Government Investment Pool (LGIP) as a public depository. The actual coverage of these deposits can fluctuate daily based on the allocable share of participants' accounts. In addition, the SIF held time deposits with financial institutions with a fair value of $150.0 million, all of which were uncollateralized and uninsured on June 30, 2022.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 65B.Investments 1.Primary Government Wisconsin Statutes, program policy provisions, appropriate governing boards, and general resolutions contained in revenue bond indenture documents define the types of securities authorized as appropriate investments and the conditions for making investment transactions. Investments of the State are managed by various portfolios. For disclosure purposes, the following investment portfolios are discussed separately: Primary government, excluding the University of Wisconsin System, Wisconsin Retirement System and the State Investment Fund. The primary government portfolios include funds separately managed by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board consisting of the following: -- State Life Insurance Fund (SLIF) -- Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund (IPFCF) -- Historical Society Fund The University of Wisconsin System (UWS) State of Wisconsin Public Employees Deferred Compensation Plan and Trust (Deferred Compensation) Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) State Investment Fund (SIF) -- functions as the State's cash management fund by \"pooling\" the idle cash balances of all State funds and other public institutions. Investments of the SIF are discussed in section B2 of this note disclosure. Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) For the primary government, except for the Separately Managed Funds discussed later, permitted investments include: direct general obligations of the United States of America and obligations (including obligations of any federal agency or corporation) for which the payment of the principal and interest are unconditionally guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the United States; bonds or other obligations of any state or the United States of America or of any agency, instrumentality or local governmental unit of any such state including the State of Wisconsin; bonds, debentures, participation certificates, notes or similar evidences of indebtedness of any of the Federal Financing Bank, Federal Home Loan Bank System, Federal Farm Credit Bank, Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Resolution Funding Corporation, Government National Mortgage Association, Student Loan Marketing Association or Tennessee Valley Authority; public housing bonds issued by public agencies or municipalities; commercial paper; interest-bearing time deposits, certificates of deposit or other similar banking arrangements; shares of a diversified open-end management investment company; repurchase agreements; common and preferred stock; banker's acceptances; corporate commercial paper; bonds issued by a local district created under Wisconsin Act 229; and investment agreements with a bank, bank holding company, insurance company or other financial institution. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB or the Board) has control of the investment and collection of principal, interest, and dividends of all monies invested of the State Life Insurance Fund (SLIF), the Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund (IPFCF), and the Historical Society Trust Fund, which are collectively known as the \"Separately Managed Funds\".Permitted classes of investments of the SLIF and the IPFCF include bonds of government units or of corporations, loans secured by mortgages, preferred or common stocks, real property and other investments not specifically prohibited by statute. Funds available for the Historical Society Trust Fund are managed with an investment objective of maintaining a diversified portfolio of high quality publicly issued equities and fixed income obligations providing long-term growth in capital and income generation. University of Wisconsin System (UWS) The UWS Board of Regents authorize and govern the UWS investment policies and guidelines. Beginning in FY 2018, the UWS Board of Regents has delegated investment management authority to SWIB and is responsible for monitoring its delegation of this investment management authority. SWIB determines and sets UWS asset allocation targets which are reviewed quarterly. In addition, UWS continues to have an allocation to private markets through a \"legacy\" portfolio that will self-liquidate over time as investments are sold and cash proceeds are received. The University Cash Management Fund was established in 2022 in accordance with the investment policies and guidelines governed and authorized by the UWS Board of Regents, and is currently distributed among fixed income funds, bank loans, and global equities. The objective of the Cash Management Fund is to manage principal, ensure liquidity for anticipated needs, and maintain purchasing power for existing assets. Target allocations were approved by the University Investment Committee in January 2022. The Cash Management Fund is an intermediate portfolio, governed by and subject to a Memorandum of Understanding between University of Wisconsin System Administration and the University of Wisconsin Madison. An internally managed investment fund was established for a limited and select number of participating Trust Funds accounts by the University Board of Regents to provide an educational investment management opportunity for the UW-Madison School of Business's Applied Security Analysis Program. The \"RegentFund\" is an intermediate-term fixed income portfolio, governed by and subject to a Board-approved Memorandum of Understanding, which includes detailed investment guidelines. The UWS also issues separate financial reports. Copies of these separately issued financial reports may be obtained at www.wisconsin.edu or by writing to: Office of Financial Administration 780 Regent Street, Suite 255 Madison, WI 53715 Deferred Compensation The State of Wisconsin Public Employees Deferred Compensation Plan and Trust (Deferred Compensation) was established in 1981 pursuant to Wisconsin State Statute Section 40.80. Deferred Compensation is governed by the Wisconsin Deferred Compensation Board and is administered by a third party. Under Deferred Compensation Plan provisions, employees of the State of Wisconsin and public employers in Wisconsin that elect to participate are eligible to contribute to the Plan through payroll deductions. Employees electing to participate in the plan may State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 66contribute to or exchange within several available investment options. Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) All assets of the WRS are invested by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (the Board). The WRS consists of shares in the Core Retirement Investment Trust and the Variable Retirement Investment Trust. The investments of the Core Retirement Investment Trust consist of a diversified portfolio of securities. Wis. Stat. Sec. 25.182 authorizes the Board to manage the Core Retirement Investment Trust in accordance with \"prudent investor\" standard of responsibility as described in Wis. Stat. Sec. 25.15(2) which requires that the Board manage the funds with the diligence, skill and care that a prudent person acting in a similar capacity and with the same resources would use in managing a large public pension fund. Investments of the Variable Retirement Investment Trust are authorized under Wis. Stat. Sec. 25.15 and 25.17. Wis. Stat. Sec. 25.17(5) states assets of the Variable Retirement Investment Trust shall be invested primarily in equity securities which shall include common stocks, real estate or other recognized forms of equities whether or not subject to indebtedness, including securities convertible into common stocks and securities of corporations in the venture capital stage. The Variable Retirement Investment Trust consists primarily of common stock and bonds convertible into common stock, although, because of existing conditions in the securities market, there may temporarily be other types of investments. Valuation Investments of the State are reported at Fair Value as defined by GASB Statement Number 72 - Fair Value Measurement and Application and are categorized based on the investment valuation hierarchy established by GASB. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure the fair value of the assets. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 inputs are significant other observable inputs. Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs. The fair value of investments are obtained or estimated using information provided by custodial banks and brokerages. A variety of independent pricing sources are used to price assets based on type, class or issue, including published quotations from active markets, pricing models and other methods deemed acceptable by industry standards.Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) The following tables present fair value measurements as of June 30, 2022 , in millions: Primary Government (excluding the Separately Managed Funds) Fair Value Measurement Using Fair ValueLevel 1 InputsLevel 2 InputsLevel 3 Inputs Investments by Fair Value Level: U.S. Government & Agency Securities $ 189.6 $ 76.0 $ 113.6 $ \u2014 State or Municipal Bonds & Notes 103.7 \u2014 103.7 \u2014 Corporate and Other Bonds and Notes 12.4 \u2014 12.4 \u2014 Closed-End Funds 4.0 4.0 \u2014 \u2014 Exchange Traded Funds 387.7 387.7 \u2014 \u2014 Equity Securities 33.0 33.0 \u2014 \u2014 Limited Partnership 287.7 \u2014 \u2014 287.7 Total By Fair Value Level $ 1,018.1 $ 500.8 $ 229.6 $ 287.7 Investments Valued at Net Asset Value (NAV): Money Market Funds $ 402.8 Mutual Funds 121.9 Investments Valued at Cost: Private Placement 7.1 U.S. Government & Agency Securities 0.2 Long-Term CDs $ 1.1 Total $ 1,551.2 State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 67The following tables present fair value measurements as of June 30, 2022 for the Separately Managed Funds, in millions: Separately Managed Funds Fair Value Measurement Using Total Level 1 Level 2 IPFCF Investments by Fair Value Level: U.S. Government and Agency Securities$ 658.0 $ 6.5 $ 651.5 Corporate Bonds 449.3 \u2014 449.3 Municipal Bonds 20.5 \u2014 20.5 Foreign Bonds 42.0 \u2014 42.0 Total by Fair Value Level $ 1,169.8 $ 6.5 $ 1,163.3 Investments Valued at Net Asset Value (NAV): Equity Index Funds $ 200.0 Short-Term Investment Fund 10.6 Total IPFCF $ 1,380.4 Historical Society Investments Reported at Net Asset Value (NAV): Equity Index Fund $ 16.2 Fixed Income Fund 5.1 Total Historical Society $ 21.2 SLIF Investments by Fair Value Level: U.S. Government and Agency Securities$ 44.3 $ \u2014 $ 44.3 Corporate Bonds 55.1 55.1 Total by Fair Value Level $ 99.4 $ \u2014 $ 99.4 Investments Reported at Net Asset Value (NAV): U.S. Fixed Income Fund $ 2.0 Total SLIF $ 101.4 Securities categorized as Level 1 are valued using prices quoted in active markets for those securities. Debt securities categorized as Level 2 are valued by third party pricing services using a matrix-pricing technique that values securities based on their relationship to quoted market prices for securities with similar interest rates, maturities and credit ratings. Securities categorized as Level 3 include certain Limited Partnership interests in the amount of $ 287.7 million held by the Common School and Normal School funds. These limited partnerships invest in small non-public companies. Shares may typically be redeemed through the investment manager, though the ability to redeem shares may be curtailed during an acute financial crisis. The Common School fund has committed to invest up to $166.0 million in limited partnerships as of June 30, 2022 . The Injured Patients and Families Compensation fund holds Investments in the amount of $10.6 million in the Short-Term Investment Fund, a short-term investment pool. Investments of the Short-Term Investment Fund are reported at net asset value (NAV). Fair values of investments in equity and fixed income co-mingled index funds, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts, and money market funds are based on the investments' published NAV per share (or its equivalent) provided by the investee. These investments are considered Level 1 in the GASB fair value hierarchy. Investments Valued at Cost or Amortized Cost \u2014 Certain investments are valued at cost or amortized cost. Investments valued at cost are not included in the GASB fair value hierarchy. Of the $ 0.2 million of U.S. Government and Agency Securities reported at amortized cost, $0.1 million represents U.S. Government Savings Bonds.

Private Fund Investments Private Fund Investments include private equity and real estate. Private Equity Limited Partnerships participated in the following investment strategies at December 31, 2021 : Leveraged Buyout - This strategy acquires the controlling interest of a private company using a significant amount of borrowed capital (leverage). Distressed Debt - This strategy can invest in public and private companies undergoing financial distress, a turnaround in business operations, or which are believed to be undervalued because of a discrete extraordinary event. Growth Equity - This Strategy is an investment opportunity in relatively mature companies that are going through a transformational event in their lifecycle with potential for significant growth. Venture Capital - This strategy invests in companies with potential for significant growth (generally small to early stage emerging firms). Private Debt - This strategy includes any debt held by or extended to privately held companies. The debt securities can be senior debt, mezzanine debt, and structured capital but commonly involve non-bank institutions making loans to private companies or buying those loans on the secondary market. Secondaries - This strategy provides a market for investors to sell or purchase positions in private market funds. Real Estate Limited Partnerships generally consisted of the following investment strategies at December 31, 2021 :State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 71Core - Core investments are expected to deliver a significant percentage of their return from income and should demonstrate lower volatility than Opportunistic and Value investments due to lower leverage, higher occupancy, and asset location. Value - Value investments typically have significant near-term leasing, repositioning, and/or renovation risk. This strategy is expected to have modest initial operating revenues with potential for substantial income growth and will likely encounter greater volatility than Core strategies, but lower volatility than Opportunistic strategies. Opportunistic - Opportunistic investments usually have significant development, lease-up, financial restructuring, and/or liquidity risk with little or no initial operating income. This strategy typically uses the highest leverage, is expected to achieve most of its return from future capital gains, and is likely to encounter greater volatility than Core and Value strategies. Hedge Funds Hedge Fund investments are private investment funds that seek to produce absolute returns using a broad range of strategies. When redeeming Hedge Fund investments, the agreements governing the investment often require advanced notice and may restrict the timing of withdrawals. Hedge Fund agreements can also include \"lock-up\" periods, which restrict investors from redeeming their investment during a specified time frame. The lock-up period helps portfolio managers mitigate liquidity risks. Lock-ups can be \"hard,\" where redemptions are not permitted for a specified time period, or \"soft,\" where redemptions are permitted provided the investor pays a penalty. In certain instances, a fund may have both hard and soft lock-up restrictions in place. In addition, hedge fund managers can also institute a \"rolling\" lock-up. A fund with a rolling lock-up period requires investors to commit to an initial lock-up period, and, if the investor does not submit a redemption notice within a set time prior to expiration of the lock-up, the lock-up is reset. Similar to lock-ups, Hedge Fund agreements also commonly incorporate \"gate\" restrictions. An investor-level gate limits redemption on a particular redemption date to a specified percentage of the investor's account value, while a fund-level gate may limit total investor withdrawals on a particular redemption date to a percentage of aggregated fund-level (or master fund level) net asset value. In certain instances, funds can have both investor- and fund-level gates in place. The WRS participated in the following Hedge Fund strategies at December 31, 2021 : Long-Short Equity - This strategy invests both long and short in publicly-traded stocks. These managers vary in their use of short selling and leverage. Event-Driven - This strategy seeks to gain an advantage from pricing inefficiencies that may occur before or after a corporate action or related event, such as a merger, spinoff, earnings call, bankruptcy, or restructuring. Tactical Trading - This strategy invests in indices, commodities, interest rate instruments, and currencies as a result of relative value or directional forecasts from a systematic or discretionary approach.Relative Value - This strategy uses a range of fixed income arbitrage, insurance linked, long/short credit, and/or quantitative strategies that seek to take advantage of price differentials. Multistrategy - The funds in this category employ a wide range of strategies and instruments in managing assets. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS and SIF) The primary government, except for the Separately Managed Funds discussed later, follows Wisconsin Statutes, program policy provisions, appropriate governing boards, and general resolutions contained in revenue bond indenture documents limits investments in public housing bonds issued by public agencies or municipalities, the State of Wisconsin, interest-bearing time deposits, certificates of deposit or other similar banking arrangement, shares of a diversified open-end management investment company repurchase agreements and investment agreements to a rating no lower than the rating assigned to the bonds. Investments in all other permitted debt securities are required to bear the highest rating available from each nationally recognized rating agency. In addition, credit risk of certain funds such as the Retiree Life Insurance Fund is minimized by monitoring portfolio diversification by asset class, creditor and industry and by complying with investment limitations governed by insurance laws and regulations. Regarding the Separately Managed Funds, investment guidelines require that the bond portfolios shall maintain an average quality rating of A- or better at time of purchase, using the lower of split ratings at the time of purchase.

Fixed income credit risk investment guidelines outline the minimum ratings required at the time of purchase by individual portfolios, or groups of portfolios, based on the portfolios' investment objectives. In addition, some fixed income portfolios are required to always carry a minimum weighted average rating. The following schedule displays the lowest credit rating assigned by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations on debt securities held as of December 31, 2021 (in millions). WRS Rating Commingled Fixed Income Funds 6,843.3 Total $ 54,684.6 Reverse Repurchase Agreements Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) The WRS held $17.0 billion in reverse repurchase agreements at December 31, 2021 . Investment guidelines permit certain portfolios to enter into reverse repurchase agreements, which are a sale of securities with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the securities in the future at the same price plus a stated rate of interest. The market value of the securities underlying reverse repurchase agreements exceeds the cash received, providing the counterparty a margin against a decline in market value of the securities. If the counterparty defaults on their obligations to sell these securities back to the WRS or provide cash of equal value, the WRS could suffer an economic loss equal to the difference between the market value of the underlying securities plus accrued interest and the agreement obligation, including accrued interest. This credit exposure at December 31, 2021 was $130.5 million. The WRS enters into reverse repurchase agreements with various counterparties and such transactions are governed by Master Repurchase Agreements (MRA). MRAs are negotiated contracts and contain terms in which the WRS seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk. The WRS also controls credit exposures by limiting trades with any one counterparty to stipulated amounts. The counterparty credit exposure is managed through the transfer of margin, in the form of cash or securities, between the WRS and the counterparty. The cash proceeds from reverse repurchase agreements are reinvested by the Retirement Funds. The maturities of the purchases made with the proceeds of reverse repurchase State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 73agreements are not necessarily matched to the maturities of the agreements. The agreed-upon yields earned by the counterparty were between 0.07 percent and 0.22 percent at December 31, 2021 . Portfolio guidelines require agreements to mature between one and 90 days. Custodial Credit Risk Custodial credit risk is the risk that, in the event of a failure of the counterparty, the State will not be able to recover the value of the investment or collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) The primary government, including the Separately Managed Funds, does not have an investment policy specifically for custodial credit risk. As of June 30, 2022 , the primary government did not have any direct investment securities exposed to custodial credit risk. Deferred Compensation The Stable Value fund, CIT Funds, and Mutual Funds do not have securities that are used as evidence of the investments and therefore are not exposed to custodial credit risk. Deferred Compensation does not have a formal policy for custodial credit risk. Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) The WRS held repurchase agreements totaling $268.8 million as of December 31, 2021 . These repurchase agreements were tri- party agreements held in a short-term cash management portfolio managed by the WRS's custodian. The underlying securities for these agreements were held by the tri-party agent, not in the WRS's name. The WRS's custodial credit risk policy addresses the primary risks associated with safekeeping and custody. It requires that the WRS's custodial institution be selected through a competitive bid process and that the institution be designated a \"Systemically Important Financial Institution\" by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The policy also requires that the WRS be reflected as beneficial owner on all securities entrusted to the custodian and that the WRS have access to safekeeping and custody accounts. The custodian is also required to carry insurance covering errors and omissions and must provide the WRS with an annual report on internal controls, prepared in accordance with the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements. In addition, WRS management has established a system of controls for the oversight of services and related processes performed by the custodian. The WRS's current custodial bank was selected in accordance with these guidelines and meets all requirements stipulated in the custodial credit risk policy. Concentration of Credit Risk Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of a government's investment in a single issuer. Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) Although the primary government, except for the Separately Managed Funds discussed later, does not have a formal policy on limiting the exposure to concentrations of credit risk, it is the primary government's policy to comply with the provisions contained within the general resolutions of revenue bond indentures and other program policy investment criteria. Debt securities issued by the State of Wisconsin represent the largest concentration of investments in a single issuer. In total, approximately $30.9 million of the reported investments of the permanent funds (a category within non-major governmental funds) were issued by the State of Wisconsin, which represents approximately 3.0 percent of their total investments. The Separately Managed Funds' investment guidelines limit concentrations of credit risk by establishing maximum issuer and/ or sector exposure limits. Generally, the guidelines require that no single issuer may exceed 5.0 percent of the fund investments, with the exception of U.S. Government and its Agencies, whose exposure is unlimited. Excluding investments issued or explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government and pooled investments, as of June 30, 2022 , none of the Separately Managed Funds had more than 5.0 percent of their total investments in a single issuer. University of Wisconsin System (UWS) UWS separately managed, debt/fixed income accounts are limited to holding no more than 5.0 percent in any one issuer (U.S. Government/Agencies were exempted). Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) For investments of the WRS, concentration of credit risk is limited by establishing investment guidelines for individual portfolios or groups of portfolios that generally restrict issuer concentrations in any one company or Rule 144A securities to less than 5.0 percent of the portfolio's market value. The WRS did not hold any investments with a single issuer, exclusive of investments issued or explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, representing 5.0 percent or more of the value of the total WRS investments' value at December 31, 2021 . Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates of debt investments will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) Although the primary government, except for the Separately Managed Funds discussed later, does not have a formal policy on limiting the exposure to changes in interest rates, it is the primary government's policy to comply with the provisions contained within the general resolutions of revenue bond indentures and other program policy investment criteria. For example, the Lottery Fund acquires investments with maturity dates that significantly coincide with scheduled payment dates of prize annuities. Investments are held to maturity unless an annuitant requests premature termination of an annuity, then any loss or gain due to market fluctuations are passed through to the redeeming annuitant. Therefore, the Lottery Fund has minimal interest rate risk exposure. Further, as a means of limiting its exposure to interest rate risks, certain funds are required to limit at least half of the fund's investment portfolio to maturities of less than one year. In addition, interest rate risk of certain other funds such as the State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 74Retiree Life Insurance Fund is minimized by maintaining a diversified portfolio of investments and monitoring cash flow patterns in order to approximately match the expected maturity of liabilities. The following table provides information about the interest rate risks associated with the primary government's investments, except those of the Separately Managed Funds. The investments include certain short-term cash equivalents, and various long-term items. At June 30, 2022 , the primary government's investments were (in millions): Primary Government (excluding the Separately Managed Funds, UWS, WRS, SIF, and investments in an external investment pool) Investment Maturities Investment TypeFair ValueLess Than 1 Year1 to 5 Years6 to 10 yearsMore Than 10 Years U.S. Government and U.S. Agency holdings $ 189.8 $ 93.3 $ 1.8 $ 0.5 $ 94.1 State and municipal bonds and notes 103.7 1.5 4.3 30.7 67.2 Other Bonds and Notes 12.4 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 12.4 Money market funds 402.8 402.8 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Mutual funds - open ended 0.3 \u2014 \u2014 0.2 \u2014 Private Placement 7.1 0.2 0.8 1.3 4.9 Long-Term CDs 1.1 1.1 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Total $ 717.1 $ 498.9 $ 6.9 $ 32.7 $ 178.6 State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 75As of June 30, 2022 , the Separately Managed Funds had interest rate risk statistics as detailed below (in millions): Separately Managed Funds Duration or WAM (in years) for Fixed Income Securities Investment Type IPFCF Historical Society SLIF Fair Value Duration Fair Value Duration Fair Value WAM Govt/Agency $ 658.0 6.01 $ \u2014 $ 44.3 15.70 Corporate Bonds 449.3 7.23 \u2014 55.1 13.22 Municipal Bonds 20.5 9.97 \u2014 \u2014 Foreign Bonds (Govt/Agency) 42.0 4.87 \u2014 \u2014 Bond Fund \u2014 5.1 6.67 2.0 13.27 Short-Term Investment Fund 10.6 0.06 \u2014 \u2014 Total $ 1,180.4 $ 5.1 $ 101.4 The Separately Managed Funds, which are managed by the Board, use the duration method to identify and manage interest rate risk. Two of the Separately Managed Funds have investment guidelines relating to interest rate risk. The SLIF guidelines require the Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) of the portfolio, including cash, to be a minimum of ten years. The IPFCF guidelines require that effective duration of the bond portfolio shall remain within 15% of the assigned benchmark's duration and that the average duration should be less than ten years. External Investment Pools The Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund has investments totaling $ 10.6 million at June 30, 2022 in the Short- Term Investment Fund, a pooled short-term investment fund. This balance is reported as \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" on the Statement of Net Position. Investments for the Retiree Life Insurance Funds are held with the insurance carrier, Securian. In accordance with the administrative agreement between the GIB and Securian, interest is calculated and credited to the Retiree Life Insurance plans based on the rate of return for a segment of the insurance carrier's general fund, specifically, 10 Year A- Bonds (as a proxy and not tied to any specific investments). The funds invested during the year earn interest based on that year's rate of return for 10 Year A- Bonds. The overall aggregate interest rate is calculated using a tiered approach based on the year the funds were invested and the rate of return for that year. Investment interest is credited based on the aggregate rate of return and assets are not adjusted to fair market value. Furthermore, the insurance carrier guarantees the principal amounts of the reserves, including all interest previously credited thereto. No significant contract changes occurred during the year.Deferred Compensation Deferred Compensation uses weighted average effective duration to analyze interest rate risk.

Modified duration, which is stated in years, is the measure of price sensitivity of a fixed income security to an interest rate change of 100 basis points. The calculation is based on the weighted average of the present values for all cash flows. Some investments are analyzed using an option adjusted duration calculation which is similar to the modified duration method. Option adjusted duration incorporates the duration shortening effect of any embedded call provisions in the securities. Duration statistics are weighted by the dollar value of the position to compute an average duration for each investment type. Short-term portfolios' interest rate risk is analyzed using the weighted average maturity to next reset. Weighted average maturity is the maturity of each position in a portfolio weighted by the dollar value of the position to compute an average maturity for the portfolio as a whole. This measure indicates a portfolio's sensitivity to interest rate changes: a longer weighted average maturity implies greater volatility in response to interest rate changes.The WRS's investment guidelines related to interest rate risk vary by portfolio. Some fixed income portfolios require management within a range of a targeted duration, while others are required to maintain a weighted average maturity at or below a specified number of days or years. Aggregated interest rate risk exposure as of December 31, 2021 , stated in terms of modified duration (for long term instruments) and weighted average maturity (for repurchase agreements and short-term pooled investments), is presented below (in millions): WRS Investment Type* Fair ValueModified Duration (Years) Asset Backed Securities $ 832.9 3.3 Corporate Bonds & Private Placements 14,676.1 6.9 Foreign Government / Agency Bonds 2,268.9 7.2 Municipal Bonds 188.7 11.5 U.S. Government Agencies 2,312.7 4.8 U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities 21,183.2 7.6 U.S. Treasury Securities 5,576.7 8.5 Commingled Funds: Exchange Traded 465.9 7.6 Emerging Market Fixed Income 1,221.8 4.9 Subtotal 48,726.7 Weighted Average Maturity (days) Commercial Paper 284.3 69 Repurchase Agreements 268.8 3 Commingled Funds: Short Term Management 5,404.7 57 Subtotal 5,957.8 Total $ 54,684.6 *Excludes derivatives which are separately disclosedState of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 77Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely impact the fair value of an investment. Primary Government (excluding the UWS, WRS, and SIF) The primary government, except for the Separately Managed Funds discussed later, does not have a formal policy to limit foreign currency risk, however, certain funds such as the Environmental Improvement Fund are not permitted to invest in foreign currency based on provisions contained in its bond indenture general resolution. However, foreign currency risk of the Retiree Life Insurance Fund is minimized by utilizing short- duration spot forward contracts to minimize the adverse impact of foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in the elapsed time between trade processing and trade settlement. At June 30, 2022 , the primary government, excluding the Separately Managed Funds, did not own any issues denominated in a foreign currency. The Separately Managed Funds' investment guidelines do not specifically address foreign currency risk with the exception that the SLIF only allows investments in U.S. dollar denominated instruments. As of June 30, 2022 , the Separately Managed Funds did not directly own any issues denominated in a foreign currency. Deferred Compensation Deferred Compensation allows the option of investments in Mutual Funds and CIT Funds that make investments in foreign securities. The fair value of these investments was $512.5 million as of December 31, 2021. University of Wisconsin System (UWS) The UWS held positions only in passively-managed, indexed commingled funds which may invest in securities denominated in foreign currencies. However, the fund used for exposure to developed market equities generally seeks to hedge against the variations in returns deriving solely from the value of the foreign currencies in the fund relative to the U.S. dollar. The fund used for exposure to emerging market equities generally does not engage in similar foreign currency hedging efforts, due largely to the high cost and more limited efficacy of such hedging. Deposits in foreign currency for the RegentFund at June 30, 2022 are immaterial.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 78Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) The WRS held foreign currency denominated cash and securities directly in designated actively managed portfolios and indirectly through its investment in certain commingled invest funds.

The bank must obtain collateral from the borrower, or acceptable securities. When UWS securities are delivered to a borrower as part of a securities lending arrangement, the borrower is required to place collateral with the lending agent equal to at least 102% of the loaned securities' fair value, including interest accrued, as of the delivery date. Both the collateral and the securities loaned are marked to market on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as necessary. In the event that the loaned securities are not returned by the borrower, the bank will, at its own expense, either replace the loaned securities or, if unable to purchase those securities on the open market, credit UWS accounts with cash equal to the fair value of the loaned securities. The UWS receives 75 percent of the net revenue derived from all securities lending activities and the bank receives the remainder of the net revenue. Interest and dividend income earned in conjunction with the securities lending program is reported as part of non-operating investment income in the Statement of Revenues, Expenses, and Changes in Fund Net Position. Although the UWS securities lending activities are collateralized as described above, the securities lending program involves both market and credit risk. In this context, market risk refers to the possibility that the borrower of securities will be unable to collateralize the loan upon a sudden material change in the fair value of the loaned securities or the collateral, or that the bank's investment of collateral received from the borrowers of UWS securities may be subject to unfavorable market fluctuations. Credit risk refers to the possibility that counterparties involved in the securities lending program may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their contracts. At June 30, 2022 , the fair value of securities loaned, was $223.8 million. Collateral received consisted of $228.5 million in cash and $0.4 million in non-cash collateral. In accordance with accounting standards the value of the collateral held and a corresponding liability to return the collateral have been reported on the accompanying Statement of Net Position. Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) State statutes and Board policies permit the use of investments of the WRS to enter into securities lending transactions. These transactions involve the lending of securities to broker-dealers and other entities in exchange for collateral, in the form of cash or securities, with the simultaneous agreement to return the collateral for identical securities in the future. The securities custodian acts as an agent in lending the directly-held domestic and international securities. When securities are delivered to a borrower as part of a securities lending agreement, the borrower is required to place collateral equal to at least 102 percent of the loaned securities' fair value, including interest accrued, as of the delivery date with the lending agent. In the event that securities are loaned against collateral denominated in a different currency, the borrower is required to place collateral totaling 105 percent of the loaned securities' fair value, including interest accrued, as of the delivery date with the lending agent. Collateral is marked to market daily and adjusted as needed to maintain the required minimum level. On December 31, 2021 , the fair value of the securities on loan to counterparties was approximately $11.4 billion. Cash collateral is reinvested by the lending agent in two separate pools, a U.S. dollar cash collateral pool and a pool denominated in Euros, in accordance with contractual investment guidelines, which are designed to minimize the risk of principal loss and provide a modest rate of return. Investment guidelines limit credit and liquidity risk by restricting new investments to overnight repurchase agreements collateralized with high quality U.S. government, U.S. government agencies, and sovereign debt securities. The earnings generated from the collateral investments, plus or minus the rebates received from or paid to the dealers and less fees paid to agents, results in the net earnings from lending activities, which are then split on a percentage basis with the lending agent. Cash from the U.S. dollar pool may be posted as collateral relating to short sale transactions and it earns the Overnight Bank Funding rate plus 10 basis points. At December 31, 2021 , the WRS had minimal credit risk exposure to borrowers because loans are collateralized in excess of 100%. In addition to the cash collateral reinvestment indemnification, the contract with the lending agent requires it to indemnify the WRS if the borrowers fail to return the loaned securities and the collateral is inadequate to replace the securities lent. The WRS is also indemnified against losses resulting from violations of investment guidelines. The majority of security loans are open-ended and can be terminated on demand by the WRS or the borrower. Maturities of investments made with cash collateral are not necessarily matched to the maturities of the securities loaned because most loans do not have a fixed maturity date. The risk that the WRS would be unable to return collateral to securities borrowers upon termination of the loan is mitigated by the highly liquid nature of investments held in the collateral reinvestment pools. The average maturities of the loans and the average maturities of the assets held in the collateral reinvestment pools were similar at December 31, 2021 . Securities lending is allowed in certain commingled fund investments. As an investor in such funds, the WRS does not own the underlying securities and does not separately report on securities lending activity. All earnings of these funds are reported in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Derivative Instruments Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) Derivative instruments may be used to implement investment strategies for the Core and Variable Funds. All derivative instruments are subjected to risk analysis and monitoring processes at the portfolio, asset class and fund levels. Investment guidelines define allowable derivative activity for each portfolio and are based on the investment objectives which have been approved by the Board. Where derivative instruments are permitted, guidelines stipulate allowable instruments and the manner and degree to which they are to be used. Gains and losses for all derivative instruments are reported in the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. The WRS seeks to mitigate counterparty credit risk through counterparty credit evaluations and approvals, counterparty credit limits, and exposure monitoring procedures. Additionally, policies have been established which seek to implement master netting State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 80arrangements with counterparties that permit the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty. Agreements may also require daily collateral postings to further mitigate credit risk. As of December 31, 2021 , there were 21 counterparties making up the WRS's exposure to counterparty credit risk for uncleared OTC derivative contracts.

No cash is exchanged when a foreign exchange spot or forward contract is initiated. Amounts due are paid or received on the contracted settle date. Currency exposure management is permitted through the use of currency derivative instruments. Direct hedging of currency exposure back to the US dollar is permitted when consistent with the strategy of the portfolio. Cross-currency exposure management to transfer out of an exposed currency and into a benchmark currency is permitted. Discretionary currency overlay strategies at the total fund and asset class level may be employed when currency market conditions suggest such strategies are warranted. Losses may arise from future changes in the value of the underlying currency, or if the counterparties do not perform under the terms of the contract. Spot and forward contracts are valued daily with the changes in fair value included in \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in Fair Value of Investments\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position.

Futures contracts may be entered into for purposes such as 1) to efficiently gain or adjust market exposures for rebalancing, 2) to adjust sector, interest rate, or duration exposure, or 3) to securitize cash or as a substitute for cash market transactions. Swap Contracts - Swaps are negotiated contractual agreements between two counterparties which can be either cleared or uncleared OTC investments. As is specified in the WRS's investment guidelines, swaps may be used as an alternative to physical securities when it is deemed advantageous for portfolio construction. In addition, swaps may be used to adjust asset class exposures for the WRS. Guideline limits and soft risk parameters for each portfolio are applied to the aggregate exposures which includes both physical and synthetic securities. A synthetic security is created by combining securities to mirror the properties of another reference security.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 83Throughout the year, the WRS held positions in Total Return Swaps (TRS), Interest Rate Swaps (IRS), and Credit Default Swaps (CDS).

Under the terms of the contracts, the WRS receives (pays) periodic payments and, in exchange, agrees to pay (receive) a formula-determined amount to counterparties for losses incurred if stipulated credit events occur. CDS spreads are sensitive to credit spread and interest rate changes. The fair value of a CDS contract is determined using the closing price as reported by the applicable clearinghouse. IRS positions represent cleared OTC contracts where the fair value is determined using the closing price as reported by the applicable clearinghouse. The open TRS contracts represent uncleared OTC positions where the WRS gains exposure to the return of the underlying equity index and, in exchange, agrees to pay or receive the stipulated rate benchmark. The rate benchmark is based on the 3-month London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) or the 1-day Fed Funds Rate set by the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) and is sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value for TRS is based on the change in quoted market price of the underlying equity index and represents the unrealized gain/ (loss) on the contracts since trade inception. The fair value of CDS, IRS, and TRS is included in \"Financial Futures Contracts and Swaps\" on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. Gains and losses resulting from investments in swap contracts are included in the \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in the Fair Value of Investments\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Any interest owed but not yet paid relating to swap contracts is reported within \"Accounts Payable and Other Accrued Liabilities\" on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. Interest Expense relating to swap contracts is reported as \"Investment Expense\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Options - An option contract gives the purchaser of the contract the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) the security or index underlying the contract at an agreed upon price on or before the expiration date of the option contract. The seller of the contract is subject to market risk, while the purchaser is subject to credit risk and market risk, to the extent of the premium paid to enter into the contract. Rebalancing policies and portfolio investment guidelines permit the use of exchange-traded and over-the-counter options. Options may be used to improve market exposure efficiency, enhance expected returns, or provide market exposure hedges. Exchange rules require that the seller of short exchange-traded call option contracts cover these positions either by collateral deposits in the form of cash or by pledging, in escrow, the actual securities that would be transferred to the option purchaser in the event the options contract was exercised. In the case of OTC options, investment guidelines mitigate counterparty credit risk by establishing minimum credit ratings and requiring master netting agreements with provisions for collateral exchanges. The fair value of option contracts is based upon the closing market price of the contract and is reflected as \"Options\" on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. Gains and losses as a result of investments in option contracts are included in the \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in the Fair Value of Investments\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 84The table below presents the fair value of option contracts as of December 31, 2021 (in millions): Option Contracts Security DescriptionContract Type PositionExchange- Traded vs. OTC Expiration NotionalFair ValueUnrealized Gain (Loss) Equity Call Long Exchange Jan 22 - Mar 22 $ 14.4 $ 0.3 $ (2.9) Equity Call Short Exchange Jan 22 - Mar 22 (48.9) (0.5) 0.5 Equity Put Long Exchange Jan 22 9.4 0.1 (0.4) Equity Put Short Exchange Jan 22 (24.6) (1.7) \u2014 Equity Index Put Short Exchange Jan 22 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 OTC Index Put Short OTC Jan 22 - Feb 22 (416.9) (0.1) 0.9 Total $ (466.6) $ (1.9) $ (1.9) To Be Announced Securities - To be announced mortgage- backed (TBA) securities are uncleared OTC forward contracts consisting of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by Government National Mortgage Association, a government entity, and by government-sponsored enterprises such as, the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. The term TBA is derived from the fact that the actual MBS that will be delivered to fulfill a TBA trade is not designated at the time the trade is made. Instead, the specific pool of mortgages making up the MBS is announced 48 hours prior to the established trade settlement date. Eligibility rules and standards for MBS pools deliverable into TBA contracts ensure that delivered MBS pools are fungible. Payment for TBA securities is not made until the settlement date. Certain portfolio investment guidelines allow for both long and short TBA positions. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, guidelines establish minimum credit ratings and require master netting agreements which include provisions for collateral exchanges. TBAs, much like their underlying MBS securities, may be highly sensitive to interest rate changes. This is because the MBS pool on which these forward contracts are based can be subject to early payment in a period of declining interest rates. The price of TBAs can fluctuate as the marketplace predicts changes in timing, or possible reductions in expected cash flows, associated with a change in interest rates. The table below presents the fair value of TBA securities as of December 31, 2021 (in millions). Duration statistics are weighted by the fair value of each position to compute an average duration for the contracts held.

The unrealized gain/ loss associated with these contracts is included within the \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in the Fair Value of Investments\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Warrants \u2014 A warrant is a contract that entitles the holder to buy the underlying stock of the issuing company at a specified price. Warrants and options are similar in that the two instruments allow the holder special rights to buy securities. However, warrants differ from options in that they provide additional financing to the issuing company when exercised. As of December 31, 2021 , the WRS held warrant contracts valued at $2.3 million. Warrants are included in the \"Equities\" section on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. The associated unrealized gain of $1.2 million is included in the \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in the Fair Value of Investments\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position. Short Sell Obligations Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) The WRS may sell a security it does not own in anticipation of purchasing the security later at a lower price. This is known as a short sale transaction. For the duration of the short sale transaction, a liability is recorded under \"Short Sales of Securities\" on the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. The liability presented represents the fair value of the shorted securities necessary for delivery to the purchaser and is marked-to-market daily. Realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with short sales are recorded on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position within the \"Net Appreciation (Depreciation) in Fair Value of Investments\" category. Prior to executing a short sale, the WRS borrows the security from a party currently holding it. While the transaction is open, the WRS incurs expenses for securities borrowing costs. In addition, as a security borrower, the WRS may incur dividend and interest expense as such payments must be remitted to the security lender during the course of the loan. During the duration of the borrow, there may be corporate action elections requiring the borrower to deliver items such as cash or securities to the lender. Such expenses are included in \"Investment Expense\" on the Statement of Changes in Fiduciary Net Position.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 85Risks arise from short sales due to the possible illiquidity of the securities markets and from potential adverse movements in security values. The cost to acquire the securities sold short may exceed the amount of proceeds initially received, as well as the amount of the liability recorded as \"Short Sales of Securities\" in the Statement of Fiduciary Net Position. Short sales expose the short seller to potentially unlimited liability because there is no upward limit on the price a shorted security could attain. Certain portfolio guidelines permit short sales and, to mitigate risks in various ways, such as: limiting the total value of short sales as a percentage of portfolio value, establishing portfolio vs. benchmark tracking error limits, and monitoring other statistical and economic risk measures of the portfolio. Investment performance and risk associated with each portfolio is measured against benchmarks and monitored by management. When a short sale occurs, the shorting portfolio must borrow the security and deliver it to the buyer. If the shorted security is owned by another WRS portfolio, investment policies allow the borrowing of the shorted securities from other WRS portfolios. Except in the case of borrowings within the same trust fund, the WRS is required to post collateral to the lender, at the required rate of 102% for in-currency loans and 105% for cross-currency loans. At December 31, 2021 , the WRS posted $127.2 million in cash and $5.2 billion in securities as collateral to security lenders. This represented $46.1 million in excess of the fair market value of the securities borrowed. If the security lender recalled the security and the WRS was not able to supply the lender with the security, the lender would be permitted to use the WRS's collateral to fund the purchase of the security. 2.State Investment Fund The State Investment Fund (SIF) pools the cash of the State of Wisconsin and its agencies, the WRS, and various local government units (Local Government Investment Pool - LGIP) into a commingled fund with the investment objective of safety of principal and liquidity while earning a competitive money market rate of return. In the State's Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the SIF is not reported as a separate fund; rather, each State fund's share in the \"pool\" is reported on the balance sheet as \"Cash and Cash Equivalents.\" Shares of the SIF belonging to other participating public institutions are presented in the Local Government Pooled Investment Fund, an investment trust fund. Wis. Stat. Secs. 25.17(3)(b), (ba), (bd) and (dg) enumerate the various types of securities in which the SIF can be invested, which include obligations of the United States or its agencies, corporations wholly owned by the United States or chartered by an act of Congress, securities guaranteed by the United States, the unsecured notes of financial and industrial issuers, direct obligations of or guaranteed by the government of Canada, certificates of deposit issued by banks in the United States including solvent financial institutions in Wisconsin and banker's acceptances. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board's (the Board) Board of Trustees may specifically approve other prudent legal investments. For financial statement purposes, the carrying value of securities depends on asset class. Repurchase Agreements and nonnegotiable Certificates of Deposit and Time Deposits are valued at cost because they are non-participating contracts that do not capture interest rate changes in their value. All remaining debt investments (U.S. Government/ Agency securities, Banker's Acceptances, Commercial Paper, Corporate Notes, and negotiable Certificates of Deposit) are carried at fair value. Because quoted market prices for SIF securities are often not available at month end, BNY Mellon, as SWIB's custodial bank, compiles fair values from third party pricing services which use matrix pricing models to estimate a security's fair value. For purposes of calculating earnings to each participant, all investments are valued at amortized cost. Specifically, income is distributed to pool participants monthly, based on their average daily share balance. Distributions include interest income based on stated rates (both paid and accrued), amortization of discounts and premiums on a constant yield basis, realized investment gains and losses calculated on an amortized cost basis, and investment expenses. This method does not distribute to participants any unrealized gains and losses generated by the pool's investments. SIF pool shares are bought and redeemed at $1.00 based on the amortized cost of the investments in the SIF. The State of Wisconsin does not provide any legally binding guarantees to support the value of pool shares. Fair Value Reporting The SIF categorizes its fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy established by generally accepted accounting principles. The hierarchy is based on the valuation inputs used to measure the fair value of the asset. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets, Level 2 inputs are significant other observable inputs, and Level 3 inputs are significant unobservable inputs. Investments held at cost or amortized cost are not reported within the fair value hierarchy. The following table presents the recurring fair value measurements as of June 30, 2022 (in millions): Fair Value Measurement Using Fair ValueLevel 1 InputsLevel 2 InputsLevel 3 Inputs Investments by Fair Value Level: Government & Agencies $ 10,607.2 $ 1,314.1 $ 9,293.0 $ \u2014 Commercial Banker's Acceptances 50.0 \u2014 20.0 30.0 Corporate Notes 22.6 \u2014 22.6 \u2014 Total By Fair Value Level $ 11,355.9 $ 1,314.1 $ 9,938.8 $ 103.0 Short-Term Reported at Cost or Amortized Cost: Repurchase Agreements $ 9,023.4 Time Deposits (non- negotiable) 150.0 Total $ 20,529.4 State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 86Debt securities categorized as Level 2 are valued using observable inputs by third party pricing services using a matrix - pricing technique. Matrix pricing is used to value securities based on their relationship to quoted market prices for securities with similar interest rates, maturities, and credit ratings. Most debt securities are classified as Level 2 because they are generally traded using a dealer market, with lower trading volumes than Level 1 securities. Level 3 investments are generally valued using significant inputs that are unobservable to the marketplace. Banker's Acceptances included in Level 3 represent securities that derive their fair value from cost. Typically, due to their short-term nature, cost approximates fair value for these investments. Investments held at cost (Repurchase Agreements and Time Deposits with maturity less than 90 days) are not reported within the fair value hierarchy. Custodial Credit Risk The custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the failure of the counterparty to a transaction, the Board will not be able to recover the value of investments or collateral securities that are in the possession of an outside party. Investments are exposed to custodial credit risk if the securities are uninsured and unregistered and are either held by the counterparty or by the counterparty's trust department or agent but not in the name of the Board. The SIF held repurchase agreements totaling $9.0 billion as of June 30, 2022 . Four of the repurchase agreements are bilateral agreements totaling $1.7 billion and the underlying securities (collateral) for these were held at SWIB's custodian. Nine of the repurchase agreements totaling $2.6 billion, were tri-party agreements. The underlying securities (collateral) for these repurchase agreements were held by the tri-party's agent, not in SWIB's name. The remaining repurchase agreements, totaling $4.7 billion, were related-party, bilateral agreements with the WRS. The underlying securities for these repurchase agreements were held by SWIB's custodian, in SWIB's name. The related party repurchase transactions with the WRS were overnight agreements collateralized with U.S. Treasury securities. The WRS is also a participant in the SIF, with investments totaling $1.4 billion (Core Fund) and $377.8 million (Variable Fund) at June 30, 2022 . The SIF's custodial credit risk policy addresses the primary risks associated with safekeeping and custody. It requires that custodial institutions be selected through a competitive bid process and that the institution be designated a \"Systemically Important Financial Institution\" by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The policy also requires that the SIF be reflected as beneficial owner on all securities entrusted to the custodian and that the SIF has access to safekeeping and custody accounts. The custodian is also required to be insured for errors and omissions and must provide the SIF with an annual report on internal controls. The SIF's current custodial bank was selected in accordance with these guidelines and meets all requirements stipulated in the custodial credit risk policy. Concentration of Credit Risk Concentration of credit risk is the risk of loss attributed to the magnitude of an organization's investment in a single issuer. The SIF's investment guidelines limit concentrations of credit risk by establishing maximum issuer and/or issue exposure limits based on credit rating. These guidelines do not place a limit on maximum exposure for any U.S. Treasury or Agency discount notes. As of June 30, 2022 , the SIF has more than five percent of its investments in FHLB (38.7 percent), U.S. Treasury (9.1 percent) and Repurchase Agreement collateral (44.0 percent) consisting of various securities issued by the U.S. Government and its agencies. Since the Repurchase Agreements generally mature each day, new collateral, consisting of a different blend of U.S. Government and agency securities, is assigned each day. Credit Quality Risk Credit risk is the risk that an issuer or other counterparty to an investment will not fulfill its obligations. The Board established investment guidelines with maximum exposure limits by security type based on the minimum credit ratings as issued by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs). The following table presents these credit ratings and aggregate exposures by investment type as of June 30, 2022 (in millions): Investment Type RatingsFair Value Repurchase Agreements (Collateral): U.S. Government & Agencies Debt AA $ 9,023.4 Government Sponsored Entity U.S. Agency: Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) A-1+ 7,899.4 Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) AA 41.1 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) A-1+ 306.9 Federal Farm Credit Bank (FFCB) A-1+ Credit Bank (FFCB) Treasury: Short-Term (Bills and Notes) Long-Term (Notes) AA 134.1 Commercial Paper A-1+ A-1+ 150.0 Banker's Acceptances A-1+ 50.0 Corporate Notes AAA 1.5 Corporate Notes AA 21.1 Total Investments $ 20,529.4 Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. The Weighted Average Maturity (WAM) method is used to analyze interest rate risk. Investment guidelines mandate that the WAM for the entire portfolio will not exceed one year.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 87At June 30, 2022 , the following table shows the investments by investment type, amount and the weighted average maturities (in millions): Investment Type Fair ValueWeighted Average Maturity (Days) Government & Agencies 10,607.2 42 Repurchase Agreements $ 9,023.4 1 Commercial Paper 676.2 16 Time Deposits 150.0 1 Banker's Acceptances 50.0 33 Corporate Notes 22.6 55 Total Investments $ 20,529.4 Portfolio Weighted Average Maturity (Days) 23 Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely impact the fair value of an investment.

ENDOWMENTS Primary Government University of Wisconsin System The University of Wisconsin System invested its trust funds, principally gifts and bequests designated as endowments or quasi- endowments, in two of its own investment pools: the Long Term Fund and the Applied Security Analysis Program \"RegentFund.\" In Fiscal Year 2018, the Board of Regents transferred its investment management responsibilities of the Long Term Fund to the State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) as permitted through Section 36.11 (11m) of the Wisconsin statutes. The RegentFund was established on April 1, 2019, as an investment fund for a limited number of participating Trust Funds accounts. The RegentFund is an intermediate-term fixed income portfolio, governed by and subject to a Board- approved Memorandum of Understanding, which includes detailed investment guidelines. Benefiting University of Wisconsin System entities receive quarterly distributions from the Long Term Fund, principally endowed assets, based on an annual spending rate applied to a 12-quarter moving average market value of the fund. The annual spending rate is currently 4.0 percent. Distributions from the RegentFund, principally quasi-endowments and unspent income distributions, consist of interest earnings distributed quarterly. Spending rate and interest distributions from both of these funds are transferred to the State Investment Fund, pending near-term expenditures. At June 30, 2022 , net appreciation of the endowment accounts was $166.0 million which was available to meet spending rate distributions, of which $20.6 million was actually authorized for expenditure. For University of Wisconsin System-controlled, donor-restricted endowments, the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act as adopted, permits the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System to appropriate for current spending, an amount of realized and unrealized endowment appreciation as they determine to be prudent. Realized and unrealized appreciation in excess of that amount appropriated for current spending is retained by the endowments. University of Wisconsin System investment policies and guidelines are governed and authorized by the Board of Regents. The approved asset allocation for the new SWIB-managed Long Term Fund has a target to public markets of the following: 57.0 percent public equities, 20.0 percent fixed income, and 23.0 percent inflation sensitive securities. Private markets are not included in the target asset allocation. The legacy private markets investments will self-liquidate as distributions are made from existing funds with no new commitments intended. The fair value of Endowments as of June 30, 2022 was $530.2 million including an unrealized loss of $62.6 million when fair values as of June 30, 2022 are compared to asset acquisition costs. The calculation of realized gains and losses is independent of a calculation of the net change in the fair value of investments since realized gains and losses are based on the difference between the selling price and the acquisition cost of the asset. Therefore, when assets are reported at fair value much of the realized gain or loss may have already been included in prior years as part of the overall change in the fair value of investments.At June 30, 2022 , the book value and fair value of principal funds under control of the University of Wisconsin System was (in millions): Original Contributions and Distributed Net Gains $ 347.3 Realized Gains - Undistributed 245.5 Book Value 592.8 Unrealized Net Gains/Losses - Undistributed Fair Value $ 530.2 On June 30, 2022 , the portfolio at market, for the Long Term Fund, contained 38.9 percent in global equities, 17.0 percent in Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS), 16.8 percent in investment grade government/credit, 5.2 percent in hedged non-U.S. equities, 2.7 percent in real estate investment trusts, 2.4 percent in emerging markets equities, and 17.0 percent in private markets. The total return (loss) on the principal Long Term Fund including capital appreciation was (7.6) percent for the year. On June 30, 2022 , the portfolio at market, for the RegentFund, contained 93.2 percent in fixed income securities and 6.8 percent in cash and cash equivalents. The total return on the principal RegentFund including capital appreciation was (10.7) percent for the year.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 93NOTE 9.

To date, the Commission has authorized and issued genera l obligation bonds and notes primarily to provide funds for the acquisition or improvement of land, water, property, highways, buildings, equipment or facilities for public purposes. Occasionally, general obligation bonds are also issued for the purpose of providing funds for veterans housing loans and to refund general obligation bonds. All general obligation bonds and notes authorized and issued by the State are secured by a pledge of the full faith, credit and taxing power of the State of Wisconsin and are customarily repaid over a period of twenty to thirty years. Article VIII of the Wisconsin Constitution and Wis. Stat. Section 18.05 set limits on the amount of debt that the State can contract in total and in any calendar year. In total, debt outstanding cannot exceed five percent of the value of all taxable property in the State. Annual debt issued cannot exceed the lesser of three- quarters of one percent or five percent of the value of all taxable property in the State less net indebtedness at January 1.

C.Annual Appropriation Bonds 2003 Annual Appropriation Bonds In December 2003, the State issued $1.8 billion of General Fund Annual Appropriation Bonds consisting of Series A (Taxable Fixed Rate) and Series B (Taxable Auction Rate Certificates). These appropriation obligations were authorized by Wisconsin Statutes to obtain proceeds to pay the State's anticipated unfunded accrued prior service (pension) liability under Wis. Stat. Section 40.05(2)(b) and its unfunded accrued liability for sick leave conversion credits under Wis. Stat. Section 40.05(4)(b), (bc), and (bw) and Subchapter IX of Chapter 40. In April and June 2008, the State issued $1.0 billion of General Fund Annual Appropriation Refunding Bonds to refund the Series B (Taxable Auction Rate Certificates) that were issued in 2003. The 2008 issuance consisted of Series A (Taxable Fixed Rate) and Series B and C (Taxable Floating Rate Notes). In November 2012, the State issued $251.6 million bonds to refund a portion of the 2003 Series A bonds. In August 2016, the State issued $400.1 million of General Fund Annual Appropriation Refunding Bonds (Taxable) to refund the May 2018 maturities of the 2008 Series A Bonds. In February 2020, the State issued $623.3 million of General Fund Annual Appropriation Refunding Bonds (Taxable) to refund the 2008 Series B bonds and 2008 Series C bonds, and make termination payments on the interest rate exchange agreements, or swap agreements relating to the 2008 Series B bonds and 2008 Series C bonds. In March 2021, the State issued $118.7 million of General Fund Annual Appropriation Refunding Bonds (Taxable) to refund the 2012 Series A. These appropriation obligations are not general obligations of the State, and do not constitute \"public debt\" of the State as that term is used in the Constitution and in the State Statutes. The payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the obligations is subject to annual appropriation; that is, payments due in any fiscal year of the State will be made only to the extent sufficient amounts are appropriated by the Legislature. The State is not legally obligated to appropriate any amounts for payment of debt service. The Legislature, recognizing its moral obligation to make timely appropriations from the General Fund sufficient to pay debt service on such obligations, expresses in Wis. Stat. Section 16.527(10) its expectation and aspiration that it will do so. The Legislature's recognition of a moral obligation, however, does not create a legally enforceable obligation. The General Fund Annual Appropriation Bonds of 2003, Series A (Taxable Fixed Rate) in the outstanding principal amount of $349.6 million (\"2003 Series A Bonds\"), bear interest at a rate of 5.70 percent computed on the basis of a 30-day month and a 360- day year, payable semiannually on each May 1 and November 1 until their maturity dates. The General Fund Annual Appropriation Refunding Bonds of 2016, Series A (Taxable) in the outstanding principal amount of $206.3 million (2016 Series A Bonds), bear interest at rates from 2.05 percent to 2.48 percent computed on the basis of a 30-day month and a 360-day year and for the number of days actually elapsed, payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 until their maturity dates.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 102The General Fund Annual Appropriation Refunding Bonds of 2020, Series A (Taxable) in the outstanding principal amount of $570.4 million (2020 Series A Bonds), bear interest at rates from 1.75 percent to 2.50 percent computed on the basis of a 30-day month and a 360-day year and for the number of days actually elapsed, payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 until their maturity dates. The General Fund Annual Appropriation Refunding Bonds of 2021, Series A (Taxable) in the outstanding principal amount of $118.0 million (2021 Series A Bonds), bear interest at rates from 0.31 percent to 1.64 percent computed on the basis of a 30-day month and a 360-day year and for the number of days actually elapsed, payable semiannually on May 1 and November 1 until their maturity dates.

Stat. Section 16.63. In August 2016, January 2017, May 2017, and January 2019, the State issued an aggregate $1.5 billion of General Fund Annual Appropriation Refunding Bonds (Taxable and Tax Exempt) to refund a portion of the appropriation obligations issued in 2009. The 2016 Series B (Taxable) General Fund Annual Appropriation Bonds in the outstanding principal amount of $192.5 million bear interest rates from 2.05 percent to 3.29 percent computed on the basis of a 30-day month and a 360-day year, payable semiannually on each May 1 and November 1, until their maturity dates. The 2017 Series A (Taxable) General Fund Annual Appropriation Bonds in the outstanding principal amount of $416.9 million bear interest rates from 2.68 percent to 3.95 percent computed on the basis of a 30-day month and a 360-day year, payable semiannually on each May 1 and November 1, until their maturity dates. The 2017 Series B General Fund Annual Appropriation Bonds in the outstanding principal amount of $101.9 million bear interest rates from 4.00 percent to 5.00 percent computed on the basis of a 30- day month and a 360-day year, payable semiannually on each May 1 and November 1, until their maturity dates.

These appropriation obligations are not general obligations of the State, and do not constitute \"public debt\" of the State as that term is used in the Constitution and in the State Statutes. The payment of the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the obligations is subject to annual appropriation; that is, payments due in any fiscal year of the State will be made only to the extent sufficient amounts are appropriated by the Legislature. The State is not legally obligated to appropriate any amounts for payment of debt service. The Legislature, recognizing its moral obligation to make timely appropriations from the General Fund sufficient to pay debt service on such obligations, expresses in Wis. Stat. Section 16.527(10) its expectation and aspiration that it will do so. The Legislature's recognition of a moral obligation, however, does not create a legally enforceable obligation.

Chapter 18, Subchapter II of the Wisconsin Statutes as amended, Wis. Stat. Sec. 84.59 and a general bond resolution and series resolutions authorize the issuance of these bonds. The Department of Transportation is authorized to issue a total of $4.3 billion of revenue bonds. Presently, there are twelve issues of Transportation Revenue Bonds outstanding totaling $1.7 billion.

Certificates of Participation The State established a facility in 1992 that provides lease purchase financing for property and certain service items acquired by state agencies. This facility is the Third Amended and Restated Master Lease between the State acting by and through the Department of Administration and U.S. Bank National Association. Lease purchase obligations under the Master Lease are not general obligations of the State but are payable from appropriations of State agencies participating in the Master Lease Program, subject to annual appropriation. The interest component of each lease/ purchase payment is subject to a separate determination. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of this agreement, the trustee for the facility issues parity Master Lease certificates of participation that evidence proportionate interest of the owners thereof in lease payments. A common pool of collateral ratably secures all Master Lease certificates. Title in the property and service items purchased under the facility remains with the State and the State grants to the Trustee, for the benefit of all Master Lease certificate holders, a first security interest in the leased items. The outstanding balance as of June 30, 2022 was as follows: Balance DueAverage Life (Weighted Term) $67.7 Million 3.02 Years At June 30, 2022 , the following parity Master Lease certificates were outstanding (in thousands): IssueIssue DateInterest RatesMaturity Through Issued Outstanding $ 63,727 $ 67,660 *see Revolving Credit AgreementState of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 105As of June 30, 2022 , Master Lease certificate debt service requirements for principal and interest for governmental activities and business-type activities are as follows (in thousands): Fiscal Year Governmental Activities Business-Type Activities Ended June 30 Principal Interest Principal Interest 2023 $ 10,825 $ 2,023 $ 184 7,284 4,988 1,160 Total 57,425 7,284 10,236 1,480 Revolving Credit Agreement Master Lease Certificates of Participation of 2013, Series A (Revolving Credit Agreement - Taxable) in the amount of $8.4 million .

The scheduled termination date under the Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended, is September 1, 202 4. This Master Lease certificate shall bear interest at the rates and mature on the dates provided for in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The balance of this Master Lease certificate may include some accrued interest that will be payable at the next semi- annual interest payment date. The Third Amended and Restated Master Lease 1992-1 provides that certain lease schedules to the facility can be terminated if the State deposits with the Trustee an amount that is equal to the outstanding amount of the lease schedule, or in amounts that are sufficient to purchase investments that mature on dates and in amounts to make the lease payments when due. At June 30, 2022 , the State has not deposited with the Trustee amounts, that when invested, will terminate lease schedules. F. Refundings, Exchanges and Early Extinguishments Refunding Provisions of GASB Statement No. 23 The State implemented the provisions of GASB Statement No. 23. Accounting and Financial Reporting for Refunding of Debt Reported by Proprietary Activities beginning with Fiscal Year 1996. This Statement requires proprietary activities to adopt certain accounting and reporting changes for both current refunding and advance refunding resulting in defeasance of debt. GASB Statement No. 23 permits, but does not require, retroactive application of its provisions. The State has chosen not to apply the provisions retroactively to previously issued financial statements.Current Fiscal Year Refundings/General Obligation Bonds In September 2021, the State issued $326.4 million of general obligation refunding bonds (2021 Series 4), the proceeds of $324.7 million were deposited in an escrow account to provide for future debt service payments and redemption of $285.6 million of various general obligation bonds for which future debt service payments and redemption are paid from the escrow account are considered defeased and the associated liability removed from the financial statements. The refunding resulted in a decrease in total debt service payments by $62.9 million and an economic gain of $50.3 million. In March 2022, the State issued $73.5 million of general obligation refunding bonds (2022 Series 1), of which $32.4 million is allocable to just the refunding and the remaining $41.1 million is allocable to the funding of commercial paper. The proceeds of $34.6 million were deposited in the bond security and redemption fund for the redemption of $34.6 million of various general obligation bonds for which redemption was paid from the bond security and redemption fund are considered defeased and the associated liability removed from the financial statements.

Short-term Financing The State of Wisconsin Building Commission, an agency of the State, is empowered by law to consider, authorize, issue, and sell debt obligations of the State. To date, the Commission has authorized the issuance of notes. When this short-term debt does not meet long-term financing criteria, it is classified among fund liabilities. General Obligation Commercial Paper Notes The State has authorized General Obligation Commercial Paper Notes for the acquisition, construction, development, extension, enlargement, or improvement of land, waters, property, highway, buildings, equipment or facilities. Periodically, additional commercial paper notes are issued to pay for maturing commercial paper notes. The State intends to make annual May 1 payments on the outstanding commercial paper notes that reflect principal amortization of the notes. The State also intends to make regular payments to the issuing and paying agent that will be used to pay interest due on maturing notes. With the issuance on March 1, 2022 of its General Obligation Refunding Bonds (2022 Series 1), the State retired all of the outstanding commercial paper notes, and as of June 30, 2022, no commercial paper notes remain outstanding.Short-term debt activity for the year ended June 30, 2022 for general obligation commercial paper notes was as follows (in millions): Balance Balance July 1, 2021 Additions Reductions June 30, 2022 $ 92.5 \u2014 $ 92.5 $ \u2014 General Obligation Extendible Municipal Commercial Paper The State has authorized General Obligation extendible municipal commercial paper for the acquisition, construction, development, extension, enlargement, or improvement of land, waters, property, highway, buildings, equipment or facilities.

Specifically, the excess of the aggregated amount earned on investments purchased with bond proceeds over the amount that would have been earned if the proceeds were invested at a rate equal to the bond yield, is to be rebated to the federal government. As of June 30, 2022 , a liability for arbitrage rebate did not exist. I.Moral Obligation Debt Through legislation enacted in 1999, the State authorized the creation of local districts. One district, the Wisconsin Center District, is currently authorized to issue bonds for specific purposes, and if the State determines that certain conditions are satisfied, the State may have a moral obligation to appropriate moneys to make up deficiencies in the district's special debt service reserve fund. To date, the Wisconsin Center District has the authority for up to $300.0 million in bonds for this purpose, plus refunding bonds. The Wisconsin Center District has one outstanding series of bonds in the outstanding balance of $300.0 million and two outstanding refunding series with an outstanding balance of $111.8 million that are subject to the moral obligation pledge to appropriate moneys to make up deficiencies in the debt service reserve funds.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 107Through legislation enacted in 1999, the State authorized the issuance of up to $170.0 million principal amount of bonds to finance the development or redevelopment of sites and facilities to be used for public schools. If certain conditions are satisfied, and if a special debt service reserve fund is created for the bonds, the State will provide a moral obligation pledge, which would restore the special debt reserve fund established for the bonds to an amount not to exceed the maximum annual debt service on the bonds. One bond issue with an outstanding balance of $19.0 million has been issued that have a special debt service reserve fund secured by the State's moral obligation. Through legislation enacted in 2017, subject to the Secretary of Administration's designation and determination of certain conditions being met, the State may provide a moral obligation pledge for up to 40% of a local governmental unit's aggregate municipal obligations issued to finance costs related to development occurring in, or for the benefit of, the electronics and information technology manufacturing zone. To date, one series of the Village of Mount Pleasant Tax Increment Revenue Bonds were issued (in 2018) with an outstanding balance of $120.0 million that is subject to the moral obligation. J. Credit Agreements In March 2019, the State entered into a credit agreement that provides the State a line of credit for liquidity support for up to $185.0 million of general obligation commercial paper notes.

State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 108NOTE 12. LEASE COMMITMENTS AND INSTALLMENT PURCHASES The State leases office buildings, space, and equipment under a variety of agreements that vary in lease term, many of which are subject to appropriation from the State Legislature to continue the lease commitment. If such funding, i.e., through legislative appropriation, is judged to be assured, and the likelihood of cancellation through exercise of the fiscal funding clause is remote, leases are considered non-cancelable. Lease payments are generally fixed monthly or annually. The State also leases land, facility space, and equipment to various third parties as the lessor. The University of Wisconsin System recognized revenue related to these leases totaling $5.4 million during FY 2022. The University of Wisconsin System leases certain assets that are subsequently subleased to a third party. The non-cancelable terms of these leasing arrangements mature between 2023 and 2036. The discount rates applicable to these leasing arrangements range from 0.53% to 1.81%. The State does not currently report any sale-leaseback or lease- leaseback transactions under GASB 87 as of June 30, 2022 . The State does not currently report any contracts with residual value guarantees, termination penalties, commitments prior to the commencement of the lease, or impairment under GASB 87 as of June 30, 2022 . A.GASB 87 Leases GASB Statement No. 87, Leases , became effective for the reporting period ending June 30, 2022. With certain exceptions, under GASB 87 all leases are considered finance leases and are reported accordingly. The concept is that leases represent a means to finance the right to use an underlying asset. Lease commitments in the government-wide and proprietary fund statements are reported as liabilities at lease inception.The related assets along with the amortization are also reported at that time as right-to-use assets. Right-to-use assets at inception are recorded at the present value of total lease payments as shown in Note 7. These payments are discounted at the State's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments are reported as a reduction of the liability. For lessor transactions, the State records lease receivables and deferred inflows of resources based on the present value of expected receipts over the lease term. The expected receipts are recorded at the present value of total lease payments using the State's incremental borrowing rate. Primary Government For leases in governmental funds, \"Other Financing Sources - Lease Acquisitions\" and expenditures are recorded at lease inception. Lease payments are recorded as expenditures.The following is an analysis of future principal and interest payment requirements related to the State's lease liability as of June 30, 2022 (in thousands): Governmental Activities Fiscal Year Principal Interest 324,596 36,192 Business- type Activities Fiscal Year Principal Total $ 275,339 $ 47,018 State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 109NOTE 13. POLLUTION REMEDIATION AND ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS Pollution Remediation Obligations Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 49, Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pollution Remediation Obligations , establishes accounting and financial reporting standards for pollution remediation obligations. These are obligations to address the current or potential detrimental effects of existing pollution by participating in pollution remediation activities such as site assessments and cleanups. The scope of the standard excludes pollution prevention or control obligations with respect to current operations, and future pollution remediation obligations that are required upon retirement of an asset, such as landfill closure and post closure care and nuclear power plant decommissioning. Measurement of Obligations GASB Statement No. 49 requires the State to calculate pollution remediation obligations using the expected cash flow technique. These estimates are subject to change over time. Costs may vary due to price fluctuations, changes in technology, changes in potential responsible parties, results of environmental studies, changes to statutes or regulations and other factors. Recoveries from other responsible parties may reduce the State's obligation. In accordance with the standard, if the State cannot reasonably estimate a pollution remediation obligation, it does not report a liability. Under specific circumstances capital assets may be created when pollution remediation is performed. During the fiscal year, the State expended $5.6 million to clean up sites. Estimates of existing pollution remediation liabilities were also increased by $0.4 million. In total, the restated beginning liability of $5.5 million decreased to $0.2 million. There were no recoveries received from other responsible parties during the fiscal year and none are expected for the identified obligations.Identified Remediation Obligations Pollution remediation liabilities are updated annually and are based on engineering studies and the judgment of agency officials. The following table shows liabilities included in the Statement of Net Position as of June 30, 2022 (in millions): Nature and Source of PollutionEstimated LiabilityEstimated Recovery Contract agreement with EPA to clean up Superfund site for former wood treatment facility$ 0.2 $ \u2014 Voluntary commencement by the State to clean up heavy metal contamination of canal near former industrial site \u2014 \u2014 Total estimated obligations $ 0.2 $ \u2014 In addition to the liability reported in the table above, the State expects to incur estimated costs of $10,000 per year indefinitely to pump and treat contamination at a former chrome plating facility. The State also expects to incur estimated costs of $70,000 per year indefinitely to operate and maintain a closed landfill. Both are Superfund sites and estimated total remediation costs for them cannot be reasonably determined. Therefore, a liability has not been reported in the Statement of Net Position for either site. Asset Retirement Obligations GASB Statement No. 83, Certain Asset Retirement Obligations (GASB 83), establishes criteria for determining the timing and pattern of recognition of a liability and a corresponding deferred outflow of resources for asset retirement obligations. In accordance with the statement, the University of Wisconsin System has recognized asset retirement obligations of $13.1 million as of June 30, 2022 , related to decommissioning costs for a nuclear research reactor. This obligation was recognized based on the best estimate of the current value of outlays expected to be incurred. The corresponding deferred outflow of resources is amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the associated tangible capital asset coinciding with a licensure period through the year 2031. The University of Wisconsin System has issued a statement to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission of intent to obtain funds necessary for decommissioning, when necessary. No restricted assets are set aside for payment of the asset retirement obligations.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 110NOTE 14. RETIREMENT PLAN The Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) was established and is administered by the State of Wisconsin to provide pension benefits for State and local government public employees. The WRS consists of the Core Retirement Investment Trust, the Variable Retirement Investment Trust, and the Police and Firefighters Trust. Although separated for accounting purposes, the assets of these trust funds can be used to pay benefits for any member of the WRS, and are reported as one pension plan. The WRS is considered part of the State of Wisconsin's financial reporting entity. Copies of the separately issued financial report that includes audited financial statements and required supplementary information for the year ending December 31, 2021 , is available at www.etf.wi.gov. Plan Description The WRS, governed by Chapter 40 of the Wisconsin Statutes, is a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit pension plan administered by the Department of Employee Trust Funds. Benefit terms may only be modified by the Legislature. It provides coverage to all eligible State of Wisconsin, local government and other public employees. All employees, initially employed by a participating WRS employer prior to July 1, 2011, expected to work at least 600 hours a year (440 hours for teachers and school district educational support employees) and expected to be employed for at least one year from employee's date of hire are eligible to participate in the WRS. All employees, initially employed by a participating WRS employer on or after July 1, 2011, and expected to work at least 1200 hours a year (880 hours for teachers and school district educational support employees) and expected to be employed for at least one year from employee's date of hire are eligible to participate in the WRS. Note: Employees hired to work nine or ten months per year, (e.g. teachers contracts), but expected to return year after year are considered to have met the one-year requirement. As of December 31, 2021 , the number of participating employers was: State Agencies 56 Cities 189 Counties 71 Villages 291 Towns 287 School Districts 421 Wisconsin Technical College System Board Districts 16 Cooperative Educational Service Agencies 12 Other 212 Total Employers 1,555 For employees beginning participation on or after January 1, 1990 and no longer actively employed on or after April 24, 1998, creditable service in each of five years is required for eligibility for a retirement annuity. Participants employed prior to 1990 and on or after April 24, 1998 and prior to July 1, 2011 are immediately vested. Participants who initially became WRS eligible on or after July 1, 2011 must have five years of creditable service to be vested. Employees who retire at or after age 65 (54 for protective occupation employees, 62 for elected officials and State executive participants) are entitled to receive an unreduced retirement benefit. The factors influencing the benefit are: (1) final average earnings, (2) years of creditable service, and (3) a formula factor. Final average earnings is the average of the participant's three highest years' earnings. Creditable service is the creditable current and prior service expressed in years or decimal equivalents of partial years for which a participant receives earnings and makes contributions as required. The formula factor is a standard percentage based on employment category. Vested employees may retire at age 55 (50 for protective occupation employees) and receive reduced benefits. Employees terminating covered employment before becoming eligible for a retirement benefit may withdraw their contributions and forfeit all rights to any subsequent benefits, or may leave contributions on deposit and defer application until eligible to receive a retirement benefit. The WRS also provides death and disability benefits for employees. The Employee Trust Funds Board may periodically adjust annuity payments from the WRS based on annual investment performance in accordance with s. 40.27, Wis. Stat. An increase (or decrease) in annuity payment may result when investment gains (losses), together with other actuarial experience factors, create a surplus (shortfall) in the reserves, as determined by the WRS' consulting actuary. Annuity increases are not based on cost of living or other similar factors. For Core Retirement Investment Trust annuities, decreases may be applied only to previously granted increases. By law, Core Retirement Investment Trust fund annuities cannot be reduced to an amount below the original, guaranteed amount set at retirement. Accounting Policies and Plan Asset Matters The financial statements of the WRS have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, using the flow of economic resources measurement focus and a full accrual basis of accounting. Under the accrual basis of accounting, revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded at the time the liabilities are incurred. Plan member contributions are recognized in the period in which contributions are paid. Employer contributions to the plan are recognized in the accounting period in which the underlying earnings on which the contributions are based are paid and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the terms of the plan. All assets of the WRS are invested by the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. The retirement fund assets consist of shares in the Variable Retirement Investment Trust and the Core Retirement Investment Trust. The Variable Retirement Investment Trust consists primarily of equity securities. The Core Retirement Investment Trust is a balanced investment fund made up of fixed income securities and equity securities. Shares in the Core Retirement Investment Trust are purchased as funds are made available from retirement contributions and investment income, and sold when funds for benefit payments and other expenses are needed. The assets of the Core and Variable Retirement Investment Trusts are carried at fair value with all market value adjustments recognized in current operations. Investments are revalued monthly to current market value. The resulting valuation gains or losses are recognized as income, although revenue has not been realized through a market-place transaction.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 111The WRS does not have any investments (other than those issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government) in any one organization that represent 5.0 percent or more of plan net position. Contributions Required Required contributions are determined by an annual actuarial valuation in accordance with Chapter 40 of the Wisconsin Statutes. The employee required contribution is one-half of the actuarially determined contribution rate for general category employees, including teachers, and executives and elected officials. In 2016, executives & elected officials' contributions rates were changed to match General. Required contributions for protective contributions are the same rate as general employees. Employers are required to contribute the remainder of the actuarially determined contribution rate. The employer may not pay the employee required contribution unless provided for by an existing collective bargaining agreement. Contribution rates as of June 30, 2022 are: Employee Employer General (including teachers) 6.50% 6.50% Executives & Elected Officials 6.50% 6.50% Protective with Social Security 6.50% 12.00% Protective without Social Security 6.50% 16.40% Employers are required to contribute an actuarially determined amount necessary to fund the remaining projected cost of future benefits. State of Wisconsin Net Pension Asset, Pension Contributions, Pension Revenue, and Deferred Outflows and Inflows of Resources At June 30, 2022 the State reported a net pension asset of $2.30 billion for its proportionate share of the WRS' net pension asset. It is presented as a net pension asset on the Statement of Net Position for proprietary funds and on the government-wide Statement of Net Position. The net pension asset was measured as of December 31, 2021 , and the total pension liability was based on an actuarial valuation as of December 31, 2020 . Update procedures were used to roll forward the total pension liability to the measurement date. No material changes in assumptions or benefit terms occurred between the actuarial valuation date and the measurement date. The State's proportionate share of the net pension asset was determined based on the State's share of contributions to the WRS relative to the contributions of all participating employers. At December 31, 2021 , the State's proportionate share was 28.5 percent, which is an increase of 0.4 percent from its proportionate share as of December 31, 2020 . For calendar year 2021 , State employers made $333.9 million in contributions recognized by the WRS. For the year ended June 30, 2022 , the State recognized pension revenue of $196.5 million. At June 30, 2022 , the State reported deferred outflows and inflows of resources related to pensions of $4.30 billion and $5.40 billion, respectively. Deferred outflows and inflows related to pensions, including the types and the amounts applicable to each type, can be found in table below (in thousands): Deferred Outflows of ResourcesDeferred Inflows of Resources Differences Between Expected and Actual Pension Experience $ 3,705,525 $ (267,208) Changes of Pension Assumptions 427,946 \u2014 Net Difference Between Projected and Actual Earnings on Pension Investments \u2014 (5,131,432) Changes in Proportionate Share 7,192 (4,609) Pension Contributions Subsequent to the Measurement Date 162,200 \u2014 Total $ 4,302,863 $ (5,403,249) The $162.2 million in deferred outflows of resources resulting from contributions subsequent to the measurement date will be recognized as a decrease to the net pension liability or an increase to the net pension asset in the year ended June 30, 2023 .

Actual adjustments are based on recognized investment return, actuarial experience, and other factors. The assumed annual adjustment is 1.7%, based on the investment return assumption and the post-retirement discount rate. This includes the impact of known Market Recognition Account deferred gains/losses on the liability for dividend payments. Actuarial assumptions are based upon an experience study conducted in 2021 using experience from 2018-2020. The total pension liability for December 31, 2021 is based upon a roll- forward of the liability calculated from the December 31, 2020 actuarial valuation. Long-Term Expected Return on Plan Assets The long-term expected rate of return on WRS investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return, net of WRS investment expense and inflation, are developed for each major asset class. The ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. The long-term expected rate of return is reviewed every three years in conjunction with the WRS experience study. For each major asset class that is included in the Core Retirement Investment Trust fund's target asset allocation as of December 31, 2021 , these best estimates of geometric long- term real rates of return were used: Asset Class Target Allocation Rate of Return Global Equities 52.0% 4.2% Fixed Income 25.0 1.8 Inflation Sensitive 19.0 0.2 Real Estate 7.0 3.0 Private Equity/Debt 12.0 7.0 For each major asset class that is included in the Variable Retirement Investment Trust fund's target asset allocation as of December 31, 2021 , these best estimates of geometric long-term real rates of return were used: Asset Class Target Allocation Rate of Return Domestic Equity 70.0% 3.7% International Equity 30.0 4.6 The money-weighted rates of return on pension plan investment for the Core and Variable funds for the calendar year ended 2021 were 17.03% and 19.98%, respectively. The money-weighted rate of return expresses investment performance, net of pension plan expenses, adjusted for the changing amount actually invested. Discount Rate A single discount rate of 6.8% was used to measure the total pension liability, as opposed to a discount rate of 7.0% for the prior year. The discount rate is based on the expected rate of return on pension plan investments. Because of the unique structure of the WRS, the 6.8% expected rate of return implies that a dividend of approximately 1.7% will always be paid. For purposes of the single discount rate, it was assumed that the dividend would always be paid. The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that plan member contributions will be made at the current contribution rate and that employer contributions will be made at rates equal to the difference between actuarially determined contribution rates and the member rate. Based on these assumptions, the pension plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments (including expected dividends) of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. The following presents the State's proportionate share of the net pension liability (asset), calculated using a single discount rate of 6.8%, as well as what the State's net pension liability (asset) would be if it were calculated using a single discount rate that is 1% lower or 1% higher: State's share of the net pension liability (asset) 1% Decrease (5.8%) $ 1,627,617,268 Current Rate (6.8%) $ (2,293,804,977) 1% Increase (7.8%) $ (5,116,499,336) State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 113NOTE 15.

Membership as of December 31, 2021 , * Active membership includes disabled Supplemental Health Insurance Conversion Credit (SHICC) Program The SHICC program includes the State, the University of Wisconsin, and other component units of the State and is considered a single-employer defined benefit OPEB plan. The Department of Employee Trust Funds (ETF) and the ETF Board have the authority for program administration and oversight. The SHICC program is reported as an Other Post-Employment Benefit Trust Fund. The SHICC program was established by Wisconsin Statute 40.95 and is defined in the state compensation plan (Wis. Stat. 230.12(9)). The SHICC program allows members with more than 15 years of eligible service to convert unused sick leave balances into credits to pay for post-retirement health insurance premiums. The SHICC benefit provides a limited match of the members credits earned through the Accumulated Sick Leave Conversion Credit (ASLCC) program. ASLCC program credits are computed at the time of retirement, layoff, or death by multiplying the number of hours of unused sick leave by the highest hourly pay rate at which the employee accrued sick leave that is eligible for conversion. Employment category and number of years of service are also factored into the calculation. The SHICC program also includes a provision for the restoration of 500 hours of credits upon retirement, layoff or death provided at least 500 hours or accrued sick leave were used for a single injury or illness during the three years immediately preceding the retirement, layoff or death while in state service. All ASLCC program credits must be used before the SHICC program credits. Unused ASLCC and SHICC credits have no cash value, are carried forward from year to year without interest, State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 116and when total health insurance premiums paid on behalf of the retired employee equal or exceed the conversion credits, no further payments are made under the ASLCC and SHICC programs. ASLCC and SHICC credits may be escrowed indefinitely after retirement for participants who provide evidence of comparable health insurance coverage from another source. Eligibility and Membership Generally to be eligible to use SHICC credits to pay post- retirement health insurance premiums, members with 15 years of adjusted continuous service (or their insured surviving spouse and/or dependents) must be covered under the State of Wisconsin Group Health Insurance Program. If a member with 20 years of service leaves eligible service prior to retirement, the benefit is vested. Membership as of December 31, 2021 , included: Employment Status Count Retirees and Beneficiaries 21,715 Inactive, Non-retired Members 366 Active Members 72,701 Total 94,782 At retirement, the member must have State of Wisconsin Group Health Insurance Program coverage and satisfy the following: Retire on an immediate annuity; or Retire and receive a lump-sum benefit; or Qualify for a Wisconsin Retirement System (WRS) disability retirement benefit, long-term disability benefit or a protective occupation duty disability benefit under Wisconsin Statute 40.65; or Have 20 years of WRS creditable service and are eligible for an immediate retirement benefit, but have chosen not to apply for retirement or disability benefit immediately Eligible members may elect to escrow their SHICC credits (to be used at a later date) if they have comparable health insurance coverage through another source. If SHICC eligible members are not immediately eligible for an annuity, they must satisfy the following to defer vested (preserved) SHICC credits to pay health premiums when becoming a WRS annuitant: Terminate with 20 years of WRS creditable service (providing they do not elect a WRS separation benefit) or State constitutional officer, a member or an officer of the legislature of the head of a state department or agency who was appointed by the governor with senate confirmation and are not eligible for an immediate annuity when terminating from state employment (providing they do not elect a WRS separation benefit). If not eligible for an immediate annuity and the member is permanently laid off from State employment, the member must have at least 15 years of adjusted continuous service to use SHICC credits to pay health premiums for up to five years after the layoff begins.Contributions and Benefits The ETF Board approves contribution rates annually, based on recommendations from the actuary. Recommended rates are based on an annual valuation, taking into consideration an estimate of the present value of future benefits and the present value of future contributions, in accordance with Wis. Stat. \u00a7 40.05 (4) (by). Employer contributions made during a member's working lifetime funds a post-retirement benefit. Employers made contributions totaling $15.7 million based upon a percentage of active member earnings for the year ending December 31, 2021 . The SHICC program provides matching sick leave hours, that are in addition to, but generally not to exceed the unused sick leave balances that are used to calculate benefits provided under the ASLCC program, to participants retiring (or terminating employment) with 15 or more years of eligible service, as follows: Employment Category Benefit Eligible Hours* ProtectiveMatch up to 78 hours (9.75 days) per full year of service through 24 years, plus 104 hours (13 days) per full year of service over 24 years. OthersMatch up to 52 hours (6.5 days) per full year of service through 24 years, plus up to 104 hours (13 days) per full year of service over 24 years. *The SHICC program also includes a restoration benefit of up to 500 hours when certain criteria are met. The SHICC program also provides benefits after a member's death. The member's surviving spouse and/or dependents may be eligible to use SHICC credits to pay State of Wisconsin Group Health Insurance premiums under the following conditions: Member was covered by the State of Wisconsin Group Health Insurance Program under a family policy on the member's date of death or the member is receiving a retirement disability benefit; or Member has preserved SHICC credits and the member dies before becoming a WRS annuitant; or Member has escrowed SHICC credits and the member dies.

OTHER POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS A.State Retiree Health Insurance OPEB The State Retiree Health Insurance program provides postemployment health insurance coverage to all eligible retired employees of the State, the University of Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority, Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority and Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation. The employers do not directly pay any portion of the premium for participating retirees. However, because retirees pay the same premium rate set for active employees, an implicit rate subsidy exists for employers. This implicit rate subsidy is reported as an OPEB liability. At age 65, when eligible, retirees are required to enroll in Medicare. No assets have accumulated because there is no trust. Retiree Health Insurance Plan Description GASB standards classify the State Retiree Health Insurance program as a single employer defined benefit OPEB plan with multiple participating employers. Medical, prescription drug and dental benefits are provided to eligible retirees. Retirees pay the full premium until age 65 directly to the plan either through \"out-of-pocket\" or from unused accumulated sick leave conversion credits or supplemental health insurance conversion credits. The value of the sick leave benefit is defined as compensated absences and reported under the provisions of GASB Statement No. 16, Accounting for Compensated Absences. Contribution requirements are established and may be amended by the GIB. Premiums for non-Medicare retirees are based on an effective rate structure for the health care service provider selected. Monthly rates range from $618 to $1,470 for single coverage and $1,509 to $3,641 for family coverage. As of January 1, 2021 (most recent actuarial valuation date), membership consisted of: Member Type Number Retired members or beneficiaries receiving OPEB benefits 8,219 Vested terminated members not yet receiving OPEB benefits 1,214 Active members 62,805 Total Members 72,238 Inclusion of OPEB Information for Component Units GASB standards require the presentation of OPEB related amounts and information in the State's financial statements for both the State of Wisconsin (the primary government) and the component units. The component units are responsible for their share of the OPEB liabilities. Reported amounts related to the OPEB liability, OPEB expense/(revenue) and related deferred inflows and outflows for the OPEB plans may vary by an immaterial amount from the final amounts due to the timing of available information. Total Retiree Health OPEB Liability The actuarial valuation was based on the plan of retiree benefits and was made for purposes of fulfilling GASB accounting standards which require recognition of the employer cost of postemployment benefits over an employee's career. The total cost of providing postemployment benefits is projected, considering relevant assumptions, then discounted to determine the total OPEB liability. To determine the total OPEB liability for the program, the actuary performed an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2020 and adjusted for changes such as interest earned, contributions paid, and benefits paid through June 30, 2021 . Based on this, the actuary determined the OPEB liability totaled $712.9 million. The total OPEB liability was allocated to participating employers based on their proportionate share of health insurance premiums contributed for active employees. Amounts by participating employers as of a June 30, 2022 reporting date, are indicated in the table below (in millions): Participating EmployerOPEB Liability Primary Government State of Wisconsin $ 316.5 University of Wisconsin System 316.7 Component Units UW Hospital and Clinics Auth. 77.4 WI Housing & Economic Development Auth. 1.4 WI Economic Development Corp. 0.9 Total OPEB Liability $ 712.9 Changes in the Total OPEB Liability Changes to the total OPEB plan liability during the fiscal year include the following (in millions): Total OPEB Liability June 30, 2020 $ 642.0 Changes for the Year: Service cost 52.5 Interest 14.9 Difference between expected & actual experience 92.1 Changes of assumptions (41.2) Benefit payments* (47.4) Net Change in Total OPEB Liability 70.9 Total OPEB Liability June 30, 2021 $ 712.9 * Employer benefit payments of $47.4 million were actuarially determined and pertain to the implicit rate subsidy.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 118Actuarial Methods and Assumptions Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan (the plan as understood by the employer and plan members) and include the types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the employer and plan members to that point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the long- term perspective of the calculations. The total OPEB liability in the January 1, 2021 actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial assumptions and other inputs, applied to all periods included in the measurement unless otherwise specified: Actuarial Valuation Date January 1, 2021 Measurement Date of Total OPEB Liability June 30, 2021 Actuarial cost method Entry Age Normal Asset Valuation Method N/A Inflation 2.4% Salary increases Separate merit and longevity increase rates by employer and service, plus 3% Discount Rate Discount rate was changed to 2.16% for the June 30, 2021 measurement from 2.21% for the June 30, 2020 measurement Healthcare Cost Trend Rates: Medical 4.10% for the first year then 6.75% grading down 0.25% per year to 4.50% Prescription drug 10.67% for the first year then 7.50% grading down 0.25% per year to 4.50% Dental 0.00% for first two years then 3.00% thereafter Administrative Costs (4.03) % for first year then 3.00% every year after Mortality Rates Wisconsin 2020 Mortality Table Benefit Changes None Participation Rates Active: 60% are assumed to elect coverage at retirement, and 12.5% of the 40% that defer are assumed to be covered over the next 5 years (1.0% per year), so 65% assumed to be covered after 5 years Deferred: 5% per year over 8 years Assumed Claims Per capita claims costs were based on premium equivalent rates for plan year 2021 and actuarial factors applied to weighted average premium rates to estimate costsTermination Rates Rates for General, University, Protective, Executive and Elected employees matched the 2018-2020 experience study for the pension valuation Disability Rates Rates for General, University, Protective, Executive and Elected employees matched the 2018-2020 experience study for the pension valuation Normal Retirement RatesRates for General, University, Protective, Executive and Elected employees matched the 2018-2020 experience study for the pension valuation Lapse Rate 5% per year after the later of assumed commencement or the valuation date Retiree Contribution Increase RateRetiree contributions are expected to increase with average benefit trend Benefit End Date Benefits end when participants turn 65 years old Actuarial assumptions are based on the Wisconsin Retirement System experience study conducted in 2021 using experience from 2018 to 2020. An actuarial experience loss increased the liability by $92.1 million due to demographic changes and actual 2021 contributions and benefit payments that were different form expected. Valuation assumption changes also decreased the liability by $41.2 million as the result of a decrease in obligations due to changes in the participation rate assumptions and the valuation-year per capita health costs based on recent experience, which was offset by an increase in obligations due to updating the healthcare trend rates, adopting updated demographic assumptions based on the WRS Experience Study for the period 2018 - 2020 and lowering the discount rate.

Each employer's proportionate share of the net OPEB liability and collective OPEB expense, deferred inflows and outflows is based on the employer's contributions for the most recent calendar year compared to the total contributions of all employers. Inclusion of OPEB Information for Component Units GASB standards require the presentation of OPEB related amounts and information in the State's financial statements for both the State of Wisconsin (the primary government) and the component units. The component units are responsible for their share of the OPEB liabilities. Reported amounts related to the OPEB liability, OPEB expense and related deferred inflows and outflows for the OPEB plans may vary by an immaterial amount from the final amounts due to the timing of available information. OPEB Liabilities, OPEB Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to OPEB At June 30, 2022 , the State, including the University of Wisconsin System, reported a liability of $841.6 million for its proportionate share of the net OPEB liability. The net OPEB liability was measured as of December 31, 2021 and the total OPEB liability used to calculate the net OPEB liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as January 1, 2021 rolled forward to December 31, 2021 . The State's proportion of the net OPEB liability was based on the State's share of contributions to the OPEB plan relative to the contributions of all participating employers. At December 31, 2021 , the State's proportion was 88.8 percent which was an increase of 0.7 percent from its proportion of 88.1 percent measured as of December 31, 2020 .

The change in the discount rate was primarily caused by the decrease in the municipal bond rate from 2.12% as of December 31, 2020 to 2.06% as of December 31, 2021. The Plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be insufficient to make all projected future benefit payments of current active and inactive employees. Therefore, the discount rate for calculating the Total OPEB Liability is equal to the single equivalent rate that results in the same actuarial present value as the long-term expected rate of return applied to benefit payments, to the extent that the plan's fiduciary net position is projected to be sufficient to make projected benefit payments, and the municipal bond rate applied to benefit payments to the extent that the plan's fiduciary net position is projected to be insufficient. The source of the municipal bond rate used is the Bond Buyers GO Index. The plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make projected future benefit payments of current plan members through December 31, 2033. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on plan investments was applied through 2033 and the municipal bond index rate was applied for all remaining periods of projected benefit payments to determine the Total OPEB Liability. Long-term expected Return on Plan Assets The long-term expected rate of return is determined by adding expected inflation to expected long-term real returns and reflecting expected volatility and correlation. Investments for the retiree life insurance plans are held with Securian, the insurance carrier. Interest is calculated and credited to the plans based on the rate of return for a segment of the insurance carriers' general fund, specifically 10-year A- Bonds (as a proxy, and not tied to any specific investments). The overall aggregate interest rate is calculated using a tiered approach based on the year the funds were originally invested and the rate of return for that year. Investment interest is credited based on the aggregate rate of return and assets are not adjusted to fair market value. Furthermore, the insurance carrier guarantees the principal amounts of the reserves, including all interest previously credited thereto.

The projections of cash flows used to determine the single discount rate assumed that employer contributions will be made according to the current employer contributions schedule and that contributions are made by plan members retiring prior to age 65. The total OPEB liability in the January 1, 2021, actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement: Actuarial Valuation Date: January 1, 2021 Measurement Date of Net OPEB Liability: December 31, 2021 Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Experience Study:January 1, 2018 - December 31, 2020, Published November 19, 2021 20 Year Tax-Exempt Municipal Bond Yield: 2.06% Long-Term Expected C.Supplemental Health Insurance Conversion Credit OPEB The Supplemental Health Insurance Conversion Credit plan provides all eligible employees of the State, the University of Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Authority and Wisconsin Housing and Economic Development Authority with credits that can be used to pay for post-retirement health insurance.

This single discount rate was based on the expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments of 6.8%. The projection of cash flows used to determine this single discount rate assumed that employer contributions will be made at rates equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate. Based on these assumptions, the OPEB plan's fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the Total OPEB Liability and projections were excluded from this report. Long-term expected Return on Plan Assets The assets of the SHICC are commingled with assets from other benefit programs and invested in the Core Retirement Investment Trust (Core Fund). Earnings are allocated between the benefit programs based on the average balance invested for each program. The State of Wisconsin Investment Board (SWIB) manages the Core Fund with oversight by the SWIB Board of Trustees, as authorized in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 25.17. The long-term expected rate of return is reviewed every three years in conjunction with the Wisconsin Retirement System experience study. Best estimates of geometric real rates of return of each major asset class included in the OPEB plan's target allocation as of December 31, 2021, are summarized in the following table: Asset ClassTarget AllocationLong-Term Expected Geometric Real Rate of Return Global Equities 52.0 % 4.2 % Fixed Income 25.0 % 1.8 % Inflation Sensitive Assets 19.0 % 0.2 % Real Estate 7.0 % 3.0 % Private Equity/Debt 12.0 % 7.0 % Cash (15.0) % 0.9 % Total Fund 100.0 % 4.0 % Inflation 2.4 % Long-Term Expected Rate of Return 6.8 % The long-term expected rate of return is 6.8% which is a decrease from 7.0% from the prior year. The long-term expected rate of return on OPEB plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of OPEB plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. Actuarial assumptions Actuarial assumptions are based on the Wisconsin Retirement System experience study conducted in 2021 using experience from 2018 to 2020. The total OPEB liability in the December 31, 2021 actuarial valuation was determined using the following actuarial assumptions, applied to all periods included in the measurement: Actuarial Valuation Date: December 31, 2021 Measurement Date of Net OPEB Liability/(Asset):December 31, 2021 Experience Study January 1, 2018 - December 31, 2020 Published November 18, 2021 Actuarial Cost Method: Entry Age Normal Long-Term Expected Rate of Return: WRS Experience Mortality Table Health Care Cost Trend Rate:6.0% for the first year grading down to an ultimate health care trend rate of 3.5% over a 12 year period. Health Care Premiums Actual premium amounts are used for current annuitants. For all non annuitants (active, preserved, and escrowed members), average premiums are calculated based on non Medicare and Medicare rates for one person and two person coverages. Participation 100% of active and preserved members will begin using sick leave credits immediately upon reaching eligibility. Usage for Escrowed Benefits: 50% of members currently in escrow status will at some point begin using their sick leave balances to pay for health care costs. Sick Leave Accumulation: The assumed annual sick leave accumulation for each individual is at their same rate as in the past (earned less used), but not more than 100% of the gross earned rate based on the person's employer and not less than 25% of their gross earned rate. The assumed annual gross earned rates range from 6.4 to 16.25 days depending on the employer. OPEB plan fiduciary net position.

A.Description of Funds The Health Insurance Fund offers group health insurance for current employees of the State government and of participating local public employers. All public employers in the State are eligible to participate. The State and 393 local employers currently participate. The State and local government portions of the fund are accounted for separately and have separate contribution rates, benefits, and actuarial valuations. The fund includes both a self- insured, fee-for-service plan as well as various prepaid plans, primarily Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO's), a self- insured plan that provides for pharmacy benefits of covered members and a self-insured dental plan that provides dental benefits for members selecting dental insurance. The Income Continuation Insurance Fund offers both long-term and short-term disability benefits (up to 75% of the average monthly earnings) for current employees of the State and of participating local public employers. All public employers in the State are eligible to participate. The State and 278 local employers currently participate in the plan and it is self-insured. The State and local government portions of the fund are accounted for separately and have separate contribution rates, benefits, and actuarial valuations. Since March 2012, premiums have been suspended for the local employers as a result of the funded status of the local employer program. The Duty Disability Fund offers special disability insurance for the State and local WRS participants in protective occupations. Participation in the program is mandatory for all WRS employers with protective occupation employees. The State and 500 local employers currently participate. The plan is self-insured, and the risk is shared between the State and local government employers in the plan. Contributions are actuarially determined and are employer paid. Contributions are based on a graduated, experience-rated formula. During 2021, contribution rates ranged from 0.09% to 2.24% of covered payroll based on employer experience.B.Accounting Policies for Risk Pools Basis of Accounting - All Public Entity Risk Pools are accounted for in enterprise funds using the full accrual basis of accounting and the flow of economic resources measurement focus. Valuation of Investments - Assets of the Health Insurance, Income Continuation Insurance and Duty Disability Insurance funds are invested in the Core Retirement Investment Trust. Investments are valued at fair value. Unpaid Claims Liabilities - Claims liabilities are based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims that have been reported but not settled, and of claims that have been incurred but not reported. The estimate includes the effects of inflation and other societal and economic factors. Adjustments to claims liabilities are charged or credited to expense in the periods in which they are made. Unpaid claims liability is presented at face value and is not discounted for health insurance. It is discounted using an interest rate of 6.8 percent for income continuation and duty disability insurance, as face value of the liability for these programs is not available. The liabilities for income continuation, duty disability, and health insurance were determined by actuarial methods. Administrative Expenses - All maintenance expenses are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Acquisition costs are immaterial and are treated as maintenance expenses. Reinsurance - Health insurance plans provided by HMO's and health insurance for local government annuitants are fully insured by outside insurers. All remaining risk is self-insured with no reinsurance coverage. Risk Transfer - Participating employers are not subject to supplemental assessments in the event of deficiencies. If the assets of the fund were exhausted, participating employers would not be responsible for the fund's liabilities. Premium Setting - Premiums are established by the GIB (Health Insurance and ICI) and ETF Board for Duty Disability in consultation with actuaries. Statutory Authority - All programs are operated under the authority of Chapter 40, Wisconsin Statutes.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 128C.Unpaid Claims Liabilities As discussed in Section B of this Note, each fund establishes a liability for both reported and unreported insured events, which is an estimate of future payments of losses.

SELF-INSURANCE It is the general policy of the State not to purchase commercial insurance for the risks of losses to which it is exposed. Instead, the State believes it is more economical to manage its risks internally and set aside assets for claim settlement in its internal service fund, the Risk Management Fund. The fund services most claims for risk of loss to which the State is exposed, including damage to State owned property, liability for property damages and injuries to third parties, and worker's compensation. All funds and agencies of the State participate in the Risk Management Fund. State Property Damage Property damages to State-owned properties are covered by the State's self-funded property program up to $4.0 million per occurrence and $6.5 million annual aggregate. When claims, which exceed $100,000 per occurrence, total $6.5 million, the State's private insurance becomes available. Losses to property occurring after the annual aggregate are first subject to a $100,000 deductible. The amount of loss in excess of $100,000 is covered by the State's private insurance company. During Fiscal Year 2022 , the excess insurance limits were written to $500 million. The liabilities for State property damage are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. The estimate for future benefits and loss liabilities is based on the reserves on open claims and paid claims. Losses incurred but not reported are expected to be immaterial. Claims incurred but not paid as of June 30, 2022 are estimated to total $12.7 million. Property Damages and Bodily Injuries to Third Parties The State is self-funded for third party liability and effective 7/1/20 retains $5.0 million per occurrence and participates in a 1/6th quota share for the next $6 million excess of the $5 million per occurrence retention. Additional layers of excess insurance are in place above $11 million, with total policy limits during Fiscal Year 2022 at $49.0 million. The liabilities for property damages and injuries to third parties are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. The estimate for future benefits and loss liabilities for the prior fiscal year was the reserves on open claims. The estimate for future benefits and loss liabilities is calculated by an actuary based on the reserves on open claims and prior experience. No liability is reported for environmental impairment liability claims either incurred or incurred but not reported because existing case law makes it unlikely the State would be held liable for material amounts. Because actual claims liabilities depend upon complex factors such as inflation, changes in legal doctrines, and damage awards, the process used in computing claims liability does not necessarily result in an exact amount. Immaterial non-incremental claims adjustment expenses are not included as part of the liability. Claims incurred but not paid as of June 30, 2022 are estimated to total $56.2 million. Worker's Compensation The Worker's Compensation Program was created by Wisconsin Statutes Chapter 102 to provide benefits to workers injured on the job. All employees of the State are included in the program. An injury is covered under worker's compensation if it is caused by an accident that arose out of and in the course of employment. The responsibility for claiming compensation is on the employee. A claim must be filed with the program within two years from the date of injury; otherwise the claim is not allowable. The worker's compensation liability has been determined by an actuary using paid claims and current claims reserves. Liabilities include an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported. Because actual claims liabilities are affected by external factors, the process used in computing claims liabilities does not necessarily result in an exact amount. Claims incurred but not paid as of June 30, 2022 are estimated to total $87.0 million. Changes in the balances of claims liability for the Risk Management Fund during the current and prior fiscal years are as follows (in thousands): 2022 2021 Beginning of fiscal year liability $ 146,478 $ 128,242 Current year claims and changes in estimates 40,443 52,533 year-end $ 152,922 $ 146,478 Settlements have not exceeded coverages for each of the past three fiscal years. Annuity Contracts The Risk Management Fund purchased annuity contracts in various claimants' names to satisfy claim liabilities. The likelihood that the fund will be required to make future payments on those claims is remote and, therefore, the fund is considered to have satisfied its primary liability to the claimants. Accordingly, the annuity contracts are not reported in, and the related liabilities are removed from, the fund's balance sheet. The aggregate outstanding amount of liabilities removed from the financial statements at June 30, 2022 is $4.7 million.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 130NOTE 20. INSURANCE FUNDS A.Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund The Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund was created in 1975 for the purpose of providing excess medical malpractice coverage for claims exceeding the legal primary insurance limits prescribed in Wis. Stat. Section 655.23(4), or the maximum liability limit for which the health care provider is insured, whichever limit is greater. Management of the Fund is vested with a 13-member Board of Governors, which is chaired by the Commissioner of Insurance. Most health care providers permanently practicing or operating in the State of Wisconsin are required to pay Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund assessment fees. Risk of loss is retained by the Fund. The Board of Governors authorized a premium holiday beginning in the fiscal year 2021 and extended the holiday through fiscal year 2022. Also during fiscal year 2021, the Board approved an investment portfolio automatic rebalancing policy, changing the threshold from 20 percent to 17.5 percent. The Future Benefits and Loss Liability account includes individual case estimates for reported losses and estimates for incurred but not reported losses based upon the projected ultimate losses recommended by a consulting actuary. The liability for incurred but not reported losses as of June 30, 2022 , is determined by deducting individual case estimates of the liability for reported losses and net losses paid from inception of the Fund, and adding a risk margin to the projected ultimate loss liabilities, as follows (in thousands): Projected ultimate loss liability $ 1,238,455 Less: Net loss paid from inception (944,398) Less: Liability for reported losses (171,174) Risk Margin 73,514 Liability for incurred but not reported losses $ 196,397 The Future Benefits and Loss Liability account also includes an estimate of the loss adjustment expense (LAE). Using the data available through September 30 of the fiscal year, the actuary estimated the liability for LAE as 18 percent of the estimated unpaid losses as of June 30, 2022. The percentage used in the financial statements was different, since the actuary's estimate was adjusted to reflect actual LAE payments. Specifically, the loss adjustment expenses paid from the inception of the Fund through June 30, 2022, are deducted from the projected ultimate LAE to determine the liability for LAE as June 30, 2022 as follows (in thousands): Projected ultimate LAE liability $ 167,816 Less: LAE paid from inception (115,215) Risk Margin 13,150 Liability for LAE $ 65,751 In accordance with Section Ins. 17.27(3), Wis. Adm. Code, the liability for reported losses, liability for incurred but not reported losses, and liability for loss adjustment expense are maintained on a present value basis with the difference from full value being reported as a contra account to these estimated loss liabilities. These estimated loss liabilities are discounted only to the extent that they are matched by cash and invested assets. Using the actuarially determined discount factor of 0.928, which is based on an investment yield assumption of 2.0 percent approved by the Board of Governors, the discounted loss liability would be as follows as of June 30, 2022 (in thousands): Estimated liability for incurred but not reported losses $ 196,397 Estimated liability for reported losses 171,174 Estimated liability for loss adjustment expense 65,751 Total estimated loss liabilities 433,322 Less: Amount representing interest (31,176) Discounted loss liabilities $ 402,146 Included in the above estimates of loss liabilities, both undiscounted and discounted, is a 25 percent risk margin, which was recommended by the actuary and approved by the Board of Governors. The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance contracts for periodic actuarial audits of the Fund. This audit includes a review by another actuary of the reasonableness of the actuarial methodology and assumptions used in developing estimates of the Fund's liabilities. The actuarial audits have concluded that the Fund's loss liability estimates are reasonable, although conservative. The Fund's contracted actuary has considered the recommendations made in the actuarial audits and appropriately incorporated any necessary changes based on those recommendations into the actuarial methodology and assumptions used to calculate the Fiscal Year 2022 liabilities estimate. In addition to discounted loss liabilities, the Future Benefit and Loss Liabilities account also includes a future medical expenses liability and a contributions being held liability. The future medical expenses liability consists of those accounts required by Wis. Stat. Sec. 655.015 to be established if a settlement or judgment provides for future medical expense payments in excess of $100,000. The accounts are managed by the Fund and earn a proportionate share of the Fund's interest. Any account balance remaining when a claimant dies reverts back to the Fund. The contributions being held liability consists of nonrefundable payments, generally in amounts equal to the primary coverage in effect for related claims, that primary insurers have voluntarily presented to the Fund and which are negotiable with the Fund in exchange for a release of payment for any future defense costs that may be incurred on the claim. This amount is held as a liability to the Fund until a payment on the claim is made. The breakdown of Future Benefit and Loss Liabilities, including the portions that are estimated as current and noncurrent as of June 30, 2022 (in thousands), is as follows: Discounted loss liabilities $ 402,146 Future medical expense liability 61,707 Total estimated loss liabilities 463,853 Current portion (56,039) Noncurrent portion $ 407,814 The uncertainties inherent in projecting the frequency and severity of large claims because of the Injured Patients and Families State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 131Compensation Fund's unlimited liability coverage and extended reporting and settlement periods makes it likely that the amounts ultimately paid will differ from the recorded estimated loss liabilities. These differences cannot be quantified. The estimated amounts included in the balance of Future Benefits and Loss Liabilities are continually reviewed and adjusted as the Fund gains additional experience. Such adjustments are reflected in current operations. Because of the changes in these estimates, the benefit expense for the fiscal year is not necessarily indicative of the loss experience for the year. The following is a reconciliation of the change in the balance of Future Benefits and Loss Liabilities during Fiscal Year 2022 (in thousands): Liability at the beginning of the year $ 428,807 Incurred claims and related expenses for the current year and the change in estimated amounts for claims incurred in prior years 45,015 Less: current year payments attributable to claims incurred in current and prior years (9,968) Liability at the end of the year $ 463,854 B. State Life Insurance Fund The State Life Insurance Fund was created under Chapter 607, Wisconsin Statutes, to offer life insurance to residents of Wisconsin in a manner similar to private insurers. This fund functions much like a mutual life insurance company and is subject to the same regulatory requirements as any life insurance company licensed to operate in Wisconsin. Premiums are reported as earned when due. Benefits and expenses are associated with earned premiums so as to result in recognition of profits over the life of the contracts. This association is accomplished by means of the provision for liabilities for future benefits and the amortization of acquisition costs. The State Life Insurance Fund does not pay commissions nor does it incur agent expenses. Future benefits and loss liabilities have been computed by the net level premium method based upon estimated future investment yield and mortality. The composition of liabilities and the more material assumptions pertinent thereto are presented below (in thousands):Issue YearOrdinary Life Insurance in ForceAmount of of Assumption YearInterest Rate Mortality CSO, ALB, Aggregate * Age Next Birthday All of the State Life Insurance Fund's life insurance in force is participating. This Fund is required by statute to maintain surplus at a level between 7 percent and 10 percent of statutorily admitted assets as far as practicably possible. All excess surplus is to be returned to the policyholders in the form of policyholder dividends. Policyholder dividends are declared each year in order to achieve the required level of surplus. The statutory assets at December 31, 202 1 were $112.9 million and statutory capital and surplus was $10.5 million. Fund equity at June 30, 2022 was $11.6 million.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 132NOTE 21. SEGMENT INFORMATION AND CONDENSED FINANCIAL DATA Primary Government The State issues revenue bonds as a component of the total funding for the Direct Loan Portfolio, which is accounted for as part of the Environmental Improvement Fund. The Direct Loan Portfolio is also funded by grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\"). Loans in this portfolio are made for water and wastewater projects. Repayments from loans in this portfolio, grants and revenue bond proceeds are used to fund new loans. The Environmental Improvement Fund has pledged future loan revenues, net of specified operating expenses, to repay outstanding revenue bonds. Investors in these revenue bonds rely solely on the revenues generated from the loans within the Direct Loan Portfolio.

LITIGATION, CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS A.Litigation and Contingencies The State is a participant in various legal proceedings pertaining to matters incidental to the performance of routine governmental operations. The State accrues liabilities related to legal proceedings, if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Such losses, totaling $0.6 million on June 30, 2022 reported in the governmental activities, are discussed below: The Work Injury Supplemental Benefit Fund, administered by the Department of Workforce Development, provides compensatory payments to survivors of fatally injured employees or disabled employees with work-related injuries. The liability for annuities to be paid totaled $0.6 million at June 30, 2022 . Other Claims, Judgments, and Contingencies The State is also named as a party in other legal proceedings where the ultimate disposition and consequence are not presently determinable. The potential loss amount relating to an unfavorable outcome for certain of these proceedings could not be reasonably determined at this time. However, the ultimate dispositions and consequences of any single legal proceeding or all legal proceedings collectively should not have a material adverse effect on the State's financial position. In August 2018, the Department of Health Services (DHS) received notification from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommending a $27.6 million disallowance related to the Medicaid program. DHHS concluded DHS did not refund the full federal share of Medicaid-related settlements and judgements from October 2008 through September 2016. DHS partially disagreed with the report. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reviewed the report and determined that DHHS underreported the settlement and requested that DHS refund $31.0 million to the federal government. In February 2021 DHS submitted a formal objection letter to CMS and in August 2022 CMS issued a disallowance in the amount of $24.9 million. DHS intends to appeal this disallowance. St. Mary's Springs Academy filed a just compensation appeal against the Department of Transportation (DOT). The issue is the amount of compensation to St. Mary's Springs Academy for property acquisition as part of a highway project. Depending on the verdict, DOT may be liable for additional damages and attorney's fees. It is believed that the maximum total liability would be approximately $1.8 million because of damages already paid by DOT. It is the State's position that it is not liable for any new compensation or fees and costs of St. Mary's. The State is vigorously defending this case, with mediation scheduled for December 2022 and a trial scheduled for March 2023. KJS Amoco Inc. filed a civil lawsuit against DOT for relocation benefits due to commercial displacement following DOT's total acquisition of leased property. The plaintiff is seeking payment of approximately $11.4 million. DOT successfully obtained dismissal of a second plaintiff and the claims of that plaintiff. Cross motions for summary judgement on the remaining claim have been filed and are in the process of being briefed, with a trial date not yet scheduled. It is the State's position that it is not liable for this claim and is vigorously defending this case. At the end of FY 2022, the Unemployment Reserve Fund, administered by the Department of Workforce Development (DWD), had a backlog related to weekly claims filed. DWD accrued a liability in the Unemployment Reserve Fund for benefits paid through October 31, 2022 that were related to weeks prior to June 30, 2022. However, an estimate of payments related to the remaining backlog, totaling 5,926 adjudication issues and 1,369 appeals as of October 30, 2022, cannot be estimated and therefore a liability for these claims has not been reported. A class action lawsuit alleging discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA as well violation of the \"when due\" clause of the Social Security Act and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was filed against the DWD in September 2021. The plaintiffs seek to invalidate Wis Stat. 108.04(12)(f) and 108.04(2)(h) which prohibit recipients of social security disability insurance payments from receiving regular unemployment compensation benefits. In addition to an injunction, the plaintiffs seek back payments for any weeks that members of the class would have been eligible for regular unemployment benefits, excluding the weeks for which they received PUA instead, and reimbursement for any collection costs and penalties. The case was pled as a class action, but the State successfully moved for an order allowing the district court to rule on a summary judgement motion first. That summary judgement motion is now pending, which seeks complete dismissal of the case. Several employees of the Department of Corrections (DOC) filed a Wis. Stat. Chapter 109 wage claim action against DOC seeking unpaid wages for tasks they claim are integral and indispensable to their primary work duties. The plaintiffs are seeking class action certification, which was granted in September 2022 by the circuit court. DOJ has appealed the decision certifying the class, with an opening brief due in December 2022. The State is vigorously defending its position. In FY 2020, Intersystems Corporation filed a claim against the Department of Revenue (DOR) asserting that DOR owed Intersystems Corporation a refund of $73.9 million plus interest for 2010-2017. The issue is whether or not fees from sublicensing software sold to Epic, who is domiciled in Wisconsin, may be treated as Wisconsin sales in the sales factor. The case is currently being appealed to the Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission, but DOR believes that its position is meritorious and will defend the matter vigorously. In FY 2022, Caidan Enterprises Incorporated filed a claim against DOR asserting that DOR owed Caidan approximately $15.0 million in income tax and interest for the 2015-2018 tax years because Caidan should not pay taxes on gain that was not unitary. The case is currently being appealed to the Wisconsin Tax Appeals Commission, but DOR believes the gain was not unitary and will defend the matter vigorously. B. Commitments Primary Government As of June 30, 2022 , encumbrances of the General Fund totaled $1.9 billion, encumbrances of the Transportation Fund totaled $2.1 billion, and encumbrances of other non-major governmental funds totaled $216.2 million.

Loans and grants are made to local units of government for wastewater treatment projects for terms of up to 20 years. Loans are made at a number of prescribed interest rates based on environmental priority. The loans contractually are revenue obligations or general obligations of the local governmental units. Additionally, various statutory provisions exist which provide further security for payment. The Fund has made financial assistance commitments of $257.6 million as of June 30, 2022 . These loan and grant commitments are expected to be met through proceeds from issuance of revenue obligations and additional federal grants. The Injured Patients and Families Compensation Fund may be required to purchase an annuity as a result of a claim settlement. Under specific annuity arrangements, the Fund may have ultimate responsibility for annuity payments if the annuity company defaults on annuity payments. The total estimated replacement value of the Fund's annuities as of June 30, 2022 was $32.8 million. The replacement value calculation includes only annuities where the Fund remains the owner. Annuities with qualified assignments are no longer included. The Fund reserves the right to pursue collection from State guarantee funds. State Public Deposit Guarantee - As required by Wis. Stat. Sec. 34.08, the State is to make payments to public depositors for proofs of loss (e.g., loss resulting from a bank failure) up to $400 thousand per depositor above the amount of federal insurance. This statutory requirement guarantees that the State will make payments in favor of the public depositor that has submitted a proof of loss. Payments would be made in the order in which satisfactory proofs of loss are received by the State's Department of Financial Institutions, until the designated appropriation is exhausted. At June 30, 2022 , the appropriation available totaled $75.4 million. Losses become fixed as of the date of the loss. A public depositor experiencing a loss must assign its interest in the deposit, to the extent of the amount paid, to the Department of Financial Institutions. Any recovery made by the Department of Financial Institutions under the assignment is to be repaid to the appropriation. The possibility of a material loss resulting from payments to and recovery from public depositors is remote.State of Wisconsin Notes to The Financial Statements For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 138NOTE 25. TAX ABATEMENTS Wisconsin statutes authorize tax abatements to encourage economic development and other actions beneficial to the State or its citizens resulting in a reduction in tax revenue the State would otherwise be entitled to collect. GASB Statement No. 77, Tax Abatement Disclosures , requires disclosure of tax abatement agreements entered into by a reporting government, along with agreements entered into by other governments, which reduce the reporting government's tax revenues. Most tax abatement programs meeting the criteria for disclosure in the State's ACFR are certified by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC), a separate legal entity also reported as a component unit in the ACFR. WEDC enters into the abatement agreements and administers the programs. The Wisconsin Department of Revenue (DOR) is responsible for ensuring the certified tax abatements were properly applied when processing income tax returns filed by recipients.

Consequently, BREIT repurchased approximately 43% of each investor's repurchase request in November 2022. In December 2022, redemption restrictions were implemented and only 0.3% of the fund NAV will be eligible for repurchase. If BREIT receives elevated repurchase requests in the first quarter of 2023, Blackstone intends to fulfill repurchases at the 2% of NAV monthly limit, subject to the 5% of NAV quarterly limit.

Under the modified approach, infrastructure assets are not depreciated as long as the State can demonstrate that these assets are properly managed and are being preserved at or above an established condition level. Instead of depreciation, the costs to maintain and preserve infrastructure assets are expensed, while additions and improvements are capitalized. The State owns approximately 11,200 centerline miles of road and 5,100 bridges. Road Network Condition assessments are completed on a two-year cycle with the most current results reported for each State road. The State completes the assessment of the Eastern half of the State in one year and the Western half of the State in the next. Numerous measures are used to assess the condition of the State's road network. The State has adopted the International Roughness Index (IRI), as defined by the Federal Highway Administration, as one of its condition measures. IRI is a direct measure of road roughness, with an IRI of 2.69 mm/m (170 inches/mile) or greater being defined as a \"poor\" ride. Roads with a \"poor\" IRI assessment may cause negative impacts for the traveling public by decreasing driver comfort and potentially increasing the damage to vehicles and goods. It is the State's policy to ensure no more than 15 percent of its roads receive a \"poor\" IRI assessment. Recent condition assessment results are as follows: Year Ended June 30Miles of 11,200 7.3 15.0 7.7 8.3 15.0 6.7 2013 11,200 6.2 15.0 8.8Each year the State estimates the costs to maintain and preserve the road network at, or above, the established condition level. Actual maintenance/preservation costs compare to estimates as follows: Year Ended June 30Estimated Costs (In millions)Actual Costs (In millions)Variance (In millions) 2013 580.9 561.8 19.1 Estimated costs are developed at the beginning of the fiscal year based on projects planned for the current and future years. The types of projects ultimately contracted and incurring costs during the year are often very different. In addition, the State of Wisconsin, Department of Transportation's multi-year contracting process, allowing encumbrances to carry forward, makes a comparison of actual to estimated amounts difficult since expenditures for the current year may have been budgeted and committed to a project in prior years. Bridge Network Condition assessments are completed on a two-year cycle, with more frequent inspections completed if warranted. The most current assessment results are reported for each State bridge, making the overall assessment a blend of measures completed in the current fiscal year and those completed in the prior year. The structural condition rating is a broad measure of the condition of a bridge. Each bridge is rated using three National Bridge Inventory (NBI) condition codes and two NBI appraisal ratings. The three NBI condition codes are Deck Condition, Superstructure Condition, and Substructure Condition. The two NBI appraisal ratings are Structural Evaluation and Waterway Adequacy. The NBI uses a 10-point scale for condition codes and appraisal ratings. A bridge is considered \"structurally deficient\" if any condition code is 4 or less, or if either appraisal code is 2 or less.State of Wisconsin Required Supplementary Information For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 150\"Structurally deficient\" bridges cause negative impacts for the public by increasing the likelihood that heavy loads will need to be rerouted to less efficient routes, thus increasing logistic costs for State businesses. It is the State's policy to ensure no more than 15 percent of its bridges are \"structurally deficient\".

BUDGETARY INFORMATION A. Budgetary - GAAP Reporting Reconciliation The accompanying Budgetary Comparison Schedule compares the legally adopted budget (more fully described in RSI Note 1-B) with actual data on a budgetary basis.

The final budget is primarily a general purpose revenue and expenditure budget. General purpose revenues consist of general taxes and miscellaneous receipts which are paid into the General Fund, lose their identity, and are then available for appropriation by the Legislature. The remaining revenues consist of program revenues, which are credited by law to an appropriation to finance a specified program or State agency, and segregated revenues which are paid into separate identifiable funds. While State departments and agencies are required to submit estimates of expected revenues for program revenue and segregated revenue categories, these estimates are not formally incorporated into the adopted budget except for revenue estimates of the Lottery Fund. As a result, legally budgeted revenues for these categories are not available and, consequently, actual amounts are reported in the budget column of the Budgetary Comparison Schedules. Expenditure budgeting differs for the various types of appropriations. For most appropriations, budgeted expenditures equal the amount from the adopted budget plus any subsequent legislative or administrative revisions. Various supplemental appropriations were approved during the year and have been incorporated into the budget figures. While State statutes prohibit spending beyond budgetary authority, a provision is made to include the value of accounts receivable, inventories and work in process in identifying available revenues. The State also utilizes nonbudget accounts for which no budget is established but expenditures may be incurred. As a result, actual expenditures may exceed budgeted amounts in certain categories. The budgetary basis of accounting required by State law differs materially from the basis used to report revenues and expenditures in accordance with GAAP. Other variances arise because the State's biennial budget is developed according to the statutorily required fund structure which differs extensively from the fund structure used in the GAAP basis financial statements. This difference is primarily caused by the elimination of the University of Wisconsin System, and various fiduciary, proprietary and other governmental fund activities from the statutorily General and Transportation funds. In addition, funds such as the Medical Assistance Trust, Hospital Assessment, Budget Stabilization and Permanent Endowment, special revenue funds under statutory reporting, are included as part of the General Fund under GAAP reporting. As a consequence of these differences, a reconciliation between budgetary basis and GAAP basis is provided in Note 1-A of the notes to the required supplementary information. The Budgetary Comparison Schedules for the General and the Transportation Fund present both the original and final appropriated budgets, as well as the actual inflows, outflows, and fund balance on the budgetary basis. The supplementary budget comparison schedule provides this same information (with the exception of the original budget data) for the nonmajor governmental funds with annual budgets. The capital project and debt service funds are excluded from this schedule because no comprehensive budget is approved for these funds. One special revenue fund, the Wisconsin Public Broadcasting Foundation, has been excluded from reporting because it is a blended component unit that is neither budgeted nor included under statutory reporting. Of the permanent funds, only the Historical Society Fund and a portion of the Common School and Normal School funds are budgeted.The State's biennial budget was enacted on July 8, 2021 and published on July 9, 2021. This legislation is recognized by State officials as the original budget and is treated as such on the Budgetary Comparison Schedules. While the legal level of budgetary control for the reported funds is maintained at the appropriation line as specified by the Legislature in Chapter 20 of the Wisconsin Statutes, this level of detail is impractical for inclusion in the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report. Accordingly, a supplementary report is available upon request which provides budgetary comparisons at the legal level of control. Unexpended appropriation balances lapse at year-end or forward to the subsequent fiscal year depending on the type of appropriation involved: Continuing - unexpended balances automatically forward to ensuing years until fully depleted or repealed by subsequent action of the Legislature. Annual : General Purpose Revenue - unencumbered balances lapse at year end. Program Revenue - unexpended cash balances may be forwarded to the next fiscal year. Biennial - unexpended balances or deficits automatically forward to the second year. At the end of the second year all unencumbered general purpose revenue balances lapse. Sum sufficient - moneys are appropriated and expended in the amounts necessary to accomplish the purpose specified. Encumbrances may be carried over to the next fiscal year as a revision to the budgetary appropriation with Department of Administration approval. Under budgetary reporting, encumbrances are treated like expenditures and are shown as a reduction of fund balance.State of Wisconsin Notes to Required Supplementary Information For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022 157 "}
