Follow up is provided to callers to ensure proper safety assessment and linkages to services. Services are free and available 24-7. 2. Importance: The suicide rate among veterans is about triple the average rate for the general population. Prevalence of suicide in the military and co-occurring issues with transition to civilian life requires specialized supports. Connectedness is key to survival of persons contemplating suicide. 3. Performance: During this year's pilot, 2,571 veterans and family members were provided emotional support and info and referral. Veteran peers were available to callers 976 times. More than 50% of callers were enrolled in care coordination services. 4. History: 2014-15 funding - $150,000 NR GR. 5.

Description: If selected by DCF as the certification entity, funding will develop and implement a certification program for the professional competence of recovery residence administrators. The program will be scientifically valid and reliable and include scope of service study, validation study, publication of the study, and exam development. 2. Importance: Recovery residence administrators are charged with meeting health, safety and quality service needs of individuals entering the residences as a means to continue recovery from alcohol/drug addiction. Ensuring competency helps protect the persons who reside in the residences and the community. 3. Performance: Measurements include completion of the tangible products listed above. Individuals who relapse often do so at a cost to the state through uncompensated care, cycling through state funded programs or the criminal justice system. 4. History: New project. Received $200K per year through DCF's budget for core training for certification since FY 2004/2005. 5.

Description: Funding develops infrastructure for national standards that supports initial and ongoing residence certification of recovery residences. Since 2012, this organization has received applications from 750 homes for voluntary certification and one half have been certified. 2. Importance: National standards ensure residences deliver environments that are alcohol and drug free; safe and clean; support recovery through peer interaction; and are good neighbors and responsible citizens. Certification ensures consumers have access to housing that assists in their recovery and protects their rights. 3. Performance: Individuals who relapse often so do at a cost to the state through uncompensated care, cycling through state funded or other health plan services or through the criminal justice system. 4. History: New project. No state contract history. 5. Other: HB 21, passed in the 2015 session, creates a voluntary certification program for recovery residences and administrators.

Description: This initiative funds centralized receiving facilities designed for individuals needing evaluation, stabilization or crisis services. The department is required to create a matching grant program to fund costs of these facilities. Each award must be matched at a one-to-one ratio of state and local funds. Funds may be used to support start-up or ongoing costs. The department is required to work with local agencies to support development of these facilities. 2. Importance: Centralized receiving facilities serve individuals with mental health and/or substance abuse disorders. These facilities provide a single point of entry for multiple behavioral health providers, conduct initial assessments and triage, provide case management, and divert individuals from jails and hospitals. There are three such facilities in the state (Fort Myers, Orlando and Osceola) and the goal of this grant program is to support the creation of more facilities throughout the state. The single point of entry is beneficial to police officers. 3.

Description: Purchases a van for The Key Clubhouse. The Key Clubhouse is a mental health rehabilitation program for ages 18 and up focused on work recovery and daily ongoing support for people with severe mental illness. The van will transport members to and from bus stops and the Metrorail to attend the Clubhouse, which is a requirement to attain employment. The van will also be used to transport members to and from interviews and social events. 2. Importance: The majority of members do not have transportation. Social events help alleviate the isolation that a person with a mental illness lives with on a daily basis. Supported employment creates stability. 3. Performance: Daily ongoing support is provided at a lower cost than hospitalization or incarceration. 1999 research shows members are 1/3 less l kely to have crisis hospitalization and 2 1/2 less likely to be incarcerated. 4.

The target population is 18 years of age and older who are suffering from co- occurring disorders of mental health and an addiction who are experiencing difficulty functioning in the community and those who are at risk of being admitted to the state hospital. 2. Importance: The program will utilize a comprehensive treatment approach designed to facilitate reintegration, recovery and stability in the community. 3. Performance: Many of these individuals, in the absence of treatment, are subject to costly incarceration, criminalization, homelessness, neglect, and exploitation. Outcomes will measure reductions in arrests, convictions, and incarcerations, mental illness hospitalizations, and emergency room visits; and increases in employability, wages, and number of days of 337 7/9/2015 2:54 PM 2015 Issues by Appropriation and Project Unit Dept Line Project Title County Legislator GR Trust Total GR N/R Comments HHS DCF 377 M 4 Clay Behavioral Health Care CenterClay Bradley, Cummings, Harrell300,000 - 300,000 300,000 1.Description: Supports a short-term alternative to state/other hospitalization for individuals with severe and persistent mental illness or co-occurring disorders who are experiencing an acute mental or emotional crisis. This 6 bed residential Crisis Alternative Program is part of a statewide effort to keep individuals with severe mental illnesses in the community. 2. Importance: Program includes a family intervention specialist who works to keep the family intact while the individual is hospitalized. Many are parents or caretakers who, if placed at the state institution, would cause major disruption to their family support system, requiring housing/placement of children or older parents. 3. Performance: FY 2013-14, data shows that 2% of all admissions were referred for more intensive services. Providing services to people who need intervention in crisis is less costly the earlier the need is identified. Providing services to substance abusing parents and maintaining families is less expensive than removing children and placing them in the care of the state. 4.

Description: Expands its existing training center to take the lead as a statewide standardized, centralized, and customized training center for behavioral health care providers. The center will develop and conduct trainings and provide technical assistance. Emphasis will be on evidence- based and promising treatment/recovery practices that are culturally responsive. 2. Importance: Florida does not have a centralized training and technical assistance center for behavioral health. The Center will collaborate with multidisciplinary partners to meet workforce needs, reduce duplication and merge talents across the state. Benefits to the workforce include improving outcomes and services for individuals with co-occurring disorders. 3. Performance: Behavioral health professions decrease costs associated with criminal activity, health care and decreased employment earnings. Studies of outpatient treatment find that every dollar yields $1.33-$23.33 in economic benefits; residential treatment yields $1.68-$9.70 in benefits. 4. History: New.

Description: Develops a four year psychiatric residency program at Manatee Glens, a specialty hospital for mental health and addictions. Approved by the American Osteopathic Association and Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, the program plans to accept three physicians a year up to a total of twelve for a four year psychiatric residency program. 2. Importance: Florida is challenged by a severe shortage of physicians within the medical specialty of psychiatry. According to the Florida Department of Health, seventeen Florida counties have no licensed psychiatric physicians. Floridians residing in these counties must travel out of their home county or forego psychiatric treatment. Residents in many more counties experience psychiatry shortages resulting in long wait lists for psychiatric care. 3. Performance: For a $300,000 investment, Florida will receive a medical education costing $670,000 annually. DOH reports that almost two out of three medical residents that train in the state, remain to practice in the state where they train. 4. History: New. 14-15 & 13-14 = CAT team funding.

Description: Increases partnerships with pediatricians and other primary care providers who have received specialized training (Primary Pediatric Psychopharmacology training) for outpatient mental health services to children and adolescents. 2. Importance: There is a shortage of child/adolescent psychiatrists nationally and in Florida. This project is based on similar efforts in New York and Massachusetts and aims to coordinate publicly funded behavioral health care services with primary providers to increase their expertise and capacity to meet patient needs. This will enable earlier interventions. 3. Performance: Target population is children and adolescents ages 5-17 with disorders treatable by medications and/or outpatient treatment strategies. Care that is not provided often results in increased costs borne by government. Children and adolescents will receive mental health services when needed and will be more likely to be successful in school, less l kely to enter the juvenile justice system, child welfare system and seek intensive services (i.e. hospitalization or residential treatment). 4.

Importance: Florida is challenged by a severe shortage of physicians within the medical specialty of psychiatry. According to DOH, 17 Florida counties do not have licensed psychiatrists. Floridians residing in these counties must travel out of county or forego psychiatric treatment. Residents in many more counties experience psychiatry shortages resulting in long wait lists for psychiatric care. 3. Performance: Increasing the number of residency slots will attract qualified medical professionals. DOH reports that almost two out of three medical residents that train in the state, remain to practice in the state where they train. 4. History: New project.

This facility operates sixty-two inpatient beds as a public Baker Act receiving facility. 2. Importance: Lifestream Behavioral Center (LSBC) is the only Baker Act receiving facility in Lake or Sumter county. If this funding is not provided, these 5 unreimbursed beds will close. LSBC is providing Baker Act care to indigent state patients. 3. Performance: This facility states they contract at a cost below market rates resulting in savings of $180,000 per bed per year. Services divert more costly services such as hospitals and emergency rooms and stabilization services in jail or prison. 4. History: 14-15=547,500 NR GR.

Job training in areas of customer service, culinary arts, landscaping and maintenance, phone reception, clerical, graphic arts and retail sales. This is an expansion of the Vincent House Recovery through Work program in Pinellas County. 2. Importance: This program will assist adults with mental illness to enter the workforce (often for the first time) and become self-sufficient. 3. Performance: Persons with severe and persistent mental illness comprise the most costly disability group on governmental benefits and the group with the highest level of unemployment (85-90% nationwide). In FY 2014, the program in Pinellas earned $750,000 at 44 businesses. Over the past five years, members collectively earned $2.5 million in employment settings. 4. History: Hernando is new.

Importance: Decrease use of costly services, effective transition between levels of care to improve adherence to treatment recommendations. Improved access to healthcare in a population with high risk co-morbidities and high morbidity and mortality. 3. Performance: Health homes for this population is relatively new and data is scarce. ROI will largely rest in hospital and ED utilization. Clinical research shows better health outcomes when care is coordinated through the provider of their most serious condition.

The program provides low income housing, case management or supportive housing to maintain independent community living in a stable and assisted manner. Funding provides 16 beds and 7.5 supportive housing staff. 2. Importance: Housing without supportive services does not reduce recidivism. With wraparound services and affordable housing, clients remain stable while living dependently which reduces acute care admission. 3. Performance: This program's average cost per day is $16.50 vs. single hospital discharge of $1,966. The program uses this appropriation as state match for $1M federal funds. In FY 14-15, 138 clients were provided supportive assistance; 14 clients were maintained in assisted living. 4.

DACS does not competitively bid each project, and contracts with one company for the cumulative amount of funds provided for operations and construction over the years - reissuing a contract with the company annually to capture new legislative appropriations. 2. Importance: ROI is unclear, as funds were not competitively bid to determine the highest level of nutrient reduction per dollar. It is unclear if the estimated level of nutrient reduction is above or below what the free market would produce. DACS states that the existing six hybrid wetlands have resulted in a 67-93% reduction in phosphorus that is ultimately entering Lake Okeechobee and a 50% reduction of nitrogen. 3. Other: CY: $19M (includes $5M in base) for the construction of 2 new HWTT and 2 new FAVT projects and O&M for existing projects. ENV ACS 1380 3 Springs Protection BMPs - 5,000,000 5,000,000 - 1. Description: Recurring LATF funding to support farmer BMP implementation, evaluate existing and next generation BMPs and to provide related economic evaluations to help protect springs. The majority of funding will be used to provide cost share to farmers in order to implement BMPs including crop management, tool use, improved irrigation system efficiency and advanced irrigation management in freshwater springs recharge areas. 2. Importance: 1.7 million acres of agricultural lands in spring recharge areas have not yet implemented BMPs, which are critical to the protection of springs in Florida. Funding will help assist producers with the implementation of cost shared practices to enhance and improve water quality in these critical springs recharge areas. It should be noted that these projects could be duplicative of those included in DEP's springs restoration efforts. 3.

Description: Provides 350K in funds from the Highway Safety Operating Trust Fund for the replacement of 20 non-pursuit vehicles with over 120k miles and/or are over twelve (12) years of age. This will allow the Department to maintain a fleet management program, annually replacing 20% of the total fleet that exceeds 80k miles. 2. Importance: The Department of Management Services criteria for non- pursuit vehicle replacement is 120k miles and/or twelve years in age. The Division of Motorist Services will have seventy-eight vehicles that will meet or exceed that criteria by June 30, 2015. This issue establishes base funding of $350k allowing the Division to replace twenty (20) vehicles annually. These vehicles are used extensively by mobile home and automobile dealer inspectors and instructors, hearing officers, driver license examiners, law enforcement instructors and field training officers, among others to fulfill their job responsibilities. In FY 2013-14 the Division spent $185k for repairs and estimates that $235k will be spent during FY #27; This is a new request with no prior funding.

Description: Provides funds to continue a 5 year initiative to replace and improve the Motorist Services driver credentialing issuance systems. This phase is comprised of replacing the primary Driver License Issuance System (FDLIS) and providing tax collectors with the option to renew driver licenses. 2. Importance: Florida's credentialing systems used to issue driver license and motor vehicle titles and registrations are at end-of-life, being more than 30 years old. This requires more resources to maintain. The current systems do not \"talk\" to each other and take a long time to implement. Software is outdated; therefore finding a contractor to work on the program is difficult and expensive. This places Florida at risk of receiving delayed revenue from driver license issuance services and also reduced federal funds that are distr buted to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles and to the Department of Transportation. The annual revenues collected are approximately $2.7b. 2668 1 OPPAGA Corrections Study {Statewide} {unknown} 300,000 - 300,000 300,000 1.
