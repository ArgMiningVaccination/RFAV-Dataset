MO, USA. 1994-1999 Research Scientist II and Project Leader (1997-1999) Research Scientist I (1995-1997) Senior Research Investigator (1994-1995) Research Interests Chronic pain, including pain caused by chemotherapeutics for cancer, is a devastating global health problem, a major unresolved healthcare issue, with tremendous socio-economic implications, particularly for long-term sufferers. For example, annual US expenditures related to pain (including direct medical costs and lost wages) are higher than those for cancer ($243 bn), heart diseases ($309 bn) and Woodcock et al., 2007; Nightingale, 2012; Pizzo and Clark, 2012). Chronic pain is poorly managed and novel therapeutic agents are unquestionably needed. Using a multidisciplinary approach that includes genetic, molecular, bio-analytical, biochemical and pharmacological tools, my lab is interested in understanding how neuro-inflammatory processes are engaged in the periphery and CNS during the development of chronic neuropathic pain with particular focus on: - peroxynitrite induced nitroxidative stress - ceramide-to-S1P pathway - adenosine-to A3 adenosine receptor signaling pathway. We are also interested in exploring the contribution of these pathways in the development of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and antinociceptive tolerance known to hamper the effective use of opioids for pain management. Our efforts in these areas have opened a new field of pain research directed toward modulating critical mediators of pain rather than masking symptoms through traditional approaches. Novel chemical entities that specifically target these pathways are also evaluated through our collaborative efforts with the ultimate goal of initiating proof of concept clinical trials. We have already seen important efficacy increases by synergizing our targeted interventions with currently used analgesics. These large increases in pain relief achievable by targeting multiple synergistic pathways provide a clear path forward for reducing dose and toxicities observed with currently used analgesic drugs.
