However, the reasons behind this are far from ideal\u2014 the effects of pollution, poor diets and aging are taking their toll, and we are all searching for ways to feel better. Unfortunately, many doctors often prescribe medication immediately to control or target the symptoms of illness and disease, without addressing the underlying issues. Eventually, we may get ill from the side effects of prescription medicines, or have our health problems worsen over time. The holistic approach is a more natural, comprehensive way of dealing with health issues and chronic conditions. Holistic medicine doesn't just treat the symptoms, but instead digs deeper to finds the true cause of the problem. Many chronic conditions are simply the side effects of issues that have yet to be diagnosed and addressed. Doctors who adhere to the philosophy of holistic medicine don't just treat a condition by offering medication as a solution. Instead, holistic practitioners investigate their patient's entire condition, including their mental health and lifestyle. Whether the symptoms are joint pain, allergies, fibromyalgia or another chronic condition, our goal is to help you achieve optimal health and a better quality of life. Holistic healing relies on the quality of the relationship that the doctor has with the patient. Physicians who strive to form an understanding of the person as a whole are better able to find solutions to their patients' health and well-being. The art of holistic health embraces two-way communication, instead of a doctor simply giving a diagnosis and medicating the illness with a one-size fits all approach. Integrative medicine is similar to holistic medicine, in that it takes a big-picture approach to understand the systems of the human body and its overall health. Those who practice integrative medicine are open to all forms of treatment, whether it's naturopathic or chemical, so long as it's the ideal treatment to help the patient. However, the basic idea of targeting the underlying causes of sickness is fundamentally the same in both forms of medicine. Doctors of integrative and holistic practices dedicate themselves to healing naturally when they can and promoting a balanced lifestyle. Our medical team offers a variety of treatment options from both holistic and integrative medicine, and we're ready to help you regain and maintain a life free from distress and illness. If you're already in great physical condition, then we can help you maintain your overall health and strive for a long and active life. We incorporate all of the concepts of integrative, holistic and natural healing. It's our goal to keep you free from prescription drugs that could have damaging effects over time - when possible, whether it's treating high blood pressure and chronic fatigue, or lyme disease. However, we can and do use prescriptions when necessary, with the goal of eliminating or reducing those meds in the future, if and when possible. A large part of what we do is educating our patients. Even the most health-conscious clients are interested in our up to date, data-focused information on nutrition, disease control, exercise and healthy habits. Informing our patients of their options when it comes to their body, minds and emotional health is the first step in building a strong foundation for a balanced condition. We find that when people are well informed and understand what their body is telling them, then it is much easier to fix the health problem and get them on the road to wellness. We provide an array of naturopathic and holistic services for everyone. Whether you're fatigued, in chronic pain or suffering from a range of other issues, we can help. Our approach works because we listen to what you have to say. We don't believe in the doctor telling the patient what to do. Instead, we require input from you in order to help our doctor make an accurate diagnosis and then to plan an appropriate treatment. Our recommendations will include lifestyle changes like a nutrition and exercise plan. Meditation and herbs may be part of the healing plan too. We will also check in with you regarding your mental health and whether you have any unhealthy habits that you want to break. Our services cover a variety of areas\u2014 a few examples include wellness check-ups, pain management, allergy treatment, IV therapy, hormone replacement therapy, ozone therapy, integrative cancer treatment and more. The holistic doctor will check any specific issues that are bothering you. These may be signs of deeper problems that need to be addressed, including the need for chelation therapy or testosterone replacement. We offer forms of treatment that target and treat issues at the source, including joint injections that utilize prolozone and prolotherapy. If you need guidance when it comes to dietary and nutrition concerns, then our experienced doctor is here to help come up with a plan to meet your goals for weight control. We can provide assistance in the case of stress, anxiety, chronic fatigue, mood swings and depression using integrative and holistic medicine to relieve these difficult issues and help you regain control.
