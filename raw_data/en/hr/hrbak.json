In this study, we recruited a total of 216 SARS-CoV-2-na\u00efve healthy donors of various ages (23-81 years) who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and assessed age-associated differences in vaccine-induced T-cell responses and adverse effects over 3 months. We observed that older adults (65 years) had fewer vaccine-induced Spike-specific CD4 +T cells, including CXCR3 +cTfh and Th1 cells, after the first dose, which correlated with their lower peak IgG levels and fewer systemic adverse effects after the second dose, compared with younger adults. Moreover, Spike-specific Th1 cells in older adults expressed higher levels of PD-1, a negative regulator of T-cell activation, which was associated with low Spike-specific CD8 +T-cell response. These data indicated that delayed induction of CD4 +T-cell response in older adults is linked to impaired humoral and cellular immunity and reduced systemic reactogenicity. Therefore, enhancing CD4 +T-cell response following the first dose is key to improving vaccine efficacy in older adults.
