Vaccine Updates In May 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first two vaccines for prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) for use in adults aged 60 years and older. On June 21, 2023, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that persons aged 60 years and older may receive a single dose of RSV vaccine based on discussions with their healthcare provider about whether RSV vaccination is right for them. Additionally, on August 3, 2023, ACIP recommended nirsevimab for infants aged 8 months and younger during or entering their first RSV season and for infants and children aged 8-19 months who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease entering their second RSV season. The vaccine should be available in the fall. On August 30, 2023, federal guidance was provided on the anticipated FDA authorization/approval and ACIP recommendations for COVID-19 vaccine commercial product (2023-2024 COVID-19 Vaccine). Once FDA approved, product may begin shipping out in the fall. Bridge Access Program - The COVID-19 Vaccine Bridge Access Program is being established to ensure uninsured/underinsured adults will still have access to vaccine once the product is commercialized. The program includes two parts: retail pharmacies and public health (via VFA).
