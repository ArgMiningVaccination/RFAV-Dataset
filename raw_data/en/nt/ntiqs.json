Through its state and city mand ates, the Mental Health Board advises, reviews, advocates, and educates; with the aim of having that advice integrated, incorporated, and reflected in implementation of mental health policy; with the ultimate goal of ensuring quality mental health services. Adopted October 12, 1994 THE MISSION OF THE CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH PLAN The mission of Califo rnia's mental health system shall be to enable persons experiencing severe and disabling mental illnes ses and children with serious emotional disturbances to access services and prog rams that assist them, in a manner tailored to each indi vidual, to better control thei r illness, to achieve their personal goals, and to develo p skills and supports leading to their living the most constructive and satisfying li ves possible in the least re strictive available settings. Passed as part of the Bronzan -McCorquodale Act of 1991 3 A Word From the Chair: What is mental health? Mental health is not just the absence of a mental illness disorder. It is defined as a state of well-be ing in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresse s of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contri bution to her or his community.(1) Yet we find many who are unable or un willing to realize their potential to become contributors to their community. Whether the reasons are because of mental illness or a co-occurring disorder, thousands of San Franciscans face a bleak future without some intervention. San Francisco mental health services are severely short of resources - both human and financial. And without the monies from the \"Mental Health Services Act\" many of San Francisco's \"Community-Based Organizations\" that perform outreach, counseling and mo re \"on the ground\" would have been decimated. Yet is this enough? Of the health care resources available, most are currently spent on the specialized treat ment and care of the people with mental illness, and to a lesser extent on an in tegrated mental health system. And the Governor of California has proposed a $602 million cut to mental health services while on the local level San Francisco wa its patiently in regards to the budget cuts for mental health from the Administrative Branch. The goals and traditions of public health and health promotion can be applied just as usefully in the field of mental health as they have been in the prevention of both infectious and chroni c diseases. Public health agencies can incorporate mental health promotion into chronic disease prevention efforts, conduct surveillance and research to improve the mental health evidence base, and collaborate with partners to develop co mprehensive mental health plans and to enhance coordination of care. The challe nges for public health are to identify risk factors, increase awareness about m ental disorders and the effectiveness of treatment, remove the stigma associat ed with mental disorders and receiving treatment for them, elimi nate health disparities, and improve access to mental health services, particularly among popul ations that are disproportionately affected. (2) We ask that the Mayor of San Franci sco, the Board of Supervisors and the Health Commission take a long hard look at its priorities as a City. Are we working to ensure that \"every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work producti vely and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or hi s community?\" Maintaining the safety-net of community services for San Francisco residents is crucial to correcting the environment, physical and mental health, educ ation, recreation and leisure time, and social belonging of the ci tizens of our fair city.

This new development, called the Richardson Apartments, is a partnership of Mercy Housing and Community Housi ng Partnership. Citywide Case Management will provide onsite supportive services. Richardson Apartments will have 120 studio apartm ents for extremely low income and chronically homeless individuals. Twelve of these studio apartments will house MHSA clients. Construction is estimated to be completed in August 2011. FY 10-11 Annual Plan Approval The FY10-11 Annual Plan Update was approved by both Department of Mental Health on May 26, 2010 and t he Mental Health Oversight and Accountability Commission on May 24, 2010. The FY10-11 Annual Plan Update is required for all components that have had a Three Year Program and Expenditure Plan approved. The budgets are consolidations of new allocations in FY10-11, unapproved prior year funds, and unspent prior year funds. For the San Francisco Plan Update, requests were made for the Community Services and Supports, Wo rkforce Education and Training, and Prevention and Early Intervention com ponents for a total of $25,866,611 to continue with approved projects for thes e three components. With this approval, 75% of the requested amount will be released to San Francisco. Innovation Plan Approval The Innovation Plan, with a budget of $4.M was approved at the May 27th meeting of the Ment al Health Oversight and Acco untability Commission. The 7 Innovation Plan includes 9 that were developed through community planning process which extended for almost a year and vetted by the MHSA Advisory Committee. The focus of these innovative projects is to learn how they could increase access to underserved groups, increase the quality of services including better outcomes, promote in teragency collaborations, and increase access to mental health services. Projects will be im plemented by civil service and contracted programs. Contracted agencies will be selected through a Request for Proposal which will be released in the next fiscal year. The Innovation Projects included in the Plan are: Adapt the Wellness Recovery Action Plan to media that y ouths can identify with; Mindfulness Based Interventions for Youth and thei r Providers; Supported Employment and Cognitive Training; Digital Storytelli ng for Adults; Youth Led Evaluation of Assessment Tools; Peer Education/ Advocacy on the Self-Help Movement and Consumer Rights; Peer Led Hoarding and Cluttering Support Team; Collaboration with the Fait h Based Community; and a Mi ni-Grant project that will fund and encourage creat ive and novel ideas from various communities. Community Behavioral Health Services (CBHS)Highlights The Board of Supervisors maintained t he single standard of care, allowing CBHS to continue to serve indigent clients. CBHS has the Access program that people can call for behavioral health services. On the DPH web site there is a list of community oriented primary care clinics. There are about fourteen such sites. Also there is a consortium of eight-to-ten clinics who participate in Healthy San Francisco. Therapeutic Drumming Practice The Therapeutic Drumming Practice at Instituto Familiar De La Raza (IFR) has been accepted into the SAMHSA National Database of Community Driven Evidence Based Practices. The official acknowledgement and acceptance of Community Defined Evidenc e Practices by National Institutes is a shift in policy that resonates with the vision of San Francisco, DPH, IFR, and our Communities at large; and em powers the voices of our diverse people. SFDPH supports their efforts for being visionaries and leaders in promoting culturally appropriate practices throughout San Francisco. Nonprofits Join Forces on 990 Polk Affordable Housing Finance magazine has named 990 Polk Street, where formerly homeless and low-income seni ors are integrated under one roof at 990 Polk Street, as one of two finalists in its senior housing category for its Reader's Choice Award for the Na tion's Best Affordable Housing Developments. This is a national com petition, with entries from 140 projects in 20 states, with selection based among other things on community impact and overall role in community revitalization. SAMHSA TCE Grant Awarded to CBHS 8 Community Behavioral Health Services (CBHS ) was awarded the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Targeted Capacity Expansion grant for Substance Abuse Treatm ent and HIV/AIDS services. Southeast Health Opportuni ties Project (SHOP) is a service expansion and enhancement pr oject that will serve t he predominately African American residents of San Francisco's Bayview Hunters Point (BVHP), Potrero Hill, and Sunnydale neighborhoods impacted by substance use and abuse and HIV/ AIDS. The San Francisco Department of Public Health's Community Behavioral Health Services (CBHS) and its partners will implement this project. These partners will include contract agencies, affiliated community-based organizat ions, and stakeholder groups. The program will focus on low-income indi viduals who use or abuse illegal substances, engage in high-risk sexual behaviors, are involved in the criminal justice system and are in need of comprehen sive treatment services. At least 300 people will be served annually. The cont ract award is in the total amount of $2,250,000 ($450,000/yr * 5yrs). Budget Cuts The City-wide deficit for 2010 - 2011 is $500 millions, and a $102 million shortfall in the General Fund for the Department of Publ ic Health (DPH). Mid year cuts were applied. The biggest im pact to CBHS was the closure of two substance abuse residential programs. There were other reductions based on lower contract usage and some savings fr om the Mental Health Services Act funds. All together, DPH had over $7 Million in mid-year cuts as discussed at the Health Commission in December, 2009. The San Francisco model of care is an inverted pyramid with the most expensive services at t he bottom and prevention at t he top. Thirty years ago we had 300 beds at Napa State Hospit al and we now have only 41 beds. People were discharged however, before community services were available. There was also an explosion of access to street drugs at that time. Napa costs $175,000 per year per person for long term care. In-patient adult psychiatry did not generat e revenue for the City. The City has lost psychiatric beds at St. Mary Hospital, St. Luke Hospital and San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) when these institutions went through down sizing. They tried to work with Un iversity of California of San Francisco hospital (UCSF) but UCSF does not take people with Medicare. The City still has a few beds with San Francisco Gener al Hospital and at St. Francis Hospital, up to 36 beds. UCSF cannot accept Medicare. They have 42 beds. At St. Mary's Hospital, t here is a small adolescent psychiatric unit. There are some people at California Pacific Hospital but it is expensive because the City doesn't have a contract wit h them because they will not abide by the City's Sunshine Laws. 9 The Dore Urgent Care Center is an alte rnative to the Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES). Dore is able to receive people who are 5150'd but cannot hold people involuntarily. There are roughly fifty-two beds at Acute Diversion Units where patients can get about two weeks of care. Day treatment for adults has been repl aced with the wellness recovery and socialization progr am because this program is more cost efficient. The Mental Health Plan was originally designed for MediCal clients. That is why the Alameda County only takes MediCal clients and turns away indigents. But San Francisco uses general fund to contract out mental health services to providers who can provide the best services regardless of the person's MediCal status. Another thing San Francisco is doing is the integration of mental health with primary care. The placement team aut horizes the levels of care based on various criteria that sometimes sh ift people outside of San Francisco to places like Crestwood Manors which is operated by the Crestwood Behavioral Incorporated. It has places in San Jose, Vallejo, Novato , and Fremont . The cost of real-estate property in S an Francisco is still very high which prohibits building any new long-term ca re facilities. Utilizing out-of-county services, sometimes, is the only option. One of the reasons CBHS is trying to reduce long-term out of c ounty beds is because it is expensive and hard on families. It would be good to have mo re access to safe housing and case management. The average length of stay at places like St. Francis is about seven days and SFGH is about eleven days. With m odern medications, people with mental illness can be stabilized in about five days. The Mayor handed his budget recommendations to the Board of Supervisors on June 1, 2010. Many proposed cuts to residential programs, children's mental health services, and methadone we re restored. Significant cuts, however, remain mainly in outpatient mental health and substance abuse services as well as vocational services. San Francisco Library Hires Social Worker For Homeless DPH set up a program operating out of the Main Library that provides a social worker to interact with the many homel ess individuals who use the library as a safe, dry and secure place to spend the day. This particular item caught the attention of Chronicle reporter Heather Knight, whose fe ature story on the program was subsequently picked up by other journalists, talk radio shows and internet bloggers. The most recent story about the pr ogram was written by Evelyn Nieves, former writer for the New York Times and currently on assignment with the AP. Ms. Nieves' ar ticle and photos appeared in the over 200 publications throughout the US. 10 Mega RFP The awards for the Mega Request for Proposal (RFP) were released but the appeal process has not been completed so the programs will not be listed in this Annual Report. Two-thirds of the f unding for CBHS services were sent out to bid. Transitions at CBHS As of July 1, 2010, CBHS will be a part of a bigger Community Health Program and not independent of primary care. The Director of CBHS and the Designated Mental Health Administrator for San Francisco after July 1, 2010, will be Jo Robinson, MTF, currently Direc tor of San Francisco Jail Psychiatric Services. Bob Cabaj, MD, will become t he Medical Director for CBHS. Dr. Aaron Chapman who has been the Medica l Director for over five years will remain with DPH working more dire ctly with primary care clinics. EQRO Summary EQRO will supply an official report as a resu lt of their visit, but in the mean time, what follows is a summary of their closing remarks. Focus groups : The reviewers noted that there were many new participants, especially consumers who star ted services within the last 6 months. Reviewers were impressed that most consumers felt that reported that individual therapy, case management, and medication services were readily available to them. API focus group : Consumers reported mostly being satisfied with services. They especially liked the structure (vocational supports and wellness center) of day treatment, but miss that structure when they step down to socialization. TBS focus group : Reviewers met with biological mothers who reported that the experienced mental health, substance abuse, as well as socio economic issues. They were pleased with services, but wish that they could have had these services before their children were removed from the home. Consumer Employee focus group : The reviewers were pleased with the support group and liked the recent change of opening that group to a larger group. However, they felt that job opportunities available to them did not provide a career ladder. Assessment of CBHS : The reviewers recognized that strides have been made to improve communication between CBHS and providers. CBHS was commended for outstanding service delivery in that SF provides more services per client when compared to other large counties. They note significant strides in Foster Care penetration rate s. They voiced one concern that among 11 Latinos who are Medi-Cal el igible, the percentage of th ose seeking services is lower than expected. CBHS was commended for its sophisticated use of data in decision making. Specifically, they mention the good use of data wit hin the Foster Care system, the HUMS system, and the analysis of Adv anced Access. However, they noted that line staff are not always aware of, or do not recall seeing data on a regular basis. Regarding the implementation of Avatar, the reviewers were impressed with our standardization of the use of CANS and ANSA. They felt that time spent in various workgroups was \"time well spent \" and that decision making structure leant itself to increasing user buy-in. They felt that conversion strategy of immediate (as opposed to gradual) conversion from BIS would minimize confusion. However, they expressed concerns about how the implementation of Phase II would affect the amount of denied claims. Finally, the reviewers evaluated our Pe rformance Improvem ent Projects to ensure that they meet specific docum entation requirements. They will provide additional details in th eir final written report.

FY 09-10 has been a year of growth for GABHS for Gals , and though budget cuts have threatened our work, we are proud to say that GABHS has flexed and adapted to accommodate the changes throughout Community Behaviora l Health Services (CBHS). This report will detail GABHS for Gal's work ov er the past year, the needs of women and girls in CBHS, and the gaps in services for women and girls. Just a reminder...What is GABHS for Gals? GABHS for Gals is a nickname fo r the full title of the group: Gender Appropriate and Culturally Competent Behavioral H ealth Services for Women, Girls, and Families. We are a group of clinicians, manager s, civil servants, mental health workers, health educators, administr ators, and consumer s. Our members represent a coalition of diverse organi zations serving populations throughout San Francisco, all committed to advocating for gender and culturally appropriate services for women, girls, and familie s in San Francisco's behavioral health system. Started in June 2008, GABHS for Gals has held monthly policy advocacy meetings, inviting group participation in order to work for change to support the needs of women, girls, and families. Currently, due to budget cuts throughout San Francisco that have resulted in mem bers either losing their jobs or having minimal extra time to attend meetings, GABHS for Ga ls holds bi-monthly policy meetings and has increased email comm unication and participation. The group operates on two parallel tracks to suppor t women, girls, and families throughout San Francisco: a macro-level track, focusing on systems and policy change, and a micro-level track, committ ed to supporting clinicians w ho provide direct service to women, girls, and families. Just a reminder...What are \"Gender A ppropriate and Culturally Competent Services?\" Gender Appropriate and Culturally Competent Behavioral Health Services is the umbrella term used to descri be behavioral health services that both consider and meet the unique needs of women, men, girls, bo ys, transgender people, and families from all different cultures. Providers are encouraged to consider the complex interactions between biological, social, psychosocial, family, language, and cultural factors when serving each indi vidual. These services may or may not include gender and/or cu ltural specific services, where services are targeted to 14 only one gender or culture. A neutral approach, where the same services are provided to everyone without regard for gen der and culture, neglects the crucial impact of gender and culture on client needs. All health services should be both gender appropriate and culturally competent. An assessment or treatment plan should consider an individ ual's unique gender needs alongside his or her cultural and l anguage needs. Clinicians should feel comfortable assessing for these needs. To provide the most comprehensive, holistic treatment, provider s should encourage their sta ff to seek training on gender topics, culture, langu age, and ethnicity topics, and their interconnections. San Francisco's Department of Health Community Programs (and specifically Community Behavioral Health Services) will continue to bring varied training opportunities for gender, diversity, and cu ltural awareness to its providers. The Continued Need for Gender Appr opriate and Culturally Competent Services within San Francisco's Behavioral Health System: Unfortunately, San Francisco's Community Behavioral Health System still is not fully addressing the needs of women, girls, and families. Though GABHS for Gals has been hard at work, ultimately, system change must also be supported from upper-CBHS leadership. Right now, budget cuts have decimated behavioral health services throughout San Francisco, and programs traditionally strong in serving women, girls, and familie s have suffered, such as Iris Center, Sage, Horizons Unlimited Girls Progr am, Citywide Forensic Case Management, Women's Program at Jail Psychiatric Serv ices, Ella Hill Hutch Shelter, Marion's Shelter, la Raza Girls' Drumming group, Edgewood Girls' Shelter and more. Without adequate funding, women, girls, and families always lose as less-intensive inpatient serv ices, outpatient services, and community based services are often the first to be cut. One prime example that CB HS has not fully addressing the needs of women, girls and families is evidenced by the fact that CBHS has not yet implemented language changes in official policy documentati on or in procedural shifts to reflect a commitment to gender appropriate and responsive services. Research conducted during the last ten years fr om leading public health and behavioral health institutions throughout the state, the nation, and the world, emphasize the unique needs of women and girls, including the World Health Organization (http://www.who.int/mental_health/resources/gender/en/ ), US Department of Health and and SAMSHA ( http://womenandchildren.treat ment.org/more.asp?id=14 ). of work has summarized the impor tance and effectiveness of gender- responsive services, similar to gender appropriate services in providing appropriate treatment fo r women and girls (see www.nicic.org , \"Gender- Responsive Strategies for Research, Prac tice, and Guiding Principles for Women Offenders\" by Bloom, Owen, and Covingt on, 2003, for a succinct summary of research on this topic). Several groups have even adopted a set of \"Core Competencies for Work with Women and Girls\" that emphasizes gender- 15 responsive treatment and gives concrete guidelines for systems make their services more gender appropriate, including SAMSHA (http://womenandchildren.treatment.org/more.asp?id=14 ) and California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs (http://www.adp.ca.gov/Perinatal /pdf/Core_Competencies_Wm_Tx.pdf ). However, though the San Francisco Ment al Health Board and GABHS for Gals have advocated for action towards these goals over the past two years, CBHS has not fully embraced this effort and has not taken enough steps to create the necessary system shift. The results of th is inaction are readily available. For example, the Cultural Competency Department collects demographic, salary, ethnicity, and language capacity data ever y year from every civil servant and staff person working at a CBHS contact agency; however, last year, an employee noted that gender has never been collected, resulting in the inability to analyze these data points by gender (thanks to this employee's efforts, gender has been collected for the first time this year). Al so, trainers at CBHS trainings may make generalizations that their pr esentation applies to all clie nts, but then are unable to address questions about whether the research that suppor ts this presentation is has been conducted on both men and women, the sample size, the age of participants, the ethnicity of participants, socio-economic status of research sample, and whether the research has been conducted in ways that have taken gender and culture into account. Similarly, clinicians at GABHS for Gals meetings report that female clients have been emotionally, sexually or physically harassed by other clients due to gender while in CBHS programs (including s helters, food lines, transitional housing facilities, Single Room Occupancy hot els(SROs), inpatient, and outpatient settings), resulting in a feelings of low perceived safety, and thus a lack of rapport with clinicians and staff, low penetration and retention rates, and lower outcomes with women and girls. Clinicians report that they do not have enough resources and training opportunities to engage with clients around issues that particularly affect women, including trauma, body image, violence, self-esteem, hormonal cycles, pre and post-natal health, reproductive health issues, and cannot offer their clients basic supplem ental services such as childcare, transportation to and from services, serv ices in their first language, health education, and a central information source on women, girls, and family-centered services throughout San Francisco. Clearly, CBHS has a long way to go in establishing gender appropriate and culturally competent services for all clients. GABHS for Gals has attempted to address some of these gaps in our work over the past year. What We Have Accomplished During FY09-10: A Language Shift to \"Gender Appropria te and Culturally Competent\" and \"Women, Girls, and Families.\" Over the past year, the group decided that we 16 needed to include the terms \"cultural compet ence\" and \"Families\" in the title of GABHS for Gals, as well as use these terms more prominently in the group's literature. As discussions deepened, the group wanted to indicate more clearly their commitment to consider gender and cu lture as two parts of the same whole, that gender and culture are always in tertwined and must be conceptualized as such. Similarly, the group chose to em phasize that women and girls exist in contexts that almost always include fa milies, and that family-centered services are an important aspect of supporting wom en and girls. By adding in the terms \"cultural competence\" and \"families\" to the GABHS title and by using it throughout definitions, flyers, policy di scussion, and more, the group hopes to indicate that behavioral health services must be gender appropr iate, culturally competent, and family-centered, that you cannot have one without the other two, and that treating a client holistically requi res considering these as essential and interconnecting factors in an individual's wellbeing. Currently, CBHS literature typically includes only the term \"c ultural competence\" and not \"gender appropriate\" as well; also, families ar e not always mentioned when discussing women and girls' services. We hope CB HS will begin to adopt language that includes gender appropriate, culturally-competent, and family-centered services as a goal for the entire city of San Francisco. (Please see our updated Mission, Goals, and Definition Statement for more information.) Macro Level Work Ongoing Needs Assessment of Women a nd Girls in Behavioral Health Programs in Diverse Communities throughout San Francisco. In order to assess the unmet needs of women, girls, and families in San Francisco, GABHS for Gals and the San Francisco Ment al Health Board have been conducting on ongoing needs assessment of women and girl s in behavioral health programs in diverse communities in San Francisco. The goal of these Needs Assessments is to develop a more nuanced understanding of what it means to provide gender appropriate and culturally competent behavioral health services for different communities throughout San Francisco. GABHS for Gals is curious to learn from local experts about the demographics of the women and girls in these communities, what is working when pr oviding behavioral health services, and what are the needs of women, girls, and families being served in this community. Ultimately, GABHS for Gals will create a comprehensive Needs Assessment of Women, Girls, and Families in San Francisco that will be used to raise awareness and support for women, girls, and fa milies, and to assist local efforts to raise funds for women, girls, and family services. In Summer 2008, Sarah Accomazzo, Special Projects Manager for GABHS for Gals, conducted the first Needs Assessmen t. She visited twenty-five programs throughout San Francisco, but mostly focu sing on programs in the Civic Center and Tenderloin area. Themes that emerged from this needs assessment included issues of safety, tr auma, body image, and language needs. Interviewees stressed a lack of a comprehensive, centralized listing of behavioral 17 health resources and services for women, girls, and families and a lack of evidence-based practices that focus on gender issues. Also, participants highlighted the need for more services for transgender folks, sex workers, and undocumented immigrants. In October 2009, Erika Carlsen, CORO Fellow for the Mental Health Board, conducted a Needs Assessment of women, girls, and family behavioral health services in the Bayview/Hunters' Point/Visitacion Valley area, vi siting twenty-four programs. Themes as to what is work ing included an ability to build trust and relationship with clients, offer services in different languages, provide culturally- competent, community-based, grassroots services, provid e stability, foster self- esteem, unconditional care models, and peer mentorship. Themes around needs included services to address PTSD, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, depression, violence in the home and communi ty, children in foster care, healthy relationships, the division of families, and stigma surrounding mental health services. Participants requested child-care and safe space for families to interact while in services and stressed the need fo r culturally specific and culturally competent mental health serv ices that also address stigma surrounding mental health. Currently ongoing in June and July 2010, Sa ndra Saucedo, Mental Health Board Intern and PsyD Candidate at Alliant University, is conducting a needs assessment of women, girls, and familie s in San Francisco's Mission District. We eagerly await her findings. Safety in Community Behavioral Health Programs - Policy Brief and Program Checklist. For the 2009-2010 fiscal year, G ABHS for Gals identified Safety in Community Behavioral Health Pr ograms as a macro-level priority. This priority came about after several group me mbers told stories of female clients who had felt unsafe in thei r neighborhood, housing, or even at the behavioral health agency, due to physical, em otional, and sexual harassment; group members wondered if these safety concerns seemed to result in lower service penetration rates, lower retention rate s, and a reduction in positive behavioral health outcomes for female c lients. Unfortunately, me mbers often felt powerless to help their clients in these situations , stating that they lacked resources and strategies to increase the safety of their c lients. Thus, over the course of several meetings, the group created a Checklist for Safety in Community Behavioral Health Programs, to be used by administr ators, managers, staff, and clinicians, to raise awareness and increase safety for clients at programs. Also, based on the group's discussions, Sarah wrote a policy brief entitled \"Making Your Program More Gender Appropriate: Addre ssing Safety in Community Behavioral Health Programs,\" currently in press wit h the California Women's Mental Health Policy Council. The brief and checklist will be distributed statewide by the CWMHPC and locally by GABHS for Gal within the next few months. 18 GABHS for Gals First Annual Survey: What Can We Do For You This Year? In January 2010, GABHS for Gals sent out a first annual survey to its mailing list. The survey was an attempt to solicit feedback and input on how GABHS for Gals could better support people working with women and girls throughout San Francisco. We received 40 responses and collected both quantitative and qualitative data. Out of four teen possible priorities on a 1-4 scale, five priorities received a score higher than 3: \"e vidence-based practices that are gender and culturally appropriate,\" \"Best practice s for working with women, girls, and families,\" \"intake and assessment stra tegies that are gender appropriate,\" on behavioral health and gender issues,\" \"trauma and gender.\" Body Image/Eating Disorders also received a high rating. Respondents indicated that they were most likely to attend short trai nings focused on specific topics over the lunch hour or day-long trainings as opposed to monthly policy meetings, meetings after work, etc. In qualitativ e comments, respondents indicated that women, girls, and families are very impor tant issues, but t hat the current budget crisis has made attending monthly policy meetings unfeasible. This survey was immensely valuable in establishing GABH S' priorities for the year, and GABHS intends to send out an annual survey each upcoming year to continue to solicit this important input and feedback. Micro Level Track Women and Girls Hot Topics Seminar Series. In March 2010, GABHS for Gals kicked off a \"Women and Girls Hot Topics Semi nar Series.\" This series is a direct response to feedback received in the First Annual GABHS Survey and also from participants in CBHS' 2009 Women's Heal th Conference, asking for more trainings specifically on women and girls' topics, with a diverse set of trainers who deliver specifics about how to work with diverse clients in San Francisco. Thus, GABHS' monthly brown bag lunch workshop series focuses on best practices for working with women and girl s in San Francisco, always with an eye to cultural contexts, and features \"local experts,\" or trainers who work in San Francisco and provide case examples fr om a diverse clientele base in San Francisco. Thus far, the series has completed a three part module on body image and continues throughout the summer with a three-part module on trauma, both issues that were identified in t he survey and at the conference as needing more attention. The workshops hav e been well-attended (and attendance is growing!), and participants have often aske d for more time for each of these important topics.

Marcella Raimondo, MPH, will be leading the training and the San Francisco Public Health Institute will be offering CEUs for providers. Please keep an eye out for a Save the Date card in the next few weeks. 20 MENTAL HEALTH BOARD PRIORITI ES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS 2009-10 \u0083 Goal #1 : Further investigate mental health services and advocate for increased funds in the Southeast sector, and present findings to relevant stakeholders and policymakers for the City and County of San Francisco. Community Wellness Partners continued to meet and strategize the development of more funding connections with CBHS . One of the programs developed a collaboration with a downtown non-profit, however, funding cuts may keep that program from being funded. \u0083 Goal #2: Outreach to community organiza tions such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) , In Your Own Voice, to youth organizations, the media, newsp apers, and blogs. Attend community meetings. Outreach to encourage people to seek mental health careers and participate in the Workforce, Development and Education Plan. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and the SF Mental Health Board sponsored a joint hearing in February 2010 to present mental health concerns and issues to the community. The hearing was held in the Board of Supervisors Chambers and it was attended by more than 50 people. The meeting was televised and played on public television many times. \u0083 Goal #3 : Investigate elderly issues like suicide prevention, socio-economic concerns, general safety, timely access to medical services and advocate for mental health services for the elderly. The Board receives regular updates from Dr. Cabai regarding issues concerning older adults. The board also heard from Dr. Katz about the integration of mental health and primary care which would affect the elderly. In addition the Board had a presentation about s eniors and depression. \u0083 Goal #4 : Investigate mental health issues for veterans, including women veterans, through research and communications to advocate and collaborate with curre nt stakeholders. Mental Health Board Projects Police Crisis Intervention Training The Mental Health Board continued to provide the Police Crisis Intervention training initiated and facilitat ed by the MHB. Officers rate the training as very 21 effective and many have stated that it is the best training they have ever received. Since May 2001, Community B ehavioral Health Services (CBHS) and the San Francisco Police Department (SFPD) have been offering the Police Crisis Intervention Training (PCIT) to police officers. The goal of this training is to educate officers about mental illness and pr ovide them with new skills and tools to use when interacting with the mentally ill. In June 2010, we finished the 34th PCIT, and to date nearly 1000 officers have received training. Many Mental Health Board members have participated on the consumer/family member panel and in the role-playing sessions of the tr aining. Sadly, the police department has decided to bring the training into the Po lice Academy so the Mental Health Board will no longer be involved in the training. Southeast Sector of San Francisco The board has continued to staff meetings in Visita cion Valley and provide a bridge of information to the community. A few collaborations were developed between programs in the Bayview and Visita cion Valley, but it looks like at the time of the printing of this annual report, t hat budget cuts may eliminate that funding. CBHS still seems disinclined to fund programs by providers in the Southeast Sector. Unfortunately little pr ogress has been made over the past year to increase funding for these programs. Mo st clients in the Southeast Sector must still travel to other parts of the ci ty for services that are potentially less culturally sensitive to their needs. Staff Projects The administrator serves on the Department of Public Health (DPH) Community Programs Disaster Planning Team in S an Francisco and the Bay Area. The team started in meeting in April 2010. In the Fall of 2009, DPH requested volunt eers the H1N1 Swine Flu Vaccination and the administrator va ccinated people for the H1N1 Swine Flu Vaccination Clinic at Potrero Hill Clinic and at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. 22 THE MENTAL HEALTH BOARD \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.\" \u2014Margaret Mead Each of California's 58 counties oper ates a public mental health system. Under state law each of these systems must have the input of citizen advisors in the form of an official Mental Health Board. Each county may tailor its Board to meet local needs. In San Francisco, our Board has 17 members. Each of our 11 Supervisors makes an individual appointment and the remainin g 6 seats are appointed by the full Board, through the Rules Committee. The categories of membership are as follows: 5 Consumer Seats 6 Family Member Seats 3 Public Interest Seats 2 Mental Health Professional Seats 1 Member of the Board of Supervisors The Board provides advice on progr am development, budget prioritization, policy, and strategic planning. The 4 ke y duties of the Board members are: 1. Attend the monthly Ment al Health Board meeting. This is where resolutions are discussed, debated, and decided. Many of the issues are complicated ones, requiri ng a great deal of background reading and discussion in preparation for a vote. 2. Serve on an MHB Committee. Each member serves on one MHB Committ ee, attends its monthly meeting, and participates fully in its work. Committees develop recommendations to send to the full Board. They also pl an and carry out special site visits, projects, and events. 3. Conduct Program Reviews Each member of the MHB must do at least one program review per year. We go out to a mental health program and interview the clients about what's working in the program and what needs to be improved. 4. Attend the Annual Retreat Once a year, the Board meets all day on a Saturday, which counts as the Board meeting for that month. The purpose of our retreat is to take some time out to pay attention to the larger questions of mission and purpose and to develop our vision and priorities for the coming year. 23 MENTAL HEALTH BOARD MEMBERS CHAIR James Shaye Keys Seat #3 Public Interest Appointee of Supervisor Chris Daly James is currently the Office Manager and Admin Supervisor for the MSSP/Linkages Program of the Institute on Aging, and he is a well know advocate for mental health services in San Francisco.
