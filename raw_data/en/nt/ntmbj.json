This may be achieved through live Question & Answer Sessions, live study group activity with tutor/instructor involvement, face-to-face in classroom teaching, or clinic time. For online and correspondence schools, this can be achieved via webinar or teleconference with live interaction each month. AIA currently approved Level 3 Schools will be required to have 20 direct hours of live education/interaction by 2018 and the full 40 direct hours of live education/interaction incorporated into their program by 2019. This may be achieved through live Question & Answer Sessions, live study group activity with tutor/instructor involvement, face-to-face in classroom teaching, or clinic time. For online and correspondence schools, this can be achieved via webinar or teleconference with live interaction. The plan to incorporate the live education/interaction requirement must be included in the renewal packet. This new requirement will provide a better opportunity for the school staff to better assess the student's competency in working their cases and essential oil use. This effort will help to ensure the student's understanding of the theory and proficiency in the practice of Aromatherapy. Students entering an aromatherapy program with a degree/license in health related fields (e.g. Nurses, Massage therapists, Doctors) may test out or be exempt from the anatomy and physiology section only in relation to that part of the training which goes over the structure and function of each system. These health professionals are still required to complete training in the application of essential oils to each system and the effect of essential oils on a variety of common ailments. Any exemption of the anatomy and physiology portion of training should only be allowed when the request for exemption is fully supported by relevant documentation. Special Note for Clinical Level Schools (300-399 hours) The AIA recognizes that there are Advanced Practice Level schools that offer Aromatherapy training to only existing health professionals. A prerequisite to attend such a school requires a previous license in a health related field. The schools' curriculum may not meet the AIA Level 3 Guidelines as written, as consideration is given for previous general training in the areas of anatomy, physiology, chemistry and pathology. These schools provide for specific training in these areas as it directly relates to Aromatherapy, and may also provide for a review of other areas of previous training. As such, the total curriculum hours for these schools may fall in the 300-399 range. AIA Recognized Advanced Practice Level Schools that fall into this category, may grant qualified students advanced placement credit (50 hours for licensed massage therapists, 100 nurses and doctors-restrictions apply*) to bring the student to the required 400 hours of study. The school may require a separate exam upon enrolment to ensure the student meets any prerequisite necessary for enrollment. Students entering an aromatherapy program with a degree/license in health related fields (e.g. Nurses, Massage Therapists, Doctors) may test out or be exempt from the anatomy and physiology section only in relation to that part of the training which goes over the structure and function of each system. Pre-existing health professionals are still required to complete training in the application of essential oils to each system and the effect of essential oils on a variety of common ailments. *Student must have been working in their professional capacity (doctor, nurse, massage therapist) within the last 10 years.
