So, if you're someone whose resolve might be wavering, stay strong - you won't regret it. It's hard, we know - and no one is saying don't treat yourself. However, if aim is to [stick to your health kick](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/how-to-boost-naturally-immune-system-best-foods-winter-2022/) for the rest of the year, [eat clean and get into shape](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/how-keep-heart-healthy-prevent-disease-diet-exercise-2022/), we want to support you in sticking to that goal. Although it can be hard to [commit to clean eating](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/herbs-spices-reduce-blood-pressure-heart-disease-use-meals-diet-2022/) when it is slightly colder - but we're moving closer to spring, sunnier days and warmer weather every day. If you can [keep up your healthy eating plan](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/healthy-diet-avoid-processed-food-best-swaps-health-uk-2022/), you might just find that both your mind and body will thank you for it. According to Sophie Dillon, nutritionist at [Fresh Fitness Food](https://www.freshfitnessfood.com/), creating an eating plan of balanced meals - packed full of both nutrition and taste, is the best way to stick to your clean eating health kick. She recommends swapping processed and packaged foods for whole food ingredients. \"We aim to minimise saturated fat, salt and sugar intake and processed foods can contribute heavily to this. Focussing on whole food ingredients will ensure we are providing ourselves with the nutrients we require for a healthy, balanced diet.\" So, before you abandon your healthy eating and [working out regime](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/how-get-fit-40s-best-exercises-fitness-workouts-2022/) and reach for the biscuit tin, take a look at the benefits achieved by [forgoing alcohol](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/how-to-adopt-mindful-drinking-limit-alcohol-consumption-less-2022/), sugar, meat and empty carbs. We asked the experts what measurable effects might be seen in just 10 days. Why stick to clean eating in 2022 Alcohol No hangovers, more energy, a brighter complexion; one week alcohol-free and you might already be feeling more jolly than you ever did after a glass of wine. \"A couple of alcohol-free weeks also help show us that we can function and manage without alcohol and are not using it as a crutch or turning to it in times of anxiety, stress or to unwind,\" says Professor Curt Ellison from The International Scientific Forum on Alcohol Research. [For the first few days of being teetotal, you might have wondered why you felt so moody](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/nutrition/diet/three-easy-ways-stay-dry-january/). Alcohol creates a complex imbalance of dopamine, released when we engage in pleasurable activities, in the brain. Alcohol use overloads the brain with dopamine, while also reducing the brain's dopamine receptors in the process. When you first quit drinking, the lack of dopamine and diminished receptors can lead to feelings of sadness and hopelessness. Four days in, however, and your body's systems will have adjusted. You may find you have better concentration and energy. Sleep might be a little harder at first without alcohol's soporific effects; even if booze is bad for deep sleep. But after 10 days, says Professor David Nutt, author of Drink? The New Science of Alcohol and Your Health, \"your sleep will be of a better quality and you'll feel more refreshed in the morning\". Dreams may also be more vivid without alcohol suppressing the REM stage of sleep. [The physical consequences of heavy alcohol use](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/how-alcohol-affects-body-age-40-should-stop-drinking/), such as liver damage and high blood pressure, are well known. But can there be any impact on those areas after just ten days of abstinence? \"Yes,\" says Dr Nutt. \"Ten days of freedom from alcohol will restore the liver back to normal and will also remove the effects of alcohol on the heart and blood pressure.\" But, he warns, quitting alcohol will also undo any tolerance to alcohol in your brain. \"So you will get more effect from the same dose when you restart - which means be careful once you restart not to accidentally overdo it.\" Sugar Going on a sugar detox might initially cause you to suffer withdrawal symptoms. \"Sugar stimulates the brain's reward system, leading you to eat more of that sugary food,\" explains nutritionist Rob Hobson. Research has found the most common foods associated with addictive symptoms are those high in added fats or added/refined sugars. \"Some people may face certain physical or emotional symptoms when abstaining from refined sugar. Most of us will not face any symptoms, but studies have shown symptoms could include fatigue, low mood and alterations in concentration levels when cutting refined sugar.\" These are just short-term effects, which are outweighed by [the long-term impact on overall health from cutting out or down on refined sugars;](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/nutrition/diet/how-eat-less-sugar-midlife-easy-ways-cut-down-2021/) from weight loss to better gut health. Cutting sugar out of your diet may help to boost energy levels and improve your ability to focus, says Hobson. He is working with British Apples and Pears on their 'Healthy Body' campaign, and points out that natural sugars found in fruit and vegetables are beneficial in our diets, as our bodies metabolise fruit sugar differently than processed or added sugars. \"The low glycaemic index and glycaemic load in apples means they are a source of slow-release energy, making them an excellent snack choice for people with insulin resistance and diabetes, who need to carefully control their blood glucose levels,\" says Hobson. \"Refined and added sugars, on the other hand, may lead to a higher risk of health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease.\" Meat Obviously, it depends on how much you used to eat before giving it up, but for [the first 10 days of going meatless](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/nutrition/diet/three-easy-ways-eat-less-meat/), you may still feel hungry after your main meal. This is because psychologically you're accustomed to eating meat and a small side of vegetables at most meals. Some vegan diets may be lower in fat and protein, and the unsatisfied feeling may be related to that, too. Although, for Rachel Ama, vegan recipe creator and author of One Pot: Three Ways, she felt a lot lighter and more energised within 10 days of making the decision to go vegan. \"After meals I felt full, but never heavy and sluggish, which I realised I used to feel after eating meat. I really hadn't noticed that happened until I went plant-based.\" Your taste buds will also change, as zinc, found in oysters, beef and crab, helps to boost tastebuds. Fortified cereals, yoghurt, cashews and oatmeal are some of the vegetarian-friendly foods that can help up your zinc intake. What will also improve is your gut health. [The dietary fibre in vegetables, fruits and wholegrains help your body maintain a healthy intestinal microbiome](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/features/fibre-diet-best-foods-what-eat-healthy-gut-2021/) by contributing to the growth of \"friendly\" bacteria. When you first start adding more plant-based foods to your diet, you may feel like you're going to the loo more than usual. But if you're going once a day, you're actually becoming more regular. \"One reason why it can be difficult to keep up a healthy habit at the beginning is because positive changes are unlikely to be noticeable for a few weeks,\" says James Collier, registered nutritionist, co-founder and head of sustainable nutrition at leading nutritionally complete food brand, Huel (uk.huel.com). \"Don't let this get you down. If you're on the right track, making small changes will lead to bigger results over time. Patience combined with determination will get you a long way.\" You may notice some weight loss; studies show that people who stick with a vegetarian diet consume less fatty food, and are thinner than people who eat meat. Ten days is too soon to know, but there's evidence that the world's longest-living people are found in plant-based diet communities. Exercise There are no quick fixes and shortcuts to a fitter body, but after 10 days of taking up exercise, Dean Hodgkin, personal trainer and head of programming at leading community wellness and fitness app [Truconnect by tv.fit](https://truconnect.fit) says strength can improve. \"Although this is as a result of neurological adaptations rather than muscle gains. The individual motor units within your muscles quickly learn to work in synchronicity, resulting in the muscle fibres generating more force.\" Recent research suggests just a single bout of exercise can positively impact your mood status. After 10 days you will have reduced your stress levels, helping to lower the risk of slipping into depression. \"As soon as you begin working out, blood flow to your brain will increase, helping your brain cells to function more efficiently. It's common to feel more alert during exercise and more focused afterwards.\" It's no secret that some forms of exercise, such as [high intensity interval training (HIIT), can be somewhat uncomfortable](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/hiit-misswhy-really-can-get-much-good-thing/). \"As a response your brain immediately releases endorphins,\" explains Hodgkin. \"A source of euphoria that will not only numb the pain but also boost your mental fortitude so you'll push harder, ensuring you achieve the results you desire.\" After only a few cardio workouts, you'll feel fitter and have more energy due to a rapid increase in the enzyme mitochondria within the muscle cells. \"It is known as the power generator so you will quickly become more efficient at producing energy, meaning exercise will become easier in future.\" This article is kept updated with the latest advice.
