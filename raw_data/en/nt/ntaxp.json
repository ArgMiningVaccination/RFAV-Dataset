If you're frequently exposed to air pollution, have recently quit smoking or would simply like to promote good respiratory health, you may be wondering how you can clean your lungs naturally. Cleansing your lungs is surprisingly easy\u2014there are several self-care measures and lifestyle changes that can help facilitate the lungs' self-cleaning process and clear out everyday toxins. Lung Cleansing Techniques Pulmonary health plays a critical role in your overall health. To ensure you can feel your best, give these lung cleansing techniques a try: Do Steam Therapy Breathe in, breathe out. Inhaling steam from a hot shower or boiling pot of water can open the airways and help loosen and clear mucus from the lungs. Breathing in steam may also provide temporary relief to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients who experience labored breathing. Drink Green Tea Cleaning your lungs may be as simple as sipping hot tea\u2014green tea, specifically. Green tea is packed with inflammation-reducing antioxidants, and some research suggests that it may help protect lung tissue from the harmful impacts of smoke inhalation. Invest in an Air Purifier One way to clean your lungs is to first clean the air you breathe. And while you can't regulate outdoor air pollution, you can control the air in your own home. Consider purchasing an air purifier\u2014either a whole-home system or a small device for individual rooms\u2014to create a healthier indoor environment. You may also want to nix air fresheners with harsh, artificial scents that can irritate your lungs. Exercise Regularly Regularly engaging in low-impact exercise (particularly aerobic activities like cycling, swimming and dancing) can help improve lung capacity, increase oxygen levels and provide countless other health benefits. If you have a lung condition such as COPD or asthma, be sure to speak with a medical professional before starting a new exercise routine. Eat Anti-Inflammatory Foods Inflamed airways can result in labored breathing and an uncomfortable, heavy feeling in the chest.
