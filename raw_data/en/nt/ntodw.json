Unlike the cases that we often present, these were individuals who could have died within a matter of days due to hospital-acquired pneumonia, despite aggressive conventional treatment. Homeopathy acted almost immediately and undeniably in both cases. Both patients were discharged, to the surprise of family and hospital staff, two to four days later. This was not the apparent course prior to homeopathic intervention. R.C. R.C., age 72, was admitted to a prominent university hospital for colon resection following a decades-long history of ulcerative colitis, which had become severe and uncontrollable despite conventional medication. Following surgery, three significant and serious problems ensued: Peristalsis did not resume; R.C. developed constant, violent hiccoughs; and, thirdly, he contracted hospital-acquired pneumonia. The excruciating post-surgical abdominal pain and weakness were eclipsed by these other problems. The hiccoughs had become incapacitating: preventing sleep, rest, and comfortable talking and breathing. R.C. was not previously a patient of mine, but his wife, a close friend, welcomed my assistance. It took under twenty minutes to piece together the previous history of the colitis. R.C. had developed the original colitis over thirty years previously, after receiving a travel vaccine. That history in addition to his current prostration, the violent hiccoughs, and his embarrassment about his medical condition led to a clear homeopathic prescription of Thuja occidentalis (a conifer known commonly as Arbor vitae or cedar). R.C.'s wife administered a dose within two hours. The hiccoughs stopped within five minutes. They returned to a lesser degree a couple of hours later then resolved completely after a second dose. They did not return. The peristalsis resumed the following day. The pneumonia resolved. R.C. was discharged, to the surprise and relief of all, two days later. The hospitalization lasted one week in all. M.B. Within a day of R.C.'s hospitalization, a friend, 68 years old and a continent away, was admitted to a reputable emergency room with sudden, unbearable kidney pain. He had a past history of kidney stones treated with lithotripsy. By the next day, M.B. had weakened dramatically and had contracted hospital-induced pneumonia. The weakness was aggravated by his previously diagnosed Parkinson's Disease. M.B. found talking difficult, his oxygen saturation level decreased, he became alarmingly weak, and he was administered oxygen in addition to a number of antibiotics. He was definitely not improving. In fact, his physician, aware that M.B.'s state was deteriorating, suggested the possibility of a ventilator to breathe for him. I consulted with his wife because M.B. was in no state to speak with me. She described his symptoms and administered the indicated homeopathic remedy, Phosphoric acid. M.B.'s energy, breathing, and mood improved almost immediately. She continued to repeat the medicine whenever his condition worsened. Within two days, M.B. was consistently stronger and oxygen saturation levels had improved. At one point, the physician entered his hospital room, prepared to consider a transfer to the ICU. She took one look at his face and realized he was on the road to recovery. M.B. received three doses of the remedy over four days. He was released from the hospital the following day and continues to recover at home. Both of these patients had a very close call with death, and, despite taking multiple powerful conventional medications, turned the corner clearly and quickly only after the addition of homeopathy. I would hope these cases, though anecdotal, would be impressive to a medical board calling into question the effectiveness of homeopathy. In India, where homeopathy is routinely used in hospital settings, such results are commonplace. In our decades of training with our Indian homeopathic mentors, we have observed hundreds of video training cases with remarkable results. "}
