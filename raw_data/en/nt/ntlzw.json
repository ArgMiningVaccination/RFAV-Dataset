Professionally, I am passionate about full-spectrum family medicine implementing integrative and functional medicine practices. After residency, I will be practicing in the Everett area doing hospice care medicine. The beauty and the people of the Pacific Northwest, along with the professional opportunities, are unbeatable! I love to explore the Pacific Northwest through hiking with my dogs and climbing adventures with friends. "}
