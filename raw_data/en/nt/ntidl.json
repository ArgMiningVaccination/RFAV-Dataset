To the Members of the Science Policy ::ask Force:We transmit herewith the sixth Background Report prepared for our Science Policy Task Force. This report is entitled \"ResearchPolicies for the Social and Behavioral Sciences\".In the development of the agenda for our two-year study of gov- ernment science policy, we decided early on that we could not pos- sibly include in our study a careful and detailed analysis of each of the disciplines within science, such as physics, chemistry, astrono- my or zoology. However, an exception was made in the case of thesocial sciences. This was due to the strong interest on the part of many of our members in the role which the results of research inthe social and behavioral sciences potentially may be able to play in our society. This is a topic which has been before the Committee on Science and Technology and other committees of the Congressen numerous occasions in recent years, in part because of questionsraised on the part of the current Administration concerning the relative priority that should be given to support for research in the social sciences in the context of the over-all support for scientific research at a time when funds for all governmental purposes were scarce.To provide an overview of this entire area of scientific research, we commissioned a comprehensive background study from the Con-gressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. We were highly fortunate that Ms. Genevieve Knew was assigned to carry out this study. Ms. Knezo's extensive knowledge and experience in the science policy field generally, and her broad knowledge of the literature dealing with the social and behavioral sciences in par- ticular has yielded a most useful study. It covers most of the ques- tions which he Task Force has raised about the past and present policies of the Federal Government's role in providing support for these areas of science, and provided, we believe, a solid foundation for our own evaluation of the future policies which our Govern- ment should pursue with regard to the support and utilization of research results in these fields of science.We commend this study to the attention of the members of the Science Policy Task Force, the members of the Committee on Sci- ence and Technology and the interested members of the Congress.Yours truly,DON FUQUA,Chairman.MANUEL LUJAN,Ranking Republican Member. 5 LETTER OF SUBMITTAL CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE,THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS,Washington, DC, May 8, 1986.Hon. DON FUQUA,Chairman, Committee on Science and Technology, U.S. House ofRepresentatives, Washington, DC.DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: We are very pleased to transmit thisreport entitled The Evolution of US. Behavioral and Social Sci-ences Research Policies: An Overview of the Federal Role, The Sizeof the Community, Non-Governmental Support, Advisory Commis-sion Studies, and Issues in Utilization of Research. The report wasprepared in response to a request of the Task Force on SciencePolicy of the House Committee on Science and Technology for anhistorical study of selected public and private aspects of the govern-ance, support, and use of the behavioral and social science duringthe last 40 years. As is characteristic of Congressional ResearchService policy reports, programmatic and policy options are dis-cussed impartially, but no recommendations are made.This report was prepared by a team of CRS analysts under thecoordination of Genevieve J. Knezo, Specialist in Science and Tech-nology. Edith F. Cooper, Analyst in Science and Technology, pre-pared the first draft of sectioi. B of chapter V and compiled thetables on Federal agency funding. Christine Matthews Rose pre-pared intial drafts to chapters VI and VIII. Nancy Connors, an An-alyst in Science and Technology during the summer of 1985, pre-pared the draft of the case study on intelligence testing that is pre-sented in chapter X. Ms. Knew drafted the rest of this study andedited the entire manuscript.A preliminary draft of this report was delivered to the TaskForce for background use for hearings held in the summer and fallof 1985. Also, the draft was circulated for peer comment, at the re-quest of the committee, to interested experts. In response, we re-ceived critiques, comments, and information from staff of the Na-tional Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, theNational Science Foundation, the Consortium of Social Science As-sociations, the American Psychological Association, the AmericanAnthropological Association, the Federation of Behavioral, Psycho-logical and Cognitive Sciences, as well as from individual behavior-al and social scientists and policy researchers within and outside ofthe Government. The project coordinator took these comments intoaccount in preparing the final draft of this report.We appreciate having been asked to undertake this analysis ofcritical governmental programs and policies for these vital and ex-citing fields of science. We hope this report meets the needs of theTask Force on Science Policy.Sincerely,JOSEPH E. Ross, Director.(v)6 CONTENTS Page I. Introduction and Executive Summary 1 II.

INTRODUCTION AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARYThe Task Force on Science Policy of the House Committee onScience and Technology, as part of its series of background studieson major science policy issues since 1945, asked the CongressionalResearch Service to prepare a study surveying the governance, use,and support of the behavioral and social sciences in the UnitedStates for the last forty years. This document was requested toserve as background information for the hearings on the same sub-ject, held in 1985, and as part of the publications series of the TaskForce. Specifically, the committee requested:(a) An estimate of the size of the social and behavioral re-search community in the United States, including the numberof researchers and research organizations by discipline;(b) An analysis of past expenditures by Federal agencies insupport of these sciences and current trends;(c) An analysis of non-governmental funding for the socialand behavioral sciences;(d) An analysis, through a limited number of case studies ofthe advantages and disadvantages of using the research resultsof social and behavioral sciences in public and private decision-making about policy issues;(e) A review of past studies in this field, the recommenda-tions they contain, and their impact;(f) The criteria that have in the past been used to justifyFederal support for these sciences and the validity of those cri-teria;(g) The extent to which the distinction between basic and ap-plied research applies to the social and behavioral sciences;and(h) \"...[O]ther aspects...\" deemed relevant. This study addresses these issues. Conclusions and implicationsfor policy are summarized in chapter 12. The following is a summa-ry of the main findings of this report.In this study the terms behavioral sciences and psychological sci-ences are equivalent. In addition, the fields of science encompassedare those which the National Science Foundation categorizes as' psychology\" and as \"social sciences.\" Federal agencies fund basicand applied research in these fields, as well as development, dis-semination, and related activities. Federal funding for research inthese disciplines is estimated to total about $722 million for thefiscal year 1986. Although no current, accurate figures are avail-able, Federal funding for development and dissemination and relat-ed' activities in these disciplines was estimated to total just over $1billion (nominal dollars) in 1977. The National Science Foundationreported that there were 390,700 employed behavioral and socialscien:,:zto in 1983, the latest year for which appropriate data areavailable. About 12 percent of these scientists conducted research(1)13 2and development. Many behavioral and social scientists are em-ployed in academia. But a growing number are employed in indus-try. For instance, the social science survey research industry hasbeen called a \"$4 billion a year business.\" Many other behavioraland social scientists are employed in high-technology businesses, inStates and local government, and in clinical settings.This report answers some specific historical questions about thegovernance, support, and use of the behavioral and social sciences.It shows that the Federal Government has played the most deter-minate role of all funding sponsors, but a well-defined Federal re-search support role did not emerge until after World War II. Priorto World War II, foundations helped establish \"core\" research in-stitutes and supported some methodological development in the be-havioral and social sciences. Since then, Foundations often havefunded, among other things, research on controversial social issueswhich Government has tended to avoid. Federal support for behav-ioral and social research since 1967 totals about 11 billion dollarsand constitutes the lion's share of support for U.S. basic and ap-plied research in the behavioral and social sciences. This repre-sents about 5.8 percent of the approximately $189 billion in Federalfunding for research in all scientific disciplines since 1967. If totalFederal expenditures for behavioral and social sciences (includingdevelopment, dissemination, and related activities) were added to-gether, this total probably would at least double to $22 billion. (Ac-curate data are not available, this figure was calculated on thebasis of a survey made of 1977 activities.)The Government clearly distinguishes basic research supportfrom applied research support. Some scientists object to this differ-entiation and argue that there are no sig_iificant differences be-tween basic and applied research and that both may generate newknowledge or have potential applications. Others promote the di-chotomy, saying that utilization of research will be enhanced onlyif basic research is clearly distinguished from applied, and if sepa-rate training programs, expectations, and oversight criteria areused. They also argue that a dichotomy clarifies the rationale forFederal support of basic research and protects the pluralistic struc-ture of U.S. research support and production, the hallmark of theNation's rich scientific productivity.Since 1945, most Federal support has been for applied research,not for basic, in. the ratio of 3 applied to 1 basic for social sciencesresearch and 2 applied to 1 basic for behavioral sciences. The Gov-ernment supports more social sciences than behavioral sciences re-search. Agencies whose mission is research support have providedabout 30 percent of Federal research funds for these disciplines;mission-oriented agencies (the Department of Defense and thesocial agencies) support the bulk. Basic support in these fields hascome largely from the agencies whose primary mission is re- searchthe National Science Foundation and the National Insti-tutes of Health and agencies of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, andMental Health Administration (ADAMHA). The largest supportersof applied research in these disciplines are the Departments ofHealth and Human Services, Agriculture, and Defense. The De-partments of Health and Human Services and of Defense are thelargest supporters of psychology research; the largest supporters of4 1 3social sciences research are the Departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture, and Education.The National Academy of Sciences estimated that Federal fund- ing for behavioral and social \"knowledge production and applica- tion\" totaled about $1.9 billion in 1977, with about $700 million going for research and $300 million for development. Federal fund- ing for related activities (including program evaluations, general purpose statistics, demonstrations for policy implementation anddissemination)which are important elements of Federal policiesfor behavioral and social sciences because they employ behavioral and social scientists and generate information for decisionmakerstotaled $874 million in 1977 (the aforementioned dollar figures in- clude salaries and expenses and overhead for the activities de- scribed.) Currently funding data are published only about research in these fields.Federal support for the behavioral and social sciences, as a pro- portion of funding for all research fields, started decreasing in the late 1970s. The decrease was accelerated beginning in 1981, with the advent of the Reagan Administration. Federal support for be- havioral sciences did not decrease in all agencies, but priorities were changed to deemphasize social factors. Cuts were made in theNSF support programs (offset, in some cases by increases in other agencies). Support for social sciences research was decreased sub- stantially. Funding levels in subsequent years have not reached the fiscal year 1980 funding level when expressed in terms of constant dollars.Today Federal support for research in these fields constitutes about 4.8 percent of all funds awarded for scientific research, the same proportion as the pre-\"Great Society\", that is pre-1965, fund-ing levels. In 1986, estimated, in terms of constant 1972 dollars, the funding level of $296 million is 27 percent lower than the average annual support level of $405 million during the period of 1970 to 1980, and is 35 percent below the peak level reached in 1978. How- ever, behavioral and social sciences manpower increased about 40percent over the period 1970 to 1980.There appear to be widespread applications of federally support- ed behavioral and social research in clinical, administrative, and technical settings. But there are complaints that much federally supported behavioral and social research is not used effectively for policymaking purposes and that the impact of such research on pol- icymaking is not direct and apparent (in the terms of what has been described as a \"social engineering\" model). Many experts agr'e that behavioral and social science research informationserves effectively when it is measured in terms of \"enlighteningdecisionmakers,\" in a cumulative process over a long period of time. According to this model, usually no one particular study can be identified as affecting policy, but knowledge accumulates over time and influences decisionmakers by helping them to frame ques- tions for discussion regarding policy options or by allowing them to reject solutions that will not be effective. It may be that an \"en- lightenment\" model of utilization is the most appropriate to use in evaluating use of behavioral and social research in policy, giventhe fact that crucial political factors and choices and value consid- 4erations are more important determinants of most policy outcomesthan is objective scientific information.It may be that some expectations for using behavioral and socialscience research directly in policymaking do not recognize themany obstacles both to the production of policy-relevant knowledgeand also to its application in complex processes of bureaucratic andpolitical decisionmaking. Some of these obstacles that affect re-searchers are discussed in this report. They include: producingcounterintuitive findings, producing research which is irrelevant topolicyrnaking, political naivete regarding bureaucratic functioningand the vagaries of political decisionmaking, conflicts stemmingfrom the need to respond to the academic reward system whichmay differ from the rewards of policy-advising, inadequate knowl- edge and inappropriate quantification, and fraud and deception.Some believe that application and utilization of knowledge inthese fields of science would be enhanced if Federal agencies sup-ported, and if researchers promoted, the conduct of more long-range research, with priorities determined on an interagency basis, about the fundamental aspects of behavioral and social issues ofconcern to policymakers. This is in contrast to determining re- search funding priorities primary on the basis of internal scientificchoice, curiosity, or the short-term applied research needs of Feder-al agencies. This notion coincides in part with debate now begin-ning in the field of science and technology policy about whetherscientists benefitting from Federal funding should support \"moresocially responsible\" fundamental research.1There also have been recommendations that Federal funding forbehavioral and social research relevant for policymaking would beenhanced if there were more consideration given to: including theissue of implementation in research designs, improving linkages be-tween decisionmakers and scientists, creating Government-fundedpolicy research units, improving information dissemination, andcreating \"research broker' staffs. Some believe that the growingfield of policy sciences may offer decisionmakers useful policy andprogram guidance.Current policy concerns arise from criticisms made regarding in-effective utilization of some kinds of behavioral and social researchand the need to determine appropriate priorities for Federal fund-ing in an era of budget austerity. The following are among themajor policy issues raised for possible further consideration by bothsocial and behavioral scientists and by policymakers: Is behavioraland social research somehow less \"scientific\", objective, or rigorousthan the natural and physical sciences? Should the Federal Gov-ernment collect more accurate information to describe support ofthe fields of behavioral and social science? Should agencies coordi-nate research programs to: enhance cross-fertilization betweenbasic and applied research, to support the conduct of more \"sociallyrelevant\" longer-range research, and to improve dissemination ofthe results of federally supported research efforts' Who should de-termine what is \"socially relevant\" longer-range research? Will theintegrity of these fields of science be significantly jeopardized if be- , Shapley, Deborah and Rustum Roy. Lost at the Frontier. U.S. Science and Technology PolicyAdrift. Philadelphia, ISI Press, 1985, 223 p.P'i16 5havioral and social scientists give more attention to doing researchwhich is intended to serve some potential policy purpose? Shouldthe Government reexamine the various institutional arrangements proposed to produce more relevant behavioral and social researchfor policy purposes?During the last few years, there has begun what may be perma- nent long-term employment shifts from academia to other employ-ment sectorsespecially industry. The primary activity of behav-ioral and social scientists in industry is not research. National Sci-ence Foundation data describe an oversupply of some types of be-havioral and social scientists, but not necessarily in the areas sought by industry. There is some evidence that Federal support policies may be decreasing the supply of scientific personnel in thebehavioral and social sciences. This raises policy questions aboutwhether industry and/or government should play a larger role in supporting research and training in specifically targetted subfieldswithin the behavioral and social sciences, and about the need for enhancing partnerships between these two sectors. 17 II. AN OVERVIEW OF SOME MAJOR ASPECTS IN THE HISTO- RY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOV- ERNMENT AND THE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCESA. INTRODUCTIONThe pace and direction ofmany critical events and developmentsin the behavioral and social sciences as sciences have been Influ- enced by the Nation's social and political environment and chang- ing social conditions. (Fora description of fields encompassed, seefootnote 1 below).1 Many developments have been determined largely by direct and indirect actions of the Federal Government.2 This chapter traces some major events in the history of the Fed- eral Government relationship with the behavioral and social sci- ences with respect to such areas as basic research, applied re- search, defense, and the \"Great Society\" programs. Efforts to \"in- stitutionalize\" these sciences in government are traced, and atten- tion is given to the policies of the Reagan Administration.B. PRE-WORLD WAR IIThe social sciences, which derived some of their early ideas and personnel from the fields of moral philosophy and social work, were first organized as scientific disciplines in the United States in the 1880s.3The first type of Federal sponsorship of behavioral and social re- search was confined to the problem-solving needs of Government. Kenneth Prewitt, when hewas President of the Social Science Re-search Council, reportedan early instance of Federal support ofsocial research: a small research grant from the Secretary of the Treasury to a Professor Bates of the University of Pennsylvania to study bursting steam boilers. Bates and his team reported that the The Task Force on Science Policy, as noted in chapter I, requested that this study deal with the \"social and behavioral sciences.\" The National Science Foundation collects funding and per- sonnel data for these fields of science, but uses the categories of \"psychology' and \"social sci- ences.\" Because NSF data are used extensively throughout this report, in this report the terms \"behavioral\" science encompasses those fields of science included under in the I.SF category \"psychology\" and \"social\" science encompasses those fields of included the NSF cate- gory \"social sciences.\" NSF divides \"psychology\" into social aspects, and psychological sciences, n.e.c. \"Social science\" includes, according to NSF, anthropol- ogy, economics, political science, sociology, and social sciences, n.e.c. The term \"n.e.c.\" is for \"not elsewhere classified,\" which is defined as including \"multi-disciplinary projects within a broad field and single-discipline projects for which a separate field has not been assigned.\" tU.S. National Science foundation Federal Funds for Research and Development.

Today theDepartment of Agriculture funds the third largest amount of be-havioral and social research, after the Departments of Health andHuman Services and Defense. (See table 1.) The Census Bureau isanother example of an early and continuous user of federallyfunded social science data collection and methodology. Anotherkind of major link between social science and the Government cc-curred in 1885, according to Prewitt, when Government created theBureau of Labor Statistics, to help provide non-biased policy rele-vant labor statistics to help overcome a period of major \"civil strifeand industrial violence\", as well as the need to deal with labor re-formers pressing for improvements in working conditions.6 TABLE 1.-FEDERAL OBLIGATIONS FOR RESEARCH IN BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, BYAGENCY AND CHARACTER OF WORK, FISCAL YEARS 1965, 1975, AND 1985 (ESTIMATED)[In Ulmer& of Mrs) Sccial scamsBehr/oafsomaTotal, socialand behavioralTotal, ag fields 1965 Total research 127,389103,479230,8684,853,884AU agencies basic research 36,93157,76394,6941,689,931lasic research at universities and colleges NANANANA NSFTotal, basic and applied 11,7727,28519,057171,732Basic research 11,0977,28518,382171,057Basic research at universities and colleges NANANANA DliEW/DliliSTotal, basic and applied 50,64464,644115,288861,735Basic research 9,77534,87444,649302,915Basic research at universities and colleges NANANANA AGRICULTURETotal, basic and applied 25,793(I)25,793217,824Basic research 5,239(I)5,23990,254Basic research at universities and colleges NA(I)NANA DEFENSETotal, basic and applied 4,88621,32196,2071,751,493Basic research 2,2607,95510,215263,326Basic research at universities and colleges NANANANA,EDUCATIONTotal, basic and appliedBasic research( 2( 2))( 2( 2))(2)( 2 )( 2 )( 2 ) 4 Prewitt, Kenneth.

(See chapter VI in this report.) This distance arguably en- hanced the scientific basis of these disciplines. Prewitt reportedthat during this period, essentially the last decade of the nine-teenth century and the first forty years of the twentieth century,\"important parts of the social sciences turned inward\" and de-tached themselves from the political agenda \"in an effort to achieve scientific respectability.\" This period led to major growthof the theoretical and methodological bases of the disciplines, ac- cording to Prewitt and Theda Skocpol, which has given these disci-plines a comparative edge internationally. In other countries theysaid, these disciplines were not developed as quickly, because gov- ernments .''requently called upon behavioral and social scientists toprovide applied research products. As a result, their intellectualand scientific advance was constrained in contrast with develop-ments in the United States, where these sciences flourished intel-22 12lectually. However, social scientists in other countries did learnhow to interact with decisionmakers and to build up the public sup-port and coalitions necessary to influence vlicymaking directly, atradition that was lacking in the United States.?Social historians disagree somewhat about the influence of socialscientists in the New Deal. Prewitt concluded that although the de-layed emergence of a welfare state ideology in the United Statesallowed these sciences the time and freedom to \"look inward\",these disciplines did not make much of a contribution to New Dealsocial legislation. Exceptions include the cases of rural sociologistsand agricultural economists who helped to ,resign the \"farm creditsystem.\" 8Government economists and statisticians influenced by the writ-ings of John Maynard Keyes, are credited with having helped todesign the fiscal policies of the 1930s and the social securitysystem,9 but, according to Prewitt, \"the voluminous Recent SocialTrends, commissioned by President Herbert Hoover and deliveredto President Franklin D. Roosevelt had but slight impact on theNew Deal.\" 10 This 1,500 page report was prepared under the direc-tion of W.F. Ogburn, a sociologist. It was released in 1933. (In 1983the National Academy of Sciences held a symposium focused on afifty year retrospective analysis of the Ogburn report with an ac-count of behavioral and social science achievements during the lastfive decades. It was published in 1985 as Behavioral and Social Sci-ence: Fifty Years of Discovery.\"C. WARTIME AND POST-WORLD WAR IIGovernment called upon all scientific disciplines during WorldWar II and behavioral and social scientists were no exception. Gov-ernment and university scientists were used by military and civil-ian tgencies alike in an effort to design programs to cope with therapid social dislocations and changes prevelant in wartime andthen in conversion to peacetime. Behavioral and social science re-search made major contributions to propaganda analysis, studies ofmorale, wage and price surveys, military intelligence, military re-cruitment, and design of the GI bill.\"After the war, the social and behavioral sciences, especially soci-ology, economics, political science, and anthropology, contributed tosuch areas as occupation policies, design and programs to imple-ment new German and Japanese constitutions, and the develop-ment of such programs as Point IV, which provided technical as-sistance to the newly emerging nations, the United Nations, and Skocpol, Theda.

These fundamental meth- odologies later proved useful in doing applied social research de- manded by the Government during the 1960s and 1970s for the design and evaluation of the \"Great Society\" programs.\" Following the war, legislation was enacted in 1946, which result- ed in the establishment of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in 1949. This inaugurated a significant period of growth in governmental funding for the behavioral sciences, In fact, Nelson reported that by January 1967 when the NIMH was transferred from the National Institutes of Health and raised to bureau status within the Public Health Service, it was the largest NIH institute, accounting for 22 percent of NIH's total budget, and \"was nearly twice the size of the Cancer Institute, the second largest insti- tute.\" 15D. THE SOCIAL SCIENCES IN NSFWhen the National Science Foundation was created in 1950, sup- port for social sciences was given only reluctantly. The social sci- ences were permitted to be funded slowly, under NSF's permissive mandate to support \"other sciences\" and were not given an explicit mandate. Support was awarded only for quantitative, scientific, as opposed to policy-oriented studies. This occurred because \"many of the physical scientists who were most influential in shaping the NSF also feared that an active social science research program would produce a political backlash in Congress that would hurt the natural sciences as well.\"\" A prominent view was that \"the social and the physical sciences have nothing in common and that, at best, the social sciences area propagandist, reformist, evangelicalsort of cult.\"\" According to Roberta Balstad Miller, \"The failure to include the social sciences in NSF was due to three factors; oppo- sition by key scientists; conservatives' fears that social science re- search would emphasize potential political problems such as racial inequality; and the failure of social scientists to make a strong bid for their inclusion.\" 18 \" See, for example. \"The Point IV Program.

(NSF 82-84.)24 14Very early, the National Science Foundation outlined the crite-ria which were to govern support for the social sciences and whichcontinue to prevail today, thirty-five years later. An NSF officialrecommended that to be eligible for support, \"[projects] should bemethodologically rigorous, important for national welfare and de-fense, convergent with the natural sciences, and characterized byobjectivity, verifiability and generality.\" 9Skepticism within the Congress and within the NSF about the\"scientific\" nature of the social sciences led to a pattern of slow in-cremental growth for the psychological and ;oda' sciences in NSF.Support for these fields gradually increased in NSF, so that by1958, when the Foundation created a Social Sciences Research Pro-gram, the social sciences were awarded approximately $600 thou-sand annually. Funding for psychology was not reported separate-ly. See tables 13 and 14. NSF funding for psychological and socialsciences increased gradually and steadily over the years, to about$64 million annually in the period 1976 to 1979, and thereafter fellto about $39 million in 1982, with the cuts instituted by the ReaganAdministration. For the fiscal year 1986, behavioral and social sci-ences were allocated about $53 million or 3.8 percent of NSF's re-search support budget, about one-half the percentage levels allocat-ed in the late 1970s.NSF's \"permissive,\" or tacit, responsibility to support these disci-plines was expanded in 1968, whet. 'he Congress revised NSF's or-ganic act to, among other things, make explicit the foundation's re-sponsibility to support social sciences research and applied re-search. (P.L. 90-407, July 18, 1968.) However, the type and objec-tives of NSF's support programs in the areas of behavioral andsocial science research have, after some exceptions in the 1970s,continued to focus primarily on quantitatively or theoretically ori-ented studies, in response to continuing apprehensions about NSFsupporting policy-oriented research.It should be pointed out that although some few behavioral andsocial scientists were made members of the National Academy ofSciences in the 1960s, it was not until the Academy's 1971 annualmeeting that its membership voted to make eligible for member-ship a class of scientists in the \"behavioral and social sciences.\"Doubts and criticisms about the scientific nature of the social sci-ences continue to characterize support for these fields in NSF and in congressional funding debates up through the early 1980s. Ac-cording to William Wells, a former staff member of the HouseCommittee on Science and Technology, \"Leigh Shaffer has quotedSenator William Proxmire as saying in an interview with the APAMonitor, 'It's too bad they're called sciences, because they are notquite. I don't know what they are. They're somewhere between sci-ence and art.' This is a view which spans 40 years of science policydebates.\" 20 i Brooks.

RESEARCH FOR THE \"GREAT SOCIETY\" PROGRAMS IN THE 1960sDuring the 1960s the notion of \"social engineering\" became ac- cepted in Government. Thiswas the view that technology and/or social science information could be used to design government poli- cies to solve social and political problems. The techniques and promises of operations research and systems analysis, which had been used in the military, became prevalent in social policy. For instance, the Rand Corporation which had been been created after World War II to serve the Air Force, developed a research bra. .h \"to perform analyses of New York's service delivery problems and improve the efficiency with which its human and physical re- sources were being used.\"22 The political climate shifted markedlyto favor governmental intervention to deal with social problems during the Kennedy-Johnson years. This led to attitudes conduciveto the utilitization of social research in policymaking. Early work in using operations research activities to deal with social problems was followed by the application of computer simulation and use of statistical methods and modelling. This helped generate govern- mental enthusiasm and support for using social research in \"a series of large-scale social experiments designed to explore the impact on employment incentives of a negative income tax, and similar experiments to test housing vouchers and schools vouchers as alternativs for introducing market-like mechanisms in the ad-ministration of social programs.\"23During this period, the passage of the Great Society legislation and the creation and/or expansion of the applied social research programs of several mission agencies was based on the premisethat social science could contribute to the design and evaluation of government programs to combat urban decay, crime, difficultieswith housing, unequal employment, and \"Wars of National Libera- tion.\" Federal support for behavioral and social research increased by 96 percent, from about $118 million to $231 million during the period 1962 to 1965. Most of this was for applied research. See table 2 and chart A. During the 1960s the Nation also witnessed the cre- 3' Testimony by John B Slaughter before the Subcommittee on Science.

It was also during this period that numerous applied social sci-ence research companies were created to do governmental con-tracts in the social policy area. Examples of these firms are Abt A s-sociates, Mathematica, and the MITRE Corporation.By 1978, it was estimated that the Federal Government was allo-cating about $1.8 billion annually to the production and use ofsocial knowledge.24The social inforMation needs of Federal social policy agencieshave led to the growth of a major new field of applied social sci-enceprogram evaluationand the proliferation of a broad litera-ture in the field. Congress specified in some legislation that evalua-tions were to be conducted, and, in others, mandated that a mini-mum of one percent of program funds were to be awarded for theconduct of evaluations.25 Several congressional inquiries were con-ducted during this period on the potential utility of these fields toprogram and policy akinm g.2 6Social experimentation and program planning and evaluation ef-forts have not been entirely successful. It is generally concededthat the experiments did provide good data but their solutionsoften were rejected by decisionmakers for various reasons, amongthem, \"...the contemplated social policies from which they hadderived their motivation had run out of political steam by the timethe results of the experiments were available, and a number of the.questions being addressed by the experiments were obsolete '_'romthe point of view of the different sort of political options then beingconsidered.\" 27 For instance, one major study, of income dynamics,traced economic behavior over time, and concluded that peoplemove in and out of poverty, and that a Government suppliedincome supplement to poor people would create little disincentiveto work for primary wage earners, but slightly more for secondarywage earners.28 By the time the results of this study were released,prevailing political attitudes had shifted toward seeking \"work-fare\" programs. 24 Abramson, N....rk A.

This program reflectedthe premise that technological solutions and \"social engineering\"could help stave off urban blight and invigorate the service sectorof the cities. NSF awarded funds totaling about $484 million to theprogram during the period 1971 to 1978, when the program wasterminated because of management and political problems.\"However, applied social research funding had been funded athigh levels in the RANN program, to the extent that some social scientists perceived it was a threat to NSF's basic social science re- search program.

DEFENSE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL It'SEARCHDefense Department social researchinthe 1960s includedprojects by American social scientists to study the sociopolitical fac-tors which might promote or deter counterrevolutionary move-ments in Latin America, Vietnam, and other countries and to de-velop recommendations about how to halt such movements. Astudy called Project Camelot, dealt with Chile. Despite the views ofsome social scientists that this kind of information was crucial forU.S. security and wholly within the realm of ethically acceptablesocial research,\" the project was halted after charges by some poli-ticians and social scientists that the project was unethical and thatsocial scientists should not interfere in the social affairs of othercountries. Some believe that curtailing this kind of research (whichalso had been conducted in Southeast Asia) left lingering inadequa-cies in American understanding of the cultures of foreign countriesand ultimately handicapped U.S. capabilities to anticipate and re-spond effectively to counterrevolutionary movements in Vietnamand the Middle East.The epis.Ale also generated several self-critiques by social scien-tists and attempts by some of the professional social science asso-ciations to develop codes of ethics for social research. These havebeen discussed, for instance by Myrda1,32 Sjoberg,33 Beals,34Lipset,35 and Horowitz.3 6The furor about Project Camelot in 1965 occurred contemporane-ously with the growing student opposition to the war in Vietnamand to university conduct of Defense Department classified re-search or to campus research that led to weapons. Campus riots,bombings, and other violent acts during the late 1960s were direct-ed against laboratories and professors who were DOD grantees orcontractors. This action occurred during an era of decreasing DODattention to the conduct of basic research in favor of using scarcebudgetary resources for the Vietnam War.37 The Congress reactedto these actions and others by enacting the Mansfield Amendmentin 1969. This legislation and its modified, more liberal successorthe following year, basically prohibited the DOD and, some say 3O Larsen, Otto N. Social Science Out of the Closet.

Funding for social re- search was cut 42 percent between 1967 and 1970 (in terms of con- stant 1972 dollars) and has never been restored to the 1967 level.However, some social scientists played continuing roles in design-ing the \"limited war doctrine\" in Vietnam and assisted in Agencyfor International Development Programs. See tables 19 and 20.In addition, congressional reaction and criticism to the Camelotepisode \" Tesulted in a Defense Department announcement that inthe future, foreign countries would have to approve DOD surveys and social research conducted within their bo. lers; in the shiftingof resources from DOD to the State Departme. t for the conduct ofrelated \"foreign area\" research; and in the ;reation of severalinteragency coordination groups, such as Foreign Affairs ResearchCouncil and the Interagency Foreign Area Research CoordinationGroup to review projects for political sensitivity.\" The NationalAcademy of Sciences and the Defense Science Board also studiedthis issue. (DOD's support of behavioral science is substantial andfocuses on personnel policies, all volunteer forces, human factors,ergonomics, and so forth.)H. PROPOSALS TO INSTITUTIONALIZE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIALSCIENCES IN GOVERNMENTThe Camelot and Vietnam episodes also triggered a general ex- amination of how the Government might better support and use the social sciences in policymaking. Congressman Dante Fascell,chairman of the subcommittee which held hearings on Camelot, in-troduced three related bills, in June 1966. One proposed a White House Conference on the Social and Behavioral Sciences. Thesecond would have established an Office of Social Sciences in theExecutive Office of the President, modeled on the Office of Scienceand Technolgy, to advise the President on the priorities, coordina-tion and use of federally supported behavioral and social researchprograms. The third would have created a National Social ScienceFoundation as.a counterpart to the National Science Foundation tosupport and guide the development and use of these disciplines.Senator Fred R. Harris introduced a counterpart bill in the Senateto create a National Social Science Foundation. Extensive hearingswere held on the proposal, but many social scientists opposed it be-cause they feared that the social sciences would be more vulnerable 58 The original Mansfield Amendment was P.L. 90-121, sec. 203. The modified Mansfieldamendment is P.L 91-441, sec. 204.

In addition in February 1968, President Johnson expandedthe President's Science Advisory Committee by appointing HerbertSimon, the first social scientist ever to be appointed to that group.Formal attempts to institutionalize social research in decision-making were prevalent during the 1960s and early 1970s. In 1970,the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare held a hearingon a bill to create the George Washington Memorial Institute forthe Social Sciences, to support and conduct policy-relevant socialresearch.42 The bill had been introduced by Senator GeorgeMcGovern. A House companion bill was introduced by Rep.Thomas Foley. No further action was taken.I. SOCIAL INDICATORS ACTIVITIESThe \"social indicators movement\" during the 1960s and 1970swas another manifestation of the view that if there ere better in- formation describing society and its changes, then policymakerswould be able to use it to des. elop more effective programs and poli-cies. The earliest Federal funding for research on social indicatorswas awarded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-tion to a social scientist to study the impact of the space programon society. Subsequently, in 1966 President Lyndon B. Johnson, inhis Message on Health and Education, instructed the Secretary ofHealth, Education and Welfare to marshall an interdepartmentaleffort to collect and develop a set of social statistics and indicatorsfor a presidential social report.43Thereafter, several of the social science study commissions (dis-cussed in this report in Chapter VII), recommended the institution-alization of a social indicators function and unit in Governmentanalogous to the use of economic indicators and the advisory func-tions of the Council of Economic Advisors.44 Hearings were held in1967, 1969, 1970, and 1971 on congressional proposals introduced tocreate a Council of Social Advisors and a social indicators monitor-ing function, but the bills were never enacted.45 41 U.S. Congress.

There seemed tobe general agreement, according to the NSF official in charge ofthese programs, that by 1981 \". .. this ...entire line of research had reached the limit permitted by both the state-of-the-art andthe levels of funding which could justifiably be invested in it.\"4 6 Acoordinated NSF program was terminated, although research hasbeen continued under the support of private foundations and as part of the regular research programs at NSF.47Several social indicators reports were published by the Executivebranch of Government during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Infact, in 1969, President Nixon established the National Goals Re-search Staff in the White House to forecast and monitor socialtrends on the quality of life of the American people. Later, the De-partment of Health, Education, and Welfare and the Office of Man-agement and Budget took over the social indicators reporting activ-ity and prepared three social indicators reports.48 But, the reportspublished by these agencies were criticized, and defended, becauseof lack of consensus about what social categories should be moni-tored by Government.J. SOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTBeginning in the 1960s, social research came to be viewed as an important part of the growing movement to stem environmentaldegradation and to monitor the excesses of technological applica-tion. Environmental impact statements mandated by section 102(2)(B) and 204 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,P.L. 91-190, were determined by judicial interpretation to requireassessments of the \"human environment\" 49 and to include cost-benefit analyses, which often contained social impact assessments.Social scientists increasingly were called upon to participate inwriting environmental impact assessments.In 1972, the Congress passed legislation which declared that\"...it is necessary for the Congress to ...equip itself which new 1st Bess. 3 volumes: Parts 1. 2, 3.

EVALUATION ACTIVITIES IN CONGRESSCongressional recognition of the potential utility of social re- search was reflected in two actions during the 1970s, both initiatedpuisuant to the passage of the Congressional Budget and Impound-ment Control Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-344, July 12, 1984). One was thecreation of the Congressional Budget Office, to provide the Con-gress with economic analyses and data to improve the budget-making process. The other was to give the General AccountingOffice added responsibilities to provide assistance to the Congressin using program evaluations. Subsequently, the General Account-ing Office created an Institute for Program Evaluation, whichhelps other GAO units improve the quality of GAO evaluation in-formation to Congress, recommends improvements of evaluationmethodology to executive agencies, and prepares syntheses of eval-uations conducted for executive agencies.L. CRITICISMS AND CUTS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH BUDGETSBEGINNING IN THE LATE 1970'sThe initial enthusiasm for using social information in policymak-ingwhether via social indicators, the RANN program, socialimpact assessment, or in social program planning and evaluationdiminished during the 1970s. A variety of factors contributed, in-cluding overenthusiastic and unfulfilled expectations; disillusion-ment with behavioral and social scientists, who, some policymakersconcluded, had engineered the \"Great Society\", which was viewedby many as a failure; and economic slowdown and burgeoning defi-cits, which tended to change the political climate and to limitpolicy options, effectively foreclosing consideration of some of thesocial and equity issues raised in social science analyses. There wasalso frustration with foreign and economic aid and national securi-ty policies to which social science inputs had been perceived to besubstantial but which seemed to exacerbate distrust. Yet in allthese areas social science research and analysis methodology wasused to critique past policies and performance.In terms of constant (1972) dollars, Federal funding for behavior-al and social science research reached a high in fiscal year 1971,then fell until 1976, when funding started to increase. The increas-ing trend lasted until 1978, when it started to drop precipitously,with funding for the period 1982-1985 going below even the fund- 6\u00b0 See, for example, Finsterbusch, Kurt and C.P.

Otto Larsen, asenior advisor on social and behavioral sciences at the NationalScience Foundation, discussed the implications of this trend forNSF funding and noted that while there were cuts for behavioraland social science research, funding for other areas of science in-creased:The strong budget cuts of 1981-1982 were a punctuationof a process underway. This can be seen by noting that inconstant (1972) dollars, the obligations for social science re-search at NSF never again exceeded the 1976 level in anyof the following years through 1984. For the nine-yearperiod, 1976-84, the decline for social science in currentdollars was 4.6 percent and in constant dollars it was 44.5percent. While support for social science was going down-hill...for a decade, increased support for all other areasof science at NSF was accelerating. For example, in thatsame time period support for biology increased 120.3 per-cent in current dollars and 28.1 percent in constant dol-lars.51In fact, in certain quarters the lack of enthusiasm for the socialsciences was so great that the House passed legislation introducedby Representative John Ashbrook, it 1979, that some suspectedhad an underlying intent of \" 'gutting the social science program\"in the National Science Foundation. Mr. Ashbrook's stated purposewas to eliminate the purported low quality social research grantsNSF awarded, to avoid duplication and competition with private re-search, and to cease the support of ideologically based researchinthe words of Mr. Ashbrook, \"the crucial issue of subsidies for par-ticular philosophical views.\" 52 Mr. Ashbrook gave the following asexamples:...We have seen how scholarly works have been usedto launch major new government policies or programs overrecent years. It was a study on the learning abilities ofschool children that launched the nightmare of busing. Itwas a series of computer runs that helped launch an effortto eliminate the electoral college.. ..What happens if the NSF ends up funding a series of projects that build mo-mentum for one eat of public policy views over another? 53According to an on-the-scene observer, William Wells, a formerstaff member of the House Committee on Science and Technology,\"defective wording in the amendment applied the cut to the entireline-item of the biological, behavioral, and social sciencesand ulti-mately the cut was resto..-ed in conference with the Senate. But thisincident was only a mild example of what lay ahead.\"54 63 Larsen, Otto N. Social Science Out of the Closet. Society. Jan./Feb. 1985. 14.\" Zilches, James J.

CHANGES IN POLICIES FOR BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCERESEARCH IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATIONCuts in funding for some kinds of behavioral research and mostsocial research were accelerated and became a major policy issue beginning 1981, with the advent of the Administration of PresidentRonald Reagan. The Administration made major cuts and redirect-ed most Federal behavioral and social sciences research supportprograms. In the fiscal year 1980, the Government obligated $772.8million for the support of basic and applied behavioral and socialresearch. In 1982, the total obligational level had decreased to$604.3 million. In terms of current dollars, budget levels were notrestored to equal or exceed the FY 1980 levels for most agenciesuntil the FY 1984 budget; however, changes had been made in re-search priorities. In terms of constant dollars the FY 1985 level is24 percent below the FY 1980 level. See table 4 and chart B.

Cuts also were proposed for mostother Federal agencies which supported behavioral and social sci-ence research, including the National Institute of Mental Health,the National Institute of Justice, and the Department of Housingand Urban Development, and the social policy offices of the De-partment of Health and Human Services.55 However, consistentwith increases overall in defense research, funding for psychologi-cal research in the Department of Defense was increased about 70percent.In addition, the Administration attempted to eliminate, or se-verely curtail, the functions of some agencies with missions to ex-amine national social policy options. For example, the Administra-tion's request for research funding for the Office of the AssistantSecretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) in the Departmentof Health and Human Services, for FY 1986, was $6 million, a dropof 75 percent from the $24 million level requested in FY 1980.56 InJuly 1985, it was announced that Education Secretary William J.Bennett proposed to reorganize the Institute of Education, the De-partment of Education's research arm, in order, apparently to con-solidate his control over the agency functions. nother motive was ascribed by the Washington Post, \". .. toplacate members of the New Right, who have long demanded that the NIE be abolished be-cause of what they see as its liberal tilt.\" 57 As discussed below acomplex interplay of purposes is probable here.In addition, constraints on social research were reflected in theactions taken by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Ad-ministration of the Department of Health and Human Services, in1982, which, after absorbing a series of budget cuts for fiscal years1981 and 1982, redefined its mission from the support of \"social sci-ence research\" to the support of \"behavioral science research.\" Ac-cording to an observer this means \". ..it has explicitly distanced itself from the 'support of studies of large scale social conditions orproblems,' and intends to confine itself instead to studies that areexplicitly focused on mental illness or mental health. . ..\" 58 55 The views of some of the major OSTP participants in these budget decisions are summarized in.

In general, as of 1984, most funding levels were about 8 percent below the 1930 level even when corrected for inflation. According to a study published in 1984, actual cutbacks for data collection activities have occurred in the Health Care Financing Adminiitration; the Federal Trade Commission; the Office of Research Statistics and International Policy in the Social Security Administration; the Statistics of income Division of the Internal Revenue Service; the Centers for Disease Control; the National Institutes of Health; the Office of Policy Development and Research in the Department of Housing and Urban Development; the Employment and Training Adminis-tration in the Department of Labor; the Bureau of Industrial Eco-nomics, previously in the Department of Commerce; the Civil Aero-nautics Board; the Interstate Commerce Commission; and the Im-migration and Naturalization Service. Several agencies, which did not have clear-cut social services missions, experienced constant or slightly fluctuating levels: the Veterans' Administration, the Na- tional Science Foundation, and the National Highway TrafficSafety Board. Increases were experienced by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Admin-istration. As noted above the office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation in the HHS experienced a 75 percent budget cut over the period fiscal years, 1980 to 1986. a 32It has been concluded that these cLabacks have hurt the reliabil-ity of some statistics, since there have been cuts in sample sizes,the scope of questions asked, and in the data analyses conducted.59N. RATIONALE FOR REAGAN ADMINISTRATION-INSTITUTED BUDGETCUTSIt has been suggested that the Reagan Administration's acceler-ated cuts for these kinds of research may have resulted from as-sessments that some federally-funded behavioral and social scienceresearch were not productive and were not contributing much topolicymaking.6\u00b0 However, according to some analyses, two otherinterrelated factors may be of at least equal force: the need toreduce budget deficits and the Administration's concept of justifi-able Government roles and functions.On the need to reduce budget deficits, The Office of Managementand Budget, in an April 19E1 document entitled Additional Detailson Budget Savings, explained that reductions made in funding forsome behavioral and social research occurred because \"the supportof these sciences is considered of relatively lesser importance to theeconomy than the support of the natural sciences.\" (Fundingtrends for the social sciences have not kept pace with funding forother scientific disciplines. For the period FY1980-FY1986, fundingdecreased about 20 percent for social sciences but increased theother sciences as follows: life sciences, up 44 percent; physical sci-ences, up 52 percent; environmental sciences, up 4 percent; mathe-matical sciences, up lt34 percent; and engineering, up 25 per-cent.) 61Some social scientists view the cuts as ideologically-motivated aswell. For example, two social scientists concluded: \"The ReaganAdministration's budget cutting ...reflects two distinct impulses: a mainstream Republican desire simply to curtail governmentspending and a conservative desire not only to cut spending in gen-eral but also to defund the Left by eliminating especially those pro-grams it regards as the basic source of liberal and radical socialchange in the United States.\"62 Several other authors have delvedinto this issue. Wells alleged that \"although only general instruc-tions were given to various OMB offices on budget levels for hun-dreds of programs, [David] Stockman [first director of OMB underRonald Reagan] issued detailed, specific 'guidance' on reducing oreliminating social and behavioral research in the NSF and otheragencies.\"63 Himmelstein and Zald maintain that conservative op- 59 Griffith, Jeanne E.

They catalogued numerous alleged examples.64 Also,there were allegations that the Administration has staffed some of the social research organizations with \"sympathizers\" of the RightWing, and that this has hurt social research programs.\"It should also be pointed out that the Administration may have determined that cuts were warranted because of the lack of qualityand utility of some behavioral and social science research. See chapter IX of this report.0. THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FUNDINGThese changes, in funding appear to have had a range of effects. These developments led to cutbacks in the success rates of propos- als in many areas of behavioral and social research, to smallersized awards,66 and to the termination of support for some kinds of cause and effect studies, in favor of studies that are quantitative innature or oriented to enhancing databases. F. Thomas Juster, pro- fessor of economics at the University of Michigan and director ofits Institute for Social Research, identified some long range nega- tive impacts for the behavioral and social sciences:Whatever the reasons may be for the Administration'snegativism about basic research in the social and behavior-al sciences, I believe they disregard the long-term conse- quences ... for society: a lengthy period of minimal sup-port will have a significant impact on the inflow of new talent; it will significantly reduce increments to the stockof knowledge that forms an information base for politicaldecisions; it will seriously impede the development of new ideas that are relatively expensive and cannot get a hear- ing in a tightly constrained budget environment; and itwill cause retrogression in the degree to which the behav-ioral and social sciences became more solidly grounded inempirical knowledge and thus become more useful to pol-icymakers.67The cutbacks also precipitated certain developments, which may ultimately have had a pro-social science effect on subsequent con- gressional decision-making and may have the potential to improveunderstanding of the behavioral and social sciences.One is the recognition that social scientists need to demonstratetheir worth and need to be preparet: to lobby to secure funds to prove the merits of their claim on the public purse, just as othersdo. This is reflected in the creation of the Consortium of Social Sci-ence Associations (COSSA), in 1981. COSSA is a lobbying arm ofthe professional social science associations. It both mounted andmarshalled an extensive information dissemination and lobbyingeffort by universities and associations to influence Congress direct-ly and to increase communications between behavioral and social 64 Himmelstein and Zald, op. cit., passim.\" Kirkpatrick, Samuel A., Social Science Research Under Siege.

In addition, it has identifiedand obtained witnesses for hearings and developed seminars andbriefings to describe to politicians the accumulated contributions ofbehavioral and social research to understanding in areas relevantto public policy. This is a new type of lobbying organization withinthe field of social science policy, since it represents, for the firsttime, the building of a consensus and representation of a unifiedvoice by scientists, who hold differing and conflicting views aboutthe needs of their disciplines.\"A related group is the Federation of Behavioral, Psychological,and Cognitive Sciences, a coalition of behavioral scientists, whichhas participated in similar activities. In addition, the AmericanPsychological Association increased its activities to provide itsmembers and members of Coi.gress with policy-relevant informa-tion of mutual interest, via the establishment of a \"Research Net-work,\" which circulates testimony, information, and requests forlobbying to members of the American Psychological Association.\"These groups have held congressional briefings, breakfasts, andseminars on such issues as aging, education, social science contri-butions to innovation, television violence and children, and humanfactors in military R and D. The American Sociological Associationestablished a Commission on Sociology and Society in January1984.7\u00b0 The Commission supports research intended to study thehistory of several major social policy initiatives \"to illustrate howreliance on the sociological perspective might have contributed tobetter formulation and execution of established social programs.\"One visible effect of these activities is that some social and be-havioral scientists, stressing the contributions of these disciplinesto technological innovation and productivity, have supported theinclusion of behavioral and social sciences research among theareas eligible for corporate research tax credits in legislation whichwould make permanent the R and D tax credit provisions of theEconomic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, P.L. 97-34, which expired inDecember 1985. However, some social and behavioral scientists donot support expansion of the tax credit to their disciplines.Also the National Science Foundation awarded funds to the Na-tional Academy of Sciences to enable social and behavioral scien-tists to initiate a study of priorities for funding. See chapter VII.The National Science Board, which helps govern the NationalScience Foundation (NSF) apparently had not been asked its opin-ion before OMB imposed cuts on .the NSF behavioral and social sci-ences programs.71 In June 1981, shortly after the Administration \"See especially.

THE MAJOR FIELDS OF BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIALSCIENCESThis chapter describessome of the major fields of federally sup- ported behavioral and social research focussing on those for which the National Science Foundation collects funding data 1 and identi- fies their principal agency supporters. Refer to Table 6 and Chart C for funding details. For a more technical and detailed discussion of the fields of behavioral and social science, see the relevant sections of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research: A National Resource and the haemational Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences.2 A de- tailed discussion of Federalagency programs appears in Chapter Vof this study.A. ANTHROPOLOGYThe science of anthropology aims to explain human physical and cultural variation at different times and in different locales. This field of study grew out of methods of natural history and empha- sizes field work and understanding of the interaction between humans and their environment. Physical anthropologists \".. trace the evolution of the human species through the recovery and interpretation of fossil remains.\" Cultural anthropologists study patterns of human living and community structures. Cross-cultural comparisonu enable anthropologists to study how cultures and soci-1 NSF divides the fields of psychological and social science, as follows: Psychology deals with behavior, mental processes, and individual and group characteristics end abilities. Psychology is divided into three categories: biological sweets, social aspects, and psychological sciences not elsewhere classified. Examples of disciplines under each of these fields are as follows: Biological aspects: experimental psychology, aLimal behavior, clinical psychology, comparative psychology, ethology. Social aspects.. social psychology, educational, personnel, voca- tional psychology, and testing, industrial and enE,;..z.sering psychology; development and person- ality, .psychological sciences, n.e.c.Social sciences are directed toward an understanding of the behavior of social institutions and groups and of individuals as members of a group. These sciences include anthropology, econom- ics, political science, sociology, and social sciences not elsewhere classified. Examples of disci- plines under each of these fields are as follows: Anthropology: archaeology; cultural; social and ethnology; applied statistics; history of eco- nomic thought; economics; industrial, labor, and agricultural economics, nomics; microeconomics; public finance and fiscal policy; theory, :economic systems and develop- ment Political science: area or regional studies; comparative government; history of political ideas; international relations and law; national political and legal systems; political theory; public administration.

These traditional factors may not be understood by people fromdifferent cultures. Anthropologists seek to correct cultural bias andpromote international understanding by helping non-natives \"see\"through natives' eyes. This is illustrated by The Chrysanthemumand the Sword: Patterns of Japanese Culture, a book intended tohelp Westerners grasp the \"worldview\" of the Japanese and widelycredited 'with affecting U.S. occupation policy in the period 1945-1952.4 Other applications of anthropology are found in such areasas resettlement programs, foreign service training, public healthprograms, and forensic identification.Since 1962, federally funded anthropology research has receivedonly limited Federal funding, generally from 3 to 6 percent of theFederal obligations for social research. In fiscal year 1985 it is esti-mated that about $21 million will be obligated for federally sup-ported anthropology research. The Smithsonian and the NationalScience Foundation are the largest agency supporters.The National Science Foundation reported, in 1981, that it pro-vided 95 percent of the Federal Government's support for basic an-thropological research in universities and colleges in the fiscal year1980. The National Institutes of Health funded a small amount ofphysical anthropology research. The Smithsonian and the NationalPark Service fund targeted (that is, applied) anthropological re-search. In 1981, the National Institute of Mental Health fundedalmost five percent of federally supported anthropology, primarilyfor research in social/cultural anthropology. \"Under current OMBrestrictions,\" according to NSF, \"NIMH will no longer be able tosupport significant research in this area.\" In 1980, Annual non-Federal support for anthropological research,\" NSF,was \"...about $1.5 million ...from Thebulk is from the National Geographic Society.5B. LINGUISTICSLinguistics is the scientific study of human language. This fieldis divided as follows. The study of syntax focuses on how \"a lan-guage organizes meaningful elements into meaningful groups ac-cording to strictly defined patterns.\" Semantics focuses on howmessages are encoded and interpreted from the patterns. Phoneticsstudies the physical or vocal transmission of messages Biological,psychological, social, and cultural factors also affect language andare studied by linguists.The National Science Foundation created a linguistics supportprogram in 1966.

As of 1981,The National Endowment for the Humanities supportsthe preparation of dictionaries of undescribed languages,which is also an area supported by NSF. NSF and NEHhave shared in the support of some dictionary projects. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Devel-opment ... supports some research in language acquisi-tion. Similarly, the National Institute of Neurological andCommunicative Disorders and Stroke supports some re- search in neurolinguistics and in laboratory phonetics as part of its major mission. The Department of Defensefunds some research in computational linguistics, and pre- viously supported several projects in speech recogni- tion.... The National Institute of Education has an in-terest in the support of studies relating to reading.?Support for linguistics is not reported as a separate field of sci- ence in NSF data reports.There is little non-Federal support for research in linguistics. Ac- cording to the National Science Foundation, the Sloan Foundation,\"through its 'Particular Program' in Cognitive Science,\" has sup- ported some work, but it is oriented to interdisciplinary basic re- search.8The study of linguistics has major implications for machine translation and computational interaction from codes to cyphers.C. ECONOMICSThe study of economics focuses on decisionmaking relating to the allocation of scarce resources, especially in relation to the produc- tion of various commodities and their distribution and consumptionin society.\u00b0 There are two levels of analysis in economics. Microeco-nomics looks at assumptions, behaviors, and preferences of econom- ic agents in relation to supply and demand of commodities. Macro- economics... concerns the study of entire economies and involvesaggregating or averaging individual units into came kind of total level of a society's employment, imestment, na- tional income, and so on. Macroeconomics 'studies the regu- larities in the movement and relations among these aggre- gated totals.'\u00b0The focus of current fundamental work in economics is on. deci- sionmaking under uncertainty and the resulting behavior of the economic system; the formation of expectations regarding futurestates of the economy and their impact on public policy interven-tions; and the tool-building activities in the mathematical formula- 7 Ibid., p. 13.Ibid., p. 13.9 See McAdams, Robert, et al eds.

(The categorysocial sciences, NEC receives more, but this represents interdisci-plinary work and other single-discipline projects for which a sepa-rate field has not been assigned.) In the fiscal year 1985, economicswas estimated to have been obligated about 33 percent of all Feder-al social science research funds and 20 percent of all funds for psy-chological and social research. See table 6. The Department of Ag-riculture has been the single largest agency supporter of economicsresearch each year.The National Science Four - cation, however, plays an importantrole in economics research. In 1981 the National Science Founda-tion supported about 70 percent all Federal funding for basic eco-nomics in universities and colleges,\" which it typically has donefor many years.D. GEOGRAPHY AND REGIONAL SCIENCEGeographers describe, analyze, and explain the locations of thehuman and physical features of the earth. Research focuses on whylocational decisions are made and the consequences for the socio-economic activities and the interactions and interconnectionsamong places and regions. This work is interdisciplinary since itstudies the decisions of people, firms, and institutions and the geo-graphic organization of society, land use, and economic activity.Principal topics of current research include: migration and regionalpopulation change; locational decisionmaking by households andindastrialista; cause and consequences of regional growth and de-differences in resource use and geographical aspects of thephysical environment; methods for geographic analysis; and the de-velopment anti ase of geographic information system -. Practicalproblem-, studied include patterne of ent.rgy consun.. geographical/vpiderniological basis of disease.Applications of .'xis discipline are important also ia military andforeign policy and in earth sciences. The NSF plays a dominantrole in gcography ft -ding by supporting over 90 percent of thebasic research in the discipline.'4E.

In many respects the agenda of sociology reflects society's values and prob- lems. Sociologists often deal with a series of complex organizational factors and kinds of relationships which require use of statistical techniques, bodies of longitudinal data, and complex models of social and economic systems.Annual Federal support for sociology in the early 1970s totaled, on the average, two to three times more than annual support levels in the 1960s. This was due probably to support for applied social problem research. Support levels started to decrease in the mid 1970s. In 1974, Federal funding totaled $102 million. Funding de- creased about $40 million to $64 million in 1975 and has fluctuated about $10 million up or down from that figure since then. See table 6.The single largest supporters of sociology in the government are the Department of Health and Human Services (primarily for work in ADAMHA, and basic social program oriented work) and the Na- tional Science Foundation.F. MEASUREMENT METHODS AND DATA BASESThe early reluctance of policymakers to support social and psy- chological sciences in the National Science Foundation, because of the potential for controversy,was mitigated, in part, by the early and continuing emphasis NSF placed on the support of quantifiable or quantitative social and behavioral research studies. (See ChapterII in this study.) One result is the development of substantial and pivotal NSF programs to support the creation of data bases and methodologies to enhance quantitative procedures ane statistical analysis of these data.\" According to Otto Larsen, a senior advisor on social and behavioral sciences at the National Science Founda-tion:The instruments used by social and behavioral scientistsara of the following principal types: science data bases;computing resources; and laboratory equipment. The ex- penses incurred in doing field research, which are essen- tial to some disciplines,are the equivalent of instrumenta-tion expenditures in other sciences. The most important social science counterparts to the instruments used to measure physical phenomena are the scientific data bases.Of these, the most expensive, and the most valuable, are longitudinal data bases in which observations are made with the same survey instruments at a number of points in time.The social and behavioral sciences are especially inten- sive users of computing facilities. At one major American university, for example, social scientists use about 35 per- cent of the total research computing capacity. ...

NSFestimates that by 1973, 50 percent of all graudate students in politi-cal science were receiving their training in quantitative methodsthrough the Inter-University Consortium for Political and SocialResearch, a statistical data analysis center funded by NSF. In addi-tion, NSF reports that \"by 1976, a fair proportion of the methodo-logical articles in the best social and behavioral science journalswere authored by young Ph.Ds who began their research under theaegis of the Mathematical Social Science Board, an adjunct projectof national scope supported by NSF beginning in 1964.\" 17There is no readily available information which describes howmuch support Federal agencies have given to the development ofmethodology and the support of data bases, since the National Sci-ence Foundation does not collect statistics in these categories.There is no doubt however, that the U.S. Government's vast statis-tical framework is a vital part of the information base used byAmerican behavioral and social scientists. Elements of the U.S.Government ina:ntain databases for their own administrative andprogrammatic needs, but these are also used by behavioral andsocial scientists in research. These include certain files of InternalRevenue Service data, Department of Commerce census data,Bureau of Labor Statistics data and National Center for HealthStatistics data, among others.The NSF estimated, in 1983, that it supported 56 researchprojects resulting in the generation or accumulation of data thatcould be used by more than one researcher. Funding comprised 14percent of the social and economics research budget, or $2.7 mil-lion. NSF has supporter' several major data bases called \"nationalfacilities,\" because the o. Anal researcher as well as subsequent re-searchers have access tt,le data for reanalysis and because thedatabase contains nationally representative samples. They andtheir institutional loci are:Panel Study of Family Income Dynamics (Institute for SocialResearch, University of Michigan),National Election Studies (Center for Political Studies, Uni-versity of Michigan),National Time Allocation Data series (Institute for SocialResearch, University of Michigan),Program of Research to Improve the Goverment-GeneratedSocial Science Data Base (American Statistical Association),General Social Survey (National Opinion Research Center),Industrial Change and Occupational Mobility, InternationalData Archives (Social Science Research Council), 16 Larsen, Social and Economic Science, op cit., p. 9-10.17 NSB, Discussion Issues, op. cit, p. 6344. 1 5.2 43Data Archives of the Inter-University Consortium for Pcliti-cal and Social Research (Institute for Social Research, Univer- sity of Michigan),U.S. Quality of Life Survey Series (Survey Research Center, University of Michigan),Computer Research Center for Economic and ManagementScience (Massachusetts Institute of Technology),1940/50 Censuses Public Use Sample Files (Center for De- mography and Ecology, University of Wisconsin),Center for Coordination and Research on Social Indicators (Social Science Research Council), now terminated, and U.S. Manufacturing Establishments Data Base (Department of Economics, Yale University).\"G. POLITICAL. SCIENCEPolitical science focuses on the \"creation, organization, and use of...power.\" 19 In the last twenty years, this field has been influ- enced largely by the behavioral revolution, in that the focus of at- tention has expanded beyond the study of legal statements, formal rules, institutions, and the structural/functional approach to in- clude assessment of processes of human interaction and decisions. Federally supported basic political science also encompasses study of international relations, cross-national comparisons of political at- titudes and institutions, and domestic politics. The National Sci- ence Foundation has, for instance, supported the biennial NationalElection Studies which, since 1952, have generated data bases on citizen attitudes and voting behavior. These, according to NSF, have documented four major changes in the U.S. electorate: (1) A steady decrease in voter turnout; (2) a marked decrease in citizen attachment to political parties; (3) a decline in trust in governmen- tal institutions; and (4) a significant decrease in the competition of Congressional elections.\" 20The field of political science has been among the smallest recipi- ents of Federal funds, never receiving more than about $14 million annually, and more often receiving about $6 to $11 million, usually less than 3 percent of Federal funds awarded for behavioral and social sciences research. NSF has been the largest Federal support- er of fundamental research in this discipline, and, it reports, haveprovided the bulk of Federal support to universities for basic re- search support in political science. The NSF appears to be the single largest clearly identifiable supporter of political science re- search Other major supporters over time have been the Depart- ment of Defense and AD .21H.

After expenditures for social programsand related social sciences research began to increase, the propor-tion of the total that went to psychology dropped to an average ofsomewhere between 30 and 40 percent in the 1970s. There is someindication that the proportion of funding going to the psychologicalsciences has increased in the last few yearsto 39 percent in 1985.In current dollars, the Reagan administration did not cut fundingfor the psychological sciences as it did foxsocial sciences. However,support for psychological sciences used to be about evenly dividedbetween basic and applied, but now is moving more toward applied.The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is thelargest agency supporter of psychological sciences research, aboutevenly divided between support for basic and applied psychologicalsciences. The next largest single agency supporter is the DefenseDepartment (DOD), where the bulk of psychological sciences re-search support funding (60 to 70 percent) goes to the support of ap-plied research programs. DHHS's psychological sciences programsare intended to advance understanding in the mission areas of dis-ease prevention and control and the behavioral aspects of develop-ment and social interaction. DOD's programs are intended to sup-port primarily personnel, training, and related activities.The National Science Foundation's programs support memoryand cognitive processee learning, thought, memory retention, ynn-cept formation, arrri.,mation, reading, problem-solving, decis'onmaking and intelligence. These research programs also are rele-vant to the imp:ovement of computer usage and artificial intelli-gence. According to NSF, the NSF funds about one-fourth of Feder-al support for basic research in human cognition in colleges anduniversities. The other agencies, which fund about 75 percent offederally funded research on this topic, are the National Instituteof Mental Health, the National Institutes of Health, the Office ofNaval Research, and the National Institute of Education. Their re-search is mission-oriented, while NSF's is more basic research ori-ented. According to NSF, \"the chief non-Federal supporter of cogni-tive science ...is the Sloan Foundation; its support is to institu-tions to help them develop a group of researchers with interdisci-plinary training. Support of specific research projects is specificallyexcluded.

PSYCHOBIOLOGYPsychobiology research is interdisciplinary to the extent that it focuses on \"some aspect of behavior and its environmental, devel- opmental, hormonal, and/or motivational determinanTs.\" 24 A sample list of topics includes \"Migration and homing, the social and commmicative behavior of animals, feeding and reproductive behaviors, animal preferences and aversions, learning andmemory, conditioning, and stimulus control.\" 25NSF's support program is the largest of any governmentalor nongovernmental agency according to the National Science Board. Most of the work is conducted in academic institutions and other nonprofit institutions, suchas zoos, research institutes, and muse- ums.262. SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGYResearch in social psychology is intended to describe systematic social behavior in humans, including such topics as \"helping and aggression... leadership and conformity . .. [and] changes in social and emotional behavior occurring over the entire life span.\" The National Science Foundation, according to the National Sci- ence Bond, funds about 25 percent of federally supported research in social psychology. This report also noted that there are virtually no non-Federal sources of support for this discipline.About 10 percent of federally funded research in developmental psychology comes from NSF. According tc the National Science Foundation, about 10 percent of research in developmental psychol- ogy is funded by non-Federal sources, including especially the Grant Foundation and the Foundation for Child Development.27I. SOCIAL SCIENCES, NOT ELSEWHERE CLASSIFIEDThe National Science Foundation also uses a reporting category of social sciences not elsewhere classified, which includes interdisci- plinary project.? and work in fields of social sciences not separately identified.\" This constitutes the largest reported category of fund- ing for most recent years for the social sciences. It has included much of the inter-disciplinary and problem-oriented research in HITS and in other social mission oriented agencies and the Nation- al Science Foundation (especially the now terminated RANN pro- gram). The lack of differentiation into categories makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the kind of work which is encompassed in this category. 24 Ibid., p. 23.22 Ibid.$ Ibid., p. 26\" Ibid., p. 32.2$ U.S. National Science Foundation Federal Funds for Research and Development.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEWThis chapt-r addresses the task force's request for an examina- tion of \"the extent to which the distinction between basic and ap- plied research applies to the social and behavioral sciences.\" This is an extremely complex subject with no easy distinctions, but with implications for Federal funding for research and utilization of re- search results.The discussion in this chapter summarizes some of the major lit- erature and thinking on this subject. It deals primarily with the be- havioral and social sciences. It should be noted, however, that the dilemma of making explicit and valid distinction between basic and applied research exists in all scientific disciplines. There is a continuing debate about whether there are meaning- ful distinctions between basic and applied behavioral and social re- search.' The material in this chapter begins by noting thatmany behavorial and social scientists say that basic and applied research should not be differentiatedas much as they ar.. because research-ers use the same methodological techniques to do basic as applied r. =earth. For scientists there is no distinction as to what consti- tutes scientifically acceptable evidence whether one is doing basic or applied research. Indeed, many scientists believe that basic and applied research are nota dichotomy, but are more like end-pointson a continuum of research activities. End-points can be distin- guished on some criteria such as goals or generality but not others (scientific methods or rigor). An important issue, scientists state, is that of application. Both basic and applied science have applica- tions, and applied science often generates questions that require basic research. Others hold that basic research generally is re- search done without any immediate application in mind; the re- searcher's curiosity and heror his conception of the internal crite-ria of science, that is, scientific needs, determine the pipose and kind of research. Applied research, on the other hand, some say, is intended to serve thepurpose of the client that funded it; externalcriteriathat is societal values and needs and the requirements of the clientplay a major role in designing the work and methodolo- gy. Some attribute the distinction between basic and applied re- search to the presumption that applied research is more influenced by social values than is basic research, exacerbated since these \"soft sciences\" (of behavioral and social research) axe more influ- enced by values thanare the \"hard\" sciences. This view, some argue, is fallacious. This debate occurs also in other fields of science, such as chemistry, physics, and biology.(47)56 48While there are compelling arguments in support of the view ofthe unity of basic and applied behavorial and social research, thereare equally compelling, perhaps more persuasive, arguments thatbasic and applied research in these disciplines are different. This isreflected in the views of some scientists who believe that basic andapplied research in these disciplines requires different skills andknowledge bases and has different applications and implications fortraining and public policy. Some believe that improving utilizationof these sciences requires that the status of applied research beraised in the minds of researchers and policymakers. There arealso other differences reflected in the way the Government fundssuch research, reports funding data about it, and develops policyfor it.A related and often overlooked issue is that of identifying feder-ally supported development and dissemination in the social and be-havioral sciences and collecting funding information about them,since they are such important and large parts of Federal supportfor behavioral and s\"rial research.B.ARGUMENTS IN Si, PORT OF THE SDAILARITY BETWEEN BASIC ANDAPPLIED RESEARCHSome behavioral and social scientists believe that differentiatingbetween basic and applied behavioral and social research is unwiseand an artificial distinction. For instance, according to the Nation-al Research Council's Study Project on Social Research and Devel-opment, the categories of basic and applied research which are tra-ditionally used in Government reports on science funding andpolicy \"... seem to reflectperception of the physical sciences andtechnological R&D, and are difficult to make in the behavioral andsocial sciences.2 (Thus the project reported funding for the categoryof research, but also reported funding expenditures under othercategories not customarily used to report funding for science. Seechapter 5 for more details.) For instance, according to one socialscientist, Donald E. Stokes, chairman of the National Academy ofSciences Study Project on Social Research and Development, in1978:A commonplace in every field of science is the sight of adiscomfited observer trying to distinguish basic from ap-plied research. Indeed, the sight is so familiar that itshould long ago have convinced us that something iswrong, that we are as likely to find a single, clear distinc-tion between basic and applied research as we are to findthe philosopher's stone, and that we ought to redefine theterms in which the problem is posed.3 2 Abramson, Mark A.

Making Sense of the Basic/Applied Distinction Lessons for the PublicPohrPrograms. Prepared for delivery at the meeting for the Association for Public PolicyAnalysis and Management. Chicago, Ill., Oct. 10, 1979. Stokes offered the following new concep-tualization of types of research. the difference [between basic and applied research] involves not one distinction but two. Each of the paired concepts of 'basic' and applied' is a type in itsown right. ... 'basic' [means] whether the research probes underlying structures or processes 516 49According to Stokes, basic and applied research are not two oppo- site ends of a spectrum of research, since basic research always has the potential of application, and research done to solvea specific problem always has the potential of moving toward understanding of underlying structures, without necessarily losing its problem focus. He gave examples of these two cases. With respect to apply- ing basic research he reported:A particularly vivid example is furnished by the discov- ery by demographers after the Second World War that they could use the models of population replacement devel- oped between the wars tosee more deeply into populationchanges in the less developed countries. (Notestein, 1980.) The case is interesting because the earlier work had almost literally been forgotten. Soon after the First World War, Lotka did the fundamental work modelling the proc- esses by which biological populations reproduce them- selves, spelling out the relationships between fertility, mo- rality, growth, and age. But the early use of these models seemed to lead to empiricalcontradictions, and they fell into disuse before the end of the Second World War. Yet it was seen after the war that the relationships within these models provided the key that allowed demographers to work from limited information on the less developed coun-tries to a far better understanding of their fertility and population growth.This understanding has allowed our own government, the governments of the third world, and a number of inter- national agencies to recognize and deal with the problem of population growthon a global scale.4As an example of applied research leading to accumulations of fundamental knowledge, he cited:An example is furnished bythe research on highway safety over several recent decades. As the concern with highway deaths grew,a considerable body of descriptivestatistics accumulatedon the frequency, severity, and cir-cumstances of traffic accidents. [This was applied work.] But explanatory questionscame more and more to the foreas it was seen that the choice of effective ameliorative measures. in this notoriously multi-factor problem area, required a deeper knowledge of cause. This awarenessof broad explanatory or predictive significance .'applied' [means] whether it is prompted by the desire to solve some problem or meet some societal need .... It will help to visualize this double dichotomy if we map these several types onto the cells of a four-fold table:Applied Not appliedBasicProblem solving through basic un IIPure understanding I derstanding.Not ''asicProblem description, knowledge ap III[Research projects undertaken as IV plication. training or as a form of \"distnb-utive politics\").Types I and III in Stoke's table fit the common idea that basic and applied research are oppo- site to each other; these cells are basic, not applied and applied, not basic. Type II basic and applied, is more closely related to mission-oriented basic research (idem.)\" Ibid. p. 4-5. 50prompted a aeries of studies of the engineering and behav-ioral etiology of accident that raised at times such funda-mental questions as the reasons for the greater resistanceto social control early in the life cycle. But these studieswere powerfully motivated by the applied purpose of find-ing points for effective intervention to counter the trend ofmounting highway deaths.\"5 'In a 1969 National Academy of Sciences report on Behavioraland Social Sciences: Outlook and Needs it was concluded that bothbasic and applied research may have applicationsThe objectives of behavioral and social scientists are es-sentially the same as those of other scientists: to establisha body of fact and theory, demonstrable and communica-ble, that contributes to knowledge and understanding thatwill permit man to manage his affairs with greater ration-ality. The individual scholar becomes fascinated with aknown area that he is prepared to explore; this becomesan exciting intellectual quest, and his contribution movesthe body of knowledge ahead, thus serving the purposes ofeducation and the broadening of understanding, whetheror not there is any immediate application to human af-fairs. Others, however, do their investigating in the tur-moil of life as it is lived, in the hope that they may devel-op insights that can be used promptly. These distinctionsbetween basic and applied social science are seldom sharp,and important scientific contributions can be made allalong the line, with applied findings serving basic sciencejust as basic science serves applications.6\"What is frequently, if misleadingly, called 'applied social sci-ence\", according to Prewitt, \"is but a small part of the applicationof social science.\" 7Some work intended to be applied \". .. canbe highly fundamen- tal in character in that it has an important impact on the concep-tual structure or outlook of a field.\" In testimony on this pointbefore the House Committee on Science and Technology, forme:NSF Director John B. Slaughter cited several examples of appliedbehavioral and social science ret.aarch which \"led to major contri-butions in basic knowledge.\" He cited aptitude testing, the develop-ment of opinion and moral work in World War II, which led to TheAmerican Soldier, a methodologically sophisticated study, and theWestern Electric studies, which led to definition of thb HawthorneeffectsThe implication of this view, for funding, is that \"research onbasic problems can be solved only by enlarging our basic under- 6 Ibid., p. 5-6.6 The Behavioral and Social Sciences.

One is the concept of \"mission oriented basic research.\" For instance, Kenneth Prewitt, as Presi- dent of the Social Science Research Council, defined this as \"re- search in which practial concerns guide the choice of research itopics, but which is conducted in ways which h, ye no immediate or directly foreseeable applications.\" 10The general field in whicha scientist chooses or is as- signed to work may be influenced by possible or probable applicability, even though the detailed choices of direction may be governed wholly by internal scientific criteria. Re-search of this type is sometimes referred to as \"oriented basic research.\" Much biomedical research is of this char- acter. ...11C. THE IMPACT OF VALUES ON BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCHSome believe that the behavioral and social sciences are inher- ently applied and value-laden to begin with because their subject is human behavior and the problems humans confront in dealing with each other and with their environment. For instance, often it is acknowledged that social history, and thus societal values, have influenced the shape of basic research priorities, \"schools of thought,\" and approaches to the study of the behavioral and social sciences. This is exemplified in an analysis by James Coleman, about the rise and decline of the \"Chicago school\" of sociology under Robert Park, and its replacement as a dominant intellectual force by Paul Lazarsfeld and the Columbia School. The former con- centrated research effortson immigration, urban life, and the as-similation of outsidersor the \"marginal man\"into urban socie- ty. As large waves of early twentieth century immigration ceased, and the issue of national methods of communication and the influ- ence of the dissemination of the national media came to be an im- portant social force, the Columbia school of sociology, which stud- ied these new issues, becamea dominant intellectual force in soci- ology. Subsequent social prescoires helped to define the shape and objects of social research and led to new \"schools of social re- search,\" reflecting new social trends. These included the post World WFr II claims of blacks and other disenfranchised groups to full particApation in society, a 3 \"Great Society Legislation\" (with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Elementary and Secondary Educa- tion Act of 1965, the creation of the Office of Economic Opportuni- ty, the Headstart program, and Medicare). In the 1970s, such fac- tors included the spurt of safety and environmental regulation, with attendant calls for sccial impact assessment, which resulted In the development of a \"school\" of social policy research to do Gov.9 Ibid., P. 8-9.\" Social Science Research Council.

Societal events or pressures appear, for instance,to have influenced such research priorities in the natural and phys-ical sciences as cancer, AIDS, nuclear weapons production, andlaser-based space defensive weapons.Thomas Kuhn, a leading philosopher of science, has been quotedas saying that societal values and historical events influence theearly stages of development of all fields of science:...social needs and values are a major determinant ofthe problems on which its practitioners concentrate. Alsoduring this period the concepts they deploy in solvingproblems are extensively conditioned by contemporarycommon sense, by a prevailing philosophical tradition, orby the most prestigious contemporary sciences.' 3Internal criteria (of science), rather than external criteria (thatis, societal values), become more important determinants of re-search priorities, according to Kuhn, after a science has becomemature:,Practitioners of a mature science are people, Kuhn con-tinues ...trained in a sophisticated body of traditionaltheory and of instrumental, mathematical, and verbaltechnique. As a result, they constitute a special subculture,one whose members are the exclusive audience for, andjudges of, each other's work. The problems on which suchspecialists work are no longer presented by the externalsociety but by an internal challenge to increase the scopeand precision of the fit between existing theory andnature. And the concepts used to resolve these problemsare normally close relatives of those supplied by prior training for the specialty. In short, compared with otherprofessional and creative pursuits, the practitioners ofmature science are effectively insulated from the cultural milieu in which they live their extra-professional lives(118-119).1412According to Col.inan \"it is interesting that researchers and research organizations whogrew up in one research tradition are often unable to accommodate to the new patterns of re-search, despite attempts. For example ... the Chicagoschool attempted to carry the ideas ofsymbolic interactionism into the new setting Me there was little interest in this work, becauseit was done in the old mode, with indifferen[ce] to its use in actions of interested parties. Simi-larly, many sociologists who began their careers in ths 1950s with researther-initusted projectsfunded by grants or with small market research or mass communications projects have beenunable to accommodate to the new structure of policy research with tighter controls in an orga-nizational context. At Columbia, the Bureau of Applied Social Research, organized . .. [to con-duct research on communications] of the Columbia school era, was unable to make the transi-tion to policy research and finally closed shop.\" (Coleman, James. S.

However, Kuhn'snotion doei lead to the possible implication that the behavioral andsocial sciences, as newer sciences than the natural and physcial sci-ences, may be more influenced by societal values. At the sametimei it cannot be denied that ,all sciencesnatural, physical, be-havioral, and socialare influenced by societal b.clahns ofpotential application)_ regardless of their maturi-ty, to. the extent that tests, of significance, used in all sciences,depend on values and judgments about the degree of acceptablecosts and risks 'the scientist and society are willing to accept.

ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE NOTION THAT APPLIED RESEARCHSHOULD BE DIFFERENTIATED FROM BASIC RESEARCHAlthough, there are compelling arguments in favor of not differ-entiating clearly between basic and applied research in the behav-ioral and social sciences, there are equally compelling, if not morepersuasive, views that basic research can be distinguished from ap-plied research. Harvey Brooks, a scholar of science policy, re-marked, for instance, that the extent to which a researcher relieson internal or external criteria are determinants of whether behav-ioral and social research is basic or applied:Research ishest regarded as a continuing process involv-ing a series of contingent choices by the researcher. Eachtime he, decides between alternative courses of action, the 15 In greater detail, Ravetz explained. \"Each component of the argument of a solved problem,either an.inferencelink or a piece of evidence, can be no more than adequate to its function inthe total,structure, and what is 'adequate' will depend not merely on its context in the problem,but on the general criteria of adequacy for the class of such problems imposed by the community..I,An example of the necessity of judgments udgments of adequacy4is] in the discussions of the 'soundness' of data, and ,of the 'reliabilit , and 'relevance'of information. An appreciation of what is involved in such judgments may gained from a consideration of a common and rou- tine prOcedure in the formtitaon of such judgments: a statistical significance test. For statisticsdo not simply say, that a correlation is 'significant' or not significant; rather, they will speak ofsignificance at a certain level. Those,who have any craft skill in the use of such tools will appre-ciate,that the significance leVel to be adopted is not assigned by God, but must be decided by theuser. The decision will be based on estimates of the direct costs and the risks associated witheach level. For each level of significance involves the poesibility of two sorts of error: of rejectingworthwhile information, or of allowing dubious information to pass. The more stringent the testchosen, the safer; but also .the more costly, because of the extra time, care, the resources re-quired for producing material ,that will pass it. The choice of a particular level of significancemust depend on a judgment of what degree of safety is required, for that component in its con-text in the total problem. And this judgment must be based on general criteria of adequacy ap-plied to that particular situation. There can be no perfectly safe test of the quality of the mate-rial, and neither can there be a certainly correct decision on the degree of stringency of the test.( Ravetz, Jerome R.

If each choice is in-'fluencedsalmost entirely by the conceptual structure of thesubject rather than by the ultimate utility of the results,;then the. research is generally said to be basic or funda-mental, even though.the general subject may relate to pos-sible-applications and may be funded with this in mind.The fact- that research is basic ,does not mean that she re-sults lack utility, 'but only that utility is not the primaryfactor in the clnice 'of direction for each successive step.\"rtRobert K.

And he-gave asan example of a useful prototype, an Office of Social Research,under, the direction of the sociologist, John W. Riley, Jr., estab-lished by the'Equitable Life Assurance Society in the 1960s.\"Compelling argunients have been made to maintain a clearcutdifferentiation between basic and applied behavioral and social re-search, with respect to funding and expectations of researchoutput, in order to proteCt the future of these kinds of research.

Rossi, a researcherat the University of Massachusetts, and a past president of theAmerican Sociological Association. They noted the academic dis-dain for doing applied 'social research, an attitude, which, theysaid; should be overcome to \"mitigate the shrinking opportunitiesfor sociologists in the academic labor market.\" Additional researchsupport would flow to these fields if sociologist's work was morerelevant to solving social problems. \". [H]owever, there are qualitative differences between applied and conventional academicwork that need to be confronted, including the educational prepa-ration required, the criteria for student selection, the ways facultyare evaluated; and theof work that are valued.\" 24E. PUBLIC POLICY FACTORS WHICH SUPPORT A DISTINCTION BETWEENBASIC AND APPLIED BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL RESEARCHAlthough there may be objections, it can be postulated that thereare several public policy factors which call for a clear differentia-tion between: basic and applied social and behavioral science re-search. One important factor is the requirement Federal agencieshave to provide information on research funding to the NationalScience Foundation to enable it to fulfill sec. 3(a) (7) of its enablinglegislation, which requires NSF to report annually to the Presidenton various types of expenditures for scientific research.Related to this, many scientists perceive applied research assomehow less important, valuable, scientific, or objective than basicresearch. In the social sciences this perception may derive from thefact that when the National Science Foundation was first created,it was not given an explicit mandate, but rather a permissive man-date, to support the behavioral and social sciences. Gradually basic,quantitative, behavioral and social science research, and some LT-plied research, came to be accepted as a proper and legitimatefields of study, but the legacy and some of the perceptions of socialscience as being nonscientific linger. \" Brooks, Applied Research: Definitions, Concepts, Themes. op. cit., p. 25-26.\" Nathan, Richard P.

New York, Elsevier. p. 5-6, who concluded, based on her review of the role ofsocial scientists in presidential commissions the body of basic science is not likely to address itself to the questions that an applied scientist is called upon to answer, certainly not in a spec&is enough manner. Even when an inference from the existing knowledge appears to provide thesociological consultant with a ready guide to policy, this insight will probably require empiricalvalidation in the concrete context of the problem in question . ... Formulation of policies to eve with social problems will generally require some new research addressed specifically to thequestion at issue. The sociological perspective and existing sociological generalizations willinform the design of this applied research.\"\" Freeman, Howard E. and Peter H. Rossi. Furthering the Applied Side of Sociology. Ameri.can Sociological Review, v. 49, Aug. 1984: 571. 56In 1968-the NSF enabling legislation, was revised to make clear NSF's responsibilities to support.applied, as wellas basic, research, and social science, as well as other disciplines. (P.L. 90-40T.) Until 1981, applied research was supported in a separate NSV division. Pursuant to a 1981 reorganization, the functions of the applied, re- search directorate were located in the relevant research director- itei but policies of balancing basic and applied research and of tracking their funding were maintained. (National Science Founda- tiOn Bulletin No. 81-83..Oct. 16, 1981. Subject: Tracking of Applied Research Support.)In order to provide data essential for describing.Federal support for science, the 'National Science Foundation, in its series Federal Funds for Sciince and, its successor, Federal Funds for Researchand Development, use the categories of basic research, \"applied re- search,\" ana \"development! 25 The validity of this \"trichotomy\"has been criticised as \"uncertain.\" 26 Nevertheless, the conceptuali-. zation appears to have proven valid and internally consistent to policymakers in the thirty-five years during which it has been used.As is indicated in table 2 and chart A, about two-thirds of Feder- al funds for research in the 'behavioral and social sciences have always.,gone to support applied research. This ratio of applied to basic increased considerably in the mid- to late 1970s, when thepercentage increased to about 75 percent going for applied work inthese fields. This trend probably reflects increased expenditures forwork in connection with fine-tuning of social welfare and relatedprograms. The ratio has been about 2.(applied) to 1 (basic) for thebehavioral sciences and 3 to 1 for the social sciences.Most of the behavioral and social research supported by the Gov-ernment is applied research, (oriented to mission needs); and thatwhich is basic, clearly, is supported by agencies whose principalmission is the support of research. Congress uses different kinds of criteria of the \"public good\"related to the intrinsically differentoutcomes expected for basic and applied researchin judging fund-ing objectives in oversight and appropriations hearings for theseagencies.Basic research support programs ,commonly have attached tothem support functions for teaching and student training especiallyin the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes ofHealth and ,ADAMHA agencies. It is not expected that other mis-sion-oriented agencies that support behavioral and social researchwill support training at the same levels. But, it is expected thatGovernment will support training programs in these disciplines.It is also clear that university researchers play an important role in performing basic .social and psychological sciences research for 26 NSF's definitions follow: \"In bask research the objective of the sponsoring agency is to gainfuller knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and of observablefacts without specific applications lowered processes or products in mind. In applied research theobjective of the sponsoring agency is to gain knowledge or understanding necessary for deter.mining the means of which r recognized and specific red mai be met.\" U.S. National ScienceFoundation.

For instance the information in table 7 showsthat for the period fiscal year 1974 to 1986, on average 58 percentof all federally funded basic research in psychology was performedin universities and for the same period, 46 percent of all federallyfunded basic research.in social sciences was performed in universi-ties. The percentage of basic social sciences research performed inuniversities has been declining. For the period 1974 to 1979, univer-sities conducted about 53 percent of all federally funded basicsocial sciences research; that declined to 40 percent during theperiod 1980 to 1985.

Ever since the Federal establishment for supporting sciencewas erected following World War II, there has been a clear-cutGovernment policy to strengthen and advance U.S. university re- search capabilities to provide a manpower pool and knowledge baseto \u00b0meet unexpected national needs and to maintain the pluralistic,diversified system of scientific research which provides the founda-tion for scientific preemience in the United States. Long-range fun-damental basic research in the behavioral and social sciences thatis performed in universities undoubtedly contributes to the scien-tific excellence of this Nation.Some believe that market forces and Federal research fundingpatteins are driving new researchers in these fields away from basic and toward applied research. (As noted above the bulk of Fed-eral funding for these disciplines is for applied research.) Thesemay have affected enrollment patterns and career choices, andmay constrain the size of the pool of basic research scientists in thefuture.28 However, such trends may be appropriate responses tothe policies that have been instituted in the last few years for thesefields of science.The support of essential basic research that generates fundamen-tal knowledge but that may not have an immediate payofffor in-stance, support of NSF's longitudinal data collection and databases,,that allow for replication and sharing of resourceshas beendetermined to be a proper governmental function. A blurring of thedistinction between basic and applied research might jeopardizethis kind of responsibility and cloud Federal mechanisms and pro-cedures to determine priorities for the support of the sciences.Policy makers' needs for data that describe funding and supportprograms for basic and applied research seems essential to enablethem to design policies to meet goals they seek to achieve for thesefields.The Task Force may wish to consider whether policies and pro-grams should be established to collect statistics on the conduct of\"development and related activities\" in the behavioral and socialsciences. As is pointed out, in chapter V, the National Academy ofSciences reported in 1978, that more Federal expenditurtm went tothis other category than to basic and applied research in the be-havioral and social sciences, combined. Expenditures for develop-ment, demonstration, evaluation, and some statistics totaled ap-proximately $1.2 billion. Yet the Government does not collect anyinformation on a recurring basis to describe and inventory theseactivities. 28 Klat:ky, R. L et al. Experimental Psychologists m Industry.

TRENDS IN ii'EDERAL SUPPORT FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES: A SUMMARY AND SYNOPSIS OFFEDERAL AGENCY PROGRAMSThis chapter begins with a summary of recent major historicaltrends in funding for behavorial and social science research andthen gives short summary description of the purposes and fundingof the behavioral and social sciences programs that Federal agen-cies fund.A. MAJOR FUNDING TRENDSThis section on funding trends opens with an analysis of fundingfor behavioral and social sciences research, development, and rea-lated activities made by the National Research Council of the Na-tional Academy of Sciences in 1978. The section then moves on tolook at trends in research funding over time. The major source forthis information is NSF data.'1. FEDERAL EXPENDITURES FOR BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL RESEARCHAND DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED ACTIVITIES ESTIMATED :0 TOTAL $2BILLION ANNUALLY BY THE NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCILFederal obligations for the support of social and behavioral re-search and development and related activities according to the Na-tional Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, to-taled almost $2 billion in fiscal year 1977, or $1,888.8 million to beprecise.2 This included funding for demonstration, all social and be-havioral \"knowledge production and application activities\", includ-ing funds for development and dissemination, categories for whichthe National Science Foundation daP. not customarily report data.3Although no comparable data at available for other fiscal years, there may have been little change in this total since 1977.4This is a large enterprise, aad far greater than the commonlydiscussed level of funding only flr social and behavioral research ' Alternative data describing funding patterns in psychology research. as collected by theAmerican Psychological Association, may be found in.

(StudyProject on Social Research and Development, Assembly of Behavioral and Social Sciencns, National Research Council, Vol. 2.)3 Behavioral research was subsumed in the definition of social R&D. According to the report.\"Social R&D consists of research and development ane related uctivities concerned with understanding and alleviating social problems. It is intendea to in' sde such activities as the producLion or application of knowledge concerning thn beha%lor of ina.viduals, groups, or institutionsor the effects of policies, programs or technologies on behavior.\" t Abramson, op. cit., p. 15JThere is an actual 20 percent decrease in funding for resmch between 1977 and 1985, esti-mated in terms of constant dollars. In terms of current dollars, the incic.nre for the period is 32percent. But research constituted only about one-third of the total reported t4.11977. iSce table 4above.)(59) 60found in statistics published by the National Science Foundation.The NSF estimated that in the fiscal year 1977, Federal obligationsfor behavioral and social research totaled about $582 million. Thefiscal year 1985 estimated total for behavioral and social researchis about $768 million. The 1985 figure is $328 million, in terms of constant 1972 dollars, a 20 percent decrease in constant dollarssince 1977.Although NSF collects data on development, it does not reportfunding for development by field of science; therefore, \"field of sci-ence\" data are available only for research.The National Research Council (NRC) inventory is important be-cause it conveys the full scope and magnitude of federally support-ed social and behavioral R&D activities in which the Task Force isinterested. In many respects it gives a better representation, thando NSF data, of the kin& of Federal R&D suppor. activities whichemploy social and behavioral scientists or use behavioral and socialknowledge. Most of the funding data used in this report are limited to the NSF-generated information which, it can be estimated withsome confidence, probably comprise only about 30 to 40 percent ofthe total amount of Federal funding for social R&D and related ac- tivities as conceptualized by the National Research Council.The NRC study focused on\"social knowledge production and ap- plication\" activitiesboth behavioral and social. Knowledge pro- duction was defined to include four activities, of which only two are included in NSF data, according to the report. Federal fundingfcr knowledge production activities totaled about $1.2 billion in1977,5 and encompassed the following activities:6(1) Research, which was defined as basic, applied and policyresearch, or \"systematic, intensive study directed toward great-er knowledge or understanding of the subject studied.\" NSFcollects data on this activity. The NRC estimated the fundingfor 1977 between $600 to $700 inillion (the actual funding levelwas $528 million). The largest supporters were the NationalScience Foundation, the National Institute of Education, theAlcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration, andthe National Institutes of Health.(2) Demonstration for policy formulation, which was con- ceived to be \"..a small-scale program undertaken in anoperational setting for a finite penocl of time to test the desir-ability of a proposed course of action.\" Social experiments are included. NSF collects data on this field, but does not report itaccording to field of science. The Academy estimated that in1977 about $200 million, or almost 10 percent of the total, was expended on this area. Clearly identified major supporters in1977 were the Office of Education, the National Institute ofEducation, and the HUD Office of Policy Development and Research.(3) Program evaluations, which were defined as seeking \". .. to systematically analyze federal programs ... to determine the extent to which they have achieved their objectives.\" NSFdoes not collect data on this activity, except for evaluation re- 6 Abramson, op. cit., p. 30.Ibid., p. 15-21. 6.9 61search, not geared to a management decision. The NRC reportestimated that about $64 million, or 3 percent of the total wentto this function in 1977.(4) General purpose statistics, which the Research Councildefined as the collection of \"either current or periodic data [ofsocial, economic, and deniographic topics] with intended andunintended users. NSF does not collect data on funding for sta-tistical activities like this. According to the National ResearchCouncil, approximately $314 or 17 percent of social R&D funding in 1977 went to this category. The largest sup-porter-in 1977 was the Bureau of the Census.Knowledge application consists of three activities which, accord-ing to the Research Council, totaled $611 million, or 32 percent ofthe total obligations in 1977. These activities were:(1) Demonstrations for policy implementation, developmentof materials, and dissemination. A demonstration for policy im-pleinentation was defined as \". .. asmall-scale program un- dertaken in an operational setting for a finite period of time totest the desirability of a proposed course of action.\" NSF doesnot collect data on support of this function. About $179 million,or almost 10 percent of the total, went to this activity in 1977.(2) Development of materials, according to the NRC, consist-ed of the \"...systematic use of knowledge and understandinggained from research to produce materials,\" such as curricu-lum, testing instruments, and training manuals. NSF statisticsinclude funding for this item, which the Research Council esti-mated to have cost $115 million, or 6 percent of the total, in1977.(3) Dissemination accounted for $318 million, or 17 percent ofthe total, in 1977. It was defined as consisting \". .. of activities undertaken by research managers ... to promotethe applica- tion of knowledge or data resulting from social knowledge pro-duction activities.\" NSF does riot collect data on this category.The Extension Service of the Department of Agriculture wasthe largest supporter in 1977.The Academy summarized the functions and support levels ofthe major social knowledge production and application activities in1977 as follows: TABLE 1B.

TRENDS IN NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION DATAa. Decreases in Funding Over TimeNational Science Foundation data on Federal funding for re- search (which are limited to about 40 percent of total funding forbehavioral and social research and development and related activi-ties as reported by the National Research Council) show that Fed-eral support for basic and applied behavioral and social science in-creased as a percentage of total Federal research funding, fromabout 3.9 percent in 1962 to a high of 8 percent in 1971, and thenstarted to decrease steEr.:ily, to about 5 percent estimated in 1985.See Table 10 and Chart D below. The accelerated decrease of about1 percentage point, beginning in 1982, reflects the cuts institutedby the Reagan Administration.

Chart Bshows a decline in terms of constant dollars of support for behav-ioral and social research, starting in 1978. Funding reached a nadirof about $289 million in 1982, and has started a slow rise sincethen, and appears to be stabilizing (at least for 1984 and 1985) atabout $330 million. The important fact to point out, however, is \"Calculated from data in Table B-11, U.S. National Science Fouadatam. Science and Engi-neering Personnel. A National Overview. Washington, U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1985. p. 105-107.NSF 85-302. 73 65that the average constant dollar obligation level for the behavioraland social sciences, at $313 million for the period 1982 to 1985, isabout $40 million or 12 percent lower than the average Federal ob-ligation level for these sciences in terms of real dollars for theperiod 1965 to 1970, the previous \"low level\" funding period. Theonly reasonably accurate trend data that are available which useinternally consistent methods to estimate growth in the number ofscientists annually, are for the period 1970 to 1980. They show thatthe growth in the number of psychologists and social scientists em-ployed in scientific and engineering jobs over this time period was42 percent (from 125,000 in 1970 to 177,000 in 1980).8 During thesame period Federal research funding for these disciplines in-creased about 16 percent in constant dollars.9 A... far as data in thisreport show, the increases iri funding for research from othersources (foundations and industry) do not seem large enough tocompensate for the gap observed in Federal funding. (See ChapterVI.) It seems apparent that the bulk of research done in thesefields is supported by the Federal Government, and this, social andbehavioral scientists argue, makes even more serious their recentcomplaints, (See Chapter X), that decreases in funding will prob-ably continue to be detrimental to the research progress of be- havioral and social sciences disciplines. (Seventeen percent morebehavioral and social scientists were employed in industry in 1980than in 1970, but there is no information to show how much moreresearch support industry has given to these fields over time.)\"b. Federal Support Patterns Favor Social Science Researcl and Ap-plied ResearchFederak support for applied behavioral and social sciences re-search has always exceeded basic research support in these fields ofscience. The ratio of support appears to have remained constantover the last thirty years at about 2 to 1 for applied to basic re-search support in psychology, and at the ratio of about 3 to 1 forapplied to basic support in the social sciences. See Table 2. Thelargest supporters of basic research in the behavioral sciences havebeen the National Science Foundation, in the Department ofHealth and Human Services (in the Alcohol, Drug Abuse andMental Health Administration), and the Department of Defense.The Department of Health and Human Services supports about 60percent of federally supported basic psychology and social sciencesresearch in universities. NSF, HHS, and the Department of Agri-culture have been the largest supporters of social sciences research.See Table 11. The Department.; of Labor, Justice, Education, andthe Smithsonian Institution ako play important roles in supportingsocial sciences research.In addition, Federal support for social sciences has always ex-ceeded Federal support for psychology research, but the differencein proportions grew larger over time until, in 1982, behavioral sci-ences research started to increase as a proportion of the whole. 9 Table B-1.

BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH, BY SELECTEDFEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, 1945-1984This section summarizes the behavioral and social sciences re-search support pi ograms of major Federal agencies in the postWorld War II period. Agencies covered, in order, are: the NationalScion?,e Foundation; the Department of Health and Human Serv-ices, including the National Institutes of Health, the National In-stitute of Mental Health, and the Office of the Assistant Secretaryfor Planning and Evaluation; the Department of Agriculture, in-cluding the Cooperative Service Research Service, the EconomicResearch Service, and the Forest Service; the Department of De-fense; the Department of Education; the Department of Labor; theDepartment of Justice; the Department of Transportation; the De-partment of Housing and Urban Development; the Department ofCommerce; and the Smithsonian Institution. The U.S. intelligenceagencies employ many behavioral and social scientists and supportextramural research in the behavioral and social sciences. Theirwork is not covered in this report.1. THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION(See Tables 12,13, and 14 for data on funding trends.)The fields of social and behavioral research now are allocatedabout five percent of the National Science Foundation (NSF)budget. The Foundation supports extramural basic and applied re-search in most aspects of these sciences, and is the only Federalagency with such a broad research support mission. Fields of sup-port include: psychobiology, memory and cognitive processes, socialand developmental psychology, linguistics, anthropology, econom-ics, geography, sociology, measurement methods and data re-sources, history and philosophy of science, political science, law andsocial processes, regulation and policy analyses, decision and man-agement sciences, and studies relating to information sciences.' 2 \" \"Social sciences nec\" stands for social sciences, no elsewhere classified. In 1969, the category included multidisciplinary social science research project areas. Also, this category represented \"single-discipline projects for which a single field ha[d] not been assigned.\" (National ScienceFoundation. federal Fit.ids for Research, Development, and Other Scientific Activities, FiscalYears 1968, 1969, and 1970.

At that time these areas included research in law and educetion not elsewhere classified, and socioeconomic geography. Currently, these areas include, \"linguistics, research in education, i search in history, socioeconomic geography, and research inlaw, e.g., attempts to assess the inact on society of legal systems and practices.\" (National Science Foundation.

Truman recommended that the socialsciences be included in the Foundation's mission, it was decidedthat support for the social sciences would be \"permissive but notmandatory\" because of the objections of natural and physical scien-tists who questioned whether the social sciences really were scien-tific.\" Quantitatively and methodologically sophisticated studiesbegan to receive, support in an effort to demonstrate that thesefads were part ,cf the \"legitimate\" sciences.\" In 1958 the earlierdecision, which had been reviewed since 1953 by NSF policyinak-ers, was reconsidered and a social science office was created. (Foradditional details, see Chapter II of this report.)Between 1945, when discussions about establishing a NationalResearch Foundation began, and 1958, much of Federal support forbasic research in the social sciences was provided by the defenseagenciesthe Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.\"With the outbreak of the Korean conflict, the main focus of behav-ioral and social science research conducted by these departmentsdealt with assessing the testing and selection of recruits, troop mo-bility and behavior in combat, and racial integration in theArmy.'7At first, the NSF limited support in the behavioral and social sci-ences \"... to dispel apprehensions among natural scientists andmembers of Congress about any reformist spirit among social scien-tists, and to take advantage of a broadening acceptance of thesocial sciences as it developed.\" 18 Gene Lyons explained in hisbook, The Uneasy Partnership ..., that***he first projects of social science support ... were limito areas of so-called 'convergence' between thesocial and natural sciencea. In the Biological and MedicalSciences Division, for example, a program was establishedin anthropolog-lca: and related sciences, such as functionalarchaeclogy, human ecology, demography, psycho-linguis-tics, and experimental and quantitative social psychology.Similarly, in the Mathematical, Physical, and EngineeringSciences Division, there was a program in sociophysicalsciences which included interdisciplinary research in suchareas as mathematical social science, human geography,economic engineering, and statistical design ...18 \"National Science Boara.

According to Gene Lyons in his book, The Uneasy Partnership, the \"hard\" edgeof experimental psychology was represented as a designated program area in the biological sci-ences in NSF, op. cit., p. 271.76 68In 1960, the Office. of Social Sciences was renamed the Division ofSocial SalenCes and assumed the same administrative status in theResearch Directorate as,the,fields of natural and physical sciences.Then. Foundation support for the social-sciemes began to increase,apparently as professional social science associations began to exertpressure.2P%Support for additional social science research programs was added`-`political science, history and philosophy of science,science policy, economics, and other studies at the interface of sci-ence and society. \"21Prior to the creation of the Division of Social Sciences, NSF spon- sored a few grants and fellowships in the behavioral sciences that have been referred to as \"biologically oriented psychology studies\"thiough its Division of Biology.22 Grant and fellowship awardswere made in psychobiology, psychology, and anthropology. Afterthe creation of the Division of Social Sciences, this type of researchContinued to be supported by the Biology Division, while othersocial and psychological research projects were placed under theDivision of Soda' Sciences.\"Two other important developments occurred in the late 1960sand early 2970s. First, in 1968 the Congress amended the NSF ena-bling legislation to, among other things, mandate support for thesociaLsciences and the applied sciences. And in 1970, the NationalScience Foundation created the Research Applied to NationalNeeds Program (RANN) to support research to facilitate the appli-cation of science and technology. to solve social problems. Explicitapplications-oriented social problem research projects were initiat-ed.24In 1975, the Directorate for Biological, Behavioral and Social Sci-ences (BBS) was established. Three research programs, social psy-chology (now called social And developmer.....al psychology), anthro-pology, and linguistics, previously in the Division of Social Sci-ences, were placed in the new Division of Behavioral and NeuralSciences, along with neurobiology and psychobiology programs.New programs were created in this Division: Memory and Cogni-tive Processes and Sensory Physiology and Perception.25 Responsi-bility for the remaining programs, which ir.cluded economics;human geography and regional science; sociology, and social indica-tors; political science; law and social sciences; special projects; his-tory and philosophy of science; and science policy research pro-grams remained in the Division of Social Science in this director-ate.26 25 Ibid., p. 272-273.21 U.S. Congress.

Most of the research program is catego-rized as basic research. See tables 13 and 14. NSF says it is the main supporter of \"fundamental social science research in both thepublic and private sector,\" 27 and also \"plays a speical role in ad-vancing research in neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, lin-guistics, and anthropology.\" 28The National Institutes of Health and the ADAMHA agenciessupport more basic research at universities, but such work is more mission-oriented basic research (more health and disease-oriented)than NSF research which focuses on other aspects of behavioralsciences research.29In 1980, the Division of Social Sciences was renamed the Divisionof Social and Economic Sciences. In 1981 and 1982, two new re- search areas were addedregulation and policy analysis and deci-sion and management sciences.29Over the years, NSF's support objectives for the behavioral andsocial sciences have remained essentially the same: the support of studies that are scientific, objective, and quantitative. Foundationsupport has encouraged the so-called \"behavioral\" revolution in thesocial sciences (oze now being challenged by traditionalists whocall for more emphasis on policy relevanceon the study of institu-tions and of rause and effect), database development, and social sci-ence xlethodology.Ti2.National Science Foundation Funding for Behavioral and Social Sci-ences Research as a Percent of Total Federal Funding for These Disciplines,1970-86Fiscal year percent 1970 8.5 1971 7,7 1972 10.3 1973. 10.6 1974 9.9 1975 11.2 1976 12.0 1977 11.2 1978 9.4 1979 8.8 1980 8.4 1981 7.4 1982 6.6 1983 6.3 1984 6.3 1985 5.6 1986 7.6 \" National Science Foundation.

Forsome disciplines of the social and behavioral sciences, theFoundation is the only source of support for investigator-initiated university-based research. ...In most areas, Foundation funding is important because it supports thelonger-range, fundamental work that is essential in build-ing the scientific base of these fields.31NSF's funding for research in the behavioral and social sciencestotals about 15 percent less in 1986 than in 1977. The bulk of fund-ing cuts have been made since 1980. See Table 13.2.

NSF/Division ofScience Resources Stories. 167 p.Originally created in 1953 as the Department of Health, Educa-tion, and Welfare, the agency was redesignated the DHHS in 1979.In the late 1950s, the National Institute of Health (NIH) and theNational Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), at that time a part ofNIH but now a part of Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental HealthAdministration (ADAMHA), began to emerge as large supporters ofbehavioral and social science research.33 For fiscal year 1985,ADAMHA supported about -63 percent of the behavioral sciencebudget and NIH supported a,3ut 3,7 percent. Of the HHS social re-search budget, ADAMHA supports about 28 percent, and NIHabout 19 percent, For 1985, as in the past, the rest of the social re- Search funds will be obligated by agencies concerned with HHSsocial services missions; the Health Care Financing Administra-tion, 22 percent; the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health,12 percent; the Social Security Admin::tration, 11 percent; and theHuman Development Services Office, 1; percent. The Office of As-sistant Secretary for Planning and. Evaluation (ASPE) is the princi-pal adviser to the Secretary of HHS regarding economic, social,and program analysis concerns. In the past it supported substantialamounts of social research (for instance in fiscal year 1978, about$30 million) but its budget has been cut unz:er the Reagan adminis-tration to about $7.5 million, or 5 percent of the total.34 Several ofthese agencies will be discussed below. 3$ Federal Funds for Research and Development, Fiscal Years 1983, 1984, and 1985. p. 46.34 Federal Funds for Research, Development, and Other Scientific Activities, various volumes.84 76a. National Institutes of HealthThe National. Institutes of Health (NIH) is the major biomedicalresearch agency of the Federal Government and the largest singleFederal agency supporter of basic research and development (at$4.3 billion, est. for fiscal year 1985.) Its objective is to improve thehealth of the American people.P6 The NIH Working Group onHealth and Behavior developed a draft \"working definition\" of thekinds of behavioral research it supports. This draft definition indi-cates that, at least as FY 1986 'is concerned, the major foci of be-havioral related health research are:(1) health-impairing habits and lifestyles, such as smoking,heavy drinking, lacking of exercise, poor diet, and poor hygien-ic practices; (2) reactions to illness, including minimization ofthe significance of symptoms, delay in seeking medical careand failure to comply with treatment and rehabilitation regi-mens; and (3) direct alterations in tissue function through thebrain's influence on hormone production and other physiologi-cal responses to psychosocial stimuli, particularly stress.36NIH consists of 11 Institutes and five research divisions. Eightinstitutes appear to support the most readily indent able behav- ioral and social science research through both intramural and ex-tramural projects.\" NIH's behavioral and social research projectscan be labelled most appropriately mission-oriented basic research.Examples of behavioral and social research projects include exami-nation of behavioral factors in nutritional disorders; the behavioralconsequences of lung disease; studies of behavior and the immunesystem; the cultural and social variability of aging across societies;ways to develop means for identifiying behavioral factors in coro-nary heart disease to see whether families can be used to help pa-tients cope with the stress of recuperative medical regimens; andstudy of the \"sensory, processes, mechanisms, and systems of Sensa-tion and perception,\" to better understand sensorimotor problems;the psychosocial problem of the elderly regarding the effect ofhousing and institutional care upon their health.\"b. Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health AdministrationThe National Institute of Mental Health is a component of theAlcohol, D...ug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration alongwith the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism(NIAAA), and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). ?s Other components of DHHS that support such research are the Office of the Assistant Sec-retary for Health, Centers for Disease Contr.1, Food and Drug Adminstration, Health Re-sources and Services Administration.

Many programs that are sponsored by the NIAAA andNIDA originated through NIMH.42According to a Behavioral Sciences Panel Report that appearedin a 1965 NIH Study Committee report, NIH has supported \"re-search and training in all sociology areas and most areas of anthro- pology.\" Most of this research was conducted by the NIMH.NIMH research work, in the past, encompassed \" ... social work, nursing, certain interdisciplinary fields (mental health, rele-vant biological and biochemical research, experimental social psy- chology) and certain ems, ging fields (linguistics, computer sci-ences).\" 44 NIMH has done work in such areas as \"4-7.e early detec- tion of language and learning disabilities and the Prevention of sec- ondary emotional and interpersonal problems\"; the causes of mental illness with special consideration given to depression andsuicide; and the cause and prevention of rape, among other topics.`o The main goals of these strides were to gain new knowl- edge with respect to causes, diagnoses, treatment, and control.NIMH, along with NIAAA and NIDA, support mission-oriented re- search through basic, clinical, and applied research grants throughextramural and intramural research programs.In 1982, the ADAMHA announced that it would curtail the scope of its sponsorship of social research studies to those that are fo- cused explicitly on mental illness or mental health. (See Chapter2.) NIAAA supports research on such topics as psychological and zocial determinantsand consequences of alcohul abuse prevention,and treatment. NIDA research focuses on similar kinds of studiesrelating to drug abuse.c.

The office has focused on interagencypolicy issues and has played a part in designing new DHHS initia-tives.47As of 1977, ASPE was the lead office concerned with poverty re-search in the Federal Government. In 1973, many of the poverty-related research i.zograms sponsored by the Office of Economic Op-portunity had been transferred to the ASPE. On the average about80 percent of ASPE's research has been classified as applied socialresearch.The ASPE has supported both social research end program eval-uation activities. Such activities have included\"income mainte-nance and employment; health; other human services (social serv-ice, education, etc.); and basic research and statistical data.\" 48 Inaddition, ASPE funded researchers and agencies in States and localgovernments to perform social experiments to determine key be-havioral and societal effects on individuals of impk me,atatien of a\"negative income tax plan.\" During the 1970s, experiments focusedon ways to improve administering income maintenance systems, al-ternatives in the delivery of the health care in order to \"measurethe effect of a wide range of cost-sharing insurance plans on thedemand for health care and the effects of health status c ver time,\"as well as testing State and local government delivery :Jr social andhealth service programs. 49As noted al _ve, ASPE activities were cut back beginning in 1981.3. THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURECreated by the Organic Act of 1862, the Department of Agricul-ture (USDA) is charged with the mission to \"improve and maintainfarm income and to develop and expand markets abroad for agri-cultural products. The Department helps to curb and to cure pover-ty, hunger and malnutrition.

Economic and social re-search has always been important to the agricultural mission. Ac-cording to Lyons:* * * Almost from its establishment in 1862, the Depart-ment created an important place for scientific research . .. and gave high priority to the dissemination of scientificknowledge to farmers. This research came to include animpressive program of statistical inventories of rural popu-lations and agricultural extension services. It was in landgrant schools such as the Uni...rsity of Wisconsin . ..that agricultural economics and rural sociology first becamesubjects of scholarly and scientific interest.Support was then extended to other mission-related subjects,such as the impact of industrialization and mechanization, market-ing practices, the economic dislocations of farmers.5'In the early 1960s the Department of Agriculture supported, onaverage, about 18 percent of Federal funding for behavioral andsocial research annually. The percentage decreased during the1970s, fluctuating between 11 and 12 percent and then increased byone or two percentage points during the 1980s. It is estimated thatin fiscal year 1986, the Department will obligate about $82.6 million for these fields, out of a total research budget of $418.5 million.Almost all of this $82.6 million is for social science, about 80 per-cent is applied.The Cooperative Stag Research Services (CSRS) and the Eco-nomic Research Service (ERS) funded most basic and applied socialscience research from the early 1960s through the es...ly 1980s, fol-lowed by the Forest Service. The USDA began a sm,-,11 amount offunding for behavioral science research in the late 1960s. Sueh re-search has been supported at different th Leseither by the Agricul- tural Research Service, the ERS, or the Forest Service. Discussednext will be the programs of CSRS.a. The Cooperative State Research ServiceThe Cooperative State Research Service (CSRS), created in 1961,\"provides ...financial support to the State Agricultural Experi-ment Stations (SAES), cooperating forestry schools, the land-grant 52 Lyons, op. cit., p. 31-32.69 81colleges of 1890, and the Tuskegee Institute,' 52 In -:contrast to other. USDA agencies, CSRS supportsInostly,exramural research. It has the largest budget for basic and applied social science research in the ,USDA and supports three grant programs.*State Agricultural Experiment Stations receive research grants through the Hatch Act of 1887 in six. areas(1) \"Aatural resources; (2) forest resources; (3) crop resources; (4) animal resources; (5) people, communities, and institutions; and (6) competition, trade adjustments, and income policy.\" 54 A second grant program, gen- erated as a supplement to the Hatch:Act of 1887, includes two com- Ponents wh:chemphasize r-,t!onal problems such as food and agri- culture policies, pest management, transporation, marketing andstorage; and a program especially for land-grant colleges and Tus- kegee institute which explores ways to provide aid to disadvan- taged rival people, and small farmers.A third grant program offers graduate training in forestry in land-grant colleges, and encourages States through SAES to con- duct forest research. Social science research programs include \"management and protection of forest lands for outdoor recreation and development of policies for the management of forest lands forharvesting and marketing of forest products.\" 55 It is estimated drat in 1986, the CSRS funded social sciences research at a total of $27:6 million.b. The Economic Research ServiceThe Economic Research Service, was created in September 1981by separating \"the functions previously performed by the Econom-ics and Statistics Service into two new program agencies, the Eco- nomia Research Service and the Statistical Reporting Service.\" 56The origin of ERS dates back to 1922 with the creation of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics.57 The mission of the ERS is to provide timely and reliable agricultural economic information to local, State, and Federal decisionmakers. Such information in- cludes, \"research, forecasts of major agricultural ecc,nomic indica-tors, policy analysis, and data.\" 58Most of the social science research conducted at ERS is intramu-ral. ERS performs all facets of social and economic research that concern the \"food and fiber sector, use of [thel Nation's resources,economic growth, and quality of life in rural America.\" 59 Theseareas cover \"estimates of current resource use and availability,output and distribution of food and fiber, forecasts and projectionsof resource use and output, adjustments and performance :in the food and fiber sector ...., 60 52 Basic Research in the Mission Agencies, op. cit., p 30.53 Abramson, op. cit., p. 62.54 Ibid., p. 63.55 Abramson, op. cit., p. 64.8.: U.S. Congress House.

The ForestIn TY 1984, the Forest Service was the third largest supporter ofsocial scientresearch in the USDA. Most of the funding gozs forapplied research.63 Both intramural and extramural research aresupported through eight regional forest experiment stations andthe Forest Products Laboratory.64 The Service uses cooperative re-search agreements, grants, and contracts to support the researchmission.\"This is mission-oriented research support, intended to provide afoundation for applying and developing new technology.66 Socialand behavioral research supported by the Forest Recreation andRelated Human Environment program determines \"who uses out-door recreation facilities, why, and what benefit is gained; how todesign facilities and preserve the environment to enhance recre-ational opportunities; and how to increase safety and discouragevandalism, theft, and littering \" 674. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSEThe Department of Defense (DOD) became an Executive depart-ment of the Federal Government with passage of the National Se-curity Act Amendments of 1949. Its major function is to deter warand protect the security of the Nation.\"hi the fiscal year 1986, the DOD will obligate an estimated $7million for support of social science research and $117 million forthe support of behavioral science research. Most of this funding isused for applied psychology research.\" See Tables 19 and 20.immediately following World War II the defense agencies, theDerartments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, had conducted thebulk of social science research in the Federal Government. In fact,by the early 1950s, about 40 percent of Federal support for socialscience research was supported by the military, basically throughthe Department of the Navy's Office of Naval Research.

After the criticism sur-rounding the project, the passage of the Mansf el(' amendmentwhich limited DOD's support of basic research to explicit missionobjectives, and shifting of attention to winning the war in Vietnam,suppert for social sciences research began to de.rease, as a propor-tion of total research funding.

It supported the development of a \"cost-effective, equitable, and real- istic performance based test in lieu of written tests for measuringlevels of skill in army jobs.\" A key training program developed by the Army was called the Training Extension Course (TEC), whichprovided a variety of personalized training courses ranging from di- verse military skills to basic leadership. In addition, various hand-books have been prepared including \"ways to improve race -ela- tions in the Army, ... alcohol and drug abuse problems . .., and environmental impact analysis [for the Army Cops of Engineers].\"The Navy, as the Air Force and Army, has developed computer-assisted training metinds as well as using mini-computers for the purpose of perfecting training efficiency and management.

Divi-sion, was enlarged with the addition. of cooperative research pro-grams that were conducted through grants awarded to universitiesand non-profit research organizations to perform both research anddemonstration projects.8\u00b0 Through the Elementary and SecondaryEducation Act of 1965, the education program was expanded tocreate research and development centers in specialized disciplinesof education, in educational laboratories, and in clearinghouses forinformation.81 In addition, Title IV of that Act changed 'the direc-tion of education research. \"Whereas earlier research, had beenlimited to small and unrelated projects for the most part,\" GeneLyons reported, \"the new financing allowed for large and sustainedprojects, particularly in the research and development centers andlaboratories of the universities. In fact,\" he continued, \"researchwas now substantially shifted from schools and State departmentsof education, where it had been almost exclusively concentrated, togroups of social scientists in universities and to non-profit andprofit organizations.\" 82By 1977, education was the largest social research and develop-ment area in HEW.

The mission of NIE is \"to pro-mote educational equity and to imizove the quality of educationalpractice.\" 84 Considerable research is performed at NIE-affiliatednational centers and regional laboratories. Research is mission-ori-ented, and nost is extramurally performed through grant and con-tract awards. NIE research is supported through three major pro-gramsdissemination and improvement of practice, educationalpolicy and organization, and teaching and learning. Research prior-ities are established by \"congressional and executive mandates,problems confronting education, and promising uirections of re-search.\" 85 Some areas of study include' language and literacy;basic cognitive skills; teaching; and educa-tion.\" 86The NIE development program provides curriculum and instruc-tional materials for classroom use and testing materials to Leter-mine how well individuals are learning a skill or subjects?It is estimated that for the fiscal year 1986, the Department ofEducation will support a research agenda totaling about $82.7 m\".-lion, of which 67 percent is social sciences research, mainly appLidresearch. NSF data show that funding for educational research hasdecreased 17 percent, and 26 percent in terms of inflation adjustedreal dollars, from 1980 to 1985.886. THE DEPARTMENT OF LABORThe Department of Labor (DOL) was created in 1913 and has themission to \"foster, promote, and develop The welfare of the wageearners of the United States, to improve their working conditions,and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment.\" 89To carry out this mission, the DOL supports a program of socialresearchapplied, basic, and evaluation researchon mission-re-lated issues. See tables 23 and 24.The Department collects and publishes numerous social statisticsreports which are instrumental in shaping poverty and labor poli-cies at all levels of government. Statistical series include:data on he labor force, employment, and unemploymentlevels;the consumer price index;the wholesale price index; andoccupational wage and salaries data. 23 Abramson, op. cit., p. 195.\" National Science Board.

This act specifically provided for researchthat would \"deal more broadly with the effects of automation, theconditions of mobility, the training and improvement of the laLirforce, and the determinants of future manpower needs.\" 99At first, DOL's manpower research program consisted mostly ofcontract work to examine short-range manpower problems. Subse-quently, two grant programs were added, one to fund graduate stu-dents, and the other to award institutional grants to universities inorder to increase the number of social scientists working in themanpower field, and to awaken more interest in the subject. Addi-tional research responsibilities were added later in the Office ofManpower Policy, Evaluation and Research to promote \"experi-mental projects,...[evaluate] and employmentprograms, of knowledge on manpower problems.\" 91DOL's social science research is mission-oriented, mostly appliedwork, and includes, \"social and economics aspects of manpower,training and employment; wages and standards; industrial rela-tions; effect of policies; productivity and technology; [and] oc-cupational safety and health.\"92 Currently most social science re-search is supported by the Occupational Safety and Health Admin-istration (OSHA), the Employment and Training Administration(ETA), the Office of the Secretary, and the Employment StandardsAdministration (ESA).

The rest, extramural research, is performed by industrialfirms and universities and colleges.66 The DOL obligated an esti-mated $14.6 million for social sciences research in the fiscal year1986. This is not significantly different from the range of fundinglevels of the mid-1970s. It does represent a decrease from thehigher funding levels in the period 1978 to 1981. The average fund-ing level for those years was about $41 million. The funding levelof $14.6 million estimated for 1986 is about 64 percent lower thanthe average for that period. In terms of constant dollars, DOLsocial research funding decreased over 60 percent from 1980 to1986. Decrefes are attributable to shifts made during the ReaganAdministration. Some funding support has gone to support basicsocial science research; in the area of economics.97 No behavioralscience research has been funded in DOL since 1980.7. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICEThe Department of Justice (DOJ), established in 1870, plays akey role in \"... protecting against criminals and subversion, inensuring healthy competition of business in our free enterprisesystem, in safeguarding the consumer, and in enforcing drug, im-migration, and naturalization laws.\" 98 Also, it plays an importantrole \"in protecting [U.S.] citizens through its efforts for effectivelaw enforcement, crime prevention, crime detection, and prosecu-tion and rehabilitation of offenders. \"99 See Tables 25 and 26.

The total behavioral and social research budget decreasedto an estimated $1,162,000 in 1986. Most funds will go to theCensus Bureau and the National Bureau of Standards.The EDA traditionally has received the bulk of social researchfunding since its inception, but no funding was requested for EDAsocial research in the fiscal year 1986. This may be due to the factthat efforts are underway to shift support of some Commerce ac-tivities to a self-sustaining basis.Through various DOC departments, the following products, usingsocial information, have been developed and disseminated: 117The Bureau of the Census publishes several guides, referenceworks, and materials that explain the nature and use of itsdata. Also, it issues a number of statistical analyses of whichthe most well known is Statistical Abstracts. Much census datais used in social research studies;The Bureau of Economic Analysis publishes several major doc-uments, which are used by researchers: Survey of Current Busi-ness, Weekly Business Statistics, Business Conditions Digest,Defense Indicators, and Long Term Economic Growth;The EDA provides technical assistance to states and local com-munities through consultants;The National Bureau of Cfandards \"tests hypotheses concern-ing policies that the [F]ederal Government can use to stimulatetechnological innovations in the private sector.\" These experi-ments are conducted \"to find out what results will occur whena policy or practice is changed;\"The National Fire Prevention and Control Administration(NFPCA), which advances professional development of fireservice employees and other individuals involved in fire pre-vention and control, contracts out the development of coursecurricula.

THE ROLE OF PRIVATE FOUNDATIONSThe material in this section on private foundations is based ex- tensively on a historical review prepared by Marshall Robinson, in 1983.1 His study showed that foundations have played an impor- tant role in the development of the behavioral and social sciences.They provided critical support before the beginning of large Gov- ernment programs in the late 1950s and early 1960s; their support provided \"seed capital\" which led to the creation of major behav- ioral and social research institutes; and they have tended to sup- port innovative and often controversial research topics, interdisci-plinary research, and research on social problems topics which Government avoided. Over time the focus of foundation support, according to Robinson, appears to have shifted from funding basic to finding applied research; also about 50 percent of foundation funding for social science research tends to go to support leading research universities and research institutes.I. FUNDINGa. Social Sciences ResearchPrior to 1940, university researchers received the bulk of support from two sources: colleges and universities themselves and founda-tions. Robinson estimated that in the 1920s and 1930s, Laura Spellman Rockefeller Memorial and the Rockefeller Foundation to- gether provided approximately $100 million in support for social science research.2 The Ford Foundation, between the years 1951 and 1956, provided approximately $40 million for the developmentof the basic sciences of individual behavior and human relations, and for evaluation of existing programs.3Since World War II, private foundations appear to have spent more than $1 billion on social science research.4 Overall, founda-tion spending increased following World War H and the social sci- ences shared in the funds available. Generally, increases in founda-tion spending were attributed to the emergence of family-sponsored Robinson. Marshall Research Support and _ntellectual Advances in the Social Sciences.

The rigorous provisions ofthe act adversely affected the grant making programs of privatefoundations.6 The General Accounting Office (GAO) reported a 59percent drop in the establishment of new foundations between 1960and 1970.7 In addition to the restrictions imposed by the 1969 TaxReform Act, the Internal Revenue Service intensified its supervi-sion and scrutiny of foundation performance.According to Robinson, in 1972 private foundations supportedsocial science research totaling $41 million; $160 million wasawarded by colleges and universities, and $307 million by the Fed-eral Government. Thereafter, foundation support for social scienceresearch stabilized at $41 million, and, therefore, decreased 44 per-cent between 1972 and 1980 in terms of constant dollars.

Washington, Jan 1984 p. 19 (Document GGD-84-38.) 103according to data used by Robinson, governmental funding and uni- versity funding, derived in large part from the governmental sector, increased to $300 million from colleges and universities, and to $524 million from the Federal Govrnment.Although foundation support declined relative to other funding sources, the proportion of foundation support allocated to social sci-ence research appears to have increased, when compared to totalfoundation spending. Of the $320 million in grants made by the four largest foundations in 1964 (Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller, and Sloan), 11 percent ($35.2 million) was for the support of the social sciences.8 In 1980, the same four foundations, with a significantly reduced level of support at $160 million, allocated 17 percent of their outlays for social science research ($37.2 million).9Robinson's data on foundation support for the social sciences did not go beyond 1980. The Foundation Center has collected data on all foundation support for social science research (which includes behavioral research) since 1980. This shows that Foundation sup- port for these fields increased from $56.2 million (or 28 percent of total foundation expenditures for social science) in the period 1982 to early 1983, to $59.8 million for the period 1983 to early 1984, or about 25 percent of total foundation awards for social science.19b. Total Social Sciences FundingData in Table 34 show trends in total foundation support for the social sciences (for capital support, continuing support, endow- ments, fellowships and scholarships, general or operating support, matching or challenging grants, program development, research, and not specified) for 1980 to 1983. Foundation support increased for these fields from $68 million in 1980, to $132 million in 1983, an increase of 94 percent. This constitutes an increase from 5.7 per- cent of foundation outlays in 1980, to 7.4 percent in 1983. TABLE 34.-GENERALFOUNDATION FUNDING TRENDS, 1980-83 Facts and figures ca Pnvate Fordaticas.

TYPES OF RESEARCH SUPPORTED BY FOUNDATIONSBetween 1920 and 1950, according to Robinson, foundations em-phasized the support of basic research. By 1964, about equalamounts of support were given to basic and applied research and,by 1980, basic research comprised less than 25 percent of the totalfoundation grant dollars awarded.\"Private foundations have been credited with giving the behavior-al and social sciences identity as legitimate fields of science, withproviding the seed capital to create and sustain core research insti-tutes in these fields,12 and with supporting some research areaswhen Government funding decreased due to fiscal as well as ideo-logical factors.Early foundation activities, according to Robinson, sponsored andsupported:...such critical research organizations as the BrookingsInstitution in Washington, D.C., the Institute for Govern-ment Research (which merged with Brookings in 1928), theNational Bureau of Economic Research in Cambridge, andStanford, the Social Science Research Council in NewYork, and the Food Research Institute at Stanford Univer-sity.13...There were in this prewar era other foundations help-ing the social sciences: the General Education Board, theRosenwald Fund, andmost notablythe Carnegie [which supported not only SSRC, but alsoGunnar Myrdal's landmark study, An American Dilemma,1944].14The Rockefeller Foundation, in 1929, funded the Research Com-mittee on Recent Social Trends. The Russell Sage Foundation, es-tablished in 1907, was considered instrumental in developing socialindicators and interdisciplinary programs involving social scientistsand other professionals. Prior to World War II, demographics re-ceived support from the Scripps Foundation for Research in Popu-lation Problems and the Milbank Memorial Fund for assessmentsof the social and political impact of world population changes. Re-search support in anthropology came from the Wenner-Gren Foun-dation prior to receiving increased funding from the National Insti-tutes of Ment& Health (NIMH) and the National Science Founda-tion (NSF).The Ford Foundation, according to Robinson, should be creditedin the 1950s, with giving the term \"behavioral sciences\" legitimacyas a science and with nurturing key developments in \"theory,methodology, and interdisciplinary work.\" 15 The Ford Foundationalso:created the Center for Advanced Study in the BehavioralSciences and it gave new resources to such young institu-tions as the Institute for Social Research at the University Robinson, The Role of the Private Foundations, op. cit. p. 38.13 For a description of some of these institutes, see appendix A to this chapter13 Robinson, The Role of the Private Foundations, op. cit. p. 35.14 Ibid., p. 36.16 Ibid., Social Relations atHarvard;...[the] Research Center for Group Dynamicsat the University of Michigan (originally at the Massachu-setts Institute of Technology); and the Bureau of AppliedSocial Research at Columbia .. .16Foundations provided initial support for area studies which, ac- cording to Robinson,\" ...help[ed] break down the national isola-tion of the American universities.\" 17 They also played a major role in supporting interdisciplinary research and teaching in suchareas as effects of TV violence, and evaluating the effects of publicpolicy, in an attempt to change the \"monodisciplinary norms of social science research,\" to make it more useful.\"The diverse efforts of private foundations have provided venture capital for enlarging knowledge, by allocating funds between exist- ing institutions and new programs, between grants for established purposes and grants in new areas. Foundations also have collabo-rated with government in needed areas of support. Program areas supported by, foundations have included crime research, energy and environmental issues, drug abuse, arms control and disarmamentand populat'Jn policy, and effects of technological changes.3. AWARDS BY DISCIPLINEAs noted above, data from the Foundation Center, in Table 34, provide an overview of the grants awarded by the 101 largest foun-dations. In 1980, private foundations supported social science pro- grams, including social science research, in the amount of $68.0million; in 1981, $75.4 million; 1982, $102.4 million, and 1983,$132.1 million. The grantmaking patterns noted in the table are not representative of all private foundations. The information ob-tained from the 101 foundations covered in this table accounts for 74 percent of the funding but less than two percent of the numberof private grantmaking foundations, since funding is concentrated among a few large foundations.\" A breakdown 1982 to 1983 may be found in table 35. The discipline of political science received the largest amount and iniznber of awards made to the separate social science disciplines. There was a slight increase between 1982 and 1983 in the percentage of award dollars allocated to economics and \"general\" social science.

ILLUSTRATIONS OF SPECIFIC FOUNDATION AWARDS FOR THE SOCIALSCIENCESIn his short review of foundation social science research supportactivities from World War II to the early 1980s, Robinson observedthat \"social science research has continued to find favor among asmall group of large foundations including the 'big four' in socialscienceCarnegie, Ford, Rockefeller, and Sloan.\" 2\u00b0Current comprehensive data on specific foundations supportingsocial science programs is detailed in a publication of the Founda-tion Center, called Grants for Social Science Programs.21 The publi-cation lists 3,141 grants, each totalling more than $5,000, made by305 foundations \"mostly in 1982 and early 1983.\" The total amountawarded by all of the foundations for social science for this ap-proxim,wly 1.5 year period was $202.3 million.22 About 30 percentof the ...wards were for research. These data cannot ..,e comparedwith oth.Jr data in this chapter since they were collected different-ly. The subject distribution of awards is shown below in Table 36.

LIKELY FUTURE FUNDING TRENDS FOR SOCIAL RESEARCHDuring hearings on behavioral and social sciences held by the Task Force on Science Policy in 1985, testimony dealing with future funding trends for social research was heard from two foun- dation officials, Francis X. Sutton, Ford Foundation and Social Sci- ence Research Council, and Albert Rees, Sloan Foundation. Theytestified, basically, that foundation funding for these research areas will continue to be constrained in the future and that fund-ing will go to a .few priority topics. Diminished resources will con- tribute to funding constraints. But another important factor ac- cording to Sutton ';s the public's and foundation trustees' skepti- cism about \"surrender to the authority of experts ... in matters that touch our intimate lives or seem to lie within the realms of practical judgment and experience.\" Sutton also was reported to have attributed funding restraint to \"a growing general skepticism toward social institutions, the possibility for rational amelioration of societal problems and the automatic usefulness of disciplinary knowledge in practical affairs.\" 27B. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORALSCIENCES R&DIn 1977, the Government Division, Bureau of the Census, Depart- ment of Commerce, under contract to the NSF, surveyed and col- lected R&D data on a limited number of State and local govern- ments,\" The survey was limited to 1,599 State and local govern- ments having a 1970 population of 100,000 or more; and the 300 largest district governments in terms of 1972 employment.\" The survey does not include the activities of State universities, collegesand their affiliated schools. This particular study was a continu- ation of a now discontinued series of NSF-sponsored studies on R&D activities that began in 1966 for local governments and 1964 for State goVernments. Table 39 details the size of State agency ex- penditures for social and behavioral sciences R&D activities for se- lected years.

In 1977 totalR&D expenditures for these disciplines was $88.9 million, an in-crease of 653 percent since 1934. In 1964 support for social and be-havioral sciences R&D constituted 16.4 percent of the total R&Dbudget; this percentage increased to 24.8 percent in 1977. The mostdramatic increase occurred between the years 1968 when supportfor the social and behavioral sciences was 19.7 percent of totalR&D expenditures, to 1972, when support constituted approximate-ly one-third of R&D funds (31.5 percent).

But itmay be that State funding increased to compensate for fluctuationsand some decreases in Federal funding for these fields. There is nodata to describe actual trends. The National Science Foundation nolonger collects or compiles definitive data on the R&D activities ofState and local governments, particularly support given by field ofscience, according to Gerard R. Glasser, Jr., director, GovernmentStudies Group, National Science Foundation.Between the years 1976 and 1983, employment of behavioral andsocial scientists at the State level increased by seven percent, from25,600 in 1976 to 27,400 in 1983.3\u00b0 Whether the increase in employ-ment of social and behavioral scientists at the State governmentlevel corresponds with an increase in support for these sciences isnot known.C. BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH IN INDUSTRYNo statistical information has been compiled to describe theamount of support for behavioral and social science research thatindustry provides.However, as indicated in chapter VIII on manpower trends, in-creasing numbers of behavioral and social scientists ale being em-ployed in industry. Two major types of industrial users may beidentified. One consists of the \"social science /survey research/poll-ing/evaluation industry.\" This is comprised largely of social scien-tists, who do contract work for Federal, State and local govern- 3\u00b0 Science and Engineering Personnel. A National Overview. NSF 85-302. op. cit. p. 95.118 111ments, or who conduct public opinion polls or other kinds of survey research for a variety of clients.According to Otto Larsen, Senior Associate, Social and Behavior- al Sciences, National Science Foundation, the survey research in- dustry spends approximately $4 billion annually.\" The National Science Board of the National Science Foundation \"... estimated that some 2,000 survey research organizations conduct surveys and there are many times that number of businesses that conduct their own studies.\" 32 Larsen described this kind of work as follows:Reliable information and sound basic knowledge does have tangible consequence. Past investment in the social and behavioral sciences have led to and improved technol- ogies of considerable dollar value. Multi-million dollar in- dustries, have emerged in the United States from findings, and discoveries traceable to the social and behavioral sci- ences. Profit-oriented private economy adapts and appliesthese products, just as it purchases electronics or medi- cines which started as physical or biological science discov- eries. Important enterprisesare now built around econom-ic forecasting, demographic projections, political polling and survey research, standardized educational, aptitude, and intelligence testing, personnel selection and manage- ment counseling, language demographic projections, politi- cal polling and survey instruction, psychotherapy, cost benefit analysis, human engineering system design, con- sumer research, marketing analysis, symbols and imagedesign, and information dissemination. Whole industries and professions such as advertising, public relations, and mass media audience measurement services, draw continu-ously on information, techniques and measures developed in social and behavioral research.Technologies are also exported (e.g. Gallup Internation- al). They also attract foreign investments as thousands of students come from abroad for advanced training in econo- metrics, linguistics, demography, survey methodology, psy- chometric testing, management science, etc.\"Abt Associates, Inc. a consulting firm with a revenue level of $20 million in 1995, is an example of a profitmaking social science re- search firm. It is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ini- tially designed to conduct social and economic, public policy, and evaluation research, it has, in the course of 20 years, diversified into banking, transportation, health care, economic development, education, .the environment, legal affairs, labor economics, and na- tional defense. Clark C. Abt, founder of Abt Associates, stated in the Twentieth Annual Report, that diversification was partly due to shrinkage in the Federal research market. Considerable work is now done for domestic and international businesses, industry, and State and local governments. The firm played a role in the found- 31 Otto Larsen, Interview, Dec. 1984.32 Only One Science Twelth Annual Report on the National Science Board. National Science Foundation. Washington, U.S. Govt.

In these areas social scientists are increasingly being em-ployed \"...in industrial management, personnel evaluation, envi-ronmental-impact studies, and consumer surveys.\" 3a Behavioraland social scientists also work for or receive subcontracts from thelarge defense contractors for instance working on remote sensingand defense mapping. An article in U.S. News and World Reportnoted that in the Far West, a utility hired an anthropologist todicker with Indians for placement of power lines across theirlands.\"37A few other examples of how industry uses or supports behavior-al and social scientists are given next. Bell Laboratories is an ex-ample of industry employing social and behavioral scientists,mr ..nly industrial/organizational psychologists, who use behavioraland social science knowledge. Psychologists are diversified withinBell Laboratories and work in such departments as: Human Re-sources Studies; Management Employment; Management Staffing,Development, and Employment Administration. Wayne F. Cascio,Professor in the College of Business Administration at the Univer-sity of Colorado, Denver, described one aspect of the work of indus-trial/organizational psychologists as \"behavior costing.\"...[W]e are placing dollar values on the economic con-sequences of employee behaviors such as absenteeism andturnover. It is these economic consequences that lead tolarge costs (or cost savings) for firms, and this approachdovetails nicely with the kinds of activities that many i/opsychologists are involved in.38Industrial/organizational psychology, according to Georgine Pion,administrative officer for human resources, American Psychologi-cal Association (APA), is one of the three main areas of diverrifica-don for psychologists.39 The other main areas cited by Pion were 34 Twentieth Annual Report, 1965-1985.

Two additional areas, con- sumer psychology and engineering psychology, are also attracting additional psychologists. The division of Industrial and Organiza- tional Psychology (Division 14) of the APA had 2,200 members in 1981, and 2,800 APA, members designated this as their major field of practice.4\u00b0 Pion reported, that membership in this Division in- creased to 2,496 in 1985.During hearings held by the Task Force on Science Policy in Sep- tember 1985, several witnesses discussed the history of develop- ment, in industrial organizat'on psychology and their cost-saving contributions to industrial balance sheets. Douglas W. Bray singled out two developments, the \"assessment center method\" (which uses behavioral simulations on candidates for particular assignments) and \"behavioral modeling training\" (toimprove managerial skills).\" 41Pharmaceutical firms have also the psy- chopharmacologists. Examples include Pfizer,42 G.P. maceuticals, Inc.*\" Thereare also examples of published work on artificial intelligence 14 and in human factors that was sponsored by industry.45The Human Sciences and Environment Department of the Gen- eral Motors Research Laboratories uses social scientists and social science knowledge to anticipate and evaluate technology and to assess the impact of its drocesses and products on the environment. Research activities in this department range from ergonomics (in- creasing the efficiency of the man-machine interface) and possen- ger protection system designs, to risk-taking behaviors and opinion surveys on paint preferences.4\u00b0 Walter Albers of the GM research laboratory testified during the hearings on the behavioral and social research held by the Task Force on Science Policy that the number and subjects for inquiry by behavorial and social scientists increased significantly (his department grew fourfold in twelve years). Topics of study now include social change, community noise, risk assessment, and driver behavior.47General Motors also hasa large economics staff, headed byMarina Whitman, an economist, formerly with the Council of Eco-\"Howard, Ann.

CONCLUDING COMMENTSFoundations, State and local governments, and industry are play-ing important roles in the support of behavioral and social scienceresearch. However, their levels of support and objectives are limit-ed. Foundations have supported crucial research institutes and In-dividual researchers doing social policy-oriented research whichmay be deemed too controversial or innovative for government.However, foundations appear to lack funds and progrr.:ns to fillgaps in funding resulting from Government cutbacks. It appearsthat about 50 percent of foundation support goes to leading re-search universities and institutes as performers. There is little in-formation available on the current support levels for behavorialand social science research in State and local governments and inindustry. However, information presented in this chapter and inChapter VIII, on personnel trends, shows that industry's demandfor skills in these disciplines is increasing The Federal Govern-ment has played a critical role in supporting these disciplinesacross all fields, and to all kinds of performers. its role appears tohave been far more crucial, so far at least since World War II, thanthe role of foundations or industry. Better data regarding State andindustrial support and use of these fields are needed to developfuture policy guidelines regarding the appropriate relative supportroles of these sectors.The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, P.L. 97-34, provided taxcredits to corporations for most kinds of new research. The int,en-tion of the Economic Recovery Tax Act was to increase tech_nolegi-cal innovation and productivity by stimulating private sector re-search and development. However, this act explicitly excludedsocial science research from qualifying for such R&D tax credits.With the exclusion of the social sciences as \"qualified research,\"the tax credit may overlook an area of research that may have thepotential to enhance industrial productivity and to promote techno-logical growth. Some behavioral and social scientists have askedthe Congress to consider the pros and cons of amending the Eco-nomic Recovery Tax Act to include behavioral and social scienceresearch. The R&D provisions of the act expired in December 1985.The full act is up for renewal in 1986. 48 Whiteman, Marina, N. Ewnumlisi Ficrn Three Perspectives. Business Ecimumics, APPENDIX A 1NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND RESEARCH INSTITUTESNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONSThere is no official umbrella organization for the social sciences in the United States, but each discipline has a national profession- al association to which most scholars in the field belong. These as- sociations sponsor annual meetings and the publication of journals, maintain professional and ethical standards, and publicize grant and fellowship opportunities. Only rarely do they become directly involved in research (beyond the publication of results); instead, they focus on the professional lives of their members.In contrast to these professional associations are three national organizations that are directly concerned with the research of social scientists.The Social Science Research Council (SSRC), founded in 1923, was created by representatives of the seven major. social sciencedisciplines for the, explicit purpose of advancing research. Governed by a board that is partly elected by the professional associations, and administered by a president and a staff of social scientists, the Council seeks to advance research in the social sciences in a wide variety of ways: it appOints committees of scholars to set priorities and make plans for critical, generally interdisciplinary areas of social science research; it seeks to improve research capabilities through trailing institutes and fellowship programs; it works to support individual research through the provision of post-doctoral grants; it convenes research conferences that are often interdisci- plinary and international; and it sponsors the preparation of books and other research publications that often result from these activi- ties.The Assembly of Behavioral and Social Sciences (ABASS) is one of eight major program unite of the National Research Council, the principal operating agency of the National Academy of Sciences. The Assembly provides the primary forum for the behavioral and social sciences in all National Research Council endeavors and is actively invclved in sfforts to relate the behavioral and social sci- ences to public policy. Governed by a board of social scientists and administered by an executive director and a professional staff, its work is carried out largely through committees of scholars. Gener- ally, its activities are initiated not by scholars but by officials of the federal government, for it is on the government's behalf that the National Research Council is chartered to conduct and sponsor research. The Five-Year Outlook op. cit.(115) f123 116The Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences,founded in1954with funds from the Ford Foundation, providesabout 50 scholars a year with the quiet, the library resources, andthe freedom from teaching and administrative responsibilities thatare conducive to research and writing. Typically, Fellows at theCenter either plan their next research project or complete a bookabout their latest one. In recent years, however, the Center hastaken a more active role in planning and guiding new areas of re-search, primarily by sponsoring conferences and workshops. It isc -..qidered an honor to be invited to be a Fellow at the Center,which remains both a symbolic focus of high quality research and alocale where this research is often generated.RESEARCH INSTITUTESThere are hundreds of-university -based social research institutesin the United States. Most are small, serving the research interestsof a relatively few faculty members and a larger number of gradu-ate students; a few dozen are more extensive, with specialized pro-grams. Of these, two are outstanding both in size and in the quality of research they produce: the Institute for Social Research at theUniversity of Michigan, and the National Opinion Research Centerat the University of Chicago.The Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University ofMichigan was founded in 1946.It has since become the nation's largest and most diversified social science institution situated on auniversity campus. The Institute consists of a number of subsidiaryorganizations; the largest and best known of which is the SurveyResearch Center. The Center, in turn, is widely known for it panelstudies of voters in national elections, its surveys of consumer ex-pectations, and its research into large-seee organizations.The National Opinion Research Center (NORC) was founded in1941 atthe University of Denver, -there it established a nationwidestaff of trained interviewers. In 1947, NORC moved to the Universi-ty of Chicago, where it has focused on methodological developmentand surveys conducted on behalf of a wide variety of private andpublic sponsors. Among its projects, it currently administers theGeneral Social Survey, which is a periodic attempt to obtain stand-ardized informatidn about the general public.Among the research centers and institutes affiliated with univer-sities, the centers for the study of foreign areas deserve specialnote. Where there are concentrations of faculty with expertise of aparticular geographic region, there is often an administrative unitsuch as an institute or center. More often, than not, the unit is aTitle VI Center, i.e., it receives federal funds authorized underTitle VI of the National Defense Education Act of 1958.The impor-tance of these centers extends beyond the administrative supportthey provide for scholars: they combine the functions of teachingand research- to the improvement of eachand they provide anenvironment for interdisciplinary and collaborative teaching andresearch. VII. STUDIES OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE GOV-ERNMENT AND THE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCESA. INTRODUCTIONThis chapter addresses that part of the Task Force request for \"areview of past studies in this field [of the behavioral and social sci-ences], the recommendations they contain, and their impact.\" Thischapter discusses only major reportsusually those that are multi-disciplinary in nature. An attempt has been made to discuss theimpact of the recommendations in these reports.' However, it isvery difficult to identify whether or not subsequent decisions wereinfluenced by the recommendations made. In some cases the proc-ess itself of convening a commission, studying an issue, and report-ing on it, served the function of generating consensus among par-ticipants. Therefore, the report-writing exercise itself constitutedan integral part of the decisionmaking process, since attitudes anddecisions may have changed.The reports that are surveyed next are discussed chronologicallyand thematically.B. REPORTS DURING THE 1950s AND THE EARLY 1960s: LEGITIMATINGTHE SCrANTIFIC STATUS OF THE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCESThere were several behavioral and social science policy reportsduring the late 1950s and early 1960s, focussing on issues relatingto goverance for, funding- of, and use of the behavioral and socialsciences. These reports reflected optimism regarding the potentialutility of these sciences for policymaking and also an awareness ofthe need for better goverance of these burgeoning fields of Federalsupport.Two basic kinds of advisory reports were prepared on the behav-ioral and social sciences during this period. They focussed on legiti-mizing these disciplines as sciences anti giving them the samestatus as the natural and physical sciencesas far as support andattention by science advisory mechanisms.In 1958, a group of behavioral scientists, under the direction ofJames Crier Miller, University of Michigan, released a report enti- Some of this discussion is based on: Lazangeld, Paul F. and Jeffrey G.

The report recom-mended that behavioral scientists should participate in the work ofthe Office of the Assistant to the President for Science and Tech-nology and also that funding should be increased for behavioral sci-ence in various agencies. One result of the report was a series ofpresentations made by behavioral scientists to the President's Sci-ence Advisory Committee.During the early 196ffs, the President's Science Advisory Com-mittee (PSAC) began to debate the issue of whether the social andbehavioral sciences were sciences in the same sense as the hard sci-ences, and, if so, whether they deserved more attention and sup-port. This debate undoubtedly was motivated by the lingeringdoubts as to the extent to which the National Science Foundation(NSF) should support behavioral and social sciences research,under the permissive, as opposed to explicit, mandate given to NSFin 1950. (For details on this history, see Chapter II in this report.)Jerome Wiesner, the President's science advisor, appointed a sub-panel of the life sciences panel of PSAC to study the issue. Theirreport, Strengthening the Behavioral Sciences was released in1962.3 The Weisner report, as it is commonly known, stressed thesimilarities between the behavioral sciences and social sciences, onthe one hand, and the natural and physical sciences, on the other,concerning methodology of mathematical models, and quantifica-tion in some aspects of sociology and psychology.Several observers of the social science/Federal Government rela-tionship, including Lazarsfeld, Reitz, and Orlans,4 helped make the \"social science respectable,\" andhelped rationalize recommendations made in the report for publicsupport for training, support of basic research, large-scale data col-lection and the \"use of social science by 'agencies with action mis-sions.\" The report is notable also since it included, for the firsttime, the notion that the Federal Government might conduct socialexperiments before enacting social legislation. (It should be pointedout that the circumstances of the time, notably the perceived needfor social policy and evaluation information for the expandingGreat Society programs of the 1960s, probably gave more credibil-ity to these fields of science.)Other discernable impacts, according to Or lans, were: \"the en-larged social science program of the National Science Foundationand a few specific grants subsequently awarded by the Foundationfor the mathematical training of social scientists, and ror certain 2 Miller, James G., ed.

Thisin turn led to the expansion of empirical social research inuniversities and the organization of extramural researchagencies eligible for public funding.5\"...Broadening of the composition of the social science division ofthe National Research Council\" to include representatives of eco-nomics, sociology, and political science (whereas before its only be-havioral and social science members represented anthropology andpsychology) was also an important consequence of the Weisnerreport, according to Orlans.6A second major report of the Executive Office of the Presidentwas the study Privacy and the Behavioral Sciences, issued by theOffice of Science and Technology in 1962.7 It emphasized the needfor voluntary participation and informed consent of subjects in be-havioral science research, recommended that institutions support-ing such research develop their own methods for institutionalreview, and that universities and associations emphasize the ethi-cal aspects of behavioral research.Orlans described several other early government reports assess-ing aspects of the behavioral and social sciences in a study conduct-ed for the Congress.9 These included two reports by the FederalCouncil on Science and Technology in 1960 and 1964 which, accord-ing to Orlans, stressed the importance of supporting social re-search, but also the difficulty of applying it to policy;9 a study bythe House Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Developmentin 1964, consisting of replies of officials from major R&D agenciesto questions about the balance of government support between thenatural and social sciences, which showed considerable skepticismabout supporting social sciences;\" a 1965 report of the House Com-mittee on Government Operations, which concluded, according toOrlans, \"that 'massively increased support for scholarship and forinstruction in the humanities and the social sciences . ..be accept- ed as an important national goal,\" but avoided \". . . any judgmentabout exactly what part the Federal Government should play inachieving this goal . ...;\" 11 and excerpts from a U.S. submission 5 Lazarfeld and Reitz, op. cit., p. 15.6 Government and Science, Distribution of Federal Research Funds, Indirect Costs re FederalGrants, heanngs before the Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development of the HouseCommittee on Science and Astronautics, 88th Cong., 2nd sesa., 1964, no 4, as described in TheUse of Social Research in Federal Domestic Programs, vol. 1, op. cit, p. 108-116.Orlans, Harold.

A CONGRESSIONAL INQUIRYBehavioral and social science policy reports during the secondhalf of the 1960s focussed on issues in the utilization of knowledgein policymaking, ethical problems in the conduct by Americans offoreign area social, economic and political research abroad for de-fense agencies, and levels of support appropriate to sustain the sci-entific potential and policy utility of these disciplines.In 1967, the Research and Technical Programs Subcommittee,the Reuss Subcommittee named after Subcommittee chairmanHenry Reuss, of the House Committee on Government Operations,undertook a series of background investigations on the subject offederally supported extramural social research related to domesticprograms in anticipation of holding hearings on priorities and orga-nization for federally sponsored social research. The resulting four-volume set of publications presented considerable data on the sizeand costs of the enterprise, surveyed social scientists workinginside and outside of government to obtain information on thestatus and priorities of these disciplines, and printed collections ofpreviouslyseparatelypublished andespeciallycommissioned papers. The work was directed by Harold Orlans, a social scientistand public administration scholar.\"Orlans concluded that social scientists were eager recipients ofFederal funding, but were not eager to determine and choose prior-ities, especially priorities for Federal fundingan attitude which,he reported, prevented the Subcommittee from meeting its objec-tives of holding hearings on the subject and developing a policy forfunding priorities. The Subcommittee survey revealed, Orlans re-ported, thatThe policies which academic social scientists have advo-cated can be summed up in one word, more: more moneyfor research and especially for basic research; more moneyfor training; more block grants which members of the aca-demic staff may use for research of their own choice; morefreedom from government application, accounting, andporting requirements; a more attentive and respectful gov- Report by the Committee on Government Operations, 89th Cong., sess., H.

Even scholars most critical of thequality of governmental social programmes drew backfrom that sort of statement. Our resultant inability tomake a cogent case for reordering social science researchprogrammes in any definable and administrable mannerwas the main reason why, in the end, hearings were neverheld.' 6It should be noted that scientists in most all disciplines usuallyhave avoided priority-setting exercises because they do not want toforeclose support for research areas which might prove to be pro-ductive in the future and for other reasons. Currently there is apriority-setting exercise being conducted for the behavioral andsocial sciences. (See chapter VII, section J.)D. UTILIZATION AND SPONSORSHIPDuring the 1960s considerable congressional attention was devot-ed to the issue of Prop sot Camelot, a social science project fundedby the Defense Department, which involved American social scien-tists studying conditions which could be used to deter counterrevo-lutionary movements in Latin America. (For additional details, seechapter II, section G in this study.) The project was halted afterconsiderable outcry, but led to congressional hearings on Camelotand on a proposal to create a National Social Science Founda-tion.\" (See chapter II in this study) and on a policy report, the\"Young\" report, which focused on the boundaries of ethically ac-ceptable behavior for social scientists and the fundamental issues '4 Orlans, Harold.

THE \"YOUNG\" REPORT, THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES AND THE FEDERALGOVERNMENTA series of policy studies appeared in the late 1960s, designed inthe main to assess and recommend Federal responsibilities andpayoffs from funding for behavioral and social research in solvingsocial problems. Many of these were prepared by units of the Na-tional Academy of Sciences.The first of these was The Behavioral Sciences and the FederalGovernment, published in 1969 by the National Academy of Sci-ences.\" It is commonly referred to as the \"Young\" report, forDonald R. Young, chairman of the committee of social and behav-ioral scientists who wrote the report, or the \"Lyons\" report, afterthe executive secretary of the committee, Gene M. Lyons.\" Thework was funded by the Russell Sage Foundation and the Depart-ments of Defense and State, partially because the scope of thestudy included looking at the conduct of foreign area researchsponsored by the Government in other countries in reaction to thecancellation of Army's Project Camelot. The \"Young\" report madethe assumption that Federal agencies can use social and behavioralresearch. It recommended, among other things, that each Govern-ment agency and department initiate major programs to indentifylong-range behaviorial research needs; develop training, and re-search funding programs; strengthen staff competence in theseareas; and hire more trained social scientists. It also recommendedthat more basic behaviorial research on foreign countries be sup-ported by NSF and NIH, and the education agencies to counter-actthe previous domination of this area by defense agencies; that be-havioral scientists be added to PSAC and the Office of Science andTechnology to strengthen science policy generally and to accord be-havioral and social sciences status equal to other sciences in policy;and that NSF make more \"institutional and departmental grantsto support long-range research. The committee also recommendedthat the Government create a \"National Institute for Advanced Re-search and Public Policy,\" somewhat analogous to the NIH insti-tutes to provide \"continuing and long-range analyses of national[social] policies and problems.\"Several actions which occurred after publication of the report co-incided with the some of the report's recommendations, althoughothers did not. For instance, social research funding and utilizationfunctions were increased in many Federal agencies, but never tothe extent recommended in the report; the Department of Defensecut back on funding for foreign area social research (a developmentdue, perhaps more to passage of the Mansfield amendmentpassedin 1969, which limited DOD's support of basic research not directly '9 The Behavioral Sciences end the Federal Government.

There does not seemto be significant evidence that the NSF institutional support pro-grams for the social sciences were increased (quite the contrary, infact, since OMB required the NSF institutional grants program tobe terminated in 1970 to free up money to support the new Re-search Applied to National Needs Program)\" Lazarsfeld and Reitzreported that \"it is quite likely that the creation of a special divi-sion within the National Science Foundation on Research Appliedto National Needs is at least an indirect consequence . ...\" of the recommendation to create r4 National Institute for Advanced Re-search, that appeared in the Young report.222. THE \"BRIM\" REPORT, KNOWLEDGE INTO ACTION: IMPROVING THENATION'S USE OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCESThe report Knowledge Into Action: Improving the Nation's Use ofthe Social Sciences, was prepared in 1969 by the Special Commis-sion on the Social Sciences of the National Science Board, the gov-erning board of the National Science Foundation. It is called the\"Brim\" report, after Dr. Orville G. Brim, Jr., chairman of the com-mission and then President of the Russell Sage Foundation. Thereport made the assumption that the social sciences \"have devel-oped acceptable scientific procedures for collection of valid informa-tion on the problems they confront . ..\" and that they could make significant contributions to the solution of problems if they werebetter utilized. Like the Young report, the Brim report called formore social science participation in PSAC and OST. It also calledfor more effective integation of social science knowledge into theprofessions (such as engineering, journalism, and mental health), inGovernment, business labor, community government, and educa-tion, and the addition of social scientists other than economists tothe staff of the Council of Economic Advisors. Special attentionalso was given to the need to improve the collection of social dataand to increase linkages between bodies of data now being collect-ed. The commission also concluded that there were limitations tothe disciplinary organization of universities with respect to the pro-duction of social knowledge: \"The present organization of social sci-ence research is not well oriented to attacks on national socialissues\" and, therefore, that the National Science Foundationshould be appropriated funding to establish about 20 social problemresearch institutes where social scientists and interdisciplinaryteams of social scientists, engineers, and other professionals wouldwork to provide research for specific mission-oriented clients.The social problem research units recommended in the Brimreport were never created; however, the social problem-oriented as-pects of the RANN program provided funding and a movementtoward an institutional arrangement that coincided with the direc-tion of recommendations taken in the report. NSF also initiated 2 See chapter II in this report.Y1 Knew and Bogen, The National Science Board.

INVENTORIES OF RESEARCH NEEDS IN THE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIALSCIENCESThere also were a series of National Academy of Sciences-Nation-al Research Council studies, beginning in the mid-1960s, which in-volved social scientists in an effort to inventory the state-of-the-artand the research and funding needs of each of the behavioral andsocial sciences.231. REPORTS ON BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCHThe first was the section on \"Behavioral Sciences,\" published in1965 in a collected set of essays regarding directions for basic re- search required to meet national goals. A section on \"Applicationof Behavioral Science,\" was printed in 1967 in the companion bookof essays on Applied Science and Technological Progress. Both were prepared by the members of the Committee on Science and PublicPolicy of the National Academy- of Sciences for the House Commit-tee on Science and Astronautics.242. THE BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES: OUTLOOK AND NEEDSThe next report along these lines is the BASS report, The Behav-ioral and Social Sciences: Outlook and Needs, jointly prepared bythe National Research Council and the Social Science ResearchCouncil. It consists of a main report, published in 1969, and sepa-rate reports on each of the disciplines of the behavioral and socialsciences. The main report addressed ways to improve the linkageamong the various disciplines and between the social science com-munity and the government.\" The individual disciplinary volumesassessed the history, objectives, status of research and trainingneeds, and utilization of particular behavioral and social sciences,including anthropology, economics, geography, history as social sci- ence, linguistics, political science, psychiatry as a behavioral sci-ence, psychology, sociology, and statistics, mathematics, and com-putation in the behavioral and social sciences.\" 23 Some of material in this section is based on Knew, Government Science Policy.

Therefore, the School would beinterdisciplinary:under administrative arrangements that lie outside the es-tablished disciplines. Such training and research should bemultidisciplinary (going beyond the behavioral and socialsciences as necessary), and the school should accept re-sponsibility for contributing through its research both to abasic understanding of human relationships and behaviorand to the solution of persistent social problems.29Neither the funding recommendations nor the recommendationsto create a Graduate School of Applied Behavioral Sciences wereimplemented.The BASS report also made several recommendations to improvethe collection and utilization of social data. It recommended thatCongress enact legislation to develop a system of social indicatorsin order to provide better measures of social change and the effectsof social innovations. It also recommended that an annual socialreport be produced, but stopped short of recommending the estab-lishment of a \"council of social advisers to consider the policy im-plications of the report ... until the annual social report shows that social indicators do indeed signal meaningful changes in thequality of life.\" 3\u00b0As discussed in chapter II in this report, proposals were consid-ered to create a Council of Social Advisors in the Congress, butwere not enacted. The Executive branch did create a system ofsocial indicators reporting, but it was criticized because it did notportray data on issues important to all social groups. The effortwas not continued after 1981. Three social indicator reports were . History Panel. History As Social Science. Edited by David S.

STUDIES OF THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION BEHAVIORAL ANDSOCIAL SCIENCES PROGRAMSAt least two major studies of NSF's programs in behavioral andsocial sciences were undertaken in the mid-1970s. These reports aresingled out because of the critical role that National Science Foun-dation plays in supporting the bulk of some kinds of behavioraland social research at universities. \" Cited in The Federal Investment of Knowledge of Social Problems.

The NSF funded the committee \"to examine the scopeand quality of the F,oundation's programs in the behavioral andsocial sciences with a view to recommending possible improvementsin both the substance of the programs and the procedures for man-aging them.\" This report also appears to have been motivated, inpart, by perceptions of faulty management of the Research Appliedto National Needs (RANN) program and :.)y the fact that fundingfor applied social research in the RANN Program had eclipsedfunding for basic social research by about 25 percent. As a result,there was concern that basic research funding was being jeopard-ized. This report is commonly called the Simon report, after itschairman, Herbert A. Simon.34The report reviewed and made recommendations regarding theorganization, quality, and management of NSF's basic and appliedresearch programs, which at that point in time were clearly differ-entiated into these two categories for administrative purposes. Italso addressed several issues relevant to internal developments inthe disciplines, especially those affected by Federal funding, suchas publication of basic research reports, which had been fundedwith NSF support; support for young researchers in the behavioraland social sciences; and facilities and equipment support needed inthese disciplines. Recommendations were made about how NSFmight better manage its basic and applied support programs andabout the need to involve the research community more in NSF'sdecisionmaking. The report criticized the way social research wassupported in the RANN program. A few years after the publicationof the report, the RANN program was terminated in 1981. Basicand applied research funding programs which had been supportedin different divisions, were combined when the directorate whichfunded applied research was terminated. Thereafter, applied re-search no longer received separate funding and programmatic at-tention although applied research funding is still tracked.\"Around this same time, the House Committee on Science andTechnology sought an independent view of the NSF behavioral andsocial scienzes support programs. A report, prepared by GenevieveKnew, of the Congressional Research Service, Library of Congress,was released in 1977. It gave a detailed historical picture of fund-ing trends for behavioral and social research, identified cliticismsmade of programs, and traced how executive and legislative actionshad influenced the scope, substance, and organization of NSr-swork in these areas. It also addressed the issue of improving NSF'smanagement data systems to improve policies relating to the eval- '4 Social and Behar oral Science Programs in the National Science Foundation.

STUDY OF RESEARCH PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION, THE STUDYPROJECT ON SOCIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTThe next notable study report of the behavioral and social sci-ences consists of a series of five studies under the general title ofthe Study Project on Social Research and Development, which wasprepared by the National Research Council and published by theNational Academy of Sciences. The National Science Foundationhad requested and funded the project with the objective of studyingthe organization, management, and use of social research and de-velopment throughout the Federal Government. The study reportswere released over a three-year period from 1978 to 1981. Theseries is sometimes called the Stokes report, for its chairperson,Donald E. Stokes.Its parts are:Vol. 1.

Analytical essays dealingwith issues in utilization of social research in the policymakingprocess.This report took a broader view than many previous studies, inthat it looked at, in addition to federally funded basic and appliedresearch, federally funded knowledge production and utilization ac-tivities, including development. Thus it concluded that the FederalGovernment funded social and behavioral R&D and related activi-ties totaling about $1.8 billion, about 3 times the amount reportedin 1978 as the total for Federal obligctions for the support of re-search in these disciplines, as reported in the National ScienceFoundation data series, Federal Funds for Research and Develop-ment.

Off., 1977. 168 p. 129surveyed the social knowledge production and utilization activitiesof all agencies and assessed the problems that they shared and themodifications that they could make to enhance utilization. It alsoemphasized that non-Federal users are often larger users of feder-ally funded Facial knowledge and production activities. The studyalso developed the notion that knowledge utilization and applica-tion are difficult, uncertain, and, often, ineffective. (See chapter Xof this report for additional information.)Its recommendations may be summarized as follows:Improving the setting of research agendas.Agencies shouldengage in more planning to produce and use knowledge to solvesocial problems; Federal and non-Federal users, that is programdecisionmakers.and policymakers in Congress, should be more in-volved in the planning of policy-relevant research; \"a number of`problem-centered' research programs should be created to under-take intensive and sustained work on major social problems\"; moreattention should be given to forecasting nroblems and creating re-search agendas to deal with them; and scientific criteria shouldguide research designed to enlarge social knowledge and methodol-ogy.Improving the dissemination and application of knowledge.More attention should be given to disseminating research resultsand to preparing syntheses of the knowledge gained in research;more research should be devote-. to processes of social change andthe adoption of innovations by policymakers.Improving the management of the system.There should be moreoversight of activities to enhance knowledge production and appli-cation; the role of knowledge brokers should be evaluated and in-creased in the areas of policy planning and program development;agencies should review grant and contract policies to use fundinginstruments chosen on the basis of \"a clear view of how responsi-bility for research planning and problem choice should be sharedbetween the agency and the research performer.\"H. OECD STUDIESThe international social science community also looked at issuesof research utilization during this time period. A major work wasundertaken by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and De-velopment, which published, first, a series of review3 of social sci-ence research, teaching, and application in the member countriesand, then, sto,lies assessing how social science information wasused in governmental and industrial decisionmaking.The series on social science in the member countries was spon-sored by the.OECD Directorate for Science, Technology, and Indus-try under authorization from the OECD Meeting of Ministers ofScience. It was, in part, a response to Dr. Harvey Brooks' admoni-tion in an OECD report on Science, .Growth and Society, preparedfor the OECD Secretary-general in 1971 \"that there was a need for`a much closer relationship between policies for science and tech-nology and all socio-economic concerns and governmental responsi- \" The Federal Investment of Knowledge in Social Problems, op. cit., p. 5-6. : *.3..137 130bilities than has existed in the past.' \" 38 So far, three country re-views have been published, for France, in 1975, Japan, in 1977, andfor Finland, in 1981.39The study on use, entitled The Utilisation of the Social Sciencesin Policymaking in the United States, was published in 1980. Thecases dealt with negative income taxation, the concept of the labormarket, the Clean Water Act of 1972, regional planning, the use ofsocial science information at the national level, social research anddevelopment in the Department of Labor, health insurance, andcriminal rehabilitation.40 The study director concluded that socialscience is not always used effectively in decisionmaking. It is mosteffective when social scientists can understand political factorswhich guide decisionmakers and when decisionmakers define prob-lems in ways which do not \"exclude the possibility of a scientificcontribution.\" 41There does not appear to be any published literature evaluatingthe utility of this OECD effort. It is obvious that the research con-ducted, which involved social scientists from different countries,who had to do substantial field research, provided an interestingcross-cultural perspective and afforded scholars an opportunity toobserve the science policy activities of other countries in detail.The OECD series combined also provide a richer information basisto make comparative analyses of social science policies in differentcountries.I. 1980's: NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL REPORTS INTENDED ToCOUNTERACT CRITICISMS AND BUDGET PUTSBy the 1980s, Federal funding for social and some kinds of behav-ioral research had begun to be cut back (see table 2) and the socialsciences were coming under increasing attack for what was per-ceived as their ineffectiveness, inability to contribute to solutions ofpolicy problems, and alleged left-wing ideological stance. Severalpolicy reports were undertaken to document advances in and con-tributions of these fields, in part to counteract some of these criti-cisms.1. BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL RESEARCH: A NATIONAL RESOURCEIn 1980, the National Science Foundation awarded funds to theNational Academy of Sciences to assess the value, significance, andsocial utility of basic research in the behavioral and social sciences.The Academy established a Committee on Basic Research in theBehavioral and Social Sciences to respond to this charge. It waschaired by Robert McC. Adams, later named Secretary of theSmithsonian Institution. The report contains two parts published 28 As cited in. Social Sciences Policy. France.

In it, the Committee empha-sized that \"there are dangers in singling out the behavioral andsocial sciences for measurement against a standard of social utility.Efforts to extend the frontiers of knowledge are fully justifiable ontheir own terms, dependent only on their progress in altering thescientific understandings that were their original points of depar-turd.\" 43 Basically the committee said that basic research in the be-havioral and social sciences should be supported for its knowledge-generating properties, not necessarily because such research hasimmediate or even long-term practical utility. This part of thereport illustrated the evolution of knowledge growth, understand-ing, and use by society of several disciplines. It described how sev-eral lines of research borrowed from research in such other disci-plines as biology and statistics, and how some behavioral and socialresearch provided a foundation for the growth of some professionsand other research disciplines.The major policy recommendation in the report was that:basic research in the behavioral and social scienceslikebasic research in other disciplinesshould be regarded asa long -term investment in social capital. The benefits to so-ciety of such an investment are significant and lasting, al-though often .not immediate or obvious. A steep reductionin the investment may produce short-run savings, but itwould be likely to have damaging long-term consequencesfor the well-being of the nation and its citizens.\" 44Part II contains essays on research findings and use in such spe-cific areas as: demography, voting, behavior and health, income,culture, life-span, methods for surveys and experiments, psychophy-sics, reading, territory, property and tenure, early cognitive devel-opment, and behavior modification.2. RELATED ACTIVITIESThere have been several reports which summarized progress inthe behavioral and social sciences but without necessarily makingrecommendations.Public Law 94-282, the National Science and Technology Policy,Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976, required the preparationof an \"outlook\" report to identify research that may help deal withproblems of national significance and to assess the potential toproduce innovative and potentially beneficial research over thenext five years. In 1981 the Social Science Research Council, wasasked, by the National Science Foundation, to assist in the prepa-ration of this report by preparing a series of review essays on \"re-search that is characterized by scientific merit and momentum\" in 42 Committee on Basic Research in the Behavioral and Social Sciences. Behavioral and SocialScience Research. A National Resource. Edited by Robert McC. Adams, Neil J. Smelser, andDonald J. 'Freiman. Washington, National Academy Press, 1982. Part I. 121 p.

This publication had been com-missioned by President Herbert Hoover in an attempt to identifysocial facts relevant to making public policy. According to the Na-tional Academy of Sciences, it \"marked the beginning of a new erain which social and behavioral sciences began to be applied to thefull range of national concerns, from education and family issues toproblems in public administration, the arts, and criminology. \"46The 1983 symposium acclaimed developments in the use of behav-ioral and social research since 1933, but also recognized the naiveteof some parts of the Ogburn report. The papers presented at thesymposium reviewed the evolution of research on the bases of indi-vidual competence, understanding the rationale for economic deci-sions, how social science contributes to understanding of how gov-ernmental and organizational functions, and the emergence andapplication of social statistics. The work was published as Behav-ioral and Social Science: Fifty Years of Discovery.'\"The exact impact of these reports, if any, is not known. However,it is likely that they together with pressures applied by the univer-sity scientific community, may have influenced the policy choicesmade by the Reagan Administration to restore some funding forthe behavioral and social sciences. (See chart A.) The estimatedfiscal year 1984 budget for the behavioral and social sciences, thefirst budget where funding for the behavioral and social sciencesexceeded that of the fiscal year 1981 level, was 5.5 percent higherthan in 1980 in current dollars, but still 8.8 percent below the fiscalyear 1981 level in terms of constant dollars.J.

This project, called the \"Decade Outlook on Research Oppor-tunities in the Behavioral and Social Sciences,\" is supported princi-pally by the National Science Foundation with the contributionsfrom four other Federal agencies and the Russell Sage Foundationand the Academy. The project report, expected to be released inmid-1986, will identify the kinds of research subjects, resources, fa-cilities, and programs that the Committee believes warrant supportover the period 1986-1995. Priority areas would reflect areas of sig-nificant advance and potential major breakthroughs in fundamen-tal problems. This effort follows in the track of priorities reportsprepared durin,-, the early 1980s by the Academy for other scientif-ic disciplines, especially astronomy and astrophysics (1982), geology(1983), and chemistry (1985). Apparently, an attempt will be madeto identify research directions which will provide a high rate ofreturn on investment.48During the spring of 1985, the Committee announced the initialsubjects on which attention will be concentrated.They include:sensory and perceptual processes; psychobiology cognitive sciences; langune andlanguage processing; development of cognitive and social and behavior; affect and motivation; socialinteraction; gender and jobs and inequality;markets and organizations; collective choice institutions;emergence of social and political institutions, urban transfor-mation and migration; causes and consequences of demograph-ic change; family and domestic relations; formal and legalprocesses; crime and violence; religion and political change;culture and ideology;internationalization of social, economic, aad political life;international crisis management and security studies; macro-economic policy; social studies of modern science and technolo-gy;social knowledge producing institutions; large-scale databases; statistical analysis, and measurement and scaling.\"As noted above in regard to the Reuss Committee inquiry, behav-ioral and social scientists historically do not appear eager toengage in priority-setting exercises.\" Some social scientists havecontinued to raise critical questions about current activities of thisnature. As essay by McCartney summarized major points of opposi-tion:basic research priorities should ix be evaluated on the basisof their practical returns to society;science is unpredictable, and social scientists have no consen-sual criteria for deciding when a field is ripe for discovery;setting priorities will benefit big social science research asopposed to little social science research; \" Holden, Constance.

CONCLUSIONSStudies of the behavioral and social sciences by commissions likethose discussed above serve to provide scientists with an opportuni-ty to review the status of their work and to give them access todecisionmakers. It is difficult to pinpoint exactly if and how suchreports influence policymaking. Many of the recommendationsmade for increased funding or new institutional support mecha-nisms were never heeded. However, these reports probably haveprovided decisionmakers with background information that helpsto shape the way they think and act about policies for behavioraland social research. 51 McCartney, James L.

EMPLOYMENT PA TTERNS AND TRENDS IN THEBEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCESA. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVFEWThis chapter focuries on the size of the behavioral and social sci-ence research community and its employment trends. It shows thatthere has been an impressive growth in the number of behavioraland social scientists over the last twenty-five years, with the supplyof trained personnel now exceeding demand. During the last fewyears, the employment rate for behavioral and social scientists inacademia has decreased, but there have been increases in employ-ment rates of such scientists in industry and in consulting/clinicalservices, especially in the case of psychologists. While there ap- pears to be an oversupply of behavioral and social scientists over-all, some positions offered by industry may go unfilled. There are indications that enrollments in some fields of behavioral and socialscience are falling. According to some observers, the decreasingrates of employment of behavioral and social scientists in academiamay mean that the \"critical mass\" needed to do innovative basicresearch is contracting.This chapter summarizes the size of the community overall, andemployment patterns in academia, industry, and the Federal Gov-ernment. Supply and demand considerations are also discussed.B. GENERAL PATTERNSThe National Science Foundation estimates that the number ofemployed behavioral and social scientists in 1982 was 375,600. (Thisis the latest year for which relevant time series data are available.)This consists of 138,400 psychologists and 237,200 social scientists,or 11.5 percent of the total number of employed U.S. scientists andengineers. While '.,ho absolute number of behavioral and social sci-entists has increased, their proportion as a percentage of total em- ployed scientists and engineers has decreased slightly overtimefrom 14.1 percent of total employed scientists and engineers in1976.1There appears to have been a slight change between 1976 and1982 in the percentage of behavioral and social scientists whoreport research and development as their primary work activity. In1976, 12.7 percent of social scientists reported R&D as their pri-mary work activity. That figure increased to 14.3 percent in 1982.The comparable figures for psychologists were 10.04 percent in1976 and 7.8 percent in 1982. The great majority of those reporting I Figured from table B-7, U.S. National Science Foundation. U.S. Scientists and Engineers.1982. Vol. 1, Detailed Statistical Tables, Washington, U.S. Govt.

DetailedStatistical Tables (NSF 82-314.)(135) s143 136R&D, report basic and applied research, as opposed to development,as their primary activity.2The employer category of \"business and industry\" was the singlelargest employer category of all social scientists in 1982, employingsome 43.5 percent. This represents a significant increase since 1976in the proportion of social scientists working in business and indus-try, when 20.3 percent reported this as their primary function. Thesingle largest employer category for psychologists in 1982 was edu-cational institutions, which employed some 38 percent of psycholo-gists .followed by business and industry at 33 percent. In 1976 12.5percent of psychologists reported \"business and industry\" as theirprimary employer.3Other data show that of those scientists and engineers with doc-torates employed in industry in 1983, 11.5 percent were psycholo-gists (up substantially since 1973, when 5.8 were psychologists), and6 percent were social scientists, a doubling of the proportion since1973, when 3.2 percent were social scientists.4Data from table 40 show that about 38 percent of all psycholo-gists and 28 percent of all social scientists were employed in educa-,tional ;restitutions in 1982. This rate represents a 3 percent de-crease m academic employment for psychologists and a 14 percentdecrease in academic employment for social scientists from 1976(when 42 percent were employed in educational institutions).6Data on doctorates show that the proportion of doctoral levelpsychologists employed in educational institutions has remainedabout the same over the period 1973 to 1983 (11.6 percent to 11.3percent). There was a slight, but steady, increase in the rate of em-ployment of doctoral level social scientists in academic institutions(18.6 percent of the total of all fields in 1976, to 21.8 percent in1983).6The next largest employer category for social scientists is theFederal Government, and for psychologists, is nonprofit institu-tions. State and local governments employ more psychologists thandoes the Federal Government.? 2 See table 40.See ';.able 40.Table B-12a, Employed Doctorial Scientists and Engineers by Field and Type of Employer1973, 1981, and 1983 In Science and Engineenng Personnel A National Overview Washington,D.C. 1585.

There has been a marked increase inthe proportion of doctoral level scientists in government that aresocial scientists (from 9.3 percent in 1976 to 16.7 percent in 1983).8The shift in employment away from academia is also reflected inthe employment patterns of all doctoral level scientists. Of all thedoctoral level scientists and engineers employed in 1983 in busi-ness, academia and the Federal Government, some 27 percent werepsychologists and social scientists. About one-third were employedoutside of academia. In 1973, when 23 percent were behavioral andsocial scientists, only about V5 were employed outside of academia.\u00b0Between 1970 and 1980, growth of employment for all scientificand engineering disciplines increased about 30 percent. The growthrate in employment for psychologists increased about 80 percent,but the growth rate for social scientists was less, at about 27 per-cent. (See chart E.) There were also larger employment growthrates for psychologists in industry (231 percent) than for social sci-entists in industry (133 percent) over the peri:A 1976 to 1982.10 Thegrowth of psychologists employed in this category may be due tomc;zea.F..1 independent clinical practice.\" See table 40.\" It should be pointed out that the American Psychological Association considers thatthe data from the NSFemployment burveyare misleading because psychologists whoare seltem ployed were included by NSF in the \"Bus.ness and Industry\" category, but in most cases 121.9percent of the cases according to APA'e 1983 Census of Psychological Personnel) these psycholo-gists are actually clinical psychologists work in independent practice. The fact that a large percentage of psychologists in independent practice is unique to the field of psychology, as compared to other fields of science, and should be pointed out in the report.. The category of \"Bussnese and Industry,\" which would actually include corporat:ons such as Baxter Travenol, IBMand AT&T, accounts for only 2.4 percent of employed doctoral psycholopsta, as reflected inAPA's 1983 census data.

Thecorresponding rate was a 14 percent decrease for social scientists.\"These decreases may be due to enrollment trends for the study ofthese sciences, since academic employment rates for social and be-havioral scientists appear to fluctuate with rates of academic en-rollment. A growing enrollment in the behavioral sciences in col-leges and universities and was witnessed in the 1960s and throughthe 1970s, with a corresponding expansion of employment rate ofbehavioral and social scientists. There is considerable evidence thatthe enrollment growth trends of the past are declining, with a po-tential for declines in academic employment for these scientists.The peak number of undergraduate degrees in the social sciencesand psychology was in 1974, when 145,449 such degrees we^awarded. A steady decline began since then, with the number d\"such degrees awarded in 1982 at 112,775. There are significant vari-ations by disciplinary field. Regarding the award of baccalaureatedegrees, NSF reported:...Between 1974 and 1982; the number of psychologydegrees dropped 21 percent and the number of sociologyand political science degrees declined 55 percent and 16percent, respectively. Conversely, the number of economicsdegrees rose 38 percent over the same period.\"Similarly patterns were seen in the award of masters degrees.The peak year for the award of masters degrees in this field was1977, with the award of 17,294 masters degrees in the social sci-ences. A steady decline ensued, so that in 1982 the number award-ed was 15,415.About one-third of all Ph.Ds. awarded for the sciences and engi-neering, have gone annually to the fields of the psychological andsocial sciences since the mid-1970s.\" The number of Ph.D. degreesawarded for these fields has stayed about the same, fluctuatingaround the 6,000 per year mark since 1974. But this number repre-sents a net change, since decreases j1 doctoral recipients in thesocial sciences have been offset by increases in the number of pys-chology doctoral recipients.\" (See tables 41 and 42.) 12Based on data in table 40 op. cit. Over the 1973 to 1983 decade, according to NSF, there wassubstantial growth of employment for doctoral social scientists in acadm.. '0^,iost 90 percent),and a smauar rate of growth of employment for doctoral level psycholotists (about 50 percent)(NSF 85-302, op. cit. p. 10.)13NSF 85-302, op. cit. p. 156.14Based on data in Table B-31, Doctoral Degrees Awarded by Field, in NSF 85-302, op. cit., p.156.13See table 42 next page.152 145 TABLE 41.-NUMBER OF DOCTORATE RECIPIENTS BY FIELD OF STUDY, 1974-83 Rept 1983.

The number of doctor-ate .recipients in the social sciences declined 17.5 percent from 1976to 1983 and isr roughly at its 1970 level of 2,646.16 In addition, ac-cording to Alan Kraut, Deputy Executive Offick._ for Policy Studies,American Psychological Association, a decline in doctorates award-ed for the research subfields in psychology was noted for the period1976 to 1981.\" First year enrollments in research psychology fieldsdeclined by 25 percent, during the period 1975 to 1980. He estimat-ed that if the trend continued, the number of psychology research-ers receiving doctorates in 1986 would equal the number receivedin 1968. (See chart F.) 18 Kraut attributed the trends to reductionsin Federal support for research training, instability of funding forsome research areas, and a decline in the academic markets forsocial and behavioral scientists.The 1976 Report of the Committee on National Needs for Bio-medical and Behavioral Research Personnel, National Academy ofSciences, assessed the current and projected supply and demand forscientists in these disciplines. The Committee projected that therate of university and college enrollments would slow in the early1980s and actually decline over the next 10 years.19 The impact of '8 U.S. National Science Foundation.

Using NRC figures for 1976 and 1984, thenumi,ers of new PhDs in many of the research fields of psychology have declined drastically.For example, during this eight -year period, the number of new doctorates in comparative psy-chology has dropped from 22 to 13-a 54 percent decrease. Similarly, the number of new PhDsin experimental psychology declined 53 percent from a peak of 357 in 1976 to 207 in 1984, andthe number of new PhDs in physiological psychology has decreased 45 percent from its peak of183 in 1976. New doctorate production in the personality area has declined by 60 percent since1976-from 62 to 25.

Thisincrease is both absolute, and proportional in relation to the totalnumber of behavioral and, social scientists. In 1976, 59 percent ofpsychologists worked outside of academia; in 1982 that increased to62 percent.21 In 1976, 58 percer., of all social scientists worked out-side of academia. That rate increased to 72 percent in 1982.22 (Seealso chart G.) The 1983 report of the,Committee on National Needssaid that from 1973-1981, the nonacademic employment of Ph.D.scientists in the behavioral fields grew at an average rate of ap-proximately 10 percent, while academic employment of the disci-plines increased at the rate of only 4 percent.23 According to areport of the American Psychological Association new doctoratesare most influenced by these shifts in employment patterns.Though the proportion of doctoral psychologists employedin the academic sector has decreased, the actual numbershave increased at an average rate of about 8.4% per year.Only among recipients of new doctorates do we see anyreal decline in the number employed in academic settingsand, even there, the effect was not pronounced until some-time after 1976.24The shift toward nonacademic employment was toward work inbusiness/industry, self employment in consulting and clinical work,and employment in nonprofit institutions. Primary work activitiesfor these scientific personnel has started to shift from teaching andresearch to consulting, the delivery of professional services, and toapplied activities.\" However, research may also be conducted inconnection with these other primary work activities.The 1983 Committee on National Needs for Biomedical and Be-havioral Research Personnel compiled a body of datt, describing thetrends in employment patterns for the behavioral sciences. (TheCommittee defined the behavioral sciences as including anthropolo-gy, sociology, psychology, and speech and hearing sciences.) Data intable 43 refle::ts the steady increase in employment outside of aca-demia for the behavioral sciences as defined by the Committee. Thedata show the following percentages increases in categories of em-ployment for behavioral scientists between 1973 and 1981: totalacademic empioyment, up 43 percent; business employment, up 171percent; employment in non-profit, up 96 percent; and self-employ-ment, up 287 percent.26 21 See table 40.22 !dem.23 1983 Report on Personnel Needs an 'Training cit., p. 110.24 Pion, Georgine M., Lipsey, M_Ac W., Psychology and Society The Challenge of Change.Americsin Psychologist, v. 39, July 1984: 744261')83 Report on Personnel Needs and Training, op. cit., p. 200.

(See Tables 44and 45.) From 1972-1973, 62.8 percent of doctoral training pro-grams had focused on training academic researchers, by 1979-1980the percentage was 44.9 percent. In contrast, training for work innontraditional objectives (that is, to do research in the field and toattack problems) comprised 2.5 percent of the training in 1972-1973, and by 1979-1980, increased to 16.3 percent.\"The decline in academic employment is more salient in the non-clinical areas of the behavioral sciences. Data compiled by theCommittee on National Needs illustrates that the shift has affectedboth employment and training. The nonclinical component of thebehavioral sciences conducts most of the research in these fields.Behavioral scientists who had initially been trained for researchcareers appear to be shifting into clinical work, self-employment,and practice. In 1972 about 36 percent of all behavioral scientists,as defined by the Committee on National Needs, worked in clinicalareas. By 1981, this percentage increased to 44 percent. (See Table46.) It may be that the difficulty in finding employment in researchand academic positions has led many scientists to obtain licensureor certification for clinical practice.E. TRENDS IN THE EMPLOYMENT OF SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORALSCIENTISTS IN BUSINESS/INDUSTRYIn 1976, 18 percent of all psychological and social scientistsworked in,business and industry; by 1982 that increased to 40 per-cent. In 1982, 148,500 behavioral and social scientists worked in in-dustry according to NSF. This is an increase of 156 percent since1976.29Research and development is not a major focus of the work ac-tivities of psychologists or of the social scientists employed in in-dustry. In 1976, 13,700 psychologists w..re employed in business andindustry, with 1,700, or 12.4 percent classified as working in re-search and development.

In 1976, 44,200 social scientists were classified as working in industry, with 1,600 or 3.6 percent in research and development,\" By 1982, there were 103,200 social scientists working in industry, with 7.7 percent,or 8,000 classified as working in research and development.\" Thelargest field of activity for social scientists both years was in man- agement or administration. The focus of the R&D activities for psy- chologists and social scientists for both years was in applied re- search.Although it is unclear, the increasing trend in industry for social scientists to do research, may also reflect the growth of the survey research/opinion industry, and the increasing reliance on using social scientists in human factors engineering and innovation in high technology industry.F. EMPLOYMENT OF SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENTISTS IN THEFEDERAL GOVERNMENTThe data describing employment of behavioral and social scien-tists in the Federal Government indicate that the number of suchscientists is decreasing as a percentage of total employed psycholog-ical and social scientists. About five social scientists are employed for every psychologist in the Federal Government; the largest em- ployer of social scientists has always been the Defense Departmentand related agencies, while the largest employer of psychologists is the Veterans Administration. Management rather than research is the common job activity.Historical data on scientists and engineers collected by the Na-tional Science Foundation, indicate that the employment rate ofsocial and behavioral scientists in the Federal Government was 6.8 percent of the total social and behavioral science population in1970.33 Another NSF publication using a different data base re- vealed that in 1976, the Federal Government employed 8.4 percentof all social and behavioral scientists.34 Data in table 40 show thatin 1976, 8.4 percent of the total number of social and behavioralscience personnel were employed in the Federal Government.

Data collected by the NSF revealed that thenumber of psychologists at the doctorate level employed in the Fed-eral Government remained constant at 1,200 in 1973, 1981, and1983.38 However, for social scientists, there was a dramatic in-crease between the years 1973 and 1981. In 1973, 1,700 doctoralsocial and behavioral scientists were employed in this sector; andby 1981, 4,300, were employed, an increase of 152.9 percent.\" Em-ployment was maintained at the level of 4,300 for 1983.4\u00b0The National Science Foundation also collects data on employ-ment of scientists directly from the Federal agencies. These datadiffer from and are not comparable with the data already reported.They showed similar trends however. See table 47.

GROWTH OF HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDERSA large part of the expansion of the behavioral sciences and itsdiversification into non-academic employment is attributable to the\"See table 90.33 U.S. National Science Foundation.

REPORTS OF THE COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL NEEDS FOR BIOMEDICALAND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH PERSONNELP.L. 93-348, the National Research Service Awards Act of 1974,directed the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct a con- tinuing study of the national needs for research personnel in thebiomedical and behavioral sciences. The study design was to focus on needed personnel in specific subject areas and on the type oftraining that should be provided by the agencies authorized to fundNational Research Service Awards (NRSA)the National Insti-tutes of Health (NIH), the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental HealthAdministration (ADAMHA), and the Division of Nursing, HealthResources and Services (HRSA). Congressionalaction reauthorized the NSRA programs in P.L. 95-623, the HealthServices Research Act of 1978. The Committee on National Needsfor Biomedical and Behavioral Research Personnel has issuedseven repfirts since 1975.In the 1976 Report on Personnel Needs and Training for Biomedi-cal and Behavioral Research, the Committee on National Needs forBiomedical and Behavioral Research Personnel indicated thatthere would be a potential oversupply for Ph.D. social and behav-ioral scientists by 1985.5\u00b0 Reports released by the Bureau of LaborStatistics and the National Science Foundation (NSF) noted similaremployment trends and labor market conditions.\" 4\u00b0 Health services are defined as assessment and intervention procedures used for understand-ing, predicting, or alleviating emotional psychological and behavioral disability and discomfort(with direct clinical supervision of such services included, but program development, evaluation,and administration excluded).\" Pion, Georgine M.

Off., 1975. 21 and 162 155The Committee on National Needs proposed a restructuring ofthe Federal programs for training grants and fellowships in thefield of biomedical.and behavioral science from predominantly pre-doctoral to postdoctoral. This, it said, would reorient training to re-search where more emphasis was needed. It reported:The Committee recognizes the need for continued federalsupport of training of the behavioral scientists who areconducting research relevant to the health needs of thecountry. Current trends in behavioral science research,however, suggest that a significant reorientation of empha-sis in the federally supported research training effort is de-sirable at this time. Scientific advances in these fieldshave vastly increased the complexity of research methodsand imposed requirements for more intensive training.While the number of Ph.D. level individuals currentlybeing trained in the behavioral sciences appears to meetmarket demands in the conventional disciplines, there is agrowing need for more specialized behavioral science re-search training to deal with these increasingly complex re-search questions in the areas of behavior and health. Thecommittee therefore recommends 8.1 orderly tapering down of predoctoral support with a Icomitant emphasis on providing for research specialiiation through postdoc-toral training, thus assuring the active participation of ad-vanced research training to meet the health needs of thecountry.52The Committee's proposal was to be achieved by shifting fundsamong NSRA programs (NIH, ADAMHA, and HRSA). Some of therecommendations by the Committee were:(1) Reverse the appointment of fellowship awards in thebehavioral sciences from the fiscal year 1975 level of 90percent predoctoral and 10 percent postdoctoral to onethat is 30 percent predoctoral and 70 percent postdoctoral.(2) Increase the number of postdoctoral awards in theclinical sciences approximately 10 percent over the fiscalyear 1975.(3) Enlarge the training program in health services re-search while simultaneously incorporating the training bythe NRSA Act.Many in the social and behavioral science community opposedthe recommendations by the Committee. Specifically, the AmericanPsychological Association disputed the Committee s labor marketanalysis and its recommeded shifts for both programs and person-nel.\" There was added reluctance by directors of NRSA programsto relinquish any support for predoctoral training. The Commit-tee's 1976 recommendations were partly based on constant fiscal U.S. National Science Foundation.

The fiscal year 1975 researchtraining budget of ADAMHA was $19.7 million; in fiscal year 1978,it had beeii.reduced to $16.9 million. By fiscal year 1982, it in-creased to $17.2 million, but was still $2.5 million below the fiscalyear 1975 level.\"After collecting new data on the disciplines and reviewing pastdata, the Committee on National Needs, in its 1983 report, conclud-ed that circumstances had changed since 1975 to justify revision inits recommendations about postdoctoral training. In 1983, the com-mittee decided that the decline in Ph.D. production in the nonclini-cal research fields of behavioral sciences ultimately would limit thesupply of independent investigators needed to conduct basic re-search. The Committee recommended that predoctoral trainingremain at the fiscal year 1981 level (650 awards) during the mid-1980s, while postdoctoral support should increase from the fiscalyear 1981 level of 350 awards to 540 awards by fiscal year 1987.55I. CONCLUDING COMMENTSThe Scientific Manpower Commission, using National ScienceFoundation data, concluded that overall by 1987 there will be asurplus of about 25,300 behavioral and social scientists. Psycholo-gists will be six percent over employment demand levels, but aboutone-third of social scientists will be above demand levels in 1987,according to NSF. These data are based on a supply model whichhas accounted for the \"net outward mobility\" to be expected of be-havioral and social scientists during this perio-1, and, as a result\"substantial surpluses seem apparent,\" according to the ScientificManpower Commission.\" Sse table 48. 64 Ibid., p. 91.66 Ibid.\"Scientific Manpower Commission.

Despite this oversupply, data presented in this chapter haveshown that there is a decreasing number of doctoral level social sci-entists and a decreasing number of doctoral level psychologiststraining to concentrate cn research. There is increasing diversifica-tion in employment of behavioral and social scientists at all levelsfrom academia, the traditional focus of research activity, to indus-try and other sectors, where research is not the principal activityconducted.These trenc 3may have negative implications for both academicresearch and industry. Kenneth Prewitt, former President of theSocial Science Research Council, complained that the social sci-ences are not recruiting \"adequate talent,\" because of limited re-search funds and employment opportunities. This may erode the 165, 158scope of the knowledge base in these areas, because social scienceswill ask less \"consequential and compelvng research questions.\" 58There may also be erosion of the \"critical mess\" necessary to do innovative research, according t another scholar, commenting on sociology:the indexes ofa decline in the critical mass of scholarsinclude many fewer positions in colleges and universities,fewer Ph.D.s being graduated ...,fewer graduate stu- dents being recruited to the discipline, and a decliningnumber of sociologists who retain their membership inprofesiional associations ....The concept of a critical mass of scholars is ,not very precise. But even if relativelyfew persons make a disproportionately large contributionto the innovative ideas of a discipli ,le ..., then a much larger number of scholars still are needed to fill in andelaborate the outlines of big ideas and to serve as audi- ence, critics, and communicants of big ideas. No one knowswhat critical mass of persons is needed to sustain produc-tive scholarship, but gloomy projections about the numberof available positions in academe during the next two dec-ades and decreasing resources may push sociology to itslimits of survival.One index of the decline of creative production in soci-ology is .a substantial decrease in the number of manu-scripts submitted to sociology journals during the past fewyears.59The decrease in the supply of doctoral level sociatscieutists andnew entrants at lower certification levels may portend a gap inmanpower needed to meet projected demand in some areas. TheNational Science Foundation concluded that between 225,000 and235,000 social science jobs will need to be filled during the period1982-1987. One fot.rth of all doctoral scientists employed in indus-try are social and behavioral scientists. The Foundation projectedthat the growth in employment of social scientists (at all levels,B S., M.A., Ph.D.) in industry will range from 2.2 to 3.2. percent foreach year between 1982 and 1987, the highest growth rate of any ofthe scientific fields studied except for computer science. (The otherfields surveyed were mathematical and phyokal sciences, and bio-logical and agricultural sciences.) The projected increase in work-ews in industry, tallied at between 25,000 to 35,000, will result fromindustrial expansion. Two occupational categories seem most indemand: psychologists and economists:PsychologiSts can be expected to benefit from sustainedemphasis of human resources development, health mainte-nance, and program evaluation in such fields as consumerprotection, health, education, etc. They can also expect tobe increasingly called on to analyze the psychological Prewitt, Kenneth.

Economists, on the otherhand, can anticipate an expanding role within industry byapplying their theories and statistical techniques in areasessential to business management decisions; marketing,pricing, international finance, and forecasting.\"The Federal Government has had a major role to play in sup-porting the training of behavioral and social personnel over thelast forty years. Obviously its support patterns are significant. Butas industry's need for research in particular areas increases, indus-try may be asked to assume increasing support functions. In theabsence of targetted industrial programs, market mechanisms ofsupply and demand may provide acceptable personnel levels. How-ever, the effects of laissez-faire policies of manpower production onU.S. research capabilities may be an issue for additional consider-ation by policymakers and scientists. Perhaps the priorities reportbeing prepared now by the National Academy of Sciences will clar-ify some of the issues regarding supply and demand for personnelin these areas and suggest funding priorities for Government andother sectors. \u00b0\u00b0 (NSF 84-304), op. cit., p. 10.167 IX. EXAMPLES OF THE APPLICATION OF BEHAVIORAL ANDSOCIAL RESEARCH IN COMMERCIAL, ADMINISTRATIVE,AND TECHNICAL SETTINGSA. INTRODUCTIONThe Task Force requested that this study include \"an analysisthrough a limited number of case studies of the advantages anddisadvantages of using the research results of social and behavioralsciences in public and private decision-making about policy issues.\"Since this is an extremely complex subject, this report divides theissue into its component parts and discusses them in this chapterand chapters X and XI.Often, studies that assess the use of behavioral and social scienceinformation conclude thz.t it is difficult to demonstrate that suchinformation is used in decisionmaking or has affected policymak-ing. This is due to limitations in the content of information, subtle-ties of the communications process, the complexities of problem-solving and policymaking, and that fact that policymaking hasmultiple decision points. However, these studies also point out thatevaluations of the utility of information in decisionmaking dependon the ways information and decisionmaking are defined Behavor-ial and social scientists may take several different roves wheninteracting with decisionmakers. The effectiveness of their actionsdepends cr.t the role they are playing, what they wish to achieve,the circumstances of the decisionmaking situation, and the kind ofissues at stake.Herbert A. Simon, a Nobel prize winner who is both an econo-mist and a psychologist, discussed these facets of the use andimpact of behavorial and social information on decLionmaking. Hedifferentiated professional activities and functions relating to socialproblem solving into three types. Behavioral and social scientistsmay play an \"engineering-medical\" role when they, within the eth-ical norms of their professions, provide answers to specific ques-tions asked by decisionmakers, without regard necessarily to policyoutcomes.' Information and advice may deal with how to improveproductivity, efficiency, education, behavior etc. There are numer-ous examples of the effective application and use of behavioral andsocial research information in technical, cdnical, organizational,and administrative settings postulated by th:s model. Many havealready been discussed, others will be discussed in this chapter.(Simon's second and third models deal with public policy orienteduses) Generally the effective use and applicaticn of behavioral and ' Simon, Herbert A.

These will be examined in chapters X and XI.) 2This chapter gives examples of the application of behavioral andsocial research directly. The examples cited deal with behavior andhealth, survey research, psychophysics, human factors, behaviortherapy, organizational and industrial behavior, modeling, anddata bases. Also described are the everyday use of behavioral andsocial science terminology by the public, and illustrations of thecontributions of behavioral arid social sciences to understanding inthe physical and natural sciences.B. COMPILATIONS OF RESEARCH FINDINGSSocial and behavioral scientists have abundantly documented thetechnical contributions of their work to the understanding ofhuman development and human and social institutions. One majorcompilation is the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sci-ences, consisting of 17 volumes published by Macmillan in 1967. Itcontains essays giving state-of-the-art reviews of major behavioraland social sciences disciplines, prepared by leading scholars. Aninternational perspective on research breakthroughs and contribu-tions appearsina three-volume encyclopedia published byUNESCO on Main, Trends of Research in the Social and HumanSciences, published in the 1970s.3 Other analytical pieces also docu-ment major behavioral and social sciences discoveries or advances.The National Academy of Sciences held a symposium in 1983, com-memorating 50 years of behavioral and social science research :xiAmerica.4 There is the study Major Advances in Social ScienceSince 1.900, which assessed major theoretical and methodologicaladvances and conditions which led to creativity in the areas dis-cussed. (According to the authors, \"practical demands or conflictsstimulated about three-fourths of all contributions between 1900and 1965.\") 5 There also are studies which document the contribu-tions of each discipline and studies which evaluate the direct appli-cation of behavioral and social science findings in the helping pro- 2 Simon's second model describes a process of \"legislative refers \"in which the profession- al person provides advice or expert knowledge to a legislative body or other public agency\" spe-cifically with regard to solving social problems. Here the client might be interested not onlywhether \"Sesame Street\" helps children learn, (the engineering-medical model), but also wheth-er and how it can help disadvantaged children learn as much as advantaged children. His thirdmodel, of \"public diffusion\", is one in which the social scientist \". .. incorporates his knowledge or advice inbook or article ... and diffuses it through Lne various channels of publication (or oammunicatk,n).\" Knowledge disseminated may be. specific or broad, but it is intended to beused by a wide range of \"publics,\" who hold a variety of views about how w solve problems.(Idem.)&Main Trends of Research in the Social and -Eluman Sciences.

BEHAVIOR AND HEALTHThe behavioral and social sciences have contributed to under-standing of the effects of behavior on biological processes and phys-ical illness caused by such habits as smoking, excessive drinking,and poor diet. It has been estimated that \"over half of the casesseen by physicians have psychological, or behavioral, rather thanphysical, orgins.\" 9 The provision of psychological counseling serv-ices and behavior modification geared to .revention have been shown to cut the number of such visits ar lower health care costs.According to Nelson:In a series of studies conducted in a large prepaid healthplan, it was shown that providing psychological servicesreduced the use of medical services to such a degree thatthe cost savirgs from the latter totally offset the cost ofproviding the new service. Other effects shown by the lit-erature include lower hospitalization use, reduction in theuse of pharmaceuticals, reduction in the use of expensiveand often inappropriate diagnostic procedures, as well asfreeing of the medical staff to give greater attention tocases wheretheirparticularexpertiseisgenuinely needed.1\u00b0Several reports have been published by the Institute of Medicineof the National Academy of Sciences on the status and needs of re- \u00b0Social Scien,'xi America.

SURVEY RESEAL:T.1The development of the technology of survey research and its as- sociated statistical methodologies and techniques, initiated over fifty years ago,\" have been supported largely by the Federal Gov-ernment.\" This research has affected not only the kinds of appealsand'presentations candidates make to voters, but also has spawnedMulti-million dollar industries of political and opinion polling,market research, economic forecasting, standardized testing (foreducation, aptitude, intelligence, and personnel selection) informa-tion dissemination, and program evaluation, based wholly on socialscience research.\" The National Science Board reported in 1981that \"it has been estimated that $4 billion are spent each year inthe United States on all kinds of survey research, an industry thatemploys millions of people directly or indirectly and has had animpact on every American. The capal investment for survi:y re-search in staff, training, equipment, supervision, and interviewingis large. An army of trained interviewers is constantly on call toundertake projects.\"' 5The public is most familiar with one aspect of surveys, publicopinion polls, but survey research also serves many other func-tions.

The American Voter and Nie and Verba'sThe Changing American Voter have profoundly changed the meth-ods political candidates use to persuade voters and organize cam- paigns.13E. PSYCHOPHYSICSPsychophysics, which studies the relationships between themental and physical worlds, focuses on how individuals perceivestimuli that cause sensory reations. For instance, Braida, et. al. inthe Academy study, described the status of psychophysical researchon human sight and hearing and some applications in the design ofsystems to reduce nighttime driving accidents and the developmentof reading machines for the blind.19Subliminal communications technology, based on work in psycho-physics and cognitive psychology, is being used to help preventshoplifting and in advertising. It involves projecting information or a message on a TV screen or in music below a conscious thresholdof perception. The message lasts only a fraction of a second, andtheoretically the receiver does not realize she or he has receivedthe information.\" Some psychologists have reported researchwhich refutes claims that such procedures affect behavior.21 Otherapplications of psychophysics research relate to audition (hear-ing) 22 and applications in such areas as machine speech synth3sisand recognition of speech and sensory aids for deaf and blind per-sons.F.

Once thereason was known, the solution was simple: a requirement thatpilots approaching these kinds of airports repeatedly check altime-ter readings rather than rely solely on vision.\" 25This work has also been used to improve the design of assemblylines. For example, Nelson cited how human factors engineeringled to improvements in: (1) the productivity rates of assemblingelectron::: equipment, because it \"resulted in the time required forassembly of a single unit dropping from 76 to 28 minutes\"; 26 (2)the development of readable and safer highway signs; and (3) in thedesign of robots and assessment of organizational changes thatmight result from increased use of robotics in the workplace. Cog-nitive psychologists have worked closely with computer scientiststo help design computerized systems of artificial intelligence.27Psychologists at the Federal Aviation Administration are cred-ited with developing \"behavioral profiles\", in 1968 and 1969, todetect potential airplane hijackers, based on techniques of psycho-metrics that were developed originally in the course of basic labo-ratory research. They have been credited with enabling airplanepersonneltouse\"asimple,easilyappliedobservational scales ... toidentify high practice (and the screening-by-hardware in number of successful skyjackings declined abruptly.\" 28Humaa factors researc.. appears not to have been used widely inthe nuclear power industry. This reportedly, is a significant omis-sion, since, according to the Kemeny Commission that investigatedthe Three-Mile Island power plant accident in Harrisburg Pennsyl-vt.nia, it was \"people-related problems and not equipment prob-lems\" that caused the accident. It has been reported that the Nu-clear Regulatory Commissio:., as a result of the accident, \"hasshown considerably more interest in such approaches, and has en-listed the assistance of the Human Factors Society to aid in the up-grading of [social and behavioral] elements of nuclear plant designand operation.\" 29G. BEHAVIOR THERAPYBehavior therapy, sometimes called behavior modification ther-apy, draws heavily upon basic research in experimental psychology 24 Nelson, op. cit., p. 6.25 NAS media advisory, June 21, 1982.26 Nelson, op. cit., p. 5.

To the layman, work in this area is perhapsthe most visible type of psychological applications. The Nationalkcademy of Sciences summarized some recent advances and appli-cations in treating a range of emotional and behavioral disorders,including fear reduction techniques to treat anxiety disorders, posi-tive reinforcement of preferred behavior in mentally ill patients,and techniques of self-control, or biofeedback, to help people inducedesired behavioral changes.3\u00b0H. ORGANIZATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL BEHAVIORPsychological and sociological studies of authority, participation,and decisionmaking within organizations have been cited as result-ing in marked improvements in productivity and efficiency in someindustries. Some of these are documented in the study The ChangeMasters by Rosabeth Moss Kanter.\" William Foot Thyte's work insuch areas as employee ownership and worker cooperatives areoften cited as having improved productivity i1. the manufactur-ing 32 and agriculture sectors.33Guest's research on ways to alleviate worker alienation and im-proving leadership are examples of studies which are intended tohelp improve industrial innovation and productivity.\" Nelson hasdescribed some of these applications. For example:An... impressive demonstration of the practical benefitsof greater employee participation and decisionmaking oc-curred when one company acquired another of similar size,age, product line, and structure, (the former being essen-tially participative, and the latter being more conventionaland authoritarian). The acquiring company attempted toimplement its structure and managerial practice in the ac- quired firm, and after two years the return on investmentin the latter company had gone from minus 15 percent toplus 17 percent, productivity had increased from minus 11percent 'to plus 14 percent (compared to a standard of ex-pected production), absence and turnover were cat in half,and hourly earnings increased 26 percent. ...A followup study conducted eight years later showed that these favor-able effects had held up over the years.35There is also some evidence of positive results by Americanfirms, which have begun to utilize the effective Japanese experi-ences with quality control circlesa participatory management \"Wilson, G.

Edwards Deming, dealing with statistical methods of qual-ity control and with social science research of the 1940s and 1950son worker participation. Nelson reported some quantitative results:Lockheed Missile and Space Company in 1974 was thefirst U.S. firm to introduce quality control circles. Theresult, according to one researcher, was that defects de-clined by two-thirds, worker morale and job satisfactionimproved and the company estimated the program hadsaved it $3 million by 1977. Many other U.S. firms havetried this concept since then, and although cost-benefitdata on the effects of the programs is proprietary informa-tion and therefore not public, researchers familiar withmost of these experiments reports them to be on the orderof between 5-to-1 and 15-to-1 returns.36Additional work and implications of this a-ea were reviewed inhearings and a report of the \"Human Factor in Innovation andProductivity,\" by the Subcommittee on Science, Research, andTechnology of the Hous Committee on Science and Technology,1982.37There is also some literature which concludes that the failure ofmany programs, including the development of technological inno-vations and the effectiveness of social programs, is attributable tothe fact that the adoption of an innovation often depends on theactivities that \u00b0cur \"after initial adoption or purchase (during im-plementation) [and] have much more to do with whether an inno-vation is successfully used than preadoption activities.\" 39 The im-plication is that managers should not develop a policy without firstensuring adequate follow-through and an environment conducive tothe adoption of the innovation. It is widely acknowledged, for ex-ample, that: \"the superior economic performanrn of Japanese in-dustry is not entirely attributable to superior ,anovation in thetechnological sphere. Much of this success has been attributed tosuperior organizational and management techniques.\" 3\u00b0 It hasbeen suggested that the U.S. lag in adopting R&D information de-veloped in this country cannot be improved unless more attentionis given to \"understanding and manipulating the social factorswhich largely determine the rate and success or failure of innova-tions as well as their ultimate diffusion.\" 4\u00b0 \" Nelson, op. cit., p. 11.

MODELINGSome firms have used linear programming methods to conductinventory controls and econometric analysis in investment deci-aionmaking. \"For example,\" explained Tornatzky and Solomon:when deciding whether to construct a new plant or to pump oil from a spot where operating costs will be moreexpensive than their existing wells, ... firms use econo- metric techniques to estimate the future market pricesand quantities for their product. This kind of econometricanalysis results in profit estimates under various futureconditions, and if the estimates are favorable, the firm in-veste,41There are also studies of how social science has contributed tothe development of American agriculture and marketing,42 and ofhow Federal agencies use demographic information, developed bysociologists and demographers, in micro-models, to simulate prob-lems in program implementation. For instance, according to a 1981 news release by Cornell University:Tho Department of Agriculture tests Food Stamp Pro-gram changes on a micro-model to estimate which groupswill gain, which will lose, and how much the change willcost. The Congressional Budget Office uses a micromodelto project the total costs of transfer payments over thenext 15 years. The Social Security Administration exploresthe implications of revised public and private pension poli-cies on a micro-model. Alternative energy pricing policiesare tested on a micro-model by the Department of Energy.All these tests depend on the behavioral assumptions inthe model.J. DATABASESThe development of socioeconomic databases has been creditedwith advancing commerce as well as science. During testimonybefore the House Task Force on Science Policy, Nobel Prize win-ning scientist Herbert Simon said sccial science information, muchof it in the form of databases, plays an essential role in our every- day lives, one we often take for granted. He concluded:We cannot pick up a newspaper without being confront-ed with facts about the age distribution of our population,trends in disease and mortality, the level and distributionof its income.... These and other social science datainform us about the world in which we live, shape our views and social attributes, alert us to problems, affect theways we raise our children, manage our cities, regulate theeconomy.43 41 Tornatzky and Solomon, op. cit. p. 4.\" Deavers, Kenneth L Social Science Contributions to Rural Development Policy in the1980s.

Before the House Committee on Science and Technology,Sept. 17, 1985, p. 3. 1-7,63. 170The economic and social data developed by economists and othersocial scientists are used routinely by a wide variety of Federalagencies, with applications in administrative rate setting, socialservices delivery, and fiscal and monetary policy. Examples ofagencies which use such databases include: Council on Wage andPrice Stability, Council of Economic Advisors, Federal Reserve,Treasury Department, Office of Management and Budget, andSocial Security Administration. The National Science Foundationhas supported the methodology and conceptualization of some ofthese efforts. According to Reicken NSF-funded work in this area isused to develop and test social and behavioral measure-ments techniques and mid-range theories of societal func-tioning. Data archives like these really serve two mainpurposes; they economically (by sharing access) extend theempirical base available to the individual investigator; andthey provide both analysts and decision-makers with cur-rent information of relevance to public policy.44It was the idea of establishing, fifty years ago, and con-tinuously collecting serial data on economic performance,according to Reicken, that made it possible to have theeconomic indicators on which so many economic policy de-cisions rest today. Economists use these same serial datafor research. ..,45There are underway similar efforts to develop longitudinal ar-chives of social data, to provide social indicators, that is, \"dependa-ble quantitative signals about changes in the way our socie4y isfunctioning.\" The National Science Foundation and the Social Sci-ence Research Council supported work in this direction. The popu-lar press has also become involved in these efforts. It has been re-ported, for instance, that the newspaper USA Today began publish-ing a \"comprehensive quality of life index\" for the United States inits March 11, 1985 issue. It is reported to be a composite of 21 indi-cators developed by Dr. Dennis F. Johnston, a social indicatorsexpert who formerly developed social indicators while employed bythe Federal Government at the Department of Commerce and theOffice of Management and Budget. The composite consists of datarepresenting several critical areas: health, public safety, education,employment, earnings and income, poverty, housing, family stabili-ty and equality.\" (For additional information about attempts to in-stitutionalize the collection of social indicators in Government, seechapter II in this report.) There is some evidence that multination-al firms are employing behavioral and social scientists in increas-ing numbers to do risk analysis. These studies analyze the political,economic, cultural and social events in cuttntries around the worldto provide information used in making corporate investment deci-sions. 44 Reicken.

USE OF BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL RESEARCH TERMINOLOGY BY THEPUBLICThere are also numerous examples of how the public has come touse social and behavioral research terminology in daily speech andactivities. The public commonly uses a number of concepts, whichhave special meaning to social scientists, since they a...) a short-hand way of describing an issue and its features. Many of theseterms, according to the National Academy of Sciences, have \". .. meanings [which] have moved from the common language to socialscience, which then have returned to ordinary use bearing the spe-cial meaning that social sciences has fixed them with,\" through aprocess called \"labelling.\" This is a process whereby social scien-tists \"label human activities, processes, or events so that they canbound and isolate their subject for study.\" This process also hasutility for public policy* king, according to the Academy, since\"by identifying issues anu nighlighting their most generalizable, sa-lient features by giving therh names, social scientists. ...\" can detach a current issue from some of its controversial context andemotionalism and \"assist the public in thinking through its posi-tion on alternative solutions to 'social problems.\" 47One of the the most common terms of this sort is \"self-fulfillingprophecy,\" a concept widely used !n common language, whoseorigin has been attributed to Robert Merton, a sociologist.48 A self-fulfilling prophecy may be defined as a false belief that is sharedwidely, but it tends, over time, to become true as people act as if itwere true. Such Aomplex social problems, as racism, anti-Semitism,and other forms of prejudice, according to Merton, are prolongedbecause of self-fulfilling prophecies.\"Other concepts, originated by social scientists to categorize andstudy particular social phenomena and now in common usage. in-clude minority group, youth culture, ethnocentrism, charisma, so-cialization, and stereotype,\" fiscal policy gross national product(GNP), identity crisis, the unconscious, and externalities.\" Relatedconcepts are: depression, inflation, human capital, the hidden econ-omy, reference group, status, standard of living, quality of life,sample, acculturation, socialization, alienation, unemployment, ju-venile delinquency, stagflation, caste, and \"culture of poverty.\"L.

Psychological research findingshave also been applied to criminal justice related programs for chil-dren,53 and to such other areas as determination of competence tostand trial and t.i.a insanity defense, expert testimony and the use of polygramS, that is, lie detectors.M. CONTRIBUTION OF BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES TOUNDERSTANDING IN THE PHYSICAL AND NATURAL SCIENCESThere also is the contention that the behavioral and social sci-ences liave contributed to understanding in the physical and natu-ral sciences and that they are are part of a continuum, but perhapsat the more complex level, of the same kind of scholarly pursuitthat is represented by the biological and physical sciences. Thispoint was vividly discussed by Philip Morrison, a vhysicist, in a 1982 National Academy of Sciences publication:The very enterprise of a scientific description of the nat-ural World leads directly to the necessity of the social andbehavioral sciences. At the eyepiece of the telescope thereis a human eye; on the layered strata of the riverbankmay be found the flint tools and hearths of prey moriccampsites; the society of bees both forces and gall... . am a reflective look at the very different society of the ento-thologist. It does not seem pogSibie to draw Eziy clear Unebetween the scientist looking out at the physical or biologi-cal world and another kind of scientist concentrating in-stead on his or lier own species.As research proceeds it has become ever clearer that thefunctioningthe eye in terms of its human significancehas onlyfew elementary principles in common with thefurs'tioning of a camera. It is instead a complex inputde flee to a computing system more intimately connectedto its past than anything constructed in a laboratory. Re-gularities are discovered in the distribution and culturalcomposition of ancient campsites, but once again differentfrom those of the coexisting plant and animal communitiesor of the river deposits that in time covered them. Similar-ly, it has become clearer and clearer that rules of behaviorenforced among bees by transfer of phermones are securedamong humans by a much richer flow of meanings andsymbolsgrammar, eye contact, flag. This implies simplythat the natural sciences must be extended in the samespirit, across what a physical scientists would describe as apnase change, to the study of the extraordinary qualitiesof the species Homo sapiens and its richly dB, erse works.54 53 See, for example., Patterson, G.

Washington, National Academy Pres9, 1982, p. The contributions of the behavioral and social sciences to im- provements in the practice of applied professional fieldssuch as medicine, law, and businessand to the progress of other sciences, especially \"hard\" sciences, was noted by the National Academy of Sciences in a 1982 report by its Committee on Basic Research in the Behavioral and Social Sciences:... The social and behavioral sciences provide the re-search underpinning for all or part of several appliedfields. In medicine psychosocial factors are now strongly implicated in the etiology of some disease and disordersand in the efficacy of treatment ... The legal profession has increasingly engaged in and been influenced by social science research on the impact of regulatory laws andagencies, laws against pornography, the interaction be- tween the incidence of crime and patterns of arrest, trial,and punishment, and the behavioral and social sciencesprovides much of the empirical base for the practices andprinciples promulgated in schools of business, education,urban planning, public health, international affairs, publicadministration, and social welfare. And research in these fields often contributes to the stock of basic knowledge. Fi- nally, many fields of studymathematics, statistics, andcomputer science, for examplehave been stimulated byresearch questions in the social and behavioral sciences to develop particularly suitable models, mcthods, and tech- niques.55There are also other illustrations of cross-fertilization between the natural and social sciences. For instance, cognitive science has developed from inquiries about how to invent a \"thinking comput- er.\" The steps the human brain uses to organize information to solve problems had to be identified. This has led not only to devel- opments in information sciences, but also to applications in behav- ior, with ttdevelopment of compensatory learning programs for individuals with brain disorders, such as dyslexia. The recognition of the interface between the behavioral and social sciences, on the one hand, and the physical and natural sci- ences, on the other, is also illustrated, for instance, by the work ofthe Social Science Research Council's Committee on Social Indica- tors' Subcommittee on Science and Technology Indicators.\" There is also a growing inte lisciplinary field of social impact assessment, developed, in part, to generate understanding and data to respond to the need for environmental impact assessments mandated by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. as Ibid., p.

ISSUES IN THE UTILIZATION OF BEHAVIORAL ANDSOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH IN POLICYMAKINGA. INTRODUCTIONIt was pointed out in the previous chapter that the Task Forceasked the Congressional Research Service to evaluate issues relat- ing to the utilization of research results from the behavioral lad social sciences in private and public decisionmaking. The discussin chapter IX indicated that such evaluations must take into ac- count not only the kind of information, but also the intended use. Examples were given of the use of behavioral and social science in-formation in technical, administrative, and clinical settings, wheredecisions do not involve public policy and where scientists are not concerned necessarily about public policy applications of their re- search. Knowledge application of this sort usually is not difficult totrace and generally is ,perceived as effective.Assessment of the utilization of behavioral and social science in-formation, or, indeed, any kind of natural or physical science infor-mation, in public policymaldng is a complex undertaking. An ex- amination of knowledge application and use of behavioral andsocial S4 fence implies understanding of what knowledge is; the in- stitutional changes which demonstrate use; the variety of roles played by experts in decisionmaldng; and the dynamic, multiplekinds of information which influence the many critical points in political decisionmaldng.Science is observational, objective, slow, and iaierential. Scientif-iclacts are validated by testing hypotheses (eliminating alternativeexplanations for the occurence of the phenomena), and by consen- sus generation. This has been characterized ss a \"rational' process.Policy decisionmaking in the United States, on the other hand, is a process that consists of \"incremental\" actions at many differentpoints and by many different \"actors,\" including appointed andelected officials, as well as lobbyists or advocates, whose activities(which may encompass the use of scientific information) may influ- ence what decisionmakers do. Behavioral and social science infor-mationwhether delivered by experts in testimony before decision-making bodies, presented as data from a database, or published ina professional paper, journal or bookmay affect any point in thesequence of events 'eading to a decision. Furthermore, political de-cisionmaking iq \" .rational\"or not based wholly on objective in- formationto the extent -that political choices are based on a com- plex set of factors including facts, value s, distributive effects andpolitical judgments of the public good.\"There is a considerable body of knowledge about research utiliza-tion in the behavioral and social sciences that gives partial expla-nations of how these sciences may or may not be useful in decision-making. This literature illustrates the dilemmas which confront be-(175)181 176havioral and social scientists seeking to maximize the use of re-search findings in public policy. There are a variety of often con-flicting factorsmany of them are not subject to the control of sci-entistswhich affect utilization. Knowledge theorists, for example,have pointed out that sometimes research information is intendedto be used only in additional research, not prematurely in decision-making. Thus to judge the worth of research on the basis of use isto look only at one subset of the full value of these fields. Psycholo-gists have examined the cognitive aspects of knowledge utiliza-tionde:Thing what inform ation is and how to maximize sendingand receiving messages. They have discovered that knowledge isnot used in a linear fashion, because problems have multiplecauses, solutions, and action decisions. Knowledge will not be usedmerely if it is \"good research.\" Knowledge transmission requires asender ^nd a receiver. In policymaking that may mean social andbehavioral scientists need to be olved in some fashion in the pol- icymaking process. But that may be insufficient to guarantee directuse, or even an obstacle to use. Political scientists have looked atdecisionmaking the flows of influence, identification of ix. wer,cen-ters, utilization of knowledge as power, and the irrationality of de-cisionmaking. Sociologists have studied such other aspects ofknowledge use as organizational behavior and how the configura-tion and environment of an organizatior affect its use o' behavioraland social science informationfor instance, that most policymak-ers prefer scientists to be neutral and objective and not to recom-mend policy or to usurp the decisionmaking functions of elected orappointed officials.Generally these studies of knowledge utilizatior show that be-havioral and social science information probably is used most effec-tively in policymaking as part of a cumulative processoften oc-curring over several years of \"enlightening\" an opinion maker,ordinary concerned citizen, or a decisionmaker, but not necessarilyas an identifiable comronent of a specific decisionmaking sequenceleading to programs or policies. Knowledge utilization, according tothis approach, is judged effective if it helps set the frame of refer-ence for discussion, delimits options, anci puts boundaries aroundthe debate. (The \"enlightenment model\" will be discussed in great-er detail in section D of this chapter.) They have also shown thatbehavic ral and social facts are time and value-dependent, thatsocial and political consensus, as well as scientific validity, areneeded to ensure utilization, and that utilization can be both sym-bolic and instrumental. Inconclusive research may be used just asverified research, depending upon the user and his or her needs. (Itcan be hypothesized that these same factors may affect the use ofnatural and physical sciences information, but that they may bemore burdensome to the behavioral and social sciences because thesubject matter of study is humar. beings whose behavior is inher-ently more irregular and difficult to study than art. physical andnatural science phenomena.

EXAMPLES OF UTILIZATION IN POLICYMAKINGThere are many illustrations of the utilizationusually in a cu- mulative fashionof social and behavioral information in policmaking. One can cite for example, the widespread, diiThse, andoften almost subliminal influence on the ways most people in gen-eral and especially decisionmakers think and the options theyevaluate of political philosophers and economic thinkers fromPlato, through Machiavelli, Adam Smith, Marx, and Keynes. Someearly post-World War II illustrations f how the Government delib-erately used the accumulated findings of these disciplines are chronicled in the report Effective Use of Social Science Research inthe Federal Services. by the Russell Sage Foundation in 1950. Otherexamples appear in a National Academy of Sciences report, Behav-ioral Sciences and the Federal Government, published in 1969, andin a series of investigations by the Subcommittee on Research andTechnical Programs of the House Committee on Government Oper-ations. This latter report lists, for instance, psychological and socialsciences work done by Samuel Stouffer, shortly before the begin-ning of World War II, which led to the development of moralebuilding measures and revised personnel selection and training 1 8 3 178policies.1 It also includes information on public. opinion studies,which were used by various Federal agencies, including the ForestService and other parts of the Agriculture Department, since atleast 1940, in connection with land management policy. Othe illus-trations include the considerable historical record of research onrural welfare and migration to urban areas, conducted by sociolo-gists and economists affiliated with agricul+ural experiment sta-tions in the 1930s.2 Often cited as an example of effective utiliza-tion is the study The Chrysanthemum and the Sword: Patterns ofJapanese Culture, by Ruth Benedict,3 which it is claimed, expandedWesterners' understanding of Japanese culture, and which appearsto have had significant impact on the course of post World War IIU.S. policies toward Japan.There are also notable examples of institutionalized patterns ofusing the social and behavioral sciences in Government. These in-clude the creation of _ cio- economic databases, such as those relat-ing to prices, GNP, dt..nographic trends, and unemployment rates,which have enabled decisionmakers to monitor changes in policy-relevant issue areas. Econometric modeling has been widely used tohelp determine government tax and spending policy decisions.Other forms of institutionalization are reflected in the establish-ment of the Council of Economic Advisors in 1946, to advise thePresident on economic conditions and policies, and the creation ofthe Congressional Budget Office and the Institute for ProgramEvaluation, at the General Accounting Office in 1974 to provideCongress with better economic and evaluation information for usein decisionmaking.In their study Why Sociology Does Not Apply, Scott and Shorecited several illustrations of how sociological reseal eh studies haveinfluenced national policymaking. For instance:Mlle involvement of sociologists such as Cloward andOhlin (1960) m social action programs to combat juveniledelinquency, to reduce school drop-out rates and to preventnarcotics addiction ...; studies by demographers of popu-lation growth and the migration of people in the UnitedStatesinformation said to have provided the basis for\"long-range planning by many of the most important sec-tors and institutions in American society\" . ..and socio- logical research on \"talent loss: a3 a result of inadequateeducational opportunities for persons of low socioeconomicstatus, findings that led to the enactment of remedialmeasures such as: the expansion of state unversities, theestablishment of new scholarships and loan resources, thecreation of Federal programs like Upward Bound, TalentSearch and Vista.\" 4 ' I.

Social experiments are used to field test the efficiency and effectiveness of major program designs before wide-spread implementation. For instance, Scott and Shore cited a con- trolled experiment by Zeisel and other sociological researchers thatdemonstrated that many judicial cases could be sett:ed during pre- trial conferences, sa-Jing the costs of going to trial and reducing thecosts of trial loads.6 Another example cited was a study \"of bailbond procedures by the VERA Institute of New York [that] showedthat the number of defendants released without bail could be quad-rupled without reducing their availability at the time of trial.\" 7During hearings held by the Task Force on Science Policy in Sep-tember 1985, several witnesses testified about the cost savings inpublic expenditures afforded by using applied social science. Ac-cording to Clark C. Abt, President of Abt Associates, a consultingfirm:Spending for applied social sciences research during thepast two decades has consumed only 8 cents out of every$100 of the budgets of federal agencies. If this small levelof spending on research improved the effectiveness of theremainder of Federal budgets of only one percent, it pro-duced in excess, of a tenfold return.8He cited as examples of research which saved money the \"Hous-ing Demand Experiment,\" \"The National Day Care Reimbursement Studies.' He alsosaid that he believe' that appropriate social program experimentswere not being conducted in the areas of greatest expenditures ofFederal funding, such as health, education, and environmentalquality.Along the same lines, Joseph P. Newhouse, head of the Econom-ics Department of the Rand Corporation testified about the savingsin health care costs which have resulted from transferring the re- sults of a health insurance social experiment to a wider group. Funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity and the AssistantSecretary for Planning and Evaluation at the Department ofHealth and Human Services at the cost of about $80 million since1981, it showed that families who paid irore for medical services(via lower deductibles on insurance) sought less medical care thanfamilies who paid less, but their quality of health care did notchange. As a result of these findings, several large firms increasedthe amount of cost-sharing required by their employees in compa- Alberts, Walter, Jr. Utilization of the Social and Behavioral Sciences by Industry.

CRITICISMS ABOUT THE UTILIZATION OF BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIALRESEARCH IN POLICYMAKING1. OVERVIEWDespite these illustrations of use, critics, including many behav-ioral and social scientists, have complained about the lack of utilityof behavioral and social research in policymaking. This view wasexpressed, for instance, in a 1978 report of the National AcademySciences:There are indications . .. thatdissatisfaction with the usefulness of social R&D is not abating. For example, theFederal Council for Science and Technology Task Groupon Social R&D noted that there are indications that toolittle social R&D is relevant to policymaking and that toomuch research, even if relevant, is not available to andutilized by the appropriate decisioninakers. A 1976 Nation-al Research Council review of the National Science Foun-dation's applied social science research concluded: \"thequality of the work is highly variable and on average rela-tively undistinguished, with only modest potential foraseful application.\" In general, social R&D continues to becriticized by members of Congress, executive-branch offi-cials, and social scientists because it is neither good norwell-managed research and has little potential for use.\"This view was also expressed in a 1977 General Accounting Officereport entitled: Social Research and Development of Limited Use toNational Policymakers.\"Otto Larsen, a sociologist and senior advisor on social and behav-ioral sciences at the National Science Foundation, in a statementdesigned probably to motivate the research community towardmaking serious priority choices, recently commented pessinis-Lically:Many, I believe, (myself include-1) have been too optimis-tic about the progress of social science. . ..American social science research has a precarious support base, hasmade very little progress in legitimating its scientificstatus, and confronts a serious collective, intellectual .,!hal-lenge bearing on the use and control of knowledge.

Fundamentally, there has beenno change in the way in which social science is understoodby the dominant figures from physics, engineering, chemis-try, and mathematics. ...It is not just that social sci-ences are deeme\"soft\"; rather, it is a genuine skepticismabout whether t: :ey are sciences at all.\"2. QUESTIONS ABOUT EFFECTIVE USE IN PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSIONSPresidentially appointed commissions were created, especiallyduring the 1960s, to find the causes and suggest the cures for majorsocial problems. Social scientists have often been asked to playmajor roles in the commissions, by providing information to com- mission members. Some researchers believe that social science in-formation has been used effectively in commission work and thatthe major obstacleLse comes from rejection of a commission'srecommendations because they are too controversial and lack\"powerful and permanent advocate[s].\" 17 However, other research-ers are less sanguine and believe that such information or methodsmay contribute to the recommendations, but not to the impact c:the commissions or the policies eventually enacted.\" There is alsothe belief that commission-generated sociological information hasbeen used only if participating scientists had the necessary skillsand ability to bargain in the political arena 19 For instance, JamesQ. Wilson, a social scientist with extensive experience working forthe Government. reported to the National Research Council of theNational Academy of Sciences in 1978 that \". ..Public commis- sions, on the record, have either made no use of social sciences (theKerner Commission), made some use but in ways irrelevant to itspolicy conclusions (the violence commission), or made use of rele-vant but unconvincing and inadequate research (the obscenity com-mission.) 20D. A MODEL OF THE WAY BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCEINFORMATION IS USED MOST EFFECTIVELY IN DECISIONMAKING 1. \"SOCIAL ENGINEERING\" OR EWLIGHTENMENT?Some researche)contend that behavioral and social science in-formation can be us .)d effectively in decisionmaking Li a \"social en-gineering\" mode (that is, social information makes a linear, visible,and direct impact on a decisionmaker and on public policy) and 16 Idem.I1 Seashore Louis, Karen and Robert J Perlman.

In National Academyof Sciences. Knowledge and Policy. The Uncertain Connection. Study Project on Social Researchand Development, v. b, op. cit. p. 85.138 183that this model should be used to judge utility.21 The prevailingview, however, seems to be that this model of utilization is inappro-priate or too grandiose. Most observers say it is wrong to expectsocial science information to be used directly and discernablyin asocial engineering =eelin public policy decisionmaking.22Two factors explain why direct utilization of the \"social engineer-ing\" model may be circumscribed. One is the complex, dynamic,and, above all, political nature of policymaking. A leading knowl-edge theorist, Carol H. Weiss, explained this as follows in reportfor the National Academy of Sciences:The policy world is a complicated arena in which previ-ous knowledge and experience abound and each new studyhas to he fitted into existing views of the world. Moreover,a large number of people, all with their individual theoret-ical and informationalperspectives,are involvedin making and implementing any decision, and their differ-ences have to be resolved through the give-and-take of ne-gotiations. There is a plethora of divergent interest groupswith a stake in the policy outcome, groups whose remu-neration, reputation, and advancement hinge on an appro-priate decision.2 3A second factor is the relatively limited knowledge base in thesefields and the inability of these sciences to contribute materially tocritical aspects of policymaking. On these points Weiss wrote:Social scientists often have grandiose expectations, per-haps tainted with self-interest, of the potential effects ofsocial research on policy. While Government officials arefavorably disposed to social sciences, they tend to usesocial science concepts and findings at modest levels. Onereason is that the knowledge base in the social sciences ismodest, and reliance on it has not been demonstrated toimprove the wisdom of public decisions. It may be that theexpectations of social scientists are too high, that immedi-ate and direct use is expected **hen partial and second-order use is reasonable. The passage of social science 21 See for example, Seashore, Louis and Perlman, op. cit. p. 59.23 See, for example, Weiss, Improving the Linkage. op. cit. p. 78. Others have outlined criteriaof utilization of knowledge in policymaking that place these two functions (that is \"social engrneering\" and \"enlightenment\") as almost two end points on a continum of use. For instance, theNational Academy of Sciences in its final report of the Study Project on Social Researe andDevelopment developed the following \"tests.' of policy relevance for behavioral and re- search, based on the variety of uses illustrated by several cases discussed in the report.Have the findings of this research helped to solve the problem to which it is directed?Have the findingthis research been incorporated into social policies or programs intendedto ameliorate the problem?Have the findings of this research been analyzed and discussed by someone influential in thepolicy process?Are the findings of this research potentially relevant to a current policy debate?Are the findings of this research potentially relevant to future policy debates?Has this research shed light on the nature of a social problem or condition or on how societyor its members function?Has this research contributed to the formulation, design, and conduct of other research, thefindings of which will be helpful in the making of current or future policy?Does this research advance an intellectual discipline that may help to ameliorate social prob.lems?Does this research have scientific merit in the opinion of qualified social scientists?23 Weiss, Improving the Linkage. . .., op. cit. p. 35. 11 8 9e 184knowledge through the filter of political judgment mayoften be a preferable route to action.242. THE ENLIGHTENMENT MODELAware of these factors, over the last ten to fifteen years manycommentators and experts on the utilization of behavioral andsocial research have concluded that while behavioral and social re-search findings may accumulate over time and influence what deci-sionmakers think and do, usually one particular study cannot belinked to one specific policymaking decision. Basically, they con-clude that behavioral and social research \"enlarges the `frame ofreference' for decisionmaking,\" 25 sets boundaries for the discus-sion, and provides an institutional/intellectual history of the issue,and helps to warn decisionmakers to avoid policies which \". ..will almost certainly not produce the intended results.\" 26This information was presented in the report to support the con-clusion that Federal policies, especially funding policies for the be-havioral and social sciences, must recognize that in some casesknowledge produced will not be applied immediately, but in futureyears. William Morrill, President of Mathematica Policy Research,who also has an extensive career in the Federal Government, spokeabout this issue at a congressional breakfast sponsored by the Con-sortiumof SocialScienceAssociationsinSeptember1985. \"Mypically,\" he said, \"social science research excercises moresubtle impact on policies as data from many studies accrue overtime into a body of knowledge.\" 27The enlightenment model of use was discussed implicitly and ex-plicitly during hearings on behavioral and social science held bythe Task Force on Science Policy of the House Committee on Sci-ence and Technology in September 1985. For instance, Albert Rees,Sloan Foundation, testified that often overlooked are the long-termimpacts of the behavioral and social sciences, including \"the wayswe think about human development or co:porate cultures andlabor relations, or crime, depend on social science conceptions.\" 28Francis Sutton, Ford Foundation, agreed, citing, \"the crucial con-tributing role social science played in the gradual elimination of famine in India, or in preparing for resumed diplomatic relationswith China.\" Carol Weiss illustrated \"the enlightenment func-tion\" with a few other examples:No one study has much effect, but, over time, conceptsbecome accepted. Peo 'le begin to accept, for example, that 24Weiss, Improving the Linkage. .., op. cit. p. 85. \"See, for example, Weiss, especially Improving the Linkage, op. cit., passim and Comfort,Louise K.

The notioncomes into currency that prisons, however enlightened, arepoor places for rehabilitating criminals. Over a span oftime and much research, ideas like these filtei into theconsciousness of policy-making officials and attentive pub-lics. They come to play a part in how policymakers defineproblems and the options they examine for coping withthem.\"Nathan Caplan and his associates inter.qewed 204 Federal decision-makers in 1973 and 1974 to determine if .and how they used socialscience research in decisionmaking. Their conclusions were simi-lar.3'Research information may be used by both sides to a conflict.But its major virtue, according to Weiss, is that it \"reduces conflictby narrowing the zone of uncertainty.\" Specifically, she continued:It establishes which variables are implicated in out-comes, something about their relative importance, and theinterrelationships among them. It keeps people from argu-ing about what actually is, and saves them time to dealwith the issue of values--with what ought to be. Althoughit does not resolve the policy issue, it focuses debate moresharply on its problematical and value-related facets.\"Weiss and Bucuvalas's study of the use of social scien\"4 informa-tion by decisionmakers in the mental healt'a field at the Federal,State, and local levels brought some empirical verif.cation. to thesenotions.

SYMBOLIC UTILITYA variation of the enlightenment mode of utilization is the sym-bolic model, in which politicians or advocates on any aide of anissue invoke the findings of behavioral and social science to givestatus and legitirr....zy to their viewpoint. In a comparative interna-tional analysis of governmental commissions, Peta E. Sheriff con-cluded that analysis of the utility of social science \"has ignored theextent to which commissions perform a legitimating functionwithin the political system.\" 35 Among the findings in Scott andShore's historical analysis of the use of sociological studies in Gov-ernment, especially in planning, was a similar conclusion. They ob-served that one of the most important functions served by socialsciences in policymaking is the ceremonial, or symbolic, function ofmaking governmental decisions appear rational and legitimate.36F. FACTORS WHICH IMPEDE THE UTILIZATION OF BEHAVIORAL ANDSOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH FINDINGS IN DECISIONMAKINGThe immediate and effective use of behavioral and social sciencein policymaking may be constrained by the many complex facets ofdecisionmaking noted above. Jr_ addition, credible oehavioral andsocial scientists, in a variety of recent studies, have concluded thatthere arc, several other factors related to the cc -iduct and contentof behavioral and social research and its pre&atation which mayfurther impede effective utilization.\" These factors, which will bediscussed next are: counterintuitive findings, irrelevance, politicalnaivete, need to respond to the academic reward system, inad-equate knowledge and inappropriate quantification, and fraud anddeception.1. POLITICAL NAIVETELack of effective use may be attributed to the political naivete ofsome behavioral and social scientists, who, \"failing to compre nd the fiscal and political realities confronting policy-makers .. sometimes produce recommendations that are imp:ausible, impractical and unrealistic\" 38 or which threaten to change the oper-ations or bureaucracy in which the decision-maker functions. \" Blumer, Martin.

But behav-ioral and social scientists may lack adequate knowledge of bureau-cratic functioning to make pertinent recommendations. But per-haps more important, decisionmakers at all levels usually resistchange because it tends to erode their authority. Decisionmakers,according to Weiss, have different reward systems and methods ofoperation than social scientists:They respond to a very different set of institutional ar-rangements and environments from those that affect re-searchers. The rewards, interactions, and career patternsin the bureaucracy foster activity and accomplishment, ac-commodation with other actions, and caution about step-ping too far beyond the departmental line. Policymakershave to satisfy their superiors (in the Office of the Secre-tary, the Office of the Management and Budget, or theWhite House) and consult with a range of interested par-ties in other executive agencies, the legislature, the workis geared to a fiscal year, in which annual budgeting andthe calendar of expiring legislation create pressures to getdecisions made.\" 41Sometimes, policymakers or research funders cannot specify thekinds of information they need to solve problems in terms compati-ble with the research processes of the behavioral and social sci-ences:Not only is it hard for decisionmakers to identify thetopics on which research should be done, but it is evenharder for them to specify the particular kinds of data orstatistical relationships that would clarify an issue. Some-times they overspecify the research question, assumingmore than is known and foreclosing a range of possibili- \" Scott and Shore, op. cit. p. 28.40 Scott and Shore, op. cit. p. 30.41 Weiss, Improving the Linkage . . ., op. cit. p. 37. ,, ..V..:193t they move to the immediate and practical [too soon].On the other hand, they sometimes overgeneralize thequestion, offering vague objectives without direction as tothe limits on acceptable alternatives or available instru-mentalities.4 2There is also the view that behavioral and social information donot always influence national issues because no amount of addi-tional information will help resolve the issue.43 A related factor isthat organizations which asked for information or sponsored re-search are not always organized in a manner to use it. Szantoncame to this conclusion in his study of why social science advicewas of little use to the cities.44There is also the inescapable view that politicians may reject be-havioral and social science information if it recommends policy oradvocates a position, since science is perceived. as being at its bestwhen it is objective and neutral. (As an example of this principle,Congress' major policy analysis support agencies, the CongressionalResearch Service, the Office of Technology Assessment, and theCongressional Budget Office, may not recommend policies to theirclients, but may discuss options and the pros and cons of policy al-ternatives.)2. COUNTERINTUITIVE FINDINGSAnother reason that behavioral and social science findings maynot be applied easily in policymaking is because they are oftencounterintuitive and, therefore, although correct, are rejected asimplausible guides to action. For instance, only about half thehomeowners in Southern California have earthquake insurance,and, as a result, they could suffer millions of dollars of nonreim-bursable damage. Traditional economic theory would expect peopleto protect themselves against \"such a ruinous possibility.\" But arelatively new field of study, called behavioral economics, hasshown that \"people don't act the way economic theory predictsthey will\" because, \"in the case of insurance ...people want to get something for their premium money.\" They insure againstlosses which they believe will occur, but which do not involve biglosses. However, they tend not to protect themselves against lassesthat are less likely to happen but do involve a big loss. Attemptsare now being made to inject these expectations of \"irrational\" and\"illogical\" behavior into economic models.\"3. IRRELEVANCESeveral factors contribute to the issue of -elevance, including overspecialization and time-frame.According to Scott and Shore, some of the sociological work donefor governmental policymakers is irrelevant. They suggested sever- 42 Weiss, Ibid., p. 4243 Szanton, Peter. Not Well Advised. New York, aussell Sage and The Ford Foundation, 1981.173 p.44 Idem.\" Bales, John.

New York,John Wiley and Sons, 1978. 194 189al reasons why. One \"is that it tends to be too piecemeal, special-ized and partial in scope to ever be applicaMe to policy- -naking.\" 46Citing the criticisms Easton,Harold Orlans, Yehezkel Dror and David Truman), they explainedthat such work is often narrow and focused on one fragment of theproblem at hand. \"As a result, sociological research on policy ques-tions has often lacked the type of general holistic, integrated per-spective that is required for developing and implementing socialpolicies and programs.\" 47The utility of social research for policymaking may be furthercircumscribed by the lack of coincidence between the time spanand the content of social research and the uncertainties and pro-spective nature of policy-making. Thus according to Mayer:Policy-making involves decisions governing events whichextend into future time frames. Research, on the otherhand, is based on known events of the past and present.Such research is often 7. poor basis on which to makepolicy decisions because it does not account for new or un-foreseen events, nor does it take into consideration thepurposeful nature of human bahavior which can act onpresent events to create a different -future.\"4. DIFFERENCE IN REWi.RD SYSTEM MAY GENERATE REa.ARCH WHICH ISTOO LATE, OVERLY QUANTIFIED, AND INAPPROPRIATE AS A GUIDE TOPOLICYBehavioral and social scientists' work and performance are meas-ured according to the reward systems of the scientific disciplines,rather than of policy. As a result their products are meant usuallyto serve and be judged by their scientific peers, not by policymak-ers.Researchers in a university setting need to respond to the re-quirements of the academic reward system which is ... based on publishing research results in books and journals and hewing closeto the mainline interests of the discipline rather than getting en-meshed in interdisciplinary research, which is often derogated aswatered down scholarship. ...\" 49 even though the Government often needs interdisciplinary work. Similarly the goal of achievingtenure requires that researchers fulfill such other traditional func-tions as attending meetings and counseling students. Such require-ments often mean that research takes a long time to do and is writ-ten in technical jargon suitable for publication in a refereed scien-tific journal. The nature of social research and the time delayscaused by the experimeLtal or tedious data-gathering processesused to conduct it usually do not coincide with policymakers' needs.For instance:If policymakers wto know the effects of housing al-lowances on the supp_housing in a community, for ex- .\" Scott and Shore, op. cit. p. 29.41 Idem.48 Mayer, Robert R. Social Science and institutiorBooks, 1981. p. 93.49 Weiss, v. 5, p. 37. f.New Brunswick, Transaction195 ample, there is little previous information on tap and noclear way to find out. The recourse is to carry out an ex-periment and watchbut an experiment is no mean feat.Small samples will not do; a community has to be as satu-rated with housing vouchers as it would be in real life. Allthe poor people eligible must be given vouchers, in orderto see whether the cost of renting or buying a house willgo up and whether old buildings are improved and newbuildings are constructed to fill demand. A long time anda good deal of study would elapse before answers are avail-able; even then, the few communities studied would not berepresentative of the universe [the nation] in which theprogram would ultimately be implemented.5\u00b0Another complex set of research-production factors that tends tolimit effective utilization includes: the relative youth of the socialsciences as sciences; the difficulty of obtaining systematic observa-tions, much less doing experiments with control and experimentalgroups; the uncertain quality of theory and knowledge in these sci-ences; the constantly evolving and multiple views about how to askquestions and answer them; the lack of agreement among scien-tists; and the presence of competing \"schools\" or \"approaches\" toexplaining human behavior. The theory and knowledge base of allsciences is constantly being updated, modified, and improved, butthe fields of the behavioral and social sciences seem more prone tochallenge as their prevailing approaches shift back and forth be-tween structural-functional-in3titutional emphases to quantifiable-behavioral emphases.The Federal Government may be responsible, in part, for some ofthis problem, since it has, over time, tendedin the financing ofbasic researchto support studies which lend themselves to quanti-fication, since these kinds of social research studies are less subjectto attack as being non-scientific. (See chapter II of this study.) How-ever, the dangers of inadequate knowledge, theory, and a misplacedemphasis on quantification may be especially troublesome for thebehavioral and social sciences whose topics of study interface soclosely with public policymaking. Criticims of his nature havebeen directed against all fields of the behavioral and social sci-ences. For instance, Lee J. Cronbach, a Professor at Stanford Uni-versity recently wrote:Recent social science has waffled to false idols. The 1960sand early 1970s placed faith in sheer technique. Psycholo-gistsmany of themcame to think that testing of nullhypotheses is sufficient to make a science and that ran-domized field tests are sufficient to determine a policy. So-ciologists, newly enamored of path analysis, began earnest-ly to give causal meaning to correlations. Economists, de-spite their greater experience, began to see that same kindof analysis as a servomechanism with which to move theworld.51 s\u00b0 Ibid., p. 45-46.51 Cronbach, Lee J. Prudent Aspirations for Social Inquiry. In Kruskal, The Social SciencesTheir Nature and Use, op. cit. p. 62.196 191Several recent essays have addressed these issues in the field ofeconomics. For instance, Theodore W. Schultz criticized university-based economists for too easily accommodating patrons of researchfunds and, as a result for neglecting \"scholarly criticism of econom-ic doctrines and of society s institutions.\"52 Juanita M. Kreps,former Duke University economist, who was Secretary of Com-merce in the Carter Administration, in a farewell interview in1979, stated that social sciences may not be used effectively becausethey do not provide answers to such problems as inflation consid-ered important by Government.\" In her summary of the cases inthe OCED study on the Utilization of Social Science in Policy-Making in the United States, Berger summarized how an attemptto use economics in policymaking was not useful because it ignoredpolicymakers' needs, while, at the time, catered to the formalmathematical models valued in economic science:No case better illustrates the obstacles that the structure of disci-plines can place in the path of cooperation between social scientistsand policy-makers than the Roberts study of the role of economists[in the OECD volume] in the debate over how to treat water pollu-tion. Roberts concludes that the contribution of economists wascompletely irrelevant to the needs of the policy-makers:The academics were answering questions which the realworld was not asking. The Congress wanted a policy whichwould reliably move a lot of recalcitrant towns and indus-tries to clean up their waste discharges. It (or at least itscommittees) were concerned about unforseen risks, provok-ing technical change and avoiding investments that wouldonly look like mistakes in the long run. The economistswere focusing on short-run, inefficient resource allocationin a world of given technology, perfect information, and ra-tional,cost-minimizingwastesources.The Congress wanted to do something about dirty water, the economistswished to correct the failure of a ma7ket to produce resultsconsistent with Pareto Optimality. The pressures of suc-cess and prestige within a university-based guild led manyhighly talented social scientists to see in reality only a re-flection of the conceptual system they brought to the en-counter.To explain this outcome, Roberts points to two factors, the inad-equacy of the theory economists brought to bear on the problem,and the dearth of economists interested in it. Both of these factorsare essentially products of a particular kind of disciplinary develop-ment that assigns high prestige to the elaboration of formal mathe-matical models and to the conceptualization of the economy inhighly abstract, parsimonious terms. This development, cc.nbinedwith the dominance of a particular set of assumptions about howthe economy operatesthe competitive equilibrium modelandabout the goals of the economyPareto Optimalityprovidedeconomists with special lenses through which they viewed pollu-tion. With these lenses, the problem of cleaning up water pollution 62 Schultz, Theodore W. Distortions of Economic Research. In Kruskal, op. cit. p. 132-133.\"Kreps, Juanita M. Introspective Farewell. Washington Post, Nov. 3, 1979: Al, A4. 197 192could only be seen as a problem of \"market failure,\" or finding thecorrect prices for pollution, so that the waste producers, assumed tobe rational, cost-minimizing firms, would readjust their sights. AsRoberts shows in his paper, this view of the world was not only al-together useless to the policy-makers but can hardly be consideredto have come to terms with the problem at all.\"In a study written about five years later, in February 1985,Robert Kuttner surveyed the status of economics and found a \"dis-cipline riven with epistemological doubt on the one hand and rigidformalism on the other.\" He looked at philosophical, traditional,and methodologically sophisticated approaches to economics, andconcluded that much of economics research is not serving publicpolicy (nor generating clearcut answers to scientific questions) be-cause some economists are so attached to abstract mathematicalmodels or inaccurate postulates of the way society operates, thatthey do not understand the societal institutions which propel theeconomy. For instance, the traditional economic principles of a self-regulating economy or perfect competition do not occur in society,but much economic research uses them as bedrock theoreticalaxioms:In economics, deduction drives out empiricism. Thosewho have real empirical curiosity and insight about theworkings of banks, corporations, production technologies,trade unions, economic history, or individual behavior aredismissed as casual empiricists, literary historians, or soci-ologists, and marginalized within the profession. In theirplace departments of economics are graduating a genera-tion of idiots savants, brillant at esoteric mathematics yetinnocent of actual economic life.55Needless to say, these criticisms are not universally applicableand the economics profession is not without convincing rebuttals.\"An indisputable case for the general impact of economics on policy,can be made, of course, by citing the important theoretical and em-pirical work, for instance, of John Maynard Keynes on monetaryand fiscal policy, Walter Heller on revenue sharing, and Joseph A.Pechman on tax policy. The policy relevance of Paul Samuelson'sresearch and explanations of the functioning of capitalist econo-mies is often cited. During the Task Force on Science Policy's hear-ings on behavioral and social science during the Summer of 1985,Herbert Simon, a Nobel prizewinner testified that \"Our theoriesabout how economies operate are far more sophisticated and validthan they were in the 1930s, and the domain of agreement amongeconomistseven those who we think are spread far apart on thespectrumis very large.\" \" Berger, op. cit. p. 14-15.35 Kuttner, Robert.

DECEPTION AND FRAUDFraud and deliberate deception are practices which may influ-ence decisionmakers' perceptions and, ultimately, utilization pat-terns of the behavioral and social sciences. According to one re-searcher, \"...Deception is common in social science research.\"This conclusion, according to Donald P. Warwick a sociologist whohas been affiliated with the Institute of Society, Ethics, and theLife. Sciences in Hastings-on-Hudson, may be \". ..in some areas, virtually the norm.\" He continued:In order to facilitate the collection of data, or to advanceman's knowledge, or to help the oppressed, researcherscondone deception in the laboratory, on the streets, and inour social institutions. They deliberately misrepresent theintent of their experiments, assume false appearances, anduse other subterfuges :..s dubious means to questionableends.5 7Some researchers believe that deliberate deception may be war-ranted as an acceptable data gathering research technique if noother means are feasible.58 But Warwick and others seem to be-lieve that such practices are reprehensible and border on lying.Among the unacceptable practices cited by Warwick and othersare:deliberate public deception, in which scientists lie to thepublic to see if they will behave certain ways (for instance,lying to teachers that some students had lower IQs than theyreally did, to determine if teachers would deliberately treatthese students as if they were of lower IQ and would classifytheir performance as lower than those with falsely labeledhigher IQs);in the laboratory, using \"stooges who pose as fellow subjectsin an experiment \";covert observation, in which scientists gather data while par-ticipating in the daily lives of their subjects without informingthem, such as pretending to be homosexual in a gay bar andthen publishing information about the people they became ac-quainted with.There also have been reported instances of fraud or of \"deliber-ate falsification of data\" in the social sciences.\" Pettigrew illus-trated this ethical dilemma as folloWs:Consider the sociologist who conducted an intense na-tional media campaign against interracial schools ostensi-bly as a scientist reporting on his study of so-called \"whiteflight\" ,(see Pettigrew and Green, 1976). He talked of themotivations of white parents to avoid \"busing, althoughhis research involved no interviews with white parents \" Warwick, Donald P. Social Scientists Ought to Stop Lying.

Worse, no copiesof his reportmuch less his datawere available for fourmonths following the initial public announcement of thestudy upon which the campaign was based.6\u00b0There is no rigorously gathered information to demonstrate thatthe unethical use of these practices is widespread. Abuse appearsto occur in all scientific disciplines involving human subjects, andmay stem, in part, from competition to publish and establish a rep-utation, in orde, to obtain increasingly scarce Federal research dol-lars.\" In order to minimize the negative impacts of these prac-tices, professional societies, such as \"the American Sociological As-sociation and others have proposed ethical guidelines for policy-re-lated social research that requires that the relevant data be imme-diately available for reanalysis by other social scientists.\" 62 TheNational Academy of Sciences also recommends sharing of re-search data to improve the research process and to protect againstfaulty or fraudulent data.\" It should be noted that the use of de-ception as a research technique may have decreased over the lastfew years because now university researchers who need to use de-ception to obtain data are required to obtain approval from institu-tional human subjects review committees at their institutionsbefore commencing their research.64G. POLITICAL OBSTACLES TO EFFECTIVE UTILIZATIONSocial and political values may have more effect on the utiliza-tion of behavioral and social research than, any other factor.Values probably affect all sciences equally since they influence theresearcher's selection of priorities and help to determine the theoryand methodology used.\" The values that will be discussed in thissection affect the utilization of research findings. Most researchand published literature on knowledge utilization had demonstrat-ed that if a finding in behavioral or social research does not coin-cide with the prevailing consensus about the solution w a problem,the finding probably will have little impact. And, at times, deci-sion-makers may even use incorrect or inadequate information if itsupports their viewpoint. Kenneth Prewitt, President of the SocialScience Research Council, expressed this view in 1984:Effectiveness of the social sciences .. often occurs at the point of overlap between the research agenda and thepolitical-economic agenda vf society. ...In ways more 6\u00b0 Pettigrew, Thomas F.

He commented: \"Social science recommendations tend to beaccepted or rejected on a basis other than. that of the inherentquality of the research and conclusions.\" 67 \"Social science operatesbest on public policy when there is a preexisting broad-based con-sensus; it operates worst under conditions of public dissensus.\" 68Political factors affect use, William Morrill noted, at a congression-al seminar when he said that \". .. to the extent that research pro- duces a result which is counter-intuitive or runs counter to tradi-tional values, it is less likely to have an impact on policy.\" 69 TheOECD reached similar conclusions in its series of case studies as-sessing the utilizations of behavioral and social sciences in policy-making in the United States.7\u00b0There are the views that the social research conclusions used todesign and evaluate the so-called \"Great Society\" or \"War on Pov-erty' programs, which began in the 1960s, began to fall into disfa-vor later not because of questions about validity, but because ofgrowing competing claims for use of resources for the Vietnamwar, the economic recession during the late 1970s, and the factsthat the poor and blacks were gaining more access to the powerstructure and, therefore, threatened the existing status quo. Ac-cording to Horowitz, these factors combined effectively to under-Liine the consensus about the need to eradicate poverty.naIt should be noted that some believe that behavioral and socialresearch findings that diverge from the status quo can well be ef-fectively used because they tend to set in motion a serious ques-tioning by critics and interest groups of the premises and outcomesof current policy. Impact may not be discernable immediately. Thishypothesis probably needs to be investigated since the mechanismsoperating here are uncertain and unpredictable.

To the extent that ideas and writing canstir up national concerns they will far more likely be thoseof writers with a mass audience in view like Michael Har-rington (whose The Other America sparked the public \"dis-covery of poverty\") or Rachel Carson (whose books playedan important early part in the environmental movement)or Ralph Nader than of social scientists. When social scien-tists do contribute to creating an atmosphere of urgencyabout a social problem, the factors that are involved are asoften personal experience, conviction, and partisanship asprofessional competence.711. THE MOYNIHAN REPORTThere are many case studies of utilization in both the UnitedStates and abroad, which illustrate the issues discussed immediate-ly above.72 Some cases serve as examples of \"rejection of social sci-ence findings that were generally correct.\" 73 One example is therejectior of the Moynihan study which was conducted by Daniel P.Moynihan, to answer the question of why blacks often failed selec-tive service tests. He concluded that this, as well as socially deviantbehavior such as crime and delinquency, was due in large measureto instability in black familiesthe number of female-headedhouseholds. Moynihan \"then proposed 'a national effort' to en-hance the stability and resources of the black family as a route toremedy.\" However, he did not offer any specific programs or solu-tions.?\" President Lyndon B. Johnson publicly endorsed this view;but the report, after much acrimonious debate, reportedly was \"re-pudiated\" by civil servants and civil rights and black advocates andby others who held the view that \"white racism\" and societal fac-tors were to blame for black plight, and that blacks were not be blamed for their plight. According to Wilson, in 1978, \"to this day,no significant public official will raise the issue, although develop-ments since then have made the initial argument even strong-er.\" 75 Others note however, that economic conditions related todiscrimination helped to foster family instability.2. COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAMS TO STEM JUVENILE DELINQUENCYIn a report published by the National Research Council of theNational Academy of Sciences, Wilson also offered an example ofwhat could be called the premature use of an incomplete body ofsocial science knowledge, which he attributed to coinciding politicalcircumstances, even though the \". .social science theory [on which the research was based] . .. at the time had almost no evi- dence to support it whatsoever and . ..when put to a test, was s1 Berger, op. cit. p. 20.'s Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

There wasat that time a new theory about the causes of delinquencydeveloped [in] a number of important, publicly supportedprojects, notably by Richard Cloward and Lloyd Ohlinfrom the earlier work of Emile Durkheim and RobertMerton. It argued, briefly, that deliquency occurred whenyoung people, denied legitimate means to attain legitimateends, adopted illegitimate means to those ends. The meansavailable were determined by the structure of opportunityavailable at the community level, a structure that could bealtered, and thus improved, by community organization.This idea became the organizing principle for Mobilizationfor Youth in lower Manhattan, which in turn became apartial model for the \"community action agency\" approachto dealing with poverty under the Office of Economic Op-portunity.At the time the theory carried the day, neither Clowardnor Ohlin claimed it was more than a theory. But it hadthe virtue that, true or not, it served the political and or-ganizational needs of a variety of key actors: it seemed tobe addressed to delinquency prevention; it appeared to getat the \"root causes\" of crime; it did not involve reliance onthe allegedly stigmatizing and punitive effect of the crimi-nal justice system; it could draw on the experience and en-thusiasm of social workers and community organizers; itplaced the blame for crime on \"the system\" and not on thejuvenile; it provided a model for direct Federal interven-tion in cities without relying on State Governments andexisting bureacracies; it appealed to various foundationswilling to put their own money into the effort; in additionto reducing crime, it would help mobilize communities tomore effectively cope kith local bureaucracies; and itmight be a way of coordinating and monitoring the deliv-ery of a variety of public services to the poor. The pilotproject, Mobilization for Youth, did a number of thingsabout which there still swirls some controversy. About onething there is no controversy at all: it did not reduce juve-nile delinquency. Indeed because of the multiple motives ofthose who organize the program testing the potential ofcommunity organization to reduce deliquency was never acontrol goal of the effort.773. USE OF BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE IN THE COURTS APPEARSTO BE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING POLITICAL CLIMATEThere are also other cases where behavioral and social informa-tion, whether correct or not, was used if political circumstances dic-tated its use. Collins, for instance, reported that the first use of \" Ibid., p. 87.77 Wilson, p. 87 and 88.2,x3 198social science by the courts was a 1905 Supreme Court decision,Lochner v. New York (198 U.S. 45 [1905]), which found that the em-ployees in bakeries should not be limited to work less than a ten-hour work day because social science information showed thatworking in bakeries was not a hazardous profession in comparizonto other professions. She concluded that the court misused this in-formation because it reflected only \"ideal\" conditions, which usual-ly did not prevail. \". ..Biased research presented in the employ-er's brief circumvented the traditional standard and succeeded ininfluencing a majority of the Court.\" 78Social scientists generally agree that social science information,which really did not prove the point, was used in the 1954 SupremeCourt Brown vs. Board of Education decision because \" 'separatebut equal' was an ideological posture that, for political reasons, wasno longer accepted.\" \" According to several scholars, the researchthat was used (ccaducted by Kenneth Clark) and cited by theNAACP and that showed a discriminatory effect of segregation(children's preferences for white or black dolls), was not germane.Horowitz and Katz concluded:..The Court made its decision on the basis of its senseof the effect of segregation and the requirements of theFourteenth Amendment. ... But social science was notthe foundation of the decision; it was used to lend weightto what the justices clearly wore persuaded was true: thatsegregated education is Linequal education. ... TheSu- preme Court is, then, a policymaking body, and like anysuch body it recognizes that there is no truth or untruth,no right or wrong, that there are only degrees of each.8\u00b0Specifically according to Collins \". .. the social researchcould have served as a political placebo. Passed off as an objective basisfor such a revolutionary decision, the Court could have merely in-jected the research to soothe the public mind Laid remove part ofthe blame from the Court.\" 81Most observers agree that the use of social science information inthe Brown vs. Board of Edunation case did set significant prece-dents which legitimized subsequent widespread attempts to usesocial science in court decisions.82 There are differences of opinionabout whether such information has been used effectively in subse-quent court decisions. A National Academy of Sciences report ob-served that there are instances in v. ich unverified scientific re- search results have been used in policymakingfor instance in aSupreme Court decision to reinstate the death penaltyeventhough subsequent research invalidated the work.\" In 1978, Col- \"Collins, Sharon M.

COLEMANSocial science findings which do not coincide with the prevailingvalues and views of politicians in power may fall by the waysideand not be used, at least in the short term. There are several ex-amples. James Coleman, a sociologist, in a manuscript for a forth-coming book, reported that the findings of three of his researchstudies on education, conducted in the 1960s and 1970s, were notaccepted by policy-makers because they contradicated prevailingsocial views or conceptualizations of problem solution. These werestudies, some of which were funded by the Federal Government,which showed (1) most student achievement was determined moreby parent's commitment to education than to the dollar amount ofresources allocated to individual schools; (2) school desegrationpolicy causes \"white flight\" to the suburbs; and (3) students whoattend private schools, especially Catholic schools, are betterachievers than those who attend public schools. The major detrac-tors to his studies were, in the case of (1) and (2) supporter of deseg-regation policies, especially the NAACP, and in the case of (3)public school teachers and the National Education Association,which did not want to see public school support eroded.88 Criti-cisms have been made of his methodologies and conclusions,\" butthe general view is that his findings did not coincide with policysolutions deemed optimal at the time by the legislative and execu-tive branches. However, it appears as if the studies may have influ-enced the judicial branch.5. THE CASE OF INTELLIGENCE TESTINGThe following case study of the development and use of intelli-gence tests illustrates how a scientific technique, originally of lim-ited application, came to be used, or misused, because of prevailingsocial and political values even though it was not wholly endorsedby the psychology community.For many years the application of the intelligence test (I.Q.) tosupport various prejudices of class, race, or human potential haveobscured the basic questions: What is intelligence? Can anyonemeasure it? Does intelligence change over time? Is the best predic-tor of success a single measure of intelligence, or should valid pre-dictors of success measure multiple skills and attributes? Thesequestions persist today.a. Development of the technology for intelligence testingIn 1904, Alfred Binet, Director of the psychology laboratory atthe Sorbonne, was commissoned \"to develop techniques for identi-fying those children whose lack of success in formal classroomssuggested the need for some form of special education.\"\" Binet has 83 Chapter 2.

Children were tested individually. Binet sought to develop atest which would separate intelligence level from the effects ofschooling. The age assigned to the last completed task became thechild's mental age, which was subtracted from chronological age.In 1911, a German psychologist revised the scale when he dividedmental age by chronological age, the yield an appropriate relativemeasure. Thereafter the measure was called the intelligence quo-tient or I.Q.In The Mismeasure of Man, Stephen J. Gould noted that Binetcautioned that scores should not be used to rank or label children.Intelligence was too complicated to be captured by one number.But, when Binet's scale was brought to the United States, it beganan evolution which has been described as a \"major misuse of sci-ence in our century.\" 92b. Social environment in America circa 1910-30In order to understand the application of the Binet Scale, it isnecessary to review the social movements, problems, and concernsemerging in America society between 1910 and 1930. Public schooleducation was undergoing a radical change in philosophy andnumber of students. High school enrollment quadrupled from 1910to 1930.93 The use of one standard curriculum was challenged.With the introduction of child labor laws and the movement toexpand the scope of public education, a problem emerged. How toarrange and educate the influx of children from different back-grounds, with different abilities and futures? According to Novak,until the mid-1920s \". .. America in its top and middle layers hadbeen, politically and culturally, a fairly homogeneous society.\" 94But growing immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe en-countered racism and prejudice. Some felt that the immigrationflow had to be managed.At the same time, genetics became a modern science with the re-publication of Mendel's research and the work of Galton andjDarwin. This gave the popular \"social eugenics\" movementagroup which said that heredity determined behaviora scientificbasis for its campaign to promote the quality of the Americanpeople by weeding out so-called genetically inferior \"degenerates.\"These were believed to include criminals, paupers, alcoholics, thefeeble-minded and the insane. These people were to be discouragedfrom breeding. But a crucial question remained: how could \"fit\"and \"unfit\" be accurately quantified? 91 Ibhi, passim.99 Gould, op. cit. p. 155.99 Boyer, Ernest L. High School.

New York, collier Books, 1971. p. 170. 202The quantification and widespread application of the Binet scalegave some researchers a false sense that I.Q. number scores meas-ured intelligence and other factors that presumably were deter-mined by heredity. This is called the \"reification of intelligence.\"Basically the public believed that if there was a measure, then itwas assumed that the professionals knew what they were measur-ing.c. New generations of the L Q. testThe key to the creation of mass intelligence testing from Binet'sindividual test was the Army Alpha and Beta tests. They were de-veloped by a group of psychologists, including Lewis Terman, devel-oper of the Stanford-Binet scale, and H.H. Goddard. The tests weredesigned specifically to determine the abilities of the Army recruitswho participated in the massive build-up for World War. I. Thewritten Alpha and the picture Beta were supposed to indicatewhich recruits would be good officers. The tests' validity and reli-ability have been questioned. But their use, alone, accomplishedthree things for the discipline of psychology. It showed that massadministration of a standard test could be accomplished. Second,the test results became the core of a data base that would be usedwidely in psychological research. And third, publication of the dataresults was used by some psychologists and administrators whoconcluded that intelligence was ethnically determined.\"The I.Q. scores of different nationalities and races were com-pared and contrasted. The influence of nature versus nurture onintelligence became an issue. Walter Lippmann and Lewis Termanwere drawn into a debate which appeared for over a year in thepages of The Atlantic, the New Republic, and other publications.\"Although there was some challenge to the tests and the data analy-sis in professional journals, a concept of intelligence had been ac-cepted.By World War II the use of mass intelligence testing had becomea widely used and, according to some reports, effective testing pro- cedure in American society. It should be noted that suLsequent re-finements of the I.Q. test and related skill or ability tests are gen-erally considered to have been valid and effectively used. There issome evidence that many World War II U.S. Army Air Force pilot trainee's lives were saved by implementing aptitude testing toscreen out persons without the aptitude for flying.\" There are also studies which describe the benefits of using specialized aptitudetests in educational placement and employment selection.\"However, historically the original I.Q. test was used, erroneouslysome believe, to legitimate some decisions or to justify popular be- 93 Cronbach, Lee J.

Despite controversy, the test and the reification of a conceptof intelligence came to aid in the solution of some policy problemsin the areas of education, immigration, and institutionalization.Several examples are described next.d. Use of the I.Q. test in educationSchool administrators used an I.Q. test, the National IntelligenceTests, designed by Terinan, Yerkes, Thorndike, and others. The re-sults frequently were used to rank students of different ethnicbackgrounds according to intelligence and the potential for learn-ing. Curricula were modified to create different tracks or \"educa-tional streams.\" \"The testers intended to shield the child destinedto be a worker from the rigors of an academic curriculum,\" stztedLee J. Cronbach. He noted that \". .. thewisdom of sorting pupils into distinct programs deserved public scrutiny it did not get.Streaming was the obvious answer to the problem of laggards anddrop-outs in the efficiency-minded decade.\" The I.Q. test provideda solution, and the growing controversy over heritability of intelli-gence obscured the philosophical issues and questions of validity ofthe test.Educational use of intelligence and aptitude tests has been anarea of continuing controversy. Arthur Jensen's article in HarvardEducational Review in 1969,\"How Much Can We Boost I.Q. andScholastic Achievement?\" unleashed a new volley in the natureversus nurture controversy. References to the differences in the av-erage I.Q. scores of blacks and whites focused on questions of he-redity.Over the decades geneticists and psychologists have challengedand revised the view of the dominance of heredity as the sole deter-minant of intelligence. Current studies view intelligence as a \"poly-genic model,\" where several genes work together to create a traitor where I.Q. is a measure of many separate abilities, some ofwhich are determined by the social environment.'\" And there isevidence that one form of mental retardation, specifically pheylke-tonuria (PKU), results from a gene-environment interaction, whichmay be corrected by early detection and appropriate diet. PKU canbe detected at birth. As of 1970, 43states had mandatory PKU- screening laws.1\u00b01e. Use of the I.Q. test in immigration policyC.C.

Although arecent analysis attempts to refute the conclusion that I.Q. testswere important in the formulation of immigration policies,'\"there were widespread perceptions at the time that these testswere important influences on major parties to policy decisions. Inaddition the Encyclopedia of Bioethics noted that the ImmigrationRestriction Act of 1924 had a selective restriction clause \"whichlimited the entry of individuals from Southern and Eastern Europeon the grounds that they were biologically inferior.\" 1\u00b04 Cronbachconcluded, however, that the more restrictive immigration lawwould have been enacted even without the Army data.1\u00b05f Use of the I.Q. test in policies for the feeble-mindedMany of the psychologists who led in the design of intelligencetests, were also involved in the debates of the eugenics movement.Intelligence, as measured by the I.Q. test, became accepted bymany as a fixed, genetically determined trait carried by one gene.A person's potential could be predicted early in life.The studies of H. H. Goddard, conducted at the Vineland Train-ing School for Feeble-minded Girls and Boys, contributed a vitallink in the theory. In The Kallikak Family: A Study in the Hered-ity of Feeble-mindedness, written in 1912, Goddard assumed thatthere was a single, linear measure of intelligence, something Binethad not intended, and that intelligence was a unitary gene trait,along the lines of Menders work. Making these assumptions, heconstructed a genealogy of the Kallikak family based upon Binetscores of a child in the institution, interviews with family mem-bers, and hear-say about the behavior of deceased family members,From this he concluded there was a hereditary basis to feeblemindedness.1\u00b0 6 \"3 See Synclerman, M., and R.

They concluded in part \"Summarizing ourexamination of the Congressional Record and Committee Hanngs. There is no mention of Intelligence testing in the Act, test results on immigrants appear only briefly in the committee hearings and are then largely ignored or cnticized, and they are brought up only once in over 600pages of congressional floor debate, where they are subjected to further criticism without rejoir.-der. None of them ajor contemporary figures in testingH. H. Goddard, Lewis Terman, RobertYerkes, E. L. Thorndike, and so onwere called to testify, nor were any of their writings inserted into the legislative record. The overlapping distributions of test Set. res for various nationaland racial populauons woald probably have created more problems Ix- the Act's proponentsthan for its opponents, which may help explain why the intelligence testing movement of theearly 20th century left so few traces in thi. record. The examples of fascism occasionally evidentin both early psychometric writing and the Immigration Act do not appear to be casually related to each other. Rather, each reflects in its own way a crest in the long history of AmericanAnglo-Saxonism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-Semitism, following World War I (Highman, 19'73)We have examir ad, and found wanting, two common allegations about ir_elligence testing inits early days, namely, that the hereditanan interpretation of ethnic and racial differences wertlargely unchallenged- and that those differences were a significant factor in the passage of theImmigration Act of 1924. But the historical reco.d contains challenges aplenty, even amongtester, and nothing in the record suggests an important role for tests in the frrmulation or enacment of immigration policy. The allegations are usually offered as evidence of the s.nister influence of tests and of their affinity to reprehensible political purposes, in this case a restrictiveimmigration law. Even if the allegations were true, it would be an odd argumenta form ofguilt by associationto blame the tests rather than the political process that allegedly appropriated them for reprehensible ends. But, as it turns out, the record fails to show testing ruiltilyassociated as charged.\"104 Ludmerer, Kenneth, M. History of Eugenics. In Reich, Warren T, ed Encyclopedia ofBioethics, v. 1.

Rockville, Aspen Publications, 1985. 210 205Many professionals accepted the basic assumptions of his re-search and the notion that heredity determined feeble-mindedness.The validity of his scale was challenged by Terman and the accura-cy of his interviews was suspect. But Goddard's work supportedsterilization of the feeble-minded as a makeshift public policy solu-tion to the spread of feeble-mindedness until all the feeble-mindedcould be segregated into colonies, such as his own institution.In Buck v. Bell, a 1927 Supreme Court case involving the State ofVirginia and a young woman committed to the State Colony forEpileptics and Feeble-minded, the Court upheld the State's right tocompulsory sterilization of an individual judged to be defective.'\"Evidence in the case included test scores indicating mental age,family history, information gathered by a field worker of the Eu-genics Recora Office, and references to Goddard's Kallikak study.Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stated in the majority opinion that\"The principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broadenough to cover cutting the fallopian tubes. ...Three generations of imbeciles is enough.\" 108 As of 1931, thirty states had passedcompulsory sterilization measures as applied to \"hereditary defec-tives.\" 1\u00b09 The poli,:y of institutional sterilization continued in Vir-ginia into the early 1970s.The Supreme Court has never overruled the Buck versus Bell de-cision, but the case appears to have become generally unacceptableprecedent in light of current interpretations of basic civil rightslaw. The social values of the present time have also changed withrespect to concepts of equal protection rights and the place of men-tally retarded persons in society. This is illustrated by the follow-ing case.In the July 1, 1985, Supreme Court decision regarding the City ofCleburne, Texas, versus Cleburne Living Center, Inc., it was ruledthat requiring a special use permit for a proposed group home forthe mentally retarded would deprive the residents of the equal pro-tection of the laws. The city had sought to classify the group homeas a \"hospital for the feeble-minded\" under the established cityzoning code. The Supreme Court found that \"requiring the permitin this case appears to rest on an irrational prejudice against thementally retarded.\" 110 In the concurring judgment of JusticesMarshall, Brennan, and Blackmun, the studies of Goddard andTerman are cited as sources of the questionable view that the\"feeble-minded\" are a menace to society and civilization. ...re- sponsible in a large degree for many, if not all, of our social prob-lems:, 111In its opinion, the court cited an alternative definition for mentalretardation, with four classifications according to I.Q., and men-tioned that \"mental retardation is not defined by reference to intel-ligence or I.Q. alone, however.\" I went on to state that it is causedby a \"variety of factors, some genetic, some environmental, andsome unknown.\"112 Clearly advances in diagnostic science, im- 107 Smith, op. cit. p. 139.1\u00b02 Smith, op. cit. p. 150.1\u00b02 Ludmerer, Eugenics, P. 459.

APPROACHES TO ENHANCE UTILIZATION OFBEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL RESEARCH IN POLICYMAKINGThe material presented in the last chapter summarized the com-plex factors which affect the actual utilization of behavioral andsocial research in policymaldng as well as measurement of use.Some of these factors are inherently contradictory, thus theypresent serious dilemmas to research utilization. Research informa-tion may be perceived as irrelevant to policymaking because it istoo piecemeal or not representative, yet wholistic research or basicresearch may take too long to complete and may not address orga-nizational or political aspects of decisionmaking which affect utili-zation. Often recommendations are rejected for political infeasibil-ity or because decisionmakers prefer scientists to be neutral andobjective, yet knowledge may not come to the attention of decision-makers unless scientists become involved with application or imple-mentation. Research knowledge may be rejected as a guide topolicy change if it does not cCncide with or reinforce the prevailingconsensus or views about problem solution. This may constitute apriori rejection of information which challenges the status quo orgovernmental policies.Summarized in this chapter are some major recommendationsthat have been made to enhance utilization of the behavioral andsocial sciences in policymaking. These may help overcome some,but certainly not all, of the obstacles and dilemmas identified inthe previous chapter. The chapter deals with: expanding govern-mental support for anticipatory basic research and related studies,lowering expectations for utilization, improving the intelligibility ofreports, considering the issue of implementation, improving link-ages between decisionmakers and scientists, creating Government-funded policy research units, improving information dissemination,addressing the notion of research broker, use of other media, andpolicy sciences. It also includes a summary and concluding com-ments on utilization.A. THE NEED To FUND MORE RELEVANT, LONG-TERM, ANTICIPATORYRESEARCH WHILE MEETING GOVERNMENT NEEDS FOR SHORT-RANGE STUDIESEfficiency and effectiveness of utilization would be enhanced, ac-cording to most observers, if Government priorities and funding forbehavioral and social research and development focussed more onthe major problems Government confronts. Such a reorientationcalls essentially for more longer-range, anticipatory, and generally,basic research. For instance, in a National Academy of Sciencesstudy, Wilson concluded that Federal agencies ought to support theconduct of more anticipatory social research, and social experimen-tation long before the bureaucracy needs to make programmatic or(207)2 13 wiwir Ni......-=1Nm. 208policy decisions.' Similarly it was concluded in the National Acade-my of Scienc,:s report Behavioral and Social Science Research: ANational Resource that even though there is an \"uncertain, incom-plete, and often slow ...coupling between basic research inthe behavioral and social sciences and its applications to publicpolicy....\" this Ink is \"significant and growing.\" 2 As a result`... a disinterested, long-term program of support carried out as abroad, farsighted investment policy rather than to moet the imme-diate policy objectives of particular agencies, is in the national in-terest.\" 3These are not insignificant recommendaL:ons, L view of the factthat on average for the last twenty years, 70 percent of Federalsupport for behavioral and social sciences has custc marily gone tosupport applied work, and far less, that is about 30 percent, hasgone to support basic research.The final report of the Study Commission on .91cial R&D ad-dressed this issue. It noted that, the Federal Goverr..nent needs tofund both long-range and short-range research in order to be ableto respond to the needs of the policy process, but that additionalinvestments in \"research that requires longer time for a significantreturn\" needs to be considered. The report concluded that \"Theneed to devise ways of supporting such longer-term research is an unresolved issue of federal investment in knowledge of social prob-lems.\" 4 The Commission made a series of recommendations to helpagencies manage and allocate their research resources for thesefields. They are premised on the assumptions that agencies: (1)should use different kinds of criteria to fund policy oriented as op- posed to longer range basic research, (2) need to develop mecha-nisms to coordinate agenda setting among the various offices' andbureaus' users of information and (3) should plan ahead to maxi-mize the application and use of research information in decision-making. The recommendations are:Federalresearchadministrators and oversight officials should devote more resources to developing systematic plan-ning as a distinct aspect of efforts to produce and use knowl-edge of social problems.Program decision makers should have greater input into theplanning of program-supporting research and policy makers atthe departmental and presidential levels and in Congressshould have greater input into the planning of policy-formingresearch.Special attention should be given to building problem-explor-ing research agendas through task forces and conferences andthe creation of presidential or joint presidential-congressionaltemporary commissions.A number of problem-centered research programs should becreated to undertake intensive and sustained work on majorsocial problems.

One is to support =Le fundamental theoreticalwork. One of the major conclusions to emerge from Berger's assess-ment of the case studies in the OECD study, The Utilisation of theSocial Sciences in Policy Making in the United States, is that in thecurrent era of budgetary stringency \"policymakers are tempted toresort to [funding] those kinds of research that produce predictableresults, rather than to fund the open-ended and often apparentlyunspecified efforts that might (or might not) lead to new para-digms.\" This produces the \"new illusion\", leading to inefficiencyand ineffectiveness in research investments, \"that scientists canwork out of the stock of existing theories with a high return forpublic policy.\" 6She identified the most useful, effective, and efficient kind of re-search as \"paradigm challenging\" work' research whose outcomecannot be specified in advance and that fundamentally is long-range and basic in nature because it gives \"maximum latitude tothe researchers. . ..\"5 This kind of research is important, butposes a fundamental dilemma since it is \"the research that chal-lenges the established assumptions, theories, and practices underly-ing policy [and] has the highest pay-off for the policymakers.\" 9Unlike other kinds of social research \"paradigm challenging\" re-search can point out weaknesses in current policy and identify newsolutions. Berger elaborated as follows:...[T]he pay-off for the development of new paradigmsmay be very high indeed, not only for science but forpolicy. When new paradigms replace old ones, facts andmethodologies which once appeared irrelevant to the un-derstanding and solution of a problem may be revealed tobe critical. The bimultaneous existence of uncrt ploymentand unfilled jobs in the urban ghetto, a fact that neoclassi-cal labour market theory (to the extent that it noticed it atall) treated as anomalous and transitory, in the new duallabour market theories become a key to the operations ofthe system. To continue with this example, policy-makerswho adopted the new paradigm would find themselvesforcedtocollectstatisticsdifferent from those they 6 The Federal Investment in Knowledge of Social Problems, op. cit., 1978, p. 5-6.6 Berger, op. cit., p. 24.A term whose origin she attributed to Martin Rein in Values, Social Science and SocialPolicy.

Most important, the new theory opens the prospect of new strategies for action, since the variable it identifies as critical to the problem are different from those which the old policies had attempted to manipulate. In this way, new theories enlarge the set of alternatives available to policy-makers and widen the range of political choice.\"1\u00b0There is also the belief that it is the Federal Government's re- sponsibility to support more \"generic\", longer range social re- search, that produces findings \"generalizable across disciplines\" and agencies. Tornatzky and Solomon, who wrote about this issue, said however, that more effective interagency coordination would be needed to achieve these objectives.\" This issue was addressed also during hearings held by the Task Force on Science Policy on the subject of the behavioral and social sciences by Clark C. Abt, president of Abt Associates,a consulting firm. He testified that \"Government social science R&D is undertasked on our most im- portant social and economic problems, yet overcommitted to the more marginal issues of social problem administration. Congress,he recommended should rectify this situation by asking \"the most important national economic and social policy questions of the social science R&D community,\" including cross-cutting R&D \"which is not part of any single agency's or discipline's mis- sion... .12A recommendation for the Congress, through the Congressional Budget Office, (CBO) to contract for and oversee the execution of some social policy research was made by James S. Coleman, at these same hearings. Coleman, a social scientist with the Universi- ty of Chicago and the National Opinion Research Center, justified this recommendation as follows:First, since policy is made in Congress through legisla-tion, then Congress is a natural locus for such research; and second, the multi-headed character of Congress which for some purposes is a defect is an asset here, for it can Berger, op. cit., p. 24.ii Tornatzky and Solomon, op. cit., P. 9.'2 Abt, Clark C, Improving Government Efficiency With Social Sciences Research, Testimony to the Committee on Science and Technology, U.S. Houses of Representatives, Sept. 18, 1985. Abt identified top 12 fundamental issues, which he sa.d require crosscutting social R&D. In some cases he suggested the agency's that could utilitze the research:1. Deficit reduction integrated with fairer and more productive taxes.2. Better, more widely shared and more affordable health care.3 Reversing the decline of the American family, now with onefifth of all births illegitimate. 4. Preventing the corruption of the youth by drugs.5. Improved educational productivity.6. The social and economic security of the elderly.7 Countermeasures and deterrents to international terrorism and nu;threat to become nucle- ar.8.

Continuation of United States world moral leadership supporting justice, peace, prosperity, and freedom for all nations.(Ibid., pp. 8-9.)2x6 211helpinsure the pluralismof social,policyresearch design.'3Scott and Shore attributed much of the ineffective use of sociolo-gy to social scientists themselves. Social scientists, they said, shoulddo research which is both \"relevant\" and \"interesting\" not only\"interesting.\" This does not preclude doing basic work or maintain-ing scientific freedom and independence. But it means doing re-search about fundamental issues that need to be resolved beforepolicy can be enacted, and generating knowledge which \"enablesthe sociologist to anticipate and study in advance issues and ques-tions that eventually come up in polio deliberations.\" 14 They identified these fundamental issues as follows:goals (i.e., what shall be the objective of a program?); cov-erage (i.e., who shall benefit?); finaticing (i.e., how shall theprogram be administered); who (i.e., who shall be responsi-ble for implementing the program and how shall it be putinto effect?); equity (i.e., of those who are covered by theprogram, who shall receive what kinds of benefits?); andtime frame (i.e., for what period of time shall the programlast?) '5Several other kinds of social science research were cited as espe-cially relevant to policand warrant more attention and fundingaccording to several witnesses at hearings held in 1985 by the TaskForce on Science Policy on the s:'liect of Behavioral and Social Re-search. One type is longitudinal studiesfor instance following \"anappropriate sample of children and adolescents ... over aperiod of years, perhaps even decades . ..\" to identify events in life, or how societal interventions affect social behavior. Neil J. Smelser,University Professor of Sociology at the University of California,Berkeley, during the House Committee hearings, identified longitu-dinal studies as especially critical to understand why criminal ca-reers may be started and how factors such as probation, imprison-ment, educational programs, or community development programsaffect or deter criminal behavior.\"Expanding governmental funding for social experimentation maybe another way to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Fed-eral investments in policy relevant behavioral and social research.Joseph P. Newhouse testified at the same hearing that \". .. ex- periments are quite rare. In my view, they are too rare. I believe acertain modest portionperhaps 11 to 20 percent of research budg-ets for applied public policy researchshould be set aside for ran-domized experiments.\" He suggested that the Government rarelyfunds such experiments now because \"they take a long time toyield results ...,\" they appear expensive, and they may be politi-cally risky.17 12 Testimony, p. 9.14 Scott and Shore, op. p. 211.11/ Ibid., p. 209.le September 17,1985, pp. 5-6.\" Newhouse, Joseph P.

Wilson described in detail how long-range research might have enhanced the work of three commis-sions.The Kerner Commission, the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, was asked by President Johnson to discover \"the basic causes and factors leading to 'civil disorders.' \" It concludedthat \"white racism,\" was the cause, and that it led to segregation;black migration to big cities, accompanied by white exodus; and im-poverished ghettos. Wilson contended that data did not demon-strate these conclusions.He also reported that the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence produced 15 volumes of excellent re- search, but that its conclusions were not based on this research, but \"on unexamined causal premises, untested ideas, and iirstated facts.\" For instance, Wilson said that the commission recommend-ed that major infusions of welfare expenditures would halt violence(an unproven assertion) and that the commission's recommenda-tions that there be less violence on television and in movies was not supported by thee research done by the commission.The obscenity commission, according to Wilson \"recommendedrepeal of federal, state, or local laws prohibiting the sale, exhibition, or distribution of sexual materials to consenting adults,\"basing its recommendations on research it had conddcted. Howev-er, according to Wilson, the research findings were inadequate:\"long-term effects could not be investigated by a commission with only a two-year existence; there were almost no studies of the ef- fects on children; and the behavior of volunteer ...\" subjects in experiments could not be generalized to any known population.\" 28Robert K. Merton, a sociologist with long experience, recom- mended that in order to accumulate the kind of knowledge commis-sions of this nature need, the professional associations, the Ameri-can Sociological Association, and the Social Science Research Coun-cil, and other \". ..organizations should take it upon themselves,separately or in concert to initiate continuing research programs designed for use by functional equivalents of government commis-sicns.\" This work could be done independent of the \"immediacies ofpolit;cal expediency\" and it \". ..could generate terms of reference for programs of policy-oriented research in the particular sphere ofa problem, without the strong pressures of urgency that have typi-cally limited work done directly for Congressional and PresidentialCommissions. \" '0 The American Anthropological Association en- dorse.' these views.\" \" Wilson, Social Science and Public Policy, op. cit., pp. 84-85.\" Merton, Robert K.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR 'LOWER EXPECTATIONSThere is also the view that policymakers as well as social scien-tists have held overly ambitious expectations of what the social sci-ences can contribute to policymaking.21 The point of view has beenexpressed by some U.S. as well as foreign behavioral and social sci-entists.22 Some, including those who are scientists with long expe-rience servi.-.g. Government's behavioral and social science informa-tion needs, have recommended that expectations be curtailed. Her-bert A. Simon, a psychologist and economist, and Nobel prizewin-ner, wrote in an essay published in 1982, that social science cancontribute answers to specific programmatic issuesfor instancecompensatory education, problems of aging, some aspects of crimi-nal behavior, and organizational decisionmaking. But it cannot domuch to help government solve the major enduring societal prob-lems such as war, deterrence, poverty, and disease.23Lines Q. Wilson concluded that behavioral and social scientists'best work for Government consists of evaluating, and not designingnew programs or policies:To me, social scientists are at their best when theyevaluate an actual government program, when they askwhat happens when the government does x, y, or z. They're at their worst when they assume that measuringvariables in a situation will tell them what will happenwhen one of the variables changes. 24Daniel P. Moynihan, now senior senator from New York, came toa similar conclusion when he was a practicing social scientist: \"Therole of social sciences lies not in the formulation of social policy,but in the measurement of its results.\" 25 His views, undoubtedly,were shaped by the criticisms made of his work. The Moynihanreport concluded that social deviance among blacks was caused bya breakdown in the black family structure. This view was political-ly unacceptable and the report, as a result was politically discredit-ed, since at that time, the conclusions diverged from what was ex-pected: that the fault would lie with society and, the solution witheradicating issues of economic and social prejudice.C. THE NEED To IMPROVE THE INTELLIGIBILITY OF REPORTSThere are also recommendations that social scientists should im-pro% e the intelligibility of their reports by avoiding lengthy jargon-laden tomes. Several social scientists have addressed this point, forinstance Marc Roberts:...I want to urge the demystification of social science.Communication with nonexperts has to become a responsi-bility of all scientists, social and naturala responsibility 21 See for instance, the series of views in the symposium on. Is Social Science A God ThatFailed? Public Opinion, Oct./Nov., 1981. 11-15. See es,iecially the views of Irving Kristol, p. 12.22 See for instance: 'Callen, D.B.P. et. al., eds.

New York, The Free Press, 1969, p. 193. 214which is shirked when experts are not explicit about therole of values and judgments in their work, and use jargon and mathematics as professional status symbols. There isno reason to put something in a complex and inaccessiblemanner when the argument is inherently simple and po-tentially easy to understand. The problems of democraticpolicymaking are difficult enough without this added com- plication.26In addition, sometimes social research \"investigators ...regard a research 'mint as a personal benefice rather than a commitmentto produce ...nowledge;\" and then there are some \". .. government sponsors ... who try to cover up research reports that reveal theiragencies or programs in an unfavorable light.\" 27D. THE NEED To CONSIDER ISSUES OF IMPLEMENTATIONThe implementation issue means basically that the utilization ofbehavioral and social science information in policymaking may beconstrained if researchers do not specify or suggest decision op-tions, if they do not study and make recommendations regardingalternatives in the design, administration and implementation of aprogram, and if program follow-up is not conducted. This set of con-clusions is based on the notion that means and ends in achievingpolicy objectives are interrelated and that behavioral and social sci-entists need to be concerned about both. There have been a numberof useful case studies dealing with this issue, notably a study onthe Economic Development Administration in Oakland, California,as described in the book Implementation by Pressman and Wil-daysky 28 and in Hargrove's review.\"Some researchers suggest that weak linkages between socialtheory and social policy will continue until deliberate attempts aremade to involve social researchers in implementation, so that theycan explore the effects of program options on achieving desired out-comes in the real world, in a process al to the developmentphase of natural and physical sciences research and development.However, the costs of such an approach and the commitment re-quired by both scientists and policymakers probably would be enor-mous. A current issue which illustrates the necessity for follow-through on implementation is the problem associated with deinsti-tutionalization of mental health patients. Increased use of drugtherapy permitted patients to leave hospitals, but, some observershave concluded, there was little anticipation of the need to main-tain community mental health centers and support networks forpeople who could cope only marginally with social demands. As aresult, the number of deinstitutionalized people who are living onthe streets appears to have increased markedly.\" se Roberts p. 62, in Knew, op. cit., p. 538. See also Andreski, Stanislay.

There are so many resistances to over-come, many of which should have been anticipated, butmany of us were blinded by our ideology into thinking wecould have our utopia in one fell swoop of mandatedbusing. Simply mixing children in the classroom and trust-ing to a benign human nature could never have done thetrick....Social scientists have to start learning how toengineer effective integration. ... We in thesocial sci- ences have missed the essential R and D link in the chainof applying ideas to practical problems. ... We are going to have to follow something of the implementation modelused by the hard sciences so that when we make recom-mendations about how to deal with an issue like schoolsegregation, we have the facts and experience to back usup. This can only be done with careful research . ..and try to apply it on a small scale at first to the school settingwith a laboratory-like approach. ...In the process we will be forced to go back to the drawing board many timesuntil we develop a program that will really work.\"If it is necessary for social scientists to do work in implementa-tion then many would have to delve into program and policy for-mulation and administration, fields that may be quite alien totheir previous training and experience. They also risk losing orbeing accused of losing, their objectil'.1 and credibility. As aresult, some scientists avoid recommending policy options.E. THE NEED FOR IMPROVED LINKAGES BETWEEN DECISIONMAKERSAND SCIENTISTSThere is a considerable body of literature in the social sciences,especially in the field of program evaluation, which counsels thatdissemination and utilization will be enhanced if decisionmakersare involved in the research: mutually defining the problem andstudy objectives with researchers and, during the analysis phase,seeking the contribution of decisionmakers or users in drawing con-clusions.3 2F. GOVERNMENT-FUNDED POLICY RESEARCH UNITS To ENHANCEDECISIONMAKINGThere have been several attempts by Federal agencies to set uppolicy oriented research institutes to develop an anticipatory,policy oriented body of research findings. For instance, amongthese institutional innovations are the Rand Corporation that was \" Gerard, Harold B. School Desegregation. The Social Science Role.

The UrbanInstitute was created in 1968 with funding supplied by the Depart-ment of Housing and Urban Development. There were also theWisconsin Institute for Research on Toverty, funded by the Officeof Economic Opportunity; the Office of Education's R&D Centers,educational labs, and educational policy centers; and the Social andRehabilitation Service's regional research institutes.33 These unitshave had mixed results. Some, however, have earned notable re-spect in policymaking communities. Generally they were awardedlong-term research support of about five years or more, generalprogram guidelines were mutually agreed upon, but researcherstypically were given considerable latit de to choose their owntopics for study.34There have been several recommendations over the last thirtyyears to create other \"generic\" social policy oriented researchunits. The BASS committee of the National Academy of Science, in1970, recommended the formation of a Graduate School of AppliedBehavioral Science one large and diffuse academically orientedresearch institute in Washington, to conduct multidisciplinary re-search dealing with social problems.35 Shortly thereafter, the Na-tional Science Board of the National Science Foundation called forthe creation of several research units throughout the country de-signed to conduct research in a particular functional area for theGovernment and other clients.\" There have been other proposalsto create new institutions to conduct social or interdisciplinarypolicy research for the Government at various levels. These arebased on the presumption that existing funding programs do notprovide the Government with the kind of research it needs and;..!,at these units would provide better interaction between scientistsand decisionmakers. These proposals were summarized in a reportof the House Committee on Science and Astronautics in 1974:These proposals include, for instance, the recommenda-tion of the House Committee on Science and Astronauticsto create a National Institutes of Research and AdvancedStudies, and Etzioni and Remp's proposal for an Agencyfor Technological Development. Alton Frey, a political sci-entist, has made a related proposal, to establish an earlywarning Institute for the Congress, staffed by experts whowould do in-house research for legislative committees onmajor problems. One of the special features of Frey's Pro-posal deserves attention: policy reports would assess thepolitical connotation of various policy alternatives.37Recent recommendations have included a suggestion to establishnational interdisciplinary supercomputer centers to do advancedwork in such areas as brain mapping, language studies, neuralstudy, and developmental psychology. These proposals were offeredby R. Duncan Luce, Victor S.

THE NEED FOR BI HER INFORMATION DISSEMINATION'Federal agencies have also set up a variety of formal arrange-ments to improve utilization by enhancing the distribution of socialresearch findings within an agency. These were surveyed by Weissin 1978. For instance, in 1972-1973, the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare required research managers to write policyimplication papers (PIPS) including statements of the implicationsfor policy of the research they had funded. These were to be dis-tributedtomanagersthroughoutthedepartment.\"PIPSflopped...\" according.to Weiss because:Not only was the work load severe, but also the researchmanagers did not know what programs were run in theenormous department, who ran them, what their policieswere, or what research might relate to them. Further,they were acutely uncomfortable trying to generalizepolicy recommendations for other people's programs onthe basis of one or two studies.\"There were other kinds of dissemination mechanisms: an ab-stracting service established by the Office of the Assistant Secre-tary for Planning and Evaluation in the Department of Health,Education, and Welfare during the early 1970s; followed by an NSFprogram to fund critical syntheses of policy oriented interdiscipli-nary social research.41 None of these systems were maintained,perhaps because they were not very effective. Weiss also reportedthat Nathan Caplan studied the utility of computerized informa-tion systems in helping to disseminate social research reports andconcluded they \"seem to be of little use to decisionmakers.\" 42The \"ineffective and uncoordinated\" dissemination of the resultsof social research and development was one of the major factorsthat hindered the utilization of social research and development inthe Department of Heath, Education, and Welfare, according tothe General Accounting Office in a 1977 report to the Congress.43H.

Failure was attributed not to the quality of the data, butto lack of communication of information through the bureaucracyfrom a trusted aide or equivalent in the bureaucratic structure.44This problem is exacerbated because, as a considerable body ofliterature demonstrates, research utilization is often hampered be-cause decisionmakers do not know how to use it. For instance, inhis study on the use of social information in city government deci-sion-making, Szanton concluded:...The characteristics of the academic world cannot fullyexplain the frequent inability of academics to provideuseful advice to urban officials since such failure was an outcome typical not only of university-based efforts toadvise city governments, but of the work of a wide varietyof non-academic providers of advice. ... A far better ex- planation is that city governments are particularly weakand constrained users of any advice, and are sharply limit-ed in their capacity to act on recommendations forchange.45There are numerous views about how to overcome these linkageproblems. Some social scientists have discussed the pros and cons of whether social scientists should become advocatesdirectly in-volved in recommending policy and lobbying for the preferredoption that flows from their research.46 A variation on this modelis that of the \"social engineer,\" proposed by Janowitz and Lazars-feld, and discussed in Chapter X, Section D 47, or the \"social clini-can\" model, proposed by Gouldner and Rossi.\" These modelsassume that objective knowledge is used directly in policymaking.They propose basically that behavioral and social scientists shouldwork directly with decisionmakers at all phases of decisionmaking,injecting social research knowledge where relevant. Resistance to a social engineering model comes from the fact that \"a democraticsystem does not want technocratic solutions imposed on decision-makers; a pluralistic society does not want political controls on thefreedom of research. ...\" 46 \"Rich, Robert F.

Weiss, Improving the Linkage ..p. 77.224 The \"social engineer\" model appears to differ from the \"manda-rin\" or public service model described by Horowitz, in which thegovernment employs social scientists directly, but temporarily, toprovide it with information needed to suggest policy options, or tomonitor and evaluate public programs. The \"mandarin\" model alsoencompasses the case of social scientists who maintain their aca-demic employment, while at the same time serving as advisor togovernment.50 or move back and forth between academia and thepublic sector. Some recent illustrations of political scientists play-ing this role include Henry Kissinger as Secretary of State, Zbig-niew Brzezinski as National Security Advisor, and Jeane Kirkpat-rick as Ambassador to the United Nations.There also have been numerous suggestions about setting up a\"research broker\" staff, in effect a trusted aid to a policymakerwho translates social knowledge into policy advice, to disseminateresearch to the policymaker.51 The National Research Council, forinstance, recommended that to enhance utilization, \"departmentsand agencies should organize their planning and budgeting activi-ties to provide a significant role for knowledge brokers, who shouldassume increased responsibility for policy planning and programdevelopment.5 2Richard Levinson, a sociologist who served as a congressionalaide, recently wrote that effective brokering or liLkage of this sort,at least in Congress, occurs most frequently not via individual re-searchers, but via the \"input of advocacy or interest groups as theyprepare arguments in support of or in opposition to a bill.\" The im-plication is that \". ..for sociologists to have an influence on devel-oping federal social policy, our findings must accumulate on anissue and then be used to address or shape proposals for policy byorganizations with regular congressional contact.\" 531 TRANSLATION OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH FINDINGS BY THE MEDIACarol Weiss and her associates have concluded that one criticalfacto necessary to promote utilization is \"translation\" or reportingof research findings is the mass media. This reporting may influ-ence decisionmakers directly or may influence the attitudes ofthose from whom the decisionmakers seek advice. Therefore, itmay be to the advantage of behavioral and social scientists inter-ested in ensuring use to hold press conferences to describe theirfindings and to write short layman's versions of their research re-ports. Media reporting of such research tends however, to be con-fined to those stories considered \"newsworthy\" by the media. This 6\u00b0 See, for instance, the case of social scientist Graham Allison, dean of the John F.

POLICY SCIENCESThe alleged difficulties of applied social science to have a signifi-cant impact on policymaking and dissatisfaction with the con-straints of the \"enlightenment\" mode of influencing policymaking,have given momentum to the development of a relatively new field,called \"policy sciences.\" This development represents a shift from a discipline-centered approach of the production of knowledge, to aproblem-centered approach premised on the notion that applicationof knowledge in policymaking does not occur automatically.\"Training programs for policy scientists are unique and often takeplace in separate schools of policy science and analysis.57 They aredesigned to produce researchers who can understand the dynamicsof the policymaking process and are sufficiently familiar with thediscipline knowledge bases and needs and timing of policymakersto be able to integrate behavioral and social sciences directly intothe policy process.\" In fact, policy researchers have produced anEncyclopedia of Policy Studies.\" Policy researchers generally have 54 Lecture by Carol Weiss at the American Psychological Association, May 29, 1985, Singer,Eleanor and Phyllis Endreny.

They tend, instead, toseek recognition from others in this field or from policy makers.K. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS ON UTILIZATIONThere are many examples of the application of behavioral andsocial science research in clinical, research, and industrial settings.There is also evidence of the use of such sciences in policymaking.Despite this evidence of use, complaints about the lack of effec-tive utilization abound. Many dilemmas and obstacles hamper theeffective use of behavioral and social research in policymaking. Themajor obstacle is the social and political climate. Policymaking is a process that uses many inputsvalues, advocacy or interest grouppressures, and scientific informationto name but a few. Often thevalidity of behavorial and social science information is measuredagainst standards embodied in the consensus of prevailing socialand political values. Verified, or even non-verified, behavorial andsocial information will be used in policymaking if it coincides withthese values. Findings that may be contrary to the prevailing con-sensus may well have long-term value in shaping a future consen-sus with policy consequences, but social scientists and policymakersmay not at that time recognize and credit the social science contri-bution. The effectiveness of utilization also varies with the policy-making situation. Some situations demand short-range applied sci-ence answers; others require answers to fundamental questionsthat only basic science can provide. If one type of information issubstituted for another, utilization may be judged ineffective. Otherfactors which impede utilization are: behavioral and social scienceinformation may be counterintuitive, irrelevant, politically naive inthat it challenges existing bureaucratic authority, too late, overlyquantitative and jargon-laden, and inaccurate or unverified.Studies of knowledge utilization of the behavioral and social sci-ences indicate that research information in these disciplines is usedmost effectively when judged according to an enlightenment model.According to this model, no one piece of research can be pinpoint-ed, necessarily, as having influenced any one particular decisionbut behavioral and social science research, over time, provides deci-sionmakers with \". .. an intellectual backdrop of concepts, propo-sitions, orientations,\" and data.Some policymakers, aware of the approximately $2 billionannual support level for behavioral and social research and devel-opment and related activities, may consider inefficient, or a poorreturn on investment of public funds, the limited kind of utilizationimplied by the enlightment model. Indeed, some behavioral andsocial scientists have criticized their colleagues as well as policy-makers for having too many expectations for these sciences thatcannot be fulfilled. \" Nagel, Stuart S. Contemporary Public Policy Analysts. University of Alabama Press, 1984,174 p. 222On the other hand, it must be pointed out that this model, pre-mised on the notion of the cumulative dissemination and utiliza-tion of information over timeinformation which is used intandem with other kinds of information, value considerations, cost-benefit tradeoffs, and constituency pressuresin policymaking mayalso be a valid explanation of the way natural and physical sci-ences information influences policymaking. There is also the con-sideration that the cost of behavioral and social science researchprobably about $721 million in fiscal year 1986is only a smallpercentageabout 4.6 percent of the total annual expenditure forall federally funded scientific research and development in thefiscal year V'S-6, estimated. Evidence was given in this study to il-lustrate the value to society from Federal investments in manytypes of behavioral and social science research, experimentation,and development.This chapter indicated some possible ways to enhance the returnon Federal investments in the conduct of federally supported be-havioral and social science research and development. But thisprobably requires improved priority setting by both producers andusers of such knowledge. In addition, according to many experts onutilization of knowledge, who were cited in this report, some of thepractices and procedures of behavioral and social research mayhamper effective utilization. Among the recommendations made inthis chapter to improve the applic',.ion and utilization of behavior-al and social science research are the following: considering waysto expand support (from Government and the scientific community)to produce more long-term, anticipatory, research on fundamentalissues, without jeopardizing Government's need for short-term, ap-plied research; lowering expectations; confining research explicityfor Government to the evaluation of existing programs; ensuringthat adequate attention is given by both researchers and policy-makers to the issue of r llicy and program implementation; improv-ing dissemination of information about the outcome of researchwithin an agency; enhancing use of the \"research broker\" function,whether within an agency or through lobby groups; and attemptingto widen press coverage of behavioral and social research, so as toimprove communications with decisionmakers.The discipline of policy sciences is linked to both the behavioraland social sciences disciplines and the policy process. It was createdpartially on the premise that policy analysts can provide policy-makers with more relevant and timely information than can disci-plinary scientists. This kind of researcher may complement thework of those social scientists who choose to maintain an arm'slength distance from the policy process because it is an alien envi-ronment or in order ',o avoid the real or perceived threat of beingco-opted and losing their scientific objectivity and independence.Whether or not the utilization of behavioral and social sciences in-formation has been improved via the mechanism of policy researchhas not been examined. 228 XII. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICYBehavioral and social sciences research encompasses a vast mul- tifaceted enterprise of such magnitude as to defy easy generaliza- tion. It includes such sciences as anthropology, sociology, psycholo-gy, political science, economics, linguistics, psychobiology, and geog-raphy and regional science. Fiscal year 1986 Federal obligations for research in these fields are estimated to total about $722 million.No current, accurate data are available to describe obligations fordevelopment, dissemination, and related activities, but based on past trends, total Federal funding for the behavioral and social sci-ences, including fund!. g for development and dissemination, is esti-mated to total at least twice or perhaps triple that amount. Behav-ioral and social scientists constitute about 11.3 percent of the totalnumber of employed U.S. scientists and engineers. They consisted,in 1983 of 143,500 psychologists and 247,200 social scientists. About12 percent report R&D as their primary work activity.The history of Federal support for the behavioral and social sci-ences shows that the Federal Government has played a major rolein shaping these fields of science via funding and through the cre- ation of institutions to support basic and applied research, trainstudents, and regulate some research procedures. It is estimated inthis report that Federal funding for research in these disciplinessince 1967 totals about $11 billion. Federal support for these fieldsbegan in the late nineteenth century in order to satisfy utilitarianneeds to describe agricultural demand and production and to im- prove census data. Large-scale Federal support for basic researchbecame a responsibility of the National Institute of Health and theNational Science Foundation in the 1950s. These two agencies,today, provide the bulk of all basic research support for these disci-plines and the bulk of all basic university research support forsome disciplines. However, about 70 percent, on average, of all Fed-eral funds for behavioral and social research are awarded by agen- cies whose primary mission is not research support (the Depart-ments of Agriculture, Defense, Justice, Labor, and other agencies ofthe Department of Health and Human Services).Over the last forty years, the bulk of Federal support has gone to applied, not to basic behavioral and social science, and for socialsciences, as opposed to behavioral sciences (psychology). The majorsocial science discipline supported have been economics and sociolo-gy. Federal behavioral and social knowledge production and utiliza-tion activities were estimated to have cost almost $2 billion in thefiscal year 1977. The National Science Foundation does not publishinformation which describes Federal funding for development inthese fields. It collects and publishes only information about re- search activitieswhich comprise about one-third of this amount(the total).(223)4'29 224In the 1950s, Federal support began to eclipse foundation supportprograms, which had gone primarily to support basic research.Today foundation support for research in these fields is about 8percent of the level of Federal support. Foundations support pri-marily applied researchincluding controversial issues that ques-tion the status quo and challenge existing organizations and struc-turesissues that the Federal Government may chose not to sup-port.Institutions to formalize governmental use of and access to re-search applications in the fields of behavioral and social sciencehave been established over timesuch as the Council of EconomicAdvisors and the Institute for Program Evaluation in the GeneralAccounting Office. There have also been several proposals, not car-ried through to fruition, to create institutions to use behavioraland social sciences information at the presidential level in a pro-posed Council of Social Advisors.Behavioral and social research appears to have been applied andused most effectively in technical, administrative and clinical set-tings where applications are not influenced by issues of publicpolicy. Federally supported basic and applied research in thesefields is intended to be used for both technical and policy purposes.Most Federal support for behavioral and social sciences has beenfor applied research to suppbrt short-range information needs.There are many complaints that much federally funded behavioraland social researchwhether basic or appliedis not used directlyin policymaking but that it accumulates to \"enlighten decisionmak-ing.\" It may be that some expectations for using behavioral andsocial sciences research information in policymaking do not recog-nize the many obstacles to the production of such knowledge andthe complexity, values, and politics of policymaking. However, ithas been pointed out that more direct and deliberate use of suchinformation might occur if there were more support for longer-range studies of fundamental issues in social behavior. There havebeen recommendations basically for mission agencies to fund moreresearch of a fundamental nature in order to create a knowledgebase which could be used later when short-term decisionmakingneeds called for it. The current austere budgetary climate will un-doubtedly require that priorities be set for funding in these fields.Some of the following policy considerations will probably be rele-vant to funding decisions in the future.Given that there appears to be a need to improve priority-setting in order to enhance utilization and satisfy budgetaryconstraints, should Federal agencies which fund applied behav-ioral and social research establish interagency coordinationmechanisms in order to coordinate priority setting, funding ofresearch useful to more than one agency, and information dis-semination?Could such mechanisms be designed to ensure cross-fertiliza-tion between the conduct and use of longer-range anticipatorywork, and more problem-oriented research?Should Federal agencies devote more of their resources tothe support of anticipatory or more longer-range mission ori-ented fundamental research, which deals with basic questionsof human behavior and cause and effect, but which might con- 0 225tribute to policy only potentially? Should short-range appliedresearch programs be cut back?Would it be detrimental to the long-range future of behavior-al and social sciences to ask researchers in these fields to con- sider doing more \"socially relevant\" 1 basic research, with pri-orities guided not only by internal scientific criteria, but alsomore by society's knowledge needs? If it is appropriate, howwill these priorities belletermined? What role can policymak- ers play in determining priorities?Much support from the research support agencies focuses on de- velopment of databases and refinement of quantitative researchmethods, thus perpetuating the legacy of early support patterns,when criticism forced these agencies to support primarily objective,\"scientific research\". Questions remain about whether Federalagencies need to promote cross-fertilization between basic researchof this nature and applied research needs in the domains of the be-havioral and the social sciences.Should attempts be made by Federal bureaucrats to applythe contributions and understandings of basic research in theapplications of the mission agencies, rather than leaving cross- fertilization efforts to researchers themselves?Should such efforts be spearheaded by the Government'slargest supporters of behavioral and social researchthe De-fense Department, the Department of Health and HumanServices, the Agriculture Department, and the National Sci-ence Foundation?Before the establishment of Federal basic research support agen- cies, non-profit foundations provided behavioral and social re- searchers with core support to enhance methodologies and create research institutes. Foundation support now constitutes about 8 percent of the Federal level, and has been reoriented to support ap- plied work, especially in controversial subjects which the Govern-ment avoids.Have levels of foundation support been reduced es a result of various Federal regulations?Should the Government consider altering some of the tax burdens which affect the formation, funding, and functions offoundations, so as to increase foundation support?Several other factors affect utilization of researchthe most sa- lient being the political systemthat is, research information tendsto be used most directly if it supports a policymaker's prevailing viewswhether that policymaker be a Federal bureaucrat, Federalelected official, or a lobbyist. Several cases in this study demon-strated the pertinence of this practice. They dealt with the use, or lack thereof, of behavioral and social science information in suchareas as: presidential commissions, court cases such tss Brown vs.Board of Education, studies of juvenile delinquency, the Colemanstudies on school desegregation, Moynihan's work on black youth, intelligence testing, and disil:usionment with the \"Great Society\"programs. However, there are several other factors which hinderutilization. These include university reward systems which do not1Thia term is based on the writings cited above of Roy and Shapley, and Scott and Shore,passim. 226value applied work as much as basic; reports which are too late,too-long, and too-jargon laden; fraud and deception in research; pol-icymakers who cannot their research needs; and the ade-quacy of \"research brokers\" who can \"translate\" behavioral andsocial science research into the kind of information that is usefulfor decisionmaking. This latter factor is both a cognitive and aninterpersonal process.Actions have been suggested to overcome these obstacles. Somemight require Government action, but many would require re-sponses by behavioral and social scientists. The following issuesmay warrant additional attention:Has the Federal Government come to expect too much frombehavioral and social science research as an aid to policymak-ing? Should the Government lower expectations, and, in theapplied area, support primarily research related to programevaluations or outcomes, rather than asking scientists as muchto develop suggestions for new programs and policies?Do institutional review boards, set up to ensure complianceof researchers with regulations to minimize the effects of re-search on human subjects and to check fraud and abuse oper-ate as intended by statutes and policies governing their cre-ation? Does Congress need to improve oversight of institutionalreview boards?Are codes of ethics developed by the professions.' associationsbeing implemented satisfactorily?Can behavioral and social scientists enhance their utility toGovernment by overcom; ag some of the procedural, but appar-ently crucial, factors which hinder use, including:improving the intelligibility of reports, by deemphasiz-ing jargon and quantification, andproducing reports on a more timely basis.Several kinds of organizational arrangements have been used inthe past to produce policy relevant behavioral and social researchfor the Government and other kinds of arrangements have beenproposed. These include federally funded research centers, exempli-fied by the Urban Institute and the Wisconsin Institute for Re-search on Poverty. Advisory commission reports and recent con-gressional testimony have suggested variations: a Graduate Schoolof Applied Behavioral Science to do multidisciplinary research anda series of social problem oriented research units funded by the Na-tional Science Foundation and other variations. There also havebeen proposals to shift all support for basic and applied research toa National Social Science Foundation. The Congre-a may want toexplore these issues:Considering the magnitude of Federal expenditures for socialand behavioral research, the needs expressed recently to trimFederal expenditures, and also the widespread complaintsabout lack of effective use of knowledge from these disciplines,should the Federal Government explore whether it may be inthe publii- interest to create a research funding mechanism oragency exclusively to produce behavioral mid social researchfor policy purposesone that serves the potential needs of allFederal agencies? Or has the pluralistic support pattern of the232 227past served federal needs adequately and provided an adequatereturn on investments of Federal dollars?There is also a widely heicl view that the use of the behavioral and 'social sciences in policymakin is hampered by lack of atten- tion to the \"implementation\" or \"development\" phase of the re- search and development sequence. The lack of emphasis appears to prevent researchers from assessing some of the administrative ob-stacles to program design and may narrow the perspectives of re- search fanciers, who may not believe that implementation is as fin- portant as policy and program design. A related issue is that many studies have shown that utilization is enhanced by the use of \"re- search brokers\", consisting either of in-house staff or advocacy groups, to translate scientific information into terms that the pol-icymaker can understand. Considering these obstacles to use, the Congress may Wish to consider:Should policymakers and social scientists give more atten- tion to the issue of implementation in the design and evalua-tion of programs, to ensure that policy advice is carriedthrough to the crucial administrative phases of program andpolicy delivery?Should Federal agencies establish a \"research broker\" staffto improve communications between researchers and policy-makers?Industry uses the behavioral and social ..ciences in support of pri-mary work, such as the survey research industry, estimated to be a$4 billion annual business, and in secondary roles in other indus-tries, including communications, transportation, food, and hie,-technology development. There is no reliable information availaheto describe the extent of industrial support for these fields. Thisreport showed that academic employment for behavioral and socialscientists is shrinking, while industrial employment is increasing.But the vast majority of behavioral and s )vial scientists in industrydo not do research as their primary work activity. It may be that more and better data should be collected to describe industry's roleand to develop analyses of implications for research policy and per- sonnel training. There appear to be similar data gaps in the collec- tion of information about State and local government support forresearch in these fields. The Committee may want to consider thefollowing issues:Since current data are inadequate to describe industry's sup- port of behavioral and social research, it may be necessary to collect more accurate data through an agency, such as the No- tional Science Foundation or the Commerce Department.Should the National Science Foundation reestablish a pro- gram to collect data about State and local government supportfor behavioral and social sciences research?This study reported that there appears to be an oversupply of be- havioral and social scientists. Employment patterns appear to be shifting over time. The proportion of psychologists and social scien-tists employed in academia has started to decrease. In additionthere are decreasing numbers of doctoral level social scientists andpsychologists training to concentrate on research. Some of theseshifts appear to stem from to declining university enrollments forstudy of these fields. Some appear to be the result of natural,g33 228market mechanismsthat is, employment of social scientists andpsychologists has increased in industry, which may have drawn offsome manpower to new industrial job opportunities. It is not en-tirely clear whether the current behavioral and social science laborpool is training in the areas sought by industry.Another issue also appears relevant. Many manpower trainingprograms in the social and behavioral sciences have been supportedprimarily by the basic research support agencies of the FederalGovernment. Behavioral and social sciences research support pro-grams in the National Science Foundation and. the ADAMHA haveexperienced real dollar cuts in recent years. Federal policies, there-fore, may have contributed to the shifts in the character of the re-search personnel pool. Some say that the critical mass of scholarsneeded to do valuable research has eroded seriously.The Congress may wish to examine further manpowersupply ,and demand patterns in the behavioral and social sci-ences and, if projected shortfalls in supply are discovered inparticular areas, it may seek to determine the precise effects ofretrenchment in, Federal support programs that directly andindirectly support production of scientific personnel in the be-havioral and social sciences. In addition it may want to consid-er fuither the composition of the skills of the labor pool nowconsidered excessive.In addition, as demand shifts from academia to industry, acase can be made for industry's responsibility to pick up somesupport functions. Government/industry cooperative programsmay be appropriate. In addition, it may be relevant for theCongress to examine whether industrial programs in thisregard would profit from inducements and incentives, such asthose which might be afforded by including the behavioral andsocial sciences among.the research fields eligible for industrialtax crecns in the Economic Recovery Tax Act, P.L. 97-344,that is up for renewal in 1986.In addition, the Congress may want to examine the effectson research production capabilities in universities that mightresult from the decrease in academic employment for behavior-al and social scientists. In comparison with the decade of the1970s, only about one-half the amount of federally funded basicsocial science research is being conducted in universities in the1980s. Is the focus of research shifting? Is this an appropriatedevelopment? Or will it weaken the scientific foundations ofthese disciplines?Another major data gap appears to warrant attention. The onlycomplete survey to describe the full range of Federal responsibil-ities and obligations for the behavioral and social sciences was areport published in 1978 by the National Research Council of theNational Academy of Sciences. As noted above, it concluded thatFederal expenditures for behavioral and social research and devel-opment and related activities totaled almost $2 billion for 1977.Currently the National Science Foundation report funding dataonly for the research component, which constitutes about one-thirdof this total.Considering the lack of current information to describe Fed-eral obligations for all behavioral and social research and de- 234 229velopment, the Congress may wish to request some governmen- tal agency to collect information to describe and inventory de-velopment and dissemination responsibilities and fundinglevels. They appear to be double or triple obligational levels forresearch, but without sound data, no firm estimates, nor policy issues can be suggested.NSF data show that Federal support for basic and applied behav-ioral and social science research increased as a percentage of total Federal research funding, from about 3.9 percent in 1962 to a high of 8 percent in 1971, and then started to decrease steadily, to about4.8 percent estimated in 1985. There was an accelerated decrease ofabout 1 percentage point beginning in 1982, reflecting the cuts in-stituted by the Reagan Administration. These, reportedly, were made on the grounds of political philosophy and fiscal responsibil-ity. Social sciences funding bore the brunt of the cuts, while prior-ities in psychology were shifted. Dissatisfaction with the characterof research output and with research utilization may have contrib- uted to these cuts. Some believe that these cuts and shifts eliminat-ed funding for marginal projects and, as a result, were wholly war- ranted solely for such reasons. In terms of current dollars, fiscalyear 1980 funding levels were not restored until fiscal year 1985.But the cuts, expressed in terms of constant dollars, have not yetbeen restored. The constant dollar obligation level for the period1982 to 1985 is about $328 million, about 19 percent lower than theaverage Federal oblioation level for these sciences in terms of realdollars for the period 1970 to 1980.Considering the recent cuts in funding for these fields or the shifting of priorities, as well as calls for more cutbacks in Fed- eral funding to balance the budget, the Committee may want to examine the effects of retrenchment on: manpower develop-ment, scientific progress, research capability, types of researchsupported, and other aspects of scientific capability in the "}
