Fears from parents about side effects and adverse reactions have steered many away from wanting to vaccinate their children despite the numerous infectious diseases they prevent. These debates have gotten in the way of progression in schools for preventing the spread of disease. To me, the risks of not vaccinating children are far greater than the risks of adverse reactions. Parents who don't vaccinate their children put them and others at risk because it allows normally preventable disease to continue to spread. As a school community, we promote heritage and culture in our school through assemblies and educational presentations to preserve our culture. A huge celebration that takes place is National day where the triad of parent, school and community come together to celebrate our country. Nutritious food is of paramount importance for a healthy mind and body. Childhood is a time of critical growth in which proper nutrition is absolutely necessary. Children who have poor diets either due of a lack of food or because of bad eating habits and patterns, leads to inadequate intake of nutrients and are prone to significant short-term and long-term health impacts and diseases. The seven core values of the NAEYC Code of Ethical Conduct are different kind of commitments that we have to follow in order to be in a field of any early childhood care and education. The seven values are: Appreciate childhood as a unique and valuable stage of the human life cycle., Base our work on knowledge of how children develop and learn., Appreciate and support the bond between the child and family, recognize that children are best understood and supported in the context of family, culture, community and society., Respect the dignity, work and uniqueness of each individual., Respect diversity in children, families ,and colleagues., And finally, Recognize that children and adults achieve their full potential in the context of relationships that are based on trust and respect. 7 / D.P7: Explain how different procedures maintain health and safety in a selected health or social care setting It was the middle of summer when it happened. I was about 9 years old and my mom and dad had just called me into my mom's room. I had had a medical procedure about a couple of weeks before hand so I wasn't surprised when they said it was about the results. You are going to the cafeteria to buy lunch. You are starving and pick up a tray to get food. The first thing you see are chicken nuggets, then you remember you can't eat chicken nuggets because you are allergic to gluten. So you get some mashed potatoes and fruit instead. You want to get dessert but the brownies have peanuts in them and you're allergic to peanuts too. When you want a drink, the only drink available is milk, but you are lactose intolerant. You go to pay, with only a little bit of mashed potatoes and fruit on your tray. Schools do not have enough lunch options for kids with allergies. 1 in 13 kids is affected from a food allergy and 40% of these kids have life threatening reactions. This is why I believe schools should make Partnership working means that, all agencies and professionals work together to safeguard children. Each professional or agency will have a different role to play but each of them is all as important. Physical- One way physical needs were met was through the access of water which created a plentiful source of low cost refreshment throughout the day. All children had a water bottle which was kept in the classroom. Children were given ready access to water throughout the day. Water provision: encouraged good health and wellbeing among the children, reduced tiredness, irritability and distraction from thirst, had a positive effect on children's concentration throughout the day and raised awareness of the importance of adequate fluid intake and healthy eating as part of a healthy and active life. In every school there are set policies and procedures so that all people working within the school are aware and stick to the same rules. Consistency is imperative. All adults working in the school would be : teaching staff, support staff, lunchtime supervisors, kitchen staff, governors, after school staff and temporary staff. There are many policies in schools that children and staff should be aware of. For example : Behaviour policy, bullying, attendance, code of conduct, sanctions & rewards and health and safety. This is very important for safety as if any of these factors are off the child in need could end up with a medical emergency. The nurse also keeps a folder for each child regarding medications and orders from physicians. This is to ensure that the correct information is on hand when needed. The nurse ensures that all medications are out of reach of children at all times, that there are written procedures on administration and handling of medications, and documentation of medication administration. The documentation must include the child's condition after the medication is given and their behavior. This is used for quality improvement purposes, as if the child's condition is not improved after administration of the medication a provider needs to be contacted to reassess the child and medication dosage. Another safety initiative that must be implemented per federal guidelines is having emergency protocols and local emergency contacts listed. They must be posted in an area accessible and known to staff. Upon admission into the Head Start program the nurse must assess each student ensure that they have continuous accessible healthcare. If they do not, it is the These Act inform practices that all staff the responsibility to keep themselves and other around them safe through their actions at work and they must to report any health and safety problems. Also, all staff must to follow policies and procedure when hand handing equipment and they should to work in way that puts other around them in danger. Duty of care is when we must follow the correct policies and procedures in order to protect and safeguard children from any harm. This means that we have a respnsibility to do daily health and safety checks on all equipment that children are likely to use encase any of it is broken, we must carry our risk assessments in order to make sure that all work areas and play areas are safe for children to use and also most importantly we must carry out fire drills so that children are familiar with the sound of the fire alarm, aware on where they have to go in order to reach safety and what they have to do. Throughout this essay I will be explaining how a behaviour policy supports teachers and how it can also create an effective learning environment. I will also be highlighting any issues which could potentially arise from the use of a behaviour policy. A behaviour policy is guidance for members of staff within a school on how to deal with different behaviours, and sets out the expectations of behaviour for all children at the school. If a behaviour policy is written well it will support the formation of an effective learning environment. An effective learning environment for young children is an environment in which all children feel able to express themselves freely, allowing them to learn effectively. School and teachers can influence the extent and quality of learning for all students. Teacher's beliefs, practices and attitudes are important for understanding and improving educational processes. They are closely linked to teachers' strategies for coping with challenges in their daily professional life. Educators have control over numerous factors that influence motivation, achievement and behaviour of students. They are turning around their approach into a focus on creating positive school climate and responsive classroom as part of holistic quality education based on child rights where there is effective teaching and classroom management, thus enhancing students' learning experiences.
