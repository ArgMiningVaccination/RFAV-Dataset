It aims to heal naturally in a rapid gentle and permanent manner, aiming to eradicate the disease rather than palliating or suppressing it. The theory is not new it has been around for over three thousand years and was even talked about by Hippocrates in ancient Greece but it was a German physician Samuel Hahnemann who rediscovered Homeopathy around 200 years ago that brings it to us today. He was a doctor who became unhappy with the treatments available at the time (blood letting, leaches, poisons etc). The basis of homeopathy is to match as closely as possible the symptoms of the patient to the remedy of choice picture. Using the principle that \"like cures like.\" Hahnemann conducted a huge amount of research / work at that time that has been continued by many other great physicians since. It is Hahnemanns eternal legacy that Homeopathy continues to thrive and grow against a backdrop of a multi million pound drug industry. "}
