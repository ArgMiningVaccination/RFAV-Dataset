Fortunately, some of the best remedies for helping to ward off respiratory viruses are already in your kitchen, in the form of immune-boosting foods and anti-inflammatory herbs and spices. Our favorites are those that act on the respiratory tract as well as the immune system and come with the bonus of being easy to work into everyday meals. 7 favorite immune-boosting foods Green Tea. Exciting new research about green tea's anti-viral effects could not have come at a better time. In [one recent preliminary study](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.30.360545v1), a German research team analyzed the potential of plant-derived foods to inactivate influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. Green tea demonstrated \"viricidal\" (virus destroying) activity against both viruses, suggesting that drinking green tea may help reduce viral loads. Researchers noted that pomegranate and black chokecherry juice had similar anti-viral effects. In a [second study](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2020.601316/full), researchers from North Carolina State University found that plant flavonoids in green tea could potentially slow the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by blocking a specific viral enzyme, helping to inhibit the virus's growth. Flavonoid-rich dark chocolate and muscadine grapes have high levels of these same flavonoids. Green tea is also a source for epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a polyphenol that has been found to have antiviral effects against influenza A virus (seasonal flu). Plus, green tea helps to support the immune system when viruses and other microbes do manage to slip through. One tea ingredient, L-theanine, appears to prime the memory of core T cells in the immune system, teaching them to recognize certain molecular subcomponents of invading microbes so they can mount a significantly stronger response than \"na\u00efve\" T cells. Another group of compounds in tea called catechins are under evaluation for their antimicrobial effects. For a twist on green tea, try our recipe for [Matcha Green Tea Latte](/other-womens-health/matcha-green-tea-supercharge-your-mornings/) that uses shade grown matcha, a form of green tea that is especially rich in flavonoids and polyphenols. Probiotic-rich foods. Did you know that approximately 75% of your immune system resides in your gastrointestinal tract? It is found among your gut bacteria, so you want to make a special effort to feed good bacteria to your GI tract and help this connection flourish. Some of our favorite [probiotic-rich foods](/nutrition/how-to-get-more-probiotics-every-day/) include sauerkraut and kimchi as a side dish or topping at meals, yogurt as an easy breakfast or snack and lacto-fermented pickles as a snack or stacked in a sandwich. Because friendly gut flora is so important for immune health, I am also telling my patients to keep taking their probiotic supplement to ensure that good bacteria is constantly replenished. A high quality probiotic like [Super Biotic](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/super-biotic-probiotic) is a great way to get what you need. Berries. Blueberries, raspberries, blackberries and strawberries are bursting with compounds that support your [immune health](/other-womens-health/best-vitamins-immune-support/). This is because berries contain flavonoids, a type of [antioxidant](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/super-c-plus) that can help reduce damage to cells and protect immune response at the cellular level. Other compounds in berries that boost immune response include antioxidant Vitamin C and Vitamin A, dietary fiber, and manganese. If you live in an area where berries are out of season in winter (as is the case in most of the US), buy frozen berries rather than fresh berries shipped long distance. Frozen berries are flash frozen at peak ripeness and have lost little nutritional content. Fresh berries shipped thousands of miles to your grocery store were likely sprayed with a preservative and are not at peak nutritional content. For an alternative to berries, try figs, which have similar beneficial properties. Figs work well in many savory and sweet wintertime recipes. Hot peppers. Chili peppers such as jalape\u00f1o, poblano, or serrano contain moderate levels of the compound capsaicin, which is what makes peppers burn in your mouth \u2014 and clear out your sinuses! Adding these peppers to soups and other dishes can help open up clogged airways and promote better drainage of the sinuses, which in turn helps rid them of infectious bacteria, viruses, and the mucus and cellular debris associated with them. Peppers are also a high-quality source of Vitamin C. As with some other natural treatments, the research on Vitamin C and cold and flu prevention has been mixed and somewhat controversial. That said, Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is a powerful antioxidant, and it does appear to benefit the immune response, reduce the duration of respiratory symptoms, and may have some direct effects against influenza. Garlic. Studies have shown that garlic promotes overall immune health, that it is active against specific bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. It may also boost the ability of the respiratory tract to defend against viral infection. Chicken soup. Mothers and grandmothers have prescribed homemade chicken soup as a remedy for colds and flu for generations \u2014 and with good reason! It may not be a cure-all, but chicken soup does have a number of benefits for overall immune health and a healthy respiratory tract, and it certainly is comforting. As part of the natural inflammatory response, respiratory viruses like the common cold and influenza cause immune cells called neutrophils to migrate to the mucosal lining of the airways. This is thought to be what causes the secretion of mucus. Chicken soup has been shown to significantly limit the number of neutrophils that get drawn in. Steam from chicken soup helps open nasal passages, so it also helps remove infectious particles from your airways in that fashion. (And if you make a chicken soup with fresh, homemade broth, garlic and a jalape\u00f1o pepper, you'll have a triple whammy for your respiratory health!) Herbal tisanes. When steeped in boiling water, just about any herb or plant material that is not tea leaves becomes what is known traditionally as a tisane. If left to brew for some time, it becomes an infusion. Whether brewed as single ingredients or in combination, there are countless varieties of these herbal tisanes and infusions, with an equally diverse range of health-enhancing applications. One of the best known and most widely used herbs, Echinacea, has been long considered a source of immune support in traditional medicine. Laboratory studies on different Echinacea species, plant parts and preparations have demonstrated a variety of antiviral properties, useful in preventing and fending off respiratory viruses. Studies also demonstrate that Echinacea preparations can differ greatly, as can their effectiveness. We recommend you look for organically grown or sustainably harvested herbs, and if using supplements, choose high-quality standardized extracts. 5 medicinal herbs for cold and flu season You don't have to brew up a tisane to build better immunity with herbs. Herbs can be compounded in a wide range of forms, including tinctures, extracts, homeopathic and combination preparations. Most botanical preparations containing these herbs work best when taken as preventives, or as soon as your first symptoms appear. Here are 5 for which the science is strong. 1) Astragalus (A. membranaceous)* 2) Black elderberry 5) Eleuthero (Siberian ginseng \u2014 Eleutherococcus senticosus)* * Herbs included in Women's Health Network's [ Adaptisol](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/adaptisol) formulation. Herbal medicines are thought to neutralize or limit the success of seasonal viruses in many ways, including increasing immune cell numbers and function, gene expression, and cell-signaling activity in the body. Others appear to act upon the virus particles themselves. Having these remedies to turn to during cold and flu season will help give you the boost you need in addition to a [ quality probiotic and antioxidant blend!](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/collections/immune-support/products/immune-support-combo) 1 Rowe, C., et al. 2007.
