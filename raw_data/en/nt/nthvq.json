More concerning, not nearly enough of the compounds in vaccines have been thoroughly, objectively tested to determine their long-term safety, or any immediate and/or subsequently delayed health complications. Here's an overview on some of the various chemical ingredients found in vaccines routinely given to infants, children and teenagers. The list is not complete. Formaldehyde Shown in numerous studies to possess strong carcinogenic properties, as well as the potential for fetal damage during pregnancy. Polysorbate-80 A commonly used and potent chemical emulsifier that has been frequently linked to increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and infertility. Ethanol Exposure to ethanol has been frequently linked to headaches, nausea, vomiting, loss of energy and other undesirable conditions. Acetone A harsh industrial chemical used commonly found in paint thinner and nail polish removers, as well as in many manufacturing applications and packaging materials. Thimerosal This known neurotoxin, which is frequently referred to as Ethyl-mercury, is among the most toxic substances on the planet, comprised of nearly 50% pure mercury content. Benzethonium chloride Research has shown that this extremely dangerous chemical may result in fetal mutations, in addition to being a known carcinogen. Glutaraldehyde Used commonly in commercial settings for disinfection and preservative purposes, Glutaraldehyde has been shown to compromise respiratory function. Aluminum Phosphate, Sulfate These corrosive acid compounds are known carcinogens, and contain chemicals that include aluminum salt, aluminum phosphate, sulfuric acid and other neurotoxins. Human serum albumin The body can't utilize this protein when it's been injected, which has led many researchers to site it as a cause for certain disorders of the immune system. Animal DNA Advanced testing has clearly identified the presence of both cow and monkey DNA in common vaccines, both of which may transmit bacterial and viral components. Phenol-carbolic acid Phenol-carbolic acid is so potentially bad, that even the Centers for Disease Control has it categorized as a hazardous material. Contact can cause everything from dizziness and upset stomach to death.
