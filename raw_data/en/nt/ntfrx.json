For centuries we have lived in a symbiotic relationship with nature, learning to adapt to the diverse conditions of our biomes. Living close to the forest, being nature, we observe the plants and listen to their wisdom, we understand their physical presentations, similarities and kinship, their unique chemical compositions, and the relationship of these properties with each region of the human body based on their energetic constitutions and formats. In the course of history, indigenous peoples, rural peoples, the elders, in our traditional territories or in cities still have knowledge about plants and often take care of their health using natural remedies. This culture is passed down from generation to generation, always with an eye on the nature that surrounds us. The course, \"Indigenous Phytotherapy - The Plants That Heal\" is a storytelling about the medicinal plants of the Atlantic Forest, the Amazon, and world-traveling plants, through the relationship of the original peoples with the forest, with nature. In this course, we will also learn and prepare different types of remedies with these medicinal plants, each with a different objective. In addition to medicine making, we will talk about traditional healing practices that provide self-care, healing for our bodies and spirits and also for our communities and our forests. About From the Center of Mother Earth (Do Centro da M\u00e3e Terra) From the Center of Mother Earth brings the vision to strengthen our traditional culture and the wisdom of medicinal plants and ancestral healing practices, with a focus on the peoples of the Southern Atlantic Forest.
