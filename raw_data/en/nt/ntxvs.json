The disease either kills the person or affords immunity rendering them unsuitable for the virus to linger in or to return to. For the parasite, this presents a problem. Variolaconsumes its human hosts as a fire consumes its fuel, leaving spent bodies, dead or immune, behind it. Possessing no carriers or victims other than humans, the virus needs to find new hosts quickly. It thrived in places crowded with people and benefited from diseased (but not yet symptomatic) travelers visiting new and unaffected communities. Variola seemed deadliest where social chaos prevailed, wars, slavery, oppression, etc. Bad enough in the best of circumstances, smallpox fatality soared when people lacked nurturing care. During the 17th and 18th centuries, smallpox was the most serious infectious disease in the West and accounted for a substantial proportion of deaths, especially among town dwellers. The mortality rate varied regionally with 10% in Europe and 90% in America. Infected travelers would bring the disease to communities where its transmission would decimate the local population. For example, the Spanish attempted to settle Hispaniola (modern Haiti and the Dominican Republic) for sugar cane plantations in 1509. By 1518, every single one of the estimated 2.5 million island natives had perished, and the labor population had to be restored with African slaves.19 The torment of smallpox was brought to North America during early American history. Native American Indians died in especially large numbers because almost everyone in a village became sick at the same time, leaving too few to provide food, water, firewood, and care to the afflicted. Malnourished, dehydrated, cold, and demoralized, they rarely survived the virus. A colonist described the Indians' pustules as \"reeking and mattering and running one into another. And then, being very sore, what with cold and other distempers, they all died like rotten sheep.\" 19 Vaccination and Treatment It was in China in the 10th century that an early form of vaccination called \"variolation\" was first used to combat smallpox. Healers would take samples from the lesions caused by the smallpox, grind them into powder, and put some under the skin or inhale them through the nose. During the early eighteenth century, the British and their colonists also began to practice variolation: inhalation of the dried crusts from smallpox lesions like snuff, or in later modifications, inoculation of the pus from a lesion into a scratch on the forearm of a child. The intentional implantation of live smallpox matter into an incision made in an arm or a hand would produce immunity without producing the ravaging disease. For reasons that are still unclear, smallpox artificially taken through a cut proved less debilitating and less deadly than when contracted randomly and naturally through inhalation. Fewer than 5% of the variolated died, compared to the 25% ordinarily killed by natural exposure.19 Through the process of variolation or vaccination, the vaccine either \"took\" or \"did not take.\" The vaccination \"took\" if the vaccine could stimulate the initial immune response with the production of a fever and an eruption. As a result, the person generated life-long immunity. For those that \"did not take,\" the disease would be driven deeper into the body and develop a state called vaccinosis (see Chapter 6 for more on the history of vaccinosis). Edward Jenner, who was variolated at the age of eight, developed a vaccine from cowpox in 1876. It proved effective against smallpox in a percentage of cases. Since prophylaxis could be provided in the absence of the disease for the majority of patients, widespread vaccination became possible.30 Jenner developed a method of \"ring vaccination.\" Ring vaccination involves finding people who were exposed to an infected person. Then the exposed person and those people he or she had been in contact with were given the vaccine. This approach created a \"ring\" of vaccinated people around the people who were infected with smallpox and stopped the spread of the disease. Despite the fact that a small percentage of people died from this method, it was this strategy of ring vaccination that completely got rid of the disease.30 The last reported case of smallpox in the United States was in 1949. The last naturally occurring case in the world was in Somalia in 1977. After the expression of the disease was eliminated from the world, routine vaccination against smallpox was discontinued because it was no longer necessary for prevention.18 There is some debate as to whether the disease was eradicated by the vaccination program or if it was in a natural decline.30 Except for laboratory stockpiles, the variola virus has been eliminated. However, in the aftermath of the events of September and October 2001 (9/11), there is heightened concern that the variola virus might be used as an agent of bioterrorism.18 Patients with smallpox can benefit from supportive therapy (i.e., intravenous fluids, medicine to control fever, or pain) and antibiotics for any secondary bacterial infections that may occur. There is no specific treatment for smallpox, and the only conventional prevention is vaccination. Homeopathic Treatment and Prevention One might ask why include a chapter on smallpox in this book if, in fact, the disease has been eliminated. It is true that the eruptive acute expression of smallpox has been eradicated but Hahnemann and his contemporaries began to notice that individuals who had received vaccination but \"did not take\" developed a chronic state of disease. Failure to develop the characteristic scar at the sight of the vaccination meant that the vaccination \"did not take.\" In these individuals, symptoms like partial paralysis, neuralgias, cephalalgias, pimples, and pitting acne would develop. Other cases of asthma, epilepsy, nephritis, headaches, rheumatism, retardation, and tissue growths began appearing with the onset of symptoms dating back to vaccination. Despite the eradication of the eruptive expression of this disease, millions of people suffer from its vaccinosis. Specific homeopathic remedies are effective for prevention and treatment of smallpox as well as for the treatment of the vaccine-induced vaccinosis. Moreover, in the event of terrorist activity, smallpox may become prevalent once again. If this situation were to arise, there would be the need for an opportunity to use homeopathy in this area of public health. The fact that for a period of 20 years, during the mid-1900's, nearly everyone on the planet was vaccinated with smallpox means that the disease germ was introduced into a whole generation of people. What this global campaign has done to the health of the average person is unknown and beyond our ability to accurately determine as individual responses vary. What we see in clinical practice now are miasmatically mixed, complex forms of chronic disease. The tendency for miasms to mix started with the vaccinosis of smallpox. Understanding this relationship is fundamental in treating chronic disease. Correspondingly, to treat chronic disease we must be able to recognize the clinical appearance of the miasmatic condition that is related to the suppression of smallpox. Boenninghausen was the first to deduce the link between smallpox, smallpox vaccination, and sycosis (see Chapter 4).29 Based on his extensive and successful use of Thuja, a known anti-sycotic remedy,in treating patients affected with smallpox or the after-effects of smallpox vaccination he recognized this relationship. While smallpox is considered an acute miasmatic disease, susceptibility to it is based upon a previous taint with sycosis. Correspondingly, other anti-sycotic remedies may be indicated for the treatment of smallpox. Thuja 30C, 200C, and 1M given in successive doses over 24 hours before and/or after exposure to the smallpox virus, and then repeated seven days later, will "}
