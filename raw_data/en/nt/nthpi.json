You've become used [to taking daily multivitamins](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/g27269358/best-multivitamins-for-women/), loading up on [vitamin C when you're feeling sick](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a26040273/immune-boosting-foods/), and may have even reached for adaptogenic herbs at some point \u2014 why wouldn't you do the same for your pet, right? After all, all pet owners want their fur babies to be as healthy as possible, to live a long, full, adventurous life at your side. But most dog owners only need to worry about additional supplements when a certain health risk makes itself known, explains [Lindsey Bullen, DVM, ACVN](https://bluepearlvet.com/bluepearl-veterinarian-profiles/dr-bullen-veterinary-nutritionist-in-north-carolina/), a board-certified veterinary nutritionist at [BluePearl Pet Hospitals](https://bluepearlvet.com/). \"If a pet is otherwise healthy and on a complete and balanced diet, they likely do not need any supplements because their diet would have everything that they need to survive and thrive,\" she tells Good Housekeeping. Most commercially available dog foods contain the nutritional balance that pets need, and owners are likely researching any holistic benefits of their dog's food, too. The need for extra vitamins and other supplements becomes clear as puppies transition into full-bred adults and, later, as they develop health issues as they age. One of the most common reasons for supplements is joint pain, says [Jerry Klein, DVM,](https://www.akc.org/author/jerry-klein/) chief veterinary officer for the [American Kennel Club](https://www.akc.org/) (AKC). Coat issues, gastrointestinal problems, weight loss, inflammation and cognitive disorders are other reasons pets take supplements. But Klein and Bullen have a warning for pet parents: Never give supplements to your dog without talking to your pet's veterinarian first. \"Each dog's needs vary greatly, and excessive amounts of some vitamins can be harmful to your dog,\" Klein explains. For example, he says too much calcium could cause skeletal problems in some large breed puppies, and excessive vitamin A may lead to further dehydration, joint pain, and blood vessel damage. Some supplements may contain herbs and other ingredients that might interact with medications, and side effects are something that only your vet would know about in advance. You should always confirm proper dosing guidelines for any product with your pet's veterinarian. Human supplements shouldn't be given to dogs, as they can contain ingredients that could be harmful to your pets. There's another reason why it's best to discuss long-term use first: Supplements for dogs (and people, too) aren't regulated by the [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/food/buy-store-serve-safe-food/what-you-need-know-about-dietary-supplements#:~:text=Dietary%20Supplements%20can%20be%20beneficial,effectiveness%20before%20they%20are%20marketed.). And, few studies have tested the long-term safety of vitamins and other supplements for dogs. So, it's essential to try only supplements recommended by your vet and that have a quality seal by the [National Animal Supplement Council](https://www.nasc.cc/), Klein says. Other things you should look for in a dog supplement: - Brands that specialize in a certain area or have commissioned clinical studies of their products. - Products listing a lot number, which signals the company emphasizes quality control. - Products with contact details, so you can call to ask how the product was formulated and how long the manufacturer has been in business. - Know what ingredients you're looking for and check the labels to make sure the product actually contains them. Giving supplements to your dog could improve their health and quality of life. But it's always best to talk to your vet first. They'll help you decide what's safe for your fur baby, and what your pet truly needs, how much they should take and for how long. Do vets recommend CBD oils or products for dogs? It's gotten [plenty of buzz in the wellness space](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a27197249/what-is-cbd-oil/) over the past few years, so it's not too surprising that several CBD products for dogs have popped up. [CBD](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/cannabidiol-cbd-what-we-know-and-what-we-dont-2018082414476), or cannabidiol, is a natural ingredient found in cannabis that's touted for health benefits like pain and stress relief. For dogs, some in the pet industry believe CBD could help [control seizures](https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/know-canine-cbd-2020/), relieve joint pain and inflammation, and have a calming effect. But little research has been done on CBD and its full effect on dogs, explains Bullen, and any product containing THC as a byproduct, the substance that makes you feel high, could be toxic for your pet. \"Given the lack of scientific information supporting the safety of CBD in food, the FDA is also indicating that it cannot conclude that CBD is generally recognized as safe to use in human or animal food,\" writes the agency [in a warning to pet owners](https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2020-02-01/fda-warns-companies-illegally-selling-cbd-products). Regardless if it's a CBD-specific supplement or a general product on the market, be wary of any supplements with unverified claims that sound too good to be true; i.e. they'll cure cancer or other ailments, Bullen says. \"I feel that the majority of supplements are likely manufactured and developed with only the best intentions,\" she adds. \"But, the challenge with supplements is that they are not well-regulated. And, if you're choosing to supplement, it's really important to talk to your veterinarian to make sure it's actually safe.\" If you've already identified a common health issue for your pooch with your vet's help, you may be wondering which supplements to try first.
