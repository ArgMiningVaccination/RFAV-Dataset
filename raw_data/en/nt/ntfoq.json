Massage is essentially hand manipulation that promotes certain health responses in the body. [Massage therapy](http://chwbonline.com/medical-services/best-massage-therapy/) is a professional treatment by an educated individual (massage therapist). They provide treatment for multiple different health conditions by using their hands. These hand treatments include stroking, kneading, deep pressure, soft and restorative, among others. These different treatments each offer a unique benefit to the body and are best when used in combination with each other. These massage therapists also use elbows and knuckles to provide a deeper massage. This is called deep tissue or sports massage Nowadays, massage therapy doesn't stop at only using the hands. There are now multiple different tools massage therapists use for treatments. This includes bamboo sticks, cupping, hot stones, rollers, heat pads, massaging balls, and more. What Is the Training Required for Massage Therapists? Reading this, you may be considering having a massage with a registered massage therapist. If so, you are probably wondering how much education they have to become qualified for their profession. San Diego has one of the highest quality requirements for massage therapists in the country. The organization requires over 500 hours of training needed, with a recognized certificate. This includes either the NCBTMB, NCCAOM, or FSMTB National Certification. That being said, massage therapists do not just take a program and continue to massage without any further education. Since the field of massage therapy is ever-evolving, massage therapists must participate in continuing education every year. These continuing education credits are mandatory for them to keep their certificate. What Are the Benefits of Massage Therapy?

This includes: - Pre and post-natal - Children - The elderly population - Cancer patients - Those with neurological conditions - Diabetes, and much more. For many, massage therapy is part of their integrative healing plan.

This is because massage therapy is not a one-size-fits-all treatment. There are many different types of massage therapy available, thanks to science and the ever-evolving industry. Even without health conditions or pain, some people enjoy massages simply for the connection aspect of it. Touch is an essential part of our well-being, and [many studies](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/hide-and-seek/201706/touch-hunger) have discovered that physical touch can lift the mood. Touch also reduces stress, improves self-esteem, and clears the mind. This is because when we are touched, our bodies release the feel-good \"love\" hormone called oxytocin. Oxytocin is needed for our overall well-being, and the lack of oxytocin can lead to symptoms of depression, anxiety, and tension. Different Types of Massage Therapy You now know what massage therapy is, the benefits, and the education required. Now we will cover what types of massage therapy are available for you. Swedish Massage Swedish massage is the most common type of massage given. It is applied by using massage oil, and a specific stroke technique that is unique only to this style. The therapist will begin with wider strokes to loosing up the tension within the muscles. Then they will use techniques such as kneading, rolling, or wringing. After that, they will use tapotement, which is a form of tapping, to awaken the muscles. Swedish massage helps to remove tension from the body, enhance energy, and promote relaxation. Deep Tissue Massage Deep tissue massage involves a much deeper focus from the practitioner, as they need to discover specific pain points in the body. This style uses an integrative approach and looks at your body as an entire system. This is because your neck pain may not actually be from a neck injury, rather it could be from an imbalance in the hip. Deep tissue massage uses techniques that may feel a bit more intense than the Swedish style because the therapist will focus on your trouble areas and knots in your muscles. This style is especially beneficial for those who suffer from sports injuries, chronic pain, postural issues, and similar conditions. Sports Massage Sports massage is specifically for treating and preventing sports injuries, improving athletic performance, and increasing flexibility. The practitioner will use specific techniques that manipulate your soft tissue, myofascial, and muscles to both alleviate the pain and improve your range of motion. This includes joint mobilization, compression, deep tissue, and point therapy. Book Your Massage Therapy Appointment Today!
