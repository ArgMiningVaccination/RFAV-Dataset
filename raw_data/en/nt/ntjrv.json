The U.S. Supreme court recognizes they are \"unavoidably unsafe.\" [BRUESEWITZ v. WYETH LLC] So, how do we have it both ways? It's a knotty problem with mainstream medicine pushing vaccines as though they were the Holy Grail and a small, determined group of mostly parents, defiantly pushing back, saying, no to vaccines or, at the least, urging that they be made certifiably safe. For a most interesting video on the subject, view [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1m3TjokVU4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1m3TjokVU4) What follows is a brief, very brief, not very serious, reaction to a vaccine put right by homeopathic treatment. A small boy, born February, 2012, received the Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent against the measles, the mumps and German measles. Within a day his behavior changed quite markedly and, in the words of his mother, \"My son began to scream. They were high-pitched. They came on suddenly, for no apparent reason. Also, he started crying a lot, again for no apparent reason. Nothing my husband or I could do could calm him. He also started banging on things. When I told him, 'No,' he reacted with anger. His ability to learn slowed down. Before the shot, his bowel movements were regular, every day. After, they became irregular, once in two days or three or four in one day.\" The parents brought him to me approximately one month after the shot when his behavior changed so markedly. He was nearly 20 months old. He was given homeopathic Cuprum sulfuricum in a low potency daily. Four weeks later, the family returned. \"We noticed changes within one or two days,\" said the mother. \"He was back to normal. The screaming stopped within two days. So did the crying.\" The homeopathic medicine was stopped. He remained well. This is an almost trivial case of vaccine injury, though I hesitate to use the word, \"injury,\" as it was more of an unpleasant behavior change. I report the case in order to suggest that homeopathic medicine may be able to restore order in children who have been adversely altered by a vaccine. "}
