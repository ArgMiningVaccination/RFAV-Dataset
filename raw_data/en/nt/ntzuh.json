When can I get the vaccine? - The vaccine is not yet available to the general public. When the health department receives vaccine, it will be distributed to those identified as Group 1a, which includes dentists, dental hygienists /assistants , behavioral health practitioners, chiropractors, home health services/hospice, independent therapists (physical, speech, occupational) , school nurses/nurse aides, and transportation services. More information will become available as we have it. Where do I go to get the vaccine? - Your primary healthcare provider and local health department will not offer vaccination for COVID -19 at this time . The COVID -19 vaccine will be available t o patients in a phased approach shown below. The timeframe for vaccination distribution is based on vaccine availability. Members of the general public will be notified when vaccine becomes available. Will the COVID -19 vaccine be free? - Yes, the COVID -19 vaccine will be free. However, vaccine administration charges will be billed to insurance with no out -of-pocket costs incurred by patients What is the vaccine? - There are two mRNA vaccines approved for Emergency Use Au thorization - Moderna and Pfizer/ BioNTech . mRNA vaccines are a new type of vaccine to protect against infectious diseases. To trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened or inactivated germ into our bodies. Not mRNA vaccines. Instead, they teach our cells how to make a protein \u2014or Page 2 of 4 Updated: 12/23/20 Information is subject to change even just a piece of a protein \u2014that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies. At this time, it is unclear what vaccine will be m ade available to the general public. How do I know the COVID -19 vaccine is safe? - All vaccines require extensive research, documentation and closely monitored clinical trials to determine effectiveness and safety before being submitted by pharmaceutical companies for approval. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for ensuring the safety, effectiveness and availability of vaccines in the United States. The FDA requires extensive testing by manufacturers before making vaccines available to the public to protect safety and identify any potential side effects. What are the risks of the vaccine? - The FDA's rigorous testing helps ensure that vaccines are safe and highly effective. However, all medications, including vaccines, carry a small risk of side effects. Most common side effects are identified in clinical trials before the vaccine is approved, but less -common side effects may not be detected until the medicines or vaccines are more widely available. That's why vaccines are continuous ly and carefully monitored for possible side effects even after they are licensed. What are the side effects of the COVID -19 vaccine? - Early -phase studies of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine show that it is safe. However, some people developed symptoms, includi ng headache, chills, fatigue, muscle pain or fever. These reactions, which indicate a person's immune system is responding to the vaccine, resolved without complication or injury. The side effects for the COVID -19 vaccine are identical to the virus itself. If people are vaccinated and develop side effects, would they have to be tested for COVID -19? - Vaccine recipients will be provided with guidance on how to interpret side effects and what actions they should take following vaccination. How effective is th e COVID -19 vaccination? - A recent study found that the Pfizer /BioNTech COVID -19 vaccine may provide some early protection, starting 12 days after the first dose. The study also found that vaccine efficacy between the first and second doses was 52%. Seven or more days after the second dose, vaccine efficacy then rose to 95%. Efficacy is the measure of effectiveness obtained from a randomized controlled clinical trial. Further details regarding the effectiveness of the vaccine, such as how long the vaccination offers protection, are not yet available. How long will a COVID -19 vaccination offer protection? - At this time, the Moderna vaccine offers immunity of at least three months. For the other vaccines , it is not yet known how long COVID -19 vaccination will offer protection. Periodic boosters, such as with the annual flu shot , may or may not be needed. Page 3 of 4 Updated: 12/23/20 Information is subject to change Is the vaccine safe for older/elderly populations? Are they at risk of get ting COVID -19 after getting the vaccine? - The vaccines are not 100% effective but they are far better than not getting vaccine. The benefits certainly outweigh the risks in healthy older persons. One cannot get COVID -19 infection from the initial COVID -19 vaccines as they are inactivated vaccines and not live virus . Do I have to have the same brand of vaccine for both doses? - Yes. The second dose of whic hever vaccine you are given will be reserved for you. When do I get the second dose? - Pfizer/ BioNTech - 21 days after first dose - Moderna - 28 days after first dose - It is important that you get the second dose. While the first dose may provide some level of protec tion, the second dose will increase the level or protection against the virus. I already had COVID -19. Do I need to get the vaccine? - Yes. It is unknown how long natural immunity from the virus lasts, so it is still important for individuals who were pr eviously infected to get vaccinated. I already had COVID -19. How long do I need to wait to get the vaccine? - Those that had COVID -19 should delay vaccination until about 90 days from diagnosis. People should not get vaccinated if in quarantine after expos ure or if they have COVID -19 symptoms. Can people who are pregnant get the vaccine? - Yes. People who are pregnant may choose to be vaccinated. If they have questions around getting vaccinated, a discussion with a healthcare provider might help them make an informed decision. Currently, there are limited data available on the safety of COVID -19 vaccines for people who are pregnant. While studies have not yet been done, based on how mRNA vaccines work, experts believe they are unlikely to pose a risk for peop le who are pregnant. Can children get the vaccine? - No. At this time, the vaccine is only approved for adults. Scientists and researchers have begu n clinical studies with children as young as 12, but more data is needed for the FDA to approve a vaccine that is safe for children. What if I don't want the vaccine. - There is no law requiring individuals be vaccinated. Aren't masking, social distancing and self -quarantining reasonable alternatives to COVID -19 vaccination? - Given the extent of COVID -19 spread in the U.S., masking, social distancing and self- quarantining will not be enough to contain the pandemic. Developing large -scale immunity in the community through vaccination is key to stopping the pandemic. Everyone will need to continue to take precautions, such as masking and physical distancing, until the spread has stopped. Until then, COVID -19 spread can continue in the community from people who have or don't have symptoms. Page 4 of 4 Updated: 12/23/20 Information is subject to change A person can be contagious for as many as 14 days without symptoms. A perso n can develop symptoms but be contagious before symptoms start. Most healthy adults may be able to infect others, beginning two days before symptoms develop and up to 10 days after becoming sick. Can I get the COVID -19 vaccine if I got the flu vaccine? - Yes. We recommend all individuals get the flu vaccine and when it becomes available, the COVID -19 vaccine. Will persons who get the vaccine still have to wear face masks? - Yes. While the vaccine is highly effective at preventing symptomatic and severe disease, it is not 100% effective, and it is not yet known how well it prevents asymptomatic infection, or how long its effects will last. Everyone will need to continue taking precautions like masking and physical distancing until the spread has stopped. "}
