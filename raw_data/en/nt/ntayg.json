The analytical approaches for different types of vaccines are provided in these pages. Biomolecule separations HPLC Systems Charge Aerosol Detection IC Systems Mass Spectrometry Chromatography Data Systems Get high resolution, high efficiency separation of your vaccine associated biological samples. Our unique column chemistries for biological samples have been specifically designed for the separation of proteins, peptides, monoclonal antibodies, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and more. Thermo Scientific Vanquish HPLC and UHPLC systems are the most advanced liquid chromatography instruments available. The Vanquish LC platform improves performance, repeatability, and dependability with no trade-offs in quality or ease-of-use. Vanquish LC systems provide the versatility to solve the toughest vaccine analytics challenges. A highly flexible Thermo Scientific Dionex ion chromatography (IC) system provides customers with the freedom to develop, explore, and run different methods simultaneously. Utilizing unique IC technologies with unparalleled robustness and capabilities, one can accurately identify and monitor formulation and process residual components and ensure appropriate adjuvant concentrations, with ease. Utilize the increased separation speed and resolution of the Thermo Scientific Vanquish UHPLC system with charged aerosol detection (CAD). CAD can detect and quantify virtually any substance with enhanced linear dynamic range and accurate, consistent response. Measure low-level impurities and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) simultaneously, as well as other compounds, regardless of chemical structure using CAD. Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Exploris mass spectrometry (LC-MS) with record-setting performance for your next-generation of vaccine products. Extraordinary power is now available in an expanded portfolio to meet your exact analytical requirements, deliver comprehensive characterization of your most advanced vaccine drug products, and accelerate their development. [The Expanding Role of Mass Spectrometry in the Field of Vaccine Development](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29852530/) Achieve productivity and compliance with one software platform. As an integral part of your laboratory's IT structure, the latest Thermo Scientific Chromeleon 7.3 Chromatography Data System (CDS) is vital for compliant, efficient, and reliable handling of today's chromatography and mass spectrometry data. It ensures data quality and manages all the analytical processes from instrument control, to raw data storage and processing, to generating the final results.
