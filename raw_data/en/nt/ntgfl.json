(Pronounced Cha-Reese) Charisse Johns, MS, LPC, EMDR Trained I am the owner and founder of Mind-Body Connection Therapy. I am so happy you have made it to this point in your search to find a therapist. I believe that you are your own best healer and I am just a guide to help you along this journey. It takes courage to pursue recovery and healing. This journey can be very daunting and also exciting. I would be honored to walk alongside you through the ups, downs, challenges, and successes. You are not alone! My Credentials: I went to Dallas Baptist University where I got my Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Sociology and went to Texas Women's University for my Master of Science in Clinical Mental Health Counseling. I am a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC) in the state of Texas and EMDR trained (Eye Movement Desensitization). Read more in the next section for a more detailed and comprehensive list of my qualifications. Counseling Background: I began my counseling career at the Collin County Children's Advocacy Center working with kiddos, teens, and their families who experienced abuse and trauma. In addition, I gained experience working with adults 18+ struggling with severe depression, anxiety, trauma, suicidality, as well as mood and personality disorders in the PHP/IOP level of care. From there I began my journey with eating disorders by working at Eating Recovery Center as a Program Therapist and then Primary therapist working with all levels of care ranging from inpatient to Intensive outpatient. The \"why\" behind my passion: I've wanted to be a therapist since I was 16 years old by attending my own therapy after a traumatic event. I was disconnected from my body for years and my therapist taught me how to come back home, to my body, safely. I knew I wanted to be a safe person for people to come to, create a safe place where they could talk about the hard things without judgment or an agenda, and provide an environment for people to heal and grow at their own pace (paired with a gentle nudge here and there!). I see my clients choosing recovery, healing, and breaking generational patterns and it inspires me more than anything. I want you to be free from whatever is holding you back from being your best, most authentic self. It is SO worth it. Lets get personal: I am an enneagram 6 and dog mama of the best pup. I enjoy spending time outside, \"hammocking\", yoga, traveling to new places, going to concerts, and taking my dog for walks. My favorite foods are Pad Thai (or any Thai food, let's be real) as well as any kind of Tex-Mex!
