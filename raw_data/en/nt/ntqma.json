This is part of Bastyr's ongoing effort to help prevent the spread of airborne infections in clinical settings for everyone and especially for our vulnerable students, faculty, staff, and patients. This means that you must wear a mask when you enter the clinic (whether passing through to a classroom or just through the building for work/shift) and are walking within the clinic, including hallways or waiting areas, or on-shift in exam rooms and/or review/preview rooms. A mask is not required if you are in a classroom that is within the clinic nor in \"non-patient areas\" offices such as faculty offices or administrative/business offices. Front-line patient areas such as PSR desks continue to require masks, though an office behind the PSR desk does not require a mask if the door is closed to the public area. Approved masks include N-95, KN-95, and surgical masks. While the university no longer requires N-95/KN-95 masks in these clinic areas, Bastyr does recommend them, especially for those with specific vulnerabilities or the desire for extra safety (Note: N-95/KN-95 are rated higher for filtering minute particles than other kinds of masks). As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic and the changing landscape, we are continually reviewing and updating our own policies. To this end and in alignment with the CDC and most public health agencies, including those in Washington and California, Bastyr recommends that all of our students, staff, and faculty stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters. The university will no longer require COVID-19 vaccines or boosters nor documentation of such. - Washington: Individuals interested in receiving the COVID-19 Vaccine can locate appointments using the Washington Department of Health Vaccinate WA website: [https://vaccinelocator.doh.wa.gov/](https://vaccinelocator.doh.wa.gov/) - California: website: [https://myturn.ca.gov/](https://myturn.ca.gov/) - Seattle/King County: Individuals who reside or work in Seattle or King County (WA) may pre-register to receive a vaccination at one of the City-affiliated vaccination clinics here: [City of Seattle COVID-19 Vaccination Notification List](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=RR7meOtrCUCPmTWdi1T0G2oHZB0Q1AZPn08T2zoB3clUOVRHQldQNlM2WDM4OUdBN0s3REE1MUc3Sy4u) - City of Seattle - affiliated vaccination clinics: - The Lumen Field Event Center (330 S Royal Brougham Way, Seattle, WA 98134) - North Seattle College Community Vaccination Hub (9600 College Way N, Seattle, WA 98103) - Rainier Beach Community Vaccination Hub (8702 Seward Park Ave S, Seattle, WA 98118) - West Seattle Community Vaccination Hub (2801 SW Thistle St, Seattle, WA 98126) Additional information about the COVID-19 Vaccine can be found at - Washington - [https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/Vaccine](https://www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/COVID19/Vaccine) - California - [https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/](https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/) Free testing (including drive-through/walk-up testing) is available near Seattle and San Diego for anyone experiencing symptoms or who has been potentially exposed.
