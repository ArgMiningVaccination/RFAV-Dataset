It consists of different types of cells, tissues and molecules that mediate the immune response. The first non-specific line of defence is provided by the innate immune system which includes the epithelial barrier, cells that phagocytize such as neutroph ils and macrophages, dendritic cells that capture and present antigens, cells that release inflammatory mediators such as mast cells and natural killer cells1,2. The molecules that are involved in this early immune response are cytokines and plasma proteins such as complement factors and acute- phase proteins3. The innate immune response also stimulates the second line of defence, the antigen-specific acqu ired or adaptive immune response4,5. Adaptive immune responses are initiated when anti gen-receptors on lymphocytes recognize antigen. T-lymphocytes mediate cellular immunity and B-lymphocytes mediate humoral or antibody-mediated immunity. The adaptive immune system has an immunological memory, which implicates that the response to a recurrent infection by the same antigen can be more vigorously. Cellular immunity T-lymphocytes are triggered by antigens prod uced by intracellular signals are needed to establish stable TCR-APC contact. CD4 an d CD8 co-receptors recognize the MHC, adhesion molecules strengthen the binding and co-stimulators recognize secondary signals provided by the APC. When these secondary signals are not present this will lead to a state of anergy or tolerance7. In response to antigen and co-stimulators, T-lymphocytes secrete cytokines such as IL 2 which stimulate the T-cell to proliferate and differentiate into effector T-cells. CD4-positive (+) T-cells differentiate into T-helper cells phagocyt ic cells and stimulate B-lymphocytes8. CD8+ T-cells differentiate into cytotoxic T-cells th at are able to kill infected cells9. At the same time, some T-lymphocytes become memory cells th at remain inactive until re-exposure to the antigen10. Humoral immunity B-lymphocytes and antibody production B-lymphocytes have membrane bound antibodies on their surface that act as B-cell receptors (BCR) for extracellular antigens11. The immature B-cell (B1) expresses IgM as BCR and produces natural IgM antibodies; the antibodies are poly-reactive and recognize carbohydrate antigens of bacterial origin and auto-antigens. In most cases, these natural antibodies have a relative lo w affinity. Mature but naive B-cells (B2) co-12Chapter 1 express IgM and IgD antibodies as BCR. Th ese antibodies recognize and bind antigens of protein, carbohydrate or lipid origin. Similar as for the TCR, secondary signals are needed, the IgM and IgD receptors only reco gnize the antigen, th e signal transduction to the B-cell is provided by two no n-covalently attached proteins, Ig and Ig. B-cells also have a receptor for a complement protein on their surface that provides the activation signal. Upon activation by antigen, they proliferate in a process called clonal expansion and differentiate into effector plasma cells. When the activating antigen is a protein, B-cells interact with T-helper cells through their CD86 co-stimulatory molecules that subsequently stimulate B-cell proliferation and differentiation12. Plasma cells actively secrete IgM and IgD antibodies . During differentiation, a process called heavy chain isotype or class switching takes place, which means that some B-cells start to produce antibodies of a different class that mediate other effector functions13. Repeated exposure to the same antigen promotes the affinity and amount of the antibodies produced. A fraction of B2-cells do not differe ntiate into antibody secreting plasma cells but become B-memory cells that us e IgG, IgA or IgE as BCR and are able to respond rapidly when the antigen is encountered again14. Antibody structure Antibodies consist of four polypeptide chai ns, two heavy chains and two light chains that are held together by disulfide bonds. Ea ch chain has a variable N terminal (V) and a constant C terminal (C). The V regions of the light and heavy chain form the two antigen-binding arms (Fab2) that atta ch antigen through three hypervariable complementarity-determining regions15. The C regions of the heavy chain form the Fc region which specifies the immunoglobuline (I g) class and subclass. There are five Ig isotypes or classes: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM, four subclasses of IgG and two subclasses of IgA. These classes and subc lasses differ in physical appearance and function16. IgD, IgE and IgG are bivalent monomeric units, IgA a tetravalent dimer and IgM is a decavalent pentamer. Each type of antibody can be produced as a free circulating molecule or as a membrane-bound BCR17. Antibody function IgA that is secreted into the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract neutralizes microbes and their toxins. IgD and IgM are the BCR of naieve B-lymphocytes. IgE defends the body against parasites and activates mast cells to provoke immediate hypersensitivity reactions. IgM, IgG1 and IgG3 can activate complement through the classical pathway, which initiates a cascade of events ultimate ly leading to the formation of a membrane- attack complex that lyses infected cells. Ig G neutralizes microbes and their toxins, it coats microbes to promote their ingest ion by phagocytes in a process called opsonization, it also binds to infected ce lls which allows NK cells to kill them through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, IgG is involved in neonatal feedback inhibition of B-cell activation18. Introduction13 Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex is part of the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) and was first described in the 1950's. It was demonstrated that blood transfusions and pregnancies can induce the production of antibodies that reacted with HLA antigens present on human leukocytes19-21. It is now known that these HLA molecules are involved in the recognition and presentation of self and foreign antigens22. In clinical transplantatio n, they play an important role in the allo-immune response leading to graft acceptance or graft rejection23. The HLA complex is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21)24 and represents the most polymorphic genes of the human genome. The HLA genes involved in the immune response are divided into HLA class I and class II genes ba sed on structure, expression and function of the molecules they encode. The class III genes are no t related to the class I and II genes structurally or functi onally, they encode complement factors, heat shock proteins and tumor necrosis factor (Figure 1.1). Figure 1.1 Localisation of the HLA complex on chromosome 6. The HLA complex is located on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21)24 and represents the most polymorphic genes of the human genome . The HLA genes involved in the immune response are divided into HLA class I and class II genes based on structure, expression and function of the molecules they encode . HLA molecules HLA class I molecules are encoded by the HLA class I genes, HLA-A, -B and -C. They are expressed on all nucleated cells and on platelets. Class I molecules consist of two polypeptide chains, a membrane-anchored HLA chain and a non-covalently associated 14Chapter 1 chain, 2-microglobulin ( 2m). 2m is encoded by a non-polymorphic gene located on chromosome 15 and it is required for the form ation of a stable class I complex. The HLA chain is composed of three po lymorphic extracellular domains, 1, 2 and 3, which form the peptide binding groove25 (Figure 1.2). HLA class I molecules present endogenously synthesized proteins, mostly of viral origin and self proteins, to cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells26. The latest April 2010). Figure 1.2 Class I molecule. Class I molecules consist of two polypeptid e chains, the membrane-anchored HLA chain and a non-covalently associated chain, 2-microglobulin ( 2m). The HLA chain is composed of three polymorphic extracellular domains, 1, 2 and 3, which form the peptide binding groove. HLA class II molecules are the products of the HLA class II genes, HLA-DR, -DQ and -DP. They are present on the ce ll surface of professional antigen-presenting cells, like B-lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and activated T- lymphocytes. They can be upregulated on endothelial cells and rena l tubular cells in the presence of stress- induced cytokines. Class II molecules consist of two non- covalently bound transmembrane chains, the - and -chain. Both chains have two extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, 1 and 2 for the -chain and 1 and 2 for the -chain. The peptide binding groove is formed by the highly polymorphic 1 and 1 domains28 (Figure 1.3). HLA class II molecules present extracellular proteins to CD4+ T-helper cells. The physiological function of the HLA molecule is to present self and foreign peptides to lymphocytes and therefore HLA molecules pl ay an important role in the distinction between self and non-self and the proper functioning of the immune system. HLA molecules are highly polymorphic, this mean s that many different gene variants of Introduction15 each locus are present in the human population. This is illustrated by the number of alleles identified for each locus: 3.0.0 April 2010). Th e most polymorphic residues of the HLA molecules are found in or around the peptide binding groove. This polymorphism provides diversity in peptide binding specif icity and antigen presentation necessary to overcome infections caused by bact eria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Figure 1.3 Class II molecule. Class II molecules consist of two non-co valently bound transmembrane chains, the - and - chain. Both chains have two extrac ellular immunoglobulin-like domains, 1 and 2 for the - chain and 1 and 2 for the -chain. The peptide binding groove is formed by the highly polymorphic 1 and 1 domains. Typing for HLA HLA antigens have been defined by serological methods based on complement- dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) since 50 years. A variant known as the NIH microlymphocytotoxitity test was developed and standardised by Terasaki. It has been widely used for HLA typing in clinical transplantation29. Serological typing demonstrates the expressed molecule on th e cell surface. In th e CDC typing assay lymphocytes and antisera of known HLA spec ificity are incubated. Rabbit complement is then added and activated by the binding of HLA specific antibodies to the surface HLA antigens. As a result, a membrane attack complex is formed that lyses the cell membrane which becomes permeable. When a dye is added thereafter, it penetrates the membrane of the lysed cells, which can now be discriminated from living cells. Although used for many years, the CDC assa y has some distinct disadvantages such as labour intensiveness, requirement of viable cells and the lack of available monospecific alloantisera or monoclonal antibodies. 16Chapter 1 In the 1980's, molecular cloning made the id entification of gene structures possible. Together with the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction (P CR), this lead to the development of a variety of DNA based typing methods that enable detection of the HLA polymorphism at the genetic level. Se veral molecular methods were developed to type the HLA genes. The most commonly used techniques are based on PCR: Sequence specific primers (SSP), Sequ ence specific oligonucleotid e (SSOP) based typing (SBT). In the PCR-SSP method , the target DNA is amplified with primers specific for alleles or groups of alleles. For the PCR-SSOP method, the HLA gene to be typed is amplified and hybridized with probes specific for alleles or allele groups. The SBT technique is based on direct DNA sequencing to determine the nucleotide sequence of the HLA alleles present. It dete cts all polymorphism in the sequenced part of the gene and therefore enables high resolution typing and identification of new alleles. A more detailed description of these techniques is given in30. HLA antibodies HLA antibodies do not occur naturally. They are produced after contact with foreign HLA antigens. Antibody formation is initiate d by the uptake and processing of foreign antigen by antigen-presenting cells that presen t it to the CD4+ T cell. At the same time, antigen specific B2-cells re cognize, bind, internalize and process these antigens through their BCR. Clonal expansion of B-ce lls is induced when a co-stimulatory signal is present. As a result B-cells will differentiate, secrete IgG and memory B-cells will be developed7. The antigenic stimuli leading to HLA antibody formation in recipients are pregnancy21, blood transfusion19,31 and previous transplants32. Recently it has become clear that they sometimes arise in resp onse to HLA-unrelated immune stimulation33,34 and that their response is increa sed by stimuli such as infection35,36 or even vaccination37. In about 25 percent of pregnancies, women develop antibodies against paternal antigens present on the foetal cells that enter the maternal circulation38,39. The frequency of sensitization increase s with the number of pregnancies38. The level of immunization may decrease over time, but can also increase and may acquire a wider spectrum after a new antigenic challeng e such as blood transfusion or renal transplantation40. Before the introduction of erythropoietin, bl ood transfusions were frequently given to patients with end-stage renal disease. In th e past, they were also given to reduce the allo-immune response to the prospective graft41. Before the introduction of calcineurine inhibitors (CNI) as immunosuppressive agent, several studies showed that untransfused patients underwent more rejection episodes and presented with worse graft survival than transfused recipients42,43. Clinical studies showed that previously undetected historical anti-HLA antibodies from pregnancies may reappear after blood Introduction17 transfusion44. Since the introduction of CNI however, the beneficial effect of pre- transplant blood transfusions has become less clear and transfusions are also associated with primary sensitization45. Today in the Netherlands, after the results of a multicenter study demonstrated that dono r-specific transfusions induce primary sensitization and have no beneficial effect on transplant outcome, donor-specific transfusions to induce tolerance and transfusions given with the intention to detect historical sensitization, are no longer in practice46. The part of the HLA molecule that is recognized by the antibody is called epitope or determinant47. Epitopes or determinants can be \"public\" which means they are shared between HLA alleles, or \"private\" if they are specific for a certain allele48-50. HLA antigens have multiple epitopes that ca n be recognized by specific antibodies. Originally, epitopes were described on the basis of serological cross-reactivity, i.e. antibodies produced against one particular antigen may bind to other structurally similar antigens. Today, it has been shown that these epitopes correspond to distinct amino acid sequences in the HLA molecules. Epitopes may be recognized based on linear amino acid sequence or based on conf ormational shapes. Terasaki et al. have empirically identified 103 cl ass I and 83 class II epitopes defined by polymorphic amino acid residues using extensive analyses of antibody reactivity patterns51-55. Duquesnoy's HLAMatchmaker-strategy of determining HL A epitopes antibody-antigen complexes. An eplet, i.e. a conformational epitope has a so-called patch of highly energetic residues that determine the stre ngth and specificit y of the antibody binding56-61. Information about the HLA type of the antibody producer and the immunizing antigen permits the distinctio n between self and non-self amino acid residues. Each eplet has at least one non-self residue, on the molecular surface. Recently, the correlation between Terasaki's epitopes and HLAMatchmaker-defined eplets has been extensively studied and described62. About 90 percent of Terasaki's epitopes correspond to HLA Matchmaker-defined eplets. HLA and transplantation Renal transplantation remains the preferred treatment for suitable patients with end- stage renal disease. Organ replacement is pr eferred over dialysis because it provides patients with a higher quality of life63,64 and is associated with lower mortality rates65,66. In 2009, 811 patients received a kidney from a living (417) or a deceased (394) donor in the Netherlands67. The relevance of bloodgroup ABO compatibilit y in renal transplantation had already been recognized by the early 1960's. Anot her system, the MHC, was discovered and shown to be important in renal transplantat ion. The first renal transplantation with long-term success (graft and patient surv ival >1 year) was performed in 1954 by 18Chapter 1 Murray68. The donor was the monozygotic twin brother of the recipient. By then, it was known that tissues were freely intercha ngeable between identical twins. Attempts to use unrelated or deceased donors were usually unsuccessful because the allografts were recognised as foreign by the recipient\u00b4s immune system and were rejected. This situation stimulated the search for immunosuppressive therapy69-71. The introduction of immunosuppressive reagents made it possib le to transplant patients with a donor other than a monozygotic twin72,73. However, rejection rates remained high and side effects of the immunosuppression such as nephrotoxicity, in fections, metabolic disorders and cancer, were observed freque ntly. Further improvement in transplant outcome had to be found in immunological selection of the recipient-donor pairs. In transplantation, the reco gnition of the donor's HLA mo lecules by the recipient's immune system generates a strong response that is a barrier to successful transplantation74,75. When a patient receives a renal transplant from a genetically different individual, his immune system come s into contact with foreign HLA antigens present on the donor cells. The subsequent immune resp onse, allorecognition, may cause rejection of the transplant76. Presentation of the donor's HLA antigens can take place through two distinctive pathways: dire ct and indirect allorecognition. In the direct pathway, T-cells recogn ise intact allo-HLA on the surface of donor antigen- presenting cells. In the indirect pathway, donor-HLA is shed from the graft, which is then processed into allo-peptides presented by the recipients own antigen-presenting cells77,78. These two pathways are not sufficient for full activation of the recipient's immune system. A co-stimulatory signal is needed for stabilisation of the cell-cell contact. When this secondary signal is absent this will lead to a state of anergy or tolerance. The effector mechanisms in tran splant rejection and the co-stimulatory signals have been reviewed by Rocha et al.7. Transplant rejection Recognition of donor-HLA by T-cells and an tibodies can lead to graft rejection79-81. Rejection is suspected when there is a decrease in renal function. Needle core biopsy is needed to confirm clinical re jection. Based on time of occurrence, not on mechanism, different types of rejection can be discriminated: hyperacute, acute and chronic rejection. Preformed HLA antibodies are deleterious to the renal graft82,83. Antibodies produced de novo after renal transplantation are a risk factor for acute and chronic rejection84,85. Preformed donor-specific HLA antibodies cause hyperacute rejection by binding to blood vessels and activating the complement system which initiates a cascade of events leading to coagulation of platelets and immediate circulation blockage and loss of graft function within minutes to hours after reperfusion. Hyperacute rejection is observed in up to 80% of the kidneys tran splanted into recipients with preformed donor-specific HLA antibodies detected in the complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch82,86. Acute rejection can occur at any time after tr ansplantation, ranging from days to years. It is most commonly seen with in the first three to six mont hs after transplantation. For several decades, T-cells have been regarded to be the central regulatory and effector cells in acute rejection. Consequently, most current immunosuppressive therapies generally target T-cell function. Despite th e use of these drugs, episodes of acute rejection can still occur. Recent evidence shows that circulat ing antibodies and complement deposition are involved in a substantial proportion of these remaining rejection episodes, particularly in those that involve total graft failure87-89. The binding of anti-donor antibodies to the endotheliu m of the graft activates complement, which triggers the recruitement of cellular infilt rates, neutrophils and macrophages in the capillaries. In 1991, transpla nt clinicians, pathologists, surgeons, immunologists and researchers first participated in a consensu s meeting on renal allograft pathology in order to standardize the histolog ical definition of different types of rejection, held in Banff, Canada. Originally, Banff type I acute rejection was defined as a manifestation of cell-mediated immunity, type III as strong ly suggestive of an antibody-mediated process and Banff type II as a mixture of both cell- and antibody-mediated immunity. Based on the anatomical target of the immune reaction rejection was subclassified into two major categories: tubular/interstitial re jection and vascular rejection. This so- called Banff classification is regularly up dated and redefined on the basis of new developments and evaluation studies, the last update took place in 2009, with special attention to diagnostic markers for antibody-mediated rejection such as circulating donor-specific antibody and C4d staining90,91. Antibody-mediated acute rejection, also known as humoral or acute vascular reject ion, is often resistant to therapy with steroids or T-cell specific drugs92. Both cellular and antibody-mediated acute rejection episodes are more frequent in sensitized pati ents than in patients without circulating antibodies93. Chronic rejection or chronic allograft nephropathy, more than any other condition, limits the long-term success of renal transplant ation. It occurs in a later stage after transplantation and is caused by a number of processes, particularly by repeated inflammation and injury from both immunological and non-immune-mediated reactions. The non-immunological causes for deteriorated graft function and graft loss like drug toxicity, ischemia and aging are extensively reviewed elsewhere94. Chronic rejection is histopathologically characterized by obliterative vascul opathy, infiltration of leukocytes and luminal occlusion of the arteries95. As mentioned earlier, the chronic immune injury is believed to be caused by indirect presentation of allogeneic peptides by recipient antigen-presenti ng cells. Many studies on th e role of HLA antibody in chronic rejection have been published, albeit without consensus on the frequency. According to Terasaki, up to 60% of chronic rejections are supposed to be caused by 20Chapter 1 donor-specific HLA antibodies96. Piazza et al. found that circulating donor-specific HLA antibodies correlate strongly with chronic rejection97. Lee et al. described that de novo anti-HLA antibodies are always presen t before the loss of a graft from chronic rejection98. Whether (donor-specific) antibodies actually cause chronic rejection or reflect a response to a damaged graft caused by other factors has yet to be determined. HLA matching Allogeneic donor-HLA can stimulate B cells to produce alloantibodies, which are involved in the humoral immune responses against grafts, therefore the degree of HLA matching between donor and recipient greatly influences transplant outcome99. Only grafts from monozygotic twins are successful without immunosuppression. Zero mismatched transplants have a superior outcome than grafts with one or more HLA mismatches (Figure 1.4)100-102. Figure 1.4 The influence of HLA matching on graft survival within eurotransplant. Allogeneic donor-HLA can stimulate B cells to produce alloantibodies, which are involved in the humoral immune responses against graf ts, therefore the degree of HLA matching between donor and recipient greatl y influences transplant outcome99. Only grafts from monozygotic twins are successful without immunosuppression. Zero mismatched transplants have a superior outcome than grafts with one or more HLA mismatches Due to the extreme polymorphism of the HL A system, it is not feasible to find an HLA identical donor for all renal transplant recipients. To increase the donorpool and therefore the chance of providing recipients with a suitable donor, Eurotransplant was founded, the first organ exchange organisation in the world. Since then many other Introduction21 organisations e.g. Scandiatransplant, France-transplant, UK transplant and UNOS have been founded. Today, 7 countries allocate their organs through Eurotransplant on the basis of several parameters that generate tr ansplantation points, such as degree of HLA match, waiting time, cold ischemia time, and match prognostic index which means that sensitized patients and patients wi th rare HLA phenotypes receive extra points103. The effect of HLA class I and II mismatches varies over time after transplantation. According to Thorogood et al., the effect of an HLA-DR mismatch is strongest in the first five months following transplantation and therefore is associated with increased risk of acute rejection and early graft lo ss, whereas HLA-A and HLA-B mismatches are associated with later graft loss104. Traditionally, the degree of HLA compat ibility between recipient and donor is determined by counting number of mismat ched HLA-A, -B and -DR antigens of the donor. Another way to asses compatibility is structurally based HLA matching. Based on this concept, Duquesnoy56,58,105,106 created HLA Matchmaker, a matching algorithm that views each HLA antigen as a string of short linear sequences (triplets) involving amino acid residues in antibody-accessible po sitions. These triplets are considered the key elements of epitopes that can induce the formation of specific antibodies. These epitopes have two distinct characteristics, namely antigenicity, its reactivity with antibody, and immunogenicity, its ability to induce an antibody response107. The immunogenicity of an epitope depends on the structural difference between the immunizing protein and the antibody respo nder's homologous proteins. It has been shown that the effect of HLA matching on transplant success varies depending on donor and recipient risk factors. In the USA especially, many clinicians even argue that current immunosuppressive regimens obviate the benefits of HLA matching, therefore HLA-A and -B matching has been eliminated from the UNOS allocation algorithm. Many organizations still find a high correlation between the degree of matching and sensitization particularly after previous graft failure107. Therefore a poor HLA match decreases the chance of finding a second crossmatch-negative donor, prolonging waiting times for retransplantation108. In our center, minimal matching requirements are set at 1B and 1DR or 2 DR match between donor and recipient. For living donation, matching is less stringent, because of the superior quality of the donor kidney, and patients can be transplanted pre-emptive109-111. But even in the case of a living donor, well matched transplants have superior outcome. Crossmatching In 1969 the clinical relevance of preformed cytotoxic antibodies directed against donor lymphocytes was first demonstrated by Patel and Terasaki82. In their landmark study, using the complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatch (CDCXm) 80% of recipients transplanted with a positive CDCXm lost th eir graft due to hyperacute rejection, whereas less than 5% of recipients with a negative CDCXm had a bad outcome. Since 22Chapter 1 then, the CDCXm, with and without DTT to abolish IgM antibodies, has been routinely used to detect preformed donor-specific antibodies and hyperacute rejection has become a rare event in renal transplantatio n. Within Eurotransplant, the CDCXm is the mandatory crossmatch assay, being the only one generally accepted to be clinically relevant. The fact that in Patel's study, 20% of the recipients with a positive CDCXm had an uneventful post-transplant course and 5% of recipienst with a negative CDCXm experienced early graft loss, suggests that the CDCXm is limited in specificity and sensitivity. In order to increase the sensitiv ity, variations of the standard CDCXm have been used, such as the addition of antigl obulin and wash steps, prolongation of incubation time and modification of incu bation temperature. In 1983, the flow cytometry crossmatch (FCXm) was introduc ed as a more sensitive method for the detection of preformed donor-specific HLA antibodies in renal transplant recipients112. The main advantages of this method are increased sensitiv ity, differentiation between cell types and detection of non-complement-binding antibodies. Many groups reported a higher sensitivity in detecting clinically relevant antibodies, and therefore the FCXm was adopted as the standard crossm atch assay in many transplant centres in the UK and US. In our centre, FCXm was not found to be superior to the standard CDCXm with regard to clinical outcome113. In fact, transplantation with a mandatory negative FCXm would have excluded 28% of the recipients who are presently doing well after transplantation. T- and B-lymphocytes carry many different antigens on their surface, which can bind clinically irrelevant antibodies leading to false positive results. Solid-phase crossmatches that make use of soluble donor-HLA antigens coated to plates have also been investigated114-117. These crossmatches have never been used in clinical practice because of technical proble ms. The clinical relevance of crossmatching techniques with higher sensitivity than the standard CDC crossmatch is still subject of debate. In 2007, a bead-based solid-phase crossmatch was introd uced. The technique and its clinical relevance ar e described in this thesis. Screening for HLA antibodies There is abundant evidence that preformed HLA antibodies have a deleterious effect on renal graft outcome as reflected by increased rejection rates and lower graft survival in sensitized recipients118. To prevent positive pretransplant crossmatches, all sera from recipients on the waiting list are tested for the presence and specificity of HLA antibodies. The specificities detected in the serum are then listed as non- acceptable mismatches (NAM). Anti-HLA antibodies are a product of the adaptive immune system which means th at they can vary in quality and quantity over time. Therefore recipient serum is tested every three months and after every sensitizing event such as blood transfusion or previous transplant. The degree of sensitization is traditionally defined as percentage of panel reactive antibody (PRA). The traditional definition of PRA is based on the percentage of positive cells of the cell panel used for antibody detection. Patients with a PRA over 5% are called sensitized, those with a PRA Introduction23 that exceeds 85% highly sensitized. The PRA should ideally be an index of the chance to find a suitable donor with whom the re cipient will have a negative crossmatch. Therefore, PRA is better based on the exac t antibody specificit ies detected in the serum combined with the frequency of those antigens in the donor population. The PRA thus calculated is called the virtual PRA and its use is currently more promoted119,120. Most of the HLA antibodies detected in the serum of renal patients are complement- binding IgG (IgG1 and IgG3) antibodies. They have been proven clinically relevant and deleterious to the graft. However, IgG2 and IgG4 HLA antibodies are found in up to 50% of patients with previous failed grafts121. The clinical relevance of these non- complement-binding antibodies is still unresolved, mainly due to the fact that they are not detected using standard antibody detection techniques122. IgM antibodies are usually irrelevant natural or auto-antibodies, but can also be directed against HLA. A recent study showed that 17% of retransplant candidates have IgM antibodies against HLA and that in 88% of cases these are directed against donor-HLA antigens123. The effect of the IgM antibodies is still a matter of debate, some authors believe they have a protective effect on the graft but a number of case reports show that they can negatively influence graft outcome124-128. A beneficial effect on graft survival has been reported for IgA antibodies123,129,130. IgA HLA antibodies are found in about 16% of eluates from explanted renal allografts131. Special allocation programs within Eurotransplant The Acceptable Mismatch program was introduced within Eurotransplant to increase the chance of finding a crossmatch-negative donor for highly sensitized recipients with a historical or current CDC-PRA 85%. For these patients, the HLA antigens are defined towards which the recipient has not made antibodies. These antigens are then entered in the database as Acce ptable Mismatches (AM)132-134. If an ABO compatible donor becomes available, matching with the combined recipient's own and AM HLA, the graft is mandatory allocated to this patient. Pati ents enrolled in this program receive the highest priority within the allocation program. Recipients transplanted in the AM program have shorter waiting times and show gr aft survival that is identical to that of non-sensitized recipients135,136. The Eurotransplant Senior Program (ESP) aims to achieve a more efficient use of kidneys from elderly donors and promotes th eir transplantation in elderly recipients. ABO compatible kidneys obtained from donors over 65 years of age are allocated to recipients older than 65 years, regardless of HLA matching. Risk factors such as delayed graft function (DGF) and acute rejection (AR) are reduced by only including non- immunized recipients undergoing their firs t transplant. Cold ischemia time (CIT) is reduced by preferably allocating these kidn eys locally. In this pr ogram, waiting time, 24Chapter 1 DGF and CIT are reduced. Graft survival is identical and AR rates are only 5 to 10% higher than kidneys that are allocated with matching requirements137-139. Recently, a new research program was introduced, the Eurotransplant Senior DR-compatible Program (ESDP), which aims to allocate ol der donor kidneys on the basis of the ESP principle in combination with DR-compatibilit y to further reduce the need for rejection treatment and the accomp anying risk of infectious comp lications. This approach will be validated in a study where paired kidneys will be allocated through ESP and ESPD to recipients receiving a standard ized immunosuppressive regimen. Cross-over transplantation is a variant of living donation for donor-recipients pairs that are ABO and/or antibody (positive crossmat ch) incompatible. The donor of the first couple donates his or her kidney to the recipient of the second couple and vice versa140. Aim of thesis In the last 40 years, our understanding of se nsitization in renal patients, the clinical relevance of HLA antibodies and the available antibody detection techniques have evolved considerably. Recently, the new be ad-based antibody detection technology has significantly increased the sensitivity a nd specificity of HLA antibody detection. Therefore, interpretation has become an impo rtant factor in discri minating clinically relevant from non-clinically relevant antibodies detected by this technology. The aim of this thesis is to study the use of the Luminex Single antigen and Luminex crossmatch assays on antibody profiles of renal transplant patients and to compare their profiles to the ones obtained with standard antibody detection techniques. Results are correlated to clinical outcome. Chapter 1 introduces relevance of HLA and HLA antibodies in renal transplantation by giving an overview of what is known from the literature up to now. In Chapter 2 , the different techniques for antibody detection that have been used over the years are described, in particular the Luminex technology. Antibody detection by LSA is compared to the standard CDC assay by testing a large panel of well- known CDC typing sera. In Chapter 3 , the clinical relevance of preformed DSA detected by LSA only is studied in a group of highly sensitized recipients transplanted in the AM-program. All recipients were transplanted on the basis of negative CDC crossmatches, their sera had been tested for HLA antibodies by CDC and were now retested with LSA. Chapter 4 describes the appearance, persistence, specificity and effect on graft survival of DSA produced after transplantation. Multiple serum samples of a consecutive cohort of recipients without pre-transplant DSA, at least one year of renal function and a long follow-up period, were tested with LSA. In Chapter 5 DSA appearance in post-transplant sera of 56 recipients who underwent transplantectomy at different time points after Introduction25 transplantation was monitored. All recipients were DSA negative before transplantation. Production of DSA, time of appearance and antibody class were analyzed and correlated with matching grade and donor- and patient characteristics. The incidence of HLA-DP antibodies in renal patients before and after transplantation is analyzed in Chapter 6 . The epitope-specificity of the donor and the correlation between development of DSA and non-DSA were examined by comparing the HLA-DP types of patient and donor. Chapter 7 reports on the Luminex crossmatch. Pre- and post-transplant sera of 18 patients transplanted between 1997 and 1999 with a negative CDC crossmatch were tested with a new crossmatch technique, the results of which were compared to flow cytometric results obtained for the same donor- recipient combinations and to LSA antibody screening results. In Chapter 8 , the clinical significance of the Luminex crossmatch is eval uated over a 4-year period in a group of renal transplant recipients, all transplanted on the basis of a negative CDC crossmatch. Luminex crossmatches with the sera of 165 patients drawn at the time of transplantation, were performed and correlated to acute rejection and graft survival. 26Chapter 1 References 1.

Patient serum is incubated with cells of a selected HLA-typed panel to allow the formation of immune complexes. Subsequently rabbit complement is added, that binds to the immune complexes. The formation of a membrane-attack complex is induced, that lyses the cell membrane. Lysed cells are stained using a fluorescent dye. Positive and negative reactions are discriminated using an inverted microscope1,2. The reaction pattern shows the specificity of the antibodies present in the serum, using the best co rrelation of positive reactions with the HLA antigens of the panel cells. The results are expressed as a panel reactive antibody (PRA) value, defined as the percentage of cells in the panel to which the serum reacts. The composition of the cell panel is crucial, it has to take into account cross-reactivity and linkage disequilibrium of the HLA system . The size of the panel is usually 50-60 selected cells with HLA types that include most common and some rare alleles. The distribution of alleles in the cell panel should reflect the frequencies of these alleles in the local patient and donor population. The detection and assignment of class I antibo dies is generally trouble free in patients with low PRA values, in contrast to the a ssignment in highly sensitized recipients. Class II antibodies are far more difficult to detect, because the class II antigens are expressed on B-lymphocytes, which represent only 10 to 15% of the peripheral blood cells. Modifications in cell concentration and incubation time partly surpass this shortcoming3. The fact that B-lymphocytes present with both class I and II HLA antigens on their surface is another reason for the more complicated detection of class II antibodies4-6. The CDC assay detects complement-binding IgG and IgM antibodies. Most HLA antibodies are IgG, while IgM antibodi es are usually but not exclusively auto- antibodies. The clinical role of IgM HLA antibodies is doubtful, therefore sera are pretreated with dithiothreitol (DTT) to ab olish antibodies in the serum. DTT disrupts the sulphide-bonds of the IgM molecules, thereby degrading the antibodies7,8. Modifications to increase sensitivity and allow identification of non complement- binding IgG and low titered antibodies have been proposed. Extended incubation times, that permit binding of low-avidit y antibodies, wash steps that remove low- affinity antibodies and inhibitory factors and addition of anti-human globulin (AHG), that allows detection of low-level or non-complement-binding antibodies, are examples of these modifications9-11. Technical problems of the CDC assay include la bour intensiveness, need of viable panel cells and the interference of certain agents present in the test-serum as ATG for example12. Nevertheless extensive experience exists with this technique. The major 36Chapter 2 advantage of the assay is that it reflects more than any other test the situation in vivo, the HLA antigens used as antibody-target are unaltered and have not been manipulated. And most importantly, the clinical relevance of CDC-detected antibodies has been clearly established13,14. Many of the problems involved using cell-based assays, such as need for viable cells, presence of auto-antibodies and difficulty to distinguish class I from class II antibodies, were resolved when solid-phase antibody detection assays became available. The assays are more sensitive, require only small amounts of serum and reading is objective and can be automated15,16. The tests use soluble or recombinant HLA molecules adhered to trays (ELISA) or microspheres as antibody target17. The latter bead-based assays are run on a flow cytometer (FlowPRA)18 or are multiplexed on a Luminex platform (LABScreen)19. They are more sensitive in detecting low-titer antibody than the ELISA assay20. oduced in 199317. The ELISA assay uses soluble or recombinant HLA molecules, adhered to plastic plates as antibody target. The HLA molecules are immuno-precipitated from platelets or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed B-lymphocyte cell lines. When serum is added to the plate, only HLA antibodies will bind. Enzyme-conju gated antibody to human IgG is added to detect bound IgG antibody. If HLA antibodies are present in the serum, the resulting optical density values will reflect this. Two types of assays are commercially available. One consisting of wells containing a pool of class I or class II antigens that gives a negative or positive result. In the second one HLA molecules of one individual are present per well, thus allowing PRA value determination as well as determination of HLA specificity. Class I and II antibodies are easily distinguished and isotype-detection is limited to one immunoglobulin class, usually IgG17,21,22. By changing the isotype of the secondary anti-human antibody in the assay, one can detect other isotypes, for instance IgM23. The assay is more sensitive than CD C, it detects complement-binding antibodies and non-complement-binding antibodies simultaneously. A possible drawback of the method is that the HLA molecules on the plates, are manipulated before being bound to the artificial surface, thus the natural conformation of the molecule may be altered, which can result in false-positive and false-negative reactions of the test. Detection of HLA antibodies with special emphasis on the Luminex Single antigen assay 37 Bead-based assays The need to measure and quantify multiple analytes at the same time lead to the development of particle or bead-based flow cytometric assays. Small cell-sized polysterene or latex microbeads were already used to calibrate first commercial flow cytometers in the early 1980's. Shortly therea fter latex, polysterene, polyacrylamide or glass microspheres were being used as the solid support for a variety of molecular reactions that were analyzed by a flow cy tometer. The first beads used to quantify soluble analytes were labelled latex beads or fluorescent beads. Conventional flow cytometers with the appropriate lasers for the fluorochromes could aquire the microbead emission data24. In the late 1990's, the Luminex corporation developed the FlowMetrix system. This system consisted of 64 beads impregnated with a distinct proportion of red and orange fluorescent dyes. The unique properties of these beads were their size, stability, unifo rmity and their capacity to ab sorb and retain fluorescent dye. Different assays that make use of these beads were developed, for instance an assay to quantify multiple cytokines simul taneously at the protein level. Data acquisition for these assays was done on a conventional flow cy tometer connected to a digital signal processor. The microbeads we re excited at 488 nm by an argon laser. The orange and red fluorescence of the internal dyes of the beads is detected by the FL2 and FL3 detectors of the flow cytometer. The green reporter dye, which is a measure for the amount of analyte bound to the surface of each bead is detected on the FL1 detector. The dyes emit light at 580 and 660 nm, the reporter dye emits light at 519 nm. A disadvantage of this system was the need to compensate for the spectral overlap between the FL1 and FL2/FL3 detectors25. To resolve this problem, flow analyzer (Luminex\u00a9, Austin,Tx) and xMAP microbeads were developed. This system provided a high signal-to-noise ratio for detection of low-level fluorescence. The Luminex xMAP technology was designed to measure soluble analytes. The system is based on flow cytome try and can simultaneously analyze up to 100 analytes in a single test sample. Luminex xMAP microspheres or beads are highly uniform, polystyrene particles, 5.6 micron in size, that are internal ly dyed with varying amounts of red and infrared fluorochromes. In this way, 100 microspheres were created with a unique spectral signature de termined by their red/infrared mixture (Figure 2.1). The surface of the beads a llows simple chemical coupling of capture reagents such as cytokines, DNA probes, antibodies and antigens. The Luminex flow analyzer is equipped with a digital signal processor and two lasers. The 532 nm YAG laser excites the R-phycoerythrin (PE) repo rter molecule, which is a measure for the amount of analyte bound to the bead, upon excitation it emits light at 578 nm. The 635 nm red diode laser excites the two cl assification dyes imbedded in the beads, upon excitation by the laser they emit light at 658 and 712 nm (Figure 2.2). In this system, there is no overlap between the bead s and the reporter molecules. Automated sample acquisition is made possible by the X- Y platform for reading 96-well microtiter plates26-28. X-map beads to develop in-house assays as an array of commercial 38Chapter 2 assays became available. The different commercial assays to detect HLA antibodies are described below. Figure 2.1 Luminex xMAP microspheres. Luminex xMAP microspheres are highly uniform, polystyrene particles, 5.6 micron in size, internally dyed with varying amounts of red and infrared fluorochromes. This way, 100 microspheres were created with a unique spectr al signature determined by their red/infrared mixture. Figure 2.2 The Luminex flow analyzer. The Luminex flow analyzer has two lasers. The 63 5 nm red diode laser exci tes two classification dyes imbedded in the beads, they emit light at 658 and 712 nm . The 532 nm green YAG laser excites the R-phycoerythrin (PE) reporter mole cule, which is a measure for the amount of analyte bound to the bead, upon exci tation it emits light at 578 nm. Detection of HLA antibodies with special emphasis on the Luminex Single antigen assay 39 FlowPRA In the bead-based flow cy tometric assays (FlowPRA) (Onelambda\u00a9, Canoga Park, CA) were introduced, one to determine the PRA value of the test serum and another to define the antibody specificity29,30. For these assays, HLA antigens are purified from EBV transformed cell lines by cell lysis and affinity chromatography with monomorphic monoclonal antibodies specific for class I and II HLA antigens. They are directly linked to uniform latex beads. In the FlowPRA screening assay, a pool of 30 class I antigens are bound to non-fluorescent beads and a second pool of 30 class II antigens to fluorescent beads. The specific cl ass I and class II assays consist of 4 groups of 8 microbeads with different fluorescent properties, each coated with purified HLA antigens from individual cell lines which allow analysis of the antibody specificities. The FlowPRA sp ecific assay is performed by incubating serum with beads to allow HLA-specific antibodies to adhere to the molecules on the bead's surface. After washing, FITC-conjugated F(ab)2 fragments of goat anti-human IgG are added, which bind to the IgG HLA antibodies. Upon excitation of the beads, the fluorescence is analysed using a flow cytometer. Each of the eight beads has a unique PE fluorescence that emits light at 580 nm and is measured by the FL2 detector. The fluorescent signal of the FITC is emitted at 519 nm and is detected on the FL1 detector. Positive bead reactions show a FL1 channel shift on the FL1 versus FL2 dot blot when compared to the negative control serum and the control bead. A detailed description of the assay is given by Pei et al.30. For patients with high PRA, it is difficult to determine the exact sp ecificities present in the serum with these assays, because one sin gle reaction may be caused by multiple HLA molecules present in the beads. As descri bed by Pei et al., th e search for so called Single antigens that can be used for antibody testing has been ongoing since 1979. Monoclonal antibodies and an E. Coli expre ssion system have been used with limited success until 2002, when a new mammalian cell expression system of HLA-transfected cells was developed using recombinant DNA technology. HLA antigens purified from these transfectants by cell lysis and affinity chromotography were then coated onto FlowPRA beads. The Single antigen panel allows the identification of formerly masked specificities in patients with broad sensitisation31. An important limitation of the commercially available FlowPRA assays is that only 4 groups of 8 (maximum 11) beads can be separated due to the spectral overlap between PE (beads, FL2) and FITC (FL1), As mentioned before this problem was overcome by the development of the Luminex xMAP technology. LABScreen assays The LABScreen assays (Onelambda\u00a9, Canoga Park, CA) use beads coated with purified HLA molecules as target for antibody detection. By using the Luminex multi-analyte 40Chapter 2 sytem, up to one hundred beads are combin ed in a single test sample. The LABScan 100 flow analyser is used for data acquisitio n and analysis. There are 3 variants of the test presently available: the Mixed, the PR A and the Single antigen assay. The Mixed assay consists of beads with a large number of class I or class II HLA molecules bound to their surface which detect the presence of HLA antibodies and provides a negative or positive test result. The PRA test determ ines the specificity of the HLA antibodies using beads coated with the fenotype equiva lent of one cell, thus two HLA molecules present for each locus. In the Single antigen assay the beads are coated with single recombinant antigens from transfected human cell lines, which allow accurate definition of the HLA antibody specificities present in the serum. To date, the Single antigen panel contains all of the most frequent ly observed HLA alleles, 98 class I alleles (31 A, 51 B and 16 Cw) and 65 class II (34 DR, 14 DQ and 17 DP) are included (http://www.onelambda.com). All assays are performed in a 96-well plat e, which allows simultaneous testing of 95 patient sera and one negative control serum. Patient sera, stored frozen at -30\u00b0C, are centifugated at 10.000g for 10 minutes prior to testing. Five \u00b5l of the appropriate beadmixture are vortexed and incubated with 20 \u00b5l of patient serum for 30 minutes to allow the binding of HLA antibody to the HLA molecule on the bead. After three washes with 200 \u00b5l of diluted wash buffer to remove unbound antibody, the beads are incubated for 30 min with 100 \u00b5l of an tihuman-IgG-conjugated phyco-erythrine (anti-IgG-PE), diluted 1:100 with wash buffer. After another two washes to remove unbound anti-IgG-PE, 80 \u00b5l of phosphate-buffer solution is added (Figure 2.3). Incubations are performed on a gently rotating platform in the dark at room temperature. All beadmixtures contain a positive control bead coated with IgG and a negative control bead without HLA molecule s. A negative control serum is run with every assay, it is used to establish the background value for each bead in the mixture. The LABScan 100 flow analyser (Luminex\u00a9, Austin, TX) and HLA-Visual software (One Lambda\u00a9) are used for data acquisition and analysis. The Luminex 100 analyzer is a flow cytometer with an excitation system that comprises two solid-state lasers that illumi nate the beads as they flow through it in a single file. The red classification laser exites both the in ternal red and infrared dyes of the bead, allowing classification of the microbead. The green reporter laser excites the fluorescence of the PE molecules bound to the HLA antibodies on each of the beads. The fluorescent signal of the PE label, whic h is a measure for the amount of antibody bound to the bead, is expressed as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) value per bead. The results of the analysis of each sample are incorporated in data-files (CSV). CSV files contain data on the number of events for each bead and the MFI value for each event. These files are then interpreted by the HLA- Visual software that generates graphs of the results per serum. On the X-axis all be ads and the HLA molecules on their surface are listed. On the Y-axis, the MFI per bead can be read. Detection of HLA antibodies with special emphasis on the Luminex Single antigen assay 41 Figure 2.3 LABScreen Single antigen assay. Single antigen beads are incubated with patient serum to allow the binding of HLA antibody to the HLA molecule on the bead. After thre e washes to remove unbound antibody, the anti-human-IgG antibody labelled with fluore scent phyco-erythrine (P E) label is added. Unbound secondary antibody is removed by washing. A serum's reactivity can be assessed by th e fluorescent signal for each HLA coated bead (MFI) after correction for non-specific binding to the negative control bead. All data are then normalized to the results obtained with the negative control serum. For the Mixed assay, the normalized MFI value e quals the MFI value of the class I or class II coated beads minus the MFI value of the negative control bead. For the PRA and Single antigen assay, the normalized MFI value for each bead equals the MFI value of the bead divided by the MFI value of the negative control bead. The value obtained is then divided by the normalized MFI value for each bead obtained with the negative control serum, which equals the MFI value of the bead with the negative serum divided by the MFI value of the negative control bead wh en tested with the negative serum. This normalized background ratio is then used to assign the streng th of each bead reaction and to divide the beads in groups with strength 8, 6, 4, 2 or 0. Which of these scores is assigned as positive or negative is defined by the user. The LABScan 100 flow analyzer has to be calibrated before every use with calibration and control beads. For all assays, the bead count for each kind of bead should be over 50. The MFI value of the negative control bead should be lower than 500 or 1500 for high-background sera and less than half of the MFI value of the positive control bead. The MFI of the positive control bead shou ld be over 500 and at least twice the MFI value of the negative control bead. Benefits, limitations and modifi cation of bead-based assays The Luminex technology is shown to be more sensitive in detecting HLA antibodies than CDC and ELISA assays32-34. Because bead-based assays make use of total IgG as SA bead with HLA-A2Anti-HLA-A2 ab Anti-IgG with PE label SA bead Anti-IgG with PE labelAnti-IgG with PE label42Chapter discrimi nate between complement-binding and non- complement-binding antibodies. Because the clinical relevance of non-complement- binding antibodies is still unclear, several modi fications of the assays have been tested to solely detect complement-binding antibodies. Wahrmann et al. adapted the FlowPRA assay by using human serum as the source of complement C4d, which binds to the beads in the presence of complement-binding antibodies. A FITC-labeled anti-C4d antibody was used for detection35. Smith et al. also modified the Single antigen assay, they used human serum as the source of complement again but used a mouse anti-human C4d monoclonal antibody and a PE- donkey anti-mouse IgG for detection of complement-binding antibodies36. Several other investigators replaced the total IgG with the individual isotypes, i.e. IgG1,2,3 or 4 37,38. The major advantage of the Single antigen assa y is that it allows accurate evaluation of sera containing complex mixtures of antibodies. Class I and class II antibodies are clearly discriminated. Furthermore, antibodi es directed against HLA-DRB3,4,5, HLA-DQ and HLA-DP are are available, as well as beads for detection of antibodies against MHC class I chain-related (MICA) molecules39-41. Even antibodies directed against some alle lic specificities can now be detected42-45. Using the Single antigen assay, it has become clear that many sera with multiple specificities reacted with epitopes shared by several HLA molecules46-49. Based on the specificities found using these assays, a so-called virtual PRA can be calculated. This virtual PRA value is based on the anti gen frequencies in the local donor population to which the recipient has antibodies50,51. The virtual PRA predicts the chance to find a positive crossmatch and results in a so-called \"virtual\" crossmatch52-56. The strength of the antibody detected can be measured by converting MFI values in molecular equivalent fluorescent (MESF) values using specific calibration beads57. When bead-based assays were first introduc ed and their results compared to those of cell-based assays, some discrepancies were encountered. Bray et al.58 describe a serum with a positive FCXm but negative FlowPRA screening. They hypo thesized that this discrepancy was caused by an epitope that is recognized by antibody on the intact cell membrane, but not on bead-bound protein. According to them this could be due to separation of the HLA from the 2m chain which could lead to an altered class I morphology; either alteration of epitopes during bead preparation or altered conformation of the protein once adhered to the bead. Gebel et al.59 describe a similar case, they assume the discrepancy to be due to allelic variation or lesser density of HLA antigens expressed on beads than on livi ng cells. Bray also describes a serum with a negative FC-Xm but a positive FlowPRA screening, which might be caused by antibody binding to epitopes that are in accessible on the cell membrane but become accessible on the bead58. Recently, it was shown that IgM antibodies present in recipient serum can sterically hinder IgG antibody detection because they are Detection of HLA antibodies with special emphasis on the Luminex Single antigen assay 43 pentamers and thus larger than IgG antibodies. This inhibition can be removed by either hypotonic dialysis or DTT treatment of the sera60-62. Comparison of LSA and CDC assays The cut-off point for positivity of the Luminex Single antigen assay has to be defined by the user and therefore may differ considerably between laboratories. To clarify how the results of the assay compare to those of the CDC assay, we decided to test a number of well-known HLA sera in both techniques. The sera used for this validation were CDC HLA typing sera that have been used in our lab as well as in many others all over the world for over 20 years. Both CDC specificity and reaction strength of each serum were well-defined. The main strong specificity as well as occasional extra reacting weak specificities are given in Table 2.1. A total of 103 well-known HLA typing sera were used, 73 for class I and 26 for class II. They were tested with the LSA class I an d II test respectively. The normalized MFI values obtained were divided in 5 areas: values less than 2000 (score 0), 2000-4000 (score 2), 4000-8000 (score 3), 8000-12000 (s core 4) and values over 12000 (score 5). For each serum the main CDC specificity and the extra specificities if present, were categorized according to their MFI value in one of these areas. For the HLA class I typing sera, all main specif icities were detected to have a score 3 or higher, most of them score 4 and 5. None were found with an MFI value below 4000. For the weaker extra specificities 98% reacted with score 3 or higher (132/135), 2% of the reactions were found in the score 2 area, none had values under 2000 MFI. Altogether 99 % of all class I CDC specificities had an MFI va lue of 4000 or more in the LSA assay. For the HLA class II typing sera, 94% of the main specificities were found to have a score 3, 4 or 5, 6% were found with MFI values between 2000-4000. From the extra reactions 88% reacted with score 3 or higher. Thus in total, 92 % of all class II CDC specificities showed an M F I v a l u e o f 4 0 0 0 o r m o r e w h e n t e s t e d w i t h L S A . T h e results for all sera are summarized in Table 2.2. 44Chapter 2 Table 2.1A Main and extra CDC specificities of 73 HLA class I typing sera.

For the main and weak extra class II specificities, the median values were 11.037 (2.914-17.659) and 7.797 (2.369-16.559) (Table 2.3). 46Chapter 2 Table 2.3A MFI values of main and weak extra class I CDC specificities in the LSA class I assay.

CDC specificities median MFI range of 7797 2369-16559 Total 10069 2369-17659 The increased sensitivity of the LSA obviou sly results in a much larger number of specific HLA antibodies than those detected in CDC. The numbers of these additional specificities demonstrated in the sera using LSA are given in Table 2.4. The majority of the antibodies are most likely non-complement binding antibodies, they are mainly found in the score 3 area. Some of them ar e directed against less common HLA alleles, which means that they might have been missed by the CDC test. On average 11 additional LSA specificities per serum we re found for class I, while only one was detected for class II. Table 2.4 Number of HLA specificities only detected by the LSA. Single Antigen Score (MFI) 5 4 3 >12000 12000-8000 8000-4000 Class I (73 sera) 45 237 505 Class II (26 sera) 6 25 11 Together with the transplantation clinicians we decided that in our centre, the cut-off point for positivity of the LSA would be 4000 MFI for clinical transplant purposes, based on the results obtained with the typing sera. This means that a number of CDC undetected, non-complement binding anti bodies are excluded for a given patient but we feel confident that with this cut-off point all specificities detected by CDC are covered and listed as not acceptable anti gens for a transplant recipient.

Hum 51 Chapter 3 Clinical relevance of pret ransplant donor-directed antibodies detected by Single antigen beads in highly sensitized renal transplant patients EM van den Berg-Loonen, EV CEM Background Highly sensitized (HS) patients (> 85% panel-reactive antibodies) have a lower chance of receiving a donor kidney. Within Eurotransplant the Acceptable Mism atch (AM) program was developed to increase the chances of HS patients to receive a crossmatch nega tive donor kidney. The standard crossmatch in the AM program is based on complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Methods In this study we wanted to determine the clinical relevance of human leukocyte antigen donor-directed antibodies (DDA) detected by the Single antigen (SA) bead technique , in the pretransplant sera of HS patients transplanted in our center through the Eurotransplant AM program. Results From 34 AM patients, 27 were transplanted with 1 to 5 mismatches and 7 received a 0- mismatched graft. From the mismatched patients, retrospectively, 13 pr oved to possess pretransplant DDA by SA whereas 14 did not. No antibodies were found in the 0-mismatch ed group. Comparison of the DDA+ and DDA- patients in the human leukocyte antigen-mism atched donor/recipient combinations revealed a trend to an earlier and higher number of rejection episodes in DDA+ pati ents (P=0.08). No detrimental effect of DDA on graft survival was observed. Conclusions This single-centre study showed that in the AM prog ram DDA detected by SA and not by less- sensitive methods, may be related to acute rejection episodes but is not detrimental to long-term graft outcome. These findings question the increasing use of more-sen sitive screening techniques for the allocation of organs. Clinical relevance of pretransplant DDA detected by SA beads in HS renal transplant patients 53 Introduction Patients with a sensitization of 85% or more panel reactive antibodies (PRA) are generally considered to be highly sensitized (HS). They have a lower chance of receiving a donor-kidney offer than other pati ents on the waiting list. The sensitization is caused by pregnancies, blood-transf usions, or previous transplants. There are two strategies to facilitate transp lantation in HS patients. One is increasing the chance of finding a crossmatch-negative donor, for example, by determination of acceptable human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches, and the other removal of HLA antibodies by desensitization, for ex ample, with intravenous immunoglobulin- based protocols. Within Eurotransplant (E T) the Acceptable M ismatch (AM) program consists of a special HS waiting list that allo ws patients with a current or historical sensitization of 85% or more PRA to enter1,2. Acceptable mismatches are defined as those mismatches against which the recipient has never made antibodies and are considered to be acceptable as mismatch on the potential donor organ. A blood group compatible deceased donor that becomes available and is HLA-A,-B,-DR matched with the recipient's antigens, including the AM antigens, is first offered to the HS patient waiting list. The standard crossmatch performed in the AM program is the complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatch. Patients transplanted in the program have a 1-year graft survival similar to that of nonsensitized patients within ET3. Screening techniques of higher sen sitivity than CDC and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), such as the Single antigen (SA) bead assay have been introduced recently4,5. In this assay, color-coded microspheres coated with single HLA antigens are used to identify HLA class I and II antibodies in patient sera. The test detects both complement-binding and non-complement-binding HLA antibodies using anti-human IgG as secondary antibody. Mo re and more laboratories rely on the detection of specificities demonstrated by these types of assays, and use the information obtained for allocation of dono r organs. The clinical relevance, however, has not been studied systematically, nor has it been proven. In this study we wanted to determine the presence or absence of HLA donor-directed antibodies (DDAs) by the SA Luminex bead technique in the pretransplant sera in a cohort of highly immunized patients that entered the ET AM program and were transplanted in our center. Th ese patients were transplanted on the basis of a negative CDC crossmatch. Their post-transplant course was studied to evaluate the clinical relevance of the DDA specificities detected. 54Chapter 3 Materials and Methods Patients and donor Thirty-four patients with PRA greater than 85% from the Maastricht Transplant Center entered the ET AM program and were transplanted between 1989 and 2006. Acceptable mismatches were determined by means of crossmatches with selected donors or by extensive screening protocols. Since 2001, also the HLA matchmaker algorithm has been used in the determination of acceptable mismatches6. From 34 patients seven were transplanted with a 0-mismatched donor, the remaining 27 with 1 to 5 mismatches. There were 12 first and 15 retransplants. Organ donors were offered through the ET organ exchange organization, and typed or retyped by the Maastricht laboratory. All relevant crossmatches with current and historical patient sera were performed in the recipient center. All grafts were from heart-beating donors, except two from non-heart-beating donors. Immunosuppression The immunosuppressive regimen was calcineuri n inhibitor-based triple drug therapy for all recipients. Calcineurin inhibitor was cyclosporine (CsA; 8, mo fetil in 15, sirolimus in 2 and FK778 in 2 recipients. None of the patients receiv ed induction therapy with antilymphocyte globuline or IL2-receptor antagonist. determined blood by enzyme monoclonal immuno test (Dade Behring, Newark, DE) or high performance liquid chromotography-MS/MS. In the first 3 months after transplantation, target CsA trough levels were 0.10 to 0.15 mg/l, afterwards decreasing to 0.05 to 0.10 mg/l. TAC trough levels were measured in whole blood by Imx (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) or high performance liquid chromotography-MS/MS; target levels were 15 to 20 ng/ml for weeks 1+2 and 10 to 15 ng/ml for weeks 3+4, thereafter tapering to 5 to 7 ng/ml. Clinical outcome parameters A biopsy was taken during surgery 1 hour after reperfusion for every transplant. Rejection was defined as any rejection treatment within 3 months after grafting. All rejection episodes were proven by needle core biopsy. No fresh frozen material for C4d staining was available because of the retrospective design of the study. Rejection treatment consisted of three doses of methylprednisolone (0.5-1.0 g/dose) or a 10-day course of antithymocyte globulin for vascular rejections. Graft failure was defined as failure of graft, but also includ ed death with functioning graft. Clinical relevance of pretransplant DDA detected by SA beads in HS renal transplant patients 55 Center policy of tissue typing During the study period all patients were typed for HLA-A, -B, -DR and -DQ. Typings were initially performed by serology; from 1994, class II was DNA typed by polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific primers and from 2004 class I as well. Recently, all recipient and donor typings have been repeated with molecular techniques (SSO Luminex) to ascertain the exact number of mismatches. HLA antigens were considered unacceptable for a patient, if antibodies against the specificity had ever been demonstrated, either at the time of transp lantation or in the past. Mismatches from previous transplants were excluded, as were the paternally inherited antigens of children in female patients. CDC crossmatches of peak and current patient sera had to be negative with and without DTT in order for the transplant to be performed. Screening for human leukocyte antigen antibodies All recipient sera had been screened before transplantation for the presence of class I and class II antibodies . The routine antibody detection technique during the whole period, 1989 to 2006, was CDC. Both class I and class II DR antibodies were determined using the two-color fluorescence technique on unseparated PBLs. Reading was performed with automated Leitz inverted fluorescence microscopes. In 2002 a generic ELISA test (LAT-M, One Lambda, Inc., Canoga Park, CA) as well as ELISA identification test (Quick-ID, GTI Diagnostics, Brookfield, WI and LAT-M, One Lambda) for class II DR-antibodies was added to our screening st rategy. The generic test was used as a prescreening test, the identification tests for better definition of class II DR antibodies. For all recipients, acceptable mismatches were defined by performing CDC crossmatches with selected panel cells, differing for only one antigen with the patient, or by determining the negative an tigens in relevant sera by extensive CDC, and since 2002, also by Elisa screening. For this study a ll historical relevant sera and the current serum have now been retested with class I and II SA Luminex beads (One Lambda) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS, Cary, NC; version 12.0.1 for Windows). Groups were compared by non- parametric tests. Kaplan -Meier survival analysis was performed to analyze differences in rejection-free survival and graft survival (log-rank statistic). 56Chapter 3 Results Mismatches and antibodies From 34 recipients, 27 were transplanted wi th 1 to 5 AM mismatches, the remaining 7 received a 0-mismatched graft. Their pretransplant characteristics are given in Table 3.1. The relevant sera of all patients in the study were retested by Luminex class I and II SA bead assay. Patients who receiv ed a 0-mismatched graft never showed the presence of donor-directed HLA antibodies in their relevant pretransplant serum. From the 27 mismatched patients, 13 presented wi th DDA in the relevant pretransplant serum and 14 had no detectable antibodies. The positive patients showed a class I or II antibody in 11 and 2 patients, respectively. The two groups of mismatched patients were compared; the 0-mismatched patients were excluded from the analysis. The number of mismatches, the actual mismatched antigens, the DDAs found, and PRA values for peak and current serum are given in Table 3.2. Table 3.1 Pretransplant recipient characteristics (n=27).

For the peak sera, more rejections were seen in the DDA+ than in the DDA- group (six vs. two). The rejections in the DDA+ group occurred earlier after tr ansplantation (days 5-21) than in the DDA-group (days 35-44). In three patients the rejection was treated with antithymocyte globulin; two were on TAC and one on CsA, two were DDA+ and one was DDA- (Table 3.2). However, rejection- free survival was 83% for the DDA- and 54% for the DDA+ group. The difference in actuarial rejection-free survival did not reach statistical significance (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis; log-rank statistic: 3.1, 1df, P=0.08; Figure 3.1). For the current sera three patients were shown to have lost their DDA, one patient from the DDA- group was shown to possess DDA at the time of transplant. Analysis of the current pretransplant sera in both groups showed comparable rejection-free DDA-, DDA detected by SA beads in HS renal transplant patients 57 Table 3.2 Mismatches and antibodies detected by the SA bead assay in sera of recipients transplanted in the AM program and their transpl ant and outcome characteristics.

Two primary non-function failures were in the DDA- group. Both patients received a graft from an older donor, one had persistent hypotension. The other two failures were in the DDA+group. By Kaplan Meier survival analysis, it was found that graft survival up to 8 years did not differ significantly between the DDA groups (log-r ank statistic: 0.27, 1df, P=0.60; Figure 3.2). Graft survival was not different when the analysis was performed for current serum (P=0.75).

From the mismat ched patients 13 proved to possess pretransplant DDA when tested retrospectiv ely with the SA Luminex beads, whereas 14 did not. No antibodies were found in the 0 mm group. Comparison of the two mismatched groups revealed a trend to an earlier and higher number of rejection episodes in the DDA+ group; however, DDA po sitivity did not have a detrimental effect on graft survival. The difference in rejection rate did not reach statistical significance with the limited size of the patient groups. The results were similar when the current pretransplant serum was used for DDA definition. The SA Luminex bead assay is a very sen sitive and specific sc reening method for HLA class I and II antibodies. The antibodies detected are both complement-binding and non complement-binding. One can not differentiate between these antibodies, because the secondary antibody in the test is anti-human tota l IgG. The clinical impact of cytotoxic complement-binding DDA is well known. The DDA detected here were mainly class I, only 2 of 13 patients sh owed class II antibody. Rejection episodes showed the same distribution; five in class I-positive and one in class II-positive patients. The antibody specificities detect ed were against antigens common in the Dutch population. In this study we were not ab le to prove a clear clinical impact of the DDA detected by the SA Luminex test. Alth ough there might be an effect on the occurrence of rejection episodes, it is obvious that the DDA detected are not detrimental to long-term graft outcome. This poses questions to the clinical relevance of antibodies detected by Luminex bead- based screening tests but not in CDC. In this single-center study, the AM program without induction therapy results in long- term graft survival, which is identical to th e results obtained by the Dutch transplant registry for deceased heart-beating donors. Donor-directed antibodies detected by SA Luminex beads and not by less- sensitive methods, might be related to acute rejection episodes but seemed not to be detrimental to long-term graft outcome. These findings question the ongoing use of more and more sensitive techniques in allocation of organs. Although this single-center study comprises only a relatively small number of patients and confirmation of the findings in a larger patient group is necessary, these findings are important in view of the fact that presently a lot of effort and money is spent on desensitization prot ocols to remove DDA, detected in these sensitive assays, in patients before transplantation. 60Chapter 3 References 1.

Pre-transplant DSA-negative recipients with at least one year renal function and a follow-up time of up to 14 years was monitored for the production of DSA in 1107 sera by the Single antigen assay. Presence of DSA was shown in 224 sera of 35 recipients (class I/II/I+II in 11/20/4). In 17 patients transient DSA were found, present for a short period of time and not reappearing during follow-up (class I/II/I+II in 9/7/1). Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) considerably pe and transient DSA (median 12.000 versus 3.000). In multivariate analysis class II DSA persisting or appearing after the first year post- transplant was the only independent risk factor for graft failure (OR=3.2). For transient DSA patients both class I and II positivity showed a comparable risk of gr aft failure as DSA-negative recipients. Thus, class II DSA positivity was predictive of graft failure if presen t after the first year post-transplant. The presence of transient DSA did not affect graft failure. Persistent DSA was shown to have 4 times higher MFI values, nevertheless many DSA positive patients had grafts with stable function. HLA class II DSA persisting or appearing >1 yr after Tx are related to graft loss 63 Introduction Despite the improvement of current imm unosuppressive regimens, HLA antibodies continue to be a risk factor for kidney transplant failure. Until recently it has been difficult to study the development of HL A antibodies in recipients because the methods available for their detection were insensitive and cumbersome. However the new detection technolo gies provide the possibility to define more specific their significance in patients before and after transplantation. The presence of pre-transplant cytotoxic donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA) is a major cause of graft loss1,2. The development of DSA after renal transplantation is associated with acute and chronic reje ction, and a declin e in graft survival3-6. The results from a collaborative prospective inte rnational study showed that patients with HLA antibodies had graft failure at a significantly higher rate than patients without graft failure7. Many authors have described similar results8,9,10 and HLA antibodies therefore are considered to be a major ca use of kidney allograft failure. This has led many laboratories to post-transplant HLA anti body testing of their recipients, in order to predict graft failure11,12. In many of the studies described, the patient population included recipients with pre-transplant DS A or was restricted to recipients who rejected their graft12,13. The number of serum samples tested per patient was limited, the methods used were of intermediate sen sitivity (ELISA), and clinical follow-up time was short. The present paper is a detailed analysis of the frequency and features of HLA DSA, particularly whether and when the presence of post-transplant anti-HLA class I and/or II DSA leads to graft failure. This study diffe rs from most other studies in that it includes a cohort of consecutive renal transp lant recipients, some of whom have lost their graft but most still have functioning transplants. The presence of DSA is monitored from the moment of transplantation up to 15 years thereafter. All patients were proven DSA negative before transplantation, had at least 1 year of renal function and an average of 8 serum samples was tested per patient. Sera were collected before and after transplantation up to graft failure and DSA were determined with the Luminex Single antigen assay. The time of appearance, persistence, specificity, and antibody class of DSA were analyzed, as well as their effect on graft survival. Materials and Methods Patients The patients included in the study were 1 40 consecutive kidney transplant recipients with at least one year of renal function. All were DSA negative before transplantation 64Chapter 4 as assessed by the Luminex Single antigen assay. They were transplanted at the University hospital of Maastricht from Ja nuary 1995 until January 1999 and clinical follow-up was continued through January 2010. Hundred-twenty were first transplants and 20 were re-transplants. Patient, donor a nd transplant characteristics are listed in Table 4.1. Serum samples were collected at the time of transplantation and at regular intervals thereafter. Multiple serum samples were available for the recipients included in the study: a sample immediate pre-transplant, at month 3, month 6, year 1, and preferably one for every year thereafter up to July 2009, graft failure or death. As not every patient had a yearly follow-up in the transplant center, the serum samples could not be obtained every year for all patients in the study. Two patients were lost to follow-up at three and four years. A total of 1107 sera were tested for the presence of DSA. Testing of at least 5 sera per patient was mandatory, 4 in the first year including the pre-transplant sample and at least 1 serum thereafter. On average, eight serum samples per patient were examined. Collectio n, storage and use of tissue and patient data have been performed in agreement with the Code for \"Proper Secondary Use of Human Tissue\", put forward by \"The Federation of Dutch medical scientific societies\" (www. Federa.org), therefore no IRB approval is needed. Table 4.1 Patient, donor and transplant characteristics (n=140). Parameter Recipient age, years* 51 (16-76) Male gender 53/87 Cold ischemia time, hours** 22.4 Data are given as numbers or in case of * as median (range), ** mean Immunosuppression The immunosuppressive regimen at the time of transplantation was prednisone (PRED) in combination with a calcineurine inhibitor (C NI) in all recipients: cyclosporine (CSA) in 60, and tacrolimus (TAC) in 80 recipients. In addition to CSA and PRED, azathioprine (AZA) was added in 15 recipients. Addition al immunosuppression to TAC and PRED, was AZA in 5 recipients and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in 26 recipients. None of HLA class II DSA persisting or appearing >1 yr after Tx are related to graft loss 65 the recipients received induction therapy at the time of transplantation. CSA levels were determined in whole blood by Enzyme Monoclonal Immuno Test (EMIT, Dade Behring, Newark, DE, USA) or HPLC-MS/MS. In the first 3 months after transplantation, target CSA trough-levels for CSA+PRED treate d recipients CSA+PRED+AZA treated recipients 0.10-0.15 mg/l. TAC trough-levels were measured in whole blood by lmx (Abbott) or HPLC-MS/MS , target levels were 15-20 immunosuppressive regimen one year after tr ansplantation was CNI-based in all but one recipient who received MMF in combination with PRED.

Eighty-seven recipients received TAC, 48 recipients were on TAC monotherap y, 27 on TAC+PRED, 3 on TAC+PRED+AZA, 2 on TAC+PRED+MMF, and 7 on TAC+MMF. The immunosuppressive regimen was solely based on pre-transplant immunological status (PRA and HLA match) and post- transplant clinical course (acute rejectio ns) and not on HLA antibody screening post- transplant. Clinical outcome parameters Acute rejection was defined as any rejection treatment within 3 months after grafting. Rejection episodes were proven by needle core biopsy. Rejection treatment consisted of three doses of methylprednisolone (0.5-1 .0 g/dose). For steroi d-resistant rejections, second line therapy consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Delayed graft function (DGF) was defined as the need for renal replacement therapy in the first week after transplantation. Graft failure was defined as return to dialysis and was censored for recipient death with functioning graft. Center policy of tissue typing All patients and donors were typed at the time of transplant for HLA class I (HLA-A and -B) by serology and for HLA class II (H LA-DR and -DQ) by molecular methods (PCR-SSP). Donor typing for Cw and DP was not performed and DSA against these specificities were not included. All transpla nts were performed under the auspices of Eurotransplant and were ABO compatible. Crossmatches before transplantation were the standard NIH crossmatch with and without dithiothreitol (DTT), and the Crossmatch-sera us ed were the pre-transplant serum drawn at the time of transplantation and all releva nt positive historical samples (peak sera). A negative class I CDC crossmatch was mandat ory for transplantation. Pre-transplant CDC-screening was performed with and with out DTT and included a selected 60-cell panel, in which most common HLA specific ities were included. Reading was performed using a Leitz Patimed automated microscope and positivity was defined as at least 10% of cell death in the patient serum over the negative controls. Of the 140 recipients in this cohort, 132 were non-immunized (CDC-PRA 0-5%) and 8 were immunized (CDC-66Chapter 4 PRA 6-85%). HLA class I and II antigens were considered unacceptable for a patient, if antibodies against the specificity had ever been demonstrated either at the time of transplantation or in the past. Mismatches from previous transplants were excluded, as were the paternally inherited antigens of children in female patients. Non- transfused male recipients and female recipients not immunized by pregnancy received at least one leukocyte-poor bl ood transfusion before transplantation according to the local transfusion protocol at that time14. Single antigen Bead Assay Patient sera were screened for HLA antibody at the Terasaki Foundation Laboratory using the HLA class I and class II Single antigen assay (LABScreen beads: LS1A04 and LS2A01, One Lambda Inc, beads detect HLA-A, -B, Cw, -DR, -DQ and -DP antibodies. All assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 20 \u00b5l of test serum was added to 5 \u00b5l of SA beads, incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at room temperature (RT), and then washed with the provided wash buffer. One hundred \u00b5l of goat anti-human IgG antibody conjugated with R-phycoerythrin(PE) was added to the beads, incubated for 30 minutes in the dark at RT, then washed and read on the LABScan 100 flow cytometer (One Lambda Inc., Canoga Park, CA). With every assay a negative control serum (One Lambda Inc, Canoga Park, CA) was run to determine the background due to non-specific binding. All beads with normalized median fluorescence inten sity value (i.e. raw MFI value of the test bead - MFI value of the negative control bead) >2000 were considered positive. This cut-off point was established based on the results from a previous study15. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS, Cary, NC). Graft survival was analyzed with the proportional hazards regression analysis (Cox regression) using stepwise forward selection and backward elimination techniques for a basic model including suspected patient, donor, transplant and clinical risk factors: \"age of recipient (years)\", \"gender recipient (male vs. female)\", \"type of CNI at the time of transplantation (TAC vs. CSA)\", \"type of CNI at year 1 after transplantation (TAC vs. CSA)\", \"PRED at year 1 after transplantation (yes vs. donation after rejection (no vs. yes) \", \"Delayed graft function (immediate graft function vs. delayed graf t function\". Results of DSA testing and interaction factors were then entered into the model that includ ed the statistically significant risk factors from the basic model. Non-parametric tests (Pearson chi-square, HLA class II DSA persisting or appearing >1 yr after Tx are related to graft loss 67 Kruskall-Wallis) were performed when indicate d, a P-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Results DSA prevalence A total of 1107 sera of 140 renal transplant recipients (all pre-transplant DSA negative) with at least one year graft function were retrospectively tested for DSA using the Luminex Single antigen assay. The number of sera per patient was 5 to 17 (median 8). Median time of follow-up post-transplant was 11.4 years (range 1.1-14.7). During the follow-up period, 38 recipients lost their graf t, 29 died with a functioning graft, and 73 continued to function. After transplantat ion DSA were shown in 35 out of the 140 recipients (25%). DSA were HLA class I in 11 recipients (5 A, 6 B) and class II in 20 (2 DR, 13 DQ, 5 DR+DQ). Four recipients had both class I and II (2 A+B+DQ, 1 A+DQ, 1 A+DR) (Table 4.2). DSA were detected in 83 out of 224 samples of the 35 positive recipients (mean per patient 6.4), none were shown at any time after transplantation in 883 samples of 105 negative re cipients (mean per patient 8.4). Time of DSA detection DSA were detected early -in the first year after transplantation-, or late -after the first year post-transplant (Table 4.2). Early DSA we re shown in 23 recipients (ID 1-23), in 16 for the first time at month 3 (70%), in three at month 6 (13%) and in four at year 1 post-transplant (17%). Nine had class I, 12 class II, and two both I and II. Late DSA was shown in 12 recipients (ID 24-35) between ye ar 2 and 10; two class I, 8 class II and two both I and II. From the early DSA group (n=23) six patients showed DSA positivity throughout the follow-up period (ID1-6), in four the antibodies disappeared and reappeared several years later (ID7-10). The remaining 13 patien ts presented with DSA in one or two sera and stayed negative thereafter (ID11-23). In the late DSA group 8 of 12 recipients had antibodies present throughout the follow-up period (ID 24-31), the remaining four showed antibody presence only in one or two sera and were negative thereafter (ID32-35). The DSA specificities in the positive patients were consistent. Wi th the exception of ID1, all patients maintained the locus specificitie s in all positive sera tested, as shown in Table 4.2. Only ID1, who presented with anti-DQ7 in all DSA-positive sera, showed the additional presence of A24 and B35 in one sample (month 6). 68Chapter 4 Table 4.2 DSA after transplantation in (yr)DSA against 1 + + + + + + + + 11,8 11,6 A, B, DQ 2 + + + + + + 9,1 8,8 DQ 3 + + + + 3,6 3,5 DQ 4 - + + + + + + + + + 14,5+ 14,5+ DQ 5 - + + + 2,1 1,3 DQ 6 - - + + * 7,8 DQ 7 + + + - - - - - - - - + + 13,2 12,9 DR 8 + - - - - + + + 13,5+ 13,5+ DQ 9 - + - + 13,5 12,9 DQ 10 - - + + - + + 11,5+ 11,5+ B 11 + - - - - - - - - * 10,3 DQ 12 + - - - - - - - 13,5+ 13,5+ A 13 + - - - - 13,5+ 13,5+ DQ 14 + - - - - * 9,4 B 15 + - - - 3,3 3,2 A 16 + - - - - - - - - 12,5+ 12,5+ B 17 + - - - - - - - - 12,5+ 12,5+ A, DQ 18 + + - - * 2,9 B 19 + + - - * 7,1 DQ 20 + + - - * 6,2 A 21 + + - - - - 10,5+ 10,5+ A 22 - - + - - - - - * 10,4 DQ 23 - - + - - 12,4 11,4 B 24 - - - + 3,8 1,6 DR, DQ 25 - - - + 3,1 0,3 A 26 - - - + 3,6 0,7 DR, DQ 27 - - - + + 4,2 1,1 A, DR 28 - - - + 4,8 0,1 A, B, DR, DQ 29 - - - - - + + + + + + 11,3 6 DQ 30 - - - - + 12+ 4+ DQ 31 - - - - - - + + 11,1 1 DR, DQ 32 - - - + - - - - 9,8 7,7 DQ 33 - - - - + - - * 6,8 B 34 - - - - - + - 11+ 6+ DR 35 - - - - - + + - - - 11+ 7+ DR, after failure; GS: graft survival censored for death, + functioning, * de ath with functioning graft HLA class II DSA persisting or appearing >1 yr after Tx are related to graft loss 69 Transient DSA A group of 17 recipients developed DSA for a short period of time but the antibodies disappeared and were not detected again during the follow up period. The time during which the DSA were present varied between 3 months and 2 years. These so-called \"transient\" DSA were seen both in the earl y (n=13, ID11-23), and late (n=4, ID32-35) group. Transient early DSA was class I in 8, II in 4 and both in one recipient, transient late was class I in one and II in 3 patients. Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) valu es obtained when testing transient DSA ranged from 2000-11500 MFI, with a median value of 3000 MFI. There was no difference between DSA class I (median 2750, range 2000-11500) and class II (median 3000, range 2000-7000) . In contrast median MFI value in persistent positive patients was 12000 (range 2000-24000), while MFI values for DSA class II were considerably higher (median 14000, range 2000-24000) than those for class I (median 2400, range 2000-15500) (P=0.01). Clinical outcome From the 140 patients included in the study, 38 lost th eir graft function during the follow-up period; they were re-transplanted or returned to renal replacement therapy. Overall actuarial graft survival at the e nd of the follow-up period was 72.9%. Of the 38 recipients who lost their graft, 16 (42%) were DSA-positive, compared to 19 (18%) in 102 recipients who died with function ing graft or are still functioning (X2=8.39, P=0.004). The grafts of the persistent positiv e patients had function ed in the presence of DSA from 1.3-13.5 years. From the DSA positive patients (n=35), 17 grafts (49%) failed, whereas failed (X2=10.84, P=0.001). To test for donor-, recipient-, and transplant risk factors involved in death censored graft loss, multivariate analysis by Cox regression analysis was performed. First we analyzed a basic model without the inclusion of the DSA result. From the risk factors tested for in the basic model, delayed graft function (DGF) was the only significant one contributing to graft survival (Table 4.3). All other factors tested had a P- value from 0.14-0.99: CIT P=0.99, HLA mm B P=0.96, age recipient P=0.95, donor type (living vs. heart-beating (HB) vs. donation after cardiac death (DCB)) P=0.93, CDC immunization (non-sensitized IS year one age donor P=0.68, IS CNI at year one P=0.58, HLA mm DQ P=0.50, HLA mm A (0 mm vs. >=1) P=0.50, IS CNI at time of transplant (TAC vs. CSA) p=0.47, acute rejection (no vs. yes) P=0.40, first P=0.22, serum Subse quently DSA positivity was introduced as risk factor to the model. DSA class II posit ivity persisting or appearing after year 1 significantly improved the model that predicts long-term graft survival. Recipients with 70Chapter 4 class II DSA after the first year post-transplan t are 3.2 times (CI 1.68-6.46) more at risk for graft failure, even when taking into account DGF, the other factor that influenced graft survival. DGF and DSA class II positivity were not associated (P=0.71). Class I DSA persistent or appearing after the first year post-transplant was a significant factor if introduced in the basic model (OR=3.31, CI 1.16-1.49, P=0.03), but did not remain significant in the multivaria te analysis when introduced together with DSA class II positivity. Actuarial 5-year graft survival (Kaplan Meier) in class II DSA positive recipients after year 1 (n=19) was 68% vs. 91 % in DSA negative recipients, 10-year graft survival was 57% vs. 80% (Figure 4.1).

Discussion This single center study analyzed the frequency and nature of HLA DSA after kidney transplantation. The presence of DSA was mo nitored from the time of transplantation up to 15 years thereafter. All patients were DSA negative before transplantation, had at least 1 year of renal function and an average of 8 serum samples was tested per patient. The class and specificity of the antibodies was determined by the Single antigen assay. We concentrated on \"de novo\" donor specific antibody formation, non- DSA were not included in the analysis. The inclusion of as many serum samples as possible in the study enabled us to detect changes in DSA if any, over the post- transplant years. The strength of the pres ent study is the screen ing for \"de novo\" DSA during a follow-up period of up to 15 years in a cohort of consecutive renal transplant recipients. DSA developed after transplantation in 25% of a consecutive series of kidney transplant recipients. The DSA were more of ten class II (60%) than class I, the with anti-DQ antibodies was remarkable. Only few patients had both classes of antibody (10%). From th e patients who lost their graft, 42% was DSA positive compared to 18% of the remainin g patients, showing that the presence of antibodies is associated with graft surviv al, but does not necessarily lead to an immediate deleterious effect on graft-functi on. The absence of graft-dysfunction in the presence of DSA is possibly the result of accommodation, a phenomenon mainly known from ABO incompatible transplants16. The DSA were detected in the majority of th e patients within one year after grafting (66%), the remaining appeared after the firs t year post-transplant at different time points during the follow-up period. From 18 persistent DSA positive patients, 13 lost their graft after having been DSA positive for 0.6 up to 13.5 years. In general DSA were persistent once detected, as was the specific ity of the antibodies detected. Only one patient (ID 1) showed next to the persistent DQ7 antibody in his serum samples, the additional presence of 2 class I donor specific antibodies in one sample, however the class I antibodies disappeared after 6 months. A distinct group of 17 patients presented with DSA during a short period of time only, thereafter the antibodies disappeared. We ca lled them patients with \"transient\" DSA. Patients with transient DSA were found both early (ID 11-23) and late (ID 32-35) after transplantation, the DSA were more often cl ass I than class II. Of the 17 transient DSA-positive recipients only three lost thei r graft during the follow-up period, patients with transient DSA seemed to have the same risk of graft failure as DSA negative recipients. Transient DSA could not be shown to have an effect on graft survival. To our knowledge transient antibodies have not been described previously in studies on chronic rejection, but studies as the present one with long-term follow-up of sera and patients, are rare. In the transient DSA pati ents no difference in graft survival was found between DSA class I and II, however the numbers in the analysis were small and the number of patients with DSA class II after year-1 is only 3. The strength of the antibodies detected in the Luminex Single antigen assay is expressed as MFI. When the MFI values for the persistent and transient DSA were compared, the transient DSA proved to have significantly lower MFI values. MFI values for transient DSA had a median value of 3000, compared to 12000 MFI for persistent DSA. For persistent DSA a difference was also shown between class I and II, median MFI for class I was 2400 and for class II 14 000. This is a puzzling finding, although class II DSA are found more often than cl ass I, the difference in MFI value is unexpected. The one patient (ID 1) who presented with persistent class II DSA and transient class I fitted the persistent/transient MFI profile. These findings again point to the fact that de fining the cut off point for positivity in the Single antigen assay is not easy. Where the blessing of the technique is the clear and HLA class II DSA persisting or appearing >1 yr after Tx are related to graft loss 73 sensitive determination of the distinct HLA antibody specificities, the question remains whether all the HLA antibodies whose pres ence is determined, are also clinically relevant. In a previous paper we already showed that DDA detected by SA and not by less sensitive methods may be related to acute rejection episodes, but are not detrimental to long-term graft outcome17 This is consistent with our findings in the analysis of 103 cytotoxic typing sera. All cytotoxic class I and II antibodies had MFI values >4000 in 99% of the class I and 92% of the class II sera (data not published). On the basis of these results, for our transplant center the decision was taken that only antibody in pre-transplant sera with an MFI value >4000, would be considered positive for clinical purposes. Although lower MFI values may represent harmful DSA in occasional patients, we believe this to be a small minority. DSA was strongly associated with graft surv ival (P=0.001) in univariate analysis. Risk factors reported to be associated with long-term graft survival were included in multivariate Cox regression analysis. DSA cla ss II positivity persistent or appearing after year 1 proved to be significantly associated with long-term graft survival. Recipients with class II DSA after the first year post-transplant are 3.2 times more at risk for graft failure, even when taking into account other factors that influence graft survival such as DGF. Class I DSA after the first year post-transplant were not an independent significant factor in the multivariate analysis in addition to class II DSA, nor were either class I or II when only present in the first year post-transplant. From our data it is not possible to conclude whether it is the specificity or the MFI value that is more related to a worse clinical course, because the higher MFI values are predominantly found for the class II DSA. Interesting are the nine patients, who were DSA class II positive both before and after year 1 post transplant. Although in five of them the MFI values of the positive sera in the first year post-transplant were 19.500-22.300, this was not correlated with an immediate clinical event at that time. On e patient still has a functioning graft after 15 years, one died with functioning graft after 8.8 years, while the others had graft failure at 3.6, 9.0, and 11.8 years. From the seven patients, who were positive only after the first year post-transplant, one st ill has a functioning graft after 15 year, while the other six had graft failure at 3.6, 3.8, 4.2, 4.8, 11.0 and 11.3 year. Although these are small numbers, the results are suggestive of worse graft survival for patients with persistent DSA class II appearing after year I. This is in contrast with the findings by Lee et al., that development of HLA antibodi es within the first year post-transplant markedly lowered allograft survival comp ared with later antibody development12. Actuarial 5-year graft survival (Kaplan-Meier) in class II DSA positive recipients after year 1 was 68% versus 91% in DSA negative recipients, 10-year graft 57% 80%. Actuarial 10-year graft surv ival for transient DSA positive (class I and class II) and DSA negative recipients was comparable (\u00b1 80%). 74Chapter 4 The role of class II antibodies in graft surv ival has been described before. Lachmann et al. tested patients with a minimum of 6 mont hs stable kidney function, at a median of 5 years post-transplant for the presence of DSA in one serum sample. The patients were antibody negative by CDC and ELISA at the time of transplant. DSA were mainly against HLA class II antigens, especially HLA- DQ. They concluded that class II DSA, even when produced late after transplantation, are detrimental to graft outcome18, which is in accordance with our present findings. Campos et al. studied recipients with a minimum of 3 years stable kidney function on ce for the presence of HLA antibodies at a median 4.4 years post-transplant19. The presence of HLA class II antibodies was a risk factor for graft loss even before a decline in renal function was shown; the detection technique however was ELISA. Hidalgo et al. tested for DSA in sera drawn at the time of clinically indicated biopsi e s ( 7 d a y s - 3 1 y e a r s ) . D e n o v o D S A a t t h e t i m e o f a l a t e biopsy is primarily against class II, and is associated with histopathological changes in the biopsy and subsequent graft failure13. Gill et al. tested for DSA using FlowPRA in th e first year post-transplant. No difference in graft loss could be shown between re cipients with and without de novo HLA antibodies during the first year post -transplant. These findings support our analysis that DSA, developed in the first ye ar post-transplantation and not persisting after the first year, have no effect on graft loss20. In a recent case-controlled study, Lee et al . looked at DSA and no n-DSA in a selected patient group. Antibodies developed within th e first year after transplantation resulted in graft failure after a mean of 5 years, while 80% of the recipients who developed HLA antibodies after one year had a graft su rvival of 10 years. Their conclusion that HLA antibody development within the first year post-transplant decreases graft survival, compared to later antibody develo pment, was not supported by our findings. However, this study differs essentially from the one described here, because the patients were selected and patients with pre-transplant DSA were included12. In conclusion, our study shows that post -transplant DSA is detected in 25% of recipients, slightly more class II than I. DSA presence is associated with graft survival, but does not necessarily lead to an immediat e loss of graft function. Only class II DSA, persistent or appearing more than one year af ter transplantation, tu rned out to result in worse clinical outcome. Patients with DS A had a functioning graft in the presence of DSA for 1.3 to 13.5 years. Most of th e DSA found are persistent throughout the follow-up period, but in a number of patients the DSA are transient, characterized by lower MFI values than the persistent ones, a nd presence of transient DSA is not related to graft survival. HLA class II DSA persisting or appearing >1 yr after Tx are related to graft loss 75 References 1. Terasaki PI. Humoral theory of transplantation. Am J Transplant 2003;3:665-73. 2.

This study was designed to analyze antibody appearance and patient and graf t characteristics related to antibody formation in patients who lost their graft at differe nt time points after transplantation. Methods Pre- and post-transplant sera of 56 DDA negative first transplant patients were screened for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II DDA by the Luminex Single antigen assay (LSA). All patients were treated with calcineurine inhi bitor-based immunosuppression. Results Three of 56 patients proved DDA positive by LSA before transplantation. Eighty-one percent of the remaining 53 patients became DDA class I or II positive or both; 16% before and 84% after transplantectomy. Class I antibodies were produced in 84% and class II in 77% of the recipients. Based on time of transplantectomy, three groups were created as follows: less or equal to 1 month, 1 to 6 months and more than 6 months. The groups proved to be significantly different for HLA class II mismatch and acute rejection. All recipients in group 1 to 6 months proved to be DD A positive. Logistic regression analysis showed that DDA positivity for class I was related to higher donor age and donor type (non-heart-beating), class II to higher donor age and class II mismatch. Conclusions Donor-directed HLA antibodies after tr ansplantation were demonstrated in 81% of first transplant recipients, all of whom were DDA negative by LSA before transpla ntation. The majority of the antibodies were found after transplantectomy. These findings may have to be take n into consideration in the allocation of organs of marginal donors such as olde r or non-heart-beating kidneys. Donor-directed HLA antibodies before and after transplantectomy detected by the LSA 79 Introduction Donor-directed human leukocyte (HLA) antibodies (DDA) newly formed after transplantation have been shown to result in poor graft outcome1-4. HLA antibodies have been demonstrated even before transplant rejection5,6. The results of these studies led to the suggestion that demonstr able HLA antibodies in recipients after transplantation are predictive of graft outcom e and present a useful tool in monitoring of graft function. DDA detected by Luminex bead-based assays were demonstrated in post-transplant sera and also on transplant eluates7-10. DDA fixed to the transplant can lead to a possible underestimation of HLA antibodies in post-transplant sera of recipients with their graft in situ. The high number of recipi ents that remained antibody negative after transplantation, but turned positive after transplantectomy, aros e our interest. We wondered whether in addition to post-transplant events, also patient and graft characteristics might be related to DDA po sitivity. The results on patients with a transplantectomy within 1 month after grafting were reported previously11. In contrast to many reports in the literature, we have not been able to demonstrate HLA antibodies before graft failure in ea rlier studies using conventional screening methods. The present study wa s designed with the hypothe sis that antibodies before transplant failure would be detectable when using more adva nced and sensitive methods. At present, the most sensitive an tibody screening technique is the Luminex Single antigen assay (LSA). Only patients with no DDA before their first transplantation were included. Production of DDA, time of appearance, and antibody class were analyzed. Antibody production was correlated with matching grade, donor and patient characteristics. Materials and Methods Patients From 541 patients transplanted with a fi rst kidney graft between January 1992 and January 2005 at the University Hospital of M aastricht, 483 were HLA antibody negative in complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and ELISA before transplantation. Ninety- six of them underwent transplantectomy befo re 2005. When tested by flow cytometric (FC) screening, another 27 proved HLA antibody positive before transplantation. From 13 recipients no serum samples were availabl e. Therefore 56 patients were included in the study. They were analyzed taking into account the time of transplantectomy and divided into groups I (transplantectomy <1 month), II (1-6 months) and III (>6 months). 80Chapter 5 Pretransplant patient characteristics are gi ven in Table 5.1.

Immunosuppression The immunosuppressive regimen was calcineuri ne inhibitor-based in all recipients; tacrolimus (TAC) in 38 recipients and cyclosporine A (CsA) in 18. Additional immunosuppression to TAC was prednisone 34, myco in one and (RAPA) in nine patients. In addition to CsA, PRED was added in 18 and azathioprine in two recipients. CsA levels were determined in whole blood by enzyme monoclonal immuno test (Dade Behring, Newark, DE) or high performance liquid chromotography-MS/MS. In the first 3 months after transplantation, target CsA trough-levels for CsA+PRED treated recipients were 0.15 to 0.20 mg/l and for CsA+PRED+azathioprine-treated recipients 0.10 to 0.15 mg/l. TAC trough levels were measured in whole blood by Imx (Abbott, Abott Park, IL) or high performance liquid chromotography-MS/MS, target levels were 15 to 20 ng/ml for weeks 1 and 2, 10 to 15 ng/ml for weeks 3 and 4, thereafter tapering to 5 to 7 ng/ml. Immunosupression was ce ssated after removal of the graft. Clinical Outcome Parameters A biopsy was taken during surgery 1 hr after reperfusion for every transplant. Rejection was defined as any rejection treatment within 3 months after grafting and was proven by needle core biopsy. Tr eatment consisted of three doses of methylprednisolone (0.5 to 1.0 g/dose) in 15 patients, two of which received additional doses of antithymocyte globulin. Sixteen of 56 recipients received rejection treatment or had a positive rejection histology in the explanted graft according to the Banff criteria. Because of the retrospective nature of the study, no material for C4d staining was available. Donor-directed HLA antibodies before and after transplantectomy detected by the LSA 81 Serum Collection Non-transfused patients received one leukocyte-poor protocollary blood transfusion before being placed on the transplant wait ing list. After transplantation, sera were drawn weekly during hospitalization, monthly in the first half year, and yearly thereafter. After transplantectomy, sera were collected at week 0, 2, 4 and 6 and at month 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Sera were stored at -30\u00b0C and centrifugated for 10 min at 10.000g prior to testing. Per patient, the pre-transplant serum, a post-transplant but pre-transplantectomy serum, and two post-transplantectomy sera drawn at week 6 and at months 2 to 6 were analyzed. HLA Antibody Analysis by Luminex Single antigen assay Specificity of HLA class I and II IgG antibodi es in recipient sera was determined using the LABScreen SA assay (One Lambda, Canoga Park, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microbeads coated with purified HLA were incubated with patient serum for 30 min. After washing to remove unbound antibody, the beads were incubated for 30 min with anti-human IgG-conjugated phyco-erythrine. All incubations were performed on a gently rotating platform in the dark at room temperature. The LABScan 100 flow analyser (Luminex, Aust in, TX) and HLA-Visual software (One Lambda) were used for data acquisition a nd analysis. All beads with a normalized median fluorescence intensity (MFI) value (i.e., raw MFI value of the test bead - MFI value of the negative control bead) more than 2000 were defined as positive. This cutoff point was chosen because MFI more th an 2000 is associated with a positive FC crossmatch9,12. Crossmatches Before transplantation three complement-dependent crossmatches were performed: the standard NIH crossmatch, standard NIH with dithiothreitol to reduce IgM antibodies, and a two-color fluorescence crossmatch. Sera used for the final crossmatches were the pretransplant serum drawn at the time of transplantation, the last serum tested for anti-HLA antibodies in the quarterly screening and all relevant positive historical samples. A negative class I dithiothreitol crossmatch was mandatory for transplantation. Center Policy of Tissue Typing During the investigation period the patients and donors were typed for HLA-A, -B, -DR and -DQ by serology and polymerase chai n reaction-sequence-specific primers. HLA antigens were considered unacceptable for a patient if antibodies against the specificity had ever been demonstrated, either at the time of transplantation or in the past. Mismatches from previous transplant s were excluded, as were the paternally 82Chapter 5 inherited antigens of children of female patients. All transplants were performed under the auspices of Eurotransplant, whic h means that only HLA-A, -B and -DR matches were included in th e allocation algorithm. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS, version 15.0 for Windows). Nonparametric tests were performed when indicated. A P-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significa nt. The suspected risk factors for total HLA antibody positivity and for HLA class I and class II positivity separately, that were tested as independent variables in stepw ise backward logistic regression were as follows: 'mismatch HLA class I (0 vs. 1)', 'mismatch HLA class II (0 vs. 1 vs. 2)', 'recipient gender (male vs. female)', 'donor ag e (years)', 'recipient age (years)', 'acute rejection within 3 months (0 vs. 1)', 'donor type (living vs. postmortal)', for 'postmortal (group I-II- III)'. P-value for removal in the model of the possible independent variables was set at P=0.05. All interaction factors were introd uced separately into the final model. Results Transplantectomy was performed in 56 first kidney graft recipients, who were all HLA antibody negative before transplantation based on screening by CDC, ELISA and flow cytometry. Their sera were now analyzed with LSA. Three of 56 recipients proved to possess DDA in their pretransplant serum; one patient was class I and two patients were class II DDA positive. They were excluded from further analysis. The patient characteristics of the remaining 53 recipients are given in Table 5.1. Non-DDA specificities were demonstrated in the pretransplant sera of 20 of 53 recipients (38%). They were directed agai nst class I in 55%, cla ss II in 5%, and both class I+II in 40% of the recipients. Specificit ies of non-DDA in pretransplant sera could be explained by transfusions and pregna ncies. Possession of non-DDA was not an indication for exclusion from the analysis. After transplantation, non-DDA were demonstrated in 46 of 53 recipients (87%), class I in 65%, class II in 11%, and class I+II in 24% of the recipients. After transplantation, 10 of 53 recipients (19%) stayed DDA negative after transplantation and transplantectomy. DDA positivity was demonstrated in 43 recipients (81%) (Table 5.2). Seven of 43 recipients (16%) showed DDA before transplantectomy (two class I and five cla ss II), whereas in 36 (84%) they appeared thereafter. After transplantectomy, 37% of th e patients turned positive in the 6-week serum, whereas 100% were found positive in the 2 to 6 month serum. Donor-directed HLA antibodies before and after transplantectomy detected by the LSA 83 Table 5.2 Post-transplant DDA in patients who underwent transplantectomy.

DDA antibodies directed against class I were detected in 23% of the recipients, against class II in 16% , and against both class I and II in 61% of the positive recipients. DDA after transplantec tomy were directed against class I, II, and I+II in 25%, 14%, and 61%, respectively. Th e specificities of the DDA are shown in Table 5.3. DDA and rejection Of the 16 recipients diagnosed with acute rejection, 15 (94%) had post-transplant DDA versus 28 of (P=0.12). In rejectors, DDA were detected before transplantectomy in four and in 11 thereafter. Three non-rejectors had DDA before and 25 after transplantectomy. This difference in DDA detection before and after transplantectomy was again not statistically signi ficant (P=0.09). The antibody class of the DDA detected in rejectors and non-rejectors is explained in Table 5.4. In rejectors, a higher incidence of combined class I+II DDA was found (P=0.16). Time of transplantectomy Time of transplantectomy ranged from 1 day to more than 10 years after transplantation. Differences in demographic and clinical parameters depending on time of transplantectomy were explored by means of non-parametric statistical tests. Patients were divided into 3 groups: I transplantectomy less than 1 month (n=23), II 1 to 6 months (n=13) and III more than 6 months (n=17). The patient characteristics are given in Table 5.1. Group II proved to be significantly different for HLA class II mismatch (P=0.02) and occurrence of acute rejection (P<0.001). There was a trend towards a difference in the number of non-heart-beating (NHB) donors (P=0.07). The number of patients becoming DDA positive in group I was 78%, in group II 100%, and in group III 71% (P=0.11) (Table 5.2). 84Chapter 5 Table 5.3 DDA positive recipients: HLA mismatch and DDA class I and II specificities.

Outcome parameters were total DDA (class I or II or both) positivity, DDA cl ass I positivity, and DDA class II positivity after transplantectomy. Outcome paramete rs tested for included the following: recipient age, recipient gender, donor age, donor type (living vs. cadaver), HLA class I or II mismatch, acute rejection within 3 months after transplantation, time of transplantectomy group I-II-III, and immunosuppressive regimen (TAC vs. CSA). With total DDA positivity as outcome paramete r, the only risk factor included in the final model (P=0.008, 2=9.76, df=1, r2=0.27) was donor age (year) (Odds ratio=1.053, P=0.008). This can be interpreted as foll ows: each 1 year increase in donor age increases the risk of DDA positivity with 5.3%. The positive and negative predictive values of the model are 70%. With class I DDA positivity as outcome paramete r, the risk factors included in the final model (P<0.0001, 2=23.05, df=3, r2=0.48) were donor age donor type (NHB) (Odds ratio=32.080, P<0.0001). This means that each 1 year increase in donor age increases the risk of DDA positivity with 6.0% and patients receiving a kidney from a non-heart-beating donor are 32 times more at risk for DDA positivity than patients receiving a ki dney from a heart-beating donor. With class II DDA positivity as outcome parame ter, risk factors included in the final model (P=0.003, 2=13.91, df=3, r2=0.31) were donor age (year) (Odds ratio=1.039, P=0.03), HLA mismatch class II (0-1 vs. 2) (Odds ratio=5.307, P=0.01). Thus each 1 year increase in donor age increases the risk of DDA positivity with 3.9% and patients receiving a kidney with two or more HLA cl ass II mismatches are 5 times more at risk for DDA positivity than patients receiving a kidney with less than two HLA class II mismatches. The positive and negative predictive values of the models are given in Table 5.5. 86Chapter 5 Table 5.5 Logistic regression with total DDA, DDA class I or II positivity after transplantectomy as variablea. Independent variable Cl positivity Donor age (yr) 1.039 (1.00-1.08) 1 0.03 HLA mismatch class II ( 2) 5.307 (1.35-20.81) 1 0.01 a Multivariate backward regression analysis with suspec ted risk factors: recipient gender (M/F), recipient age (years), donor age (years), HLA class I mismatch (0 vs. 1), HLA class II mismatch (0 vs. 1 vs. 2), donor type (living vs. hb vs. nhb), tect-group (I-II-III), HLA antibody specificities has become much more accurate by the use of increasingly sensitive antibody screenin g methods. After CDC and ELISA, flow cytometry proved to be the more sensitive method, equalled now by the Luminex bead-based assays12, particularly the Single antigen bead assay. Although the clinical relevance of DDA detected by LSA is not yet clear13, the pressure on laboratories to use it for clinical purposes and data presenta tion is growing. Testing by LSA screening demonstrated de novo DDA after transplantation in 81% of first transplant recipients, who were all DDA negative by LSA before transplantation. Antibodies were detected before transplantectomy in only 13% of the recipients; the majority was detected after transplantectomy. These findings are in contrast with severa l reports in the literature, where HLA antibodies have been shown to be associated with acute and chronic rejection2,14 and poor graft survival15. The results of these studies led to the hypothesis that detection of HLA antibodies in patients after transplantation was a useful early predictor of graft outcome16. The present findings could not confirm this view, which might be due to the selection of the patient group (transplantectomy of first graft patients only), the pretransplant antibody status of the recipients (DDA negative before transplantation by LSA) and the immunosuppressive protocol (calcineurine inhibitor-based). From 16 patients with reje ction, 11 turned an tibody-positive only after transplantectomy. Because only LSA DDA negative first transplant recipients were studied, the appearance of DD A is considered to be related to the renal transplant. DDA after transplantectomy were directed agai nst HLA class I+II in 61%, class I only in 25%, and class II only in 14% of the recipients. The majority of the recipients showed the presence of combined class I and II antibodies. The subdivision in antibody class Donor-directed HLA antibodies before and after transplantectomy detected by the LSA 87 differed considerably between different st udies; 32%, 21%, and 47% were found in a study of chronic rejection, which was performed using flow cytometric and Luminex methods17. In 2 studies using Elisa for HLA antibody detection, 22%, 61%, and 17%5 and 20%, 38%, and 43%18 were found, respectively . The inclusion criter ia for the patients were different in the papers mentioned. Of the DDA positive recipients, 98% also showed non-DDA. Non-DDA in 38%, demonstrated non-DDA only post-transplant. Of the recipients with non-DDA antibodies, 10 were female with a history of pregnancy. Two female recipients, who had been pregnant, showed the presence of non-DDA class I without specific DDA class I antibodies. Both women were proven DDA-negative after transplantation by LSA, the non-DDA were directed against a paternally inherited antigen from their children. Because these antigens were excluded in the kidney donor, this shows that antibody production against paternal antigens can be (re-) stimulated by a nonspecific stimulus19,20. For class II, the same phenomenon was observed in one female recipient. In two male recipients, the non-DDA were directed against antigens from a prev ious blood transfusion. Mao et al. reported that 77% of recipients with failed allografts had both DDA and non- DDA in their serum21. They concluded that the majority of these non-DDA antibodies were directed against \"donor-specific epitopes\". The immunogenicity of a kidney graft is related to differences in amino acid se quences of HLA molecules between donor and recipient, these differences or \"epitopes\" are considered to be the basic units of immunogenicity22. In the study of Piazza et al.23, only 9% of recipients developed class I alloantibodies with specificity restricted to the mismatched HLA class I antigens of the graft, in 90% of their study population a br oad HLA sensitization wa s found, supporting the idea that non-DDA are elicited together with DDA in response to a donor-specific epitope. The DDA appeared after transplantectomy in 84% of the positive recipients within 6 months, 37% was demonstrable at 6 weeks. Antibody detection after approximately 4 months was previously described for patients transplantectomised within 1 month after grafting11. In the present group of recipients with a median time of transplantectomy of 50 days (range 2-3619), the findings were similar. Removal of the kidney transplant itself, probably in comb ination with cessation of immunosuppression after transplantectomy, is the probable event leading to an tibody detection24. Recipients were divided into three groups according to the time of transplantectomy; within 1 month after grafting, between 1 and 6 months, and after more than 6 months. The first group predominantly consists of tec hnical failures and primary nonfunction, in the second acute rejection is the major re ason for graft loss and in the third the number of acute rejections is comparable to the overall transplant group and graft loss, is mainly due to chronic allograft neph ropathy. When the characteristics of the 88Chapter 5 groups are compared, HLA-DR mismatch and acute rejection episodes proved significantly different between the groups. The highest numbers of acute rejections and NHB donors were found in patients with early graft failure (groups I and II) and as a result early transplantectomy (less than 6 months after transplantation). In recent years, more NHB donors are transplanted in the Netherlands. Recipients of NHB donors experience more primary non-function, more rejection, and more early failures25-27. The number of class II mismatches is highest in patients with transplantectomy less than 6 months (groups I and II). It is well known that class II mismatches are associated with a worse graft survival28. The number of patients that turn DDA positive for HLA is also the highest in group II. In an attempt to determine which factors play a role in the formation of HLA class I or II antibodies, we performed backward regre ssion analysis. For total DDA positivity, an increase in donor age was related to an incr ease in DDA positivity. A higher donor age related to DDA positivity has also been shown for a group of recipients with transplantectomy within 1 month, as reported previously11. Several studies have reported on the relation between higher donor age and increase in immunogenicity29,30. A mechanism called the \"injur y response\" was suggested as explanation by Halloran et al.31. Factors related to DDA positivity could be diff erent for class I and class II positivity and actual relationships might be obscured by the above analysis. Therefore the analysis was repeated for DDA class I positivity an d DDA class II positivity separately. For DDA class I positivity, donor type and dono r age were statistically significant in the final model. Particularly, recipients of NHB donor grafts had a high risk for DDA positivity. The effect is most probably mu ltifactorial, NHB grafts have a longer first warm ischemic time, and up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex and shedding of antigen might be higher in those grafts, that often show primary nonfunction. But care should be taken in drawing firm conclusions from groups with small numbers, e.g. the NHB donors were older and were transplanted into older recipients. No significant diff erences in DDA positivity were noticed between recipients of a heart-beating and NHB graft, who failed within 6 months. Because only very few patients without class I mismatches were in cluded, the factor 'HLA class I mismatch' could not be analyzed. Others investigators, however, did find such a relationship with class I positivity32. For class II positivity, the related independent factors were donorage (year) and class II mismatches (DR and DQ). In an Italian study2, no such correlation between DR mismatch and class II positivity was ev idenced. The relation between class II mismatches and DDA class II positivity might be due to the fact that in our study, besides HLA-DR also DQ mismatches were in cluded. It has been reported that HLA-DQ, Donor-directed HLA antibodies before and after transplantectomy detected by the LSA 89 rather than HLA-DR, is targeted by the allo antibody response, pr oving the importance of HLA-DQ antibodies28,33. For DDA class II positivity, matching for class II antigens might be of importance especially in high risk transplants, for example, from older donors and NHB grafts, as they have a higher failure rate. In conclusion our hypothesis that antibodies before transplant failure, which we were unable to demonstrate in earlier studies, would be detectable when using more advanced and more sensitive methods, proved not to be valid. De novo DDA HLA antibodies after transplantation were demonstrated in 81% of first transplant recipients, who were all DDA negative by LS A before transplantation. Antibodies were detected before transplantectomy in only 16% of the recipients; most of them were detected thereafter. The frequency of class I and II antibodies was approximately the same; the majority of the antibodies were found combined. NHB donortype and higher donor age is related to DDA class I positivit y, whereas worse class II match and higher donor age are related to antibody class II positivity. These findings may have to be taken into consideration in the allocation of organs of marginal donors, such as older or non-heart-beating kidneys . 90Chapter 5 References 1.

This study analyses the incidence of HLA-DP antibodies in renal patients. Development and epitope specificity of donor-specific antibodi es (DSA) and non-DSA (NDSA) were examined. sera of 338 patients were sc reened for HLA-DP antibodies using the Luminex Single antigen assay. Positive patients, pa rtners and/or kidney donors were HLA-DP typed by sequence specific oligonucleotides. Potential epitopes were mapped by comparing the amino acid of HLA-DP hypervariable regions (HVR) A-F of and/or Specific ities in the sera were aligned to deduce the HVR motif responsible for the antibodies. HLA-DP antibodies were detected in 14% of the pati ents (48/338). Before transplantation the antibodies were shown in 23% (10 females and 1 male) and 77% we re found after transplantation (30 in patients after the first, 7 after the second graft.) Specificities were never restricted to indi vidual mismatched antigens; broad HLA-DP sensitization was found as a rule. A single HVR mismatch was present in 80% of the DSA and in 79% of the NDSA. No HLA-DPA specific antibodies were found. Our findings confirm that HLA-DP anti bodies are specific for epitopes sh ared by different HLA-DP antigens, indicating that only a restricted number of mismatch ed epitopes are recognized by the recipients immune system . Matching for immunogenic HLA-DP epitopes for rena l transplantation seems to be functionally more relevant than classical matching at the allelic level. HLA-DP antibodies before an d after renal transplantation 95 Introduction Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DP is an HL A class II locus identified more than 30 years ago as a possible stimulator of th e mixed lymphocyte culture response in previously primed cells. It was originally named the SB locus but was renamed DP after the 1984 workshop1. DPB1 and DPA1 are the MHC genes encoding the DP molecule. HLA-DP antigens were initially typed by cell ular methods, the prevalence of antibodies against HLA-DP antigens was shown later2,3. At present 132 HLA-DP alleles are described using DNA-based typing methods, mostly sequence-based typing (SBT)4,5. The polymorphism of HLA-DP is largely in six hypervariable regions (HVRs), A-F, in exon 2 of the DPB1 gene. Most DP antigens are characterized by specific combinations of amino acid sequences (mot ifs) of these six HVRs. HLA-DPA is also polymorphic with 27 known alleles at present. They are divided in 4 groups: DPA1*01-*04. The DPA polymorphism is re stricted and involves less amino acids sequences than that of DPB. HLA-DP antigens expressed on peripheral blood cells and also on endothelial cells especially during rejection episodes are supposed to present a target for the humoral immune response in kidney transplantation6-8. Population analyses showed that HLA-DP mismatches between donor and reci pient did not influence the outcome of first kidney transplants, but did have an impact on retransplants9. Epitope-based matching rather than allele matching sh ould probably be the method of choice10. The contribution of HLA class II antibodies, especially HLA-DP, to graft rejection and graft loss has long been poorly understood, because testing for their detection on B-lymphocytes was hardly satisfactory. Wi th the introduction of the solid-phase antibody detection assays, in particular, the Luminex Single antigen (LSA) assay, where HLA-DP molecules are attached to microspheres, class II DP antibodies are now detected easily and their clinical relevance might be assessed more accurately11. This study was designed to analyze the inci dence of HLA-DP antibodies in renal patients before and after transplantation. Furthermore, the epitope specificity and the correlation between the development of donor-specific antibodies (DSA) and non-donor-specific antibodies (NDSA) were ex amined using LSA. HVRs of both patient and donor were determined by sequence spec ific oligonucleotides (SSO) to identify potential DSA epitopes. 96Chapter 6 Materials and Methods Patients and samples From January 2007 until January 2009, 338 re nal patients from the University Hospital of Maastricht were screened for the pres ence of HLA class II antibodies using the Luminex Single antigen assay (LSA). Of them, 133 are currently on the renal transplant waiting list, where 43 have never been transplanted and 90 are awaiting retransplantation. The remaining 205 were te sted in the local post-transplant protocol. All patients presenting with HLA-DP antibodi es were selected and investigated further. Their pre- and post-transplant sera were exam ined with LSA. Patient characteristics are given in Table 6.1.

Microbeads coated with puri fied HLA molecules we re incubated with HLA-DP antibodies before an d after renal transplantation 97 patient serum for 30 min. After washing to remove unbound antibody, the beads were incubated for 30 min with antihuman-IgG-con jugated phyco-erythrine. All incubations were performed on a gently rotating platform in the dark at room temperature. The LSA class II lot used contained 13 micro-be ads coated TX) and HLA-VISUAL software (One La mbda) were used for data acquisition and analysis. All beads with normalized median fluorescence intensity value (i.e. raw median fluorescence intensity (MFI) value of the test bead - MFI value of the negative control bead) >2000 were considered positive. The cut-off point was established based on the results from previous studies12. HLA-DP typing by luminex SSO assay DNA samples of patients with HLA-DP anti bodies (n=48), partners (n=8) and kidney donors (n=31) were typed for HLA-DP using LABType\u00aeSSO according to the manufacturer's instructions. For two patients, no DNA from the partner was available and for six recipients DNA of the organ donor was lacking. DNA samples were isolated from either peripheral blood or spleen cells using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) and stored at -30\u00b0C. In short, 2 l of purified genomic DNA (concentration 20 ng/ l) is polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified using 4 l of group-specific primer, 0.2 l Taq polymerase (0.33U) and 13.8 l amplification mix. The primer has a biotin label, which allows the PCR product to be detected using R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (SAPE). After amplification, the PCR product is neutralized and allowed to rehybridize (15 min, 60\u00b0C) to a mixture of 43 complementary sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes conjugated to color-coded beads. The mixture is then washed three times and is incubated with 50 l of SAPE (1:50) for 5 min at 60\u00b0C. Excess SAPE is washed away. The LABScan 100 flow analyser (Luminex) identifies the fluorescent intensity of the PE on each microsphere. Th e assessment of the HLA-DP typing is based on the reaction pattern compared to patterns associated with published HLA-DP sequences. Twelve DNA samples previously typed for HLA-DP by the SBT method described previously13 were used to validate the SSO HLA-DP typing method, was to correctly identify the different polymorphic motifs of the six HVRs of exon 2 of all HLA-DP alleles present in the LSA class II lot used (Table 6.2). The results ob tained were identical to SBT, albeit SSO included ambiguous typing results. Among those, the correct typing was always present, for all samples the six HVR polymor phisms were correctly identified. In case 98Chapter 6 an ambiguous result was obtained for patient and partner/donor-HLA-DP typing, the allele most frequent in Caucasians was assigned14. Table 6.2 Hypervariable regions (A-F) of exon 2 of the HLA- DPB1 alleles present in the LSA class II assay. A B C D E Luminex Single antigen Donor specificity of HLA-DP antibodies Epitopes for possible antibody formation were mapped by comparing the HLA-DP HVR amino acid sequences of exon 2 of recipient, partner and/or donor, as defined by SSO typing. A potential mismatched epitope was defined as an amino acid sequence present in one of the six HVRs of partner or donor, but absent in the recipient. To verify the potential epitopes, LSA patterns were used (Table 6.2). The amino acid sequences of the HLA-DP-specificities reco gnized by the serum were aligned. They were compared in order to deduce the most likely mismatched HVR motif responsible for the antibodies. An example is given in Table 6.3. Results HLA-DP antibody incidence in renal patients Screening for HLA class II antibodies by LSA before and after transplantation was performed for 338 renal patients from the University hospital of Maastricht. Class II HLA-DP antibodies were detected in 48 (14%) of them. In 11 patients (23%), DP antibodies were detected before transplantation, 10 females and 1 male. In 37 of the positive patients (77%), the antibodies were shown after transplantation, in 30 HLA-DP antibodies before an d after renal transplantation 99 after the first and in 7 after the second graft (Table 6.1). In two patients, DP antibodies were the only ones demonstrable; HLA-DR and -DQ antibodies were present next to DP in 41 (Table 6.4). Additional class I an tibodies were shown in 45 patients.

HLA-DP typing by luminex SSO assay The amino acid sequences of the six HVRs of exon 2 of all HLA-DP alleles present in the LSA class II lot used (Table 6.2) were correc tly identified by SSO in all samples. An 100Chapter 6 ambiguous result in patient and partner/donor-HLA-DP typing wa s obtained in three individuals (ID7 DPB1*1601 and ID11 DPB1*3601) (Table antibodies All female patients positive for HLA-DP antibodies before transplantation had been pregnant. For two patients, the immunization partner was unknown and no children were available for typing. For the remaining eight patients, DNA of the partner was available for retrospective DP typing to id entify the potential epitopes to which the antibodies were directed. Two patients proved to be DP identical with their partner, the remaining six were mismatched for one or two DP alleles. Patient DP typing, allelic and HVR mismatches in Table 6.5. In 5/6 DP-mismatched patients, DSA were detected. Additional NDSA specificities directed against a single donor-specific HVR mismatch were detected in three patients and against two donor-specific HVR mismatches in one. In on e patient with four HVR mismatches, no clear motif could be detected. One patient had detectable NDSA only; her DP antibodies were the result of interlocus DRB1/DPB1 crossreactivity. The same held true for the DP antibodies of the two patients, who were DP identical to their partner. In the two females with unknown pregnancy immunization, two antibodies-causing motifs were identified. The only male pa tient, who presented with pretransplant DP antibodies, had received 66 transfusions with leukocyte-depleted blood. In his serum, class I antibodies were present bu t no additional class II DR/DQ antibodies were detected. No identification was po ssible for the antibody-causing motif. Post-transplant HLA-DP antibodies HLA-DP antibodies after transplantation were found in 37 recipients: in 30 after their first transplant and in 7 after the second. For 31 of them, donor-DNA was available for retrospective HLA-DP typing. Sixteen recipi ents were mismatched for two DP alleles with their donor, fifteen showed one allelic DP mismatch. Patient DP typing, allelic and HVR mismatches are given in Table 6.6. DSA were found in 26 recipients, NDSA were shown in all. DSA and NDSA were directed against a single donor-specific HVR in 19 patients, against 2 HVRs in 2 and against 3 HVRs in 1. The antibody-causin g motif was donor-specific in 25, and non-donor-specific in 4 recipients. For eight recipients, no clear motif could be identified.

Bold sign ifies donor-specific antibodies. HLA-DP antibodies before an d after renal transplantation 103 Frequency of antibody-target motifs A total of 47 antibody-target patterns were observed. The HVR-F (DEAV) motif was detected in 23 (49%) cases, 70% (n=33) the antibody-target motif was donor-specific. Discussion Anti-HLA-DP antibodies have always been difficult to identify by complement- dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In most instances, CDC panels were not routinely typed for HLA-DP, and if typing was performed, the specificity of the antibodies was difficult to establish because they were not directed towards a single DP antigen. Furthermore, DP antibodies were often masked by the presence of other class II antibodies. Recently, microbeads coated with purified HLA-DP molecules were added to the SA class II assay, both in flow cytometry and luminex, which allows more precise identification of HLA-DP antibodies. In the present study, renal patients were screened for HLA-DP antibodies using a panel HLA-DPB1 alleles have been describe d at present, the most frequent alleles in the Caucasian population are represented in this panel14. Because the polymorphism of HLA-DP is concentrated in six HVRs of ex on 2 of the HLA-DPB1 gene and almost all DP antigens can be described as combinations of several different motifs at each of these HVRs (Table 6.2), the panel used covered all the important and most frequent HVRs present in the Caucasian population. The polymorphic HVR motifs of exon 2 of HLA-DP not represented in the panel were: VDQL at position 8-11 (DPB1*7001), The LLEEE motif was present in two donors typed as DPB1*0601 (ID 7 and ID 11, Table 6.6). The VGPM motif was present in one patient typed as DPB1*2801 (ID 6, Table 6.5). The SSO assay for HLA-DP typing was validated for the alleles listed in Table 6.1. In 30% of the validation samples, the SSO result was the same as in SBT. In 70%, SSO resulted in ambiguous results, always including the correct SBT-DP typing. These results were because of polymorphisms outside the six HVRs, for which no DNA probes were available in the SSO assay. Nevertheless, all polymorphic motifs of the six HVRs of exon 2 could be correctly assigned using the SSO method. In on ly three cases we had to assign an allele that was not validated. Before the introduction of solid-phase techniques for HLA-DP antibodies detection, DP antibodies were studied using the monoclonal antibody immobilization of 104Chapter 6 leukocyte antigens described antibodies in 9.7% of pregnancy sera us ing MAILA and showed a high correlation of HLA-DP immunization together with reac tivity against HLA class I and II (DR/DQ) antibodies15. Using the same technique, Pfeiffer in 1995 found the overall incidence of HLA-DP antibodies in patients awaiti ng renal transplantation to Using flow- cytometric beads, Youngs reported that 12% of patients on their renal transplant waiting list possessed DP antibodies. In previously transpla nted patients, the percentage was even higher (45%)17. With the same technique, Qiu described an increased incidence of DP antibodies after graft rejection11. In the present study, we found 12% of renal patients to have DP antibodies, 23% before and 77% after transplantation. Although the HLA-DPA chain is also polymorphic and could potentially be the source of antibody reactivity, no HLA-DPA specific antibodies were found in this study. In a population of this size, one might expect to find DP antibodies reacting with DPA. The LSA class II kit used contained four beads carrying DPA*0103, eight beads coated with DPA1*0201 and one with DPA1*0401. To evaluate possible anti-DPA reactivity, DPA1 alleles have represented in diff erent combinations with DPB1 alleles, even if those are not commonly encoded on the same haplotype. DPA antibodies were suspected in sera where the DPB specificit ies remained undetermined, especially in three patients whose sera reacted with their own DPB1 alleles (Table 6.5 ID 3, ID 12 and ID 15); however, this was not confirmed by Single antigen analy sis. The role of the polymorphism of DPA1 in the intensity and specificity of antigen- antibody reactivity with the DP-heterodimer remains to be inve stigated further. DPA typing of patients, partners and donors was not performed because no DPA antibodies were shown. Because of the weak linkage d isequilibrium of HLA-DP with the classical HLA class I and II antigens18, even donor-recipient pairs identical for these loci have an 80% probability of being mismatched at DP19. However, because of the restricted DP polymorphism, many of these allelic mismatches will be comp atible for HVR motifs and, therefore, will not result in anti-DP formation. For most of the patients, the immunizing HLA-DP antigens and subsequent HVR mismatches could be determined. In 80% the DP antibodies were donor specific. None of the patients developed antibodies restricted to the mismatched DP antigens, and broad DP sensitization was found as a rule. This finding confirm previous observations that DP antibodies in sera of sensitized patients are specific for epitopes shared by different HLA antigens17,20,21. Even though many more potential HVR mismatches were present, almost all th e DSA (80%) and accomp anying NDSA mismatch: HVR-F in 16, HVR-C in 3, HVR-B in 2 and HVR-E in 1. This indicates that only a small number of mismatched epitopes are recognized by the recipients immune system and supports the immuno- HLA-DP antibodies before an d after renal transplantation 105 dominance of HVR-F and -C as also described by Duquesnoy GGPM (HVR-F) 69% of the DP antibodies were directed against the DEAV motif at that same position. In 21 patients homozygous for AAE/EAE (HVR-C) 48% of the DP antibodies were directed against the DED/DEE motif at that same position. These findings support the findings by Laux et al.10 that matching for immunogenic DPB1 epitopes was functionally more relevant than classical matching at the allelic level9,24. As first described by Bodmer et al.22,25, DR11 has the aminoacids D and E at positions 57 and 58 that correlate with the D and E in HVR-C (position 56-57) of 7 of the 13 HLA-DP 1401 and patients with strong anti-DR11 antibodies, the DP antibodies probably resulted from this inter-locus DR 11-DP epitope. In two patients, who were HLA-DP identical to their partner and had pretransplant DP antibodies, and in one patient with post-transplant DP antibodies, the DP antibodies were directed against the DED and DEE motif of HVR-C. In another patient with pretransplant DP antibodies, the specificities were explained by the DEE motif of HVR-C, because the patient possessed the DED motif herself. In another pa tient, the specificities were explained by the DED motif of HVR-C, while the pati ent himself carried the DEE motif. HLA-DP as well as HLA-DQ are up-regulated upon inflammation as shown earlier8. This might be the reason of the clinical relevance of anti-DP antibodies in re-transplants9. The contribution of anti-HLA-DP antibodies to kidney graft rejection and failure has long been an unresolved issue. With the introduction of the SA, the presence of HLA-DP antibodies can be de tected easily. Subsequently, it will become possible in the near future to assess their clinical releva nce more accurately. Meanwhile, some case reports have recently shown that DP antibodies represent a possible risk factor for transplant dysfunction and failure25-27. In summary, we have shown that HLA-DPB antibodies are found in patients before and after kidney transplantation. Before transp lantation, pregnancy is the most important stimulus for antibody production but also transfusions may result in DP antibody positivity. The majority of the DP antibodies, however, are found after transplantation, usually already after the first graft. No HLA- DPA specific antibodies were found in this study. The DP antibodies detected in sera of sensitized patients are specific for a number of epitopes shared by different HLA antigens. The majority of the DSA and accompanying NDSA found are directed against a single donor-specific HVR mismatch, which indicates that only a small number of mismatched epitopes are recognized by the recipients immune system. Our finding s confirm that matching for immunogenic HLA-DP epitopes seems to be functionally mo re relevant than classical matching at the allelic level, whether this is only true fo r retransplants remains to be established. 106Chapter 6 References 1.

Many laboratories rely on their specificity detection and use the information obtained for allocation of donor organs. A donor-specif ic crossmatch in the Luminex technique is for that reason desirable. A LumXm, in which the actual donor-HLA are coated onto specific capture beads, was tested for 88 pre- and post-transplant sera of 18 recipients. The results were compared with previously published flow cytometric crossmatch (FCXm) results for the same donor-recipient combinations. All sera were also examined by Luminex Single antigen (SA) tests. Class I LumXm detected 24 of 27 T-cell positive FCXm (89%) and class II 15 of 22 B-cell positive FCXm (68%). Sensitivity of LumXm for class I and II was 89% and 68% and specificity was 98% and 97%, respectively.

Luminex donor-specific crossmatches 111 Introduction Screening techniques of higher sensitivity than complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), like the bead-based assays, have in the past years1,2. these assays, color-coded microspheres coated with human leukocyte antigens (HLA) are used to identify HLA class I and II antibodies (ab) in patient sera. The tests detect both complement-binding and non-complement-binding HLA antibodi es using anti-human immunoglobulin G (IgG) as second antibody. More and more laboratories rely on the detection of specificities demonstrated by these type of assays and use the information obtained for allocation of donor organs3-6. Although the clinical relevance of antibodies detected by these bead-based techniques is still a matter of debate7-9, the availability of a prospective crossmatch in the Luminex technique is highly desirable. In the United States and United Kingdom, many laboratories are using flow cytometric cr ossmatches (FCXm) to make decisions on organ transplantation, although, in Eu rope many laboratories still rely on CDC crossmatches. In this report, we describe a Luminex donor-specific (DS) crossmatch (LumXm), in which the actual donor-HLA are coated onto specific capture beads. The results of the LumXm were compared to flow cytometric results for the same donor-recipient combinations obtained previously10. Materials and Methods Patients and sera From 18 patients transplanted at the Univ ersity Hospital of Maastricht between 1997 and 1999, 88 pre- and post-transplant sera were tested with the Luminex Xm technique. The Xm at the time of transplantation was the CDCXm with and without dithiotreitol (DTT), as required by the orga n exchange organisation. A negative class I CDCXm was mandatory for transplantation. All sera had been retrospectively tested by FCXm as described previously10. Patients and donors were typed for HLA-A/B by serology and for -DR/DQ by polymerase chain reaction primers Retrospectively, all recipient and donor typings (A,B,C,DR and DQ) have been repeated with molecular techniques (sequence-specific ol igonucleotide (SSO) hybridisation, Luminex) to ascertain the exact number of mismatches. If required high- resolution typing (DRB3, DQA1, DPB1) was performed. Patient sera were stored at -30oC and donor lymphocyte s were isolated from peripheral blood or spleen cells and stored in liquid nitrogen. 112Chapter 7 Luminex donor-specific consisting of microspheres coated with monoclonal antibodies against HLA class I or II, in the Luminex technology according to the manufacturer's protocol (Donor Specific Antibody Tepnel Lifecodes, Stamford, CT). Per serum, 2.2x106 donor 8 l of diluted (1:10) nonionic lymphocyte lysis buffer. The donor lysate was subsequently incubated for 30 min with 5 l of Xm beads to enable bind ing of the solubilized donor- HLA molecules onto the beads. The mixture was washed three times with 250 l wash buffer using a 96-well filter plate (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in conjunction with a vacuum manifold. Diluted recipient serum (1:4) was added and incubated for 30 min. After another three washes, 50 l antihuman IgG-conjugated phycoerythrine (anti-IgG- PE 1:10) was added and incubated for 30 min. All incubations were performed on a gently rotating platform in the dark at room temperature. After addition of 130 l of wash buffer, the LABScan100 flow cytometer (Luminex\u00a9, Austin, TX) was used for mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) measurement. Quality assurance In the Xm bead mixture, three negative control beads were included, whose mean MFI value was used as background signal. The test was considered failed if their mean MFI value was >500. A positive control bead (IgG) was included to check the binding of anti-IgG-PE, and the minimum requirement for the assay was MFI >10.000. In parallel with the patient sera, the coated Xm be ads were incubated with biotinylated monoclonal antibodies against HLA class I and II, the so-called lysate control. The lysate control was used to indicate correct attachment of donor-HLA on the beads. Instead of IgG-PE, streptavidine co njugated phycoerythrine (SAPE) is used as well as a positive control bead to check the SAPE. A minimum MFI value for both class I and II of the lysate control was set at 10.000, otherwise the test was considered failed. For the LABScan100 flow analyser, two calibration and two control bead mixtures were run prior to data acquisition. Data analysis Data generated with the LABScan100 were evaluated with the LifeMatch software (Tepnel Lifecodes) to obtain MFI values of capture- and control beads. To define positivity, the median of three negative co ntrols was subtracted from the MFI obtained for the testserum. The adjusted MFI values of class I and II Xm beads were compared with the adjusted MFI of the positive contro l bead. A ratio of >5% and/or MFI value of >1000 with a FACS Calibur system (Becton San Jose, CA) using logarithmic amplification on a 1024 channel resolution. The linear median value of FITC fluorescence was collected for CD3- and CD19- positive cells. A FCXm was considered positive if the ratio of median value of recipient serum to negative controlserum was >1.97 (mean+3 standard deviation) for T cells and >2.99 (mean+3 standard deviation) for B cells, provided that the ratio of the posit ive control serum to negative control was greater than the cut off value. External proficiency testing for FCXm was performed in the UK NEQAS scheme (60 Xm/year) and has always proven to be adequate. Antibody specificity analysis by single antigen (SA) assay Specificity analysis of the IgG anti-HLA class I (A, B and C) and II (DR, DQ and DP) ab of all recipient sera was performed using the LABScreen\u00ae SA assay (One Lambda\u00a9, Canoga Park, CA) according to the manufactur er's instructions. In short, microspheres coated with purified HLA antigens were in cubated with patient serum for 30 min. After washing to remove unbound antibody, antihuman-IgG-conjugated PE was added. The LABScan100 flow analyzer (Luminex) and HLAVisual software (One Lambda) were used for data acquisition and analysis. The reactivity of three strong allosera (panel reactive antibody (PRA)>90%) was determined with the class I and II Single antigen (SA) bead assay. For each bead, the positive control value was set at the mean of the three MFI values obtained. A positive bead reaction was subsequently defined as an MFI value of at least 10% of the positive control value for that bead. Statistical analysis Sensitivity was defined as TP/(TP+FN), specificity as TN/(TN+FP). Predictive values were calculated as positive predictive value = TP/(TP+FP) and negative predictive value=TN/(TN+FN) (True Positive (TP) =LumXm+/FCXm+, False Positive (FP)= 7 Results Luminex bead-based crossmatches were performed for 88 longitudinal pre- and post- transplantsera of 18 patients transplanted in Maastricht between 1997-1999. All sera had been crossmatched for T- and B-cells by FCXm as described previously10. A positive LumXm was found for class I in 25 sera, for cl ass II in 17. For 2 sera no reliable results were obtained, all other sera showed negative LumXm. LumXm versus FCXm Class I LumXm detected 24 of 27 T-cell positive FCXm (89%) and class II 15 of 22 B-cell positive FCXm (68%) (Table 7.1). LumXm MFI values showed time curves comparable to the curves obtained by FCXm ratios. In Figures 7.1 and 7.2, some examples of class I and II LumXms are shown.

Additional tests were performed to determine whether the LumXm test detected DQ or DP ab in selected sera without other class II ab. For HLA-DQ, five sera were selected without DR or DP ab, as proven by SA testing, specificities included were HLA-DQ2,4,5,7,8 and 9. The sera were tested against eight donor cells, carrying at least one of the relevant DQ specificities. All DQ LumXm failed to react with beads prepared from the selected donors (Table 7.2).

The results from both tests were compared. Class I results showed good correlation with FCXm results in 18 recipient-donor combinations, the LumXm was found to have approximately the same sensitivity and specificity as the FCXm (89%/95%). However, for class II, th e sensitivity was found to be 68%, with a specificity of 97%. Compared to the SA be ad assay, the sensitivity of the LumXm was 96% for class I and 65% for class II and the sp ecificity was 100% and 97%, respectively. Overall there were more discrepant results found in class II, mostly negative results where positive ones were expected. Negative LumXm for class I, discrepant with FCXm, was obtained in three recipients, two had non-DS ab and one had no HLA ab at all. In one discrepant positive LumXm, the presence of weak DS B51 ab was show n. FCXm seemed to provide false-positive Xm results, while LumXm was positive on ly when DS HLA ab were present. For class II, discrepant-negative LumXm were shown for three recipients, two proved to possess DS DQ and DP ab and one had non-DS DP ab. Two recipients had discrepant- positive LumXm, they were negative for HLA ab by the SA bead assay. Thus, LumXm missed DS ab in two recipients and was false positive in two others. In general, for class I, FCXm showed false- positive results, while for class II, more false-negative and positive results were noticed for LumXm. A closer look at the class II data suggested th at test results were obtained as expected when the target molecule was DR, which was the case in most of the donor-recipient combinations used. When, however, DQ or DP was the target, the LumXm was found negative. Additional LumXm tests with specific sera that contained solely DQ or DP ab (as determined by SA analysis of the sera) yi elded test results that were false negative. Five HLA-DQ-specific sera did not react in eight LumXm, with beads prepared from eight donors selected for the relevant DQ antigens (Table 7.2). In the same way, five HLA-DP-specific sera gave positive results in two LumXm, but failed to react with beads prepared from three donor cells bearing the corresponding DP antigens (Table 7.3). The two positive DP sera showed high MFI valu es in the SA bead assay, suggesting that the ab titer might play a role in the binding as fluorescence values in the SA bead assay are correlated with ab strength and titer9. Because all DQ and most of the DP sera did not show binding of the antibody to the be ad, DQ and DP antigens are most probably not captured by the LumXm beads. Another explanation could be that their molecular structure has changed in the binding proc ess, thus preventing antibody binding. Discrepancies in the results of Luminex Xm be ads and results of SA testing may also be because of the fact that the basis for atta chment of the HLA mo lecules to the beads differs between the 2 assays. Luminex false-negative results. False-positive FCXm results have been ribed due to the presence of IgG autoab, non-HLA ab or monoclonal ab, Fc-receptors, complement receptors or other immunoglobulins on the cell surface13,14. The percentage of false positive FCXm in our study is very low (3.5% for T-cell FCXm and 2.3% for B-cell FCXm) even though no pretreatment of lymphocytes with pronase was performed to reduce non-specific background16-18. The explanation for the low rate of false-positive FCXm in this study could be 1) the comparison of the FCXm outcome with a very sensitive techniqu e, the SA bead assay, and 2) the specific FCXm protocol used, including centrifugation11 and heat-inactivation12 of the sera. In bead-based immuno-assays, binding of HLA molecules to beads may modify the structure of the molecule and the accessib ility of epitopes. Impaired binding of HLA antibodies may subsequently result in false positive or negative reactions8,19. It is possible that the so-called lysate control, us ed as a check for the correct attachment of HLA class I and II molecules, to the beads, does not reflect correctly the binding of all class I and II antigens. An attempt to reduce the cell concentration of the lymphocyte population, necessary to provide the donor antigens for the capture beads, also revealed problems in class II binding, although class I seemed to be unaffected. One of the major advantages of the solid-phase approach for both screening and crossmatching is that a clear distinction ca n be made between class I and class II ab and that no viable cells are necessary. The objective measurement of MFI values by a flow analyser in stead of subjective microsco pe readings is also an advantage, as is the multiplexing capacity of the LumXm, which enables performance of 96 different LumXm at the same time. The assay is performed within 3 h, which makes it adequate for prospective crossmatching for deceased donor organ transplantation in 24 h services. The LumXm assay in its present form, do es not distinguish between complement- binding and non-complement-binding DS ab. The use of different types of labelled second ab as IgG subclasses or IgM might extend the test to more specific ab classes20. In this respect, the clinical relevance of complement binding ab has been described extensively, the role of non-complement-binding HLA ab in kidney transplantation is less clear21. In conclusion, with the DS LumXm described here, a crossmatch assay is available that is performed in the same technique that many laboratories nowadays use for ab detection in transplant candidates. At th is moment, the validity of the LumXm has been shown for class I, but its value for cla ss II is uncertain. HLA DR is most probably correctly identified and the validit y for DQ and DP is doubtful. 120Chapter 7 References 1. Pei R, Lee J-H, Shih N-J, Chen M, Terasaki PI.

This study was designed to determine the clinical rele vance of the recently introduced bead-based Luminex donor-specific crossmatch (LumXm). A group of 165 patients transpla nted between 1997 and 2001 were tested. Out of 165 recipients transplanted with a negative complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) crossmatch, 32 proved to have a positive Luminex crossmatch. Sixt een were positive for class I, 15 were positive for class II, 1 was both class I and II positi ve and 133 recipients were negative. Acute rejection (AR)-free survival for all recipients wa s 77%, and there was no difference in AR-free survival between LumXm-positive and LumXm-negative recipien ts. Overall graft survival after a median follow-up time of 8 years was 56%. Recipients with a positive class I Lu mXm had worse long-term graft survival (P=0.006). In recipients with a positive class I LumX m 5-year graft survival was 41% vs. 70% in negative patients and 10-year graft survival was 27% vs. 56%. Po sitivity for class II LumXm was not a significant risk factor for graft failure (P=0.7). In conclusion, pretransplant DSA detected by the Lu mXm had no impact on AR episodes. Class II LumXm- positivity proved no significant ri sk factor for graft failure, but the value of the class II LumXm is questionable. A positive class I LumXm resulted in wo rse long-term graft survival compared to a negative one. Clinical relevance of Luminex donor-specific crossmatches: data from 165 renal transplants 123 Introduction The presence of preformed cytotoxic donor-specific anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies (DSA) in recipient seru m prior to renal transplantation is the predominant risk factor for irreversible hy peracute allograft rejection and subsequent graft loss. For that reason, prospective complement-dependent cytotoxicity crossmatches (CDCXms) before renal transplantation have been performed routinely for over forty years1. About 20 years ago, a more sensitive technique, the flow cytometric crossmatch (FCXm), was introduc ed. Many centres, mainly in the United States and the UK, strongly advocate the use of this technique2, while others regard it as a test that prevents recipients to obtain grafts that would potentially function well3. For CDC and FC, a crossmatch is available in the same technique that laboratories use for routine antibody detection. The CDCXm and the FCXm are cell-based assays differing in sensitivity, but comparable in specificity and both methods have disadvantages. CDCXm interpretation is complicated because non-graft damaging autoreactive immunoglobuline M (IgM)-anti bodies as well as alloantibodies are detected. CDCXm and FCXm are subject to interference by non-HLA antibodies that bind to lymphocytes and by therapeutic antibody present in the recipient. Differentiation of antibodies specific for class I and class II requires removal of class I-specific antibodies. For these reasons, many labo ratories are now using solid- phase techniques, in particular the re cently introduced bead-based assay4-6 that offers the advantage of greater sensitivity and specificity for routine antibody screening. For the first time now, a crossmatch has become available using the same bead-based technique. In an earlier study7, we evaluated this technique, the Luminex donor-specific crossm atch (LumXm). LumXm result s of a selected group of patients were compared with FCXm results and the outcome of Luminex Single antigen (LSA) screening. The LumXm proved to be va lid for class I DSA dete ction but of limited value for the detection of class II DSA. The aim of the present study was to evalua te the clinical significance of the donor- specific LumXm in a group of renal transpla nt recipients, who were all transplanted with a negative CDCXm over a 4-year period. Materials and Methods Patients Two hundred and thirty-eight consecutive ABO-compatible renal transplantations with a negative CDCXm were performed between January 1997 and January 2001 at the University hospital of Maastricht. Follow-up was continued up to May 2008. From 165 124Chapter 8 of these donor-recipient pairs, sufficien t donor lymphocytes were available to retrospectively perform donor-specific LumXm with the sera drawn at the time of the transplantation. Pretransplant characteristic s of the patients included in the study are given in Table 8.1. The pretransplant characteristics from the 73 patients without available donor lymphocytes were comparable to those of the patients included in the study. Table 8.1 Patient characteristics.

Calcineurine inhibitor was cyclosporine (CSA) in 8 and tacrolimus (T AC) in 157. Addition al immunosupression consisted of azathioprine in 1 recipient, mycophenolate mofetil in 74 and rapamycine in 14. Five recipients participated in a multicenter clinical trial, and therefore, they received induction therapy with interleuki ne-2-receptor antagonist. CSA levels were determined whole blood by enzyme monoclonal immuno test (Dade Behring, Newark, DE) or high-performance liquid chromatography-MS/MS. In the first 3 months after transplantation, target CsA trough levels were 0.10 to 0.15 mg/l, afterwards decreasing to 0.05 to 0.10 mg/l. TAC trough levels were measured in whole blood by ImX (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) or high performance liquid chromatography-MS/MS, target levels were 15 to 20ng/ml for weeks 1 and 2 and 10 to 15ng/ml for weeks 3 and 4, thereafter tapering at 5 to 7ng/ml. Clinical relevance of Luminex donor-specific crossmatches: data from 165 renal transplants 125 Clinical outcome parameters A biopsy was taken during surgery 1 h after reperfusion for every transplant. Acute rejection (AR) was defined as any rejection treatment within 6 months after grafting. All rejection episodes were prov en by needle core biopsy. No fresh-frozen material for C4d staining was available because of the retrospective design of the study. AR treatment for vascular rejection co nsisted of a 10-day course of rabbit antithymocyte globulin or three doses of me thylprednisolone (0.5-1.0 g/dose) in case of tubulointerstitial rejection. Delayed graft function (DGF) was defined as the need for dialysis in the first week after transplantation. Graft failure was defined as loss of kidney function (return to renal replacement therapy or retransplantation) but also included death with functioning graft. All patients were followed up until date of graft failure, date of death or May 2008. Centre policy of tissue typing During the investigation period all patients and donors were typed for HLA-A, -B, -DR and -DQ by serology and polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP). All recipient sera were screened before transplantation for presence of anti- HLA class I and II antibodies by CDC using the two-colour fluorescence technique on unseparated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Reading was performed with an automated Leitz inverted fluorescence microscope. HLA antigens were considered unacceptable for a patient if antibodies against the specificity had ever been demonstrated, either at the time of transp lantation or in the past. Mismatches from previous transplants were excluded, as were the paternally inherited antigens of children of female patients. All transplant s were performed under the auspices of Eurotransplant, which means th at only HLA-A, -B and -DR matches were included in the allocation algorithm. Prospective CDC and FCXm Crossmatches Before transplantation, CDCXms were performed using unseparated PBLs: the standard national institute of health (NIH) crossmatch with and without dithiothreitol (DTT) to reduce IgM antibodies. Sera used for the final crossmatch were the pretransplant serum drawn at the time of tr ansplantation, the la st serum tested for anti-HLA antibodies in the quarterly scre ening and all relevant positive historical samples. A negative class I DTT-Xm for current as well as historical sera was mandatory for transplantation. T- and B-cell FCXm from current and historical sera are performed for all transplantations according to the technique described by Scornik et al.8 with slight modifications, that is centrifugation9 and heat inactivation of the sera10 to reduce the number of false positive results. The re sult of the FCXm is not considered in the decision regarding transplantation. A positiv e FCXm result therefore is no reason for exclusion from this study. 126Chapter 8 Retrospective LumXms Donor-specific LumXm of 165 recipients tr ansplanted with a negative CDCXm were performed according to the manufacturer's (DSA, Tepnel Lifecodes, Stamford, USA) recommendations as described previously7. sera used for LumXm were the same pretransplant sera as used for the original CDCXM. In short, a lysate prepared with donor lymphocytes was incubated for 30 min with capture beads to enable binding of the solubilized donor-HLA molecules onto the beads. The mixture was washed three times with wash buffer using a 96-well filter plate (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in conjunction with a vacuum manifold. Diluted recipient serum was added and incubated for 30 min. After another thr ee washes, anti-human immunoglobulin G (IgG)-conjugated phycoerythrine (1:10) was added and incubated for 30 min. All incubations were performed on a gently rotating platform in the dark at room temperature. After addition of wash buffer, the LABScan100 flow cytometer (Luminex\u00a9) was used for mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) measurement of capture and control beads. To define positivity, the median MFI value of the three negative controls was subtracted from the MFI value of the capture bead. This adjusted MFI was then compared with the adjusted MFI of the positive control bead. A ratio of 5% and/or an adjusted MFI value of 1000 for the capture bead were considered to be positive. For antibody specificity analysis by the LSA assay, the reactivi ty of three strong allosera was determined. For each bead, the positive control value was set at the mean of the three MFI values obtained. A positive bead reaction was subsequently defined as an MFI value of at least 10% of the po sitive control value for that bead. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software (SPSS, Cary, NC). Groups were compared with parametric (independent samples Student's t-test) and non-parametric tests (Pearson chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Kruskal-Wallis test). A P-value of 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Kaplan -Meier survival analysis was used to analyze differences in rejection-free survival and graft survival (log-rank statistic). Rejection-free survival and graft survival were also analyzed with the proportional hazards regression analysis (Cox regression) using stepwise backward e limination techniques for all suspected risk factors. With rejection as outcome parameter, the suspected risk factors tested for in the basic model included cro ssmatch outcome of current serum: \"class I and (living vs mortal) and (heartbeating vs. non-heartbeating)\" and transplant characteristics: \"transplant Clinical relevance of Luminex donor-specific crossmatches: data from 165 renal transplants 127 number (first transplant vs re-transplanta tion)\", \"mismatch class I HLA-A, B (0 HLA-DR (0 vs. 1)\", \"cold ischemia (hou rs)\". With graft survival as outcome parameter \"acute rejection within 6 months (no vs. yes)\" and \"delayed graft function (immediate graft function vs. delayed graft function)\" were included as suspected risk factors to the model. Results Luminex donor-specific crossmatches Donor lymphocytes and pretransplant patient sera of 165 renal transplant recipients transplanted between 1997 and 2001 with a negative CDCXm were available for retrospective LumXm. Out of 165 recipients , 32 (19%) were found to have a positive LumXm. Sixteen recipients had a positive cl ass I LumXm, 15 were positive for class II and 1 recipient was positive for both class I and II. The remaining 133 recipients were negative. No statistically significant diff erences in patient characteristics were observed between the LumXm positive and LumXm negative recipients (Table 8.1), with the exception of a higher incidence of immunization in the positive group (25%) compared to the negative one (7%) (P=0.002). Comparing FCXm with LumXm results showed that the number of positive LumXm was clearly higher than the number of posit ive FCXm. Of 17 class I LumXm-positive recipients, 3 were T-cell FCXm positive, while 14 were T-cell FCXm negative. Three T-cell FCXm-positive recipients were class I LumXm negative. Sixteen recipients were class II LumXm positive, 2 of them had a positive B-cell FCXm, while 14 patients were B-cell FCXm negative. Four B-cell FCXm-positive recipients were class II LumXm negative (Table 8.2). All LumXm positive sera were examined by LSA. DSA were found in 5 out of 17 class I and 5 out of 16 class II LumXm positive sera. Table 8.2 Comparison of donor-specific class I and II LumXm and FCXm results.

Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression analyses did not reveal statistically significant differences between the LumXm-positive and the LumXm-negative recipients (Table 8.3). AR-free survival was 81% for recipients with a positive class I LumXm and 76% for class I negative patients (log-rank 2=0.31, df=1, P=0.6; Figure 8.1).

Five-year graft survival in recipients with a positive class I LumXm was 41% vs. 70% in class I-negative survival 27% vs. 56%. In multivariate Cox regression an alysis, significant risk factors for graft failure were a positive class I LumXm [odds ratio (OR) =2.47, P=0.005] and HLA-B mismatch ( 1 vs. 0) (OR=2.56, P=0.009; Table 8.5). For class II LumXm positivity, there was no difference in graft survival (log-rank 20.14, df=1, P=0.7; Figure 8.4). Five-year graft survival in recipients with a positive class II LumXm was 88% vs. 64% in recipients with a negative class II LumXm, and 10-year graft survival was 50% vs. 53%.

In many countries, the more sensitive FC Xm is used, which detects both complement- activating and non-complement-activating antibodies. The widespread use is based on studies showing worse graft survival in T-cell FCXm-positive regraft recipients11,12. The clinical relevance of a positive B-cell FCXm13,14 is still a matter of debate15 as is the positive FCXm for primary transplant recipients16. A previous study from our centre showed T-cell FCXm not to be superior to th e classical CDCXm with regard to clinical outcome in renal transplant recipients, both retransplanted as well as sensitized first 132Chapter 8 transplants3. These findings were considered to be the result of the specific pretransplant antibody screening protocol and the general centre policy on obtaining all relevant patient information on immuni zation. Nevertheless, FCXms were adopted in our centre and are performed for living-related and -unrelated transplants as well as for postmortal transplants. At this moment their results are only taken into account for living related and unrelated transplants. Recently, we evaluated a new bead-based solid-phase crossmatch, the LumXm, in which the actual donor-HLA antigens are coated onto specific capture beads7. LumXm results of a selected group of recipients we re compared with results obtained by the LSA assay. Sensitivity of the LumXm was 96% for class I and 65% for class II, and specificity was 100% and 97%, respectively. The LumXm proved to be valid for class I DSA detection, and the value for class II DSA was however uncertain; HLA-DR antibodies were most probably correctly id entified, and the detection of HLA-DQ and -DP was doubtful or absent. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical significance of the LumXm in a group of consecutive CDCXm negative transplant recipients. Little is known about the clinical relevance of pretransplant DSA detected by solid- phase but not by cell-based techniques. Some authors claim higher AR rates and worse graft survival in recipients with DSA detect ed by solid-phase assays in the crossmatch- negative pre-transplant sera17-20. In a previous paper, we reported on LSA screening for HLA antibody and the effect of donor-specific antibodies found in a group of highly sensitized patients (PRA>85%) transplant ed with a negative CDCXm within the Eurotransplant Acceptable Mismatch program21. We concluded that DSA detected by the LSA assay in the peak historical sera of this patient group may be related to a higher incidence of AR episodes. When an alysis was performed on the LSA results of the current sera, however, DSA-positive and -negative recipients had comparable AR-free survival. Long-term graft survival wa s not affected by DSA detected by LSA in both peak and current sera. Nineteen per cent of the recipients transplanted between 1997 and 2001 with a negative CDCXm presented with a positive Lu mXm. In the LumXm-positive group, more patients were sensitized than in the negative group. Neither Kaplan-Meier nor Cox regression analysis showed a statistical difference in AR-free survival between recipients with a positive and a negative LumXm. At a median follow-up time of 8 years, however, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regr ession analyses of graft survival showed a statistically significant di fference in graft survival between class I-positive and class I-negative recipients. For class II, such a difference was not observed. These data are concordant with the findings of Gupta et al., who showed AR rates in DSA-positive recipients detected by LSA, to be similar to those in negative recipients. However, DSA positivity proved to be associated with an increased risk of long-term graft failure22. Clinical relevance of Luminex donor-specific crossmatches: data from 165 renal transplants 133 All LumXm-positive sera were examined by LSA. DSA were found in 5 out of 17 class I and 5 out of 16 class II LumXm positive se ra. The discrepancies between LumXm and LSA can be explained by the difference in preparation of the beads used in both techniques. For the LumXm, the actual donor-HLA antigens are coated onto the crossmatch beads. The Single antigen beads are coated with purified HLA antigens cultured in cell lines. Thus, the density of antigens expressed on the respective beads may differ, resulting in a difference in sen sitivity. Also, binding of HLA molecules to beads may modify the structure of the antige ns, especially in the case of the LSA, where the molecules are purified and the pe ptide is dislodged from the groove of the molecule. This modification of structure may have an effect on epitope accessibility and subsequent on antibody binding. From the 12 graft losses in the class I LumXm-positive group, 5 occurred within 2 months after grafting. Three of the five re cipients died shortly after transplantation; one recipient died with a functioning graf t due to cardiac arrest, one graft never functioned (rejection was excluded by biop sy) and the recipient died of myocardial ischemia and one died as a result of haemorrhage caused by an infection of the graft. The two remaining recipients underwent tran splantectomy; one lost his graft the day after transplantation due to technical problems and the other graft never functioned and was removed two months after transplantation (repeated biopsies did not show rejection). The remaining seven graft losses in the class I LumXm positive-group occurred late after grafting. Two recipients di ed with functioning gr afts. Five recipients lost their graft because of chronic allograft nephropathy while on immunosuppression. In the class I LumXm-negative group, 14 of 61 graft losses were because of chronic allograft nephropathy while on immuno suppression. Thus, the incidence of immunological failures in the class I LumX m-positive group (42%) is nearly twice as high as that in the class I LumXm negative group (23%). Because of small numbers; this difference in AR rate between the class I LumXm-positive and the class I LumXm- negative recipients did not re ach statistical significance. The class I LumXm proved to be more sensitive than the T-cell FCXm. Fourteen patients were class I LumXm positive with a negative T-cell FCXm, while only 3 class I LumXm- positive recipients had a positive T-cell FCXm . The graft survival in both groups was significantly worse compared with recipients with a negative class I LumXm. Three patients were class I LumXm negative but showed a positive T-cell FCXm; their graft survival was comparable to that of 145 cl ass I LumXm/T-cell FCXm-negative recipients (data not shown). We assumed that the three recipients with class I LumXm neg/T-cell FCXm positive results probably possessed non-HLA antibodies. The contribution of preformed anti-HLA class II antibodies to graft rejection and graft loss was long poorly understood. Testing ag ainst B cells for their detection was less than satisfactory. The B-cell FCXm proved to be technically difficult, and interpretation 134Chapter 8 of the results was not easy due to lack of specificity23. A positive B-cell FCXm can result from the presence of anti-HLA class II antibo dies, weak anti-HLA class I antibodies and autoreactive or non-HLA antibodies. Th erapeutic antibodies, Fc-receptors and immunoglobulins on the surface of the B ce ll may also yield false-positive B-cell FCXm results. With the introduction of solid-p hase techniques, class II antibodies are detected easily and their impact on AR an d graft survival assessed more accurately. Using this Luminex technique, Eng et al. demonstrated that only one third of positive B-cell FCXm are caused by class II antibodies and were associated with late graft loss24. Class II antibodies represent a significant risk factor for transplant dysfunction and failure as described by several authors25-27. The lack of association between a positive class II LumXm and graft survival in our pres ent study is most probably because of the fact that the LumXm in its present form only detects HLA-DR antibodies and some but not all HLA-DQ and -DP antibodies7. In conclusion, the class I LumXm proved to be more sensitive than the FCXm, and 14 patients were LumXm positive while FCXm negative. LumXm class II positivity was no significant risk factor for graft failure, but one should bear in mind that the class II LumXm in its present form does not detect all class II anti-HLA antibodies. Pretransplant donor-specific anti-HLA class I antibodies detected by LumXm have no impact on AR episodes; however, a positiv e class I LumXm results in worse long-term graft survival compared to a negative one. Considering the improved patient survival after transplantation and the late occurrence of graft failure in class I LumXm-positive recipients, for every patient, the balance between transplantation with a kidney after a class I LumXm-positive result or waiting for a class I LumXm-negative donor kidney has to be determined.

The presence of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) in a kidney tran splant patient is strongly asso ciated with acute antibody- mediated rejection. Therefore pretransplan t crossmatches are performed to identify patients at risk of losing their graft due to hyperacute rejection1. The method used in histocompatibility laboratories for over half a century has been the CDC crossmatch2. Transplant immunologists try to establish very precisely the pretransplant immune status of a kidney recipient in order to be able to choose the right graft for a potential transplant recipient and to avoid positive cr ossmatches at the time of transplant. As described in Chapters 1 and 2, screenin g for preformed DSA has evolved from the relatively insensitive complement-dependent cytotoxicity to more sensitive solid- phase assays, where purified HLA antigens attached to beads are used as antibody detection target3. For that reason the Luminex bead based Single antigen assay is of the utmost importance in describing the HL A antibody profile of a future transplant recipient. Despite the development of increasingly effective immunosuppressive drugs chronic allograft nephropathy, presently kn own as chronic transplant dysfunction, remains a major barrier to long-term renal graft survival4. The identification of the factors responsible for the development of chronic allograft nephropathy is important, since this will provide a basis for the establishme nt of interventions that may arrest its progression. Evidence suggests that the hu moral immune response plays an important role in the development of chronic transplant dysfunction, and for that reason several authors recommend antibody monitoring after transplantation5,6. The detection of HLA antibodies and especially the determ ination of their spec ificity remains an important goal of histocompatibility testing. Solid-phase antibody detection techniques: Luminex technology As mentioned before the solid phase techniques, in particular the Luminex Single antigen assay allows accurate identification of HLA class I and II antibodies at a much more sensitive and specific level than conv entional CDC and according to some authors even FC. The main advantages are that the assay detects complement-binding as well as non-complement-binding IgG HLA antibodies and that class I and class II HLA antibodies can be clearly discriminated7. Analysis of complex antibody profiles in highly sensitized patients is made possible, thereby allowing definition of acceptable and non-acceptable mismatches . Also so-called virtual crossmatching is within reach8. However, the highest level of sensitivity in antibody detection does not necessarily translate into clinical rele vance of the antibodies detected. Whether or not low antibody levels have a deleterious impact on the graft depends also on the 140Chapter 9 immunoglobulin (sub) class, the ability to bind compleme nt and the avidity of the antibody. The sensitivity of the Single antigen assay depends on the cut-off point used to define positive and negative bead reactions. This cut-off point has to be defined by the user and therefore may differ considerably between laboratories. Many cut-off points have been described in the literature for the assay, ranging from 500-6000 median fluorescence intensity (MFI) value9-14. For our first study on pretransplant DSA detected by the Single antigen assay (describ ed in Chapter 3 of this thesis), the cut-off point for positivity was established by test ing three positive control sera (PRA >90%) with Single antigen beads for both class I and II. For every single bead in the assay, the positive control value was set at the mean MFI value of these sera. A positive bead reaction was subsequently defined as an MFI value of at least 10% of the positive control value for that specific bead, which correlated with a cut-off point for positivity of approximately 1000 MFI. In our later studies on post-transplant DSA (chapters 4, 5, 6 ) , a n M F I v a l u e o f 2 0 0 0 w a s u s e d a s c u t-off point for positivity, being the value corresponding most closely to a positive flow -cytometry crossmatch in our hands. This cut-off point is not necessarily the same for tests produced by different manufacturers. In a recent quality assurance-testing progra m by the Australian National Association of Testing Authorities, the results of Single antigen assays were compared between laboratories and different vendors. The MFI values and bead rankings sorted by MFI were reproducible between laboratories using products from the same vendor, which was not the case when using products from different vendors15. Results of Single antigen assays may be infl uenced by different amounts of antigen or immunogenic epitope on the SA bead. Also the configuration may be altered and not represent the one found on intact cells. The presence of IgM antibodies in the serum may hinder the binding of IgG antibodies to the SA beads, which can be overcome by the addition of DTT to the test16. In a study by Kosmoliaptis, the addition of DTT to patient sera markedly increased (doubled) the antibody binding to HLA class I and/or class II specificities in 18% of the sera. In a cohort of highly sensitized patients, treatment of sera with DTT enhanced antibo dy-binding levels in 93% of the tested sera17. To reduce variation in antibody definition caused by day to day testing or measurement on different platforms, and to compare results between different laboratories, another unit of fluorescence has been introduced. The MESF (molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome) valu e, are converted from MFI values to accurately compare quantitative fluorescence intensities18,19. Another approach to overcome this problem is the expression of th e MFI value as a percentage of maximum binding as determined by a monoclonal antibody for each HLA specificity20. This allows correcting for variation in antigen density on Single antigen beads between different lots of the SA assay. A variant of this approach was used for the cut-off determination in chapter 3. General discussion141 For clinical purposes, it was considered de sirable to define a cut-off value for those HLA antibodies that were acceptable or not acceptable for a patient waiting for a renal transplant. This cut-off point should include all HLA antibodies that were detected in the CDC screening and were considered rele vant. To clarify how the results of the regular CDC screening compared to the results obtained with the Single antigen assay, we tested well-known HLA typing sera in both techniques. As described in Chapter 2, more than 100 sera for which CDC specificity and reaction strength were well defined, have been tested with Single antigens class I and II. For each serum the main CDC specificity and extra spec ificities if present, were categorized according to the MFI value obtained. For class I 99% of all CD C specificities (main plus extra) had an MFI value of >4000, for class II this wa s 92%. The reason for the latter lower percentage is that the Single antigen class II assay contains multiple beads coated with the same serological class II specificity, but not necessarily the same subtype specificity. For the analysis, the mean MFI value of all sp ecific beads (regardless of subtype) was used. Based on the results of the studies pr eviously performed and those from the typing sera, the cut-off point for positivity of the Single antigen assay was set at 4000 MFI or higher for c linical transplant purposes in our centre. We feel confident that in this way all specificit ies detected by the classical CDC screening are covered and listed as non-acceptable antigens for a future transplant recipient. As a consequence of this policy, specificities with an MFI value of >4000, not detected in CDC, are also considered unacceptable for a patient. Clinical relevance of pre-transplant HLA antibodies We have shown that in patients transplant ed with a negative CDC crossmatch in the Eurotransplant AM program, the presence of DSA detected only by the Single antigen assay, was associated with a higher incide nce of treatable acute rejection within the first 6 months post-transplant, but was not related to poorer graft survival when compared to patients without DSA (chapter 3). Currently all patients transplanted in the AM program in the Netherlands have been tested by Luminex Single antigens and the preliminary data of this nationwide st udy, confirm our results on graft survival. About 50% of patients have DSA in their pr e-transplant serum by Single antigens, but the DSA do not effect graft survival. No data on acute rejections were available for this study (personal communication Prof . I. Doxiadis, Eurotransplant) In the past three years, several studies investigated the effe ct of low strength pre-transplant DSA detected by the Single antigen assay on acute rejection rate and graft survival. The study designs and the cu t-off points used for determining positive bead reactions differed considerably betw een studies. All included large consecutive series of patients with different PRA values and different pre-transplant protocols. In some studies correlations with acute rejection were found21-23, and some showed DSA 142Chapter 9 to be correlated to graft survival21,22,24. The different results may be explained by the fact, that in our study, only highly sensitiz ed recipients (>85%) were included, who had been extensively screened in CDC and ELIS A. Their sensitization history was well known, as were their acceptable and non-acceptable antigens. Increased sensitivity results in a larger number of specific HLA antibo dies identified in a patient's serum. When those antibodies are listed as non-acceptable mismatches, as is customary within Eurotransplant, it prolongs the waiting time and leads to a higher percentage of sensitized recipients. This clearly has implications for organ allocation, because sensitized recipients receive extra tr ansplant points. As long as no consensus on the cut-off point for Single antigen positiv ity exists, patients from different centres will be put on the waiting list with inco mparable antibody statuses. The present uncertainty on the relevance of antibodies detected by the Single antigen assay influences the allocation program for the whole Eurotransplant organization. The number of highly sensitized patients will ri se, which may have a clear impact on the Eurotransplant AM program. That this threat is considered real, is revealed by the recent implementation of Eurotransplant (also based on the results of our study presented in Chapter 3) that recipients wi th antibodies detected by Luminex Single antigen only, are not considered for the AM Solid-phase crossmatch: Luminex crossmatch the use of crossmatch methods of similar or greater sensitivity than those used in screening to define the presence of antibodies. For that reason the availability of a prospective crossmatch in the Luminex technique is highly desirable. It has the a dded advantages that no viable cells are needed for the crossmatch, is specific fo r HLA antibodies and reading is easy and automated. Chapter 7 is the first report ever on the use of a Luminex Crossmatch (DSA, donor specific antibody detectio n, Tepnel). The results obtained were compared with results from flow cytometric crossmatches. Sensitivity and specificity of the Luminex crossmatch for class I were 89% and 98% and for class II 68% and 97%. After all sera were tested with the Single antigen assay from One Lambda, to define the DSA in each serum, the sensitivity of the Luminex crossmatch proved to be higher for class I (96%) than class II (65%). Th e Luminex crossmatch did not detect any HLA-DQ antibodies, HLA-DP antibody detect ion was insufficient, only HLA-DR seemed to be correctly identified. Recently Caro-Ole as compared results of the Single antigen assay to the Luminex crossmatch in sera that were well defined by CDC. The sensitivity of the Single antigen assay was found to be higher than that of the Luminex crossmatch for both class I an d II, regardless of the fact that crossmatch and screening assay were from the same vendor26. This study also confir med our finding that the Luminex crossmatch does not identify HLA-DQ antibodies. We therefore feel that the test in its present form is not suit able for use in a clinical setting. General discussion143 The clinical significance of the Luminex cro ssmatch was evaluated over a 4-year period, as described in Chapter 8. The Luminex crossmatch was performed for consecutive renal transplant recipients, who have all b een transplanted on the basis of a negative CDC crossmatch. A positive class I Luminex cr ossmatch with the current pre-transplant serum had no impact on acute rejection ep isodes, but resulted in worse long-term graft survival compared to a negative class I Luminex crossmatch. The class II Luminex crossmatch had no effect on acute rejection or graft survival, probably because the test proved not to detect HLA-DQ and -DP antibodies. Recently a second report on the clinical relevance of the Luminex crossmatch in 37 selected recipients with pre-transplant HLA antibodies, was published this year. No relationship with graft survival was shown, the maximum follow-up time was only 3 years. A clear relationship between the class I Luminex crossmatch and antibody-mediated acute rejection was established if they combined the results of the class I Luminex crossmatch with the results of the SA test. Antibody mediated acute rejection was found in 80% of the patients with a positive class I Luminex crossm atch and an MFI value >900 in the Single antigen test (test spec 96%)27. The conclusion of our studies still remains that the Luminex crossmatch for class II has to be improved, at least for DQ antibodies. Pre-transplant donor-specific anti-HLA class I antibodies detected by the Luminex crossmatch have no impact on acute reje ction episodes; however, a positive class I Luminex crossmatch results in worse long-ter m graft survival compared to a negative one. Considering the improved patient surv ival after transplantation and the late occurrence of graft failure in class I Lumine x crossmatch-positive recipients, for every patient, the balance between transplantatio n with a kidney after a class I positive crossmatch result or waiting for a class I negative crossmatch donor kidney has to be determined. Clinical relevance of post-transplant HLA antibodies Presence of HLA antibodies has been described before failure28, and their detection is considered to be useful in predicting graft failure29. There is however no consensus on antibody positivity shown by the Single antigen assay, the time of appearance of DSA nor the class of DSA detected. The frequency and nature of \"de novo\" HLA DSA after kidney transplantation detected by Single antigen was analyzed in Chapter 4. The presence of DSA was monitored from the time of transplantation up to 14 years thereafter. All patients were DSA negative by Single antigen before transplantation, had a negative CDC crossmatch, at least 1 year of renal function and were tested 5-12 times (average 8) during follow-up. Post- transplant DSA were detected frequently (25%). Slightly more class II than I was detected, and class II antibodies were mainly against HLA-DQ. Only persistent class II DSA, that were present more than one year after transplantation, turned out to result in worse clinical outcome. Its presence was associated with graft survival, but did not 144Chapter 9 necessarily lead to immediate loss of graf t function. Most of the DSA found were persistent throughout the follow-up period, but a new finding was that in a number of patients the DSA were present only for a short period of time. These so-called \"transient\" DSA were characterized by lowe r MFI values than the persistent ones and were not related to graft survival. We concluded from the study that the detection of DSA posttransplant in a single serum sample , has to be interpreted with caution and may not necessarily justify the use of therap eutic interventions. Furthermore, the fact that only the presence of class II DSA was found to be predictive of graft failure after adjusting for a number of clinical variables, is concordant with recent publications on the importance and relevance of class II HLA antibodies30-33. The high number of patients with anti-DQ antibodies was remarkable. In this respect it would be desirable if within Eurotransplant, histocompatibilty laboratories would be obliged to report on HLA-DQ typing of potential donors to the transplant recipient centres. Although this study was unique in terms of number of consecutive patients with a long follow-up and multiple sera tested, a drawback of our study is the fact that patients included in this study did not have their yearly follow-up consultation in our centre, and therefore many samples are missing. Also because of the retr ospective nature of the study no biopsies from the time of failure were available. Therefore, it is difficult to identify the specific reasons for graft failu re. This study allows the identification of patients with an increased risk of (immuno logical) graft failure for future randomized controlled trials to target immunologic failure by specific interventions. After transplantation DSA may be undetectable in the circulation because they are absorbed by the graft. This was demonstrated by the fact that these antibodies are eluted from rejected transplants34,35 and the appearance of previously undetectable antibodies by CDC following transplantectomy36. Testing for HLA antibodies in re-transplant candidates, who still have their gr aft in situ, is therefore of limited value. The study in Chapter 5 was designed to test whether antibodies before transplant failure and transplantectomy would be detectable using the Single antigen assay. Time of DSA appearance was monitored in a group of 53 first renal transplant recipients, who lost their graft at different time poin ts after transplantation (median 50 days post-transplant). 81% became DSA positive after transplantation, 16% before and 84% after transplantectomy. Logistic regression an alysis showed that DSA positivity for class I was related to higher donor age and donor type (non-heart-beating), class II to higher donor age and class II mismatch. Looking at the time of transplantectomy, patients who lost their graft between 1-6 months all became DSA positive and showed a higher number of class II mismatches and acute rejections. Remarkably, the majority of the DSA were found several months after transplantectomy. Although there still is discussion on the clinical utility of transplantectomy versus leavin g the rejected graft in place37, in our centre failed grafts General discussion145 are removed and immunosuppression is cessated, because continuation of immunosuppressive drugs after return to dialysis is not tolerated due to side effects. It remains to be elucidated whether the antibodies found circulating after transplantectomy, are antibodies that were previously absorbed by the graft or were formed after the transplantec tomy due to the cessation of immunosuppression and/or as a result of the fact that the vascul ar patch of the anastomosis was still in situ38. In general patients are tested for the presence of HLA antibodies only when they are on the ET waiting list, for transplantectomized patients this means that they are monitored only if considered for re-transpl antation. Based on our results we propose that patients after transplantectomy are monitored for the presence of antibodies for at least 6 months. In our local protocol, se ra are collected after a transplantectomy and monitored for antibodies at regular intervals until 6 months later. For recipients that receive a kidney donor offer before they have been monitored for half a year, prospective pretransplant crossmatches have to be performed with all historically relevant sera as well as a serum drawn at the time of the crossmatch. In the transplantectomy study, the recipients of a NHB donor had a higher risk of DSA positivity. Combined with the fact that kidneys from non-heart-beating donors experience an increased incidence of pr imary non-function compared to kidney transplantation from heart-beating donor, this may point to a more stringent acceptance of NHB donors. This has to be balanced against the fact that even transplantation with NHB donors has been shown to result in increased patient survival compared to remainin g on dialysis and the waiting list39. A recent study by Marrari et al. on patients with late transplantectomy (mean 6.6 years), found a higher incidence of DSA before transplantectomy but the same overall incidence of DSA after transplantation40. They compared their results to ours and hypothesised that in their stud y, the transplant had been in situ for a longer period of time, thus serving as a continuous source of donor antigens, which had expanded the antibody repertoire. However in our study, late and early graft removal resulted in comparable percentages of DS A. In our study recipients with pre-transplant DSA detected by FC or SA, were excluded from the study, in contrast to the study of Marrari et al. Conclusion In this thesis we have mainly focusse d on the detection and relevance of HLA antibodies in renal transplantation by newer antibody screening and crossmatch techniques. Throughout the literature availa ble on Single antigen testing, there are reports of authors that support the idea that the Single antigen assay is superior to all other tests and that CDC has become obsolete. Specificity and sensitivity are usually reported, however data on clinical relevanc e are scarce. It has even been suggested 146Chapter 9 that the Single antigen assay is too sensitive to use in a clinical setting. Therefore we addressed some of these items. We studied the relationship between Single antigen and CDC results and together with the resu lts of our clinical studies we defined a cut-off point of 4000 MFI for clinical tran splant purposes. DSA by the Single antigen assay proved not to influence graft survival in highly sensitized AM patients. In post-transplant screening DSA are often seen, and unexpectedly a substantial portion of these DSA proved to be transient. Transient DSA had no effect on graft survival in contrast to persistent DSA, if they were class II and present beyond 1 year after transplantation. DSA were particularly shown to be present after failure and transplantectomy, and were related to sp ecific donor, recipient and transplant parameters. The Single antigen assay also allows the detection of class II HLA-DP antibodies, which provides a possibility of studying their impact in renal transplantation. A positive class I Lumine x crossmatch is related to graft failure, although not in the first years after transplantation. The class II Luminex crossmatch needs further development, especially for HLA-DQ and -DP, to become clinically relevant. The data presented in this the sis point to the importance of pre- end post-transplant detection of HLA antibodies and their identification in renal transplantation.

The latter, also known as the adaptive immune response, is triggered when antigen-receptors on lymphocytes recognize antigen presented in the context of MHC molecules. HLA molecules are highly polymorphic and as a consequence, they are able to bind a variety of antigens and present them to the immune system. The response that follows is cellular or humoral. Cellular responses occur when T-cells recognize foreign antigens presented by an HLA molecule on APC's. The humoral immune response is initiated by B-cells and leads to the production of antibodies against the foreign antigen. As discussed in Chapter 1 the recognition of donor-HLA molecules by the recipient's immune system generates an immune response that in renal transplantation, may lead to allograft rejection. The relevance of co mpatibility for ABO and HLA in rejection has been known for decades. Most of the immunosuppressive reagents used nowadays target the cellular rejection response; humoral rejection however is still a matter of concern. In this thesis, we focus our atte ntion on the humoral or antibody-mediated immune response in renal transplantation. Already before transplantation contact with foreign HLA molecules through blood transfusion or pregnancy may lead to the development of HLA antibodies. It is obviou s that transplantation itself is a major trigger for antibody formation. There is abundant evidence that preformed HLA antibodies have a deleterious effect on renal graft outcome as reflected by increased rejection rates and lower graft su rvival in sensitized recipients. Several immunological procedures in the field of histocompatibility are in use to detect the presence of HLA antibodies, thereby decrea sing the rejection rate and increasing graft survival. Some of these procedures ar e screening for HLA antibodies before transplantation, matching the HLA antigens of recipient and final donor and performance of different cross-matches before the donor-kidney is transplanted. There is a high correlation between the degr ee of HLA matching and sensitization. Antibodies produced after renal transplantation constitute a risk factor for acute and chronic rejection. A poor HLA match decreases the chances of finding a second cross- match-negative donor and prolongs the waiting time cytotoxic donor-specific HLA antibodies caus e hyperacute rejection, leading to loss of graft function within minutes to hours after reperfusion. CDC-crossmatches of patient sera and donor cells to identify donor-spec ific antibodies, are routinely performed before transplantation and hyperacute rejection has thus become a rare event in renal transplantation. To prevent positive pret ransplant crossmatches, all sera from recipients on the waiting list are tested for the presence and specificity of HLA antibodies. The specificities detected in the serum are considered non-acceptable mismatches. 152 Our understanding of sensit ization in renal patients, the clinical relevance of HLA antibodies and the available antibody detection and crossmatching techniques have evolved considerably during the last 40 years. In Chapter 2 , the different techniques for antibody detection that have been used over the years are described, with special emphasis on the recently intr oduced bead-based antibody detection technology. This Luminex Single antigen technique uses beads coated with purified HLA molecules, as its target for antibody detection. It is shown to be more sensitive and specific in detecting HLA antibodies than the CDC and ELISA assays. Interpretation has become an important factor in discriminati ng clinically relevant from clinically non- relevant antibodies. The cut-off point for po sitivity of the Luminex Single antigen assay has to be defined by its user and for that reason may differ considerably between laboratories. To clarify how the results of th e assay compare to those of the CDC assay, w e h a v e t e s t e d 1 0 3 H L A t y p i n g s e r a with well-known CDC specificities and CDC reaction strength in the Luminex Single antigen class I and II assay. For each serum the main CDC specificity and, if present, the extra spec ificities, were categorized according to their MFI value. Altogether 99% of all class I CDC spec ificities had an MFI value of 4000 or more, as did 93% of all cla ss II CDC specificities wh en tested with the Luminex Single antigen assay . Based on the results, it was decided in our centre, that the cut-off point for positivity of the Luminex Single antigen assay would be 4000 MFI for clinical transplant purpos es. With this cut-off point all specificities detected by CDC are covered and considered as non-acceptable antigens for a transplant recipient. In Chapter 3 , the clinical relevance of preformed DSA detected by the Luminex Single antigen assay, is studied in a group of highly sensitized recipients transplanted in the AM program. Recipients with a sensitization of 85% or more panelreactive antibodies (PRA) are highly sensitized (HS) and have a lower chance of receiving a kidney donor. For this type of recipients, desensitization protocols have been designed with the intention to remove their HLA antibodies in order to increase their probability of finding a crossmatch-negative donor. Within Eurotransplant (ET) a special program was developed, the Acceptable Mismatch (AM) pr ogram, to facilitate renal transplantation in HS recipients. For highly sensitized recipi ents (current or historical sensitization 85% PRA or more), acceptable HLA mismatches, i. e. antigens to which the recipients had never made antibodies, are determined. The patients are entered on a special waiting list that gives them priority to blood-group-compatible donors that are HLA-A, -B and -DR matched with their own HLA antigens, in cluding the AM antigens. Up till now, the standard technique for the determination of the AM antigens was based on the CDC technique, the same assay in whic h the pre-transplant crossmatch was performed. From 34 AM patients, 27 were transplanted with 1-5 mismatches and 7 with 0 mismatches, for all 34 patients the pr e-transplant and peak sera were retested with LSA. From the mismatched patients 13 proved to possess pre-transplant DSA detected by Luminex Single antigen assay, while 14 did not. No DSA were found in the 0 mismatched group as expected. Compariso n of the DSA-positive and DSA-negative Summary153 patients in the mismatched group revealed a trend towards earlier and more frequent rejection episodes in DSA posit ive patients (P=0.08). No detrimental effect of DSA on graft survival was observed. This single centre study showed that in the AM program, DDA detected by LSA and not by less sen sitive methods, may be related to acute rejection episodes but are not detrimental to long-term graft outcome. These findings question the indiscriminate use of more sensitive screening techniques for the allocation of organs, more specifically the interpretation of the findings. Chapter 4 describes the prevalence, time of appearance, and HLA class of DSA in a consecutive group of patients transplanted between 1995 and 1999. All 140 renal recipients had no pre-transplant DSA, at least one year of renal function and an extensive follow-up period of up to 14 year s. Multiple serum sa mples (n=1107) of all patients were tested for \"de novo\" DSA with the Luminex Single antigen assay. The presence of DSA after transplantation and before graft failure was shown in 224 serum samples of 35 recipients. In 17 patients DS A were shown that were present only for a short period of time and did not reappear, so-called \"transient\" DSA. Median fluorescence values (MFI) in the Single antigen assay differed considerably for persistent and transient DSA, the median va lues being 12.000 and 3.000 respectively. In multivariate analysis the presence of class II DSA after the first year post-transplant proved to be the only independent risk factor for graft failure (OR=3.2). For transient DSA patients no difference was found between class I and II positivity, both had the same risk of graft failure as DSA negative recipients. From this study, we concluded that class II DSA positivity was predictive of graft failure if appearing after the first year post-transplant. The presence of \"transient\" DSA did not affect graft failure. Persistent DSA was shown to have four times higher MFI values; nevertheless many DSA positive patients had grafts with stable function. In Chapter 5 the appearance of DSA was analyzed in relation to patient and graft characteristics in a group of patients who lost their graft at different time points after transplantation. Pre- and post-transplant sera of 56 CDC-negative first transplant patients were screened for HLA class I and II DSA by the Luminex Single antigen assay. Three out of 56 patients proved DSA posit ive before transplantation. 81% of the remaining 53 patients became DSA class I an d/or II positive; 16% before and 84% after transplantectomy. Class I antibodies were pr oduced in 84% and class II in 77% of the recipients. Based on the time of transplantectomy the recipients were divided into 3 groups: those who lost their graft (1) within one month, (2) between one and six months and (3) after more than six months. The groups proved to be significantly different for HLA class II mism atch and acute rejection. All recipients in group 2 were DSA positive. Median time of DSA appearance was four months after transplantectomy. Logistic regression analysis showed that DSA positivity for class I was related to higher donor age and donor type (non-heart-beating), class II to higher donor age and class II mismatch. Donor-directed HLA antibodies after transplantation 154 were demonstrated in 81% of first transplant recipients. The majority of the antibodies were found after transplantectomy. These findings should be taken into consideration in allocating organs of marginal donors, su ch as older or non-heart-beating kidneys. The major advantage of the Luminex Single antigen assay is that it allows accurate evaluation of sera containing complex mixtures of antibodies. Class I and class II antibodies are clearly discriminated. Fu rthermore, antibodies directed against HLA-DRB3, 4, 5, HLA-DQ and HLA-DP are discriminated from reactivity against HLA-DR, which was difficult or even impossible using the former standard techniques. HLA-DP is considered a target for the humoral immune response in clinical transplantation. In Chapter 6 , the incidence, time of developmen t and epitope-specificity of HLA-DP antibodies in renal patients are examined, Pre- and post-transplant sera of 338 patients were screened for HLA-DP an tibodies using the Luminex Single antigen assay. Patients with DP antibodies, their partners and/or kidney donors were HLA-DP typed by SSO. Potential epitopes were mapped by comparing the amino acid sequences of HLA-DP hypervariable regions (HVR) A-F of recipient, partner and/or donor. Specificities in the sera were alig ned to deduce the HVR motif responsible for the antibodies. DP antibodies were detected in 48 out of 338 patients (14%). Before transplantation, 23% (10 females and one male) was found positive, 77% after transplantation (30 after the first, 7 after the second graft). Specificities were never restricted to individual mismatched antigens ; broad HLA-DP sensitization was found as a rule. A single HVR mismatch was present in 80% of the DSA and in 79% of the non- DSA. Our findings confirm that HLA-DP antibodies are specific for epitopes shared by different HLA-DP antigens, indicating that only a restricted number of mismatched epitopes are recognized by the recipient's immune system . These results suggest that matching for immunogenic HLA-DP epitopes for renal transplantation is possibly more relevant than classical matchi ng at the allelic level. Chapter 7 reports on the Luminex Crossmatch an d compares the results obtained with those flow-cytometric crossmatches. In Luminex bead-based screening assays, color-coded microspheres antigens are used to identify both complement-binding and non-complement-binding HLA class I and II antibodies in recipient sera. Many laboratories rely on all specificities detected and use that information for allocation of donor organs. A donor-specific (DS) crossmatch in the Luminex technique is therefore desirable. The Luminex DS crossmatch (LumXm), in which the actual donor-HLA antigens are coated onto specific capture beads, was tested for 88 pre- and post-transplant sera of 18 recipients. The results were compared to previously published flow cytometric cr ossmatch (FCXm) results for the same donor- recipient combinations. All sera were also examined by the Luminex Single antigen (SA) assays. Class I LumXm detected 24/27 T-cell positive FCXm class B- cell positive FCXm (68%). Sensitivity of LumXm for class I and II was 89% and 68% respectively, specificity 98% and 97%. lts obtained in 13 Summary155 sera of 9 patients (15%). In general, base d on LSA testing, FCXm showed false positive results for class I, LumXm gave false negati ve and positive results for class II. The LumXm test was proven not to react with recipient sera containing DQ antibodies only, also DP detection was insufficient. The valid ity of the LumXm has been shown for class I, but its value for class II is uncertain. HLA- DR is most probably correctly identified, -DQ and -DP are not. In Chapter 8 , the clinical significance of the Lu minex Crossmatch is evaluated over a 4-year period in a group of renal recipients, transplanted on the basis of a negative CDC crossmatch. The clinical significance of the presence of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies prior to renal transplantation detected solely by solid-phase techniques remains unclear. A group of 165 patients transplanted between 1997 and 2001, with a negative CDC crossmatch, was tested. 32/16 5 recipients proved to have a positive LumXm. Sixteen were positive for class I, 15 for class II, one was both class I and II positive and 133 recipients were negative . Acute rejection-free survival for all recipients was 77%, there was no difference in acute rejection-free survival between LumXm-positive and -negative recipients. Overall graft survival after a median follow- up time of 8 years was 56%. Recipients with a positive class I LumXm had worse long- term graft survival (P=0.006), 5-year gr aft survival was 41% vs. 70% in negative patients, and 10-year graft survival was 27% vs. 56%. Positivity for class II LumXm was not a significant risk factor for graft failure (P=0.7), however, as stat ed in chapter 7, the value of the class II crossmatch is question able. In conclusion pre-transplant donor- specific anti-HLA antibodies detected by the LumXm, had no impact on acute rejection episodes. A positive class I LumXm resulted in worse long-term graft survival. 157 Chapter 8 Samenvatting Samenvatting159 Samenvatting Het immuunsysteem die kan leiden afstotingsproces name transplantatie brengt v is een overvloed aan bewijs voorhanden, dat laat zi en zijn de transplantatie, na op te sporen, en zo de kans op afstoting matchen van de HLA antigenen ontvanger en uitvoeren de mate van HLA match van donor en ontvanger en de kans op vorming van HLA antistoffen na ie. afstoting.
