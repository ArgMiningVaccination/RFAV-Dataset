Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), a tumor marker for adenocarcinoma of the prostate, can predict residual tumor in the post -operative phase of prostate cancer. Three to 6 months after radical prostatectomy, PSA is reported to provide a sensitive indicator o f persistent disease. Six months following introduction of antiandrogen therapy, PSA is reported of distinguishing patients with favorable response from those in whom limited response is anticipated. PSA when used in conjunction with other prostate cancer tests, such as digital rectal examination, may assist in the decision -making process for diagnosing prostate cancer. PSA also, serves as a marker in following the progress of most prostate tumors once a diagnosis has been established. This test is also an aid in the management of prostate cancer patients and in detecting metastatic or persistent disease in patients following treatment. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan reimburses for Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) (CPT code 84153), when the claim indicates a code found on the list of approved diagnosis codes for this test.

It is common practice to do a urinalysis prior to a urine culture. A urine culture may also be used as part of the evaluation and management of another related condition. The procedure includes aerobic agar -based isolation of bacteria or other cultivable organisms present, and quantitation of types pr esent based on morphologic criteria. Isolates deemed significant may be subjected to additional identification and susceptibility procedures as requested by the ordering physician. The physician's request may be through clearly documented and communicated laboratory protocols. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan reimburses for Urine Culture, Bacterial (CPT codes 87086 and 87088), when the claim indicates a code found on the list of approved diagnosis codes for this test. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will not reimburse when the treatment rendered is without inclusion of one of the ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes being included on the claim accurately reflecting the member's condition. Serum Iron Studies Serum iron studies are useful in the evaluation of disorders of iron metabolism, particularly iron deficiency and iron excess. Iron studies are best performed when the patient is fasting in the morning and has abstained from medications that may influence iron balance. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of an emia. In young children on a milk diet, iron deficiency is often secondary to dietary deficiency. In adults, iron deficiency is usually the result of blood loss and is only occasionally secondary to dietary deficiency or malabsorption. Following major surg ery the patient may have iron deficient erythropoietin for months or years if adequate iron replacement has not been given. High doses of supplemental iron may cause the serum iron to be elevated. Serum iron may also be altered in acute and chronic inflamm atory and neoplastic conditions. Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) is an indirect measure of transferring, a protein that binds and transports iron. TIBC quantifies transferring by the amount of iron that it can bind. TIBC and transferring are elevated i n iron deficiency, and with oral contraceptive use, and during pregnancy. TIBC and transferring may be decreased in malabsorption syndromes or in those affected with chronic diseases. The percent saturation represents the ratio of iron to the TIBC. Assays for ferreting are also useful in assessing iron balance. Low concentrations are associated with iron deficiency and are highly specific. High concentrations are found in hemosiderosis (iron overload without associated tissue injury) and hemochromato sis (iron overload with associated tissue injury). In these conditions the iron is elevated, the TIBC and transferrin are within the reference range or low, and the percent saturation is elevated. Serum ferritin can be useful for both initiating and monito ring treatment for iron overload. Transferrin and ferritin belong to a group of serum proteins known as acute phase reactants, and are increased in response to stressful or inflammatory conditions and also can occur with infection and tissue injury due to surgery, trauma or necrosis. Ferritin and iron/TIBC (or transferrin) are affected by acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, and in patients with these disorders, tests of iron status may be difficult to interpret.

Lipids Testing Lipoproteins are a class of heterogeneous particles of varying sizes and densities containing lipid and protein. These lipoproteins include cholesterol esters and free cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and A, C, and E apoproteins. Total cholesterol comprises all the cholesterol found in various lipoproteins. Factors that affect blood cholesterol levels inclu de age, sex, body weight, diet, alcohol and tobacco use, exercise, genetic factors, family history, medications, menopausal status, the use of hormone replacement therapy, and chronic disorders such as hypothyroidism, obstructive liver disease, pancreatic disease (including diabetes), and kidney disease. In many individuals, an elevated blood cholesterol level constitutes an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease. Blood levels of total cholesterol and various fractions of cholesterol, especia lly low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C) are useful in assessing and monitoring treatment for that risk in patients with cardiovascular and related diseases. Blood levels of the above cholesterol com ponents including triglyceride have been separated into desirable, borderline and high -risk categories by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute in their report in 1993. These categories form a useful basis for evaluation and treatment of patients w ith hyperlipidemia. Therapy to reduce these risk parameters includes diet, exercise and medication, and fat weight loss, which is particularly powerful when combined with diet and exercise. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan reimburses for Lipids and 84478), when the claim indicates a code found on the list of approved diagnosis codes for this test. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will not reimburse when the treatment rendered is without inclusion o f one of the and ICD -10-CM diagnostic codes being included on the claim accurately reflecting the member's condition. Thyroid Testing Thyroid function studies are used to delineate the presence or absence of hormonal abnormalities of the thyroid and pituitary glands. These abnormalities may be either primary or secondary and often but not always accompany clinically defined signs and symptoms indicative of thyroid dysfunction. Laboratory evaluation of thyroid function has become more scientifically d efined. Tests can be done with increased specificity, thereby reducing the number of tests needed to diagnose and follow treatment of most thyroid disease. Measurements of serum sensitive thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, complemented by determinat ion of thyroid levels total thyroxine (T4) with Triiodothyronine (T3) uptake] are used for diagnosis and follow -up of patients with thyroid disorders. Additional tests may be necessary to evaluate certain complex diagnosti c problems or on hospitalized patients, where many circumstances can skew tests results. When a test for total thyroxine (total T4 or T4 radioimmunoassay) or T3 uptake is performed, calculation of the free thyroxine index (FTI) is useful to correct for abn ormal results for either total T4 or T3 uptake due to protein binding effects. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan reimburses for Thyroid Testing (CPT codes 84436, 84439, 84443, and 84479), when the claim indicates a code found on the list of approved diagnos is codes for this test.

Prothrombin Time (PT) Basic plasma coagulation function is readily assessed with a few simple laboratory tests: the Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT), Prothrombin Time (PT), Thrombin Time (TT), or a quantitative fibrinogen determination. The PT test is one in -vitro labora tory test used to assess coagulation. While the PTT assesses the intrinsic limb of the coagulation system, the PT assesses the extrinsic or tissue factor dependent pathway. Both tests also evaluate the common coagulation pathway involving all the reactions that occur after the activation of factor X. Extrinsic pathway factors are produced in the liver and their production is dependent on adequate vitamin K activity. Deficiencies of factors may be related to decreased production or increased consumption of c oagulation factors. The PT/INR is most commonly used to measure the effect of warfarin and regulate its dosing. Warfarin blocks the effect of vitamin K on hepatic production of extrinsic pathway factors. A PT is expressed in seconds and/or as an internati onal normalized ratio (INR). The INR is the PT ratio that would result if the WHO reference thromboplastin was used in performing the test. Current medical information does not clarify the role of laboratory PT testing in patients who are self- monitoring . Therefore, the indications for testing apply regardless of whether or not the patient is also PT self-testing.

Gamma Glutamyl an intracellular enzyme that appears in blood following leakage from cells. Renal tubules, liver, and pancreas contain high amounts, although the measurement of GGT in serum is almost always used for assessment of Hepatobiliary function. Unlike other enzymes which are found in he art, skeletal muscle, and intestinal mucosa as well as liver, the appearance of an elevated level of GGT in serum is almost always the result of liver disease or injury. It is specifically useful to differentiate elevated alkaline phosphatase levels when t he source of the alkaline phosphatase increase (bone, liver, or placenta) is unclear. The combination of high alkaline phosphatase and a normal GGT does not, however, rule out liver disease completely. As well as being a very specific marker of Hepatobili ary function, GGT is also a very sensitive marker for hepatocellular damage. Abnormal concentrations typically appear before elevations of other liver enzymes or biliuria are evident. Obstruction of the biliary tract, viral infection (e.g., hepatitis, mono nucleosis), metastatic cancer, exposure to hepatotoxins (e.g., organic solvents, drugs, alcohol), and use of drugs that induce microsomal enzymes in the liver (e.g., cimetidine, barbiturates, phenytoin, and carbamazepine) all can cause a moderate to marked increase in GGT serum concentration. In addition, some drugs can cause or exacerbate liver dysfunction (e.g., atorvastatin, troglitazone, and others as noted in FDA Contraindications and Warnings.) GGT is useful for diagnosis of liver disease or injury, exclusion of hepatobiliary involvement related to other diseases, and patient management during the resolution of existing disease or following injury.

Hepatitis Panel/Acute Hepatitis Panel This panel consists of the following tests: Hepatitis A antibody (HAAb), IgM antibody; Hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), IgM antibody; Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and; Hepatitis C antibody. REIMBURSEMENT POLICY CMS -1500 Policy Number 2021R8100 A.LA Proprietary information of UnitedHealthcare Community and State . Copyright 20 21 United Healthc are Services, Inc. 2021R8100A.LA Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver resulting from viruses, drugs, toxins, and other etiologies. Viral hepatitis can be due to one of at least five different viruses, designated hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Most cases are caused by hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV). HAV is the most common cause of hepatitis in children and adolescents in the United States. Prior exposure is indicated by a positive IgG anti -HAV. Acute HAV is diagnosed by IgM anti -HAV, which typically appears within four weeks of exposure, and which disappears within three months of its appearance. IgG anti -HAV is similar in the timing of its appearance, but it persists indefinitely. Its detection indicates pr ior effective immunization or recovery from infection. Although HAV is spread most commonly by fecal -oral exposure, standard immune globulin may be effective as a prophylaxis. HBV produces three separate antigens (surface, core, and e (envelope) antigens) when it infects the liver, although only hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is included as part of this panel. Following exposure, the body normally responds by producing antibodies to each of these antigens; one of which is included in this panel: hepat itis B surface antibody (HBsAb) -IgM antibody. HBsAg is the earlier marker, appearing in serum four to eight weeks after exposure, and typically disappearing within six months after its appearance. If HBsAg remains detectable for greater than six months, th is indicates chronic HBV infection. HBcAb, in the form of both IgG and IgM antibodies, are next to appear in serum, typically becoming detectable two to three months following exposure. The IgM antibody gradually declines or disappears entirely one to two years following exposure, but the IgG usually remains detectable for life. Because HBsAg is present for a relatively short period and usually displays a low titer, a negative result does not exclude an HBV diagnosis. HBcAb, on the other hand, rises to a mu ch higher titer and remains elevated for a longer period of time, but a positive result is not diagnostic of acute disease, since it may be the result of a prior infection. The last marker to appear in the course of a typical infection is HBsAb, which appe ars in serum four to six months following exposure to infected blood or body fluids; in the U.S., sexual transmission accounts for 30% to 60% of new cases of HBV infection. The diagnosis of acute HBV infection is best established by documentation of posit ive IgM antibody against the core antigen (HBcAb -IgM) and by identification of a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is established primarily by identifying a positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and demonstrating positive IgG antibody directed against the core antigen (HBcAb -IgG). Additional tests such as hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), the envelope antigen and antibody, are not included in the hepatitis panel, but m ay be of importance in assessing the infectivity of patients with HBV. Following completion of a HBV vaccination series, HBsAb alone may be used monthly for up to six months, or until a positive result is obtained, to verify an adequate antibody response. HCV is the most common cause of post -transfusion hepatitis; overall HCV is responsible for 15% to 20% of all cases of acute hepatitis, and is the most common cause of chronic liver disease. The test most commonly used to identify HCV measures HCV antibodi es, which appear in blood two to four months after infection. False positive HCV results can occur. For example, a patient with a recent yeast infection may produce a false positive anti -HCV result. For this reason, at present positive results usually are confirmed by a more specific technique. Like HBV, HCV is spread exclusively through exposure to infected blood or body fluids. This panel of tests is used for differential diagnosis in a patient with symptoms of liver disease or injury. When the time of e xposure or the stage of the disease is not known, a patient with continued symptoms of liver disease despite a completely negative hepatitis panel may need a repeat panel approximately two weeks to two months later to exclude the possibility of hepatitis. Once a diagnosis is established, specific tests can be used to monitor the course of the disease. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan reimburses for Hepatitis Panel/Acute Hepatits Panel (CPT code 80074), when the claim indicates a code found on the list of ap proved diagnosis codes for this test.

Collagen Crosslinks Collagen crosslinks, part of the matrix of bone upon which bone mineral is deposited, are biochemical markers the excretion of which provides a quantitative measurement of bone resorption. Elevated levels of urinary collagen crosslinks indicate elevated bone resorption. Elevated bone resorption contributes to age-related and postmenopausal loss of bone leading to osteoporosis and increased risk of fracture. The collagen crosslinks assay can be performed by immunoassay or by high perform ance liquid chromatography (HPLC). immunoassays measure the pyridinoline crosslinks and associated telopeptides in urine. Bone is constantly undergoing a metabolic process called turnover or remodeling. This includes a degradation proce ss, bone resorption, mediated by the action of osteoclasts, and a building process, bone formation, mediated by the action of osteoblasts. Remodeling is required for the maintenance and overall health of bone and is tightly coupled; that is, resorption and formation must be in balance. In abnormal states of bone remodeling, when resorption exceeds formation, it results in a net loss of bone. The measurement of specific, bone -derived resorption products provides analytical data about the rate of bone resorpt ion. Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to bone fragility and an increased susceptibility to fractures of the hip, spine, and wrist. The term primary osteoporosis is applied wher e the causal factor in the disease is menopause or aging. The term secondary osteoporosis is applied where the causal factor is something other than menopause or aging, such as long -term administration of glucocorticosteroids, endocrine -related disorders ( other than loss of estrogen due to menopause), and certain bone diseases such as cancer of the bone. With respect to quantifying bone resorption, collagen crosslink tests can provide adjunct diagnostic information in concert with bone mass measurements. B one mass measurements and biochemical markers may have complementary roles to play in assessing effectiveness of osteoporosis treatment. Proper management of osteoporosis patients, who are on long -term therapeutic regimens, may include laboratory testing o f biochemical markers of bone turnover, such as collagen crosslinks, that provide a profile of bone turnover responses within weeks of therapy. Changes in collagen crosslinks are determined following commencement of antiresorptive therapy. These can be mea sured over a shorter time interval when compared to bone mass density. If bone resorption is not elevated, repeat testing is not medically necessary. UnitedHealthcare Community Plan reimburses for Collagen Crosslinks Testing (CPT code 82523), when the cla im indicates a code found on the list of approved diagnosis codes for this test.

Digoxin Therapeutic Drug Assay A digoxin therapeutic drug assay is useful for diagnosis and prevention of digoxin toxicity, and/or prevention for under dosage of digoxin. Digoxin levels may be performed to monitor drug levels of individuals receiving digoxin therapy because the margin of safety between side effects and toxicity is narrow or because the blood level may not be high enough to achieve the de sired clinical effect. Clinical indications may include individuals on digoxin: REIMBURSEMENT POLICY CMS -1500 Policy Number 2021R8100 A.LA Proprietary information of UnitedHealthcare Community and State .

In addition, it may be reasonable to check the level if: Heart failure status worsens Renal function deteriorates Additional medications are added that could affect the dig oxin level Signs or symptoms of toxicity develop Steady state will be reached in approximately 1 week in patients with normal renal function, although 2 -3 weeks may be needed in patients with renal impairment. After changes in dosages or the addition of a medication that could affect the digoxin level, it is reasonable to check the digoxin level one week after the change or addition. Based on the clinical situation, in cases of digoxin toxicity, testing may need to be done more than once a week.

Glycated Hemoglobin/Glycated Protein The management of diabetes mellitus requires regular determinations of blood glucose levels. Glycated hemoglobin/protein levels are used to assess long -term glucose control in diabetes. Alternative names for these tests include glycated or glycosylated hem oglobin or Hgb, hemoglobin glycated or glycosylated protein, and fructosamine. Glycated hemoglobin (equivalent to hemoglobin A1) refers to total glycosylated hemoglobin present in erythrocytes, usually determined by affinity or ion -exchange chromatographi c methodology. Hemoglobin A1c refers to the major component of hemoglobin A1, usually determined by ion -exchange affinity chromatography, immunoassay or agar gel electrophoresis. Fructosamine or protein refers to glycosylated protein present in a serum or plasma sample. Glycated protein refers to measurement of the component of the specific protein that is glycated usually by colorimetric method or affinity chromatography. Glycated hemoglobin in whole blood assesses glycemic control over a period o f 4-8 weeks and appears to be the more appropriate test for monitoring a patient who is capable of maintaining long -term, stable control. Measurement may be medically necessary every 3 months to determine whether a patient's REIMBURSEMENT POLICY CMS -1500 Policy Number 2021R8100 A.LA Proprietary information of UnitedHealthcare Community and State .

More frequent assessments, every 1 -2 months, may be appropriate in the patient whose diabetes regimen has been altered to improve control or in whom evidence is present that intercurrent events may have altered a previously satisfactory level of control (for example, post -major surgery or as a result of glucocorticoid therapy). Glycated protein in serum/plasma assesses glycemic control over a period of 1 -2 weeks. It may be reasonable and necessary to monitor glycated protein monthly in pregnant diabetic women. Glycated hemoglobin/protein test results may be low, indicating significant, persistent hypoglycemia, in nesidioblastosis or insulinoma, conditions which are accompanied by inappropriate hyperinsulinemia. A below normal test value is helpful in establishing the patient's hypoglycemic state in those conditions.

UnitedHealthcare Community Plan will not reimburse when the treatment rendered is without inclusion of one of the ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes being included on the claim accurately reflecting the member's c ondition. State Exceptions Louisiana Louisiana Medicaid is excluded from the diagnosis requirement when CPT 84443 is billed for newborns age 0 -28 days based on state requirements for newborn screenings. Definitions Screening The testing for disease or disease precursors so that early detection and treatment can be provided for those who test positive for the disease. Screening tests are performed when no specific sign, symptom, or diagnosis is present and the patient has not b een exposed to a disease. The testing of a person to rule out or to confirm a suspected diagnosis because the patient has a sign and/or symptom is a diagnostic test, not a screening. Questions and Answers 1 Q: What i s a National Coverage Policy? A: A national coverage policy for diagnostic laboratory test(s) is a document stating CMS's policy with respect to the circumstances under which the test(s) will be considered reasonable and necessary, and not screening, for Medicare purposes. Such a policy applies nationwide. A national coverage policy is neither a practice parameter nor a statement of the accepted standard of medical practice.
