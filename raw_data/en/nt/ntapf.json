VUMC uses the definition of disability set forth in Section 504, which states that a disabled person is anyone who: Has a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more major life activities; Has a record of such impairment; Is regarded as having such impairment. Admissions decisions are made using criteria independent of an applicant's disability. Students with disabilities desiring to enroll in a program must be able to meet the admissions standards of VUMC. Specific concerns pertaining to services for people with disabilities or any disability issue should be directed to the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. VUMC will make efforts to provide reasonable accommodation to qualified individuals with disabilities to the extent that such accommodation is readily achievable. Though VUMC takes the needs of student with disabilities seriously, it is not able to guarantee that all services can or will be provided. Specifically, accommodation that is unduly burdensome or fundamentally alters the nature of the service, program or activity may not be provided. In order to receive accommodation, a student must meet the following criteria: Have a documented disability (documentation must be supplied) that presents a significant barrier to the educational process, and Request services by contacting the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. Students are required to provide medical documentation as part of their request for accommodation. All medical information remains confidential and is released to other VUMC personnel only with the student's written permission. Application Procedures All applications and supplemental documents are submitted electronically through the Student Information System (SIS) utilized by the Center for Programs in Allied Health - Orbund. Each program establishes its own admission and application procedures. Please refer to the programspecific admission and application procedures in this Catalog. Minimum Requirements for Admission All applicants must possess a high school diploma, a high school diploma equivalency, a current Tennessee license in the field for which the training is intended, or postsecondary credit in a degree program. If the applicant has a postsecondary degree (i.e., Associate's, Bachelor's or Master's), an official copy of the original college or university diploma, transcript or its equivalent must be provided and verified no later than 30 days after classes commence. The evidence of graduation must include the name of the institution, city, state, and graduation year, and designation of approval by the applicable governing or state authority. VUMC periodically verifies that the institution or program was approved by the applicable governing or state authority. Applicants should speak with the director of the program to which they are applying for more information. Some programs may have additional education requirements for admission. Please check the relevant program section in this catalog for additional information. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 20 Verification of High School Completion If VUMC has reason to suspect an applicant's high school diploma, transcript or other information is fraudulent or not valid, the Assistant Director will investigate the matter. VUMC reserves the right to deny or rescind admission in cases where fraudulence is found. If Administration doubts validity of high school completion, student will be required to submit official high school diploma or transcript with completion date. If student does not produce proof, the Assistant Director will contact the state Department of Education in which the student completed high school for confirmation. If state Department of Education cannot produce proof, the Assistant Director will deny or rescind admission to VUMC. Blended Programs' Admission Requirements (Distance Education) Students applying for blended programs are assessed to ensure they have the appropriate skills and abilities necessary to succeed in the distance education components of these programs. This assessment is administered through Smarter Measure and does not take place until a student is admitted into the program. The assessment is related to the student experience with online learning management systems, in general, as well as general computer and internet experience. Only students who are deemed competent with online systems will be admitted to these programs. Experience with VUMC specific systems is not a requirement, and training in the VUMC Learning Management System is provided early in the student's educational program. Health Insurance All Center for Programs in Allied Health students are required to be covered by health insurance during their training. VUMC does not offer a student health insurance policy. The student must maintain insurance through his/her tenure in the program and must provide proof of insurance (copy of health insurance card or letter from insurer) during new student orientation to the program and annually while enrolled. Background Check All students admitted into VUMC programs are required to undergo a criminal background check prior to matriculation. Applicants are made aware on the application signature page that their VUMC enrollment is conditional upon passing a criminal background check, and instructions regarding the process of obtaining a copy of the background check for the student file are included in the student's letter of admission. VUMC requires that criminal background check reports be delivered by the screening provider directly to VUMC. A criminal record will jeopardize eligibility for employment; therefore, students are advised to review any criminal record concerns with the Program Director prior to deciding to apply. In the event an adverse criminal history report is returned, it is reviewed by the Program Director and the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. The VUMC Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs may also be consulted. Decisions regarding non admission of students deemed unfit due to the information in criminal background reports are final. Individual programs may require additional screening, such as fingerprinting or more extensive background check. Information for any additional required screenings is provided by programs to students at the time of admission. Drug Screen All students admitted into VUMC programs are required to undergo a drug screen prior to matriculation. Applicants are made aware on the application signature page that their VUMC enrollment is conditional upon passing a drug screen. The student will be given a form at orientation to complete the necessary screening within the first 48 hours of the orientation date. Immunization and Health Records Upon acceptance, students must provide documentation of the immunization requirements listed on the Occupational Health website: https://www.vumc.org/health wellness/all aboard/vumc immunization requirements VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 21 Professional Liability Insurance Students enrolled in VUMC programs are covered by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center liability insurance policy. The cost is paid by students as a fee. This coverage is limited only to the care participated in by students at the direction of the Program Director or designee, whether at VUMC or an official clinical education affiliate. Late Enrollment The Center for Programs in Allied Health at Vanderbilt University Medical Center does not allow late enrollment. International Applicants VUMC is not able to admit international students at this time. Green Card holders are not considered International Applicants and are therefore eligible for admission consideration. Instructional Language At VUMC all instruction occurs in English. VUMC does not offer English as a Second Language (ESL) instruction. Applicants whose native language is not English may be required to submit scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing Service (IELTS) as part of the admission process. Programspecific requirements are provided in program sections of this catalog. Foreign Transcript Evaluation Applicants whose prior education was obtained at a nonU.S. Institution are required to submit with the application for admission a full translation of the transcript into U.S. equivalency (i.e., equivalence of credits per course and of degree conferred; translation into English language only is NOT accepted). This translation must be conducted and provided by an independent evaluation provider. The following are examples of foreign transcript and degree evaluators. VUMC does not endorse any evaluators.

Readmission Policy Students dismissed from a VUMC program may be considered for readmission at VUMC on a caseby case basis. Students must apply for admission consideration, and the entire application and selection process must be carried out. Students applying for readmission may be asked to interview with the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. A student may be readmitted to VUMC no more than one time. Reapplying students may be required to repeat coursework taken during a previous period of study at VUMC. The eligibility of coursework previously completed at VUMC to be applied toward graduation requirements following readmission will be determined on an individual basis, and the decision will be based on the following: Length of absence Reason for withdrawal (personal, illness, academic, etc.) Performance in programrecommended/required remediation, if any, during original period of enrollment Whether or not the student was in good academic standing when the withdrawal took place Didactic courses previously completed at VUMC will be considered for credit toward certificate graduation requirements per the VUMC Transfer of Clock Hours or Credit to VUMC Policy. Students may be tested to determine continued mastery of knowledge previously covered in courses. No credit for prior clinical courses, internships, labs or practical is given. Those requirements must be taken regardless of the circumstances of the student withdrawal. Employment Requirements in Allied Health Fields In Allied Health fields, states and employers may require licensure, certification, registration, etc., before an individual may be employed in a given field. Licensure eligibility and other requirements vary from state to state. Students are advised to check licensure and certification guideline specific to their program of study for the states in which they plan to seek employment. Transfer of Clock Hours or Credit to VUMC VUMC evaluates for transfer credit all clock hours and/or credit earned at institutions accredited by organizations recognized by the U.S. Department of Education or the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). Credits earned at other educational institutions are reviewed by VUMC and may or may not be accepted by VUMC as credit toward VUMC programs' graduation requirements. It is the responsibility of prospective students to clearly understand which credits earned at other institutions will and will not be accepted by VUMC before executing an enrollment agreement with VUMC. Clock hour or credit transfer requests must be made by the student in writing during the admissions process. Official evaluation of a collegiate transcript is conducted upon receipt of an official transcript directly from the institution at which the courses under consideration were earned. It is the responsibility of the student to ensure that VUMC receives all official transcripts. An official transcript must be provided from each institution from which credit and/or clock hours are to be transferred. Transcripts provided become the property of VUMC. Up to 25% of program clock hours and/or credit may be accepted for transfer, depending on the determination of equivalency. Only hours or credits for which a grade of C or better was awarded and that were earned within the VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 23 past five years are eligible for transfer consideration. VUMC may ask the student to provide additional documentation to establish coursework completed, and VUMC may require testing and/or demonstration of skills in order to verify student competency related to requested transfer credit/clock hours. Advanced Placement and Experiential Learning VUMC does not accept hours toward advanced placement through challenge examinations, achievement tests, or experiential learning. Transfer of Credits or Clock Hours to Other Institutions Transferability of credits varies considerably from institution to institution. Vanderbilt University Medical Center makes no representation whatsoever regarding transfer or acceptance of VUMC credits by any other institution. Vanderbilt University Medical Center does not guarantee the transferability of its credits to any other institution unless there is a written agreement with another institution explicitly denoting transferability. Transferability of Credit Disclosure You should also contact any educational institutions that you may want to transfer credits earned at VUMC to determine if such institutions will accept credits earned at VUMC prior to executing an enrollment contract or agreement. It is highly recommended, and you are advised, to consult with all educational institutions in which you consider transferring credit earned at VUMC before you execute an enrollment contract or agreement.

Signature of Student Date VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 25 GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS Certificates for each VUMC program are awarded based on the successful completion of all graduation requirements for each program. Details regarding each program's graduation requirements are provided in the programspecific section of this catalog. All programs require students to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, the standards for which are outlined in this Catalog. All students are required by VUMC to complete an exit interview prior to graduation. Also, in order to graduate, students must have no outstanding financial balance with VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health (this does not include educational loans to thirdparty lenders). Satisfactory Academic Progress (Qualitative and Quantitative Elements) All VUMC Students are required to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). SAP is a measure that consists of both qualitative (e.g., grades) and quantitative (e.g., number of hours completed in the clinical setting) measurements. Both measurements are evaluated on a regular basis for each program. Details about the timing and frequency of SAP review for each program are contained in the program specific sections of this catalog. Each program's SAP requirements are also stated within each program section of this catalog. To maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, a student must meet at all times the minimum standards established by each program for both qualitative and quantitative measures. This VUMC Satisfactory Academic Progress policy applies to all VUMC students. These standards are consistently applied by each program to its students, regardless of financial aid status. To graduate, a student must successfully complete all courses in the program with the designated minimum score for passing (which varies from program to program). CPiAH SAP Policy for Both Credit Hour and Clock Hour Programs Qualitative Elements of SAP for Credit Hour Programs All Programs except Dietetic Internship General Information for Credit Hour Programs Qualitative measurement consists of a student's grades, whether expressed numerically or with letter grades (see Grading Scale chart below). Credit hour programs may calculate these grades into a cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA). Some courses may be graded according to the pass/fail system. Some programs use competency based assessment as a qualitative measure in addition to a grading scale. In these cases, student performance of competency related tasks is assessed in order to determine whether or not a student has obtained competency (pass) or not (fail). All credit hour programs adhere to the following grading scale. Qualitative Elements of SAP Grading Scale for Credit Hour Programs Scale Grade GPA 95100% A 4.0 9094% A 3.5 8589% B 3.0 8084% B 2.5 7579% C 2.0 <75% F FAILURE 0 VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 26 P Pass Any course with a \"P\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. F Fail Any course with an \"F\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, the course must be repeated and passed to graduate. I Incomplete May be used at the discretion of the instructor in those cases in which the student is not able to complete work in the normal time. In those instances, the student and instructor develop a written plan for an extension to provide work by a specific date that falls within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements (but in no circumstances greater than one month). An \"I\" that is not replaced by a letter grade within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements, due to unsatisfactory completion of the student's plan, will be changed to an F after the period specified by the program (a period not to exceed one month). Any course with an \"I\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. Once a grade is assigned to the course (when conditions are met that allow for the removal of the \"I\" and assignment of a final grade), that grade will factor into the student's GPA. W\u00b1 Withdrawal - Utilized when a student leaves the course due to an approved leaveofabsence or withdraws from the school prior to the scheduled completion of a course. Any course with a \"W\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. R Repeat Some programs allow students to repeat courses. In those programs, for any course that is repeated, a Repeat will be provided as the grade for the first attempt at the course. Any course with an \"R\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, courses will be considered hours / credit hours attempted for the purpose of determining maximum time frame. Please refer to each program's student handbook for information about whether students are allowed to repeat courses in any given program. \u00b1 Nonpunitive grades for courses awarded by the school include \"W\". Nonpunitive grades are not included in the computation of a student's overall Cumulative Grade or Point Average. The clock hours or credit hours associated with any courses for which nonpunitive grades are assigned are included as credits attempted when calculating the student's Maximum Time Frame and credit completion percentage. Minimum Average Required for Satisfactory Academic Progress for Credit Hour Programs All students enrolled in Credit Hour Programs must maintain a minimum qualitative average (expressed as percentage points, grades, GPA and/or competencies passed) of 75% or a cumulative GPA of 2.0 to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress*. Students must achieve the minimum qualitative average at each review of SAP to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. Students not maintaining SAP will face remedial action, up to and including dismissal from the program. The table below presents the minimum qualitative average required for each program. More detailed information is available in the programspecific section of this catalog for each program. Program Name Term 1 Term 2 Term 3 Term 4 Medical Laboratory Science 75% average 75% average Diagnostic Medical Sonography 75% average 75% average 75% average 75% average 75% average 75% average 75% average *Clock hour programs may have different measurements of SAP and are detailed in the Clock Hour SAP Section below Quantitative Elements of SAP for Credit Hour Programs Students enrolled in credit hour programs must successfully earn annually a cumulative minimum of 2/3 or 66.67% of all hours attempted. Successfully completed hours are earning a letter grade of a C or higher. Some courses may have a specific passing grade requirement. In such cases, the student must earn the specified grade to be considered to have successfully completed the hours. Students cannot receive federal aid after attempting 150% of the hours required for the completion of their academic program. This is referred to as the maximum VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 27 allowable time frame. Example: A degree takes 120 hours to complete, so a student may attempt up to 180 credits (120 x 150% = 180) before being ineligible for federal aid. A student who loses federal aid eligibility because of not meeting SAP will regain eligibility when it is determined that the standards have been met or when an appeal has been approved. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Financial Aid Office of any adjustments in their transcript, and if the student meets the standards, then financial aid will be reinstated.

Minimum Average Required for Satisfactory Academic Progress for Dietetic Internship Program Name Term 1 Term 2 Term 3 Term 4 Dietetic Internship 75% average (rotations & assignments) 75% average (rotations & assignments) Quantitative Elements of SAP for Dietetic Internship For all programs, the quantitative measurement of SAP consists of a student's satisfactory completion of program hours, based on a rateofprogress calculation. The rate of progress calculation is the percentage of total hours completed of those hours the student has attempted. This measurement ensures that all students progress at a rate sufficient to allow them to complete their programs within the maximum time allowed. Each program establishes a number of hours to be attempted and a number required to be completed in order for the student to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. More information is available in each program's section in this catalog, but an outline of program requirements is presented in the following table. Program Name Term 1 Term 2 Term 3 Term 4 Dietetic Internship 600 of 1200 hours completed 600 of 1200 hours completed VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 29 Credit Hour Definitions for All Credit Hour Programs CPiAH adheres to the following definitions and uses the formula in calculating credit hours awarded on a course bycourse basis: Semester Credit Hours (Perfusion, Nuclear Medicine Technology, and Medical Laboratory Science) Semester minimum of 15 weeks in length. One semester credit is equal to: a. one hour of lecture per week for a semester or the equivalent number of hours. b. two hours of lab per week for a semester or the equivalent number of hours. c. three hours of externship/clinical per week for a semester or the equivalent number of hours. Quarter Credit Hours (Diagnostic Medical Sonography) Quarter minimum of 10 weeks in length. One quarter credit is equal to: a. one hour of lecture per week for a quarter or the equivalent number of hours. b. two hours of lab per week for a quarter or the equivalent number of hours. c. three hours of externship/clinical per week for a quarter or the equivalent number of hours. An example of the calculation is as follows: Quarter System Semester System 6 hours lecture = 0.60 6 hours lecture = 0.40 25 hours lab = 1.25 25 hours lab = 0.83 70 hours externship = 2.30 70 hours externship = 1.55 Total = 4.15 Total = 2.78 Rounding occurs following the calculation of the lecture, laboratory, and externship components resulting in a total of 4.0 quarter or 2.5 semester credits when rounded down to the next lowest half or whole number. Partial credits for a course are rounded to the next lowest half or whole number. A course may be comprised of any combination of lecture, laboratory, an/or externship. Care is taken in scheduling breaks. If a program offers both a distance education and a traditional campusbased component, the quality of the education and credit awarded is equivalent in all three aspects of the curriculum: didactic, laboratory, and clinical. CPiAH is aware that federal requirements regarding the calculation of clock and credit hours, including minimum number of weeks per academic year required for Title IV purposes, may vary from ABHES requirements. NonCredit / Remedial Courses / Proficiency Credit - VUMC does not offer noncredit or remedial courses, or grant proficiency credit. Student Grievance Concerning Grades Students should seek redress of a problem with a grade as soon as possible after receiving the grade and in no case later than one (1) week after the grade is released. Students should confer directly with the course director about grade concerns. Every effort should be made to resolve the problem fairly and promptly at this level. If the student cannot resolve the problem through discussion with the course director, the student should formally request an appeal from the Program Director within one (1) week of talking with the course director. If the Program Director is the course director in question, the appeal should be made to the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. The decision of any appeal is final. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 30 Transfer and Readmitted Students/Students Changing Majors If a student transfers to VUMC from another postsecondary institution, the transfer credits that were accepted by VUMC will count as credits attempted and credits completed for purposes of calculating the student's quantitative progress. The corresponding grades will not count toward the student's qualitative progress. If a student is readmitted into VUMC, changes program of study, or seeks to earn an additional credential, the credits that are applicable to the student's current program of study will be included in determining the student's satisfactory academic progress standing and the appropriate evaluation level for the student in terms of establishing the total number of credits attempted and completed at each of the student's evaluation periods. Students receiving federal financial aid may repeat a course in accordance with the VUMC academic policy. Credits from both course attempts will be counted in total credits attempted and in minimum cumulative credits completed at VUMC, but only the highest grade earned will be included in the calculation of minimum cumulative GPA. Credits from both course attempts will also count towards the Maximum Time Frame for Completion. Students may receive financial aid for each repeated course provided that a student may not repeat a passed course more than once. Progress Evaluations and Reports Each student's progress in completing the program is reviewed during a progress evaluation monthly. During these reviews the student's Cumulative Grade (or Point) Average and rate of progress in completing program hours are discussed with the student, and the student receives academic, attendance and/or financial aid advising from the school, as the school deems necessary. Students will receive an electronic progress report containing a summary of the student's grades and successfully completed hours. Students are notified in writing should they fail to meet the minimum standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress during an evaluation period/term. Students who fail to maintain SAP in an evaluation period are placed on SAP Warning, unless there are two or fewer terms left in the program following the term for which the evaluation is provided, in which case the student will be placed on Academic Probation. More information on Academic Probation is contained in the Academic Probation section of this catalog. SAP Warning Each program establishes a timeframe for its SAP warning period, but in no case does a SAP warning period last more than one term. Student loan funds may be disbursed during SAP warning periods. When placed on SAP warning, students are provided notification in writing that outlines the reasons why the student has been placed on SAP warning and the requirements the student must meet in order to be removed from SAP warning (an \"Academic Plan\"). The Academic Plan is designed to bring the student into compliance with Satisfactory Academic Progress standards within a single term. The student's Academic Plan and progress toward its completion will be reviewed with the student during the period of SAP Warning according to the details of the Plan. At the end of the warning period, if the minimum standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress are not met, a student will be placed on Academic Probation. Students who satisfy the conditions of SAP at the end of the Warning period will be returned to Satisfactory Academic Progress status. School personnel, including the appropriate instructor, the Program Director, the Assistant Program Director, and/or the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health are available to discuss any concerns students may have. Academic Probation Students failing to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress as defined by their program may, at the discretion of the program, be placed on academic probation. When placed on academic probation, students are provided written notification that outlines the reasons why the student has been placed on probation and the requirements the student must meet in order to be removed from probation (an \"Academic Plan\"). The Academic VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 31 Plan is designed to bring the student into compliance with Satisfactory Academic Progress standards within a designated period of time as defined by the Program Director. The student's Academic Plan and progress toward completion will be reviewed with the student during the period of Probation according to the details of the Plan. Students are not allowed to have more than one period of probation while enrolled in their program. Students on probation who do not successfully complete the terms of their Academic Plan will be provided the opportunity to withdraw. If the student refuses to withdraw, he or she will be dismissed from the program. Students on probation who successfully complete the terms of their Academic Plan will return to Satisfactory Academic Progress standing, and academic probation status will be removed. Academic Probation Appeal Students who have been placed on academic probation may appeal the probation decision. To do so, the student must submit an appeal request to the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health in writing (email is acceptable) within five (5) working days of being placed on probation. The appeal request must include: Information about the circumstances or events that prevented the student from maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress, and What changed in the student's situation to allow the student to be successful in the future. The student may submit documentation along with the appeal request. The Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health will review and discuss with involved faculty and staff. The student will be notified of the outcome of the appeal in writing within five (5) business days of the appeal submission. The decision of the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health is final. If the appeal is not successful, probation status will continue until 1) the student meets the requirements of the Academic Plan and returns to Satisfactory Academic Progress status, or 2) the student fails to meet the requirements of the Academic Plan and subsequently withdraws or is dismissed from the program. If the appeal is successful, the student will not be placed on probation, but the program may impose requirements the student must complete in order to return to Satisfactory Academic Progress. Student Dismissal Policy Students who have been placed on probation and do not return to Satisfactory Academic Progress status within the time required by their Academic Plan will be given the opportunity to withdraw or be dismissed from the program. Students may also be dismissed from the program after a period of temporary suspension. Students dismissal requires immediate return of student ID, books, equipment or other materials issued by VUMC. VUMC programs pursue dismissal only after a student has been given a reasonable period of warning and/or probation to address deficiencies. Dismissal may also be recommended at any time for a student who demonstrates either a singular egregious behavior or is involved in one or more serious incidents inconsistent with the expectations for students of VUMC, or in violation of VUMC policy. A decision to pursue dismissal requires participation of the program director and relevant program faculty and administrators. The Program Director will meet with the student to hear the student's explanation, including any mitigating circumstances in the situation. The Program Director will then meet with relevant program faculty and administrators to consider factors in the situation and render a determination. The dismissal decision is described in a notice to the student written by the Program Director. This communication is presented to the student, in person whenever possible, by the Program Director, although an inperson meeting may not be possible in all cases. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 32 Student Dismissal Appeal A student who is dismissed from a VUMC program has the right to appeal. Each appeal is decided on an individual basis. The process for appealing a dismissal decision is as follows: The student must submit a written appeal to the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health. The appeal must be submitted at least one month prior to the start of the term in which the student wishes to be granted entrance into the program. Appeals must include a detailed explanation of the circumstances related to the dismissal. As relevant, such appeals should include official/professional documentation (i.e., medical records, court documents, or any other documentation which would support an appeal). The appeal will be reviewed by the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health, and approved or denied based on the student's individual circumstances, past academic record, and potential to successfully complete the program. The Program Director will provide a written decision to the student within fourteen (14) business days. The decision on the dismissal appeal is final. If the student is allowed to reenroll, the Program Director may place conditions that the student must meet in order to be reinstated. The Program Director may also reinstate the student on a probationary basis. Reinstatement is based on class and space availability. If students who are reinstated are required to repeat coursework, that coursework must be satisfactorily completed in order to continue in the program. Reinstated students must maintain VUMC student financial accounts in good standing and may not default on any loan. VUMC reserves the right to terminate a student's enrollment if, during the student's program of study, VUMC determines that the student has failed to maintain the minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress, or has reached the maximum timeframe (150% of the program credits/hours) without successfully completing the program; failed to comply with the VUMC rules and regulations as published in VUMC's Catalog; or has failed to meet their financial obligations. Any refund due to the student or other agencies will be calculated and refunded according to the Tuition Refund Policy. A student who has been dismissed for failure to maintain SAP may reapply for admission; however, until SAP status is reestablished, the student will not be eligible for any form of federal financial aid. A student making application for readmission must first satisfy all current requirements for admission. In addition, if a student's enrollment was terminated for failure to maintain SAP, the applicant's academic records will be evaluated to determine if it is possible for a satisfactory cumulative grade point average to be achieved and if the program can be completed within the maximum time frame. Temporary Student Suspension VUMC reserves the right to temporarily suspend a student for conduct disrupting or otherwise negatively affecting the learning environment, pending consideration of the student's situation by the Program Director and other relevant program faculty and administrators. The Program Director will notify the student in writing of the conditions of the temporary suspension. If the student is reinstated, the student will work with the Program Director to address any course work missed during the suspension. Maximum Time to Complete Program All students are expected to complete their program of study within an acceptable period of time, as defined by each program, but in no case to exceed 150% of normal program length. Students failing to complete their program of study within the maximum time will be dismissed from the program. These students are not eligible for reinstatement. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 33 Time spent in any of the following situations/activities counts toward the maximum time to complete VUMC programs: Courses for which a grade of incomplete or failure was recorded Courses from which the student withdrew Repeated coursework (e.g., following prior failure of the course) Time in a VUMCapproved leaveofabsence. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 34 STUDENT POLICIES Attendance Attendance is an essential component of success in VUMC programs. Students enrolled at the institution make a commitment to participate fully in their education by attending classes, clinical rotations, and other educational activities as required by their program of study, and accounting for any absences according to program policy. Each program establishes its detailed tardiness, absence and makeup time policies and procedures. Please refer to the programspecific Program Handbook for more information. Clock hour programs are required to complete all specified clock hours to successfully complete their program of study. Refer to the specific program sections for number of clock hours required for completion. It is the student's responsibility to address any issues related to his/her attendance. The Program Director and the instructor/preceptor will meet to determine the number of hours required to be made up by the student to meet graduation requirements. All programs have processes to allow for absence in cases of emergency, of illness, of the death of a close relative, or when observing a religious holiday. See programspecific information in this catalog for further details. Each program has policies regarding unexcused consecutive absences and consequences for such, up to and including dismissal from the program. Leaves of Absence VUMC offers students the option to take a leave of absence from study at VUMC for medical, family or other reasons. Students must request the leave of absence in advance, except in emergency cases. The student must submit a written request to Program Director, indicating the beginning and ending dates of the leave. Additional documentation to support the request may be required (e.g., medical records, legal records). Each student's request is evaluated on an individual, casebycase basis. A student may be granted a leave of absence not to exceed a total of 180 calendar days in a 12month period. Students may take no more than one leave of absence while enrolled in a VUMC program. Time spent in a VUMC approved leaveofabsence counts toward the maximum allowable time to complete any VUMC program. Exceptions cannot be made to each program's maximum time for completion (150% of normal program length) for student leaveofabsence or for any other reason. Academic plans are developed to accommodate students' needs upon returning from leave of absence. At the discretion of the Program Director, students returning from a leave of absence may be required to complete coursework in a different academic year than the one in which they matriculated. Students may be required to present medical documentation in order to return from medical leaveofabsence. If a student does not return on the documented return date, they may be dismissed from the program. Students who are eligible to register in the term following the leave but do not do so may be unenrolled and may be required to reapply to the program. Programs may require students to complete some or all coursework, clinical rotations and other educational activities. Time spent in leaveofabsence counts toward the maximum time allowed to complete VUMC programs. It is the student's responsibility to be aware of these limits for the program in which the student is enrolled.

The following is a summary of Tennessee and federal sanctions for the unlawful use of illicit drugs and alcohol. While the summary is a good faith effort to provide information, VUMC does not guarantee that it is an errorfree or exhaustive accounting. Under federal law, a civil penalty of up to $100,000 and imprisonment of up to one year may be imposed for simple possession of certain specified controlled substances. Possession of crack cocaine may lead to civil penalties of up to $250,000 and imprisonment of up to twenty years. Also, possession of a controlled substance can result in the denial of federal benefits, such as student loans, grants, contracts and professional and commercial licenses, and the forfeiture of personal property and real estate used to transport, conceal or facilitate such possession. In addition, possession of a controlled substance can lead to ineligibility to receive or purchase a firearm. Under federal law, it is unlawful to manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver, sell or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, dispense, deliver or sell controlled substances. The penalty imposed depends upon many factors that include the type and amount of controlled substance involved; the number or prior offenses, if any; whether death or serious bodily harm resulted from the use of such substance; and whether any other crimes were committed in connection with the use of the controlled substance. Even a firsttime violation can result in life imprisonment; a fine of up to $4,000,000 per individual; supervised release; or any combination of these penalties. These sanctions are doubled when the offense involves either: (1) distribution or possession at or near a school or university campus, or (2) distribution to persons under 21 years of age. Repeat offenders may face greater penalties. Under Tennessee law, it is unlawful for any person under the age of 21 to buy, possess, transport (unless in the course of their employment) or consume alcoholic beverages, including wine or beer. It is unlawful for any adult to buy alcoholic beverages for or furnish them for any purpose to anyone under 21 years of age. These offenses are classified Class A Misdemeanors punishable by imprisonment for not more than eleven months and twenty nine days or a fine of not more than $2,500 or both. The offense of public intoxication is a Class A Misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of not more than thirty days or a fine of not more than $50 or both. Under Tennessee law, the offense of possession or casual exchange of a controlled substance (such as marijuana) is punishable as a Class A Misdemeanor (eleven months, twentynine days and/or a fine of $2,500). For the third and subsequent offense of possession of \u00bd oz. or less of marijuana, punishment is one to six years of imprisonment and a $3,000 fine. If there is an exchange from a person over 21 years of age to a person under 21 and the older person is at least two years older than the younger and the older person knows that the younger person is under 21, then the offense is classified as a felony. Possession of more than \u00bd oz. of marijuana under circumstances where intent to resell may be implicit is punishable by one to six years of imprisonment and a $5,000 fine for the first offense. Maximum Tennessee penalties for possession, manufacture or distribution of substantial quantities of a controlled substance range from fifteen to sixty years of imprisonment and up to a $500,000 fine. The State of Tennessee may, under certain circumstances, impound a vehicle used to transport or conceal controlled substances. Weapons Policy Vanderbilt University Medical Center prohibits student possession of firearms or other dangerous weapons while on Vanderbilt University Medical Center Campus or at clinical affiliations. Any student found to be in violation of this policy will be subject to disciplinary action. If a student receives information or observes another individual, staff member or patient/family, possessing a firearm or dangerous weapon on one of the previously mentioned campuses he/she should report this immediately to a Clinical Instructor or another staff member in authority. Firearms and other weapons are prohibited at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), except by Law Enforcement Officers as defined by T.C.A. \u00a7 39 171350(d).

This includes any activity that would cause VUMC to not be in compliance with state or federal law Social Media Policy This policy is intended for internet activities that associate or identify VUMC personnel with VUMC, use VUMC email addresses, or discusses VUMC. In keeping with the Electronic Communications and Information Technology Resources policy (HR025), VUMC email addresses should not be used in conjunction with unofficial or personal social media accounts and profiles. This policy is not intended to guide online communications when students do not associate or identify themselves with VUMC. Online social media allows VUMC personnel to engage in professional and personal conversations. These guidelines apply to VUMC employees (including faculty, staff, students and house staff) who identify themselves with VUMC in social medical venues such as professional society blogs, LinkedIn, and/or Facebook, for deliberate professional engagement or casual conversation. Because of the evolving nature of social media platforms, these guidelines do not attempt to name every current and emerging platform. Rather, they apply to those cited and any other online platform available and emerging, including social networking sites and sites with usergenerated content. Examples include, but are not limited to the following: a. You Tube; b. Facebook; c. Instagram; d. TikTok; e. LinkedIn; f. Twitter; g. Blogs; and h.

If VUMC employees (faculty, staff, students and house staff) identify themselves as a member of VUMC in any online forum, they make it clear that they are not speaking for VUMC, and what they say represents their individual personal views and opinions and not necessarily the views and opinions of VUMC. This can be VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 41 accomplished by including the phrase \"views my own\" in the social account bio information. Personal social media handles and avatars/profile images should not include any of Vanderbilt University's registered marks, including logos or the words Vanderbilt, VUMC, Vandy, a V that clearly implies Vanderbilt or other iterations. 3. VUMC students are thoughtful about how they present themselves in online networks. By virtue of identifying oneself as a part of VUMC in such a network, students connect themselves to, and reflect upon, VUMC colleagues, managers, VUMC patients and donors, and the health care and biomedical research professions. 4. Remember that all content contributed on all platforms becomes immediately searchable and can be immediately shared. This content immediately leaves the contributing individual's control forever. 5. If someone or some group offers to pay a student for participating in an online forum in their VUMC role, and/or offers advertising for pay and/or for endorsement, this could constitute conflict of interest, and VUMC policies and guidelines apply. If a member of VUMC's workforce is compensated financially or in product as an \"influencer,\" this should be discussed with their supervisor or department chair (in case of faculty) to avoid a conflict of interest. 6. If someone from the media or press contacts about posts made in online forums that relate to Vanderbilt University or VUMC in any way, students alert their manager/leadership and contact VUMC News & Communications before responding. 7. If a patient or family member posts complaints about service or other issues, contact Strategic Marketing's social media team via direct message: on Twitter @VUMCHealth or on Facebook/Instagram @VanderbiltHealth. 8. Job postings follow VUMC's Human Resources (HR) established processes. Social Media may be used to share postings with individuals' professional networks but may not be used in place of HR processes but may be used to share official job postings with personal networks. VUMC Emergency Preparedness Students are introduced to VUMC emergency response policies and plans at orientation, and they are required to be familiar with and follow policies at all times. The VUMC Emergency Preparedness Guide may be found in the Program Director's office and throughout the hospital. While assigned at the Medical Center, students are expected to respond appropriately to any emergency in a timely and appropriate manner. The Medical Center Safety Guidelines may be accessed at https://www.vumc.org /emergency/welcome . Emergency preparedness policies and procedures are discussed during student orientation. The following is a brief description of emergency codes that student may hear announced at the medical center: STAT medical emergency defined by location. RED alert Fire condition If the fire is in the immediate area - respond with R.A.C.E/P.A.S.S. If the fire is not in the immediate area - close doors and hallways and keep patients and visitors within the area. Code Black - bomb threat Code Silver - active shooter Code Pink - Missing infant (<1 years old) identified by location and description Code Purple - Missing child (112 years old) identified by location and description.

VUMC Exposure and Infection Control Policy Students enrolled at VUMC will be at risk for exposure to potentially hazardous material, chemicals and blood borne pathogens or other workrelated injury. Occupational exposure occurs when there is a puncture, scratch, laceration, splash, prolonged skin contact or contact with broken skin involving blood, body fluids, or other potentially infectious materials. Among the hazards that a student may be exposed to are: Housekeeping and/or cleaning agents Flammable and/or explosive chemicals and gases Electrical or mechanical equipment Fumes Radiation Bloodborne pathogens Students will be instructed in the use of infection control and standard precautions, as well as safety in the workplace. If exposure or injury does occur during scheduled clinical education time, the student should follow the documented procedure for treatment. 1. Report the exposure/injury to the supervising staff IMMEDIATELY. 2. Take appropriate first aid measures (clean wound with soap/water; flush mucous membranes with water/saline for 15 minutes). If lifethreatening, see Emergency Department (ED) physician immediately. If nonlife threatening, seek treatment at the Occupational Health Clinic in the Medical Arts Building. If after hours, seek treatment in the ED. 3. Get the name, medical record number and location of the exposure source, if the source is a patient. 4. Notify the Program Director. 5. Complete the Tennessee First Report of Injury and forward to Risk Management within 48 hours. 6. It is the student's responsibility to report any exposure/injury to their instructor and Program Director. Any identified incident found not to be reported may result in disciplinary action, up to or including dismissal from the program. Infection Control for Patients During their normal program activities students will encounter patients who are in an immunosuppressed condition, putting these patients at a particularly high risk of contracting infectious diseases, including a cold, influenza and other communicable diseases. To some patients such an infection could be life threatening. Because of this, if a student suspects he or she has acquired (or if he or she has been diagnosed with) an infectious condition, the student is prohibited from the clinical setting. This is absolutely essential in order to protect patients from infection by ill students. Any infectious condition should be reported by the student to the Program Director as soon as possible.

VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 46 AntiHarassment, Nondiscrimination, and AntiRetaliation Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) is an Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action Employer. VUMC's Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Policy is reflected in the following statements (full policy is available online, at https://hr.vumc.org/policies/anti harassment It is important that Vanderbilt University Medical Center (\"VUMC\") faculty, staff and students enjoy an environment free from implicit and explicit behavior used to control, influence, or affect the wellbeing of any member of the VUMC community. Harassment of or discrimination against individuals based on their race, sex, religion, color, national or ethnic origin, age, disability, veteran status, or genetic information or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, or state law is unacceptable and grounds for disciplinary action, and also constitutes a violation of federal and/or state law. Equally unacceptable within VUMC is the harassment of or discrimination against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. For purposes of this policy, harassment is any verbal or physical conduct designed to threaten, intimidate or coerce an employee, student, coworker or any person working for or on behalf of VUMC. Verbal taunting (including racial and ethnic slurs) that, in the students opinion, impairs his or her ability to perform his or her job is included in the definition of harassment. Sexual Harassment Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination. It is illegal under state and federal law and is a violation of VUMC policy. Sexual harassment is prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX of the Education Amendment of 1972, and other applicable federal and state laws. Sexual harassment may take different forms. The following examples of sexual harassment are intended to be guidelines and are not exclusive when determining whether there has been a violation of this policy: Verbal sexual harassment may include, without limitation, innuendoes, suggestive comments, jokes of a sexual nature, sexual propositions, lewd remarks and threats; requests for any type of sexual favor (this includes repeated, unwelcome requests for dates); and verbal abuse or \"kidding\" that is oriented toward a prohibitive form of harassment, including that which is sexual in nature and unwelcome. Nonverbal sexual harassment may include, without limitation, the distribution, display or discussion of any written or graphic material, including calendars, posters and cartoons that are sexually suggestive or show hostility toward an individual or group because of sex; suggestive or insulting sounds; leering; staring; whistling; obscene gestures; content in letters and notes, facsimiles, email, photos, text messages, tweets and Internet postings; or other form of communication that is sexual in nature and offensive. Physical sexual harassment may include, without limitation, unwelcome, unwanted physical contact, including touching, tickling, pinching, patting, brushing up against, hugging, cornering, kissing and fondling and forced sexual intercourse or assault. The Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Education sets forth sexual harassment under Title IX as conduct can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature by an employee, by another student, or by a third party that is sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive to limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from an education program or activity, or to create a hostile or abusive educational environment. Racial and Other Harassment in the Work Environment Harassment against individuals on the basis of their race, color, religion, or national origin is a form of unlawful discrimination and is prohibited under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other applicable federal and state laws. When harassment based on an individual's race, color, religion, or national origin has the \"purpose or VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 47 effect of substantially interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment,\" it rises to the level of unlawful discrimination. In addition, these principles apply to harassment on the basis of age, disability, leave status and genetic information under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, respectively. Finally, VUMC, through its nondiscrimination statement, applies these principles to harassment on the basis of an individual's sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. The following examples of harassment are intended to be guidelines and are not exclusive when determining whether there has been a violation of this policy: Verbal harassment includes comments that are offensive or unwelcome regarding a person's nationality, origin, race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, body, disability or appearance, including epithets, slurs and negative stereotyping. Nonverbal harassment includes distribution, display or discussion of any written or graphic material that ridicules, denigrates, insults, belittles or shows hostility, aversion or disrespect toward an individual or group because of national origin, race, color, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, pregnancy, appearance, disability, sexual identity, marital or other protected status. Discrimination Discrimination against individuals based on their race, sex, religion, color, national or ethnic origin, age, disability, veteran status, genetic information sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, or state law is unacceptable and grounds for disciplinary action, and also constitutes a violation of federal and state laws. Retaliation In compliance with the law, VUMC does not retaliate against individuals for 1) filing or encouraging one to file a complaint of unlawful discrimination or report of illegal activity, 2) participating in an investigation of unlawful discrimination, or 3) opposing unlawful discrimination. In addition, the VUMC does not retaliate against individuals for filing or encouraging one to file a complaint of discrimination, participating in an investigation of discrimination, or opposing discrimination based on grounds not necessarily protected by federal or state law, but protected by the VUMC's nondiscrimination policy such as sexual orientation. \"Retaliation\" includes any adverse employment action or act of revenge against an individual for filing or encouraging one to file a complaint of discrimination, participating in an investigation of discrimination, or opposing discrimination. Complaint Procedure Any member of the VUMC community who experiences harassment or discrimination on the basis of his or her race, sex, religion, color, national or ethnic origin, age, disability, veteran status, military status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression should immediately seek assistance from CPiAH administration/student services support. FERPA Rights (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) VUMC respects the rights and privacy of its students and acknowledges the responsibility to maintain confidentiality of personally identifiable information. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law that affords students certain rights with respect to their educational records. FERPA defines the rights of students to review their records, request a change to their records, and provide written consent to disclose personally identifiable information to a third party. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. The following link provides further information about FERPA: https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen /guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 48 The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), also referred to as \"The Buckley Amendment\", afford eligible students certain rights with respect to their education records. (An \"eligible student\" under FERPA is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution.) These rights include: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Center for Programs in Allied Health receives a request for access. A student should submit to the VUMC CPiAH office a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The school official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the school official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student's privacy rights under FERPA. A student who wishes to ask the school to amend a record should write the school official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record the student wants changed and specify why it should be changed. If the school decides not to amend the record as requested, the school will notify the student in writing of the decision and the student's right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to provide written consent before the VUMC discloses personally identifiable information (PII) from the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act provides the VUMC the ability to designate certain student information as \"directory information.\" Directory information may be made available to any person without the student's consent unless the student gives notice as provided for below. VUMC CPiAH has designated the following as directory information: the student's name, addresses, telephone number, email address, date and place of birth, field of study, school, classification, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, the most recent previous educational agency or institution attended by the student, and other similar information. Any new entering or currently enrolled student who does not wish disclosure of directory information should notify their Program Director in writing. No element of directory information as defined above is released for students who request nondisclosure except in situations required by law. The request to withhold directory information will remain in effect as long as the student continues to be enrolled, or until the student files written request with their Program Director to discontinue the withholding. To continue nondisclosure of directory information after a student cease to be enrolled, a written request for continuance must be filed with their Program Director during the student's last term of attendance. If a student believes VUMC has failed to comply with The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, he or she may file a formal written complaint with the Center for Programs in Allied Health, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, B802 TVC, 1301 22nd Avenue, Nashville, TN 372325510. The complaint will be investigated by the Director of the Center for Programs in Allied Health, and the requesting student will be notified of the outcome of the investigation. Students may also file a written complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, DC 202125920. FERPA permits the disclosure of PII from students' education records, without consent of the student, if the disclosure meets certain conditions found in \u00a799.31 of the FERPA regulations. Except for disclosures to school officials, disclosures related to some judicial orders or lawfully issued subpoenas, disclosures of directory information, and disclosures to the student, \u00a799.32 of FERPA regulations requires the institution to record the disclosure.

F Fail Any course with an \"F\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, the course must be repeated and passed to graduate. I Incomplete May be used at the discretion of the instructor in those cases in which the student is not able to complete work in the normal time. In those instances, the student and instructor develop a written plan for an extension to provide work by a specific date that falls within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements (but in no circumstances greater than one month). An \"I\" that is not replaced by a letter grade within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements, due to unsatisfactory completion of the student's plan, will be changed to an F after the period specified by the program (a period not to exceed one month). Any course with an \"I\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. Once a grade is assigned to the course (when conditions are met that allow for the removal of the \"I\" and assignment of a final grade), that grade will factor into the student's GPA. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 66 W\u00b1 Withdrawal - Utilized when a student leaves the course due to an approved leaveofabsence or withdraws from the school prior to the scheduled completion of a course. Any course with a \"W\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. R Repeat Some programs allow students to repeat courses. In those programs, for any course that is repeated, a Repeat will be provided as the grade for the first attempt at the course. Any course with an \"R\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, courses will be considered hours / credit hours attempted for the purpose of determining maximum time frame. Please refer to each program's student handbook for information about whether students are allowed to repeat courses in any given program. Each course syllabus clearly delineates how final grades are calculated. Students who do not complete required work or hours in a course will be assigned a failing grade for the course. Student Clinical Assessment The DMS Program Clinical Education Plan guides student clinical assessment, and is divided into the following two (2) sections of required clinical performance evaluations: 1. Technical Competencies These are unique skill sets, outlined in the DMS Program Technical Competencies Plan, which appears in the DMS Program Handbook. The technical competencies provide a pathway for progressive skill development from basic patient care and portions of abdominal, gynecological, and obstetrical exams to complete exams and advanced imaging skills. Each technical competency must be practiced multiple times during the student's time in the program, with observation and rating by credentialed clinical staff (preceptors). Variable levels of assistance by the preceptor are permitted, but students must meet the minimum requirements of competence, as described in the Technical Evaluation Criteria table, which also appears in the Program Handbook. Specific deadlines for successfully completing the required number of technical competencies are specified in each clinical syllabus. 2. Technical Competency Challenges In addition to achieving the required technical competencies as described above, the student is required to pass Technical Competency Challenges during each clinical practicum in order to document progressive entry level skill development and complete satisfactory clinical requirements. Technical Competency Challenge requirements are described in the DMS Program Handbook. Technical Competency Challenges may be performed only after 70% of assigned Technical Competencies are satisfactorily completed. Technical Competency Challenges may only be completed with designated, appropriately credentialed clinical staff (Clinical Instructors). Minimal levels of assistance are permitted (as described in the Technical Evaluation Criteria table). Students who are not successful in completing a Technical Competency Challenge must complete additional repetitions of the competency and consult with the clinical coordinator before he or she may repeat the Technical Competency Challenge. Two unsuccessful attempts at the same Technical Competency Challenge will result in the student being placed on SAP Warning, and the implementation of a written plan of action required for the student to return to satisfactory academic status. Timely performance of Technical Competency Challenges is required, and failure to meet Challenges by the dates specified in each clinical syllabus will affect Clinical course grades. Entry level skills and competence are determined in the last Rotation of clinical coursework through the Final Competency Assessment with designated, appropriately credentialed Clinical Instructors. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 67 Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy (SAP) A student is considered to be maintaining satisfactory academic progress if he/she 1) maintains a 75% academic average in all didactic and clinical courses throughout each curriculum Rotation (12 weeks); 2) maintains a satisfactory performance pace (completion of hours required) within the curriculum course sequence and clinical competency plan, per the course syllabi; and 3) complies with all program policies found in this catalog and in the Program Handbook. Performance will be monitored in an ongoing manner throughout activities and a grade for each course assessed at the end of each Rotation. Code of Conduct and Ethics In addition to the VUMC Code of Conduct, students in the Diagnostic Medical Sonography Program are bound by standards of conduct specific to their profession. Adherence to the VUMC Code of Conduct and the SDMS Professional Code of Ethics is required of students at all times. SDMS Professional Code of Ethics The Society of Diagnostic Medical Sonography (SDMS) was founded in 1970 to promote, advance, and educate its members and the medical community in the science of diagnostic medical sonography. The SDMS is a network of over 28,000 sonographers practicing in all specialty areas, sonography students, educators, physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers who practice or have an interest in diagnostic medical sonography. Code of Ethics for the Profession of Diagnostic Medical Sonography Reapproved by SDMS Board of Directors, February 18, 2017. PREAMBLE The goal of this code of ethics is to promote excellence in patient care by fostering responsibility and accountability among diagnostic medical sonographers.

Society of Diagnostic Medical Sonography, https://www.sdms.org/about/who weare/codeofethics Graduation/Completion Requirements Students of the VUMC Diagnostic Medical Sonography Program are required to do the following in order to graduate with a Certificate in General Sonography: VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 69 1. Complete all didactic and clinical coursework in the Curriculum Plan with a grade of \"C\" or better as outlined in the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy. 2. Complete all assigned technical competencies as outlined in the Clinical Competency Plan. 3. Demonstrate competency in technical ability by successfully completing all assigned competency challenges as outlined in the Clinical Competency Plan, including the Final Competency Assessment. 4. Complete all assigned hours in accordance with the Attendance Policy. 5. Satisfactorily complete an original research project and perform a 10minute presentation for the clinical staff of the VUMC Ultrasound Section. (An opportunity will be available to conduct this research and present it in competition or scientific paper presentation as a group project.) 6. Submit documentation for a total of twelve (12) hours of approved professional development activities. Upon satisfaction of these requirements, each student is required to participate in an Exit Interview with the Program Director prior to the release of a certificate or transcript. Other Program Policies Professional Progression, Career Advising Each student enrolled in the VUMC DMS Program has access to faculty and staff members for academic and professional advising. The Program Director and/or the Clinical Coordinator are the primary sources for this type of student advising; however, the student may approach other faculty members, clinical instructors or staff of the VUMC Ultrasound and/or Radiology Department. The Student Support Services Manager in the Center for Programs in Allied Health is also available by appointment to assist students as necessary. All official academic advising conducted by program faculty and staff is documented and retained in the student's record. Employment Placement for Program Graduates The DMS Program's accreditor (CAAHEP) requires reporting of outcomes and achievement of designated outcomes pertaining to graduate placement in a related position of employment. The DMS Program assumes that all graduates desire to obtain employment within a relative short time beyond graduation (if a position is not secured prior to graduation). While VUMC does not guarantee employment offers or engage in job searches for students, Program Faculty and Staff can offer assistance and advising related to searching for a position. There are numerous ways the program can assist a selfdriven student to secure employment. These include, but are not limited to: Notification to students about available positions Review and feedback on resume development Provide resources for conducting job searches Provide references and/or academic verification Since the DMS Program is required to report information on student employment placement to the accrediting bodies, graduates are asked to provide detailed information regarding employment. Necessary information will be requested at the Exit Interview. If the student has not yet obtained employment, he or she will be expected to provide the information as soon as it becomes available. VUMC will contact graduates regarding employment status in order to fulfill accreditation reporting requirements. Employment information (including changes) is needed by the program for the first 12 calendar months beyond graduation. Compliance with this request is necessary for outcomes documentation and distribution of graduate and employer surveys. Certification/Credentialing/National Examination/State Licensure VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 70 The DMS Program's accreditor (CAAHEP) requires reporting of program outcomes and achievement of designated benchmarks. Graduate credentialing rates are among the numerous outcomes assessed. CAAHEP requires reporting for all eligible specialties. The Program exhausts all efforts to provide students with the information and resources necessary to be successful at professional credentialing exams. The ARDMS has transitioned over the past few years to permit students attending accredited programs the opportunity to apply and take these credentialing exams prior to graduation from the program. While a student may successfully complete the exams prior to graduation, the credential is not released until the Program Director indicates successful completion of the program (see Graduation Requirements). In order to earn the RDMS (Registered Diagnostic Medical Sonographer) credential, one must successfully complete the Sonography Principles and Instrumentation (SPI) exam AND a corresponding Specialty exam (i.e., Abdomen, Obstetrics/Gynecology, etc.). VUMC is accredited as a General an Abdominal sonography extended and Obstetrics and gynecology sonography program that deems its students eligible to apply for and earn the RDMS credential in Abdomen and Obstetrics/Gynecology. This credentialing process results in one (1) credential in two (2) specialties. These exams may be taken while still enrolled in the program under the following parameters: Sonography Principles and Instrumentation may be taken immediately upon satisfactory completion of the Physics coursework Specialty exams (Abdomen and Obstetrics/Gynecology) may be applied for and taken within the last sixty (60) days of the Academic Calendar While the DMS Program is required by its accreditors to achieve high rates of student credentialing, it is of utmost importance to the student that appropriate credentials are obtained in the search for employment. Few employers hire graduates prior to being credentialed, but they often offer employment with a condition of obtaining certain credentials. The Program Faculty and Staff expect that VUMC students, as leaders in their field, pursue the full credentialing for which they are eligible prior to and upon graduation. Students are advised that while the DMS Program provides an introduction to the Vascular Technology specialty, the program does NOT have the clinical resources to ensure proficiency in the full spectrum of vascular examinations. However, with the foundation of knowledge gained at VUMC, many graduates have secured employment that provided the necessary additional training to prepare for the RVT (Registered Vascular Technologist) credential. A graduate can earn the RVT after gaining additional clinical training and experience, and subsequently successfully completing the Vascular Technology (VT) Specialty Exam. Additional details are available from the Program Director for those interested.

There are 3 steps to the complete application process: VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 76 1) Complete and submit the online application located in the DICAS portal (https://portal.docas.org ) between 12/2022 and 2/15/2023 2) Complete a VUMC supplemental application (using a link provided on the VUMC Dietetic Internship website) and an application fee of $75 payable to VUMC by 2/15/2023 3) Rank dietetic internship choices by 2/15/2023 using the national D & D Digital computer matching service; https://www.dnddigital.com/ Student Selection and Acceptance A selection committee, consisting of preceptors, internship faculty, and current interns, reviews online applications. Each committee member individually considers GPA, extracurricular activities, work/volunteer experience, personal statement and references. Applicants must participate in computer matching that is managed by D & D Digital Systems. The online matching process aligns applicant internship preferences with internship selection of candidates. VUMC will not notify students of acceptance. D & D Digital Systems will notify each applicant about the dietetic internship program to which he or she has been \"matched.\" On match or appointment day, the applicant must confirm acceptance of the internship assignment with the VUMC Dietetic Internship Program Director via email on the designated date (which is established by D & D Digital Systems). Academic Program and Assessment Program Sequence and Delivery The 44week, fulltime VUMC dietetic internship begins in August with a threeweek orientation and concludes in June. Following the three week orientation for 18 interns: 8 interns complete 14 weeks of disease management rotations + 2 weeks of entry level practice in disease management and 8 interns complete 14 weeks of health promotion rotations + 2 weeks of entry level practice in health promotion At midpoint of the dietetic internship (January), Interns previously in disease management rotations, transition into 14 weeks of health promotion rotations + 2 weeks of entry level practice in health promotion and Interns previously in health promotion rotations, transition into 14 weeks of disease management rotations + 2 weeks of entry level practice in disease management At the completion of health promotion and disease management rotations, 18 students transition into a 3 week concentration rotation. Successful completion of this rotation confirms their ability to practice as an entry level dietitian in disease management health promotion practice settings. Professional Development Days are typically scheduled on most Fridays throughout the internship and include presentations by preceptors and interprofessional teams. Supervised practice and professional development day schedules are designed around 8hour schedules. Additional professional development experiences (i.e. qualitative research, clinic based nutrition care, community presentations, and interprofessional teaming) contribute to the overall total hours.

The performance levels for the practice domains are: Scale Definition Needs much improvement Needs assistance on many projects; requires guidance to achieve pre determined objectives Approaching entry level Performs all activities with some assistance; generally, achieves predetermined objectives Entry level Performs all activities correctly; works w/minimum assistance once guidelines are established; meets predetermined objectives Beyond entry level Performs all activities w/great accuracy; works independently once guidelines are established; exceeds predetermined objectives Internship Faculty translate preceptor professional assessment scale into objective scores as follows: Scale Grade Needs much improvement 60 = F Approaching entry level 75 = C Entry level 85 = B Beyond entry level 100 = A Professional development experiences are evaluated by Internship Faculty. These experiences enrich job ready skills development in disease management health promotion practice settings. Competency based experiences may include: Professional Development Day (classes include simulations, case studies, role playing, seminar presentations Research & Development of a Clinical Case Study and Online Business Model VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 78 Interprofessional Case Collaborations Interprofessional Community Service Collaborations Qualitative Research and Poster Presentations Internship Leadership CoChair Overall scores for each rotation and professional development programming are determined utilizing rubrics and objective scores from core competencies (60%) and subjective performance ratings (40%). The grading scales detailed above apply to rotation and professional development programming. At program completion , a minimum overall score of 85 must be achieved to meet requirements for receipt of a Verification Statement. The score of 85 indicates \"entry level performs all activities correctly; works w/minimum assistance once guidelines are established; meets predetermined objectives\" After each rotation , students review competency grading forms during individual evaluation conferences with rotation preceptors. Students review scores on written projects, objective scores for core competencies and subjective performance ratings for professional behavior and readiness for entry level practice. The rotation grade is 60% objective (i.e. based on written projects) and 40% subjective (i.e. based on professional performance behavior and readiness to practice). If a project score is below 70, an alternative project is assigned and scored by the Internship Faculty; in consultation with the preceptor. If a student submits work late (beyond the documented and/or renegotiated due date), a minimum of 5 points per day is deducted from the earned score. If an intern earns an overall rotation score of less than 75 in one rotation, the intern will meet with the Internship Director and Educational Coordinator(s) to prepare a written action plan for improvement to meet competency within a specified time period, depending on the learning needs of the intern, and within the 44 week program. Failure to achieve a minimum score of 75 in a second rotation will result in the intern being placed on academic probation. Midinternship (January) students are required to have an overall average score of 75; which translates to \"approaching entry level.\" The midinternship overall score for rotations is determined utilizing rubrics and objective scores from core competencies (60%) and subjective performance ratings (40%). Professional development experiences are evaluated by Internship Faculty and reviewed individually with interns. Competency based experiences include: seminars, clinical case study/online business model, interprofessional case collaborations, community service, qualitative research/poster presentations and cochair leadership. Overall scores for professional development experiences are determined utilizing rubrics and objective scores from core competencies (60%) and subjective performance ratings (40%). Grade information is accessible to students at any time in the student online learning management system (Canvas). Conferences may be scheduled at any time by the Internship Faculty or at the students' request. At program completion , a minimum overall score of 85 must be achieved to meet requirements for receipt of a Verification Statement. Internship Faculty meet with each student during summary week to summarize performance in the 44week internship program. Failure to achieve a final overall average score of 85 will result in termination prior to or at the summary week conference. VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 79 Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) SAP Standards VUMC Dietetic Interns are required to maintain established program standards of competence and knowledge. Students are evaluated on a numerical rating scale (based on 100 points) by the rotation site preceptor. Additionally, Internship Faculty evaluate student professional development experiences using the same numerical rating scale (based on 100 points). The student is considered as maintaining satisfactory academic progress if he/she maintains a minimum average score of 75% in rotations and as indicated below in these additional categories: Rotations in disease management health promotion >=75% Required for each rotation Required midyear grade >=75% Overall grade required at midyear for continuance in the program Program completion - average in each domain >=85% Overall average grade required at program completion in practice domain categories IIV Program completion -domain V >=85% Overall average grade required at program completion in practice domain category V. Program completion - total overall average >=85% Required at completion of internship; overall composite percentage out of 100 points. If an intern earns an overall rotation score of less than 75 in one rotation, the intern will meet with the Internship Director and Educational Coordinator(s) to prepare a written action plan for improvement to meet competency within a specified time period, depending on the learning needs of the intern, and within the 44week program. Failure to achieve a minimum score of 75 in a second rotation will result in the intern being placed on academic probation. Failure to return to satisfactory academic progress status after being placed on academic probation within the time required by the intern's written action plan for improvement may result in dismissal from the program.

Once a grade is assigned to the course (when conditions are met that allow for the removal of the \"I\" and assignment of a final grade), that grade will factor into the student's GPA. W\u00b1 Withdrawal - Utilized when a student leaves the course due to an approved leaveofabsence or withdraws from the school prior to the scheduled completion of a course. Any course with a \"W\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. R Repeat Some programs allow students to repeat courses. In those programs, for any course that is repeated, a Repeat will be provided as the grade for the first attempt at the course. Any course with an \"R\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, courses will be considered hours / credit hours attempted for the purpose of determining maximum time frame. Please refer to each program's student handbook for information about whether students are allowed to repeat courses in any given program. Lecture/Student Laboratory (June December): Students must attain a minimum final grade of 75% in each course. Courses with both a lecture and student laboratory will have a final grade that weights activities for both. Course syllabi will outline weights and activities/assessments for both. Patient Laboratory / Clinical Practicum (January June): The clinical practicum grade consists of three components: o Technical/Performance o Theory o Behavioral Evaluation (minimum of 10% of total grade) A minimum grade of 75% is required for both the technical and theory portions of the practicum. A minimum grade of 75% is also required for the behavioral evaluation in each rotation. Exit Exam: Students must pass a final comprehensive exam at the end of the program year.

Transcript Grades Upon completion of the program, an official transcript is sent to the State of Tennessee Medical Laboratory VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 96 Board or other state licensing board, the American Society of Clinical Pathology Board of Certification or other certification organization, and, for 3+1 students, the affiliated university or college granting the baccalaureate degree. Affiliated universities or colleges incorporate VUMC transcript grades into the transcript of the affiliated school based on that school's curriculum. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Students are required to maintain established program standards of competence and knowledge. An overall grade of 75% in each course, including the lecture/student laboratory and clinical practicum, is required for the successful completion of the course. Students who do not meet this requirement are removed from Satisfactory Academic Progress status and subject to a range of academic remedial actions, including dismissal from the program, as outlined in this catalog under the policies of the VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health. Advanced placement credits are not allowed. The program and all related courses must be completed in their entirety for a transcript to be created and given. Students must successfully complete all components of the program within the 13 months of the program and in the order presented. The Program Advisory Committee reserves the right to extend a student's training to make up for a deficit in a single course, but this remediation is not to extend training more than five (5) months from the end of the program year. As part of the Academic Probation, the student must independently review presentations and other materials from the deficient coursework for a period of no more than two (2) weeks. During this time, the student will meet with the program director, education coordinator, and the student support services manager to identify issues and discuss ways to improve their grades. The student will not be given time away from the typical program coursework or classes to complete this remedial work. The student is not allowed to be tardy or absent during this twoweek period unless an emergency justifies this tardy or absence. At the end of the two week review period, the student will take a comprehensive exam based on the material from the deficient course. The grade from this comprehensive exam will replace the previous course grade. If the grade is less than 75%, the student will be dismissed from the program. If a student does not achieve a minimum grade of 75% in a second course, a clinical rotation, or a behavioral evaluation, s/he is dismissed from the program. Graduation/Completion Requirements Students must achieve an overall minimal grade of 75% in all courses. Students must achieve a minimum of 75% on all Behavioral Evaluations.

I Incomplete May be used at the discretion of the instructor in those cases in which the student is not able to complete work in the normal time. In those instances, the student and instructor develop a written plan for an extension to provide work by a specific date that falls within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements (but in no circumstances greater than one month). An \"I\" that is not replaced by a letter grade within the period of time specified by the relevant program's requirements, due to unsatisfactory completion of the student's plan, will be changed to an F after the period specified by the program (a period not to exceed one month). Any course with an \"I\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. Once a grade is assigned to the course (when conditions are met that allow for the removal of the \"I\" and assignment of a final grade), that grade will factor into the student's GPA. W\u00b1 Withdrawal - Utilized when a student leaves the course due to an approved leaveofabsence or withdraws from the school prior to the scheduled completion of a course. Any course with a \"W\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. R Repeat Some programs allow students to repeat courses. In those programs, for any course that is repeated, a Repeat will be provided as the grade for the first attempt at the course. Any course with an \"R\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, courses will be considered hours / credit hours attempted for the purpose of determining maximum time frame. Please refer to each program's student handbook for information about whether students are allowed to repeat courses in any given program. Students who do not complete required work or hours in a course will be assigned a failing grade for the course. Clinical Rotation Evaluations Students receive a clinical evaluation from their respective preceptor at the end of each clinical rotation week. The Program Director and/or the Clinical Coordinator will review these evaluations with each student. These evaluation conversations allow for frequent and constructive feedback to students on their professional development. These evaluations are counted toward course grades in the Clinical Rotations course series as well as the review of Satisfactory Academic Progress. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) Each students' academic progress is evaluated at the end of each semester. A student is considered to be maintaining satisfactory academic progress (SAP) by maintaining a 75 percent academic average in didactic coursework and in clinical rotations. In addition, students must have satisfactory attendance in order to maintain satisfactory academic progress. Prior to the determination of SAP status, the student, the Program Director and the Clinical Coordinator meet to discuss the student's progress. These meetings include discussion of grades in didactic courses, evaluations and performance in clinical rotations, radiation dose reports, absences, contact hours, professionalism and conduct, etc. Students are given the opportunity to discuss any questions or concerns they may have related to their academic progress. Following this meeting the Program Director and the Clinical Coordinator determine whether the student is maintaining Satisfactory Academic Progress. Graduation/Complation Requirements In order to graduate, students must receive a passing grade of 75 or better in all didactic courses, including clinical rotations, and complete a list of clinical competency evaluations (\"checkoffs\"). A complete list of the Clinical Competencies is included as Appendix A.

Once a grade is assigned to the course (when conditions are met that allow for the removal of the \"I\" and assignment of a final grade), that grade will factor into the student's GPA. W\u00b1 Withdrawal - Utilized when a student leaves the course due to an approved leaveofabsence or withdraws from the school prior to the scheduled completion of a course. Any course with a \"W\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. R Repeat Some programs allow students to repeat courses. In those programs, for any course that is repeated, a Repeat will be provided as the grade for the first attempt at the course. Any course with an \"R\" grade is not calculated into the grade point average. However, courses will be considered hours / credit hours attempted for the purpose of determining maximum time frame. Please refer to each program's student handbook for information about whether students are allowed to repeat courses in any given program. Successful completion of a course requires a student to receive a 75% or greater for the final grade for the course. Scores are calculated according to the derivation chart in each syllabus. Students who do not complete required work or hours in a course will be assigned a failing grade for the course. Final grades for each course are computed on the following bases: Students must attain a final grade of 75% in each course in order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress. Nonacademic evaluations (behavior and conduct evaluations) will be completed by instructors for academic advising and/or remediation purposes. While these evaluations are calculated into the grade, behavior/professionalism concerns (e.g., missing of examinations or classes, tardiness, etc.) will have negative consequences for the student's ability to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, putting the student at risk of SAP Warning, probation and/or dismissal from the program. Clinical Evaluation Student clinical competency is measured by means of a clinical evaluation form. The clinical evaluation form has been designed to address the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor learning domains of the program as well and the interpersonal domain. The form is reviewed by the student and the instructor immediately following each case. If the evaluation consistently shows lack of competency in a particular area of a student's performance, the student will receive increased instruction and practice. Extra simulation sessions facilitated and supervised by the Program Director may be required. In addition the student will be evaluated on a midterm evaluation and/or end of rotation evaluation by clinical instructors as outlined in the syllabus of each clinical course. The clinical evaluation scale is as following: VUMC Center for Programs in Allied Health | CATALOG | Academic Year 20222023 122 1. Dependent: > 90% of the time the student almost REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and support, while < 10% of the time the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 2. Novice: 75% of the time the student REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and support, while 25% of the time the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 3. Assisted: 50% of the time the student REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and support, while 50% of the times the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 4. Supervised: 25% of the time the student REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and support, while 75% of the times the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. 5. SelfDirected: < 10% of the time the student REQUIRES direction, guidance, monitoring, and support, while >90% of the time the student EXHIBITS assertiveness, efficiency, focus, and eagerness to learn. Students are expected to make appropriate clinical progress over time, as outlined in each of the clinical courses' syllabus. Clinical Competence At the completion of the case requirements for each clinical level - or at any time by the request of the Program Director - the student's clinical performance is evaluated by the members of the Clinical Competency Committee. The student advances to the next clinical level by passing the preceding clinical course. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) In order to maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress through the curriculum plan, the student must achieve a grade of \"75%\" or better at all times in each course including simulation, research lab courses and clinical rotations. It is recommended that each student monitor his/her own progress according to the course syllabus. Students who do not meet these requirements during the semester will be placed on an academic monitoring with a remedial action plan. Progression in the Program The program and all related courses must be completed in their entirety for a transcript to be created and given. Advanced placement is not allowed. All grades of Incomplete must be replaced by a final grade before a transcript can be created. Students are required to complete all components of the program within the 22 months of program matriculation, and in the sequential order as presented in this catalog. The Program Advisory Committee reserves the right to extend a student's training to make up for a deficit in a single course, but this remediation is not to extend training more than five (5) months from the end of the program year. Code of Conduct In addition to the VUMC Code of Conduct, students in the VUMC Perfusion Program are bound by standards of conduct specific to their profession. Adherence to the VUMC Code of Conduct, the American Board of Cardiovascular Perfusion (ABCP) Code of Ethics, and the American Society of Extracorporeal Technology (AmSECT) Code of Ethics is required of students at all times.
