We do not consume enough fresh fruits and vegetables. Many of us get our whole grains from instant rice, refined wheat breads, pastas, and cereal. We eat a tremendous amount of prepackaged, pre-made meals. One-quarter of Americans eat at fast food restaurants each day. As a result of our diets, Americans are overfed and undernourished. At our office, we use [Standard Process ](http://standardprocess.com/)whole food nutritional supplements. Whole food supplements have micronutrients, both known and unknown, found only in whole foods are more essential to health than selected vitamins and minerals taken away from their complete food matrix. Standard Process product formulas contain unique combinations of whole foods (whole plants, animal tissue extracts and concentrates, and botanicals), which contain essential vitamins, phytonutrients, and minerals to provide optimal health for your patients. Ingredients are selected for their specific supportive effects in metabolism. Dr. Royal Lee, founder of Standard Process, developed whole food nutrition to support all the systems of the body. Catalyn - Introduced in 1929 Catalyn is a multiple vitamin, mineral, and trace mineral concentrate formulated by Dr. Royal Lee in 1929. Catalyn is the antithesis of the \"mega-dose\" approach to nutritional supplementation. Dr. Lee summoned the whole of his considerable nutritional experience and know-how to provide a nutritional catalyst, a supplement using whole food ingredients which he named Catalyn. Dr. Lee's goal was to provide a food-based package of nutrients in the most potent and bioavailable form-its natural state. For more information on Catalyn or other Standard Process products visit their [website](http://standardprocess.com/). At our office we believe that given proper nutrition, your body has an amazing capability of keeping itself healthy. We also believe that nutrition should be individualized to meet each patient's needs. When given the food \"Nutrient\" that your body needs, you can reach your full potential of health. Dr. Kosek uses the full line of Standard Process supplements to treat your health issues, and with CRA, he can pinpoint specific needs to help restore your health. "}
