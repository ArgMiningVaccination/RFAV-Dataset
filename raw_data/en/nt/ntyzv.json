Any financial returns generated by the Strategic Investment Fund are reinvested in our foundation's philanthropic programs. Redirected program funding Several of our foundation grantees are uniquely positioned to apply their existing work and expertise to support the COVID-19 response. We have redirected more than US$315 million from our regular program budgets to support direct COVID-19 work while continuing to support existing priorities. Although this is a significant amount, it is only a fraction of the approximately US$5 billion that we spend annually across our programs. Here are some examples of how this redirected program funding has been used: - The foundation team that focuses on scaling up innovations [helped fund an initiative](https://amsp.africa/global-partnership-to-introduce-a-connected-point-of-care-diagnostic-platform-for-covid-19-antigen-testing-in-africa/)to roll out the LumiraDx COVID-19 diagnostic platform and associated rapid antigen tests in Africa. - Several foundation teams provided supplemental funds to existing grantees to support research and development on new COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. - The foundation team that focuses on delivery of health products provided support to several existing grantees for procurement of personal protective equipment, respiratory supplies, and other COVID-19 health supplies and market coordination. - We provided [support](https://amsp.africa/press-release-covid-19-the-africa-medical-supplies-platform-africas-united-continental-supply-chain-response-to-covid-experiences-a-surge-in-demand-for-medical-supplies-from-member-stat/)to the Africa Medical Supplies Platform to help it purchase about 1 million courses of dexamethasone treatment for use in Africa. - Our Family Planning team built on existing surveys of women and young people on their contraceptive needs, adding questions about needs and behaviors during COVID-19 in order to help inform policy responses. - Our K-12 and higher education teams redirected some program funds to support emergency aid efforts in schools, helping the schools adapt to pandemic-related closures and providing support to families of low-income students that may have lost housing, food, or wages. - Foundation consultants working on polio eradication in Africa and Pakistan supported COVID-19 efforts by applying skills used in polio eradication to aid in pandemic response, including by providing training for health care workers and helping to track vaccination data. In addition to contributing program funding, teams and individuals across the foundation have provided technical assistance and expertise to organizations around the world, in areas such as vaccine manufacturing and delivery, clinical trials, supply chains, and data modeling and analytics. The foundation will continue to work with national governments, multilateral organizations, the private sector, and civil society organizations to lend our technical expertise, voice, and financial resources where they can be helpful in addressing the urgent needs expressed by our partners in low- and middle-income countries.
