You have an individual story to tell. You have a name, a history, a personality\" - Julian Seifter - Julian Seifter Naturopathic medicine is a distinct model of primary and complementary care with an emphasis in preventive medicine. Our naturopathic doctors can perform routine care, such as annual physicals, well women exams, and well child exams as well as diagnose and treat most ailments. The philosophy guiding naturopathic medicine is to improve health using the least amount of force necessary and let nature do the healing. Irrespective of one's diagnosis, no two people are identical and naturopathic medicine recognizes and respects that each patient has individual needs. Some of the treatment recommendations may include dietary and lifestyle counseling, specific nutrients and supplements, herbs, and sometimes pharmaceuticals. Treatment plans are focused on the individual and what kind of therapies resonate for that patient. While prevention is key, we all get sick sometimes. Conditions that respond well to naturopathic medicine include diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, thyroid disorders, acid reflux, auto-immune conditions, irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, depression, menopause, PMS, eczema and so much more! With the goal of patient centered care, our patients can expect a thorough and broad 75-minute initial health intake with more focused follow up visits and ample time to address their unique health goals, concerns and risk factors.
