Teo Contact Telephone 240-669-5173Contact Email teosl@niaid.nih.gov Sponsor Website Program URL Link to program URL Deadline Dates (ALL) 09-Apr-2020 The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health andHuman Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basicunderstanding of microbiology and immunology leading to thedevelopment of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics forthe prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. This Broad Agency Announcement is solicitingproposals that possess the research and development (R&D) expertisenecessary for successfully carrying out research toward meeting the program objectives of the Division of Microbiology and InfectiousDiseases (DMID), NIAID, NIH. The Research Areas included in this NIAID OMNIBUS BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT No. HHS-NIH-NIAID-BAA2020-1, as well as the projected amounts of available funding, are discussed below. Dates for receipt of proposals will be identified separately for EACH Research Area within the solicitation. Description: DIVISION OF ALLERGY, IMMUNOLOGY AND TRANSPLANTATION (DAIT), NIAID, NIH Research Area Title: Development of Radiation/Nuclear Medical Countermeasures (MCMs) The objective of this Research Area is to advance the development of candidate medical countermeasures (MCM) to reduce mortality and/or major morbidities associated with exposure to radiation from a radiological or nuclear incident. This Research Area will advance lead candidate MCMs toward eventual FDA approval or licensure to mitigate or treat radiation-induced injuries and thereby improve survival following a radiological event. It is anticipated that candidate MCMs will enter the evaluation and development pathway at various stages, from early research to post marketing (for drugs or biologics that are already licensed or approved for other indications). NIAID estimates one or two cost- reimbursement, completion type contracts may be awarded for this Research Area for an average annual total cost (direct and indirect costs combined) of up to $2 million for a non-severable base and option periods. It is anticipated that the total cost for the award(s) may vary depending upon the scope of the project and the technical objectives of the award(s). The length of time for which funding is requested should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the proposed research. In no event shall the period of performance proposed by an offeror exceed 3 years. DIVISION OF MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES (DMID), NIAID, NIH Research Area Title: Advanced Development of Vaccine Candidates for Acute Flaccid Myelitis (AFM) Associated with Enterovirus D68 The objective of this Research Area is to support the development of a candidate vaccine for EV D68 associated AFM. The primary vaccine candidate requested is an inactivated EV D68 vaccine; however, other technologies to develop a non-replicating EV D68 vaccine will be considered (e.g., VLP). Proposed inactivated EV D68 vaccines most likely will require an adjuvant using either a single vaccine vial format or a combination two vial antigen plus adjuvant format that uses bedside mixing. The preference is to use adjuvants that minimize regulatory concerns and expedite vaccine development into a Phase I clinical trial. Solicited products are anticipated to include: Development of inactivated EV D68 vaccines through a Phase I clinical trial. The Phase 1 clinical trial start date is targeted for 2021 while interim data assessment and/or completion of the clinical trial with draft data assessment is targeted prior to Aug 2022. NIAID estimates that one or more awards may be issued for this Research Area for a total cost of up to $3 million for the non-severable base work across all contracts (direct and indirect costs combined). The total duration of a proposed contract should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the offeror's proposed research. The totalSynopsisperformance period comprised of the base and any options proposed by an Offeror should not exceed five (5) years which includes stability studies. Research Area Title: Advanced Development of Vaccine Candidates for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases One objective of this Research Area is to develop vaccines to address antibiotic resistant gram-negative bacteria focusing on, but not limited to, Burkholderia spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Francisella tularensis, Yersinia pestis, and E. coli. A second objective is to support development of vaccines for emerging viruses and pandemic preparedness that includes but is not limited to alphaviruses (for example Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE)) and bunyaviruses (for example Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV)). NIAID seeks to focus this BAA on pathogens that have not recently received funding from NIAID, other agencies, or organizations. As a result, NIAID will exclude - specifically for this BAA - the following pathogens: Filoviruses, Lassa, MERS, Chikungunya, Zika and Nipah. Solicited products are anticipated to include: Lead candidate vaccines that have sufficient proof of concept data and/or clinical data to support vaccine development through manufacturing, toxicology testing, and testing in phase I/II clinical trials. NIAID estimates that three or more awards may be issued across this Research Area and the next Research Area title \"Development of Therapeutic Products for Biodefense, Anti- Microbial Resistant (AMR) Infections and Emerging Infectious Diseases\" for a total cost of up to $11.5 million for the non-severable base work across all contracts (direct and indirect costs combined). The total duration of a proposed contract should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the offeror's proposed research. The total performance period comprised of the base and any options proposed by an Offeror should not exceed five (5) years. Research Area Title: Development of Therapeutic Products for Biodefense, Anti-Microbial Resistant (AMR) Infections and Emerging Infectious Diseases The objective of this Research Area is the development of promising new therapeutics to address infections caused by NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens. For the purposes of this solicitation, therapeutic activity is defined as the cure or mitigation of disease, preferably, once signs and symptoms of infection are evident. For the purposes of this solicitation, a therapeutic candidate is either a lead series, lead, or product candidate, and is either a drug (synthetic or natural product) or a biological product (e.g. monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins). This Research Area support lead optimization, pre-clinical (IND enabling) and clinical trials that include Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. Solicited products are anticipated to include: Therapeutic lead series/lead/product candidate must address infections caused by one or more pathogens listed among NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens, NIAID estimates that three or more awards may be issued across this Research Area and the preceding Research Area title \"Advanced Development of Vaccine Candidates for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases\" for a total cost of up to $11.5 million for the non-severable base work across all contracts (direct and indirect costs combined). The total duration of a proposedcontract should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the offeror's proposed research. The total performance period comprised of the base and any options proposed by an Offeror should not exceed five (5) years. Research Area Title: Advanced Development of Diagnostics for Biothreats and Emerging Infectious Diseases The objective of this Research Area is to advance the development of novel, rapid sample-to-answer candidate diagnostic products that will address biodefense and pandemic preparedness. Initial proof-of- concept demonstration that diagnostic method can detect a biological component (eg., pathogen, protein, nucleic acid, etc), preferable in a relevant clinical matrix (e.g., blood, urine, swab, etc) is required for preliminary data. Solicited products are anticipated to include: Early through late-stage diagnostics to address biodefense and pandemic preparedness. Diagnostic must detect one of the following agents: Bacillus anthracis and must phenotypically determine its antibiotic susceptibility Yersinia pestis and must phenotypically determine its antibiotic susceptibility Francisella tularemia and must phenotypically determine its antibiotic susceptibility Burkholderia sp. and must phenotypically determine its antibiotic susceptibility Botulinum toxin and must identify and distinguish relevant serotypes Lassa virus Nipah virus Rift Valley Zika virus Candida auris Coccidioides sp. NIAID estimates that one or more awards may be issued for this Research Area for a total cost of up to $2 million for the non-severable base work across all contracts (direct and indirect costs combined). The total duration of a proposed contract should be consistent with the nature and complexity of the offeror's proposed research.

Archive Date 2/18/2023 090432 RFP --Prototype Development to Combat Novel Coronavirus Disease COVID -19 Department of the Army MTEC - Presolicitation - COVID -19 15-Apr-2020 Not Specified Contact Name Randall Fernanders Contact Telephone 843-760-3378 Contact Email randall.fernanders@ati.org Sponsor Website Link to sponsor website Program URL Deadline Dates (ALL) 15-Apr-2020 Synopsis The Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC) is excited to post this pre - announcement for a potential Request for Project Proposals (RPP) focused on the development of prototypes aimed to combat the coronavirus (COVID -19). *CAUTION: All information contained in this pre -announcement has not been formally approved by the Government, and represents MTEC's interpretation of the situation at this time. All information is subject to change. PROGRAM BACKGROUND: In light of the magnitude and potential threa t that the coronavirus (COVID -19) poses to our military's health and readiness, the Government seeks to rapidly accelerate the inquiry, testing, and fielding of new 21st century capabilities, employing novel technologies and approaches to the detection of exposure, prevention, containment and treatment of COVID -19 and future emerging threats. SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS: This pre -announcement has been developed by MTEC to provide notice for the possibility of one or more upcoming RPPs focused on combating COVID -19. This notice may also help the membership form appropriate partnerships/teaming relationships so that they are poised to respond to the full requirements described in potential upcoming RPPs. CAUTION: These solution requirements have not been formally es tablished by the Government, and are solely MTEC's interpretation of the critical needs of the U.S. military. MTEC believes that an emphasis will be placed on technologies that can be deployed as soon as possible but no later than 31 December 2020. In supp ort of this, MTEC has identified the following potential areas of interest: Point -of-care diagnostic that provides rapid and accurate determination on exposure to COVID -19. Prophylactic(s)/Therapeutic(s) that can prevent and/or treat in a rapid manner (few hours to 2 days) potentially in a non -hospital environment. Repurposing FDA -approved drugs/biologics for prevention/treatment of COVID -19 or testing of drugs/biologics that have already demonstrated safety in humans for the prevention/treatment of COVID -19 are preferred. Disease predictive modeling that provides early warning through data capture from several different streams of data to include social media and artificial intelligence (AI) parameter decision tools that would provide actionable information to medical service providers and command structures. Patient monitoring, tracking, and management system for in -home or non -hospital environment patient tele- health services to include interface into the Cerner electronic health record. POTENTIAL FUNDING: Although there is no specific funding commitment by the U.S. Government at this time, MTEC believes that there may be tens of millions of dollars available for combating COVID -19 programs with a likelihood of follow -on funding. ACQUISITION APPROACH: The M TEC will implement the \"Enhanced White Paper\" contracting methodology for this potential upcoming RPP(s), which will be an accelerated approach to award. Because of the nature and urgency of the program's requirements, this streamlined approach is anticipated to be a better means to highlight company methodologies and skills required to address the technical and transition requirements. The Enhanced White Paper process requires extremely quick turnaround times by Offerors. Once the RPP is released, Offerors will be required to submit their Enhanced White Papers within two weeks. Enhanced White Papers will include an abbreviated technical approach, detailed statement of work, and an estimate of cost. All Enhanced White Papers will be provided to the Governmen t for scientific and programmatic relevance evaluation. Upon review of the Enhanced White Papers, several Offerors may be invited for informal discussions with the Government. Offerors who are recommended for award will be required to submit a full cost pr oposal. MTEC anticipates that awards will be issued within 4-6 weeks of the RPP release date. Please pay special attention to the upcoming RPP instructions because of the changes that will be made to accommodate the expedited solicitation to award timefram es. The upcoming RPP(s) will be posted to the MTEC website (mtec -sc.org) and a notice will be posted on www.beta.SAM.gov to notify interested parties. Contingent upon approval from the Government, the upcoming RPP(s) is expected to be released within the n ext few weeks and will have an extremely short preparation period (approximately 14 days). Due to the critical and urgent nature of the technical topic area, MTEC membership is NOT required for the submission of an enhanced white paper in response to this upcoming MTEC RPP. However, membership will be required for Offerors recommended for award. To join MTEC, please visit http://mtec -sc.org/how -to-join/. MTEC MEMBER TEAMING: While teaming is not required for this effort, Offerors are encouraged to consider teaming during the proposal preparation period (prior to proposal submission) if they cannot address the full scope of technical requirements of the RPP or otherwise believe a team may be beneficial to the Government. MTEC members are encouraged to use the MTEC Database Collaboration Tool to help identify potential teaming partners among other MTEC members. The Database Collaboration Tool provides a quick and easy way to search the membership for specific technology capabilities, collaboration interest, core business areas/focus, R&D highlights/projects, and technical expertise. Contact information for each organization is provided as part of the member profile in the collaboration database tool to foster follow -up conversations between members as needed. Th e Collaboration Database Tool can be accessed via the \"MTEC Profiles Site\" tab on the MTEC members -only website. MTEC: The MTEC mission is to assist the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) by providing cutting -edge technologies and supporting life cycle management to transition medical solutions to industry that protect, treat, and optimize Warfighters' health and performance across the full spectrum of military operations. MTEC is a biomedical technology consortium collaborating with multiple government agencies under a 10 -year renewable Other Transaction Agreement (OTA), Agreement No. W81XWH -15-9-0001, with the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA). MTEC is currently recruiting a broad and diverse membership tha t includes representatives from large businesses, small businesses, \"nontraditional\" defense contractors, academic research institutions and not -for-profit organizations.
