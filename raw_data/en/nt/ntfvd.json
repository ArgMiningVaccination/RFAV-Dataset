A lot of my clients ask me if they should get the flu shot and I thought it would be a good idea to have a medical doctor answer that question. Here is a blog by my doctor Yoshi Rahm, D.O. Dr. Yoshi Rahm is a Board Certified Osteopathic Family Physician with a separate board certification in Integrative and Holistic Medicine. He's the proud father of baby Kalaya. About a year ago, I wrote a blog about the flu. I wondered aloud if the flu shot is the best option to prevent the flu. Needless to say, I have not been impressed by the flu shot in the past. Long have I wondered why they don't make vaccines without all the crappy toxins in them. Social media outlets are frenzied over the flu shot debate (not to mention the vaccine debate in general). \"To get or not to get the flu shot\". As a physician, I am often asked this exact question. My answer is that it is a complicated decision and depends on your beliefs, your genetics, and your current health. As an integrative physician, my goal is both to [inform you](http://wholisticbeginnings.com/blog/2013/7/2/be-informed-ask-your-healthcare-provider-questions?rq=informed%20) and to get at the root cause of a condition and build your health from the ground up. Like antibiotics, vaccines have been touted as a medical breakthrough that has saved many lives. And they undoubtedly have! However, the country's one-size-fits-all, and sometimes extremely high number of mandatory, vaccination policies are not necessarily in the best interest of your individual health. Let's talk about the crappy toxins in the ingredients Many of the ingredients added into vaccines are known carcinogens and detergents that have harmful or unknown effects on the human body. [Package inserts](http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM220624.pdf) for Fluarix and Fluvirin even state that they are uncertain as to whether or not your fertility will be affected by the vaccine (fertility has been steadily declining over the past several decades). Also there is the warning that \"safety and effectiveness have not been established in pregnant women or nursing mothers\" for these flu vaccines. The surprising news is that vaccines, have never been studied in a truly placebo controlled manner, in single, or multiple deliveries, and not for long-term outcomes, even in a general population. Let's learn more about what ingredients are in these vaccines and specifically, what is in the flu vaccine? Aluminum gels or salts of aluminum, which are added as adjuvants to help the vaccine stimulate a better response to the vaccine. Aluminum is a recognized neurotoxin that can adversely affect the central nervous system and cause cognitive deficiency and dementia if it enters the brain. Numerous [studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3056430/)have linked aluminum to Alzheimer's disease. Antibiotics, which are added to some vaccines to prevent the growth of germs (bacterial) during production and storage of the vaccine. The antibiotics hidden in the flu vaccine include neomycin, streptomycin, or penicillin, which can cause severe allergic reactions in many people. Egg protein is found in influenza vaccines, which are prepared using chicken eggs. Beware if you can't eat egg products without poor reactions. Formaldehyde is used to inactivate bacterial products for toxoid vaccines. Formaldehyde is used in \"inactivated\" vaccines which are almost all of the flu vaccines available on the market. It is also used to kill unwanted viruses and bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production. Formaldehyde is a powerful chemical used as a disinfectant and preservative in mortuaries and medical labs. It is listed as a human carcinogen in the [13th Report on Carcinogens](http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/?objectid=03C9AF75-E1BF-FF40-DBA9EC0928DF8B15)published by the National Toxicology Program. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) and 2-phenoxy-ethanol, which are used as a stabilizer in a few vaccines to help the vaccine remain unchanged when the vaccine is exposed to heat, light, acidity, or humidity. Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative that is added to vials of vaccine that contain more than one dose to prevent contamination and growth of potentially harmful bacteria. Studies have demonstrated that thimerosal can contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases by suppressing the overall immune system and causing systemic inflammation. Due to the controversy concerning this additive, some companies have started producing thimerosal-free vaccines, which are available in a limited supply at certain pharmacies. However, most of these \"thimerosal-free\" vaccines have less mercury in them, they actually still have some mercury in them that are technically still at toxic levels. Polysorbate 80 is a detergent used to help drugs and chemicals cross the blood-brain barrier. Unfortunately, this stabilizer is also used to treat chronic kidney failure and can contribute to [liver toxicity](http://www.drugs.com/inactive/polysorbate-80-372.html). Polysorbate 80 was also shown to cause \"severe non-immunologic anaphylactoid reactions\" in this studyfrom 2005. Do you really want these potentially toxic substances injected into your body, or worse, your child's body? Now, let's look at the flu vaccine's effectiveness in preventing illness. According to the CDC, the 2014-2015 flu vaccine had reduced an individuals risk of visiting a doctor due to the flu by 23%. That does not mean that it was 23% effective. It just means that it reduced flu symptoms enough to avoid wanting to go to the doctor by 23% (BTW that is about the rate of placebo). Going back in time a little more, according to a [study ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16437500) in 2008, the influenza vaccine was only 59% successful and benefited only 36% of the healthy children over the age of 2 who received it. Another [study ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18838647) from 2008 indicated that the number of children's doctor visits or hospitalizations did not differ between vaccinated and non-vaccinated children measured over two consecutive flu seasons, suggesting that the influenza vaccine had very little effect on children's overall health status. Additional [studies](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23881655) show that flu vaccines do not prevent influenza transmission to the patients of healthcare workers. To be fair, the rate is reportedly higher in other years. The bottom line is that vaccination is not a foolproof way to avoid disease. The shots do cause side effects, and sometimes those side effects are serious. The NVIC (National Vaccine Information Center) continues to ask \"is the atypical manipulation of the immune system with more and more vaccines in early life setting some children up for chronic disease and disability? Is less better?\" They point out that American children are the most highly vaccinated children in the world (receiving 49 doses of 14 vaccines before the age of 6), and are also among the most chronically ill and disabled. The CDC admits that one in six U.S. children is now developmentally delayed. During the past quarter century, the number of children with learning disabilities, ADHD, asthma, and diabetes has more than tripled. More than twice as many children have chronic brain and immune system dysfunction today than did in the 1970s when half as many vaccines were given to children. According to Dr. Gary Goldman's [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23023030)there was a 4,250% increase in fetal deaths associated with mercury in the swine flu vaccine shot given to pregnant women. Number of reactions from flu shots, reported to [VAERS:](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/index)93,000 Number of deaths following a flu shot according to [VAERS](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/index): 1,080 Number of days of missed work saved by getting the flu shot: 0.13 days according to ( [Cochrane](http://www.cochrane.org/CD001269/ARI_vaccines-to-prevent-influenza-in-healthy-adults)). According to the CDC, [this study](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X15002315), suggests that 40,125 lives were saved by the flu vaccine over a 9 year period and that about 88% of those were in people older than 65 years of age. You be your own judge. Everything in medicine is risks versus benefits. So, Who Should Get a Flu Shot? There is quite a quandary surrounding recommendations for immunocompromised individuals such as those with autoimmune diseases who are on immune-suppressing medications. The original thought was that they would be at higher risk of getting the flu and would benefit from getting vaccinated. However, recent studies have shown that the flu vaccine is less effective in these immunocompromised individuals. Given that thimerosal has been implicated in [triggering autoimmune disease ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19857314)and that those with autoimmune diseases are three times more likely to develop another autoimmune disease, it would seem that the risk of getting a flu vaccine far outweighs any potential benefits. Certainly those with chronic lung diseases like cystic fibrosis, asthma, or COPD may want to weigh the risk with the benefits, as it might be potentially life-saving in those individuals. If you do elect to receive a flu shot, I would highly recommend a thimerosal-free vaccine (still has some thimerosal in it though), which are available in a limited supply. If you don't already know your MTHFR gene mutations, I would definitely get them checked. If you have any mutations at this gene, it is difficult for your body to eliminate mercury from your system, even in trace amounts. I would also caution you against taking any over-the-counter pain medications, such as tylenol, advil, or aspirin, in conjunction with your vaccine. These have been [shown ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2693360/) to reduce the effectiveness of vaccines by limiting your body's proper immune response. If you do decide to get the flu vaccine, then most CVS or Walgreens type of minute-clinics or urgent care facilities are happy to do it. Is there a \"cleaner greener\" Flu shot option? Yes!!! Introducing [Flublok](http://www.flublok.com/). While conventional flu shots have many toxins (mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, antibiotics, Polysorbate 80, MSG, egg protein). Flublok has none of these additives and is made using 3 times the amount of actual antigen (flu DNA that makes you immune to the flu). Flublok also does not require incubation in chicken eggs which greatly reduces the eco-footprint of the manufacturing process and eliminates the risk of bacterial contamination or egg allergen exposure. The makers of Flublok state that it is completely free of heavy metals, formaldehyde, latex, antibiotics, gluten and egg residues. And since it does not require use of actual live flu viruses, it is free of attenuated viral particles, unlike other flu shots. This is as clean and green as a flu shot can get and is the way that I'd love to see all vaccines be made. Manon Cox, PhD, CEO of Protein Sciences who makes Flublok, believes her company has obviated most if not all concerns people have about vaccines - concerns that have been loudly emphasized by vaccine critics and unduly dismissed by equally vociferous vaccine advocates. Watch a short simple 1 minute Flublok video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGnUmYEmNtA). Or learn more about Flublok from their website [here.](http://www.flublok.com/) Flublok first became available late in 2014 and is approved for people aged 18 and older. I am excited! This kind of vaccine should have been made available to the public in the 1990's or even 1980's. The technology was there, but the economic incentives were not made available by those that control such things. Oh well. At least it's now finally available in the annual flu shot. As of December 2015, Target Pharmacy is the only place you can get Flublok in the Los Angeles area. Now, does all this mean Flublok is actually totally safe? Frankly, it hasn't been around long enough to know. I wish I knew. But, what I can say is that it certainly cleaner and greener and it seems like a much better option than all the other conventional flu shots. What are some natural alternatives for preventing and treating the flu or a simple cold? YES!!!! Click on [Best Prevention For Cold and Flu Season.](http://wholisticbeginnings.com/blog//best-prevention-for-cold-and-flu-season) If you do decide to get the flu vaccine... Then there are some homeopathic remedies that one can take to mitigate potential side effects (these are available in the office if you can't find them at your local health food store.) Thuja 5 pellets under tongue twice daily x 7 days after EVERY vaccination. Alumina 5 pellets under tongue three times daily x 7 days after EVERY vaccination with aluminum in them (if not sure then take as precaution). Influenzinum 5 pellets under tongue twice daily x 3 days for after flu vaccination. Gelsemium 5 pellets under tongue twice daily x 3 days for after flu vaccination. What if your pregnant? According to Aviva Rohm, M.D. and her blog post [What's a Pregnant Mom to Do? Flu Vaccine in Pregnancy](https://avivaromm.com/flu-vaccine-in-pregnancy-whats-a-girl-to-do/), if you do decide to get the Flu shot don't beat your self up about it. There area few things you can do to optimize safety: Do NOT get the nasal spray vaccine during pregnancy. It is made with live virus and is not considered safe in pregnancy. The flu shot is made from an inactivated virus, and is the only recommended vaccination for use in pregnancy. Don't get vaccinated if you have a fever or otherwise feel unwell. Don't get the flu vaccine if you have a moderate to severe egg allergy. ASK YOUR DOCTOR FOR A THIMEROSAL FREE flu vaccine. They are available and it may need to be special ordered for you. The thimerosal-free versions usually come as a single dose injection; the multi-vial preparations are much more likely to contain the preservative. What's THREE Times More Effective Than Flu Shot? Colostrum. Colostrum is the first substance to come out of the nipple after a baby is born. It comes out in very small volumes but is packed with all the right nutrients to protect the brand new baby from potentially harmful germs. Over the first few days, the colostrum turns to milk but the newest colostrum doesn't actually contain milk. [Colostrum](http://wholisticbeginnings.com/blog/2014/7/2/colostrum?rq=colostrum) supercharges the baby's immune system and is much much better than the flu shot at protecting against the flu. [This was demonstrated in a recent study.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17456621) To read more click [here](http://dryoshirahm.blogspot.com/2015/03/three-times-more-effective-than-flu-shot.html). The researchers concluded that \"Colostrum, both in healthy subjects and high-risk cardiovascular patients, is at least three times more effective than vaccination to prevent flu and is very cost-effective.\" That's powerful stuff! Good news, you can actually buy colostrum as a supplement! Guess what my new kid is gonna get this March... COLOSTRUM. And guess what I'll probably give my kid next flu season too?! Once again, the decision to receive vaccinations of any kind is highly individualized. My goal, as always, is to empower you with the knowledge to make the best and most informed decision you can for yourself and your health.
