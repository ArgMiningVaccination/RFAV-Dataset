Sadly, our mainstream American dietary habits don't provide an adequately balanced infusion of the healthy nutrients required by our physical bodies to properly function. For those of us, age 50 and older, Centrum Silver is our faithful friend and Vitamin D our close companion. What about when it comes to our faith? Our spiritual lives need regular attention, too. Someone has said, \"Seven days without prayer makes one weak!\" To maintain a strong and healthy faith we need a daily dosage of certain supplements. The apostle Peter gives some sage instruction in 2 Peter 1:3-11 concerning this topic. God's divine power has given us everything that pertains to life and godliness through Christ (v. 3). It is by Jesus alone that we are beneficiaries of God's \"precious and very great promises\" in order that we may become \"partakers of the divine nature\" by escaping the sinful corruption of the world (v. 4). In verses 5-11 (ESV), Peter continues as follows: For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge, and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness, and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love. For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins. Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall. For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. In these verses, the wise apostle mentions no less than seven qualities (italicized above), which are essential to satisfactory spiritual health and faith development. These critically important things include virtue, knowledge, self-control, steadfastness, godliness, brotherly affection, and love. Virtue has to do with moral goodness, integrity and character. Knowledge relates to biblical literacy, spiritual insight and theological understanding. Self-control pertains to sobriety, willpower, personal restraint and self-discipline. Steadfastness points to perseverance and stick-to-it-iveness in our Christian walk \u2014 an \"I'll never give up hope and won't ever quit serving Christ\" sort of attitude. Godliness speaks to righteousness, reverence, and holiness in our thoughts, words and deeds. Brotherly affection has to do with kindness, genuine care, and warm regard for our Christian family members. Love implies selfless sacrifice, service of God, and putting the well-being of others ahead of our own selfish interests. The above qualities, in growing measure, are essential elements needed in order to confirm our spiritual calling and election by Christ (vs. 10-11). It is a demonstration of the reality that we belong to him and have made him the first priority in our lives. Merely believing in God and/or Christ simply doesn't suffice, according to James, the half-brother of our Lord, who tells us that, \"Faith without works is dead\" and thus absolutely useless (Jas. 2:17, 26). A real, saving faith in Jesus Christ is made manifest through a faithful and obedient response to the message of the Gospel. So, are you taking your daily supplements, as Peter has prescribed? Your spiritual health depends on it. They are a clear and vivid demonstration of our faith for the world to see!
