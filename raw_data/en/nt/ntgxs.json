Prophylactic vaccination is arguably the most effective medical preventative method. After local inoculation,vaccines induce antigen-specific systemic immunity, protectingthe whole body. Systemic antitumour immunity can cureadvanced cancer, but will therapeutic vaccination suffice? Avaccine for castration-refractory prostate cancer (CRPC) wasapproved by regulatory authority, but its evidence is disputed.We critically reviewed the clinical efficacy of therapeuticcancer vaccines for prostate cancer, including the results of 31clinical studies employing vaccines-only, and another 10studies combining vaccines with immune co-stimulation.Vaccinations yielded immunological responses, but no studyshowed evidence for clinically relevant therapeuticimprovement. Clinical failure of therapeutic vaccination isdiscussed in the light of immunological dogmas andmechanisms of antitumour therapies. We propose that be improved by immunological danger,i.e. disturbing tumour homeostasis by destroying the tumourtissue or inducing local inflammation. Such danger mightoverride immunological tolerance, and thereby allow clinicallyrelevant anticancer results. Curative treatment options for advanced cancer, e.g. disseminated disease, are very limited. Chemotherapy mayprevent and reduce formation of metastases, but it rarely cures patients from advanced metastasized disease. Incontrast, the immune system could mount antigen-specificresponses against such cancerous lesions. Spontaneoustumour regression in patients with heavy infections has beendocumented for about a century (1). In the 1950s, thevalidity of the antitumour immunity concept was shown inanimal experiments (2). In the 18th century, vaccines ( i.e. weakened antigens) were already being used for efficientclinical protection. Therefore, it seemed logical to search fora vaccine against cancer. A decade ago, experts in the fieldconcluded that half a century of antitumour vaccine researchhad not yielded any major clinical breakthroughs (3). Classical vaccine technology holds the golden rule that vaccines should be applied in the prophylactic setting, i.e.prior inoculation with the pathogen. This is why children, but notdiseased people, are vaccinated against bacterial and viralpathogens to prevent the development of disease. Prophylacticvaccination also yields good protection against infection withtumourigenic viruses (4-6). Therapeutic vaccination is a differentchapter in immunology from prophylactic vaccination. Indeed,microbiologists have often tried therapeutic vaccination, butgenerally with little if any clinical efficacy. This is in sharpcontrast to prophylactic vaccination which has been shown tohave invaluable clinical efficacy. In therapeutic settings, the battleagainst micro-organisms does not include vaccination. Clinicianschose interference with pathogen reproduction by treatment withantibiotics. Such a dual strategy resembles prophylacticvaccination against tumourigenic viruses on the one hand, andapplying chemotherapy in tumour-bearing patients. In light ofthe described efficacy of immunotherapy and the limited efficacyof chemotherapy in advanced disease, therapeutic vaccination fortreatment of cancer might be evaluated on its clinical efficacy,despite the apparent lack of efficacy against microbes. 2689This article is freely accessible online.

They have hailed thisapproval stating that immunotherapy has earned its spot in theranks of cancer therapy (7). The studies with therapeuticvaccination using Sipuleucel-T in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) showed statisticallysignificant results (8, 9). However, the results did not matchthe criteria for clinically relevant improvement of anticancertherapy, e.g. at least six months prolonged survival compared to standard therapy (10, 11). Moreover, some serious concernshave been raised about the experimental design of theseclinical studies. Patients in the control group were notsubjected to standard treatment, but also receivedleukapheresis processing with 1.5-2 times the patient's bloodvolume. While patients in the Sipuleucel-T treatment groupwere reinfused with all their mononuclear cells, those in the'control' group actually had a net removal of about 60% oftheir circulating mononuclear cells. Patients in the 'control'group had a decreased survival compared to literature, whereasthe treatment group had 'normal' survival. Another unexpectedfinding was that elderly patients had an adverse prognosis inthis study, in contrast to general expectations (12). In short,both the controversial study design and lack of clinicallyrelevant results are a serious bloodletting to the evidence forclinical efficacy of therapeutic cancer vaccination. The concept of therapeutic vaccination is not invalidated, however, by lack of evidence in a single study. Therapeuticvaccines have been extensively tested for CRPC using a dozendifferent approaches. From a tumour immunological viewpoint,CRPC is an ideal target since (i) prostate cancer is the mostcommon cancer in men and the second most common cause ofcancer-related death among men in Europe and North America(13, 14), (ii) no curative options exist for patients with advanceddisease, i.e.disseminated CRPC (15-17), (iii) the overall survival is 28 to 36 months (18), implying sufficient time foreffective immunological reactions to develop (iv) variousprostate-specific antigens exist (19-22); and (v) the prostate itis not a vital organ, thus limiting the risk of life-threateningautoimmune complications. Keeping in mind, the massiveclinical evidence of the efficacy of prophylactic vaccination, andthe promises of cancer immunotherapy in general (23),therapeutic vaccination seems a reasonable approach for CRPC. Forty-one clinical studies were performed that could have rejected the null hypothesis that there is no clinical-relevanteffect of therapeutic vaccines. Most of these, 31/41, usedtherapeutic vaccines only, and 10 studies also used systemicinjection (antibodies against) co-stimulatory molecules(e.g. Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4; CTLA4). We discuss these therapeutic results in light of cancerimmunology, and anticancer therapies, including otherimmunotherapeutic approaches.Therapeutic Vaccines Trigger Anticancer Immune Responses The efficacy of prophylactic vaccination is often determined by measuring the increase in antigen-specific antibody or T-lymphocyte responses as a surrogate for immunologicalprotection. Five studies measured antigen-specific immuneresponses by increasing levels of antibodies. The vastmajority of treated patients, 85% (96 out of 113) hadincreased levels of tumour-associated antibodies (24-28). Inthree studies, cytotoxic helper T-cellswere counted, and vaccines stimulated antigen-specific T-cellproliferation in all 61 patients (24, 25, 27). This shows thatthese vaccines were technically effective in that they inducedhumoral and cellular immune responses in treated patients.No hard rules exist on immunological responses and clinicalprotection, but the immune responses are generally calibratedto their clinical efficacy. In prophylactic studies, immuneprotection is measured by pathogen challenge ( i.e.in animal experiments) or the odds of developing disease afterexposure to the pathogen. A major difference betweenprophylactic and therapeutic vaccination is that in thetherapeutic setting no calibration of immune protection withsurrogate immune parameters can be made. Thus the clinicalefficacy must be measured directly, by monitoring diseaseregression and progression after vaccination. Therapeutic Vaccination Yields No Clinically Relevant Anticancer Effects Since patients with immunological response had a technically successful intervention, we focused on clinicalresponses in these patients. Only two out of 96 patients withantibody responses had a complete (CR) or a partial (PR)regression (Table I) (24-28). In addition, only one patient hada CR, and there were no PRs out of 61 patients with vaccine-stimulated antigen-specific T-cell proliferation (24, 25, 27).Although the vaccines were effective in inducing immuneresponses, they did not induce clinical responses. Thistherefore confirms earlier conclusions that antibody responseand specific T-cell proliferation are not adequate predictorsof clinical response to therapeutic vaccines (28, 29). Clinically relevant parameters are the various measures of survival, i.e. disease-free, overall, and progression-free survival. Many studies also measure immune or biochemicalparameters, but these are only important if they can be linkeddirectly to survival of patients. The Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) parameters also allow for measurement of tumoursize (30). A surrogate parameter for the size of prostatecarcinoma can be monitored by measuring Prostate-SpecificAntigen (PSA) in serum. Prostate carcinomas shed PSA intothe circulation, and a smaller tumour would shed less PSAANTICANCER RESEARCH 34: 2689-2700 (2014) 2690than a larger one. Changes in PSA are interpreted in two ways, as PSA response and changes in doubling time (DT).Changes in PSA DT are not considered to be a measure oftherapeutic efficacy, since the DT implies that PSA is stillhigh and rising (31). It is important to stress that from aclinical point of view, patients with a decrease in PSA DTstill have progressive disease (PD). A PSA response, i.e.a significant reduction of PSA value, could be indicative of a clinical response. The drawback isthat measuring serum PSA is an indirect measure of thetherapeutic effect. PSA levels can rise due to prostatitis andother diseases (32-34). Most relevantly successfulimmunotherapy of regional cancer, e.g. bladder carcinoma, can significantly increase the PSA levels (35), possibly as abystander effect of local inflammation. In line with this,current criteria of the Prostate Cancer Working Group(PCWG2) strongly diminish the importance of PSA levels,in favour of measurement of the primary tumour andmetastases (36). Considering the effect of tumour load andinflammation, the intended immunological rejection ofprostate cancer could cause an increase or a decrease in PSA.The surrogacy of PSA end-points makes it unsuitable as theprimary end-point in clinical trials in prostate cancer,especially in testing non-cytotoxic agents such asimmunotherapy (37-39). Clinical relevance of a therapeutic intervention should be evaluated in terms of a clear therapeutic benefit for thepatients, and not as a change of a surrogate marker (10, 11).Ideally the benefit should be clinically prolonged survival,however this is not measured in most studies. Therefore, wefocused on direct measurement of the therapeutic efficacy,e.g. in terms of CR, PR, stable disease (SD), and PD.Depending on the stage of CRPC, overall or disease-free survival could be monitored. A PSA test is a highly sensitivebiochemical measurement for the presence of prostate cellsin the body. In this light, progression-free survival might beconsidered if the included patients only had non-clinicallymanifest, biochemical disease ( i.e.'PSA recurrence') and progression was defined as the first detected metastasis;technically this would be referred to as clinical progression. Table II summarizes data of 41 clinical studies employing therapeutic vaccination against prostate cancer performed in2000-2012. These vaccination approaches have used theentire spectrum of modern vaccine technology, includingdifferent types of antigen (prostate cancer cells, protein,peptides, DNA, and carbohydrates), different modes ofdelivery Interleukin 2(IL2); co-stimulatory molecules or inhibition of CTLA4).Considering the importance of responses in clinical phase I,II and III studies, it may be assumed that any response,whether complete or partial would be reported. However thestate-of-the art vaccination technologies led to only one CRand three PRs out of 1,100 treated patients. Traditionally, clinical effects against CRPC are not measured by remissions (CRs and PRs), but by determiningPSA level. As stated before, this may not be the optimalmethod since effective immune responses might also inducea rise in PSA. Table III shows the PSA responses for allvaccines together, vaccines-plus-docetaxel, docetaxel-aloneand mitoxantrone. The PSA responses for all vaccines werelow, with an average of about 2%. Even the best result in asingle study yielded less than 13%. This is much lower thanstudies employing chemotherapy. A small study of thecombination of vaccine with docetaxel yielded 21%, anddocetaxel alone 48%. Another chemotherapy intervention,mitoxantrone yielded 30% PSA responses. Taken together both the remissions and the PSA responses do not indicate clinical efficacy of the therapeutic vaccines. Evaluation of the Lack of Clinical Efficacy As stated before, prophylactic vaccination against pathogenseffectively prevents disease by inducing immunity. Otherimmunotherapeutic approaches have produced results thatsuggest that the immune system can also cure cancer andprotect from recurrent disease. Why are these results notreflected in the outcomes of 1,100 patients with prostatecancer treated with therapeutic vaccination? Manydifferences existed within vaccination philosophies andprotocols used, and it could be argued that only a fewvaccination studies used an effective protocol, blurring thedata in the aggregate of 41 studies. One could further reasonJacobs et al: Therapeutic Vaccines and Prostate Cancer (Review) 2691Table I. Immunological responses compared to clinical responses in studies using therapeutic vaccination.

But dothese arguments suffice for the lack of clinical efficacy thatis found after vaccination? First of all, the PSA responses were much lower, even in the vaccine study most responsive effects compared to docetaxeltreatment, e.g. 13% versus 48%, respectively. Thus vaccines seem to be ineffective in inducing PSA response. Alternatively,a single study might induce CR or PR in a substantial group ofpatients. Various other cancer immunotherapies have yieldedsuch results that are statistically significant and clinicallyrelevant in groups of 10 to 50 patients (40). In order to obtaina p-value <0.05, at least three patients in a study should have a CR or PR. Besides the possibility of being statisticallysignificant, this would also be considered as clinically relevant.We previously discussed the induction of immune responses in85% to 100% of the patients treated, which correlates nicelywith data from prophylactic studies showing that 90 to 100% ofthe vaccinated people were protected. If three CR or PRresponses were obtained in a study with ten to fifty patients, itwould be a clinical response of 6 to 30%. Thus, if therapeuticvaccination were clinically effective, such a response should bemore than feasible. Reviews of clinical immunotherapeuticstudies for eight different forms of both locally advanced andmetastasized cancer showed that these yielded on average 50%CRs and PRs. All 15 studies with six to 35 patients had at leastthree clinical responses in patients with immunotherapy (41).From all these data it is more than reasonable to assume that ifsimilar results had been obtained in any of these 41 studies,these would have arisen at the analysis of PSA responses, orCRs and PRs. Nevertheless, such a result was not found in any of the vaccination studies. It is hard to solely attribute thefailure of success to a sub-optimal vaccination strategy, sincethese studies employed many different vaccination strategies,all being the state-of-the art vaccine technology. Cancer immunotherapy is not a strategy without clinical results. Although therapeutic vaccination has failed to showclinical efficacy, other forms of cancer immunotherapy didshow clinically relevant results (40, 41). Thus the questionmight be asked is therapeutic vaccination a putative curativetherapy of cancer? And if not, how could cancerimmunotherapy be improved? Cutting a long story short, vaccines are most effective in preventing, but not curing, disease. The next question is, canwe explain the inefficacy of therapeutic vaccines usingimmunological dogmas?

Helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes can differentiate into a variety of effector andtolerogenic functions. Immunologists differentiate betweentype 1, type 2, type 17 (T H17), and a whole range of suppressor and regulatory T-lymphocytes. Tumour-infiltrating T-cells can become immune suppressive ortolerogenic (42). Regulatory T-lymphocytes were shown tobe involved in immune tolerance to murine tumours, andwere also demonstrated in various human tumours (43).Tumours induce various kinds of regulatory T-lymphocytes(44). In the blood of patients with prostate cancer, cluster ofdifferentiation 4 (CD4 +) in number and function (45-47). Locally in thetumour, different types of tolerogenic T-lymphocytes areinvolved, e.g. T H17and classical TReg(47, 48). Other studies have pinpointed the involvement of CD8+ regulatory cells in prostate cancer by the markers Foxp3+or programmed death 1 (PD-1+) (49, 50). The complex roles of different CD4+and CD8+T-lymphocytes were further confirmed (51, 52). In the most simplified model from a clinical perspective, two typesof T-cells exist: immunogenic and tolerogenic lymphocytes.How does immunological tolerance affect theefficacy of therapeutic vaccination? Therapeutic vaccination increases both effector T- lymphocytes and regulatory T-lymphocytes (53). Both types ofantigen-specific T-lymphocytes respond to the tumour antigenthey recognize and T-cell factors ( e.g. cytokines such as IL2, and IL15). In the prophylactic setting, the immunesystem is na\u00efve and has the plasticity be Any the thepresence of antigen and cytokines. However, in diseasedindividuals the immune system is not na\u00efve, but tolerant, i.e. 'instructed' for tumour tissue protecting responses. Thesememory T-lymphocytes have transcription factors that enablethem to respond similarly to recall antigens as they did before(54-56). Thus once established, immune responses are ratherrigid, and do not easily change their nature. Moreover, theantigen-specific tolerogenic T-lymphocytes mostly reside insidethe tumour tissue (57). Thus tolerogenic cells do not differfrom other memory T-lymphocytes that commonly circulatethrough the body, spending most time in their target tissue ( i.e. tumour). If T-cell growth factors are produced due to theinduction of an antitumour immune response, tolerogenicmemory T-lymphocytes are activated in the presence of thetumour antigen. These cells divide and respond as determinedby the transcriptions factors activated during immunological priming, and thus the recall antigens of vaccination result inmore tolerogenic memory cells. Figure 1 shows that therapeutic vaccination might amplify cells involved in both tumour tolerance and rejection, whichmight nullify the therapeutic efficacy. Some studies evensuggest that therapeutic vaccination is detrimental (58).Because of the functional stability of (tolerogenic) T-lymphocytes (54, 55, 59), little is expected from subtleblocking of a single co-stimulatory molecule. When clinical results are small, often the (antigenic) dose is increased or vaccination is repeated in order to induce morepowerful responses. Increasing the number of responsive T-lymphocytes, might be accompanied by a higher level oftolerogenic T-cells, because of higher cytokine levels at thetarget tissue. Therapeutic cancer vaccines induce antibodiesand cytotoxic T-lymphocytes against prostate cancer antigens.In the prophylactic setting, these immune responses are a goodpredictor of protection. However, in the therapeutic setting,vaccine-induced immune responses fail to be clinicallyeffective, presumably because of the ongoing presence ofantigen-specific tolerogenic lymphocytes that reside inside andnearby the tumour. III study targeting CTLA4 todeplete regulatory T-cells systemically yielded minimal resultswith serious toxicity (60). The problem is not simply thepresence of tumour at the moment of vaccination, sincetherapeutic vaccination strategy in patients with clearedtumours also yielded minimal results (61). Considering thattolerogenic lymphocytes are present that specifically areinstructed at the immunological recall site, i.e.the vaccine depot, this might not be a complete surprise to immunologists. In understanding the inefficacy of therapeutic vaccination, we would like to re-visit and deepen some questions. Howcan it be that vaccination is protective when applied in aprophylactic setting, but is not curative when applied in atherapeutic setting? In other words, what is the differencebetween immunological intervention in the prophylactic andthe therapeutic settings? Tumour-bearing differ fromhealthy persons in two properties, their immunological statusand, the presence of tumour as a ' de novo organ' that maintains tissue homeostasis. In other words: How can thisacquired immune-protected status of the tumour be broken? Immunotherapy Becoming Effective by Destroying Tumour Homeostasis Patients with cancer have acquired antigen-specific tolerance. Thus, how can we break tolerance and treat patients in aclinically effective way? Immunological tolerance to organscannot be broken easily, since if tolerance against organs is lostit would cause autoimmune disorders incompatible with life.Thus, studies should focus on neutralizing antigen-specifictolerance. But how can we do this, knowing the wide spectrumJacobs et al: Therapeutic Vaccines and Prostate Cancer (Review) 2693of tumour associated antigens? If only tolerance was broken of one or two antigens on the tumour, the tumour cells would remaining tolerogenic T-lymphocytes. Antigen-specific T-lymphocytes home preferentially to their target tissue (62, 63). They are crucial in maintainingtissue homeostasis (56) and depend on tissue homeostasisand antigens. In the case of tumour-bearing patients theantigen-specific T-lymphocytes are tolerogenic cells. Thus iftheir target tissue is destroyed, these tolerogenic cells mightbe open for immunological reinstruction or destruction. Many studies indicate that cancer immunotherapy other than therapeutic vaccination can lead to clinically relevanteffects [reviewed in (40)]. The crux to understanding tumourimmunology resides in understanding the mechanisms evokedby effective therapies. From a physiological point of view thetumour is a de novo organ, with quite normal homeostasis and absence of immunological danger (64, 65). The presence ofdanger is the key instruction for the immune system todiscriminate between tolerogenic and immunogenic responsestowards antigens. In the case of cancer the immune systemrecognizes danger by endogenous danger signals, i.e.the induction of cell death or inflammation. Thus immunologicaldanger could be induced in two different ways. Firstly, direct destruction of (a part of) the tumour would be read as immunological danger. Radiotherapy andchemotherapy are cytotoxic and destroy tumour homeostasis. Cell death induces the maturation of DCs in vitro , ex vivo and in vivo (66-68). DCs are crucial in initiating immune responses (69, 70). Animal models show that radiotherapyand chemotherapy may aid immunotherapy (71-76) and localradiotherapy can synergize with systemic anticancer treatment(77), as in prostate cancer (78). Chemotherapy, radiotherapyand hormone therapy induce antibodies and cellular immuneresponses against prostate cancer (76, 79, 80) and othertumours (74). A preliminary study has shown a therapeuticeffect in preventing cancer recurrence by the combination ofvaccination and irradiation (81). Induction of immunity couldbe important in the synergy between radiotherapy andchemotherapy with immunotherapy observed in the clinic forother tumour types (82-87). Research in an autologous animalmodel suggests that chemotherapy with cyclophosphamidecould synergize with immunotherapy (76), this was confirmedby a phase II clinical trial (88). Secondly, causing local inflammation can be seen as immunological danger. Local initiation is crucial in the normaldevelopment of immune responses. Many tumours deploylocal immune inhibition to maintain physiology (89);inflammatory killing of tumour cells could break this status quo (90, 91). Deliberate induction of intra-tumoural inflammation can induce T-lymphocytes (92, 93) or reprogramANTICANCER RESEARCH 34: 2689-2700 (2014) 2694 Figure 1. A: Default immune status at a tumour. B: Immune status after vaccination. C: Immune status after vaccination and co-stimulation . D: Immune status after local 'danger' therapy. Tr, Regulatory or suppressive T (tolerogenic) lymphocytes; homeostasis regulatory T-lymphocytes actively protect the tissue from (immunological) harm (A). When a patient is vaccinated (B) tolerogenic and effector responses both increase. The effector responses are the direct result of the vaccination, but the pres ence of antigen plus T- cell growth factors (Interleukin-2, and - 15) also increases the number of tolerogenic cells. Since both tolerogenic and effect or cells are increased in number and activity, the immunological awareness of the tumour is increased. Nevertheless, the tumour tissue remains activel y protected. Similarly when co-stimulated, both tolerogenic and immunogenic lymphocytes are amplified to a similar extent, since both populations are activated in the same environment (i.e. at the tumour site) with the same T-cell growth factors (i.e. cytokines). Thus populations of both cells will increase (C). The effective option seems to be to induce local inflammation signals, either directly by cytokines, or indirectly by inducing loca l 'danger' in the tissue (D). Tumour cell killing releases antigen in the presence of danger signals, e.g. due to dying cells. The tolerogenic T-lymphoc ytes are destroyed or re-instructed to become effector cells, allowing the installation of tumour immunity.regulatory T-lymphocytes in situ (59). Thus inducing intra- tumoural inflammation can be clinically effective againstcancer (94, 95). The principle of inducing inflammationagainst cancer has been successfully employed by BacillusCalmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) therapy for bladder carcinoma (96-100). Systemic BCG therapy would cause a life-threateningdisease, thus BCG is only applied locally. BCG inducesinflammation (101) by local mediators such as IL2 (102, 103).Local, rather than systemic IL2 is active against bladdercancer (104-107) and other forms of cancer (40, 41, 98, 108,109). These effects of IL2 are not attributable to systemic IL2,since only local treatment shows clinically relevant efficacyagainst nasopharyngeal carcinoma (83, 110) and metastasizedmelanoma (111-115). Local, rather than systemic immunestimulation is effective, as systemic immune stimulationinduces immunosuppressive feedback loops (40). Conclusion Vaccination has shown its clinical efficacy in theprophylactic setting, but not in the therapeutic setting.Therapeutic vaccination stimulates both immunogenic andtolerogenic responses, thereby nullifying its overall clinicalefficacy. Thus, vaccination might have immunologicaleffects, but little therapeutic effect. We hypothesize thatimmune protection might be due to tumour homeostasis,likely T-lymphocytes, such homeostasismight be overruled by immunological danger in twodifferent mechanisms. The first mechanism is by inductionof tumour death by locally-applied cytotoxic anticancertherapy; the second is by induction of inflammation insidethe tumour. Initiating local immune responses in the tumourseems to be required for effective anticancerimmunotherapy. Several studies have shown that this is apossible approach in the pre-clinical and clinical setting fora variety of tumour types. Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
