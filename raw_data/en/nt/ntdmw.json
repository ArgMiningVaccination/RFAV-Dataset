What if there was a quick and simple solution to boosting your immune system so you could better fight illness? The good news \u2014 BodyTalk treatments provide this benefit. What is your immune system? In order to understand how we can help our immune system, we need to understand how it works. Our immune system is made of organs, immune cells and proteins whose job is to fight outside invaders from entering the body (germs, bacteria, viruses and toxins). Secondary job of the immune system is peace keeping, which is tolerance of our environment, human cells (to prevent auto-immune conditions) and microbiome community (to prevent allergies and Intolerances). How does BodyTalk improve the immune system? BodyTalk treatments enhance and strengthen your body's immune system by strengthening and improving the pathways of communication that occur between your brain and your immune system. By doing this, your immune system can be more in tune with your body's needs, which will lead to extremely responsive defenses against illness, before it roots itself in the vulnerable regions of your body. Body chemistry technique of BodyTalk is designed to stimulate your immune system to address chronic and acute conditions like viruses, bacteria and other toxins. As well as balances the immune system for with addressing food intolerances and allergies. This kind of preventative measure is especially important if you are prone to illness (this includes infants, children and expecting mothers). What is BodyTalk exactly? BodyTalk is a consciousness-based, non-diagnostic therapy that works with the body in its healing process and stimulates the body's innate ability to balance and heal itself on all levels. It can be used as a stand-alone system that addresses a variety of health conditions or can be integrated into other healthcare systems to promote effective and faster healing. This approach is based on three simple principles: 1. The body can heal itself. BodyTalk utilizes what is known as the 'innate wisdom' of the body to heal itself in order to recover from any and all types of injury. Stress impacts overall health. Every experience a person goes through contributes to their overall health. Lifestyle, genetics, history, and environment all impact the body's functioning. Stresses produced by external factors can interfere with the natural communication systems within the body, often leading to emotional and physical health issues. The body communicates via energetic circuitry. Every aspect of our being\u2014cells, atoms, and neurons\u2014are in communication with each other constantly through energetic circuitry. Stress can compromise the circuitry systems and create chronic breakdown of communication. BodyTalk Practitioners strive to connect these broken lines and facilitate open communication between all of the elements of the body in order to promote healing from within.
