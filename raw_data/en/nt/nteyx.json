The transverse magnetization decay results as spins lose their coherence while they precess with slightly dierent Larmor frequencies in the transverse plane. The dispersion in frequencies in turn occurs when the spins precess in dierent magnetic elds. There are three causes for this eld variation [29].First, the external eld is not perfectly homogeneous and therefore varies slightly acrossthe sample. Second, each spin creates a magnetic dipole eld that aects the neighboringspins. This is commonly referred to as spin-spin interaction. Depending on the spin density distribution, the elds seen by the spins at dierent positions can be slightly dierent. Lastly, if spins move (diuse) within the sample in the presence of background magneticgradients 1, they experience a time varying eld. The end result of the three scenarios is that some of the spins acquire extra phase, which leads to de-phasing and consequently,loss of MR signal. In conventional MR, the transverse relaxation rate determines the amount of time avail- able for imaging between each 90-degree RF excitation pulse. In spin echo imaging of water, 1The background gradients can either be due to eld inhomogeneities or due to the externally applied gradients.61 for instance, one acquires one or two lines of k-space [59] after each 90-degree RF excita- tion.2Therefore, the T2relaxation rate of water presents a limit on the time available for imaging one line of k-space. Once the transverse polarization of water is lost, the longitu- dinal thermal polarization is allowed to growtowards its thermal equilibrium value. A new 90-degree RF pulse flips the magnetization again into the transverse plane so that a newline of k-space is collected. In contrast, the transverse relaxation rate of hyperpolarized gas determines the total time available for imaging in a spin echo sequence due to the nonrenewable nature of gas hyperpolarization. The longitudinal magnetization of hyperpolarized gas decays (rather thangrows) with a time constant T 1towards its thermal equilibrium. Hence, it does not pay o to wait after the transverse magnetization has decayed; the longitudinal magnetiza-tion will not recover to its initial hyper-value. To deal with the problem of nonrenewablepolarization, small flip-angle pulse-sequences have primarily been used [6, 68]. However, such pulse sequences make poor use of the available magnetization as each acquisition only uses a small fraction (sin , where is the flip-angle) of the available magnetization. Since the inherent transverse relaxation times of gases 3are an order of magnitude longer than for liquids [59], the entire k-space could be sampled using a single-shot (i.e, single 90-degree pulse) spin echo sequence. Such sequences should give a superior SNR compared to small flip-angle sequences because they use all the available magnetization ( =9 0)t oe n c o d e the image-domain data (see Section 4.6 for more details). In fact, imaging with the entiremagnetization vector versus a 12-degree projection of the initial magnetization increasesthe SNR by a factor of around 5 (sin90 /sin 125). This is equivalent to increasing the initial129Xe hyperpolarization from 5% to 25%-a goal that has proven to be very dicult to achieve. Our aim was to implement a single-shot spin echo imaging sequence (also called CPMG sequence, [69, 70], on the pulsed low-eld resistive MRscanner. wanted to investigate whether the resistive pulsed system wasstable enough to maintain the stringent phase stability required during the CPMG condi- tion. Studying T CPMG 2 relaxation enabled us to estimate the phase stability of the resistive scanner and to identify other potential problems of using the resistive system for spin echo 2K-space (or time-domain space) is the Fourier transform of image-domain space. 3The inherent transverse relaxation times should be understood as the transverse relaxation times result- ing exclusively from spin-spin interactions.62 imaging. Furthermore, by varying the interecho spacing in the CPMG spin echo sequence, we were able to dierentiate between the TCPMG 2 relaxation times and the inherent T2relaxation of gases. The TCPMG 2 relaxation characterizes the decay of a spin echo train in a particular magnetic environment and thus includes diusion losses in the background gradients, whilethe inherent T 2relaxation times of gases are purely the property of the gas mixture used. The inherent T2times of129Xe and3He mixtures used in the hyperpolarized gas experiments are a useful measure of the absolute limit on the imaging time when using a CPMG sequence. To the best of our knowledge, past experiments measuring the transverse relaxation times of129Xe and3He [47, 71, 72, 26, 73, 28, 74, 75, 76, 77] did not remove the eects of diusion losses in the static background (remnant) gradients. The values of T2relaxation times quoted in the literature are thus comparable to what we call TCPMG 2 relaxation, and not to the inherent T2relaxation. Apart from the non-renewable nature of the noble gas polarization, large diusion of gases is another factor that makes imaging of hyperpolarized gas dicult, and more impor-tantly, dictates pulse-sequence design. Diusion of spins through magnetic eld gradientscauses loss of NMR signal and limits the maximum achievable resolution. The reduced sus-ceptibility eect and smaller magnetic eld heterogeneities at low elds should help decrease signal loss due to diusion in our low-eld system. However, in order to predict MR signal loss during imaging with spin echo and/or gradient echo sequences, we had to evaluate thediusion coecient of hyperpolarized gases on our system. Diusion coecients for 129Xe and3Hein vitro have been al. [78] performed measurements of129Xe diusion coecient while Bock et al. al. [80] measured diusion coef- cient of3He. However, all these measurements were done using low flip-angle techniques (gradient echo, DANTE) which suer from poor SNR and are limited by T1relaxation. Some fast sequences, such as BURST from Wolber et al. [81] and Peled et al. [82] avoided the problem of T1relaxation, but had a complicated spin dynamics. Mair et al. [83] and Zhaoet al. [77] established the advantage of high SNR techniques based on multiple spin echo sequences (RARE, CPMG). These techniques enable the use of multiple diusive at- tenuations within a single sequence and thus allow the measurement of time-dependant (orrestricted) gas diusion [83]. However, to remove diusion losses in the background gradi-ents from the total signal decay, the experiments in [83] and [77] required two shots (i.e.,63 two separate CPMG trains) as well as the normalization of the echo train against the rst echo. Two (or multi) shot spin echo sequences are impractical in the case of hyperpolarizedgases because of the non-renewable gas polarization. Our single-shot CPMG sequence for measuring diusion coecient uses all the available magnetization and thus has inherently high SNR. In addition, the chosen sequence enabledus to separate T CPMG 2 relaxation of the gas from diusive loses in the external gradients. Finally, by comparing the experimental measurement of3He,129Xe and water diusion coecients with theoretical estimations, we were able to determine the precision of our single-shot CPMG sequence for measuring diusion coecients.64 4.2 Theory of Transverse (T2) Relaxation As mentioned in Section 4.1, the transverse component of magnetization decays due to magnetic fluctuations which cause spreading in the Larmor frequency of the spin ensem- ble and, consequently, dephasing. The rate of decay of the transverse component Mxyis proportional to the instantaneous value of the transverse magnetization, dMxy dt=Mxy T 2, (4.1) where the transverse relaxation coecient T 2includes the relaxation due to static magnetic eld inhomogeneities, TBz, the inherent relaxation due to spin-spin interactions, T2,a n d relaxation due to the diusion of spins in the magnetic eld gradients, TD.4To summarize: 1 T 2=1 TBz+1 T2+1 TD. (4.2) Later in the chapter we will show how to separate the 1 /TBzterm from the rest of relax- ation using spin echoes. Once that is accomplished, we proceed to identify the 1 /TDterm and distinguish it from the inherent 1 /T2relaxation of hyperpolarized gases (129Xe ad3He). The 90-degree excitation ( Mxy(0) = M), is Mxy=Met/T 2. (4.3) Equation 4.3 describes the macroscopic behavior of the transverse component of the mag- netization. However, to understand how the above relationship arises as a result of the microscopic motion of magnetic moments, one has to consider the equations of motion of the individual spins and then average over the spin population. The magnetic eld seen by the jth spin is Bj=(B+bj)k, where Bkis the static magnetic eld pointing in the z-direction and bjkis the z component of the eld fluctuations seen by the jth spin.5For mobile (i.e., diusing) spins, bjis time-varying. The equation of 4It should be pointed out that most books on the subject of MR relaxation dene Eq. 4.1 in terms of T2 and not T 2as is done here. 5This discussion assumes that only those fluctuations in bjthat are parallel to Bcause variations in Larmor frequency and therefore transverse relaxation. This approximation is invalid when dealing with longitudinal relaxation or non-adiabatic transverse relaxation.65 motion for the jth magnetic moment is \u00b5j=\u00b5j\u00d7Bj=\u00b5j\u00d7[B+bj(t)]k. (4.4) Combining the x and y transverse components of the magnetic moment into a single complex \u00b5, such that \u00b5j=\u00b5j,x+\u00b5j,y, the equations of motion become \u00b5j(t)=i[B+bj(t)]\u00b5j(t). (4.5) After integration, the above equation gives \u00b5j(t) = exp( iBt)exp/bracketleftbigg i/integraldisplayt 0bj()d/bracketrightbigg \u00b5j(0), the initial magnetization of the jth spin. To get the total transverse magne- tization, we have to sum over N the initial value of the magnetic moment \u00b5j(0) is independent of its local eld bjthe initial magnetization can be factored out: M(0) =1 VN/summationdisplay j=1\u00b5j(0). (4.9) By also factoring out the exponential representing the precession around Beld, the com- plex the transverse magnetization, also called the Free-Induction-Decay (FID). The rst term represents the oscillatory part of the FID-theoscillation of magnetization around B , with the characteristic Larmor frequency =B,66 where is the gyromagnetic ratio of the spin. The last term is the initial value of magne- tization. The term in the curly brackets is the envelope of the FID-the relaxation of thetransverse magnetization. Let us look more closely at the relaxation part of the FID. The time integral over the magnetic fluctuations seen by the jth particle in Eq. 4.10 can be related to the accumulated phase angle j(t), where j(t)=/integraldisplayt 0b()d. (4.11) The average over the population of particles can then be written as F(t)=1 NN/summationdisplay P[(t)]dis the probability that a spin had accumulated a phase between and+d in a time t. To solve Eq. 4.13, we have to assume a functional form for the probability function. Since the spin samples many dierent elds over a short time, we can invoke the Central Limit Theorem [29]. The probability distribution of phase angles can thus bedescribed using a Gaussian function, with zero mean angle and a mean square width of /angbracketleft 2/angbracketright: P()=1 (2/angbracketleft2/angbracketright)1 2exp/parenleftBigg 2 2/angbracketleft2/angbracketright/parenrightBigg . of the FID signal, using a Gaussian distribution for the spin phase angles, is F(t)=1 (2/angbracketleft2/angbracketright)1 2/integraldisplay exp/parenleftBigg 2 2/angbracketleft2/angbracketright/parenrightBigg exp(i)d. (4.15) The integral above can be evaluated by completing the square of the arguments of the exponentials. The result is F(t) T 2/bracketrightbigg . (4.16) To make further progress on the equation above would require us to know the mean square width of the phase angles sampled by the spins. Nevertheless, by starting with the equation of motion for the individual spins (Eq. 4.4) and then averaging over the spin67 population, we were able to show that the transverse magnetization can be expressed as M(t)=M(0)exp F(t) is given by Eq. 4.16. We will return to this equation as well as Eq. 4.10 in the following chapters when describing the eects of magnetic eld inhomogeneities and the eect of diusion on transverse relaxation.68 4.3 Reversible T2 Decay Equation 4.2 tells us that part of the transverse relaxation is due to the inhomogeneities in the main magnetic eld. Spins at dierent positions in the sample dephase because they see a dierent eld. Fortunately, the magnetization lost due to dephasing in an inhomogeneousmagnet can be recovered using the technique of spin echoes. 4.3.1 Magnet Inhomogeneities and Spin Echoes The easiest way to understand the occurrence of a spin echo is to draw on the analogybetween the spins precessing in an inhomogeneous magnetic eld and runners running withdierent speeds on a track course. Imagine the runners started running at the same timeand place on the track. After some time tinto the run, the runners will be spread along the course of the run, with the fastest runner furthest away from the start and the slowest one the closest. If at time t, the runners are made to turn back (i.e., reverse direction of running by 180 ) and if they continue to run at the same speed, they will all reach the start at the same time, namely, at time 2 t. The distance by which the fastest runner was ahead of the slowest one before time t, he gets behind after time t; what used to be an advantage turned into a disadvantage. Similarly, the spins in a higher magnetic eld precess faster than the spins in the lower magnetic eld. After a time t, the fast spins will have gained an additional of phase relative to the slow spins. If the sense of spin precession is reversed at time t(with a 180-degree pulse), then the spins will again have the same phase at time 2 t. In other words, the coherence of spins will be fully restored at time 2 t. To demonstrate the concept of spin echoes formally, we return to Eq. 4.10, representing the behavior of transverse magnetization at time t, where bj(t) is the magnetic eld variation seen by the jth particle. It is best to transform this equation to the rotating frame of reference. In the rotating frame, the Larmor precession is time tabout an axis in the transverse plane, all spins will be rotated through a 180-degree angle and the net complex magnetization vector Mwill69 z Mz MSz z MM Figure 4.1: Creation of a spin echo. be transformed into its complex conjugate M(Figure 4.1).6Therefore, after a 180-degree rotation, spins continue to precess in the same sense they did before the application of the pulse (in the runners' case, this would correspond to saying that the runners continue to runforward after they have turned around at time t), then, after an additional time t 1, they will acquire an extra phase, exp/parenleftBig i/integraltextt+t1 tbj()d/parenrightBig , and the complex transverse the eld from 0 to tand from ttot+t1will not cancel out because spins diuse randomly in the magnetic eld. However, for stationary7 spins, the integrals reduce can most easily be seen by xing the axis of rotation and looking at the transformation of mag- netization components under the 180-degree rotation. If the magnetization rotated by 180around the x-axis, for instance, then: MxMx,MyMy,MzMz. From this transformation we see that the complex magnetization ( Mx+iMy) transforms into its conjugate ( MxiMy) a 180-degree rotation around x, similarly for a 180-degree rotation around y-axis. 7Stationary spins are spins that do not move out of a voxel of size ( a)3,w h e r e ais the resolution of MR imaging system.70 Ift=t1, then M(2t)=M(0). This means that for stationary spins, the initial magnetiza- tion has been fully recovered at time 2 t. For diusing spins, however, the echoes will still occur, but with progressively smaller amplitudes. The decay of the echoes due to diusion will be examined in the next chapter. In addition to signal loss due to diusion of spins, the 180-degree pulses in the echo sequence do not refocus the eects of spin-spin interaction. To see this, we return toEq. 4.18. For spin-spin interaction (see Section 4.4.2), the source of magnetic eld b jare the magnetic dipoles rather than the external eld. By rotating the magnetization 180, the magnetic dipoles and, therefore, the sources of the eld inhomogeneity, are rotated as well. This means that in addition to converting the magnetization in Eq. 4.18 into itsconjugate, the sign of b jneeds to be inverted. Consequently, the two exponentials do not cancel out-and the magnetization which was lost through the local elds of dipolar origincannot be recovered [29]. Using the technique of spin echoes one can thus distinguish between the relaxation due to instrumentational limitations (i.e., inhomogeneous holding magnetic eld) and relaxationinherent to the system (i.e., spin-spin interaction and diusion). In other words, the 1 /T Bz term can be factored out of Eq. 4.2, so that 1 T 2=1 TBz+1 TCPMG 2, (4.22) where the TCPMG 2 time constant describes the rate of spin echo decay resulting from the inherent T2relaxation and diusion losses8, T2 Decay The T2 relaxation which occurs due to magnetic eld inhomogeneities can be removed using spin echo techniques. We call such relaxation a reversible T2decay. The spin-spin interactions and diusion, on the other hand, contribute to an irreversible T2 decay, which will be examined in detail in this section. 4.4.1 Diusion We present two alternative approaches in deriving an expression for signal decay due todiusion of spins in the eld gradients. The rst approach is statistical, based on therandom walk of spins [59]. This approach illustrates the statistical nature of spins, but iscumbersome and limited to the case of constant gradients. The second approach is based on the generalized Bloch equation, which has two extra terms as compared to the standard Bloch equation-a term describing the transport of magnetization due to flow and a termdescribing the random transport of magnetization due to diusion [59]. This approach isless intuitive, but has the advantage of being elegant and applicable to an arbitrary gradientform. 4.4.1.1 Statistical Approach to Signal Decay due to Diusion in Constant Gra- dients The goal is to nd the average square phase shift 2(Eq. 4.16) for spins diusing randomly through a constant gradient. If the motion is limited to one dimension, then the frequency ofprecession of such spins is (t)=B +Gx, where xis the average distance that a particle travels in time t.I ft i m e tis divided into nsteps, each of duration s, then t=ns.D u r i n g each step, the particle jumps either left or right with equal probability, so that ai=\u00b11. If the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) displacement in one dimension is , then the distance z travelled by the molecule after n jumps (4.26) we get z2(t)=2tD. (4.27) The above equation relates the macroscopic mean square displacement of a diusing parti- clez2and the diusion constant D. For three-dimensional molecular motion, the factor 2 in Eq. 4.27 should be replaced by 6. Let us go back to the equation describing the frequency of precession. Replacing xwith z(ns), we have (ns)=B+Gn/summationdisplay the above equation we used the equality/summationtextn i=1(n+1i)2=/summationtextn j=1j2. If the average square phase shift is inserted into Eq. 4.16, we obtain an expression for the relaxation of the FID signal which results exclusively from the diusion of spins in a constant gradient: F(t) 32G2Dt3/parenrightbigg . (4.31)73 If a 180-degree RF pulse reverses the orientation of spins in the magnetic eld gradients at time t, the spins begin to re-phase, until they are fully re-phased and an echo is formed at time 2 t(see Section 4.3.1). The re-phasing of spins decreases the net eect of diusion losses. In other words, if spins were allowed to diuse in a positive (constant) gradient for a time 2 t, the diusion losses would be proportional to exp/bracketleftBig 1 32G2D(2t)3/bracketrightBig . However, since thepulse reverses the sign of the magnetic eld gradients seen by the spins at time t, the echo magnitude at time 2 twill be M(2t)= echo expressed as M(T)=M(0)exp/parenleftbigg 1 122G2D(T)3/parenrightbigg . (4.33) 4.4.1.2 Signal Decay due to Diusion in an Arbitrary Gradient Waveform Based on the Bloch Equation The generalized Bloch equation for the Mx-coordinate is dMx dt=MyBeffMx T2+\u00b7/vectorD\u00b7Mx\u00b7 /vectorvMx. (4.34) The rst term on the right hand side is due to the rotation of the magnetization around the eective eld Beff=/parenleftBig B /parenrightBig +r\u00b7g, where g=Bz/xdx+Bz/ydy+Bz/zdz is the magnetic eld gradient and r=x+y+zis the position of the spin with respect to an arbitrary origin; the second term represents the inherent T2relaxation; the third term stands for relaxation due to diusion of spins in the magnetic eld gradients; the fourth andlast term represents relaxation due to the directional transport (i.e., flow) of magnetization. 9 By exchanging the subscript xin Eq. 4.34 with yand vice versa, one can obtain a similar 9We choose to include the 'flow' term in the Bloch equation to illustrate the most general situation. Our in vitro experiments did not include flow; however, when modelling an in vivo situation, such as delivery of hyperpolarized gas to the lungs through inhalation, the relaxation due to the flow of magnetization shouldbe taken into introducing a complex magnetization M+=Mx+iMy. Furthermore, on resonance, =B, and the eective eld D00 00D \u00b7M+=D2M+. (4.37) In addition, for spatially independent velocities, the flow term in the Bloch equation becomes \u00b7/vectorvM+=(\u00b7/vectorv)M++/vectorv\u00b7M+=/vectorv\u00b7M+. (4.38) Assuming a solution of the form M+(r,t)=A(t)exp/bracketleftbigg ir\u00b7/integraldisplayt 0g()d/bracketrightbigg exp/bracketleftbigg t T2/bracketrightbigg , (4.39) and substituting Eq. 4.36, we exponential on the right side of the above equation represents the signal decay due to diusion, while the second exponential represents the signal decay due to flow. We will focus on the rst term only. Since k 2/integraltextt/prime 0g()d[59], we can express the diusion term tells us that by knowing the diusion constant of the gas mixture and the integral of the gradient waveform over time, one can nd TDand as a result eliminate the signal decay due to diusion from the total decay (see Eq. 4.2). 4.4.2 Spin-Spin Interaction The theory of spin-spin interaction is very complex and can only be explained using thequantum mechanical description of nuclear interactions. We therefore limit this section tooutlining the main steps in the derivation of T 2as described in [59] . There are several processes which to dephasing of transverse magnetiza- tion [59]: the dipolar interaction between a pair of spins, chemical shift interaction, scalar coupling, and the quadrupole interaction (for I>1/2). For spin-1/2 nuclei, the dominant interaction causing spin relaxation arises from the dipolar sum refers to all the spin pairs (i,j), Iis the vector operator given by Ixx+Iyy+Izz, andrijis the distance between two spins. If we introduce a density matrix , where for a spin-1/2 particle the density matrix is = 1 2+/angbracketleftIz/angbracketright/angbracketleftIxiIy/angbracketright /angbracketleftIx+iIy/angbracketright1 2/angbracketleftIz/angbracketright , (4.44) then the evolution of the density matrix in the rotating frame of reference can be expressed as id(t) dt=[H D(t),(t)], (4.45) s transformed [ iIzt], and is the Larmor frequency. Once the evolution of in Eq. 4.45 is calculated, the decay of transverse relaxation can76 be determined. From [59], the transverse spectral density functions dened in terms of the Relaxation with Free-Induction-Decay The largest contribution to T 2relaxation is dephasing due to external eld inhomogeneities (see Eq. 4.2), which can be removed using the technique of spin echoes. Consequently, T 2does not give any information about the system under study (hyperpolarized gas, for instance); it only describes how well one is able to shimthe external magnet. To minimize the external eld inhomogeneities, FID signals (which decay with time constant T 2,s e e Eq. 4.16) were collected prior to any other signal acquisition. Shimming currents wereapplied to the x,y,a n d zgradient coils in order to maximize T 2relaxation time. From the frequency domain perspective (see Appendix B), this translated into minimizing the linewidth of the frequency spectrum. In addition to shimming, the FID signal was used to match the receiver frequency to the frequency of transmission (and therefore, precession). Special care was devoted to beingwithin a few Hertz of the precession frequency to avoid o-resonance eects. S/2 RF Signal Acquisition window Figure 4.2: Pulse sequence used to generate free-induction-decay, or FID. Figure 4.2 shows the basic structure of the pulse sequence used to generate free-induction- decay. The duration of the RF pulse determines the angle by which the magnetization has been tipped away from the static eld (so-called \"flip-angle\"). If the amplitude of the RFeld is B 1and the frequency of precession around the B1eld is 1=d/dt, then the flip-angle dis d=B1dt. (4.48) Normally, the flip-angle is chosen to be 90(i.e.,/2) to maximize the projection of mag- netization onto the transverse plane and, therefore, the SNR.78 0 0.5 1 1.5 22000200400 Time (s)FID Signal (a.u.) 500 0 5000500100015002000 Frequency (kHz)FT of FID Signal (a.u.) Figure 4.3: Free-induction-decay (FID) signal of water taken on the low-eld pulsed resistive scanner (top) and its Fourier transform (bottom). Figure 4.3 shows a typical FID signal of distilled water and its spectra, which is obtained by taking the Fourier transform (FT) of the time domain signal. Since the FT of an exponential decay is a Lorentzian (see Appendix B), we can t the data to the function of the form L(x)=1 1 2 ()2+/parenleftBig 1 2/parenrightBig2, (4.49) where is the FWHM (Full-Width-Half-Maximum) value and is the central frequency of the t. From Appendix B, the T 2relaxation time is T The typical linewidth (FWHM) of water,129Xe and3He frequency spectra at 397 kHz central frequency was between 5 and 15 Hz. The T 2relaxation rate for all samples was thus between 20 ms and 60 ms. Since the FID was collected from the entire sample (i.e., a sphere of diameter x, where x=2.5 cm), the typical background gradients due to the eld inhomogeneities were G=f/(x)=0.010.03 mT/m. 4.5.1 Determination of Gas Polarization Water and gas spectra were also used for calibrating the noble gas polarization. As demon- strated in Eq. 3.4, the NMR signal is proportional to the magnetization of the sample and the frequency at which the signal was acquired (i.e., readout frequency). The magnetiza- tion of the sample can be expressed in terms of the polarization as M=Pn\u00b5, where nis the number density of the sample and \u00b5is its magnetic moment. Therefore, SHypGas proton number density and\u00b5pis the proton magnetic moment. By measuring the ratio of the hyperpolarized gas and water signals which were acquired at the same readout frequency, the noble gas(hyper)polarization can be evaluated from P HypGas =PH2Onp nHypGas\u00b5p \u00b5HypGasSHypGas SH2O. (4.52) The ratio of magnetic can be determined immediately: \u00b5p=2.793\u00b5N,\u00b5Xe= 0.780\u00b5N,a n d \u00b5He=2.127\u00b5N, where \u00b5Nis the nuclear magnetic moment. Therefore, \u00b5p/\u00b5Xe=3.58 and \u00b5p/\u00b5He=1.31. The number density is commonly expressed in units of amagat , which is dened as the number density per standard atmosphere ( p=1a t m , T= 273 K). Thus, from the ideal gas law (pV=nRT, where Ris the universal gas constant), 1 amagat = 44 .50 mol /m3.F o r follows that80 nH2O= 1244 .69 amagats. Because there are two protons in each water molecule, the proton number density is np= 2489 .4 amagats. For hyperpolarized gas, the number density in amagats is a function of the gas pressure pHypGas normalized to 1 atm; the temperature of the gas when the cells were lled, THypGas , normalized to 273 K; and the abundance gas in 0 .48 atm of nat- urally abundant129Xe (FXe=2 6.44% = 2 .644\u00d7103) at room temperature (300 K). The 129Xe number density in the cell was thus nXe=0.115 amagats. The helium cell used for all the hyperpolarized3He experiments was lled with 0 .74 atm of pure3He (F= 100% = 1) at room temperature. Therefore, the number density of3He in the cell was nHe=0.6825 am- agats.

All pressures measured at room temperature. The thermal polarization of water protons is equal to the fraction of protons which are in the lower energy state , N/Ntotal, minus the fraction of protons that are in the upper energy state, N/Ntotal: Pthermal H2O=NN N+N. (4.55) Using the Boltzmann distribution, we can express the number of protons in the lower energy state in terms of the number of protons in magnetic elds Bthe hyperbolic tangent can be expanded in a power series. If only the rst power term is kept, the thermal polarization becomes P\u00afhB 2kT=\u00b5pB kT, (4.58) since E=2\u00b5pB=\u00afhB for a spin 1/2 particle. Notice that \u00b5p=8.8\u00d71011eV/mT, kT=0.0258 eV at room temperature, and B= 397 kHz /42.58kHz mT. The thermal po- larization of water at room temperature and 397 kHz readout frequency is thus PH2O= 3.18\u00d7108. It only remains to evaluate the ratio of hyperpolarized gas and water signals. We col- lected FID signals of distilled water using no polarizing waveform, so that the signal wasentirely due to the thermal polarization at the readout frequency (397 kHz). Since thelongitudinal relaxation time-which characterizes the rate of growth of thermal polarizationin the applied magnetic eld-was measured to be around 2.4 s for distilled water, we started signal acquisition approximately 3 T 1or 7 s after the application of the readout pulse. This \"waiting period\" enabled the protons to reach thermal equilibrium levels before the collec-tion of the FID signal. The hyperpolarized gas and water FID signals were collected using90-degree flip-angles for maximum SNR. Both water and hyperpolarized FID signals were Fourier transformed into the frequency domain and then analyzed using Matlab. First, the DC background level of both spectra was estimated using a linear t through the noise tails (see Figure 4.4 and 4.5) and thensubtracted from the main signal magnitude. This procedure removed any undesired im-pulse which could have appeared in the time domain signal at t= 0 as a result of electronic circuitry. 10The areas under the gas and water spectral curves were then estimated by inte- grating the spectral function from one noise tail to the other. Finally, the gas polarization was estimated using Eq. 4.52. We also compared the noise levels of water and hyperpolarized gas signals. In principle, 10One possible source of the impulse at t= 0 is the digital lter which could be coupling the switching noise into the AD converter.82 396.9 396.95 397 397.05 397.10200040006000800010000 SignalXenon Signal 4.4: Xenon and water spectra used xenon 396.95 397 397.05 Water Signal Helium Signal Figure 4.5: Helium and water spectra used to calibrate helium polarization levels.83 if the water and gas signals were obtained on the same day, under the same conditions, the noise levels of both signals should have been comparable in size, because the dominantsource of noise at the readout frequency of 397 kHz was the coil, which was the same for both samples. Therefore, a mismatch in the water and gas noise levels could indicate that the low-eld pulsed resistive system response has changed after the collection of onespectra and before the collection of the other. One possibility is phase noise, which is aconsequence of variations in the phase of the readout magnet that result when the magnetheats up. Unfortunately, phase noise is a function of signal size and thus can change the SNR response of the system. It is thus impossible to retroactively correct the signal size by scaling the signals with the ratio of noise levels. The noise levels of water andhyperpolarized gas in our measurements were within 70% of each other, which means thatthe ratio of hyperpolarized gas and water areas is at best 30% accurate. The errors inestimating other factors in Eq. 4.52 are negligible compared to the error in the estimation of the areas. The calibration of noble gas polarization is thus 30% accurate. This level of accuracy was satisfactory, since our goal at Stanford was not precise polarimetry, but toexplore the versatile function of the low-eld pulsed resistive system in imaging water andhyperpolarized gas. Figure 4.4 shows 129Xe and water spectra plotted on the same scale, while Figure 4.5 shows3He and water spectra. The typical129Xe polarization after 5 min of pumping with 7 W of circularly polarized laser power was between 2% and 7%, while after 30 min ofpumping with 7 W of laser power we were able achieve polarizations of around 1% for 3He. 4.5.2 Adiabatic Condition for Spin Transition in the Pulsed Scanner Unlike water, which requires a polarizing eld to increase its thermal polarization levels,the hyperpolarized gas polarization is created by the optical pumping process and thus doesnot require a polarizing waveform in the pulse sequence. Therefore, in the hyperpolarizedgas experiments, only the readout eld B was used. However, due to its pulsed nature, the readout eld is constantly turned onandoduring imaging. While o, the noble gas magnetization is aligned with the Earth's eld, which in the low-eld pulsed resistive scanner is not parallel to the readout eld. In contrast, during the onstate, the magnetization aligns with the readout eld which is two orders of magnitude bigger than the Earth's eld.

Right: magnetization alignment after the application of Beld. An adiabatic transition between the two states is required to prevent polarization loss. We now compute the maximum ramping speed of the readout eld allowed by the adiabatic condition. The adiabatic condition dictates the rate of change of the angle between the Earth's eld BEand the eective eld Beff(t) (Figure 4.7). In the worst-case scenario, the Earth's eld and the readout eld are orthogonal.11The angle between BeffandBE can be expressed in terms of the time-varying readout eld B=tBmax/Tramp, where Bmax is the saturation value of the readout eld and Trampis the time it takes the readout eld to reach its saturation value (see Figure (4.60) The transition will be adiabatic if the frequency of precession around the eective magnetic eld is much bigger than the rate of change of . Therefore, (t)/lessmuchBeff, where Beff=/bracketleftBig B2 (t)+B2 E/bracketrightBig1/2 11Even Earth's eld was readout eld in the low-eld pulsed resis- tive scanner, the worst-case scenario is a valid scenario at the beginning of the ramping period, when B(t<0) = 0. The readout eld ramping time which we derive in this section can be viewed as an upper limit on the ramping time that allows an adiabatic change of magnetization alinement. The ramping time could be shorter if we created a special readout-eld pulse.85 T(t)Bo(t)= tBmax/TrampBeff A vectorial of the hyperpolarized gas magnetization transition during the ramping of the readout eld.

(4.62) Worst case occurs when t=0 mT. Hence, Tramp=200 ms for3He =600 ms for129Xe. (4.64) The results tell us that the magnetization will change adiabatically if the initial ramp-up time of the readout eld is at least 200 ms long for3He and 600 ms long for129Xe. However, Trampis limited by the magnet rise-up time L/R, where LandRare the coil's inductance86 and resistance, respectively. For the readout magnet, the rise-up time is approximately 50 ms-a time too short for the adiabatic transition of hyperpolarized gas magnetization. Adierent method was thus needed to achieve an adiabatic sweep. The problem was solved by applying a small oset current to the readout magnet in order to dominate the Earth's eld and prevent the angle change during the ostate of the readout eld. The situation is illustrated on the right side of Figure 4.7. In this newoperational mode, the readout magnet was never completely o-it was either on a high mode setting (which determines the readout frequency) or on a low mode setting (typically, 1 mT). A modied pulse sequence is shown in Figure 4.8. 180 180 90 RFBo(t) a typical PMRI pulse sequence with a modied Bwave- form. Unlike in the diagram of Figure 3.2, the Bis now on a low-eld setting before the application of the Bppulse. To demonstrate experimentally that a fraction of polarization is lost without the low eld enabled during the omode of the readout magnet, we performed measurements of FID amplitude with and without the background (low) eld present. We observed anywherebetween 30% to 70% loss in hyperpolarized magnetization when the low-eld setting was disabled. The wide spread in measurements was due to our inability to control precisely the parameters which aect the initial value of the gas magnetization, such as the time ittakes to walk the cell from the pumping setup into the imaging scanner. Using this methodwe were also not able to determine accurately the minimal value of the low eld required toprevent magnetization losses. Instead, we performed an experiment which gave a negative87 result (i.e., no signal) when the low eld was on, and a positive result (i.e., signal) when t h el o w e l dw a s o.

The experiment relied on the creation of a spin echo using a 180-degree pulse, a technique we described in Section 4.3.1. Figure 4.9 shows the sequence used in the experiment. Notice that there is no 90-degree pulse in this sequence, which would normally flip the magnetization from the z-axis on to the xy plane. Nevertheless, a spin echo was createdafter the 180-degree pulse. This indicated the presence of transverse magnetization beforethe (non-adiabatic) ramp-up of the B eld. On the other hand, if the low-eld setting was88 enabled, the magnetization was aligned entirely along the z-direction before the ramp-up of the Beld, and consequently, no echo was formed. A small \"crusher\" (i.e., destructive) gradient was applied to destroy the FID signal which would result from an imperfect 180- degree pulse. Figure 4.10 shows the results of spin echo experiments, conrming the need for the low- eld setting during the omode of the readout eld cycle. When the low eld was smaller than 0.1 mT (twice the Earth's eld), an echo was created, which proves that transversemagnetization existed before the ramp-up of B eld. This transverse magnetization would have either been lost after the non-adiabatic ramp-up or, in the case of spin echo sequence, could contribute to the creation of stimulated echoes. From the results in Figure 4.10 wewere able to conclude that the minimum (critical) eld needed to prevent polarization losswas 0.1 mT. The low eld used in our experiments was 1 mT, which is well above the criticalvalue.89 4.6 Measurements of Irreversible Transverse Relaxation Signaltime(S/2)x (S)y (S)yTE Figure 4.11: Pulse sequence to generate a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill echo train. The irreversible T2relaxation, given by the Eq. 4.23, describes the decay of a spin echo train in a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence. The basic sequence used to create a spinecho train is illustrated in Figure 4.11. First, a 90-degree pulse was applied along one of thetransverse axis (either x or y). A time TE/2 later, a 180-degree pulse was applied along the other transverse axis (either y or x). The 180-degree pulse flips the spins in the transverse plane (around either y or x axis) and causes a spin echo to appear at time TEafter the application of the 90-degree pulse. By reapplying the 180-degree pulses in equally spacedintervals of length TE, an echo gets created each time at a half point ( TE/2) between the 180-degree pulses. Since TEequals the length between two successive echoes, it is also called \"interecho time\". The axis of rotation of the 180-degree pulses (which is related to the phase of the RF pulses) has to be parallel to the orientation of magnetization [29].For instance, after the application of a 90-degree pulse which rotates the spins around thex-axis, the spins are aligned along the y-axis; consequently, the 180-degree pulses have to beapplied along the y-axis. This algorithm prevents the accumulation of errors from imperfect 180-degree pulses. Figure 4.12 shows an example of 3He and129Xe spin echo trains obtained on the low- eld pulsed resistive scanner. Each plot contains 32 echoes. The interecho time for3He was 57.03 ms, while the TE for129Xe was 67.34 ms.

The TE values were chosen so that we could display clearly the TCPMG 2 relaxation experienced by the gas during the acquisition window. To extract the TCPMG 2 time constant from the echo trains such as the ones shown in Figure 4.12, we perform a least-square t to the logarithm of the data.12The t is a straight line of the form ln(S)=t TCPMG 2+l nSy=tk+n, (4.65) where y=l nSis the natural log of the average (mean) echo magnitude, which was obtained by integrating the area under each echo; n=l nSis the natural log of the initial echo magnitude; and k=1/TCPMG 2 is the relaxation rate of the spin echo train in the CPMG sequence. Figure 4.13 shows experimental data as well as the t to the data (using Eq. 4.65)of average echo magnitude as a function of time during a CPMG sequence. The T CPMG 2 relaxation time obtained from the t was 49.5 s. Measurements of TCPMG 2 showed a strong dependence of TCPMG 2 relaxation time on the interecho time TE. Consequently, unique3He and129XeTCPMG 2 relaxation times do not exist. However, the dependence of TCPMG 2 on the interecho time is important for determining the inherent T2relaxation rate of gases, which is the subject of Section 4.8. In that section we study the functional dependence of TCPMG 2 onTEand develop a method for extracting the inherent T2relaxation time from the TCPMG 2 data. In the following two subsections we examine in more detail two common problems en- 12In Matlab, the least-square algorithm is implemented into the function polyt which we used for tting the data.91 0 10 20 3066.26.46.66.8 Time (s)Log (Mean Echo Magnitude) Figure 4.13: A logarithmic plot of the average measured129Xe spin echo magnitude as a function of time and best t to the data.

The magnitude of B 1eld in Eq. 4.48 is a function of the shape and size of the RF coil, the strength of the current in the coil, and the position of the sample within the coil. If the sample llsthe coil (i.e., the coil ts tightly around the sample), the magnitude ofB1can vary signicantly across the sample. For all these reasons, the magnitude of B1 is not known ap r i o r i and the flip-angle calibration has to be determined experimentally. The common procedure is to look for a null in the FID signal-a result of a 180-degree flip- while systematically increasing the duration of the B1pulse. However, this method is not practical for hyperpolarized gases since ( Msin) of noble gas magnetization is destroyed after each -degree pulse. We therefore always calibrate the RF pulses on a water phantom and then scale the duration of the B1pulse by the ratio of gas and water gyromagnetic moments. For a flip-angle , the duration of the B1eld in the case of hyperpolarized gas,92 THyp Gas , and in the case of TH2O , are related by 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 x 1030200400600800100012001400 B1 pulse width (ms)FID magnitude (a.u.) Figure 4.14: Measurement of FID magnitude as a function of B1pulse duration. Figure 4.14 is an example of RF pulse calibration. It displays the magnitude of the FID signal at time t= 0 as a function of B1pulse width. As predicted from Mxy=M|sin(B1T)|, (4.67) the dependence of the FID magnitude on the B1pulse width is sinusoidal. The maximum FID values correspond to odd multiples of /2( 9 0and 270), while the nulls correspond to even multiples of /2 (180and 360). Measurements such as this one enabled us to determine the width of B1for any flip-angle. One of the implication in using the above-described calibration procedure is that any error in measuring the width of the 180-degree pulses translated into an error in the RFflip-angle. The accuracy in determining the width of a 180-degree pulse when looking fora null in the FID signal was \u00b11\u00b5s. The width of the 180-degree pulse depended on the signal attenuation used in producing the magnitude of B 1pulse. With the attenuation most commonly used, the length of 180-degree pulse for water was around 120 \u00b5s. Thus, the error93 in the RF flip-angle could be as high as 0.8%-1%. This means that in the CPMG sequence, around sin(180 0.01\u00d7180) = 3% of the initial magnetization might end up along the longitudinal axis after each 180-degree pulse. This would cause an accelerated decay of the transverse component Mxy. In addition, the magnetization stored along the longitudinal axis would eventually be knocked back into the transverse plane by an imperfect 180-degreepulse and contribute to the creation of stimulated echoes. Such echoes were observedoccasionally during our measurements. Figure 4.15 shows an example of an echo train thatproduced stimulated echoes in the second half of the train. We attribute this eect to miscalibrated 180-degree pulses. 01234567010002000300040005000600070008000 Time (s)Echo Magnitude (a.u.)

Number of echoes=256, TE=27.03 ms. 4.6.2 Heating of the Magnet and O-Resonance Eects One of the challenges in using resistive magnets for MR imaging is temporal instability of the magnetic eld due to the resistive heating of the copper wires. The heat causes the copperwires to expand outward from the center of the magnet bore-a process, which changes thestrength of the magnetic eld at the position of the sample. In addition, the increase in the temperature of the wires increases their resistance and, as a result, the power of the magnetic eld changes. The temporal instability of the B eld causes drifts in the readout frequency and therefore, phase errors. In Section 3.4.1 we showed that for a eld-of-view of 10 cm anda resolution of 1 mm, the temporal stability of the magnet should be better than 100 ppm.94 The temporal drifts in the readout eld are particularly damaging in the case of CPMG sequence, which has stringent phase stability requirements. In Section 4.3.1 we derived anexpression (Eq. 4.20) for the complex transverse magnetization in the rotating frame after the application of a 180-degree pulse, for the case of time-dependent local elds b j. In that derivation we made an assumption that stationary spins (unlike freely diusing spins) see aconstant, time-independent eld, which enabled us to solve the integral in Eq. 4.20. Thatassumption no longer holds when the local elds change due to temporal instabilities arisingfrom resistive heating of the magnet. In such a case, the two exponential terms in Eq. 4.20 no longer cancel out. The situation is conceptually similar to the case of diusing spins; the only dierence is in the source of the temporal eld variation. To solve the time integrals in Eq. 4.20, we need to make an assumption about the form of the b j() eld. To rst order, the eld drifts linearly with time, so that bj()=b+t, where bis the Larmor frequency of the individual spin, and =b/t. Equation see the same eld variation bj/tB/t , the sum over all spins reduces to M(t) = exp/bracketleftbigg i 4(B) tt2/bracketrightbigg M(0). (4.69) The above equation represents the complex magnetization at time tin terms of the initial magnetization (at t= 0). We see that unlike in the case of time-independent eld, the echo for a linearly drifting eld is phase shifted with respect to the original signal. As a result,the axis of rotation is no longer parallel to the magnetization-a situation which violates the CPMG condition (see beginning of Section 4.6). As the echo train progresses, transverse phase errors diverge. This leads to the growth of the longitudinal magnetization, a fasterdecay of transverse magnetization and, potentially, to stimulated echoes, as discussed inSection 4.6.1. Measurements of T CPMG 2 presented in Section 4.6 (see Figure 4.13) demonstrate that our resistive system can maintain sucient temporal stability to acquire as many as 4096 echoes95 in the time period of 30 s. This was an important milestone in investigating the use of resistive pulsed low-eld magnets for hyperpolarized gas imaging.96 4.7 Measurements of Diusion Using PGSE Sequence To determine the relaxation rate arising from the diusion of spins through magnetic eld gradients (1 /TDin Eq. 4.23), we need to know the value of diusion coecients for the gas mixture used in our experiments. Appendix A gives a theoretical estimation of theobservable diusion coecients of 129Xe and3He in the binary gas mixture with nitrogen gas, based upon Lennard-Jones potentials. For measurements of129Xe diusion, a cell containing 0.48 atm of naturally abundant129Xe and 0.14 atm of nitrogen was used. The theoretical calculation gave an observable diusion coecient for129Xe of (1 .08\u00b10.08)\u00d7105m2/s. For measurements of3He diusion, we used a cell that contained 0.75 atm of pure3He gas and 0.1 atm of nitrogen. The calculations yielded an observable diusion coecient for3He of (1.77\u00b10.12)\u00d7104m2/s. The diusion coecient used for measuring diusion coecients of hyperpolarized gases and water. First used; last n2loops: bipolar gradients with amplitude = g, width = , separation = . The pulse sequence used for measurements of the diusion coecients is shown in Fig- ure 4.16. A pair of bipolar pulsed gradients of size g, width , and separation , was added between each acquisition to the standard CPMG sequence (Figure 4.11). Since each180-degree pulse inverts the sign of the preceding gradients, the area under the gradientwaveform is zero at the time of each acquisition. The rst n 1echoes were acquired with the gradient amplitude set to zero, while the last n2echoes were acquired at a xed value of g.97 As a result, there was an extra decay due to diusion in the bipolar gradients during the lastn2echoes only. timeG' g G dT E d+G d+'d+'+G Figure 4.17: Bipolar gradient waveform used in the diusion sequence as a function of time.

The time integral of gfrom the beginning of the waveform to the occurrence of the spin echo at time t=TEis /integraldisplayt/prime 0g(t/prime)dt/prime/prime= 00 amplitude of the nth echo we need to sum n such integrals. Thus, A(nTE)=Aexp/bracketleftbigg of the sample, Ais the initial signal amplitude, and is the gyromagnetic ratio in radial units (i.e., rad/s/T). We are now able to express the echo amplitude as a function of the interecho time TE during the diusion echo amplitude of the rst n1echoes (at times n1TE), while Eq. 4.75 refers to the echo amplitude of the last n2echoes (at times ( n1+n2)TE). By taking the logarithm of each equation above, we obtain two straight lines. A least-square-t tothe two lines produces four parameters-slope and intersect of the rst line, P 1andP2,a n d slope and intersect of the second line, R1andR2, where P1=1 TE R2=Dn1b+l nA andb2g22(/3). The above equation can be rewritten in matrix form as A\u00b7x=B, where A= 010 10 0 01b . (4.76)99 Since there are four parameters (vector B), but only three unknowns (vector x), the system is over-constrained [85].13The problem is then to search for the least-square solution \u00af xthat minimizes the error E=(BA\u00afx). Geometrically, this translates to searching for a solution \u00afxsuch that the error vector Ewill be perpendicular to every column of A(or every AT). Therefore, AT(BA\u00afx)=0 \u00afx=/parenleftBig ATA/parenrightBig1ATb (4.77) D=\u00afx(3). (4.78) We have demonstrated tting the echo amplitudes obtained with the diusion sequence to two straight lines, we can obtain an estimation of the diusion constant usingEqs. 4.77 and 4.78. Figures 4.18, 4.19 show an example of diusion measurements for 3He,129Xe and water, respectively. Figures on the left display the echo magnitude as a function of acquisition time, while gures on the right show the average echo magnitude plotted on a logarithmic scale as a function of real time and best linear t to the data. From the logplots one can see a clear change in the slope of the two linear ts, which can be attributedto diusion losses in bipolar gradients during the last n 2echoes. The dierence in the slopes of the two straight ts depends on the parameter b(see Eq. 4.42). In the case of bipolar gradients of amplitude g, width , and separation , the is b42/integraldisplayt 0k2()d=n22g22/parenleftbigg 3/parenrightbigg .

We observed that a value of bwhich was smaller than the lower limit of the intervals given above produced large uncertainties in the measurements of diusion coecients forxenon and helium, and gave unreasonable results (i.e., negative Dvalues) for the diusion 13There will not exist a choice of x that perfectly ts the parameters of B.100 0 0.5 1 1.501000200030004000500060007000 Time (s)Echo Magnitude (a.u.) 0 0.5 1 1.56.577.588.59 Time (s)Log (Mean Echo Magnitude) Figure 4.18: Left:3He spin echo train obtained with diusion sequence from Figure 4.16.

The problem lies in the fact that a small value of b, combined with a small diusion coecient of water DH2O, produces a signal decay eDbwhich is smaller than the statistical variation of our measurements. Dividing the data into two parts and then tting each part to a straight line can result in a negative slope dierence and thus a negative diusion coecient. 4.7.1 Uncertainties in Determining Diusion Coecients of Hyperpolar- ized129Xeand3He Let us rst estimate the uncertainty in the theoretical estimation of diusion coecients for bipolar gas mixtures. Since the calculations involve many tabulated parameters, they are presented in Appendix A. From Eqs. A.2, A.4, and A.5 we see that the largest un- certainty in the estimation of observable diusion coecient of129Xe and3He comes from the uncertainty in the temperature of the gas inside the cell and, to a lesser extent, fromthe uncertainty in the pressures of the gases in the binary gas mixture. By performingsimple experiments in which we measured the temperature of 129Xe and3He cells during optical pumping and then again 2-5 min after cooling them in cold water, we were able to determine that the temperature of the129Xe cell was 30 \u00b110C, while the temperature of the3He cell (which was pumped at a higher temperature than129Xe) was 35 \u00b110C. The uncertainty in the pressure of gases inside the cell is directly related to the accuracy of thecell-lling process which we estimated to be \u00b10.01 atm. To estimate the uncertainty in the measurement of diusion coecient we return to Eqs. 4.76, 4.77, and 4.78. The diusion coecient b/parenleftbig1+n2 1TE2/parenrightbig{P(1)n1TE P (2)R(1) (4.80) Therefore, the uncertainty in Dwill mainly be a function of the uncertainties in b,TE, and uncertainties in the t parameters P(1),P(2),R(1),R(2). From Figures 4.18, 4.20 and 4.19 we can see that the ts match the data almost perfectly, so the uncertainties in the t parameters can be ignored. The uncertainty in the interecho time should also benegligible, because the console system can generates time intervals with 10 \u00b5s accuracy, while the smallest interecho times were 5 ms. The uncertainty from the TEtimes would102 thus be less than 0.5%. Finally, it is important to evaluate the uncertainty in the parameter b22(/3). The dominant error in bcomes from the gradient strength g=I, where is the gradient eciency coecient in units of mT/m/A, and Iis the current through the gradient coils in units of Amperes. The gradient eciencies were calibrated for each gradient coil with 5%accuracy. Since the gradient eciency is the dominant source of uncertainty, we concludethat the measurements of 129Xe,3He and water diusion coecients are D/D=2 g/g= 10% accurate. This estimation is also consistent with the spread of Dvalues obtained from repeated measurements.

We are now going to investigate this dependence in more detail. TheTCPMG 2 measurements showed that using longer interecho times in the CPMG sequence resulted in shorter measured TCPMG 2 relaxation times. This dependence is in- dicative of diusion-induced losses (see Section 4.4.1) which occur when spins diuse outof the voxel that is being inverted and refocused by the 180-degree pulse of the CPMG sequence. The longer the time between two successive 180-degree pulses (which equals the interecho time TEin Figure 4.11), the bigger the average distance travelled by the spins during that time and the bigger the loss of signal coherence. However, diusion loss is theresult of random phase accretion when spins diuse through magnetic eld gradients, andthere were no external gradients used in the CPMG pulse sequence of Figure 4.11. Does this mean the reasoning just presented is flawed? Not really. Even though there were no external gradients applied during the CPMG sequence of Figure 4.11, there were gradientspresent due to magnetic eld inhomogeneity as well as gradients due to the magnetic eldsusceptibility dierences between air and the sample. 14These gradients, which are constant throughout the CPMG sequence, are estimated to be small (on the order of 0 .1m T / m ) , yet can cause a detectable signal loss because of the large diusion constant of gases. To compute signal decay due to constant gradients we refer back to Figure 4.17 and Eq. 4.73. The amplitude of the nth echo in the case of constant gradients is the limiting case of Eq. 4.73, with TE/2a n d .A tt i glass cells, the susceptibility eects are negligible.104 By adding the decay due to the inherent T2 relaxation, we get A(nTE)=Aexp/parenleftbigg nTE T2/parenrightbigg exp/parenleftbigg 1 12Dn2g2TE3/parenrightbigg . (4.82) Since the detected relaxation rate is 1 /TCPMG 2 , the two exponentials can be combined into a single decay term, A(nTE)= Aexp/parenleftBigg nTE TCPMG 2/parenrightBigg ,where 1 TCPMG 21 T2+1 12D2g2TE2. (4.83) The above equation expresses the relationship between the TCPMG 2 relaxation time and the interecho time TE. We see that the inherent T2relaxation is equal to TCPMG 2 relaxation atTE=0 . We performed TCPMG 2 measurements using the pulse sequence shown in Figure 4.11 and with TEtimes ranging from 5 ms to above 100 ms for129Xe,3He and water. We then plotted TCPMG 2 versus TEand tted the data using least-square method to a two-parameter of the form F(TE)=1 1/a+bTE2. (4.84) Using Eq. 4.83, the values of aandbgive the inherent T2relaxation and the gradient amplitude due respectively: 12b and the gradient amplitude gare independent of each other, we should obtain, within the experimental error, same T2relaxation times regardless of the size of the background gradients. We therefore repeated the TCPMG 2 (TE) measurements for a range of gvalues (0.01 mT/m-0.4 mT/m) which were controlled with the size of the shimming currents applied to the magnetic eld gradients (see beginning of Section 4.5).The measurements of T CPMG 2 for dierent gvalues should, in theory, converge to a single point at TE=0 .105 Figures 4.21, 4.22, and 4.23 show the results of our TCPMG 2 (TE) measurements for3He, 129Xe, and water, respectively. Water measurements were done on distilled water as well as water doped with 0.012 molar CuSO 4\u00b75H2O-a substance which decreases the T2relaxation time of water. Only the results for the distilled water are shown. The water measurements should show no variation in the measured TCPMG 2 beyond the statistical error because of the small diusion constant of water (see Section 4.7). This is conrmed in Figure 4.23.The average T 2relaxation time of distilled water was 1 s, while T2of doped water was around 42 ms. Both results are in agreement with expectations. Analysis of the three sets of129XeTCPMG 2 data in Figure 4.22 results in an inherent T2 relaxation of129Xe equal to 46 .7\u00b10.5 s. On the other hand, the inherent T2relaxation time of3He for the two sets of data in Figure 4.21 is equal to 19 .2\u00b14.5 s. In the next section we examine the sources of errors involved in obtaining this data. 4.8.1 Uncertainties in Determining Inherent T2 Relaxation of Hyperpo- larized129Xeand3He Equation 4.84 tells us that the inherent T2relaxation of129Xe and3He is obtained from one of the parameters of a two-parameter t. The quality of the t will thus determinethe uncertainty in the inherent T 2time. In addition, we need to examine the uncertainty associated with the data of Figures 4.21 and 4.22. Each data point in these plots wasobtained from the least-square t of the CPMG echo train (see Figure 4.13). Consequently, the uncertainty in the extracted T CMPG 2 time constant will contribute to the uncertainty in the data points of Figures 4.21 and 4.22. By shifting the data in the vicinity of TE=0 for the amount of TCPMG 2 uncertainty we concluded that the uncertainty in the estimation of the inherent T2is between 3% and 6%. The uncertainty of 6% is sucient to explain the variation in the extrapolated T2times for the three sets of129Xe data, but it does not suce to explain the 20% error in the3He data. We thus have to look at possible systematic errors. There are many eects which can shorten the measured TCPMG 2 times. We mentioned some of them, such as the uncertainties in the calibration of the 180-degree pulses and theo-resonance eect due to the resistive heating of the magnet, in Sections 4.6.1 and 4.6.2. However, none of these possible sources of error should aect 3He data more than129Xe. One major dierence between3He and129Xe was the temperature of the cell106 00.010.020.030.040.050.060510152025 TE (s)T2CPMG (s) Figure 4.21:3HeTCPMG 2 data as a function of interecho time, TE, for two shimming values, and a t to the data (s)T2CPMG (s) Figure 4.22:129XeTCPMG 2 data as a function of interecho time, TE, for three shimming values, and a t to the data according (s) Figure 4.23: Distilled water TCPMG 2 data as a function of interecho time, TE, and a t to the data according to Eq 4.84. g=0.005 mT/m, vs. 80Cf o r129Xe). Since the signals were collected immediately after placing the cell into the low-eld scanner for best SNR values, the3He cell might not have been in thermal equilibrium during data acquisition and the gas inside the cell might have been undergoing convective flow. To understand how flow of gas inside the cell would decrease the echo magnitude and contribute to TCPMG 2 decay, we return to Eq. 4.40. The second term on the right hand side represents the phase shift of the echo in the presence of flow with velocity v.S i n c en o external gradients were applied during the CPMG sequence, the gradient g(t) in Eq. 4.40 will be due to the magnetic eld inhomogeneities.

For a 1-degree phase shift have exp/bracketleftbigg 1 4vgTE2/bracketrightbigg = exp/bracketleftbigg i 180/bracketrightbigg v=1 c m /s. (4.89) The result tells us that if the convective flow moves with velocity of 1 cm/s (a plausible assumption), each spin echo would be phase-shifted 1-degree from the previous one. Thiswould violate the CPMG condition which requires that the axis of rotation remains parallelto the gas magnetization (see also Section 4.6.2) and result in an accelerated decay of spin echoes and a shorter T CPMG 2 time. We tested our \"flow\" hypothesis by performing some simple tests. Table 4.3 gives an overview of these tests and the corresponding qualitative results. On the basis of the testresults we were able to form the following conclusions: 1. Shaking the cell and so disturbing 15The error in TCPMG 2 of the echo train with the shortest TEtime will weight the most in the evaluation of the error in T2.108 the gas inside the cell does indeed aect the quality of spin echoes and the rate of decay of the spin echo train; 2. In our in vitro experiments the eect of gas movement (due to shaking or high temperatures) subsides after 10-20 s, hence data acquisition should not begin before the gas had the time to reach thermal equilibrium; 3. Spin echoes decay faster if the cell is not at room temperature during data acquisition, although more studies (possibly with 3He gas rather than129Xe) would have to be done to understand whether this eect is due to hyperpolarized gas relaxation resulting from collisions with unpolarized Rb vapor or dueto the eects of gas flow. In summary, we think that either shaking of the cell and/or not cooling the gas inside the cell to room temperature aected our T CPMG 2 data and thus contributed to the error in the inherent3HeT2relaxation times. Evaluating the size of this systematic error would require a more detailed study. Alternatively, we could increase the statistics of3He data. Finally, understanding the eects of flow on a CPMG spin echo train and the measured TCPMG 2 relaxation time would be essential in in vivo experiments, due to the motion (flow) of gas through the bronchi and lungs.

In particular, the eld instability at 397 kHz (i.e., 33 mT for129Xe) is small enough to allow the implementation of the CPMG spin echo sequence. We were able to collect129Xe CPMG spin echo trains lasting over 30 s and following a well behaved exponential decay. In addition, by adding a small oset eldto the readout magnet, we guaranteed an adiabatic transition in magnetization alignment during the pulsing of the readout magnet and hence prevented loss of gas polarization. We have developed a single-shot sequence for measuring diusion coecients of gases which separates diusion losses from T CPMG 2 relaxation losses. Our diusion sequence was a variation of the pulsed gradient spin echo sequence, with external gradients appliedin the second half of the sequence only. For the binary mixture of hyperpolarized gas and nitrogen, the experimental values of 3He,129Xe (2.10\u00b10.21)\u00d7109m2/s. The dominant experimental error was due to the uncertainty in the gradient strengths. This error could easily be reduced in the future by calibrating thegradient strengths more accurately. Finally, the experimental measurements agree well with the theoretical calculations of diusion coecients using Lennard-Jones [30] potentials. Because diusion coecient is dependent on the cell pressure and gas composition, it is dicult to compare our data with the existing experimental data on diusion coecients.Schmidth et al. [80] measured a 3He diusion coecient of 21 .3\u00b10.4m m2/s at 7 atm of gas, which translates to (1 .491\u00b10.028)\u00d7104m2/s at 1 atm of gas and agrees well with our measurement to within the uncertainty in the nitrogen pressure used in their experiment. Peled et al. [82] measured a129Xe diusion coecient of 0 which close to our calculated129Xe self-diusion coecient (see Appendix A), so we conclude that their gas mixture had negligible amounts of nitrogen gas. Finally, by varying the interecho time in the CPMG sequence we were able to determine theT2relaxation time at zero interecho spacing, which represents the inherent T2decay of hyperpolarized gas and is the upper limit on the time available for spin echo imaging. Wemeasured an inherent 129XeT2relaxation of 46 .7\u00b10.5 s, and an inherent3HeT2relaxation of 19.2\u00b14.5 s. We hypothesize that the large error in the3He data might be due to the flow110 (motion) of gas inside the cell, which would result if the cell is not in thermal equilibrium during data acquisition or is shaken before being placed in the scanner. Most of the T2values quoted in literature are the TCPMG 2 times which include diusion losses in the background gradients. For instance, Pfeer et al. [86] point out that their T2 measurement was influenced by the eld inhomogeneities so that the129Xe relaxation time of 12.9\u00b11.9 s was the lower limit on129XeT2relaxation. Darrasse et al. [47] measured TCPMG 2 for3He in lungs at two dierent interecho times (10 ms, 30 ms) but did not use their measurements to nd the inherent T2in lungs. For future work, it would be interesting to see whether our method for determining the inherent T2times would be applicable to in vivo experiments. When imaging lungs, the eect of gas flow on the T2measurements would need to be studied in detail. However, such a study requires a full body scanner. "}
