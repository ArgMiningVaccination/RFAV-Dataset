Jan. 7 - 9, 1997 Highlights Even if there were no surprises at the open- ing of the 80th Legislative Session of theMinnesota House of Representatives, the vi-suals were top-notch. It's only natural tojuxtapose the scene with the way it looked ahundred years ago, which allows the observerto come face-to-face with tradition. All legis-lators promised to uphold the United Statesand Minnesota constitutions and to faith-fully discharge the duties of their offices.Their families and friends looked on proudly\u2014 for the most part. Various toddlers whorefused to acknowledge the solemnity of theoccasion had to be escorted off the floor. As expected, Rep. Phil Carruthers, (DFL- Brooklyn Center) was elected Speaker of theHouse 70-64 party-line vote. MinorityLeader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) 64 Republican votes. In nominating speeches, supporters praised Carruthers' desire to put the interests of thepeople of Minnesota above partisan politics;his willingness to learn about districts out-side his own; the energy he brings to theoffice; his history as a friend to education andto rural Minnesota; his desire to reach out todiverse groups; his abilities to compro-1997-98 Legislature . . Gavel sounds on opening of 80th Legislative Session mise and to listen. Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth) lauded the new speaker's record asmajority leader, a position Carruthers heldfor the past three sessions, and for under-standing the \"importance of uniting forces,forgetting differences, and working for thebenefit of all people of Minnesota.\" During his acceptance speech, Carruthers acknowledged the new and returning mem-bers of the House, his family, and the \"out-standing service\" to the people of Minnesotaby his predecessor, Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls). He said he hoped to continue theexcellent relationship he shares with Minor-ity Leader Sviggum. Carruthers noted thatboth political parties are strongly representedin Minnesota government, which indicatesthey \"both deserve to serve the state of Min-nesota.\" While Minnesota can feel proud of its record as a national leader in terms of itseconomy, standard of living, and educationalsystem, the Legislature has to change its re-cent course in order to continue that tradi-tion, Carruthers said. \"During the last ses-sion, we got so wrapped up in partisan fight-ing, we forgot why the citizens sent us here,\" Rep. Tim Pawlenty holds his 6-month-old daughter,Mara, as he scans some paperwork prior to thesounding of the gavel on the first day of the 1997Legislative Session. Rep.

First-termer Rep. Joe Mullery, right, is Leighton's seatmate.he said. \"The people of Minnesota expect us to use good judgment. We must rememberthe voters' message regarding divided gov-ernment. They want us to work together,Democrats and Republicans.\" While the opening ceremony may have seemed standard to some participants, itseemed very new to Marjoleim DeConinck,an 18-year-old exchange student from Bel-gium who came as a guest of Rep. Ann Rest(DFL-New Hope). \"It's so interesting to seehow it all works. It's very different from myexpectations. I've never been so involved withpolitics in my life,\" she said, adding that shesuspects the process she witnessed in theMinnesota House of Representatives is verydifferent from that in Belgium, with its par-liament and monarchy. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), now en- tering her 13th term, also noted somethingnew. \"When I started in 1972, there were sixwomen \u2014 total \u2014 in both Houses. Todaywomen make up about a third of the House4 SESSION WEEKLY / January 10, 1997 Rep. Ann Rest carried her restless grandson, Jakob Asplund, from the House chamber after being sworn into office.members. You can clearly see the tenor has changed. That's a big difference.\" One floor below, in the Capitol Rotunda, about 100 people protested against anticipated cuts in welfare benefits, given the recent passage of federal legislation.Members of the Minnesota Welfare Rights Coalition held signs that read:\"Workfare isn't fair\" and \"No welfare cuts.\" Just outside the House chamberdoor, Jeff Hilgert held a sign that read: \"Cut welfare for the rich, not the poor.\"\"Do I really have to tell you all the ways the government subsidizes rich people?\"he asked, naming tax breaks to corporations and wealthy individuals as examples.He added that several legislators shook his hand, but \"they're all pretty busytoday.\" Before the gavel sounded and the newly elected Minnesota House of Represen- tatives began the day's business, a moment of silence was observed for formerRep. Jim Rice (DFL-Mpls), a tireless proponent of labor and the arts who served13 terms in the House. Rice died of natural causes on his 71st birthday lastOctober following a party held in his honor at the Capitol. \u2014 Celeste Riley Elizabeth and Adam Giorgi, the niece and nephew of Rep.

The 43- year-old representative from Brooklyn Cen-ter has been called mild-mannered, deliber-ate, a policy wonk, and a detail man. So whatexplains his steady rise into the leadership ofthe Minnesota House of Representatives? \"I like to try to build a consensus,\" Carruthers said. Consensus-building may not be flashy, but it has made the new speaker a lot of friends onboth sides of the aisle. \"I have the highest respect for Phil both as a legislator and as a person,\" said Rep. CharlieWeaver (R-Anoka). \"He is a worthy ally andopponent. The best part about him is thatyou can engage him in battle and still go out. . . afterward.\" Carruthers has promised to bring a new openness and spirit of cooperation to thespeaker's post. \"I want to increase participa-Speaker of the House . . . 'Mild-mannered' Carruthers strives for consensus committees to recommend assignments. Thismade the selection process more open andless personal than before. And in an unusualshow of bipartisanship, the new speaker hon-ored all of the Republican minority's com-mittee requests. Official publications noweven list a \"lead Republican\" for each com-mittee. \"The overall level of cooperation is the best since I've been here,\" said Weaver. But thatdoesn't mean that Republicans regardCarruthers as a pushover, Weaver said. \"We,as a caucus, do not take him lightly. He iseven-tempered but not a wimp. He will beevery bit as tough as [former Speaker] IrvAnderson, but with a different style.\" Carruthers said he also wants to improve the Legislature's communication and out-reach to the general public. \"That means a lotof press contact and being open and acces-sible,\" he said. \"It also means appearing onvarious public affairs broadcasts \u2014 cableAnthony Village. Alex Carruthers first worked for Minneapolis-based Honeywell and laterjoined the University of Minnesota faculty.Marie Carruthers, Phil's mother, worked at apublic library. The couple is now retired andlives in the Highland Park area of St. Paul. Since receiving his law degree from the University of Minnesota, Carruthers enjoyeda successful career as an attorney, serving as aprosecutor for several western metro sub-urbs. He is divorced and has two children,Rory, 5 and Alex, 7. To escape the rigors of Minnesota politics Carruthers turns to nature. \"I enjoy all sortsof outdoor activities,\" he said. \"Fishing, birdwatching, camping, and playing sports withmy sons.\" Carruthers was first elected to the Legisla- ture in 1986, participating in that year's DFLtakeover of the House. In 1993, he becameDFL majority leader. In his 10 years in the Legislature, Carruthers has championed good-government reformsand people-protecting new laws. He saidroughly 70 of his bills and amendments havebecome law. Measures he has pushed forinclude: Tougher sanctions against drunkendriving, improvements to Minnesota's openmeeting law, better protection for foster chil-dren, and consumer protection from fly-by-night roofing contractors. The speaker plans to push for reform on a number of other issues this session including: Property Taxes: \"We have an opportunity, given the budget surplus, to use transitiondollars to phase in some changes to makeproperty taxes more equitable.\" Welfare: Carruthers supports Governor Arne Carlson's proposal for a bipartisan taskforce to respond to the challenges posed byrecent federal welfare reform legislation. Education: \"We need to provide more ac- countability in public education and re-store the funding that has been cut.\" Higher Education: \". . . An area that has been slighted in the budget process and that isvital to the strength of our state.\"Another issue Carruthers anticipates com- ing forward, but clearly doesn't relish, is aproposed new stadium for the MinnesotaTwins. \"I'm sure that the stadium will comeup, but I think it is important that it notdominate the session,\" he said. \u2014 Steve Comptontion by House members and get more mem-bers involved in decisions,\" he said. The speaker offered a preview of this new style of leadership in the way he made com-mittee appointments for the session. Pastspeakers often doled out committee assign-ments behind closed doors as political favorsor punishments. In contrast, Carruthers ap-pointed a 12-member DFL committee ontelevision, radio, and Almanac (a weekly pub- lic television news magazine program).\" The new speaker remembers listening to President John F. Kennedy's inaugural ad-dress when he was 7 years old and living withhis parents in Canada. \"Kennedy's call topublic service inspired me,\" he said.

The Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party(DFL) retained its majority and gained asingle seat, leaving Republicans on the shortend of a 70-64 partisan split. Nearly 95 per-cent of incumbents were re-elected. Republicans usurped four vacant seats in far western Minnesota previously held byDFLers, but lost four incumbents in subur-ban districts north of the Twin Cities. A fifthincumbent Republican was ousted in District15A, adding one to the DFL caucus strength. But the overall numbers don't reflect the increased diversity of the House.

Latest election brings greater diversity to the House occupation among lawmakers. Businessranked second, with 21 lawmakers. In 1995,both occupations tied for first with 20 mem-bers each. Of the 22 members who listededucator as their primary occupation, 15 areDFLers and seven are Republicans. Of the 21members who listed business as their pri-mary occupation, 16 are Republicans andfive are DFLers. The number of farmers in the House con- tinues to decline. For the third straight bien-nium, the House will convene with a new lowfor the number of farmers. Members listing farming as their primary occupation slipped to 11 \u2014 down from 14 in1995. That makes farming the fifth mostcommon occupation in the House, where italso ranked two years ago. A decade ago theHouse convened with 27 farmers. This downward trend seems to mirror ag- ricultural statistics compiled by the U.S. Cen-sus Bureau which show that the number offarms nationwide are at its lowest point sincebefore the Civil War and still declining.As in previous years, the top five \u2014 educa- tor, business, legislator, attorney, and farmer\u2014 remain quite a distance from sixth place,now held by consultants (6). Lawmakers truly do come from all walks of life. Free-lance artist, accountant, physician,motivational speaker, and custom pictureframer are among other diverse occupationslisted. The educational level of members contin- ues its upward trend, with 74 percent of allHouse members holding at least a four-yearcollege degree. That's up from 67 percent in1995. A total of 43 members hold a graduate degree, up from 37 in 1995, and 32 in 1993.Those with some graduate work rose to 16,up from 14 in 1995. Currently, the largest class of lawmakers is composed of the 29 beginning their secondterm; 21 of the second-termers are Republi-cans and eight are DFLers. The next largestclass is composed of the 25 members in theirthird term; 17 are Republicans and eight areDFLers. Ranking third in size are those members entering their first term with 22 members.Twelve of the 22 are DFLers and 10 are Re-publicans. Over 70 percent of House members (72.3) have served less than 10 years in the House.Of those, Republicans outnumber DFLers bya 3-2 margin. Of the 37 members who have served more than 10 years, 32 of them are DFLers; five areRepublicans. To date, no current Republicanmember has served more than 18 years in theHouse. Ten DFLers have served at least 20years. At 48.3, the average age of House members continues to rise. Since 1975, when the aver-age stood at 40.8 years, the age has steadilyincreased to its present level. In 1995, theaverage age was 47.9 years; in 1991, 47.1. In 1975, half the House members were no older than 38. Today, 102 members are over40. Currently, the youngest House member is22, and the oldest is 85. \u2014 John Tschidanationwide).

Minnesota's newest lawmakers were backin the classroom lastmonth for a two-dayintroduction to life Dec. 11-13,1996, at RiverwoodConference Centernear Monticello,Minn. The purpose of the conference was tohelp 22 newly electedlawmakers (and tworeturning members)make a smooth transition to the role of beinga state legislator. The program included guestspeakers, panel discussions, legislative work-shops, and staff presentations. Guest speakers included Dr. Robert Terry, head of the Terry Group and former profes-sor of ethics and public policy at the Univer-sity of Minnesota's Hubert H. HumphreyInstitute of Public Affairs. While not directly quoting Sophocles, who said \"Nobody has a more sacred obligationto obey the law than those who make thelaw,\" Terry's message was clear: \"The integ-rity of the office is so strong that if you messup, everybody loses,\" he said. Public leaders,Orientation retreat . . . New legislators meet on ethics, lawmaking process he added, should be honest, forward-look-ing, and inspiring. Such characteristics, orlack thereof, affect the ever-changing ba-rometer of the public's trust in government.Citizens, Terry said, also demand respect.They want to be heard and taken seriously.Other leadership traits of top concern, re-vealed by a survey of 17,000 people, includedoptimism and trust. Wrap all those ethicalstandards into one package, and you havethe basis for sound public policy. \"These are values that need to be in place for making and keeping decisions over time,\"Terry said. Other speakers included John Brandl, pro-fessor of legisla-tive experience \u2014eight as a Minne-sota House and four as astate senator. Heencouraged law-makers to remem-ber they represent all of Minnesota, and not just the parochialinterests of an individual legislative district.

The freshman who represents District 21Aisn't complaining \u2014those venues are amongthe best ways to meet voters in southwestern Minnesota. Seifert, a 24-year-old high school social studies teacher, said he'll reserve complaintsfor the Legislature \u2014 particularly on issuessuch as the state's handling of schools. Unlike a majority of House lawmakers who are educators (15 of 22 are DFLers),Seifert ran as a Republican and considershimself the voice of many rank-and-file teach-ers who choose not to get involved in thelegislative process or a teachers' union. Theyspend their time working hard to reach theirstudents and want St. Paul to relinquish somecontrol over their classrooms, he said. \"Bureaucratic and messy,\" are the words he chooses to describe the state's new gradu-ation standards for high school students. Thestandards call for passing basic skills tests inmath, reading, and writing before a diplomais issued. They also call for success in what iscalled the \"Profile of Learning,\" a broad analy-sis of each student's overall performance in avariety of other such as geographyand science.New members . . . Seifert brings humility, common sense to Capitol The standards only serve to give state offi- cials a \"reason to run around the state and saythey're doing good,\" Seifert said, adding thatdecision makers in St. Paul need to stopshoving mandates at local schools. Although not the youngest member of the Minnesota Legislature, Seifert did hear com-ments about his age on the campaign trail.Some asked how a 24-year-old who hasn'thad time to learn about life could be en-trusted to know anything about running thestate. But Seifert, who replaces retiring eight- year veteran Jim Girard, had a ready response.Sure, other people may have \"lots of bigdegrees, lots of important jobs, but thatdoesn't stand up to an ounce of commonsense.\" He said he plans to remain teaching at Marshall Senior High School when he is notin session at the Legislature. Although herefused to discuss his candidacy with his stu-dents during the campaign (to avoid anyappearance of impropriety) and even im-posed a \"gag rule\" in his classroom, he knowshe had an impact. \"Some kids who had never even picked up a newspaper were read-ing and paying more attention to news andcurrent events,\" he said. Seifert's students are still a little amazed that one of their teachers is a lawmaker. Hesaid his successful campaign taught studentsa valuable lesson: \"Hard work and integritymatter.\" He learned that lesson from his parents, Norbert and Rita. \"If everyone lived their 1996 population: 33,377 Largest city: Marshall Minnesota Top concern: \"Getting our money's worth out of state government.

Marty Seifert NOTESlives the way my parents do, we wouldn't have the problems we do.\" His parents, he said, don't believe in toot- ing their own horn but in getting involved inthe community, whether that means mow-ing the church lawn or sewing clothes for theneedy. Seifert himself grew up on a farm. \"I was born into a family that . . . would [make people] think I should be a hillbilly,\"he said. One of six boys, his mother is aformer school teacher; his father, a hog andgrain farmer. Seifert grew up reading discarded encyclo- pedias and almanacs from garage sales andlater collected antique farm machinery andseed corn bags. When his time in the Legislature is said and done, Seifert said he wants to be rememberedas a promoter of southwestern Minnesotawho stood up for the district rather than\"feathering his own nest.\" \"I have to practice what I preach to my kids,\" he said. \u2014 K.

Still,If legislators succeed in reforming Minnesota's complex property tax code, Rep.Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) could well besporting a new look by the end of the session.At the Taxes Committee's initial meetingJan. 9, representatives got a crash course onMinnesota's taxation system and heard Dawkins, with his flowing locks tied backinto a neat ponytail, reiterate his pledge to lethis hair grow until the property tax is nolonger the state's number one source of rev-enue. \"I think we can accomplish that this ses- sion,\" Dawkins said, grinning. \"But will you lose your strength if we do?\" Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls), who chairs thecommittee, asked. \"I hope not,\" Dawkins answered.Sviggum drew chuckles by pointing out that in 1941 Joe DiMaggio had not completed hisrecord hitting streak, and Rep. WillardMunger (DFL-Duluth), the House's elderstatesman, hadn't begun the first of his 21non-consecutive terms in the House.12 SESSION WEEKLY / January 10, 1997 The Capitol building isn't as big as it once was, at least in the eyes of one lawmaker. Andlegislators don't seem so \"super human\" any- more. It's not that newly elected Rep. TorreyWestrom has growncynical. He's grown up. When he first visited the State Capitol as ayoung teen, Westrom satin the gallery high abovethe House floor and watched the players below. \"I thought maybe I could be one of those pages on the floor but never a lawmaker,\" hesaid. \"They seemed intangible.\" The 23-year-old Republican from Elbow Lake, Minn., was mistaken. Today he repre-sents District 13A in west central Minnesota,a seat formerly held for 12 years by DFL Rep.Chuck Brown of Appleton, Minn. Much has been said and written about Westrom because he is believed to be the firstblind House member in state history. \"I am a representative. Blindness is an incidental,\" he said. Westrom, blinded at 14 by a car accident on his parents' dairy farm, understands thathe is expected to be a role model for peoplewith blindness. But he hopes people see himas a lawmaker first. \"Everybody is a roleNew members . . . Westrom wants of dollars model . . . . It goes with all legislators.\" Unknown to Westrom until recently, a role model helped pave the newcomer's wayinto politics. Minnesota was home to Tho-mas Schall, a blind U.S. House and Senatemember from 1915 to 1935. Schall, a lawyer, came from western Min- nesota. With the help of his wife, who read tohim regularly, and with the use of a guidedog, Schall was able to keep up his law prac-tice, which eventually led to a lengthy politi-cal life. He helped pass legislation allowingguide dogs on public transportation and inpublic places. Westrom, a graduate in political science from Bemidji State University, won't be us-ing a dog during the legislative session. Al-ready, he has been studying the hallways,stairwells, and nooks and crannies of theState Office Building and the Capitol. Duringsession, he will have his own legislative assis-tant to help read written materials to him. But the issues on Westrom's mind don't necessarily focus on blindness. Instead, hewants to save taxpayer dollars and create jobs in rural Minnesota. He is concerned about cuts to the base funding of local schools and wants to attractjobs to rural Minnesota that involve the pri-vate sector \u2014 not a state jobs program. Westrom also is concerned about prison reform. In his district sits Appleton, home to 1996 Population: 32,755 Largest city: Morris Counties: Big Stone, Douglas, Grant, Pope, Stevens, Swift, TraverseLocation: west central Minnesota Top concern: \"Declining population. It spills over to fewer kids in the schools, fewer families spend-ing money in main street businesses. It's a spiral-ing downturn effect and calls for the need foreconomic development in the area and good pay-ing jobs.\" \u2014 Rep. Torrey Westromthe state's only privately run prison. It costs that prison about half of what it costs the stateto incarcerate an inmate. Unlike some lawmakers, no particular is- sue drew Westrom into the race for a Houseseat. \"So many areas seemed ridiculous,\" hesaid, such as \"Why is the government eventalking about building a stadium . . . and Whyrequire truckers to keep log books when noone can verify them anyway?\" Westrom's love for political debate and dialogue prompted him to run. The trick togood lawmaking, he said, is \"to put District 13ARep. Torrey Westrom Congress has granted President Clinton a new power, but it's one Minnesota gov-ernors have enjoyed for more than acentury. Republicans in the 104th Congress kept a 1994 campaign promise to pass the line-item veto, and the president signed themeasure into law last year. Minnesota is one of 43 states where governors have line-item veto authority.In most states, including this one, thatauthority is limited to spending bills. An amendment to the state constitu- tion granted Minnesota governors line-item veto authority in 1876. Voters at thepolls for a presidential election that yearratified the amendment by a margin of roughly 10-to-1. John S. Pillsbury,Minnesota's eighth governor, was thefirst to have use of the line-item veto. At the same time Minnesotans were embracing the line-item veto, a pro-posal to give the president similar au-thority was sputtering. President Ulysses S. Grant in 1876 offered the first proposal to give thepresident line-item veto power. Grant'sproposal failed, and, since then, morethan 200 bills and proposed constitu-tional amendments with similar goals met with defeat in Congress. But a new federal law effective Jan. 1, 1997, provides the president line-itemveto authority with respect to appro-priations and limited tax benefits. Proponents of the line-item veto long have argued that it reduces wastefulspending, mainly the so-called \"porkbarrel\" projects considered to be devicesfor lawmakers to bolster support in theirhome districts. Opponents claim the line-item veto threatens the balance of power by shift-ing authority away from the legislativebranch to the executive branch.

While none rose to stir the crowds with a bit offiery partisan oratory, the fair is a traditional hotbed of political activity.Politicians, in fact, were instrumental infounding the Great Minnesota Get Together. Today's state fair stresses food, farms, and family entertainment, but in the territorialdays the fair existed for a higher purpose: toattract more immigrants to the Minnesotaarea. Territorial Governor Willis Gorman, in an 1855 message to the Legislature, noted thathe had \"received almost innumerable letters. . .desiring to know if our winters were notvery long, and so exceedingly cold that stockfreezes to death, and man hardly dare ventureout of his domicile.\" The region's reputationfor hostile temperatures had spread far andwide and it was scaring away the settlers. At the time, the territory's population was thin, with many residents feeling the pull ofthe warm California coast. In such an envi-ronment, financiers and politicians werelooking to boost the number of Minneso-tans. They sought to do so by shattering thestereotype of the \"frozen tundra\" and pro-moting the area's fertile soil for prospectivefarmers. Aiding in this marketing venture were budding agricultural societies, many of whichwere formed at the county level. Gormanhimself served as president of the MinnesotaTerritorial Agricultural Society, founded in1854. Its goal? \"Agriculture societies, along with agricul- tural fairs displaying grain and produce raisedon native soil, were blatant advertisementsfor the natural resources of the Northwest,\"wrote Karal Ann Marling in Blue Ribbon, A Social and Pictorial History of the MinnesotaState Fair . And so the fair was born, small at first, and not on its current site in Falcon Heights, butthe beginning of a healthy Minnesota tradi-tion nonetheless. The first fair The Minnesota State Agricultural Society says the first territorial fair was held in Min-neapolis in October 1855, and with it came aGreat Minnesota Get Together . . . Politics ever present at the Minnesota State Fair fascination with mutant fruits and vegetablesthat still endures. On display for wide-eyedfairgoers were a 17-foot-high cornstalk, a 28-pound cabbage, and an 18-pound radish.Each such monstrosity seemed to prove thatquality cultivation was possible west of theGreat Lakes, despite the challenging winters. Also on hand were hogs, bulls, sheep, horses, and poultry competing for top hon-ors in their respective categories. A crowd of2,500 watched a female equestrian contest, inwhich riders were judged not only on skill,but on poise and dress as well. There wereneedlework competitions, homemade car-pets, and even a display of cheese. The ances-tors of today's blue ribbon competitions werewell under way. Early fairs were held in subsequent years in St. Paul, Minneapolis, and even at FortSnelling. The fair then traveled to Red Wing,Winona, Rochester, and even Owatonna overthe next few decades while a behind-the-scenes war raged between Minneapolis andSt. Paul. Each of the Twin Cities wanted tostand as the home of the state fair. St. Paulinterests wanted it somewhere in the Midwayarea. Minneapolis wanted it stationed in whatis now Minnehaha Park. Leading the chargefor the Minneapolitans was William S. King, As part of the House's 23rd year at the Minnesota State Fair, computer, publications, and a video helpededucate the public about the House of Representatives.$100,000 for new buildings and cementedthe site that the State Fair still calls hometoday. Political roots From the beginning, politicians and their oratory played a key role at the fair. Promi-nent figures such as Henry Sibley andAlexander Ramsey, the state's first two gov-ernors, respectively, were instrumental inmaking the fair a reality, and found them-selves addressing large crowds at the fledglingannual events. Other state and local officeholders deliv- ered speeches in the fair's first years, but itwasn't long before those of national promi-nence were imported. Once statehood wasachieved in 1858, Minnesota's role in na-tional politics increased. In 1860, the yearAbraham Lincoln carried the vote in Minne-sota by a 2-to-1 margin, the Republicanstapped Congressman Cassius Clay fromKentucky. He rambled for two hours in aspeech criticized for being \"highfalutin . pub- lisher of the New York Tribune (and later Democratic presidential candidate), camewest in 1865 to address the fair crowd. His a cattleman and one-time Congressman, who established his own local version of the fairduring many of the years it was held awayfrom his hometown. Ultimately, the site of the Ramsey County Poor Farm was offered as a gift to the stateAgriculture Society and a deal was struck.The Legislature was happy to see the geo-graphic feud end, and in 1885 markedtwo major speeches were well-attended and warmly received, and focused on farmingand agriculture. But it was in 1878 that the Minnesota State Fair landed a top political prize: the first visitby the President of the United States,Rutherford B. Hayes. 1926 photograph by Paul Hamilton Courtesy Minnesota Historical Society17 January 10, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY And so began a series of presidents that would grace the state fair, continuing withGrover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, andTeddy Roosevelt. Not only sitting presidentsbut presidential hopefuls visited as well, in-cluding three-time loser William JenningsBryan, who made the same number of visitsto the fair around the turn of the century. \"No other fair has been as popular as the Minnesota Fair as a stopping place in presi-dential campaigns,\" wrote Ray Spear andHarry Frost in Minnesota State Fair: The His- tory and Heritage of 100 Years . Roosevelt was actually the vice-president (with presidential aspirations) when he madethe first of several visits to the fair in 1901.Here, on opening day, he delivered his fa-mous line, \"Speak softly, and carry a bigstick\" as part of a rousing lecture that came tobe known as the Minnesota Speech. Fourdays later, President William McKinley wasshot in Buffalo, N.Y., and Roosevelt becamepresident. He would return in 1908, 1910,and 1912 to the fairgrounds. In modern times, more than 50,000 fairgoers heard Dwight Eisenhower callMinnesota's fair \"the greatest\" in 1947. \"TheGeneral was smart,\" the Minneapolis Star reported, \"he talked just ten minutes by theclock.\" Bill Clinton was nowhere to be found, but Vice-President Al Gore rallied the Demo-cratic faithful on Machinery Hill in 1996. BobDole skipped the fair, but was caught on filmon Commonwealth Avenue in 1987, enjoy-ing a cheese curd while visiting then-Sen.Rudy Boschwitz and his flavored milk stand. Party presence Aside from the big names at the top of the ballot, Minnesota's two major political par-ties have also enjoyed a lengthy history on thefairgrounds. The Democratic-Farmer-Laborparty originally set up shop across from theAdministration Building in 1953, the sameyear that buses replaced streetcars in St. Paul.The GOP opened their headquarters near theSt. Olaf Dining Hall six years later. While their more famous national coun- terparts stood above large grandstand crowds,state politicians operated at street level, min-gling one-on-one with fair patrons. And since 1973, state House members have mixed with the public at an information boothin the Education Building. (The state Senateopened a similar booth in 1976.) Here, law-makers have served as sounding boards andeducators, listening to the questions and con-cerns of the people. More recently, fairgoers have collectively registered their opinions forthe benefit of lawmakers. The House now administers an unofficial opinion poll at its booth, addressing issuesthat have been or may be discussed by theLegislature. During the 1996 fair, 6,540fairgoers registered an opinion on tax, educa-tion, transportation and other policy areas.(See complete results on page 18.) And so politics continues to be an integral part of the state fair, its presence as predict-able as mini-donuts and the Midway. The fairitself, begun as a marketing tool to retainfleeing pioneers, stands today as one of themost successful in the nation, and hasn't coststate taxpayers a dime since 1949. It is apublic institution, one that local hero F. ScottFitzgerald has called \"the most magnificentin America.\" \u2014 John TschidaThe law and the Minnesota State Fair In 1885, the Legislature authorized the sale of the Ramsey County PoorFarm to the State Agricultural So-ciety (for no fee) and marked$100,000 for new buildings to beerected on the site. The land, inwhat is now Falcon Heights, be-came the permanent site of the statefair. In 1895, concerned that its image of families and fun was being tar-nished, the Legislature outlawedgambling at the state fair. In 1909, a special House committee investigated the agricultural soci-ety in the wake of allegations madeagainst the fair's managers. Ac-counting practices were found tobe irregular, but Gov. John Johnsoncleared the board of any wrongdo-ing. In 1933, it became illegal to conduct any circus in any city or within aradius of six miles of any city 18days prior to the opening of theMinnesota State Fair (or duringthe fair). The penalty for violationremains up to a year in jail and a$3,000 fine. A 1945 law outlawing bingo led to the cancellation of all such gameson the fairgrounds, beginning in1947. (The 1945 state fair was can-celed due to World War II. The1946 fair was not held due to thepolio epidemic.) In 1949, the fair received its last direct appropriation from the Leg-islature, a one-time payment of$400,000 to replace the damagedHippodrome. Total appropriationsfrom the state, throughout fair his-tory, reach $3.5 million. In 1980, tattoo artist David Yerkew sued the fair under the First andFourteenth Amendments, for de-nying his concession applicationfor the third time. The fair said itwas a health hazard, and was sup-ported by U.S. District Court JudgeHarry MacLaughlin, who ruled tat-tooing was not \"sufficiently com-municative\" enough to deserveconstitutional protection. 1996 fairgoers had the opportunity to look up theirlegislative district as part of the House Fair exhibit.18 SESSION WEEKLY / January 10, 19971.

Lambert3 January 17, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . Jan. 9 - 16, 1997 Highlights Legislation that would remove current statutory caps on K-12 education spending has received top billing in the House this year and is moving quickly towardpassage. The first bill introduced in the House dur- ing the 1997 session would remove educationspending caps that are scheduled to cut $337million from public school funding duringthe 1998-99 biennium. \"People from one end of the state to the other have been asking us to restore the fund-ing cuts that were in the bill passed in 1995,\"said Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring LakePark), who is sponsor of the legislation.\"House File 1 is a response to those requests.\" Johnson's bill, backed by strong bipartisan support, easily won approval in the HouseEducation Committee on Jan. 14 after meet-ing a similar response in the committee'sK-12 Finance Division the previous day. Thebill now awaits a hearing in the House TaxesCommittee. The HF1 designation is reserved for legis- lation that House leadership deems to be atop priority for the biennium, and the desig-nation is highly sought after by members ofthe body. Recent measures to receive such distinc- tion include a 1995 welfare reform bill and a1993 measure to streamline the House com-mittee structure. Other proposals receivingthe designation include 1983 legislation seek-ing a Minnesota Equal Rights Amendment tothe state constitution. The House and Senate don't always agree on which legislation deserves top billing atthe beginning of session. This year, SenateFile 1 ( SF1) is a bill that would provide a state response to recent federal welfare reforms. The Senate companion to HF1 has been introduced as SF3. Current caps on education spending are the result of legislation passed during the1995 special session. Under the law, schooldistricts would see a reduction over the nextbiennium in the per-pupil funds they receivefor all grade levels. Additional reductionswould affect the formula used to calculatefunding levels for secondary students.House File 1 . . . Top priority: elimination of K-12 spending caps HF1 would scuttle all that and permit fund- ing at current levels and using current for-mulas. The measure is moving on the fasttrack because supporters want it sent to thegovernor before the end of January. \"It's very important for my school district and for school districts across the state thatthis bill be passed and that it be passed early,\"said Jan Witthuhn, superintendent of theMounds View School District. Local officials want quick passage of Johnson's bill because budgeting for the 1997-98 academic year is already under way inmany districts and will be starting soon inothers. With the caps in place, Mounds View schools \u2014 like those in many other districts\u2014 would have to absorb a significant reduc-tion in funding. The district likely wouldhave to endure teacher layoffs and wide-spread program reductions. The bill would allow districts to plan their budgets on the assumption that they willreceive at least the current level of funding.(Lawmakers are expected to pass legislationlater in the session setting the actual amountappropriated to schools. Johnson's bill freeslegislators to set education funding at anylevel they deem appropriate.)As long as the caps are in place, districts must prepare for the worst, said Russell Smith,superintendent of the Cloquet School Dis-trict. That means the district likely wouldembark on the process of cutting staff, in-cluding the issuance of layoff notices. Smith reflected the view of the many dis- trict officials, school administrators, parentsand others who urged the House educationpanels to pass HF1 . He detailed new and growing demands \u2014 such as ever-changing technology and state-wide testing for graduation standards \u2014 thatpromise to put a crunch on school resources. \"We wish we weren't here to talk about caps,\" Smith said. \"In fact, we'd rather have adiscussion regarding the things we need afterthe cuts are restored.\" Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids) ques- tioned the wisdom of including caps in the1995 law and wondered what effect the wholeaffair will have on the Legislature's credibility. \"What happens if we actually do have to cut the budget one of these years? Is anyonegoing to believe us out there?\" Kinkel said.\". . . I'm happy we're doing this [removing thecaps], but it never should have gotten to thispoint.\" \u2014 Nick HealyMeg Moynihan, center , an 8th grade student at Highview Middle School in New Brighton, reminded members of the K-12 Education Finance Committee that her generation would be caring for their generationas she testified in support of a bill Jan. 13 that restores education funding cuts.

Alice Johnson.4 SESSION WEEKLY / January 17, 1997CRIME Repeat offenders Almost 60 percent of prisoners released in Minnesota are re-arrested for new felonies orgross misdemeanors within three years oftheir release. That's one of the findings of arecent study by the Legislative Auditor's of-fice discussed Jan. 15 before the House Judi-ciary Committee. The panel met with the study's authors, community members and crime preventionrepresentatives to further examine the report'sfindings and consider action. \"DoesMinnesota's model work or doesn't it?\" askedRep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove). The report's purpose was to determine the extent to which felons are arrested for newoffenses; which types of criminals are mostlikely to offend again; and how other factors,such as personal characteristics, programparticipation and criminal history relate tothe likelihood of recidivism. Among otherfactors the report studied are the race, ageand marital status of prisoners. The report studied 9,000 adult felons who had been released from prison or placed onprobation in 1992. Ninety-two percent weremale; 73 percent were less than 35 years old atthe time of release, and 81 percent were eithernever married, divorced, or separated. About58 percent were white; 29 percent, black; 8percent, Native American; 4 percent, His-panic; and 1 percent, other. Among the report's other findings: Sex and homicide offenders were the leastlikely to be arrested for new crimes, whilevehicle thieves were the most likely, alongwith property offenders in general. The re-port speculates that criminals typically com-mit fewer crimes as they grow older, and thatsome crimes are committed for which thereis no arrest. Young offenders had higher re-arrest and conviction rates than others on probation.It found that overall, younger criminalsare more likely to re-offend. Felons placed on probation for violent crimes, rather than sentenced to prisonterms, were more likely than others onprobation to commit additional violentcrimes.\"It is unclear whether recidivism rates could be reduced through changes in sentencing,offender supervision, or rehabilitative pro-grams. But, regardless of the correctionalstrategies selected, we think that reliable re-cidivism information should be collected andreviewed on a regular basis,\" the report con- cludes. \"The report puts the points on the table for you to debate and discuss,\" said Joel Alter ofthe auditor's office, who reminded members:\"Recidivism rates are not a perfect measureof how well our criminal justice system isworking.\" Lawmakers realize there are no simple so- lutions. \"I think the first concern now is whether we need to reinvent the wheel because ofrecidivism, or increase or change our effortson the corrections and prevention sides,\"said Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley).\"We need to invest in what works with newtypes of criminals, who are becoming youngerand more violent. How do we address at-riskjuveniles?\" Stopping stalking The House Judiciary Committee approved legislation Jan. 14 to strengthen and clarifyMinnesota's anti-stalking law. The measure HF5 would revise the 1993 anti-stalking statute that ran into a Minne-sota Supreme Court challenge in September1996. The law has been labeled unclear andbecause of a recent Supreme Court ruling,some suggest it offers victims no more pro-tection from stalking than any law did priorto 1993. Specifically, the Minnesota Supreme Court, in State of Minnesota v. Orcello, concluded that, as written, the law leaves prosecutorswith the burden of proving a defendant had North Minneapolis resident Mary Clark, a victimof stalking, testified before the House JudiciaryCommittee Jan. 13 in favor of a bill designed tomake it easier to prosecute stalkers.EDUCATIONSCHOOLcriminal intent when stalking a victim. Thatcan be difficult because stalkers often claimaffectionate or benign motives for their be-havior. To clear up the confusion, Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) has intro-duced a bill specifically stating that the pros-ecution \". . . is not required to prove that theactor intended to cause the victim to feelfrightened, threatened, oppressed, perse-cuted, or intimidated . . .\" An amendment by committee chair Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) also changed thedefinition of \"harass\" under current law,which focuses on whether a \"reasonable per-son\" would feel intimidated. \"Harass,\" under the Skoglund amendment, would mean engaging in intentional conduct\"which the actor knows or should know wouldcause the victim under the circumstances tofeel frightened, threatened, oppressed, perse-cuted or intimidated.\" In other words, theamendment switches the focus to how thevictim was made to feel, rather than how theperpetrator meant or intended the actions. Not all committee members were satisfied that the bill answers all the questions raisedby the Minnesota Supreme Court. Still othermembers maintained the 1993 anti-stalkinglaw is still valuable, despite the Orcello ruling. HF5 now moves to the House floor. Supporting Youth Works Supporters of Minnesota's Youth Works say the program is so successful, the stateshould continue its investment. Lawmakers in 1993 set up the Youth Works program, which allows Minnesotans who areat least 17 years old to earn grants for collegeor other post-secondary education while per-forming community service. The 1993 law included a sunset provision to eliminate the program on June 30, 1998.But supporters of Youth Works are pushingto keep the program alive with continuedstate dollars. The state set aside $5 million for the pro- gram during the 1994-1995 biennium and$3.7 million during the 1996-1997 biennium. Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul), who sponsored the original Youth Works legisla-tion, testified before the K-12 FinanceDivision of the House Education Committeeon Jan. 15 to urge continued support of theprogram. Youth Works is a state-funded version of AmeriCorps, a federal community service5 January 17, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY program created by President Clinton's Na- tional Service Trust Act. Youth Works and AmeriCorps function under one administrative apparatus in Min-nesota. The bulk of the funding for YouthWorks-AmeriCorps comes from the federalgovernment. Full-time participants in the program re- ceive a $4,725 educational award upon com-pleting 1,700 hours of service. Full-timeparticipants also receive a monthly stipendfor living expenses and other benefits such aschild care. Youth Works-AmeriCorps is now in its third year in Minnesota, and 475 people arecurrently enrolled in the program. About 350people completed the program in its firstyear. That number jumped to 409 in thesecond year. St. Paul resident Elise Nelson completed two years as a member of Youth Works-AmeriCorps and is now a team leader withFuture Force, a group of program memberswho work with children in troubled St. Paulneighborhoods. Nelson was out of work and receiving wel- fare when she became involved with YouthWorks-AmeriCorps, and she credits the pro-gram with giving her life a new direction. \"I would much rather work and gain expe- rience than sit at home, get a $500 (welfare)check, and think about what I'm going to dowith my life,\" she told committee members.\"This has been a great help to me, and I can'tsay enough about it.\" Nelson's story and others like it demon- strate the benefits of the program, accordingto supporters. Mary Jo Richardson, who heads the Youth Works Team in the Department of Children,Families and Learning, said the state gets agood return on its investment. First, there arethe immediate benefits of the work performedby program members and, later, the stateenjoys further benefits because participantsgain job skills and boost their lifelong earningpotential. Richardson expects Gov. Arne Carlson to recommend continued funding for YouthWorks in his 1998-99 biennial budget. The program seems to have impressed Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), who said YouthWorks deserves continued bipartisan sup-port. \"I think it's the model of the kind of pro- gram we want to have,\" he said. Five-year-old Charles Lenz, Rochester, peersbetween two columns on the second-floorrailing in the Capitol rotunda to get a good lookat the Christian Home Education Orchestra,which performed there Jan. 15.Surplus for education? An education funding panel began the 1997 session by discussing the anticipated statebudget surplus \u2014 how much it is and howmuch of it will be available for new proposals. A November 1996 forecast predicts a sur- plus of $1.4 billion in state coffers at the endof the 1998-1999 biennium. In recent weeks,the surplus and its potential use \u2014 anythingfrom income tax rebates to property tax reliefto construction of a new baseball stadium \u2014have been the center of much attention. Andthe forecast surplus is expected to be a majortopic of debate as lawmakers prepare theeducation budget for the next biennium. The K-12 Finance Division of the House Education Committee on Jan. 8 consideredthe matter during the panel's first meetingunder Chair Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee). The panel did not delve into specific pro- posals for use of forecasted extra funds. In-stead, lawmakers stuck to a rather generaldiscussion of the state's education obliga-tions and how they could affect the surplus. The surplus is the result of many factors at work. On one hand, a robust state economyhas resulted in higher revenue levels thanexpected, and, on the other hand, state spend-ing on human services programs and in otherareas has been lower than forecast.Kelso was quick to point out that the an- ticipated $1.4 billion surplus is not all moneyin the bank. About $522 million in surplusfunds will be on hand at the close of thecurrent fiscal year (June 30, 1997). The rest ofthe $1.4 billion sum comes from forecasts ofstate revenue and expenditures during thenext biennium. \"A very small change (in the economy) can change these figures massively \u2014 up ordown,\" Kelso said. Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer (R-Princeton) said much of the surplus revenue could beconsumed just to meet current educationspending demands. The predicted $1.4 billion surplus pre- sumes that caps on education spending dur-ing the next biennium will remain intact. A 1995 education funding law enacted the caps as a method to control future educationspending, but the present caps would causesignificant cuts in the funding school dis-tricts now receive from the state for the nexttwo years. House leadership in both parties has ex- pressed a will to remove the caps, and a bill(HF1 ) to do so already has been introduced. If the caps are removed, about $337 mil- lion would be subtracted from the forecastsurplus. Removal of the caps and other existing demands could gobble up much of the sur-plus \"without doing anything new,\"Koppendrayer said. An administration official said Gov. Arne Carlson considers the forecast surplus to be\"one-time moneys\" and that the governorwill cast a cautious eye on proposals to usesurplus revenues for ongoing programs. \"If we do that, we're going to be back here two years from now trying to get ourselvesout of a dilemma that could have beenavoided,\" said Ron Hackett, of the Depart-ment of Finance. Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park) said lawmakers should be equally cautiousabout using the forecast surplus to replace taxrevenue. \"It would seem to me that we have to be looking very carefully at both our incomeand expenditures as we plan for the future,\"Johnson said.

That was the message the Governmental Operations Committee's State GovernmentFinance Division heard at meetings on Jan.13 and Jan. 15, when representatives of thetwo agencies presented performance reviewreports. Since 1993, 22 state agencies have been required to present reviews to the Office ofthe Legislative Auditor to give lawmakers abetter idea of what taxpayers receive for theirhard-earned dollars. \"The reports refocus the budget process from, 'How much?' to 'What are we getting,'\"said Joel Alter of the auditor's office. The story from Minnesota's Department of Military Affairs is one of mostly goodnews, agency representatives told the StateGovernment Finance Division Jan. 13. The department has done a remarkable job recruiting and retaining soldiers, said Brig.Gen. Gary LeBlanc, the National Guard'sassistant adjutant commander. In addition,LeBlanc said, the Guard has increased itsoverall efficiency while at the same time en-hancing the quality of life in the communitieswhere it has a presence. For example, LeBlanc said, some soldiers need a certain amount of training with heavyconstruction equipment, such as bulldozersand front-end loaders. Rather than just movea pile of dirt around, he explained, Guardsoldiers will go into a community and build aball field. \"Will you folks be bidding on the stadium here?\" Rep. Kevin Knight (R-Bloomington)asked, provoking laughter in the chamber. \"No, I don't think so,\" LeBlanc said.However, he said, the Guard continues to be plagued by a backlog of much-neededrepairs to its armories around the state. \"We're falling behind in minor repairs to our facilities,\" which total more than 1.5million square feet, LeBlanc told the department was ac-tively pursuing solutions to the problem. The Department of Revenue, said Deputy Commissioner Mathew Smith, has effectivelyachieved its goals and laid a firm foundationto ensure continued improvement. Thosegoals, he said, include: everyone paying exactly what is owed \u2014 no more, no less; satisfied customers; a fair, efficient, reliable, and understandable revenue system; and well-trained employees. The revenue department collects nearly $9 billion in taxes and operates on a budget of$81 million. The finance division will continue to hear agency performance reviews throughoutJanuary. Among the departments reportingwill be the Departments of Finance, Em-ployee Relations, and Veterans Affairs. TAXES $ Minnesota Attorney General Skip Humphrey, left, \"Just Says No\" to the offer of a cigarette from Joe Camel outside the House chamber prior to Gov. Arne Carlson's State of the State address Jan.16. Joe Camel was part of a group protesting against a proposed 10-cent increase in the cigarettetax that would help build a new baseball stadium for the Minnesota Twins.The price we pay The House Taxes Committee heard first- hand Jan. 14 how the state's \"Price of Gov-ernment\" law works and \u2014 in the opinion oflocal government officials \u2014 how it doesn't. \"The Price of Government is difficult to visualize and confusing for city officials,\"said James Miller, executive director of theLeague of Minnesota Cities. \"It is truly coun-terproductive.\" The Price of Government law, enacted in March 1995, is aimed at recognizing anddecreasing the financial burden on Minne-sota taxpayers. Expressed as a percentage, itshows the maximum share of Minnesota per-sonal income to be collected in taxes andother revenues to pay for state and localgovernment services. The resulting \"Price of Government\" is then used by lawmakers as agoal when assembling the state's budget. According to the law, the governor recom- mends revenue targets for the next two bien-nia, which specify the division of the sharebetween state and local government and de-tail the revenue mix, be it tax, fee or someother type. The Legislature must then adoptrevenue targets by March 15. (Capital gainstaxes are not included in the projection.) The law also calls for a reduction in the Price of Government, or tax burden, from18.2 percent of personal income in the 1996-97 biennium to 17.8 percent in the 1998-99spending cycle. Moreover, according to anAug. 9, 1996, letter written by Department ofRevenue Commissioner Jim Girard to Min-nesota mayors, the \"adopted revenue targetsincorporate a declining ratio for cities as agroup . . . ,\" to discourage local governmentsfrom raising taxes in their communities, lestthey exceed the state targets. Girard also wrote that the November 1996 budget forecast \"set the stage for a new priceof government resolution.\" That forecast re-vealed that given current state spending obli-gations, the state budget surplus will stand at$1.4 billion at the end of the next biennium. Girard told panel members he wrote the letter, and a Dec. 11 follow-up, as a reactionto what he called alarming increases in localtax levies. Local government officials, though, dis- agreed with Girard. They said the increasedlocal levies reflect the individual needs of the7 January 17, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY respective communities, something the Price of Government law fails to consider. The Price of Government statistic, Miller said, has mutated from its initial role as afiscal planning tool into a mechanism thatprevents a municipality from spending moneyto meet the needs of its citizens. \"I think all of us would say . . . we agree with the purpose of the Price of Government,\"Miller said. \"Our concern is with how it isapplied.\" Several other local government officials offered similar testimony. Lobbyists repre-senting local and statewide business inter-ests, who were also scheduled to address thecommittee, will be rescheduled for a laterdate, according to Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls),committee chair. Lobbyists, lawmakers, and legislative staff roasted Bill Marx, House fiscal analyst for the K-12Education Finance Division, Jan. 13. Marx, who has been named the House's Chief Fiscal Analyst,served the committee for nearly 20 years. Some adorned themselves in Marx-like beards, sinceimitation is the most sincere form of flattery. It's a fact! Minnesota's first legislators could not spend much time pondering their archi-tecturally humble surroundings. They hadto get things done before the dinnercrowd arrived. The 27 members of the Minnesota Territory's first Legislature convenedSept. 3, 1849, at the Central House, ahotel located on the corner of Secondand Minnesota streets in St. Paul. The hotel, a two-story log house with a frame addition to the back, wasthe only suitable location available forlawmakers to meet and tackle the taskof organizing a government on thefrontier. And the early Minnesota legislators had to accept some inconvenienceshard to imagine, considering the gran-deur of today's State Capitol. The 18 members of the House of Rep- resentatives met in the hotel dining room,where they had to conform to the kitchen'sschedule. After breakfast, the room was cleared, and the lawmakers' desks were moved infor the morning session. At about 11:30a.m., House members hauled their smalldesks into a hotel office to make the roomavailable for lunch to be served. After lunch, House members again had the room to themselves, but they had tomove out in time for supper. The nine-member Council (now theSenate) met upstairs in what was called the ladies' parlor \u2014 a room used for businessduring the daylight hours and for lodgingat night. Upon completion of each day's work, the Council members' desks were movedto the side and straw ticks and blanketswere placed on the open floor to serve asbedding for some of the lawmakers. The territory's first Legislature included some impressive figures who would go onto lead prominent lives in Minnesota afterstatehood. The group included William Marshall, a future Minnesota governor and CivilWar general, and Morton Wilkinson, who later served in the U.S. House and Senate. Despite their surroundings, the first Legislature created the foundation ofgovernment in the Minnesota Terri-tory, a vast piece of land stretchingfrom the current state border in theeast to the Missouri River in the west(running through present-day NorthDakota and South Dakota). Laws were passed to create counties and courts, establish a tax system,form public schools and set up theMinnesota Historical Society. The first territorial Legislature also passed a resolution declaring St. Paulthe temporary seat of government. It wasn't until the meeting of the fifth territorial Legislature in 1854 that Minnesota had its first Capitol, a rela-tively grandiose building with chambersfor both legislative branches, the SupremeCourt, and the governor. After Minnesota was granted statehood in 1858, the first Capitol was used untilbeing destroyed by fire in 1881. A secondCapitol was completed in 1883 and wasalmost immediately declared unsatisfac-tory. The third and current Capitol wascompleted in 1905.

ArneH. Carlson delivered his 1997 State of theState address Jan. 16, asking lawmakers toroll up their sleeves, work together, and con-tinue the pattern of solid economic growthand innovative social reform that, he said, isnow well under way. Carlson spoke before a joint session of the full Legislature in the House chamber. He hiton the areas of fiscal policy, educa-tion, health care, and job creation,as well as described his hopes forthe future. The speech will air onC-SPAN soon. Carlson \u2014 who will retire from public office at the end of his cur-rent term in 1998 \u2014 began hisappearance by asking lawmakersto provide $20 million in disasteraid for Minnesotans struggling tocope with this winter's heavy snow-fall and brutal cold. State officialsare pursuing federal relief, headded. Some Minnesota countiesalready have been declared disas-ter areas by the federal govern-ment. \"The state of the state is cold,\" Carlson said, explaining the needfor the emergency legislation. \"Thereality is that there are calls forhelp . . . I do not want any official\u2014 state or local \u2014 to make anydecision that places money overthe safety or well-being of ourpeople.\" Moving into the text of his speech, Carlson recalled how, atthe time of his initial State of theState appearance in 1991,Minnesota's budget ran $1.8 bil-lion in the red and state spendingdrastically exceeded revenue bynearly $800,000 a day. Today, hecontinued, the budget is in theblack, spending is under control,and the state has regained its AAAbond rating from two of the threecredit agencies that assign them,with the third soon to come. \"Minnesota is ranked among the top five states in financial management, and I wouldargue that we're one of the top two,\" Carlsonsaid, adding that he plans to propose a tax cutthat will \"return $500 million to Minnesotataxpayers.\"State of the State . . . Legislature hears governor's vision for Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson delivered his State of the State address Jan. 16 in what maybe his last major appearance as governor. He does not plan to seek re-electionin 1998. Carlson pointed out that as part of his first State of the State Address,Minnesota's budget was in the red. Today, there's a $1.4 billion surplus.As part of his speech, Carlson listed many areas in which the state has become a nationalleader under his administration. The package of reforms adopted in 1992, which later became known as MinnesotaCare,has provided health care for tens of thou-sands of low- and moderate-income peoplewho otherwise would be uninsured. In fact,he continued, the 1994 expansion of the pro-gram provided it for thousands more. Many DFL legislators have expressed the desire to extend the scope of the program again duringthe current session; Carlson did not mentionthe idea during his speech. The governor also took credit for creating more than 300,000 new jobs in the state sincehe took office in 1991. Indeed, he said, Min- nesota has added new jobs at a pace that faroutstrips that of the country, especially in themanufacturing sector of the economy. Carlson credited Minnesota's pro-business climate \u2014 driven by last year's comprehen-sive workers' compensation reform \u2014 withmaking job creation easier. \"That's what it's all about,\" Carlson said. \"This is getting Minnesota back on the right track.\" In outlining his agenda for his final term as governor, Carlsonreferred to Minnesota as a com-munity, and he called on legisla-tors to keep that in mind. Yourjob, he told them, is to balance theneeds of your district with theneeds of the state and work as acommunity for agreement inmatters of public policy. Carlson defined two areas as most in need of immediate legis-lative agreement: property tax re-form and pay raises for stateagency commissioners. The gov-ernor later included judges, con-stitutional officers, and legislatorsas deserving candidates for payincreases. Property tax reform, Carlson said, means property tax relief,primarily in the commercial/in-dustrial sector of the economy.Without such measures, he ex-plained, Minnesota will see its bidto grow more jobs stymied. Minnesota's future, the gover- nor said, is tied to its children.Without them, there can be nofuture. Toward that end, Carlsonproposed a new series of invest-ments in pre-school programs andan increase in child care funding. He also unveiled initiatives aimed at combating what manysocial scientists say is a emergingjuvenile crime wave. The gover-nor called for increased fundingfor courts and judges, beefed-up penalties for drive-by shootings, sex crimesand stalking, and more aggressive police tac-tics, including street sweeps and communitypolicing. He also held up New York City's \"Broken Windows\" program, which is based on the9 January 17, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYpremise that small gestures, such as repairing broken windows, ultimately translate into anincreased pride in the community and a de-crease in crime. \"I want the mayor of New York City, in his State of the City address, to be pointing toMinnesota and saying, 'Why can't we be assafe as Minnesota?'\" Carlson said. Carlson also made education reform \u2014 at every level\u2014 a centerpiece of his address. With a nod to outgoing University of Min- nesota President Nils Hasselmo andHasselmo's successor, is intimately tied to job growth.Minnesota must continue to partner its insti-tutions of higher education with industry.We must also, he said, reform our K-12 sys-tem. Too many children, he stated, cannotpass even the most basic skills tests. \"If our kids do not succeed in K-12,\" Carlson said, \"we, as a state, will not suc-ceed.\" The governor also pointed out that a com- munity is defined by its culture, which in-cludes arts and sports. In addition to increasesin funding for nonprofit arts organizations toallow for more touring around the state, thegovernor emphasized his desire for a newbaseball stadium. \"Like the arts, sports give us a strong com- munity . . . I do not want future generationsto tune in the television or the radio to listento the Memphis Twins,\" Carlson said. \"Theyare our Twins.\" Carlson pointed out that the Legislature has a long history of subsidizing private in-dustry, including tax-increment financingand revenue bonds. He asked lawmakers toremember the Northwest Airlines package ofseveral years ago and recalled several smallerefforts around the state, such as a potatoplant in Park Rapids, an ice rink in Roseville,and direct financing of political campaigns. In a pointed barb at stadium foes, Carlson said he did not want Minnesota's future de-fined by critics. \"The only period in history that was ever built by critics,\" he said, \"was called the DarkAges.\" \u2014 F.J. GallagherLeaders react to governor's address The reaction of legislative leaders to Gov. Arne Carlson's State of the State Address was often enthusiastic and always diplomatic \u2014 except when it cameto one issue. Which issue? The baseball stadium.Carlson urged support for construction of a new baseball stadium to be financed through an additional 10-cent tax on every pack of cigarettes. The governor detailed the many ways the state aids business \u2014 such as tax breaks and direct subsidies \u2014 and he characterized the proposed baseballstadium as a way to create employment and improve the quality of life inMinnesota. House and Senate leaders were polite about the stadium issue, but they made it clear that public funding for the project will be a tough sell in theLegislature. \"My sense is that the citizens of this state are telling us not to put tax dollars into professional sports,\" said House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon). Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe (DFL-Erskine) said the 1997 Legislature faces issues, including welfare reform and education funding, that are morepressing than the stadium debate. \"The Legislature is not spending near as much time on the stadium issue as, perhaps, people are being led to believe,\" he said. Moe refrained from weighing in one way or the other on Carlson's proposal to use a cigarette tax to pay for a stadium. Moe said he will not pass judgmentuntil a comprehensive stadium proposal is released. \"I think it's premature for me and any of my colleagues to make any comment until we get all the pieces of the financial puzzle,\" he said. House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center) spoke only gener- ally about the proposed stadium, acknowledging it only as \"a very controver-sial issue.\" Carruthers stressed the many similarities between the governor's agenda and that of the DFL. Those similarities, according to the speaker, include adesire to bolster public education, protect the environment, and support thearts. \"I was happy to hear the governor call for bipartisan cooperation,\" Carruthers said. \"I think that's what we need as a state. I think there is a tremendousnumber of issues where there is going to be bipartisan cooperation.\" House Majority Leader Ted Winter (DFL-Fulda) also had little enthusiasm for the governor's stadium proposal, but he did find some things he liked inthe governor's words. \"Overall, it was a good speech,\" Winter said. \"His heart is in the right place with education and welfare reform.\" The governor renewed his call for tax-free savings accounts to reward parents who put away money for their children's college education. He alsocalled on lawmakers to provide more money to improve technology in theschools. Sviggum expressed support for the tax-free savings account program (dubbed \"Edvest\") and other initiatives outlined in Carlson's speech. \"Overall, there were no surprises, but it was consistent,\" Sviggum said. \"The governor stressed education, juvenile justice, and living within our means.\" Carlson also made repeated pleas to lawmakers and all Minnesotans to set aside parochial interests and work for the common good. Senate Minority Leader Dean Johnson (R-Willmar), a Lutheran pastor, noticed \"religious overtones\" in the governor's request that Minnesotans pulltogether. \"This was my ninth State of the State, and this was the best one that I've heard,\" Johnson said. \u2014Nick HealyFeedback Send e-mail comments regarding Session Weekly to: session@house.leg.state.mn.us We thank you for your input. The staff10 SESSION WEEKLY / January 17, 1997 The Minnesota House of Representatives' new majority leader, Rep. Ted Winter (DFL -Fulda), sees a lot of similarity between hisrole as a party official and his full-time jobrunning the family farm in the southwesternpart of the state. \"Farmers have to collect a lot of informa- tion,\" about seed, fertilizers, equipment, andfinances to be successful, Winter said, \"butthere comes a time when you have to get onthe tractor seat and plant the corn . . . it's thesame thing in the Legislature. Legislatorsgather a lot of information, but there comesa time when you have to do the deal. You haveto put 67 votes up on the board to meet theneeds of the people of Minnesota. As major-ity leader, it's my job to make sure we get thatdone.\" For Winter, 47, now in his sixth term, that job promises to be no small task. Party lead-ers have set an ambitious agenda for the 80thSession of the Minnesota Legislature, includ-ing the removal of current spending caps thatwould cost Minnesota schools more than$300 million in funding and reworking theproperty tax code, a primary source of educa-tion dollars. The House also must addresschanges in the welfare system, in addition toongoing health care issues and a growingjuvenile crime problem that, Winter said, hasrobbed people of their sense of security. When the rural voters in District 22A first elected him in 1986, Winter said, nobodyworried about becoming the victim of a drive-by shooting. Instead, most of his neighborswere too busy struggling with an expandingmorass of debt, the result of skyrocketinginterest rates that threatened to bankrupttheir farms. Long before he ever thought of running for office, Winter, along with several of his friends,decided that something had to be done aboutthe burgeoning financial threat. He beganorganizing the community to take some po-litical action, mobilizing the farmers aroundthe state with the \"Groundswell\" movement. Then Gov. Rudy Perpich showed up at one such event and Winter gave him a firsthandaccount of the farmers' plight. Perpich, whowould soon be attending a conference ofmidwestern governors in Chicago, assuredWinter that he would raise the matter there. \"I suggested to him that he should take some farmers with him and he agreed,\" Win-ter said, a broad grin playing across his face.A few days later, Winter and a couple ofHouse Majority Leader . . . Winter tills legislative soil to benefit Minnesota friends, Larry Green and Milan Wiesneski,were on their way to Chicago. At the conference, Winter listened to a number of plans aimed at helping the strug-gling farmers, most of which involved thecreation of new paperwork. After hours oflistening, he decided he had heard enough. \"I stood up and explained to them that the only way it looked like anything would changeis if I go after one of their jobs and changethings myself,\" he said. On the way homefrom a farm rally at the Capitol in St. Paul,Winter seriously discussed the idea of run-ning for office with two friends, AndySteensma and Norman DeBlieck. They de-cided then and there to do it and all three wonelection to the House. More than a decadelater, Steensma and DeBlieck are no longerrepresentatives, but Winter has emerged asone of the DFL's leading policymakers. Assuming the mantle of House majority leader represents something of a fruition forthe affable Winter. When the \"Phonegate\"scandal of March 1993 forced former Rep.Alan Welle (DFL-Willmar) to resign his ma-jority leader post, House DFLers passed overWinter in favor of Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls), whom many perceived to have amore aggressive style of leadership. Winter maintains it is the political climate that has changed, not his leadership style.The partisanship of days gone by simplydoesn't play in today's era of narrow majori- ties, he said. The new speaker of the House, Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center) agreedwith Winter's assessment. Winter, Carrutherssaid, is lead in today'sLegislature. \"Ted is action-oriented,\" Carruthers said. \"He believes he's in the Legislature for areason \u2014 to get things done. He's a goodconsensus builder who likes to involve andwork with people. The members feel that he'sfair, yet he's a strong advocate for his own andthe party's position(s).\" Winter characterizes himself as one who leads by serving his fellow representatives,rather than forcing them to adhere to theleadership's agenda. A legislator, he explained,should always feel as if he or she has beenheard, and although the job of majority leaderis inherently partisan, perhaps his most im-portant responsibility is to impart a sense ofparticipation to the members, be they Re-publican or Democrat. \"My job is to communicate with people, to listen to them and to work with them \u2014 andthat includes Republicans \u2014 and then tocarry that into the arena,\" Winter said. \"It'salways been my strength to be a facilitatorand to get things done . . . just like a farmer,you'll reap the harvest in the end.\" \u2014 F.J. GallagherHouse Majority Leader Ted Winter sees a lot of similarities between heading the party in the House and running a family farm. \"There comes a time when you have to get on the tractor seat and plant the corn . . .it's the same thing in the Legislature. Legislators gather a lot of information, but there comes a time whenyou have to do the deal. You have to put 67 votes up on the board to meet the needs of the people ofMinnesota.\"11 January 17, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYMinnesota House of Representatives 1997 Committee Assignments by Member Abrams, Ron (R-Minnetonka) ................... 45A Property Tax & Tax Increment FinanceDivision, Lead Republican Financial Institutions & InsuranceRules & Legislative AdministrationTaxes Anderson, Bruce (R-Buffalo Township) .... 19B EducationGeneral Legislation, Veterans Affairs & Elections Governmental Operations State Government Finance Division Regulated Industries & Energy Anderson, Irv (DFL-Int'l Falls) ......................3A Financial Institutions & Insurance, ChairRegulated Industries & EnergyTaxes Property Tax & Tax Increment Finance(TIF) Division Transportation & Transit Bakk, Thomas (DFL-Cook) ............................6A Taxes, Vice ChairEnvironment & Natural ResourcesEnvironment & Natural Resources FinanceLabor-Management Relations Sales & Income Tax Division Bettermann, Hilda (R-Brandon) 10B Higher Means Biernat, Len (DFL-Mpls) .............................. 59A Judiciary, Vice Chair Civil & Family Law Division Education K-12 Education Finance Division Bishop, Dave (R-Rochester) ....................... 30B Judiciary, Lead RepublicanCapital Investment Civil & Family Law Division Ways & Means Boudreau, Lynda (R-Faribault) ................ 25B Commerce, Tourism & Consumer Affairs Family & Early Childhood EducationFinance Division Financial Institutions & InsuranceHealth & Human Services Bradley, Fran (R-Rochester ) ..................... 30A Commerce, Tourism & Consumer AffairsHealth & Human Services Health & Human Services Finance DivisionBroecker, Sherry (R-Vadnais Heights) ... 53B Judiciary Judiciary Finance Division & Carlson, Lyndon R .

As it stands today, Minnesota isamong the nation's leaders in makinggovernment information available in ahost of formats. Whether in print or bytelephone, computer, or television,nearly all of the Legislature's business isliterally at your fingertips. The Internet Since 1994, anyone with a computer and a modem has had access to legisla-tive information on the Internet. In Janu-ary 1996, the Legislature debuted on theWorld Wide Web, which provides a user-friendly format that anyone withoutcomputer training can navigate. The World Wide Web uses a simple \"point-and-click\" system, where usersselect a highlighted word or phrase suchas \"House committee schedules.\" Onceselected, the computer automatically re-trieves the requested information. It can thenbe viewed or saved to the user's own com-puter and printed. To connect to the legislative \"home page,\" simply point your web browser at:http://www.leg.state.mn.us Here, anyone from Bird Island to Burundi can easily access information about mem-bers of the Legislature, Senate and Housebills, Minnesota Statutes , daily and weekly schedules of committee activity, staff direc-tories, House and Senate journals, and muchmore. There also are links to other importantstate and federal government sites on theInternet. You can now view the Session Weekly on the Internet, with all photos and graphicsintact, at: http:// www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hinfo/swkly.ssi The Legislature's World Wide Web page is a joint effort by the Minnesota House ofRepresentatives, the Minnesota Senate, theLegislative Reference Library, and the Officeof the Revisor of Statutes. The goal of the service is to provide as much legislative information as possible inan easy-to-use format to increase citizen par-ticipation in the legislative process. And the public is responding. During the peak of the 1996 Legislative Session, theLegislature's Web pages were accessed moreInforming the public . . . Legislative information is everywhere, for free than 90,000 times per week. During the firstweek of the 1997 Legislative Session, thatnumber already stood at 70,000. E-mail Anyone with e-mail can also receive daily and weekly committee schedules from boththe House and the Senate without having toconnect to the Internet to download them. Previously available only to those visiting the Capitol or subscribing to the Session Weekly, the schedule now is sent daily to more than 500 e-mail subscribers. To receive the House schedule, send a message to: listserv@hsched.house.leg.state.mn.usLeave the subject line blank and in the body of the message type: subscribe h-schedules To receive the Senate schedule, send a message to: listserv@senate.leg.state.mn.us Leave the subject line blank and in the body of the message type: subscribe sen- schedules Television Those without computers can also follow the Legislature in the privacy of their ownhome. Beginning in 1996, coverage of theHouse and Senate began airing in the TwinCities area on KTCI-TV, Channel 17. Previ-ously, coverage of floor sessions and com-mittee hearings aired on metro-area cable Channel 6, and was available onlyto cable subscribers. Minnesota was thefirst state to make such extensive cover-age available at no charge to viewers. The number of potential viewers more than doubled, from 1.2 million to2.5 million, and the calls to the HouseTelevision Services comment line in-creased dramatically: Thousands of call-ers registered their opinions onlegislative matters. Beginning in mid-March, the House will broadcast itsbusiness via satellite statewide. Outstateresidents should check with local cableoperators for time and channel infor-mation, or the House Television Ser-vices Department's Web site at: http:// www.house.leg.state.mn.us/htv/htv.ssi All televised floor sessions and com- mittee hearings at the Minnesota Leg-islature are now closed-captioned forpeople with hearing impairments. Two hearing rooms in the State Office Building are outfitted for televisionbroadcast. Room 10, equipped with roboticcameras, is used for statewide broadcast oflegislative proceedings. There is also an inter-active television site in Room 5 of the StateOffice Building. Connected to more than 50sites throughout Minnesota, the technologyallows members of the public to testify beforethe Legislature while in locations such asDuluth or Marshall, saving time and moneyby avoiding a trip to St. Paul. The old standbys Of course there's always the printed word and the telephone. The House Public Infor-mation Office has a series of news, informa-tional, and educational publications designedto make the legislative process understand-able and accessible for citizens of all ages. Forcopies of publications, general legislative in-formation, or to subscribe to the Session Weekly newsmagazine, call (612) 296-2146, or 1-800-657-3550. For copies of pending bills, call the Chief Clerk's Office at (612) 296-2314. To discoverthe sponsor of a bill, or to find the status ofpending legislation, call House Index at (612)296-6646. Finally, to hear a recorded message of the House's committee schedule, call (612)296-9283. In recent years, the House has taken major steps to ensure that thepublic has even better access to the legislative process. The Housedebuted a World Wide Web page on the Internet in January 1996.That year also marked the first time House floor sessions andsome committee meetings were broadcast on television.17 January 17, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Youth in Government . . . Minor members storm Capitol, take reins of power The YMCA Y outh in Government program isn't just kid stuff. The 1,260 students in grades eight through 12 who reigned inthe Capitol Jan. 9-12 weren't joking - not, at least, until jokingwas on the schedule. Instead, the senators, representatives, officers, pages, gover- nor, and media personnel were there to do business. \"Part of ourmission is to promote strong citizenship, \" said Orville Lindquist, state program director. \"The idea is that whenthey're adults and go to the polls or readnewspapers, they'll have an understanding ofwhat's behind it, how the governmental pro-cess works, and how the media, lobbyists,and others influence the process. They'll knowhow they affect government and how gov-ernment affects them.\" Like their adult counterparts, the students spent the session meeting in committees andon the House and Senate floors, where theyproposed, debated, and voted on legislation. Michelle Burque, a junior at Burnsville High School, and her teddy bear worked as a mock representativein the House chamber Jan. 10 as part of the annual Youth in Government program held at the State Capitoleach session. The program divides the students by grade and unit of government. Eighth graders serveas pages; ninth and 10th graders serve in theirown three branches of government, and 11thand 12th graders in theirs. Their efforts thisyear were underlined by visits from Secretaryof State Joan Growe, Chief Justice of theMinnesota Supreme Court A.M. \"Sandy\"Keith, St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman, andSenate Majority Leader Roger Moe. The annual event was the 43rd of its kind and is sponsored by the YMCA. The programhas existed nationally since 1936, Lindquist said. Students began preparing months in ad- vance, beginning with the materials preparedby the Youth in Government organization.Training sessions were held in Septemberand October, when officers were elected.Lindquist said the program is funded throughstudent fees \u2014 averaging $280 per student \u2014and from fund-raising and donations. \"The kids come from all over Minnesota. A lot of them have an interest in public affairs,\" Lindquist said. \"There's also a social aspect to it. They have friends and relatives who havedone it and had a wonderful experience.\" Dan Borkenhagen, an 11th grader from White Bear Lake, heard about the programthrough friends and teachers and came backfor a second visit this year. \"I didn't know theparliamentary process before this and I thinkit's important to learn,\" he said. \"It's not somuch that I'm thinking of public service as acareer, but I do want to keep up with theprocess. I think the program shows kids thatthings do work and that they can be part of it. It doesn't have to be over their heads.\" Borkenhagen proposed a bill to make chain gangs part of the penal code. \"I'd like to seestricter rules, so that criminals can see how anact will be punished. I think punishment, notjust rehabilitation, should be part of thecrime.\" While some of his fellow membershad expressed opposition to the idea,Borkenhagen said he thought it had a goodchance of passage. Sarah Kampbell and Kellie Norman, both in 11th grade at Lakeville High School, re-turned this year for their third terms. Theyagreed that absent their Youth in Govern-ment experiences, they wouldn't know howmuch work it takes to pass laws. Kampbellhad authored legislation to make vehiclemaintenance a mandatory part of the highschool curriculum. \"People can't always makeinformed decisions. I've had so many prob-lems with my car and been ripped off bymechanics,\" she said. How much chance didshe think the bill had of passage? \"None.\" Norman wrote a bill that required parents who home-school their children to have atleast a minimal level of post-secondary edu-cation. She was motivated by a family sheknew in which the children's test scoresdropped after they began school at home, shesaid. She was uncertain of its chances on thefloor. By the second day of session in the Humphrey House \u2014 made up of legislatorsin the ninth and 10th grades \u2014 the mood hadbecome less business-like and the speakercontinually demanded: \"Will the undercur-rent please cease!\" But not everyone had losttheir sense of commitment. Weldon Green, a ninth-grader at Shakopee Junior High, listened as various bills came upfor debate, including one to mandate coun-seling for divorcing couples. Others propos-als included increasing the cigarette tax,providing vegetarian meals in school cafete-rias, and suspending the drivers' licenses ofparents who fail to pay child support. Last year Green served as a page and hoped to come back next year as either a cabinetmember or committee chair. \"There weremore controversial bills last year and it wasmore fun to debate. This has been prettymundane,\" he said. \"Tomorrow we can in-troduce joke bills. That will relieve the ten-sion.\" Peter Rodosovich, who served in the Min- nesota House of Representatives from18 SESSION WEEKLY / January 17, 19971982-1995, got his start in public service through the YMCA Youth in Governmentprogram. \"That's what got me hooked andinterested in government,\" he said. \"I was theyouth Senate committee chair, and later theyouth lieutenant governor.\" Today, Rodosovich is the State Executive Director of the Youth in Government pro-gram. He said it's not unusual for the pro- gram to have a life-long impact on students.\"This year I noticed that the numbers andinterest in the program have increased. Weadded 125 more participants,\" he said. \"Theyouth leadership was very strong, and theytook their roles very seriously.\" \"I think it's great that the members of the Minnesota House and Senate, the judiciarybranch and constitutional officers were sosupportive and allowed the kids to use thechambers and offices. It gives them a chanceto feel what it's really like to make those kindsof decisions,\" he said. \u2014 Celeste Riley First-termer Rep. Kathy Tingelstad (R- Andover) is no stranger to elective politics.While in high school in the 1970s, Tingelstad served as an intern forformer state Sen. Rob-ert Stassen (R-South St.Paul) who, she said, en-couraged her to run foroffice someday. For years, Tingelstad avoided the senator'sadvice, opting instead to become involved in a less conspicuous man-ner. Indeed, over the years, she's worked indifferent capacities for a variety of candi-dates, ultimately managing successful cam-paigns for former state Rep. Teresa Lynch(R-Andover). In addition, she worked as alegislative assistant in Washington, D.C., onAl Quie's staff prior to his becoming gover-nor of Minnesota \"The other day I tried to figure out exactly how many envelopes I've stuffed for variouscampaigns through the years,\" she said, laugh-ing, \"and I couldn't do it. The closest I couldcome was that it was over 100,000.\" Finally, this mother of two took Stassen's advice and launched a bid for an open seat onthe Anoka County Board in 1993. In a field of10 candidates, Tingelstad finished third \u2014trailing by just two votes \u2014 in a race that sawthe top two finishers go on to a run-off con-test. The loss was a disappointment,Tingelstad said, but she vowed to try againwhen the time was right. An opportunity presented itself when Lynch announced that she would not run foroffice in 1996. Tingelstad, with her family'sapproval and Lynch's encouragement, de-New members . Education, environment top concerns for Tingelstad cided that she would run for state representa-tive. At 38, Tingelstad is the youngest womanin the Republican Caucus and the second-youngest woman in the House. The decision to campaign for office was by no means an easy one, Tingelstad said, be-cause it meant selling her business, a success-ful marketing and communications firm shefounded in 1985. In fact, the Small BusinessAdministration recently awarded her as theWomen in Business Advocate of the Year for1996. But running for office was somethingshe wanted to do. \"I always wanted to be a legislator,\" Tingelstad said, sitting in her second flooroffice in the State Office Building \u2014 the sameone Lynch occupied during her eight-yeartenure as a representative. \"I want to make adifference. I have two young children and I'dlike to make Minnesota a better place forthem.\" Perhaps the best way to accomplish that, Tingelstad said, is through adequately andequitably funded education, an issue sheplaces high on her legislative agenda. One of the primary mechanisms for fund- ing education, she explained, is through prop-erty tax. In her heavily residential district, thetax base isn't as large as some of those thatcontain more businesses. Consequently, thefunding allocated per pupil isn't as much as itis in other metro school districts. \"We need a more equitable formula,\" she said, adding that many voters in her district,with its growing population, share that senti-ment. In fact, Tingelstad's district has one ofthe highest populations of young families inthe state. Environmental issues also are a priority forTingelstad. As a member of the House Envi- ronment and Natural Resources Committee,Tingelstad hopes to continue work towardbalancing the rights of landowners \u2014 whoseproperty contains wetlands \u2014 with the needto preserve the environment. Tingelstad also serves on the Health and Human Services Committee. \"With welfarereform, there will be a lot of action on thiscommittee this session,\" she said. She's up forit, she explained. \"I was a volunteer lobbyisthere in the 1980s \u2014 working on adoptionissues. She also has authored four medicalbooks. Tingelstad, who holds an undergraduate degree in communications from the Univer-sity of Minnesota and an MBA certificatefrom the University of St. Thomas, said shecounts Stassen, Lynch, and Quie as perhapsher greatest political influences. Moreover,the insight gleaned from her years with Lynchmeans she's a step or two ahead of the averagefirst-term legislator. In time, she continued,she'd like to work her way up to a leadershipposition. \u2014 F.J.

Rep. Geri Evans (DFL-New Brighton) is a newcomer for a second time. She served inthe House during the 1992-94 session in Dis- trict 52B, includesparts of the Twin Cities'northwest suburbanarea, regained herseat this year. Evans said her attrac- tion to public service mayhave originated duringher childhood in BlueEarth, Minn. \"I grew up in a home where people were always drop-ping over and talking all the issues \u2014 worldaffairs, religion \u2014 everything,\" she said. \"And,even as a child and a female, my opinionswere taken seriously. I didn't realize thenhow unique that was.\" A former St. Anthony-New Brighton school board member, Evans said her first priority isquality in education. Part of her commit-ment comes from her firsthand experiencewith the difference schools and teachers canmake.New members . . . Evans rekindles friendships, focuses on education Evan's son, Jim, now 32, has a hearing disability. \"Back when he was in school, thereweren't as many proactive programs as thereare now. I had to do very heavy-duty advo-cacy to make sure he got the services heneeded.\" It would have been easy for teachersto consider him learning disabled, Evans said.\"We all have to continually check our as-sumptions. It's so important to treat all kidsfairly. Many deaf people have been sent toinstitutions for the mentally retarded.\" Today, Jim is a magna cum laude graduate of St. Cloud State University and works forHennepin County as a senior financial worker.Evans' younger son, Andrew, 26, works inlandscaping. \"What I want is for all kids to get a high- quality, well-rounded education,\" Evans said.\"I'm motivated by my experiences on theschool board, which I really enjoyed.\" Theschool board experience also led her to whatbecame one of her favorite legislative accom-plishments: keeping open an environmentalcenter which was threatened with closure.Evans authored the bonding legislation, whichprovided funds to renovate the Mounds View School District's Laurentian EnvironmentalCenter, she said. \"I've always been a negotiator and coali- tion-builder. I listen to diverse points of view.\"Evans said that the skills she developed in thatposition also are useful at the Legislature. In her nonpolitical life she's an educa- tional trainer and researcher, which, she said,means providing information and researchfor staff training and curriculum develop-ment for K-12 education and higher educa-tion organizations. Largest County: Ramsey Location: northwestern Metro Top concern: Adequate education funding. It's an important issue in every district. We did somepolling in mine and it ranked highest. A relatedissue is environmentally safe schools, due to theair-quality problems experienced at Pike Lake El-ementary school in New Brighton. \u2014 Rep. Geri EvansRep.

Dividing the chairmanship means no single member will have the abil-ity to control the committee's meet-ings, the speaker explained. In all, the committee will be made up of four members and two alter-nates, down from 10 members andtwo alternates last year. As always,there will be equal numbers ofDFLers and Republicans. \"This is a good first step in reform- ing the House ethics process,\" saidMinority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) in a prepared statement. Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL- Hermantown) and Rep. TimPawlenty (R-Eagan) will serve as co-chairs. Also serving is Rep.

Proposals in both the House and Senate ask for an extra $20 million to $25 million to help dig out Minnesota. Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) is sponsoring the House bill (HF100 ) that seeks $25 million. According to the Senate bill: \"The Legislature finds that the his- toric accumulation of snow, aggravated by drifting from high winds,and by severely cold temperatures have forced local units of govern-ment beyond their budgets for snow removal. Emergency financialassistance is necessary for the health, welfare, and safety of the citi-zens; for the ability of government, schools, hospitals, and businessesto function; and to help individuals to get access to and from theirhomes, work, schools, and markets.\" The bill ( SF87 ) is sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Dean Johnson and several other senators from southern and western Min-nesota. The Senate bill requests that $20 million in fiscal year 1997 be given to the Department of Transportation which would distribute themoney to counties that need help with their snow removal budgets. \"Southern and western Minnesota have been hit week after week by extremely devastating blizzards,\" said Johnson (R-Willmar) in aprepared statement. \"Some areas have spent more than their annualsnow removal budgets and are now depleting other program re-sources well into 1998.\" Legislators aren't the only ones calling for help. Gov. Arne Carlson is behind the idea too. In his State of the State Address, Carlson, too,called for $20 million to help plow roads and free up stranded folks inoutstate Minnesota. The governor, who has already asked the federal government for relief, said: \"The state of HF118-HF159 Session Weekly is a non-partisan publication of the Minnesota House of Representatives Public Information Office.

Minnesota House of Representatives January 24, 1997 Volume 14, Number 3 One of the most exciting events experienced by some 2,000 Minnesotans earlier this week was the inauguration of the president of the United States in Washington, D .C. Attended by Minnesota Democrats and Republicans alike, an overall patriotic feeling prevailed through\u00ad out the city, as 500,000 people from across the country came to observe, show their support, and to share in this historic 53rd inaugural celebration; the last inaugural of the 20th century. On Martin Luther King's Holiday, Jan. 20, from the U.S. Capitol Building steps, down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House and beyond, buildings, street lights, and people were arrayed with the colors of red, white, and blue. Some individuals, like a six-foot plus gentleman from Arkansas, or the Minnesota Ojibwe Indians added flair and class to the occasion. The Arkansan was a spectator who had about the same height and facial features of Abraham Lincoln, and he caused quite a positive stir as he moved through the throng adorned with top hat, morning coat, and beard. The Mille Lacs Reservation band of dancers and drummers were featured near the front of the inauguration parade and were dressed in Ojibwe ceremonial wear. They and represen\u00ad tatives of the Mille Lacs tribal council served as the official Minnesota entry in the parade. The most impressive part of the three days was the somber tone and pomp of the inaugural ceremonies. Participants on the program represented U.S. citizens from all ethnic and religious groups. With a positive look toward the future, the president reflected on the hopes and dreams of Dr. King and committed himself to the task of bringing about unity in a land of new promise for all Americans. The pre-inauguration festivities on the Mall and other areas of the city generated a prevailing feeling of celebration, high energy, and even thought-provoking reflection in seminars at the Holocaust Museum. And Minnesota legislators and ordinary citizens played their part as well. Later at the Midwest Inaugural Ball in the Air and Space Museum, they were in abundance. Between separate visits to the Ball by the president and vice president, Minnesotans schmoozed, danced, and sang along with REO Speedwagon, Stevie Wonder, and other entertainers beneath Minnesota hero Charles Lindbergh's airplane, \"The Spirit of Saint Louis,\" and the first airplane flown by the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk -both hanging from the museum's ceiling. Another group of Minnesotans who represented the state duringthe inaugural ceremonies were 95 seventh-graders from West St. Paul's FrancesM. Grass Junior High School. Sixty-one of the students, their chaperones, and three other Minnesotans were part of an unscheduled airline landing at the Madison, Wis., airport. Eleven hours into trying to get home from the nation's capital, maybe the most memorable observation of the historic inaugural event was made in Madison by one of the seventh\u00ad graders who said: \"I may be tired, but I still am really excited that I was a part of history.Now I knowwhyit is important to learn about our state government. We need to know more about the people that get elected, and somehow get more involved.\" -Leclair G.

Jan. 16 -23, 1997 H Stopping harassment ... en unclear anti-stalking law After an hour of debate, the House of Representatives passed a revised anti-stalk\u00ad ing proposal Jan. 23 on a 124-3 vote. This time, the Legislature wants to make sure its intentions are clear and understood. HFS is a revision of the state's first and only anti-stalking law, passed in 1993. The effectiveness of that law was called into ques\u00ad tion by a Minnesota Supreme Court ruling in September 1996. A number oflegislators, including the new bill's sponsor, Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights), expressed concern over the apparent lack of protection stalking victims may face in light of that ruling. For that reason, supporters sought quick legislative action. statute has centered on whether it must be proven that an alleged stalker intended to harm or intimidate the victim. Specifically, the Minnesota Supreme Court in State of Minnesota v. Orcello concluded that, as written, the law leaves prosecutors with the burden of proving a defendant had criminal intent when stalking a victim. That can be difficult because stalkers often claim affectionate or benign motives for their be\u00ad havior. To clear up the confusion, HFS specifically states that the prosecution \" ... is not required to prove that the actor intended to cause the victim to feel frightened, threatened, oppressed, persecuted, or intimidated .... \" The House Jan. 23 passed a bill that tightens Minnesota's 1993 anti-stalking law. The Minnesota Supreme Court recently ruled that the 1993 law leaves prosecutors with the burden of proving a defendant had criminal intent when stalking a victim. To clear up the confusion, the new bill states that the prosecution \" ... is not required to prove that the actor intended to cause the victim to feel frightened, threatened, oppressed, persecuted, or intimidated ... \" The new anti-stalking proposal is meant to clarify and remedy ambiguities in the 1993 law. It is also one of the first pieces of legislation to move through the 1997 Legis\u00ad lative Session. \"This is a very important piece oflegisla\u00ad tion,\" Rep. McGuire said, noting that many people have either been victims of or have known victims of stalkers. The debate surrounding the Minnesota The bill also would change the definition of\"harass\" under current law which focuses on whether a \"reasonable person\" would feel intimidated. \"Harass\" would mean engaging in inten\u00ad tional conduct \"which the actor knows or should know would cause the victim under the circumstances to feel frightened, threat\u00ad ened, oppressed, persecuted or intimidated.\" In other words, the bill switches the focus to how the victim was made to feel, rather than how the perpetrator meant or intended the actions. Anti-stalking legislation has swept through legislatures nationwide since 1990, when California passed the nation's first state\u00ad level statute on stalking. Since then, 47 other states and the District of Columbia have passed versions of their own, according to a June 1996 report from the U.S. Department of Justice. Maine is the only state without a specific law, but uses a terrorizing statute to address stalking, the report states. Last Sep\u00ad tember, President Bill Clinton signed legis\u00ad lation making interstate stalking and harass\u00ad ment a federal crime \"regardless of whether the stalker has committed an act of violence or is the spouse or an intimate of the victim, and regardless of whether the victim had a court order of protection,\" according to the New York Times. It sets penalties from up to five years in prison for harassment to life in prison for bodily injury, the Times report said. Perhaps because the laws are so new, sta\u00ad tistics on stalking incidents are hard to come by. However, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension reports that in 1995 there were 495 stalking incidents reported by law enforcement agencies in the state. In 1996, there were 535. According to evidence compiled by U.S. Senator Bill Cohen (R\u00ad Maine) as many as 90 percent of women killed by their husbands or boyfriends were stalked before the attack, news reports have said. Anti-stalking legislation has been chal\u00ad lenged in many states on constitutional and other grounds. Some of the behaviors com\u00ad mon to stalking, are, on their face, legal or seemingly harmless -such as sending let\u00ad ters, flowers, or sitting in one's car on a public street. That makes it difficult to pre\u00ad vent the law from being overly broad or violating the First Amendment right to free speech. The law also must avoid violating the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, which requires that individuals receive fair notice of the types of conduct that are pro\u00ad hibited. Other issues regard freedom of January 24, 1997 I SESSION WEEKLY 3 movement, an implied right under the Con\u00ad stitution, and vagueness. If HFS becomes law, Minnesota would be one of 16 states in which the law focuses on the effect the stalker's actions have on the victim, regardless of whether the actor's in\u00ad tentions can be proven. Currently, the maximum penalty in Min\u00ad nesota for the first stalking conviction, a gross misdemeanor, is up to a year impris\u00ad onment and a fine of $3,000. Subsequent convictions are felonies that can result in up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $10,000. If a pattern of terror is established against a single person or household, a prison term of up to 10 years and a $20,000 fine is possible. Nationwide, a stalking conviction typically results in a jail sentence of up to a year. Penalties of three to five years are com\u00ad mon for felony convictions, the Justice De\u00ad partment report said. After pointed debate on the broadness of the law, and its subsequent potential to be abused, McGuire successfully defended its ability to pass constitutional muster. HFS now moves to the Senate. -Celeste Riley BONDING Better bond rating Minnesota has a good chance of receiving a money-saving upgrade in its bond rating, according to the head of the Department of Finance. Appearing before the House Capital In\u00ad vestment Committee Jan. 21, Commissioner Wayne Simoneau said the state is on track to be restored to the top rating by the last of the three major bond rating firms. Simoneau and Gov. Arne Carlson recently met with officials from Standard & Poor's Ratings Group in hopes of seeing the state's AAA bond rating restored. The state currently has a AA-plus rating from Standard & Poor's. The other major rating firms, Fitch Investors Service and Moody's Investor Service, both give Minne\u00ad sota the AAA rating. A better rating means lower interest on the general obligation bonds Minnesota sells to finance building projects throughout the state. Last year, the governor signed a bill authorizing $485.3 million in public build\u00ad ing and repair projects to be paid for with bond revenues. Minnesota lost its AAA rating from Stan\u00ad dard & Poor's in March 1982 and lost its top rating from Moody's in April 1982. Both 4 SESSION WEEKLY I January 24, 1997 rating firms downgraded Minnesota to AA. The state was not rated by Fitch until the late 1980s, when the firm gave Minnesota the AA-plus rating. Fitch upgraded Minne\u00ad sota to AAA in 1993. Moody's boosted the state's rating to AAA in May 1996. Carlson now lists restoration of the AAA rating from Standard & Poor's among his top priorities for the 1998-99 biennium. Simoneau said the Standard & Poor's up\u00ad grade could come as soon as this summer, as long as the Legislature\" does not stray too far from [Carlson's] budget.\" The governor's budget proposal will in\u00ad clude measures that should please analysts at Standard & Poor's, according to Simoneau. For instance, the governor's budget rec\u00ad ommendations will call for an increase in the state budget reserve from the current $260 million to about $500 million, Simoneau said. Peter Sausen, assistant commissioner of finance, told committee members that the rating firm will consider the overall financial management of the state and the state's economy, which has been flourishing. Any new, open-ended spending require\u00ad ments the Legislature creates will count against Minnesota in the effort to receive a bond rating upgrade, Sausen said. Members of the Economic Development Finance Division of the House Economic Development and International Trade Committee stopped to look at a windmill during a tour of the Minnesota History Center Jan. 23. CRIME Prison problems House members getting their first look at revamped plans for a new prison in Rush City, Minn., are concerned that the proposal runs far afield of the 1996 law authorizing construction of the facility. Most inmates would share a cell at a new prison, under the revised plan for the facility presented at a joint meeting of the House Judiciary Finance Division and the Capital Investment Committee Jan. 23. The Department of Corrections originally sought $100 million to build a close-custody facility with six residential sections of 136 cells, providing space for 816 beds. The 1996 Legislature approved a plan to spend $89 million for the new prison. Subsequent cost estimates that predicted a significant overrun prompted the correc\u00ad tions department go back to the drawing board. To stick with plans for six residential sec\u00ad tions would have produced a price tag of roughly $10 million more than was appro\u00ad priated by the Legislature, according to Sally Grans, Rush City project manager. The department is now pitching a plan that calls for four housing sections, with three of them double-bunked. The new plan would provide 952 beds. \"We are trying to be responsive to the pressure I think we're all feeling to try to do more with less,\" sa.id Dennis Benson, deputy commissioner forthe department.\" ... We're here today with our hat in our hand to try to get this thing built to deal with our [inmate] population problem.\" Proponents of double-bunking succeeded in getting a provision into the 1996 law au\u00ad thorizing the development of an alternate plan including double-bunking in one of the so-call pods, or sections, where inmates will be housed. But concerns are surfacing now about the extent of double-bunking called for in the revamped prison plan. \"It doesn't say, 'at least one pod.\"' Rep. Loren Solberg (D FL-Bovey). \"Clearly the law has to be changed before this can go ahead.\" Benson tried to allay concerns about the large number of inmates who would be shar\u00ad ing cells. He described the state's experience with double-bunking at medium-security facilities and detailed the factors considered~ when selecting inmates for shared cells. David Crist, left, and Dennis Benson, both from the Department of Corrections, present revamped design plans for a new state prison to be built in Rush City, Minn. The officials met with members of the House Capital Investment Committee and the Judiciary Finance Division Jan. 23. Double-bunking is opposed by some who contend that it poses an increased risk to the safety of staff and inmates. \"This is a calculated risk business,\" Benson said. \"We have a program that we think will address those kinds of concerns, and we're prepared to move ahead with it.\" The Department of Corrections also is seeking a change in state law to allow double\u00ad bunking in the higher security prisons. Cur\u00ad rently, double-bunking is allowed for up to half the population at medium-security fa\u00ad cilities, such as Faribault, Lino Lakes, and Moose Lake. The department wants to create a six-level custody system that uses numbers to indi\u00ad cate the level of security, one being the mini\u00ad mum and six being the maximum. Double\u00ad bunking would be allowed at level four and under. Oak Park Heights, now considered maxi\u00ad mum-security, would be level six. Stillwater and St. Cloud, both classified as close-cus\u00ad tody facilities, would be level five. Rush City would be level 4. Double-bunking would not be allowed at Oak Park Heights, Stillwater, and St. Cloud because of the age of those facilities and the size of the cells. Cells at Rush City are planned at 84.2 square feet. St. Cloud,s cells are only 48 square feet, and Stillwater's are 60 square feet. Benson said the new Rush City proposal has improved recreational and industrial space, providing for more programs impor\u00ad tant to controlling the inmate population. \"Virtually the only time we,re going to have two people in the same cell is during sleeping hours,\" Benson said. Still, not all members of the joint panel seemed ready to endorse the department's plan. Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) ar\u00ad gued that Minnesota should not join other states in\" a mood that is dangerous,\" whereby inmates are treated \"like animals.\" \"I am concerned about double-bunking, and, frankly, I don't give a damn what other states are doing,\" he said. Further discussion on the prison is ex\u00ad pected at a later date this session. EDUCATION Removing the caps The House Taxes Committee unanimously approved legislation Jan. 23 that would re\u00ad move statutory caps now in place on K-12 education funding. The caps, passed during a special session in 1995 and effective with the start of the 1998-99 biennium, would effectively cut education funding by $337 million, prima\u00ad rily by reducing the per-pupil amount each school district receives from the state. Other reductions would alter the formula used by the state to calculate funding levels for sec\u00ad ondary students. Much -at times heated -discussion focused not on the removal of the caps, a move which has broad bipartisan support, but on an amendment to HFI to alter the complex formula thatdetermineshowmuch money each school district receives. The goal of the amendment, offered by Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), was to hold the line on property taxes in those districts with excess levy referendums or high property taxes in place as a result of the caps. It was rejected on an 18-5 vote. Many committee members agreed with Abrams' idea in principle, but said HFI was not the place to put it. \"I believe this [amendment] will endan\u00ad ger the passage of this legislation,\" bill spon\u00ad sor Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park) said. \"The leadership has called for a clean bill.\" Others said such tinkering could lead to similar tactics in the Senate, which could ultimately derail the legislation. It would be better to wait for the House's omnibus K-12 education or tax bills to make such a change, Johnson said. Abrams, though, remained adamant that his amendment be adopted, and said that the future funding-formula changes might \"slip through the cracks.\" House Majority Leader Ted Winter (DFL\u00ad Fulda) reminded the committee that any changes to the bill would violate the letter, if not the spirit, of the House leadership's vow to present the governor with an unadorned HFI, and could make it harder to pass future legislation, such as welfare or property tax reform. \"Let's vote it down and move on,\" Winter said, calling for a roll-call vote on the amend\u00ad ment. The committee referred HFI to the House Ways and Means Committee. GOVERNMENT Emergency snow removal This winter's severe weather has many Minnesota communities piling up record spending on snow plowing. Especially hard hit is southwestern Minnesota, where most counties and townships have already ex\u00ad hausted their 1997 snow removal budgets. A proposal (HFIOO) sponsored by Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) would ap\u00ad propriate $20 million for those local govern\u00ad ments most affected by winter storms and their aftermath. The bill was approved Jan. 21 by the House Local Government and Metropolitan Affairs Committee. Gov. Arne Carlson expressed support for such a bill in his State of the State address. HFIOO originally asked for $25 million but was amended to match Carlson's $20 mil\u00ad lion proposal and a similar measure (SF87) introduced in the Senate.

The House bill provides that grants can be made to local units of government for: \"snowplowing for emergencies because the snowplowing budget or other resources are January 24, 1997 I SESSION WEEKLY 5 depleted; emergencies due to severe weather and its aftermath, which may include flooding, and which affects or threatens public safety; and required matching funds under 1997 fed\u00ad eral weather-related disaster declarations.\" Grants are divided into three categories by the bill. The commissioner of public safety would be authorized to make grants up to $5,000 to counties, cities, and towns for se\u00ad vere weather-related matters. Grants of up to $10,000 would require the approval of the governor. And for grants of more than $10,000, the governor would have to consult with a legislative advisory commission. State agencies also would be eligible to apply for grants of more than $10,000. \"The winter storm situation has been fast moving and accumulating,\" said Jim Franklin, director of the Department of Pub\u00ad lic Safety's Division of Emergency Manage\u00ad ment. He told committee members thatthere have been seven Presidential declarations of emergency related to weather this winter. \"The bill will allow us to evaluate the emer\u00ad gency requests we receive from local govern\u00ad ments, take into account the federal aid avail\u00ad able, and supplement that where appropri\u00ad ate.\" Wenzel told the committee that Marshall, Minn., has experienced 10 major snow storms in five weeks. \"The size of this prob\u00ad lem puts us ahead of 1993 in precipitation,\" he said, referring to the year Minnesota ex\u00ad perienced extensive spring flooding. \"We are trying to get ahead of this and do some preventive measures.\" Others admitted that the full effects of the storm have not yet been discovered. \"We don't have any hard data on the impact of the storms yet,\" said Joel Jamnik of the League of Minnesota Cities. \"But we are hear\u00ad ing stories daily. There are constant reports of people digging out after being snowed in for several days. We had to issue warnings for snowmobilers to watch out for power lines. And those were not downed lines -they were in snow drifts up to the lines.\" Jim Mulder of the Association of Minne\u00ad sota Counties told the committee that there may be significant long-term damage from the severe winter weather that won't show up right away. \"Continuous snow plowing is really hard on our roads,\" he said. \"And we may see floods this spring like we,ve never seen before.>' Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview) argued that HFlOO should be tabled until a state\u00ad sponsored survey determines the exact ex\u00ad tent of the need. His motion was defeated 14-2. HFlOO now moves to the House Judiciary Committee. 6 SESSION WEEKLY I January 24, 1997 Snowmobiles ... Lawmakers react to snowmobile tragedies A recent string of deadly snowmobile accidents has lawmakers looking for ways to improve safety without diminishing a popular and profitable winter sport. The. Jan. 18-19 weekend saw five snowmobilers and one pedestrian die in snowmobile accidents. The death toll is 24 so. far this season, fast approaching last year's 26 snowmobiling fatalities. Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison) plans to introduce a bill that would set new requirements for snowmobile safety training and provide funds for increased enforcement and trail improvements. \"I want to make this sport safe,\" Peterson said. \"It's a very big industry, and it's something that wasn't there for tourism 10 years ago. That's great for northern Minnesota, but they still want a safe experience.,, Peterson's proposal would require snowmobilers to complete safety train\u00ad ing and receive a special drivee s license endorsement, similar to requirements now in place for motorcycle riders. The measure also would impose a $10 annual surcharge on registration fees for snowmobiles with engines of 335 cubic centimeters or larger. Proceeds from that surcharge, which Peterson estimates would be about $2 million per year, would be used to boost enforcement of safety laws, to improve snowmobile trails, and to support safety training. Peterson also wants a requirement that snowmobilers carry liability insurance. (Currentlawdoesnotrequirethatsnow\u00ad mobiles be insured, nor does it require insurance for boats, personal water craft or all-terrain vehicles.) \"I recognize that it's a small minority who causes most of the accidents,\" Peterson said. \"But we cannot permit unsafe conditions and unsafe operation to continue when the tollinhumanlifeis so high.\" Many of the recent snowmobiling deaths are being attributed to high speeds or alcohol or a mix of both. Most nota\u00ad bly, a 20-year-old Coon Rapids man now faces charges that on Jan. 18 he was driv\u00ad ing his snowmobile drunk when it struck and killed 10-year-old Josh Renken as the boy walked along a road near his Big Lake, Minn., home. \"The bad actors -the ones drinking and traveling at high speeds -need to know that's over,\" Peterson said. \"We're not going to tolerate that recklessness.\" Another lawmaker is taking a differ\u00ad ent approach to reducing alcohol-re\u00ad lated fatalities. involving snowmobiles, boats, or automobiles. Rep. Doug Swenson (R~Forest Lake) is sponsoring a bill (HF62) that would reduce the legal blood-alcohollimit from 0.10 percent to 0.08 percent for drivers of all vehicles. \"I'm doing this for the purpose of trying to save some lives,\" Swenson said. \"Deaths on the road and through the use of recreational vehicles have been a prob\u00ad lem for a long time.\" Swenson said his bill, which was in\u00ad troduced Jan. 16, is part of a Mothers Against Drunk Driving effort on the state and national level to enact tougher drunk driving laws. \"The [snowmobile] fatalities of last weekend are not\u00b7 a\u00b7 new phenomena,\" Swenson said. \"I. am not pleased that these tragedies have occurred, but I am pleased that they have increased public awareness and legislative interest in this . )) issue. There are currently more than 250,000 snowmobiles registered in Minnesota. Restrictions on who can operate a snow\u00ad mobile are mostly limited to children under age 18. Current law allows a child of any age to drive a snowmobile on private land as long as they are accompanied by an adult. Children 12 to 14 who complete a safety course can operate a snowmobile alone on private land. Children 14 and up who complete a safety course are unrestricted in their snowmobile travels. State law sets a 50 mph speed limit for snowmobilers on public lands or lakes. Snowmobilers traveling in ditches on county roads must adhere to the speed limit on the adjacent road. \"If you're driving 55 to 65 on the highway and you can't keep up with the snowmobiles in the ditch, then you've got a problem,\" Peterson said. -Nick Healy 1997 Budget Address ... r Gov. Arne Carlson doesn't promise a chicken in every pot in his biennial budget proposal, but he does want an computer in ev\u00ad ery classroom. That provision is a small part of the $20.3 billion in state spending the governor is asking for in the 1998-99 spend\u00ad ing cycle, a $1.5 billion increase over the current biennium. Carlson said that his budget pro\u00ad posal will allow the state to achieve long-term fiscal stability, restore its AAA bond rating, and hold down the growth in state spend\u00ad ing. \"A budget is usually seen as being about spending. But it is about much more than that,\" Carlson told a roomful of report\u00ad ers, legislators, and onlookers Jan. 23 at the St. Paul World Trade Center. \"We've worked over the last six years to bring Minnesota from a $1.8 billion budget deficit to a $1.4 billion surplus. This budget builds on that and reflects our priorities for bringing Min\u00ad nesota into the 21st century.\" Cl I The largest single item in the budget proposal is education. The governor calls for an in\u00ad crease of $673 million, or 11.5 percent, in total education spending over the previous bi\u00ad ennium. Several of the governor's edu\u00ad cation reform ideas appear as budget initiatives. He asks for $5 million to establish statewide testing for students in third, fifth, and eighth grade so that par\u00ad ents, school districts, and state officials could judge how well individual schools are perform\u00ad ing. The governor proposes ex\u00ad panding the state's current edu\u00ad cation expense tax deduction by $150 million to allow parents to receive tax credits for private school tuition, tutoring, sum\u00ad mer school enrichment pro\u00ad grams, home schooling ex\u00ad penses, and computer hardware and software purchases. A $30 million initiative called EdVest would also allow families to es\u00ad tablish tax-free savings accounts for higher education. In response to the governor's budget proposal, House Speaker Phil Carruthers and Majority Leader Ted Winter said there are many items that DFLers can sup\u00ad port, although his proposals on House Speaker Phil Carruthers, right, took notes as Majority Leader Ted Winter, center, and Minority Leader Steve Sviggum, left, listened to Gov. Arne Carlson's state budget address Jan. 23 at the World Trade Center in St. Paul. The budget seeks $216 mil\u00ad lion for technology development including a specific initiative to link every public school to the education and property taxes are a ca~se for concern. Carlson's administration forecasts a bud\u00ad get surplus of $1.4 billion for the coming biennium. Based on this prediction, the gov\u00ad ernor wants to give taxpayers a one-time income tax rebate of $261 million. Indi\u00ad vidual taxpayers would receive rebates of $50 to $248. He also proposes $180 million in education tax credits and savings incen\u00ad tives, and $94 million in business and other tax reductions to come out of the surplus. Department of Finance Commissioner Wayne Simoneau noted that for the first time in 20 years, this budget achieves a struc\u00ad tural balance. Spending for 1998-99 is pro\u00ad jected to be less than the rate of growth in Minnesota's personal income. \"In layman's terms, government should not grow at a rate faster than the taxpayer's ability to pay,\" he said. The governor also wants to use $261 mil-lion of the remaining unallocated surplus to double the state's budget reserve to an amount equal to 5 percent of the total bud\u00ad get. The reserve is used to prevent disruption of services or forced tax increases as a result of unanticipated revenue shortfalls. (The proposal currently pending in the Legisla\u00ad ture (HFlOO) for $20 million in emergency relief to communities impacted by this winter's severe storms would come from this fund.) Carlson said that Standard & Poor's, a major financial rating agency, will upgrade Minnesota's bond rating if the Legislature adopts his budget parameters. (See related story, page 4.) In 1982, Minnesota's AAA credit rating was downgraded as a result of the state's fiscal difficulties. Since then, res\u00ad toration of the state's financial condition has led two major rating agencies, Fitch Inves\u00ad tors Service and Moody's Investor Service, to restore Minnesota's AAA bond rating. Internet and increase the num\u00ad ber of computers in classrooms. \"We want every child to have access to computers and technology, just as we had access to text\u00ad books,\" Carlson said. Higher education also comes in for a sub\u00ad stantial $215 million increase in funding. $132 million would go to the University of Minnesota and $83 million to the Minnesota State Colleges and University system. Other highlights of the governor's 1998- 99 budget proposal include: A comprehensive restructuring of state welfare programs in response to the fed\u00ad eral government's elimination of Aid for Families with Dependent Children (AFDC). The major element in the governor's plan is the statewide imple\u00ad mentation of the Minnesota Family In\u00ad vestment Program, a pilot program which ensures that work is rewarded. The budget also calls for a $90 million increase in child care services, considered a key element in January 24, 1997 I SESSION WEEKLY 7 allowing parents currently receiving AFDC to go to work. (See related story, page XX.) $3.4 billion for transportation including the largest road construction program in state history. $890 million would go for state highway construction, $10 million for metropolitan transit, and $3 million for outstate Minnesota transit. $880 million, a 13 percent increase, is pro\u00ad posed for environmental and recreation programs including $25 million to double ethanol fuel production subsidies, $2.1 million for grooming and maintenance of local and state snowmobile trails and $7.8 million for continuation of the Motor Vehicle Transfer fee for S uperfund clean up activities. A mere $26,942 increase in state aids and credits to local government. 'TH be blunt,\" Carlson said. \"The formula for local aid is not equitable. Some local governments are getting 70-90 percent of their budgets from the state. That's like going to a res\u00ad taurant, ordering a meal and sending the bill to another table.\" The DFL leadership in the House of Rep\u00ad resentative agreed with some of the governor's proposals. \"We strongly support welfare reform with an orientation on work,'' said House Speaker Carruthers (DFL-Brook\u00ad lyn Center). \"We also applaud his increase in higher education funding and efforts to con\u00ad trol growth in spending by state agencies.\" Carruthers expressed concern that the governor's budget \"offers little real increase for K-12 education and virtually freezes prop\u00ad erty tax relief. There is almost no increase in the general school aid formula.\" Much of the governor's proposed increase in education funding really represents resto\u00ad ration of $337 million in cuts in state aid, Carruthers noted. Another $180 million is taken up by the Governor's proposed tax credits and deductions for private schools, summer camps and private computers, he added. \"It's a mixed message,\" Carruthers said. \"We support a lot of what he's doing -but we want to strongly support education and job training. The best place we can put education dollars is the general per-pupil aid formula. At the same time, we recognize problems in schools cannot be addressed by dollars alone, but also requires accountabil\u00ad ity for the use of the tax dollar.\" Winter (DFL-Fulda) said rural residents will likely be disappointed that the governor continues to stress income tax relief when rising property taxes are a much more ur\u00ad gent problem. \"He's proposing a one-time income tax giveaway when we really need property tax relief,\" Winter said. Carruthers said House DFLers look for\u00ad ward to getting more precise details on the governor's budget next week. That will start the legislative budget making process, in\u00ad cluding multiple public hearings. \"I look forward to working with the gov\u00ad ernor on the budget,\" Carruthers said. \"That will be the key to a successful and smooth legislative session.'' -Steve Compton Administrator for the House Judiciary Committee Greg Bergstrom, left, and Rep.

The situation is so bad that in Feb\u00ad ruary 1996, President Ernesto Zedillo ordered all his ministers to stop paying journalists for favor\u00ad able coverage. Such practices fly in the face of Minnesota's proud reputation as a good government state. But history shows that not all local scribes were committed to reporting all the news from the statehouse that was fit to print. At least one appears to have received state dollars to color his prose. In 1907, H. E. Samuelson was hired to serve as the House press gallery sergeant for the 1907 and 1909 legislative sessions. For hisser\u00ad vices, he drew a modest paycheck of $5 per day. In current dollars, that's more than a $24,000 annual salary. Trouble was no press gallery ex\u00ad isted, \"and Mr. Samuelson did no work of any kind in connection with that position, except draw his sal\u00ad ary,\" an outraged CarlJ. Buell wrote in his text TheMinnesotaLegislature of 1909. In fact, Samuelson was employed as a political reporter for the St. Paul Pioneer Press and specifically cov\u00ad ered House activities for the news\u00ad paper during his tenure as press gal\u00ad lery sergeant. \"I think it is only fair to infer that he was given about a thousand dol\u00ad lars of the people's money to color his legislative correspondence,\" Buell wrote. There is no mention of other newspapers or reporters who might have been entangled in a similar kickback scheme, but the problem certainly never grew to be of mod\u00ad ern-day Mexican proportions. Ac\u00ad cording to Forbes magazine, a highly placed Mexican source said that if the payment-for-coverage scam were to stop, \"this loss of revenue may bankrupt some of the local newspapers.\" Welfare changes ... State braces for law ending 'welfare Cindy Selmon of Minne\u00ad apolis knows of people who use their monthly welfare check to buy crack and booze instead of feeding their children. Kathy Munt of Rush City, Minn., knows of schoolmates who got preg\u00ad nant so they could qualify for welfare and not have to work. And Charles Lickteig of Stacy, Minn., knows of a family encouraging a tradition of welfare with each new generation. These attitudes anger all three Minneso\u00ad tans. It's because of abuses like these that the federal government scrapped the longstanding welfare system in August 1996. They, too, are on welfare and may soon lose their safety net. Each will watch the 1997 Min\u00ad nesota Legislature carefully as lawmakers grapple with a new federal law that \"ends welfare as we know it\" -just as President Bill Clinton promised. Welfare recipients know it will affect them; they're just not sure how and when. For now, no one knows. The only certainty is that law\u00ad makers must react to major policy changes and limited dol\u00ad lars coming from the federal gov\u00ad ernment. Debate on legislation outlining Minnesota's response to the tougher welfare restric\u00ad tions is expected later this month. The federallawdoes away with monthly welfare checks and food stamps for many legal immi\u00ad grants and eliminates disability cash assistance for people with drug and alcohol addictions. It also eliminates cash assistance for children with certain behav\u00ad ioral disabilities and requires able-bodied adults, ages 18-50, who receive food stamps to work. will be penalized by the federal government. While the federal law prescribes much of what states are required to do, it leaves each state to decide how to design its own welfare system. For their part, states will decide who q uali\u00ad fies for welfare, what the income limits will be, how much cash assistance to dole out, and whether to spend state dollars to help legal immigrants and others whose benefits have been cut off by the federal law. Minnesota, like all states, faces several challenges, most of which will cost money: creating jobs that pay a livable wage and match the skills of people on welfare; expanding job training programs; we know it' locating and paying for child care for all those welfare families now required to work; and creating a safety net for children in families whose parents refuse or can't find work, or whose welfare benefits run out. The welfare alphabet Unlike the old system, poor families no longer have a guarantee or entitlement to welfare. Specifically, Aid to Families with Depen\u00ad dent Children (AFDC) has been eliminated and replaced with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which will send a block grant to each state. In all, the federal government will spend more than $16 billion annually over the next six years. Minnesota expects to receive about $268 million each year, which is about $44 million more per year than it currently re\u00ad ceive~. The federal money, however, comes with tough restrictions on who can receive the cash and for how long. Under the new rules, families receiving monthly welfare checks must find work within two years and there is a five-year lifetime limit on receiv\u00ad ing help. States have the option of paying for more assistance after five years, but the dollars must come out of the state's own coffers. States also have the option of limiting public assistance to fewer than five years and could deny benefits to children born or conceived while the parent is on welfare. It is unclear what Minnesota lawmakers will do. Perhaps the most significant change involves poor families with children. The law requires these parents to get a job and sets a five-year-lifetime limit on their welfare benefits. States that do not get these parents to work Cindy Selmon, a Minneapolis mother on welfare worries that a new federal welfare law may force her to work instead of finish her nursing degree. Pictured from left to right are Selmon's three children: Brandy, 7; Jennifer, 5; and Johnathan, 8. Currently, a typical AFDC family in Minnesota-a mother with one child -receives $43 7 per month on AFDC. A mother with two children receives $532 per month. The monthly benefit has not changed since 1986. An estimated 160,000 people ( 108,000 of whom are children) receive AFDC benefits each month. It's important to note, January 24, 1997 I SESSION WEEKLY 9 1 11 I I however, that more than 50 percent of the families who receive AFDC leave the pro\u00ad gram on their own in two years and do not return, according to Deborah Huskins, an assistant commissioner with the Department of Human Services. The clock on the new federal five-year limit begins ticking when the state submits its plan to the federal government detailing how it will meet the new welfare restrictions and move folks into the job market. States have until July l, 1997, to submit their plans. There are stiff cash penalties -in the form of reductions to a state's block grant -for failing to meet the deadline. Currently, 13 percent of Minnesota's 52,000 AFDC families have been on welfare steadily for the past five years, according to the Department of Human Services. States are under a great deal of pressure to move people off the welfare rolls. Beginning with fiscal year 1997, each state must show that 25 percent of families on welfare are working at least 20 hours per week. By fiscal year 2002, the requirement jumps to 50 per\u00ad cent working at least 30 hours per week. There are cash penalties for states that do not meet the percentages. \"Some of the women just don't believe its going to happen. They don't believe the cuts are real. They figure the federal government will step in when the five-year limit hits,\" said Lynn Shellenberger who runs a Twin Cities project called Sister to Sister, a mentoring program that brings together AFDC mothers and those previously on wel\u00ad fare. If the new law is to work, said Shellenberger, a former welfare mom her\u00ad self, government and the private sector need to come up with several million more dollars for job training and child care. According to the Minnesota Department of Economic Security, the state has plenty of jobs available for welfare families joining the ranks of the employed. But, that news makes social workers shake their heads. The avail\u00ad ability of jobs is only part of the problem. People on welfare need to be trained to take those jobs and too many of them don't pay a livable wage to support a family. Currently, Minnesota pays about $28 mil\u00ad lion per year specifically to train and find work for people on welfare, according to the Department of Human Services. It is unclear if, or by how much, that will increase under \"People think everyone on welfare is just sitting at home and watching soaps, but we're not. ... I know I'm going to get off this stuff.\" -Cindy Selmon, welfare recipient In Minnesota's case, however, state offi\u00ad cials may get a break. Instead of moving 25 percent off the welfare rolls to work in the first year, officials here may only need to worry about 20 percent. That's because the state has seen a drop in welfare cases in recent years, and the federal government is willing to reward Minnesota for it. Currently, about 13 percent of Minnesota AFDC families (6,800 cases) work but it is unclear if they work enough hours to meet the first-year, 20-hours-per-week require\u00ad ment. Assuming they all do -which, offi\u00ad cials warn is unlikely- another 6,200 cases would need to find work in the first year. Reality check The new work requirements have caused anxiety in some and disbelief in others. Some AFDC families are frantic, especially those who can't afford child care and those in school studying for a career. Others don't think the federal law is real. 10 SESSION WEEKLY I January 24, 1997 the 1998-1999 budget. Gov. Arne Carlson has called for a new $4 million program to provide an educational \"pathway\" to help people move from welfare to work. In addition to job training, child care pre\u00ad sents a big obstacle for many welfare families trying to find work. Ninety percent of Minnesota's welfare recipients are single parents. Minnesota is expected to spend $82 mil\u00ad lion during the 1996-1997 budgeting period on subsidized child care for both welfare parents and the working poor. Waiting lis.ts for subsidized child care slots are long and will grow as thousands of families move into the job market. Some estimates suggest Minnesota will need to double the amount it spends on subsidized child care. The governor has pro\u00ad posed a $90 million increase over the next two years. Minnesota currently subsidizes child care for 15,300 welfare children and some 17,000 children whose parents are considered work\u00ad ing poor -low-income but not on public assistance, said Barbara Yates, an assistant commissioner with the Department of Chil\u00ad dren, Families and Learning. The bottom line on child care, Yates said, is \"we have some and we need more.\" She stressed that child care slots must be created in the evenings, on weekends, and during odd night shifts because that is when some welfare parents will find work. Another unanswered question is whether the state will continue to provide child care to welfare parents who attend school instead of work. It is unclear if they will be able to continue their education or be forced to work. \"Child care is a main concern,\" said Tabitha Carlson, a 25-year-old mother of two who relies on welfare to pay for child care while she studies social work at the University of St. Thomas. \"Under the new law, there could be a penalty for choosing to stay in school rather than going to work right away,\" she said. That penalty could be no more subsidized child care. But, Carlson said, she's got to find a way to finish no matter what obstacles the federal law throws at her. \"I have a vision for myself and this (new law) is not going to stop me.\" Cindy Selmon, a welfare mom from Min\u00ad neapolis, is studying to be a nurse at Minne\u00ad apolis Community College and is juggling her three kids with her classes and a work study job. With a year of study remaining before graduation, she's worried the state will make her quit school and find a job. \"I gotta finish school or my family has little hope .... The more I try, it seems the harder they make it for me,\" she said, wish\u00ad ing the welfare system would judge cases on an individual basis. \"People think everyone on welfare is just sitting at home and watching soaps, but we're not. ... I know I'm going to get off this stuff,\" she said. Selmon, like many on welfare, wishes she just knew what was going to happen. \"I need to know something. I need to know how to prepare.\" Immigrants In all, the federal welfare law is expected to save the United States more than $50 billion over the next six years and much of that savings- $25 billion -targets one group of people. Nationwide, more than two million legal immigrants use one of several welfare pro\u00ad grams. Under the law, however, virtually all public assistance is eliminated. Again, states are free to extend welfare to those legal im\u00ad migrants scheduled to be cut off, but the state must use its own money. Minnesota is home to immigrants from all over the globe. The top five countries of origin are: Laos, Vietnam, Korea, the former Soviet Union, and Mexico. Currently, 34,000 of the roughly 100,000 legal immigrants in Minnesota receive benefits from one pro\u00ad gram or another. The food stamp program tops the list of federal welfare programs that are now offlim\u00ad its to many legal immigrants. In Minnesota, an estimated 16,000 noncitizens will lose their food stamps in 1997. The average person re\u00ad ceives $63 per month in food coupons. Also, many elderly and disabled immi\u00ad grants will lose their Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a federal program begun in 197 4 that provides cash help (an average of $378 a month) to the needy who are aged, blind, or disabled. In Minnesota, 5,400 im\u00ad migrants are expected to lose their SSI in August 1997. Thefe are some exceptions to the food stamp and SSI bans. For instance, legal im\u00ad migrants who have worked 10 years in the United States will keep their benefits. New refugees also will be eligible for food stamps and SSI, but only for their first five years in the U.S. In contrast, refugees who have lived in this country for five years or more will lose the benefits. In terms of the federal block grant that replaces AFDC, immigrant families with children who arrived after Aug. 22, 1996, (the day the federal law was signed), are now barred for five years from receiving any cash help. It is up to each state to determine whether immigrants already on U.S. soil at the time the law was signed should receive the benefit. If Minnesota decides they should, the law requires that the income of the immigrant's American sponsor be consid\u00ad ered when determining eligibility. The law also gives states the option of denying Medicaid coverage (known as Medi\u00ad cal Assistance in Minnesota) to legal non:\u00ad citizens even if they were in the country prior to the federal law being signed. Medical As\u00ad sistance is a joint federal and state program that helps people who can't afford health care. New immigrants will automatically be barred from receiving Medical Assistance for five years after entry into the United States. Certain emergency help will remain avail\u00ad able for all immigrants -legal or otherwise -such as emergency hospital care, disaster relief, the national school lunch program, public health immunizations, soup kitch-Steve Jacobson of St. Paul has a cup of coffee as he waits for lunch at the Dorothy Day Center soup kitchen in downtown St. Paul. Jacobson, who says he has been in and out of mental institutions, wonders how he'll survive without his monthly public assistance check. ens, higher education, and Head Start for disadvantaged pre-schoolers. Despite the fact that federal benefits are being taken from immigrants, there's no \"mad rush\" to become a U.S. citizen, said John Borden, a casework supervisor with the International Institute of Minnesota, a St. Paulcenterthat offers U.S. citizenship classes. The institute has scheduled additional citi\u00ad zenship classes anticipating a demand. But the expected rush hasn't materialized. \"They . aren't going to start coming until they start seeing that the pinches are real,\" Borden said. He expects the state to soften the cuts somewhat but not nearly enough to replace the federal dollars. \"There's going to be an awful lot of suffering for some people.\" Program hopping Folks cut off from federal welfare may now qualify for one of several state pro\u00ad grams, but the state must find ways to pay for the increased demand. In Minnesota, two state programs offer help to those in poverty who do not qualify for Medical Assistance or Supplemental Se\u00ad curity Income. General Assistance offers about $203 a month to those who are ineligible for other welfare programs. General Assistance Medi\u00ad cal Care pays for necessary health care for those who are ineligible for other medical assistance programs. The state has no program to replace the cuts in food stamps but has the option of creating one. \"I hope the state will step in or I don't know what these people are going to do,\" said William Yang of the Hmong-American Partnership in St. Paul. Yang worries about his parents, who now receive public assistance. His family came to this country 16 years ago and although he became a citizen, his parents did not. His father is 85-years-old and his mother is 72- years-old. They don't understand the En\u00ad glish language well enough to pass the citi\u00ad zenship test. \"Many people are like my mom and dad. It's impossible to teach the elderly the lan\u00ad guage so they can become citizens. It's easier to teach a water buffalo the flute,\" Yang said. \"It's unfair. This is their home now. Their bones will be buried here.\" But not everyone sympathizes with Minnesota's immigrants. The cuts to legal immigrants are a fine start according to Jim Culotta, a government relations associate with the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The Wash\u00ad ington, D.C.-based group seeks to limit im\u00ad migration into the United States. Immigrants, Culotta said, are using wel\u00ad fare disproportionately. \"Why would we want to bring more people here when they can't support themselves? We can continue to take in the world's poor, but it is only going to work against our own country,\" he said. \"We have plenty of poor Americans here already and we're not doing an ad\u00ad equate enough job of supporting them.\" Those who sponsor immigrants to come to the United States, Culotta said, should be responsible for assuming the costs of all of their needs. Other SSI changes Legal immigrants aren't the only people facing the loss of their SSI checks. Until Jan. 1, 1997, some 2,800 Minnesotans with drug and alcohol addictions also were considered to have a \"disability\" and qualified for a monthly $470 check. The federal law cut them off and some cities and counties are bracing for an in\u00ad crease in homelessness, crime, and emer\u00ad gency room visits. \"These are the people who are going to turn the streets of downtown Minneapolis January 24, 1997 I SESSION WEEKLY 11 MFIP pilot program For several years Minnesota has ex\u00ad perimented with a welfare pilot program in eight counties that requires poor fami\u00ad lies to work if they want public assis\u00ad tance. If Gov. Arne Carlson and many state officials have their way, that experiment will become permanent and spread to all 87 Minnesota counties. The Minnesota Family Investment Plan (MFIP) is expected to become the state,s answer to a tough new federal welfare law. Under the MFIP plan parents would leave welfare when their income reaches 120 percent of the poverty level which, for a family of three, is about $15,600. Under Minnesota's traditional wel\u00ad fare program, a family leaves welfare when its income reaches 85 percent of the poverty level. That, agency officials say, too often has discouraged people on welfare from even bothering to get a job. Families who worked typically lost in\u00ad come because earnings were deducted from their welfare check. MFIP allows families to accept lower paying jobs while receiving some public assis\u00ad tance, such as ex\u00ad tra monthly cash and subsidized child and health care. In theory, al\u00ad lowing someone to work while still receiving benefits helps a low-skilled parent gain work Some 300 legislators, welfare recipients, case workers, and state agency officials met together Jan. 22 at the Radisson Hotel St. Paul to figure out how to reshape Minnesota's welfare program in light of a new federal welfare law that cuts benefits to many and requires most others to work. State Demographer Tom Gillaspy presented a statistical breakdown of Minnesotans on welfare. Under MFIP, going to work increases a family's income. For example, a parent with one child who would receive a com\u00ad bined cash-food stamp grant of $638 per month without work- experience and eventually obtain a bet\u00ad ter job. Under the proposal, two-parent fami\u00ad lies statewide would be required to work immediately to receive welfare benefits. Single-parent families would be required to work within six months of receiving assistance. Parents who don't work will have their welfare benefits cut by 25 to 35 percent. Also, in keeping with the federal law, there will be a five-year lifetime limit on receiving benefits. and St. Paul into the streets of down town Los Angeles,\" said Allison Boisvert of Catholic Charities Exodus Division. \"These people are mentally ill, not just chemically dependent. ...

MFIP began in 1994 as a pilot project in seven counties -Anoka, Dakota, Hennepin, Mille Lacs, Morrison, Sherburne and Todd. Ramsey County was added in July 1996. About 4,500 families receive welfare under MFIP and preliminary study re\u00ad sults suggest that those people are more likely to work than those under the old welfare system. the group cut off from SSI benefits. Some 3,200 children with behavioral disorders are expected to lose their checks after July 1997 due to a more narrow definition of \"disabil\u00ad ity.\" Their average monthly benefit is $406. Food stamps The federal food stamp program was also changed by Congress. Able-bodied adults ages 18 to 50 with no children will no longer receive food stamps unless they are working. This provision could affect some 3,400 Minnesotans who currently receive about $65 in food coupons per month. Under the federallaw, adults without chil\u00ad dren can only receive food stamps for three months in a three-year period unless they are working. \"Work\" can include participat\u00ad ing in a government work program 20 hours or more per week. \"I realize they had to do something about welfare fraud, but this law is blanket cover\u00ad age and people are going to get buried under it,\" said Charles Lickteig of Stacy, Minn., who has been on food stamps for about two months. \"If you look three years down the road, there's no telling what can happen to a per\u00ad son,\" said Lickteig, who was hospitalized last fall after an accident. He doesn't plan on being on food stamps long. He's studying to become a certified welder and hopes he can soon pass out ofhis program at Southwestern Technical College before his food stamps run out. \"Sure, there are people happy sitting on welfare and they do nothing to get off, but there are lots of people who use it only when they need it, when there's trouble,\" he said. \"I just want to go back to a regular life .... Just the [food stamp] paperwork alone kills me.\" The welfare debate in Minnesota is ex\u00ad pected to heat up quickly during the 1997 Legislative Session. Officials with the De\u00ad partment of Human Services say they need a state welfare law signed by March 31, 1997 or they run the risk of missing the federal sum\u00ad mer deadline to submit state plans. Missing the deadline means cash penal\u00ad ties. And, with as many poor families expect\u00ad ing the state to pitch in where federal dollars leave off, Minnesota can't afford to be fined. -K. Darcy Hanzlik At precisely 11:36 a.m. in a Jan. 23 meet\u00ad ing of the House Taxes Committee, Rep. DanMcElroy (R-Burnsville) pointed out that in the heavens above, four planets had just come into alignment with a full moon - a situation that occurs only once every 200 years or so. If one makes a wish under such a circumstance, McElroy said, supposedly that wish will be granted, although he was quick to add that he professes no great belief in the pseudoscience of astrology. I \"You may wish for whatever you want,\" McElroy told the committee, \"but I'm wish\u00ad ing for property tax reform.'' House Minority Leader. Sviggum: Rep. Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) makes the transitions between meetings, interviews, and major press conferences look effortless. Maybe that's because the 1997 session is his 19th as a legislator and his fifth as House minority leader. While serving in office is nothing new to him, he's still enamored with the job. \"Outside of my family, being a mem\u00ad ber of the Legislature is the best thing I've ever done in my life,\" he said. In addition, he said, he still feels chal\u00ad lenged by the start of a new ses\u00ad sion. \"Working with people means always being in a state of learning. Each session means be\u00ad ginning anew. It means dealing with peoples' attitudes and feel\u00ad ings and with new relationships. I always work to stay aware and keep doors open.\" I t natural for there to be optimism at the be\u00ad ginning of the session. As the session goes forward, maybe some optimism will give way to reality,\" he said. If Sviggum's outlook is tempered, it may be due to his unbending political philoso\u00ad phy. 'Tm conservative. I'm not a moderate,\" he said. ''I'm very traditional in my feelings and values.\" He believes a more conservative viewpoint is a natural outgrowth of matu\u00ad rity. \"Maybe you've heard the idea that at 20, I h politics was never very deep. \"My farming background influenced me tremendously. It gave me my values and principles; namely hard work, honesty, self-reliance, and indi\u00ad vidual responsibility.\" Sviggum and his two brothers farm the same 1,000 acres near Kenyon, Minn., that his family has culti\u00ad vated for 100 years. Today, they grow soy\u00ad beans and corn and raise beef cattle. \"One of my favorite pastimes is riding the tractor through the fields. It's very calming,\" he said. \"I also enjoy heading out to the basketball court at night with the kids, just the four of us.\" Sviggum has three chil\u00ad dren: 12. \"The biggest accom\u00ad plishment of my life is having three lovely, good children, with good values and principals.\" How did he do that? \"I have a good wife,\" he said with a grin. Debbie Sviggum teaches high school in Cannon Falls, Minn. Sviggum also continues his long-standing activities as a bas\u00ad ketball coach and referee. He counts among his great\u00ad est legislative victories the bi\u00ad partisan passage of a workers' compensation bill in 1995. \"It helped Minnesota become com\u00ad petitive for jobs,\" he said. His biggest disappointment? \"Not gathering a majority this ses\u00ad sion.\" That rates with another one: the failure thus far to pass an equitable funding formula for education in which the state would pick up a greater share of the tab, he said. The start of the 1997 Legisla\u00ad tive session is unique in several ways. The Republican party was disappointed in its effort to gain a House majority despite Sviggum's best efforts and surest predictions. He attributes it, in part, to weakness at the top of the Republican ticket during the 1996 presidential election with Bob Dole and U.S. Senate candidate Rudy Boschwitz losing to Demo\u00ad crats. \"If it dential election year, the Repub\u00ad licans would be the majority in the House,\" he said. Still, he added, while the loss came as a blow, the final numbers also re\u00ad veal a Republican victory. \"We're a very close minority at 64-70. It means we'll be real players, espe\u00ad cially when you factor in a Re\u00ad publican governor. Many of our initiatives will be looked upon favorably,\" he said. \"The outcome speaks well to the candidates and the issues. We have 10 new fresh\u00adHouse Minority Leader Steve Sviggum in his 19th session as a lawmaker is still enamored with the job. At least there will always be lutefisk. Sviggum, who said he's proud of his traditionalism, is also proud to be a connoisseur oflutefisk- cod soaked in lye. \"I like it -love it,\" he said. men, and they'll be good, solid legislators.\" Also new is the apparent goodwill be\u00ad tween political parties. \"I genuinely feel that there is going to be a bipartisan effort to attend to the peoples' business. Hopefully, we'll focus on policy rather than power poli\u00ad tics,\" Sviggum said. Still, he's a pragmatist. \"Maybe it's just one's politics should come from the heart, but at 40, they should come from the head.\" At age 20, whether from the heart or head, Sviggum's politics took on a considerably different tone. He cast his first presidential vote for Democrat George McGovern, and joined thousands of others in protesting the Vietnam War. But his immersion in liberal \"The church [Vang Lutheran] puts on a big lutefisk dinner every year, and we also eat it at home. But you have to develop a taste for it.\" Do the kids eat it? \"No. I didn't at their age either. But they will-that's tradition!\" -Celeste Riley January 24, 1997 I SESSION WEEKLY 13 1997-98 Minnesota House of Representatives Agriculture 487 State Office Building ............. 296-4247 Meets: Mon.) 10 a.m. Legislative Assistant Vacant ...........................................

Marx ........................... 296-7176 Even those audited by the state come away as satisfied customers, members of the House Governmental Operations Committee's State Government Finance Division were told at a meeting in mid-January. There, the Department of Revenue's Deputy Commis\u00ad sioner Mathew Smith reported that of the 500 or so taxpayers who had been audited during 1996 and responded to a customer\u00ad satisfaction survey, 92 percent had been \"sat\u00ad isfied with the audit process.\" Smith then told the committee it costs the state a mere 60 cents or so to collect $100 worth of sales tax -far less than the cost to collect the same amount of either individual or corporate franchise levies. \"As a small-business owner who is cur\u00ad rently undergoing a sales-tax audit, I can tell you why it costs you less,\" Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-.Shoreview), the division's lead Republi\u00ad can, said sternly. \"Because the business own\u00ad ers collect it for you.\" \"Well, 92 percent of you should be satis\u00ad fied with that,\" piped up Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls). Assignments as of 1/23/97 \"Rooms in State Office Building \"\"exofficio -non-voting member New members ... n stays Rep. Doug Stang (R-Cold Spring) is used to questions about his age. He heard them on the campaign trail, and he's hearing them in his early days as a member of the House. Rep. Doug Stang The 22-year-old is the youngest member of the 1997 Legislature, but it's a distinction he seems to pay little mind. \"Someone has to be youngest, and I guess I'm that person,\" he said. \"In my district, this is really nothing un\u00ad usual. Our area has a history of sending young legislators down here to St. Paul.\" In fact, the region around Stang's home\u00ad town has elected several relatively youthful state lawmakers. District l 4B also claims the youngest member of the Minnesota.Senate, Sen. Michelle Fischbach (R-Paynesville), 31. A recent graduate of St. John's University, Stang's political education got a boost in 1995 when he served as a clerk for the Senate Agriculture and Rural Development Com\u00ad mittee, then chaired by Sen. Joe Bertram of Paynesville. \"Working in the Senate in 1995 gave me an idea of what exactly it takes to be a legis\u00ad lator and what you need to do,\" Stang said. \"At that point, my interest in running for office grew.\" Stang once stood up at a party for Bertram staffers and joked that he wasn't sure who he might someday unseat, Joe Bertram or his brother Jeff Bertram, then a member of the House. Within a short period of time, Stang made a bid for each of the seats once held by the Bert rams. Lawmakers discussed streaking and got a firsthand look at their subject matterduringoneunusualdayin 1974. The Rochester Post-Bulletin, on March 14, 197 4, reported that law\u00ad makers debated a \"streaking amend\u00ad ment\" to an unrelated bill the previous day and that \"nude male streakers\" made their Capitol complex debut. The tongue-in-cheek amendment, offered by Rep. Neil Haugerud (DFL\u00ad Preston), defined a streaker as \"one who moves at a high speed, but not to ru After Joe Bertram resigned in 1995, Stang declared his candidacy for the Senate seat, but lost in the Republican primary to Fischbach. Stang got another chance at the Legisla\u00ad ture when Jeff Betram announced that he would not seek re-election in 1996. This time Stang had better luck. He defeated Paynesville Mayor Joe Voss in the Novem\u00ad ber general election. Stang built his campaign around his prom\u00ad ise to better mirror his district's values. Those values, according to Stang, center on a strong work ethic and a commitment to family. He also plans to support a fiscally conser\u00ad vative agenda focusing on issues such as continued reform of the welfare system and cautious use of the forecast budget surplus. Stang sees a golden opportunity for the state to make effective welfare system changes in the wake oflast year's federal overhaul. \"There's such a strong public uproar against the current system,\" Stang said. \"Now more than ever we have the public support to make the changes and to shift toward getting people back into the workplace.\" He is taking a cautious approach to any proposal that calls for dipping into the sur\u00ad plus in state funds, which is forecast to reach $1.4 billion. \"I don't like the idea of spending that money,\" Stang said. \"If the additional rev\u00ad enue is there, I would like to see it spent on education if we're going to spend it on any\u00ad thing.\" Improving public education was another theme of Stang's campaign and it is some\u00ad thing he intends to concentrate on as a legis\u00ad lator. He would like to see the state pick up a exceed 55 miles an hour\" - a sarcastic reference to the freshly established 55 mph speed limit. The amendment also called for a $2 registration fee for streakers and a spe\u00ad cial tax on ski masks and sneakers. And the proposal included a requirement that \"night streakers\" be equipped with a light on the front and a red reflector on the rear, according to the Post-Bul\u00ad letin. I cerns larger share of the education spending tab to reduce the current reliance on local property taxes. And Stang has joined a chorus ofleg\u00ad islators calling for repeal of education spend\u00ad ing caps enacted in 199 5 that would result in significant cutbacks over the next two years. He also is among the many lawmakers who are opposed to public funding for a new baseball stadium. \"People love the Twins out in rural areas, but those people understand what their pri\u00ad orities are and the Legislature needs to un\u00ad derstand those priorities as well,\" Stang said. Those down-home priorities seem to be Stang's guiding force in his early days in the House, and he promises that age will not hold him back. \"The main thing is you have to earn the respect of your colleagues,\" Stang said. \"The way you do that is by respecting them and respecting the experience that they have. That's what I've been doing, and that's what I will continue to do.\" -Nick Healy District 14B 1996 population: 36,096 Largest city: Counties: Stearns, Pope Location: central Minnesota Top concern: \"The people who live in my district have a very strong work ethic and they're very family oriented. They want to see those values incorporated into the work we do In the Legisla\u00ad ture. I want to carry those values forward, and I want to give my district honest, open-minded representation.'' -Rep. Doug Stang Lawmakers had some fun with the proposed amendment. One suggested that streakers in the Senate be required to wear a coat and necktie - a jab at the upper body's dress code. The amendment never came up for a vote, but events that followed left some wondering if it should have. Moments after the proposal was dropped, three streakers scurried past the House chamber entrance. January 24, 1997 I SESSION WEEKLY 19 In the Hopper.

Activists, constituents, and lobbyists have converged on the complex to shareinformation and try and help to play a role in legislative decision-making. While such issues as a new stadium for the Minnesota Twins or more money for education are being brought to the table, some of the 134 House members have alreadyintroduced 342 bills that received a first reading. All of these have been sent to Housecommittees for hearings. Only four bills have been sent back to the body and passed.So far, no bills have failed to pass. About 1,500 bills will be introduced by the end ofMay, but only some 300 may go to the governor to be signed into law, and some of themmay be vetoed. Musing on these findings at this point in the session, total numbers are relatively unimportant. But indirectly, they do relate to the reason for the sea of dark businesssuits seen during lunch hour in the cafeterias of the two buildings. Like their colleagues seen near the Capitol rotunda and talking on their cellular phones, the \"business suiters,\" for the most part, are the 450-plus lobbyists who fill thehallways, tunnels, hearing rooms, and members' offices to discuss and advocate fortheir favorite issues, be it health care, tobacco, cities, oil refining, or money for the arts. What the members do with the information they get from the advocates is difficult to discern. While standing or sitting in some most unlikely places, members who arestopped outside a hearing room or in front of the chamber, listen to and question themany people who seek them out. One can only guess at the reason for seeing so manycellular phone types so early in session, and why \"session statistics\" are climbing sorapidly. It is a fact that now, more than ever in the world of clean Minnesota politics, no member or activist would dare be found guilty of ethics violations. Likewise, it isdifficult to find any informational gatherings held at local eating establishmentsoutside the complex. As the early statistics continue to change and become more meaningful, the issues related to them will become more focused. For now, only observing the legislativeplayers is a unique pastime as the legislative caucuses begin a compatible second monthof conducting the business of the people. -LeClair G. Lambert3 January 31, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . Jan. 23 - 30, 1997 Highlights The effort to crack down on the sale of tobacco products to minors, thought to beextinguished in 1996, has flared up againwith the introduction of a new anti-smokingbill. On Jan. 30, members of the Commerce, Tourism and Consumer Affairs Committeevoted 21-4 to send the bill to the House floor. As originally written, HF117 , sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) andKevin Goodno (R-Moorhead), would re-quire local governments to license and regu-late the retail sale of tobacco and conduct atleast two compliance checks per year in ev-ery establishment that sells it. Amendments to the bill cut back the com- pliance checks to one and give cities and towns the option of regulating tobacco sales.But, if they do not, counties would have nochoice. They must. Rest's measure is similar to the amend- ment she offered to a tobacco bill in 1996.But that bill, sponsored by Rep. LorenJennings (DFL-Harris), would have set state-wide penalties for selling tobacco to minors.Jenning's modeled his bill after the so-called\"pre-emption laws\" already on the books inmore than two dozen states that trump localordinances. HF117 , on the other hand, es-Anti-smoking bill . . . Lawmakers work to block tobacco sales to minors tablishes a minimum level of regulation and relies on a framework of local ordinances tomeet, or exceed, the law. Rest told committee members that the legislation has the support of a broad coali-tion of interests, including public healthgroups, law enforcement agencies, andchildren's and family advocates. Moreover,she continued, \"the general public supportsthis legislation by a huge margin.\" Rest called underage smoking the country's \"number one public health problem,\" com-paring it to the ravages of AIDS, highwaydeath, and murder. Indeed, two local offi-cials and two schoolchildren testified to thateffect. One 11-year-old student illustrated the threat. He recounted the ease of strolling into a restaurant and buying a pack of ciga-rettes from a vending machine. The bill, however, was not without oppo- sition. Officials from the Minnesota RetailGrocer's Association and the MinnesotaRetailer's Association testified in oppositionto the legislation. The law, they said, wouldimpose a difficult burden on merchants whooperate stores in several different cities andtowns, each of which could impose a differ-ent level of regulation. \"Most retailers do their own compliancechecks,\" said retail association spokeswoman Judy Cook, \"and most often the clerk mis-judges someone's age rather than commits awillful violation.\" After hearing all public testimony, the committee accepted five amendments. Under an amendment offered by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy), a city, town ortownship would have the option of regulat-ing tobacco sales and could enact regula-tions stronger than those outlined in the bill.If the municipality chose not to regulatetobacco sales, that responsibility would fallto the county, which would then be com-pelled to do so. The city, town, or countywould also be allowed to set the license fee atan amount sufficient to recover, or perhapsexceed, the cost of enforcement. An amendment offered by Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley), reduced the num-ber of mandatory compliance checks fromtwo per year to one. Many committee mem-bers felt that requiring municipalities to per-form two checks, which are usually \"sting\"operations, would impose an undue finan-cial burden on local governments. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville) pro- posed an amendment that would require alocal government to give at least 30 dayswritten notice to retailers before adoptingany ordinance that would change the to-bacco regulations. Rep. Bob Gunther (R-Fairmont) success- fully offered a pair of amendments. The firstdeleted a section that would have prohibitedtobacco manufacturers or distributors frompaying retailers to place tobacco products inspecial eye-catching locations in a store.Many distributors routinely pay shopkeep-ers \"slot\" payments to ensure their productsreceive the most prominent display space. Gunther, who is a grocer, pointed out that, contrary to media reports, the profitmargin on cigarettes is not great. In fact, hesaid, many small store owners have come torely on the slot payments. Gunther's second amendment reduced the amount of fines levied against the store own-ers for violating the law. Originally, the billimposed a minimum $100 fine for a first A bill on its way to the House floor would crack down on the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco productsto minors.4 SESSION WEEKLY / January 31, 1997offense and at least $250 for a second offense. The amounts changed to $50 and $150, re-spectively. Rest's bill retained its $50 fine for store clerks who sell tobacco to a minor. \"The net effect of this bill is that we get a statewide standard . . . and still allow localgovernments to be more strict,\" in theirregulation of tobacco, Rest said. \"This ap-proach to restricting tobacco . . . will be avery important public policy decision forMinnesota.\" \u2014F.J. Gallagher AGRICULTURE Exorbitant milk prices State lawmakers are looking for answers to problems in the dairy industry that haveMinnesota consumers paying exceptionallyhigh milk prices while the state's dairy farm-ers struggle to make a living. \"I believe there is a crisis in the dairy industry today,\" said Rep. Steve Wenzel(DFL-Little Falls), who chairs the HouseAgriculture Committee. \"The crisis is notbeing addressed by those who are profitingfrom it.\" Wenzel's committee and the Senate Agri- culture and Rural Development Committeemet jointly Jan. 24 to discuss the plight ofMinnesota's dairy farmers. The recent history of the dairy business CRIMEShawn Rowley, a sixth grader at Mississippi HeightsMiddle School in Sauk Rapids, Minn., testifiedbefore the Commerce, Tourism and ConsumerAffairs Committee Jan. 30 in favor of a bill thatwould provide for mandatory penalties whentobacco is illegally sold to minors.has been troubled. Farmers have seen a sig-nificant drop in the prices they get for theirproducts. Consumers continue to pay retailprices among the highest in the nation. AndMinnesota's largest milk wholesalers face aninvestigation into price fixing accusations. Frank Grimm, a Sibley County dairy farmer, told members of the joint panel thatchanges must be made to ensure the futureof dairy farming in Minnesota. Grimm's family has been in the dairy busi- ness in Minnesota since the 1800s, but hisoperation is \"losing ground\" because of lowprices paid by processors and rising pricesfor feed and supplies Longtime farmers are being forced out by low prices, and young, start-up farmers justcan't make a go of it, according to Grimm,who spoke on behalf of the Minnesota Farm-ers Union. \"For people to start in this business, we need to have profit,\" he said. \"The way tohave profit is to have fair pricing.\" Wenzel said he plans to pursue reforms this session to help dairy farmers. Specifically, he expressed support for a proposal to repeal the Dairy Unfair TradePractices Law, which prohibits the retail saleof milk at prices below wholesale. Allowing stores to freely set milk prices could drive up consumer demand, and as aresult, force an increase in the price paid todairy farmers, according to Wenzel. \"Minnesota dairy farmers could hardly do worse under a free market system,\" he said.\"Government intervention has put thou-sands of farmers out of business, and in theprocess, gouged consumers.\" Wenzel also said he would support an effort to create a compact with neighboringstates to guarantee dairy farmers a fair mini-mum price. So far this session, neither proposal has been introduced in the form of a bill, butseveral legislative proposals related to dairypricing are expected to be debated beforelawmakers adjourn in May. The children's list Last November, authorities at Lino Lakes prison discovered a computerized list of thenames of 3,000 children from outstate Min-nesota. The prisoner suspected of compilingthe list is a repeat child molester who isscheduled for release in January 2002. Recently, a second list was found with about 2,600 names \u2014 and addresses in manycases \u2014 of children in the Twin Cities metro area. Authorities believe the names on both lists were gathered from public sources, suchas newspapers, and that the lists are between4 and 10 years old. \"We'll probably never know all the sources with respect to where the names came from,\"said Dennis Benson, deputy commissionerof the Department of Corrections, duringtestimony before the House Judiciary Com-mittee Jan. 29. Benson concedes that compiling such a list is not illegal, which has made it difficultto formulate a departmental response. \"It's certainly disturbing, but not illegal,\" Benson said. \"The individual's history, how-ever, heightens our level of concern.\" Roger Wheeler, a special agent with the corrections department, said the incidentwill generate a criminal investigation, then apossible grand jury indictment. \"We continue to review our internal poli- cies,\" Benson said. \"We will work with theLegislature on any bill you might produce.\" The prisoner had computer access through Insight, Inc., a prison telemarketing pro-gram. He also had access to the Internet anda modem. An investigator told membersthat while there is no evidence the list wasdistributed, there is no way to prove it wasnot. Information detailing who received e-mail from prisoners is not available. Investigators believe that none of the chil- dren on the list have been contacted by theprisoner or by others. David Crist, acting commissioner of cor- rections, said that prisoners no longer haveaccess to the Internet or other computersthrough a modem. They continue, however,to operate the telemarketing company andother computer programs, all on \"standalone\" computers, he said. Several legislators had concerns about in- mates' continued access to computerizedinformation and questioned whether theyshould have any access to computers. At the time of the meeting, the corrections department had sent letters to 700 familiesof children whose names appeared on thelist. They intended to send letters to remain-ing families by Jan. 31 and also have estab-lished an information line for concernedparents at (612) 603-0026. \"This is a yellow caution light in terms of the computer age, the Internet, and technology,\"Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) said. \"Wehave to be careful regarding the ease withwhich information is available to any one indi-vidual.\" Possible legislation stemming fromthe incidents may affect computer access by5 January 31, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYprisoners and parolees, data privacy laws, or school and other lists with information aboutchildren, Dawkins said. Rep. Henry Kalis, foreground , and the rest of the Capital Investment Committee, took a tour of the Lino Lakes Correctional Facility Jan. 30.

Many arrests were made,guns were taken off the street, and the city'smurder rate did not reach the record level of1995. Now the $226,000 bill for those extralaw officers has come to the Legislature. The cost of deploying 25 state troopers, three to five Bureau of Criminal Apprehen-sion agents and a state patrol helicopter waspaid for out of the state's trunk highwayfund. Legislation ) sponsored by Lieder (DFL-Crookston) authorizesthe commissioner of finance to transfer$226,000 from the general fund to reim-burse the trunk highway fund before thecurrent fiscal year ends on June 30, 1997.The bill was discussed Jan. 28 by the HouseTransportation and Transit Finance Divi-sion, which Lieder chairs. Don Davis, state commissioner of public safety, recounted for the committee theevents leading up to the trooper deploy-ment. In late August 1996, Minneapolis ap-peared to be careening toward another recordhomicide level, Davis said. The New York Times had carried a story labeling Minnesota's largest city \"Murderapolis,\" andGov. Arne Carlson and Lt. Gov. JoanneBenson had both just returned from over-seas trips concerned about the image Min-neapolis was acquiring. On Aug. 25, therewere three more murders while MayorSharon Sayles Belton and Police Chief Rob-ert Olson were out of town. Two days later,Carlson summoned Davis to his office andwanted to know what the state could do toimmediately address the crime problem inMinneapolis. After discussing the matter withcity council and police officials, it was de-cided to send in 15 state troopers and threeto five BCA agents to assist Minneapolispolice for a 60-day period. A state patrolhelicopter and pilot were also assigned to thecity. The results were dramatic, according to Davis. The state troopers made 1,089 arrestsand assisted in responding to 505 emergency911 calls. Among the arrests were 66 weap-ons-related, 196 for outstanding warrants,86 for other felonies, and 154 for drivingwhile intoxicated or without a license. ChiefOlson has reported that after the troopersleft, crime rates in the fourth and fifth pre-cincts have stayed down, Davis said.Fred Corrigan, vice president of the Min- nesota Transportation Alliance, told the com-mittee that his group is sympathetic to theproblems experienced in Minneapolis and issupportive of state assistance, but also con-cerned about the use of highway trust funddollars for non-highway purposes. \"Statelaw is very specific about the use of trust funddollars and trunk highway dollars in statingthese dollars shall be used solely for highwaypurposes,\" Corrigan said. The committee voted to support HF19 . It will be included in the division's omnibusfunding bill. More education dollars A bill that would avert a $337 million cut in funding for public schools passed theHouse on Jan. 30. The vote was 133-0. The bill ( HF1 ), sponsored by Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park), wouldrepeal spending caps that became law as partof a 1995 education spending package. The caps, effective with the start of the 1998-99 biennium, would force a reductionin the per-pupil amount each school districtreceives from the state and would alter theformula used by the state to calculate fund-ing levels for secondary students. \"I believe this bill is an example of good government at work,\" Johnson said. \"I saythat because we listened to the people ofMinnesota. They asked us to pass a bill thatwould restore the funding cuts.\"Passage of the bill was never really in doubt on the House floor. There was strong bipar-tisan support for the measure among Housemembers. However, some controversy wasstirred by an amendment offered on theHouse floor by Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka). The goal of the amendment was to hold the line on property taxes in those districtswith excess levy referendums or high prop-erty taxes in place as a result of the caps. Abrams offered the same amendment last week in the House Taxes Committee, only tosee it defeated. At the time, committee mem-bers agreed with the principle of the amend-ment but most expressed a desire to delivera \"clean bill\" that could move quickly throughthe legislative process. On the House floor, the merits of the amendment were hardly disputed. Johnson acknowledged the amendment addressed a \"legitimate issue,\" but she said itis not an issue \"to be considered at thistime.\" She suggested it would be better to tryto get the amendment included in the omni-bus K-12 education or tax bills that will beassembled later in the session. Ultimately, the amendment failed on a 94-37 vote. HF1 now goes to the Senate. Statewide testing Lawmakers are considering whether Min- nesota students should be subject to stan-dardized, statewide testing to measure pupiland school performance. Several statewide testing proposals are6 SESSION WEEKLY / January 31, 1997expected to be considered this year, but Gov. Arne Carlson's plan is the first to be taken upby a House committee. The governor's proposal ( spon- sored Koppendrayer (R-Princeton), who argued such testing wouldhelp to assure the quality of Minnesota'sschools. \"Minnesota prides itself on leading the way in public education,\" Koppendrayer saidJan. 30 before the House EducationCommittee's Subcommittee on Quality Ini-tiatives. \"Minnesota led the way on schoolchoice and in many other areas.\" The subcommittee took no action on HF235 . The bill would require that students in grades three, five, and eight take a singlenationally recognized test each spring, andthe bill would provide $5 million to financethe testing in 1998 and 1999. Statewide testing would provide a \"com- prehensive statewide assessment\" of how stu-dents, schools, and districts are doing,Koppendrayer said. Testing each student atvarious points throughout his or her aca-demic career would measure progress andidentify areas of concern. \"The earlier we start, the less threatening it is and the more useful it is,\" Koppendrayersaid, explaining the need to initiate testing atthe third grade level. \"It is something we canuse as a tool to build a child's education.\" Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids) con- tradicted those remarks, describing state-wide testing as \"a tool of punishment\" thatoffers nothing to help disadvantaged stu-dents. Identifying struggling students in third grade is too late, according to Kinkel. \"I promise you the state would get a much better return if you took that $5 million andput it into early childhood development,\" hesaid. Current state law prohibits the use of a single, statewide test in public schools. (State-developed tests are the most common meansof determining whether students meet thebasic skills requirements of Minnesota'sgraduation rule, but school districts also havethe authority to choose from more than adozen approved alternative exams.) Proponents of statewide testing argue that it would make schools more accountable byproviding an objective measurement of stu-dent performance and a reliable foundationfor comparing schools across both districtsand states. Opponents claim statewide testing would provide no information about student per-formance that their teachers don't alreadyknow and that the testing could have a nega-tive effect on students, causing unnecessary anxiety and driving up dropout rates. \"A statewide test just pits school district against school district,\" said Rep. JimTunheim (DFL-Kennedy). Koppendrayer, who described the bill as a work in progress, said it likely will be alteredto include the recommendations of a re-cently released University of Minnesota re-port on statewide testing. That report, required under a 1995 educa- tion funding law, maps out a comprehensiveapproach for implementation of statewidetesting. Major recommendations in the report call for statewide testing of students at four gradelevels and suggest that the new testing belinked to the graduation standards requiredunder current law. Pre-Labor Day school Students accustomed to savoring the La- bor Day weekend as the last hours of sum-mer freedom may be in for a surprise undera bill headed for the House floor.HF84 , sponsored by Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal), would allow school districtsto begin classes before Labor Day in 1998and 1999. The bill was approved by the HouseEducation Committee on Jan. 28. The reason for the bill is simple enough. Labor Day falls relatively late in Septemberfor the next two years (Sept. 7 and Sept. 6,respectively) and that can foul up the sched-ule for the entire academic year, Carlsonsaid. The bill even has the support of one major tourism industry group. But any discussionof the current state law mandating that schoolbegin after Labor Day is bound to attractsome controversy. Tourism groups are usually the most vo- cal defenders of the law because those busi-nesses benefit from the later school start. Itkeeps available the teenagers they rely uponto fill seasonal jobs, and it stretches the sea-son for summertime family vacations. The law's detractors include those who believe the academic calendar should be setby local school boards and those advocatingalternative school schedules. Bob Meeks, a lobbyist for the Minnesota School Boards Association, said HF84 is the result of negotiations between his organiza-tion and the Minnesota Restaurant, Hotel &Resort Associations, a trade group that lob-bies for the hospitality and tourism busi-nesses. \"They gave up quite a bit,\" Meeks willing to compromise. . . . Ob-viously, they understand the need for educa-tion, and we understand their need to makea living.\" Another tourism industry organization \u2014 The Minnesota Association of Innkeep-ers \u2014 registered its opposition to the bill ina memo to committee members. The bill stirred little controversy in the committee, but the reaction of some mem-bers hinted at a larger debate that may lieahead this session. Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) said lawmakers need to discuss expanding thetime for learning by extending hours in aschool day and adding days to the schoolyear. \"I believe this bill is a Band Aid,\" Folliard said. To merge or not to merge A plan to merge two Twin Cities postsecondary schools was presented to theEducation Committee's Higher EducationFinance Committee Jan. 27. Under the plan, developed by the Eric Hanson, Stillwater, a senior and studentbody vice president at the University ofMinnesota, expressed his support for a bill Jan.24 that would appropriate $45 million to reducethe cost of tuition for students attending stateeducational institutions.7 January 31, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYELECTIONSMinnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU) at the direction of the Legislature,Metropolitan State University (MSU) andMinneapolis Community and TechnicalCollege (MCTC), both in Minneapolis,would merge. The combined school wouldfunction much like a four-year educationalinstitution, according to MnSCU Chancel-lor Judith Eaton. Eaton said the plan is meant to increase the ability of inner city students to obtaincollege degrees. \"There's an enormous need for additional higher education opportunities, especiallyin the future,\" Eaton told the committee. \"Ithas become more and more important tolook at plans that cut across existing institu-tions and remove barriers. Minneapolis andMinnesota have an opportunity that is left infew urban centers.\" Eaton said the plan is, in part, a response to the changing demographics of the TwinCities. (See related story, page 15.) The state's minority population grew 75 percent be-tween 1980 and 1990, according to the re-port compiled by MnSCU, which also saysthat 87 percent of that population resides inthe Twin Cities seven-county metro area.Many are poor and undereducated, accord-ing to the report. The merger plan, Eaton said, would ad- dress the growing need to reach out to andeducate that increasing population. Basedon her experiences in other major cities, it'sa critical issue. \"The erosion of which I'mspeaking is not as bad as it's going to get,\" shetold the committee. \"The answer is to ex-pand educational opportunities in Minne-apolis before it's too late.\" Under the plan, which was one of five options MnSCU examined, the two schoolswould form one at the existing campus ofMCTC. MSU now rents space on HennepinAvenue, just a few blocks from MCTC, whichis itself the product of a recent merger. \"Whilea major investment in facilities would benecessary, the costs would be much less thanbuilding a new campus,\" the report states. The plan was met with mixed reactions from committee members. Rep. LyndonCarlson (DFL-Crystal) expressed concernabout the site-selection process, but said hewould wait until further hearings to exam-ine the issue more closely. \"The magnitudeand complexity of the decision on site selec-tion is so great that it needs more in-depthdiscussion,\" Carlson said. The 1996 Legislature, in two pieces of legislation, directed MnSCU to plan forMSU's future. One called for a master plan for the TwinVote from home A House panel is taking another look at easing the process of voting by absentee bal-lot. An attempt to do so last year got tangledwith other election issues and never made itto the House floor, according to Secretary ofState Joan Growe. The sponsors of HF74 would like to make voting by absentee ballot available to any-one. Under current law, voters must haveone of several reasons to vote outside anofficial absence fromthe precinct; illness; election judge in another pre-cinct. HF74 would remove the reasons for which a voter may vote by absentee ballot, and state\"Any eligible voter may vote by absenteeballot. . . .\" \"This proposal would result in more people participating in the process,\" Growe saidduring testimony before the House GeneralLegislation, Veterans Affairs and ElectionsCommittee Jan. 27. \"Voter participation is in decline,\" Growe continued. \"The last [primary] election hadthe second lowest voter turnout ever.\" Growe said the new legislation would rem- edy some of the causes that keep people fromvoting. Many voters cannot take the time tostand in line at polling places. Others, espe-cially the elderly, are uncomfortable ventur-ing onto often-hazardous roads during No-vember in Minnesota, she said. \"Lifestyle changes within the voting popu- lation are factors that cannot be underesti-mated,\" Growe said. \"This bill addresses theconcerns of these voters. It permits people tovote at the time and place of their choosing.\" Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul), the bill's sponsor, said, \"In this day and age, we haveto try to maximize voter turnout. We have toFAMILYCities area and a permanent site for MSU'scampus. (The school currently rents.) \"Theplan must consider short- and long-termdemographic and enrollment projections. . . and coordination and duplication ofprogram offerings.\" The second law said MnSCU's board of trustees should \"determine how best to im-prove the delivery of comprehensive, qualityeducational programs,\" and consider merg-ing MSU with other campuses. Rep. Gene Pelowski, (DFL-Winona), com- mittee chair, said that future hearings on theissue will be held.reach out. We have to be experimental.\" In last year's state primary election, only 13.2 percent of qualified voters cast ballots.In the general election, 64.8 percent voted.Since 1950, general election turnout hasranged from a high of 83.9 percent in 1956 toa low of 47 percent in 1986. Members were quick to distinguish ab- sentee balloting from mail balloting, whichis now permitted in 161 precincts in citiesand townships with fewer than 400 regis-tered voters. Also, there are numerous special elections in counties, municipalities, and school dis-tricts that allow ballot questions to be votedon by mail, according to Joe Mansky of theOffice of the Secretary of State. The primary difference between the two types of voting is that voters must request anabsentee ballot; mail-in ballots are mailed toall registered voters. In 1996, Gov. ArneCarlson vetoed a measure to extend mailballoting to cities with fewer than 1,000 reg-istered voters, calling it \"a creeping spread ofan unwise policy.\" To prevent fraud and abuse, HF74 has tight controls addressing who can handle theballots and how ballots must be requested. Lawmakers plan to vote on HF74 after ensuring that certain provisions conformwith the state's Data Practices Act. Parental visitation In November 1995, the Minnesota Su- preme Court asked a task force to examinevisitation issues among families who haveundergone divorce and recommend ways toaddress related problems. Among the questions explored by the panel: Should a non-custodial parent be al-lowed to withhold support payments if acustodial parent interferes with court-or-dered visitation rights? The task force answered with a resound- ing \"no,\" and recommended against linkingvisitation and child support. Doing so, ac-cording to the report, \"may encourageadversarial behavior . . . and negatively im-pact the emotional and financial well-beingof the children involved.\" The report was presented to the House Judiciary Committee's Civil and Family LawDivision Jan. 29 by task force members PeterParilla of the Sociology Department at theUniversity of St. Thomas, and Julie Brunner,county administrator in St. Louis County. \"What came through is that there's a need8 SESSION WEEKLY / January 31, 1997 for visitation enforcement to catch up with support enforcement \u2014 but not to linkthem,\" said Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St.Paul), committee chair. \"That equals adouble-whammy for kids: They don't get thevisitation and they don't get the support.\" The panel also examined: how often par- ents interfere with visitation rights; the fre-quency with which non-custodial parentsfail to exercise their visitation rights; and theimpact a lack of access to the courts has oncompliance with visitation issues. Included in the task force's recommenda- tions are: parent education and other family-sup- port programs should be increased con-siderably and, in some cases, participa-tion should be mandated; court officers should be better educated on matters related to divorce; compensatory visitation rights should be more regularly awarded to parents whohave been wrongfully denied visitation,and sanctions imposed against parentswho deny them; custody arrangements should be modified if a pattern of persistent denial of visita-tion occurs over a three-month period orlonger \u2014 if doing so is in the best interestof the child; and visitation expediters (neutral parties quali- fied to moderate visitation disputes)should be used more frequently. Those attending the hearing, though on various sides of the issue, seemed to approveof the task force report. Testifying before thecommittee were representatives from theFather's Resource Center, R-Kids, Aces (agroup that works for compliance with sup-port orders), Catholic Charities, and media-tors and attorneys. Dawkins said the next step is for legisla- tors to come forward with bills in support ofthe recommendations. HUMANITIES Strengthening the humanities The staff of the Minnesota Humanities Commission (MHC) hosted a tour for sev-eral Minnesota lawmakers Jan. 27 to showoff their renovated building and encouragecontinued funding of their programs. The Humanities Education Center, near St. Paul's Phalen Park, was originally thewest wing of the Gillette State Children'sHospital, a state-funded hospital establishedin 1897 that provided free care for childrenwith disabilities.The wing housed the children's school and was named the Michael Dowling Me-morial Hall, in honor of a state legislatorwho lost his hands and feet to frostbite at age14. He became an advocate for people withdisabilities. Public and private dollars renovated the structure for $2.6 million. Members of the House Economic Devel- opment Finance Division listened to testi-mony about commission programs such asMOTHEREAD/FATHEREAD, which pro-motes family reading; Teacher Institute,which resi-dential seminars for teachers; and grants forpublic community humanities projects. The MHC receives $586,000 per year in state dollars and is requesting the sameamount during the 1998-1999 budgetingperiod. The humanities consist of history, litera- ture, philosophy, archaeology, modern andclassical languages, ethics, jurisprudence,comparative religion, linguistics, culturalanthropology, and history and criticism ofthe arts. \"People need a strong humanities back- ground to productive adults,\" saidCheryl Dickson, the commission's executivedirector. Jan Wolden, a junior high teacher from Owatonna, Minn., shared her experience aspart of the Teacher Institute. In 1994, sheattended a week-long seminar on the \"Cross-cultural Understanding of Health and Ill- Jessica Roth, right , classmate Kayla Karnes, left, and the rest of the eagles waited to play their parts during the Prairie Woods Elementary School's performance of \"Ronald Raven Saves WetlandHollow\" in the Capitol rotunda Jan. 29.

JeriAnn Angelo, a reading specialist from Minneapolis, spoke of the successes ofMOTHEREAD/FATHEREAD. \"Many kids come into school not able to read or even listen to a story.\" The readingprogram helps train parents and caregivershow to read to their children and apply themessages of culturally diverse literature todaily life, Angelo said. Currently about 300 sites around the state are trained in MOTHEREAD/FATHEREAD,and there is a waiting list. Theodore Schaum, a retired college pro- fessor, spoke of his MHC grant that allowshim to run a discussion series out of theDetroit Lakes Library. Several times a month 35-65 people in the area come to discuss topics such as \"Canpoetry matter?\" \"Can the heart be filled racism strongerthan ever? \u2014 II.\" Schaum said the discussion series, known as Great Minds Appreciation DiscussionCircle, \"brings intellectual stimulation\" to acommunity void of a college or university. All communities need a cultural life, he said, adding that the MHC helps give Min-nesota a \"good intellectual climate.\"9 January 31, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYLABOR SPORTS Workers' comp refund The board of the Workers Compensation Reinsurance Association (WCRA) will beauthorizing a $440 million refund Jay Benanav toldthe House Labor-Management RelationsCommittee Jan. 27. The amount of the dis-tribution must be approved by the state com-missioner of labor and industry and the com-missioner of commerce. The WCRA provides reinsurance to pri- vate insurance companies and to self-in-sured businesses for large claims such asthose involving brain, spinal cord, or backinjuries. The nonprofit insurance associa-tion was established by the Minnesota Legis-lature in 1979 in response to concerns aboutthe availability and cost of workers' com-pensation reinsurance. The WCRA is thestate's exclusive provider of excess workers'compensation reinsurance. The agency is able to keep the cost of reinsurance premiums down through suc-cessful investment and management of itsreserves, Benanav said. It is the success ofthese investments, along with fewer claimsfiled than anticipated, that has led to theWCRA's surplus. The 1997 refund will be the fourth in recent years. In 1992 and 1993, the WCRArefunded $100 million and $302 million,respectively. After the 1997 refund, theWCRA will have given back nearly everydollar it has ever collected in premiums.Also, since July 1996, the WCRA has applied$42.5 million in excess reserves to lowerpremiums paid by insurance companies andself-insured employers. The refunds will notimpair the agency's ability to pay futureclaims, Benanav told the committee. Following the 1993 surplus declaration, the Legislature enacted a law requiring theWCRA to pass on the 1992 and 1993 excesssurplus refunds to employer policyholdersrather than to the insurance company mem-bers. Litigation initiated by insurance com-panies resulted in a federal judge's ruling in1994 that the Legislature could not retroac-tively require the surpluses built up beforethe law passed to be refunded directly topolicyholders. Therefore, insurance com-pany members were allowed to keep the$402 million surplus which had already beendeclared by the WCRA board. The ruling didnot affect refunds directly to self-insuredemployers. The judge did not rule on the constitu- tionality of the 1993 law as it applied tofuture distributions of WCRA surpluses, Benanav said. \"Our board of directors intends to follow the law as it was amended in 1993. This willresult in distributions of approximately $140million to Minnesota employers and $260million to insurance companies.\" NOTES Jeff Mausolf, president of the Minnesota UnitedSnowmobile Association, told the Environmentand Natural Resources Committee Jan. 27 that hisassociation would support a $5 increase in licensefees if more money was spent on the constructionof more snowmobile trails.Trail funding crisis Minnesota's snowmobile trail fund has an operating deficit of $2.5 million for the 1997fiscal year, according to a report from theMinnesota Snowmobile Advisory Commit-tee (MSAC). The report was included intestimony delivered to the House Environ-ment and Natural Resources Finance Com-mittee Jan. 27 in a plea for increased snow-mobile trail funding. Dennis Asmussen, director of Trails and Waterways for the Minnesota Departmentof Natural Resources, told the committeethat the state's Snowmobile Trail Enforce-ment Account is not adequate to operate andmaintain the existing 18,047 mile trail sys-tem. The fiscal year 1997 appropriation is$6.1 million, though approximately $8.6million is actually needed. The report cites a number of factors lead-ing to what the MSAC has called a crisis in snowmobile trail funding, including: a 41 percent increase in the number of registered snowmobile users in the past10 years for a total of 255,000 in 1996; ridership averaging 1,400 miles per year, per machine, up from 500 miles in the late1980s; and aging trail maintenance equipment in need of replacement. In addition, Asmussen told the commit- tee that the MSAC recommends adding 3,322miles of trail. \"Most of these trail proposalsare based on historic use patterns and needsthat have gone unanswered,\" Asmussen said.\"The proposed trails would complete trailsystems, create linkages and spread use outfrom heavily used existing trails.\" The report estimates the cost of building the additional miles of trails at $4.2 million.Another $2.5 million is needed to to mod-ernize the existing system. The report esti-mates the annual cost of operating and main-taining a new enlarged trail system at $9.5million. \"Minnesota's snowmobile trails are the state's single largest economic developmentproject and it is borne on the backs of volun-teers,\" Jeff Mausolf, president of MinnesotaUnited Snowmobile Association said of thecurrent state trail maintenance system. Heexpressed concern that many volunteers arefeeling overwhelmed and may not continue.\"In 1993-94, our people logged 194,000 hoursin trail maintenance and grooming.\" Mausolf said his group supports an in- crease in the annual snowmobile registra-tion fee from $10 to $15 and an increase inthe gasoline tax to pay for the trail expan-sions and improvements. He noted that theextra expenditures would be a good invest-ment since \"Winter recreationists who cometo snowmobile will spend more than anyother winter visitors to the state.\" When the commissioner of Minnesota's Department of Veteran's Affairs presentedthe House Governmental OperationsCommittee's State Government FinanceDivision with his agency's performance re-port Jan. 29, he pointed out that customersoften confuse the state's veteran's affairs of-fice with the similarly named federal depart-ment. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia),the division's chair, offered some sound po-litical advice: \"Remind them that you're fromMinnesota when they like you and just don'tsay anything when they don't. We politi-cians do that all the time.\"10 SESSION WEEKLY / January 31, 1997Lotteries have long been used to raise money forunderfunded causes, fromMichelangelo's painting onthe Sistine Chapel ceiling tothe American Revolution- ary War. In Minnesota, the lottery has beenwed to funding for environmental causes. \"It is an unholy alliance,\" quipped Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth) in recount-ing the history of the state's Environmentand Natural Resources Trust Fund. Thematch came about in 1988 when Munger,long-time chair of the House Environmentand Natural Resources Committee, waspushing a bill to set up the state's Environ-ment and Natural Resources Trust Fund. Atthe same time, Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St.Paul) was also trying to jump start legislationfor a state-run lottery. When the two billsmet in the House Rules and Legislative Ad-ministration Committee, it was not longbefore they were united, Munger said. In the fall of 1988, Minnesotans voted by a margin of more than three-to-one to au-thorize a state-run lottery with a portion ofthe proceeds going to support environmen-tal causes. In 1990, voters supported dedi-cating 40 percent of the lottery's net rev-enues to the Environment and Natural Re-sources Trust Fund until Dec. 31, 2000. Theremaining 60 percent of net lottery proceedsare now allocated to the state's general fund.When the lottery legislation originally passed,35 percent of lottery profits funded capitalimprovements for educational facilities andenvironmental projects. The remaining 25percent was marked for the now defunctGreater Minnesota Corporation, a joint pub-lic-private venture which encouraged eco-nomic development and job growth inGreater Minnesota. This session the Legislature is considering a bill ( HF113 ) sponsored by Rep. Munger which would extend the trust fund's ties tothe lottery until 2050. It won approval Jan.29 from the Environment and Natural Re-sources Committee. According to a report from the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources(LCMR), the lottery has contributed $149million to the trust fund since it began in1991. About seven cents of every dollar spentby lottery players goes to the fund, which iscurrently worth about $140 million. Most ofthe funds are invested in an equal mix ofstocks and bonds. Given stable lottery sales,Saving the trust fund . . . Bill may extend lottery's environment dollars to 2050 the LCMR projects that the trust fund willreach $1 billion in assets by the 2016. To date, the trust fund has contributed approximately $60.5 million to 87 environ-mental projects. Forty more projects are pro-posed for 1998-99, which would increasetotal trust fund expenditures to about $81million. (An additional $22 million has beenleveraged from the private sector with an-other $4 million promised by 1999.) \"Environmental enhancement is not a short-term fix,\" said Nancy Gibson of theCitizens Advisory Committee on the Trust Fund. She testified in favor of HF113 along with a dozen other environmental activistsat the Jan. 29 hearing. \"We do know thatspending dollars on environmental preser-vation is a lot cheaper than paying for recov-ery,\" she added. Gabe Horner of the Nature Conservancy presented data to the committee from a sur-vey her organization conducted to gauge theopinions of Minnesotans on environmentalissues and the Environment and NaturalResource Trust Fund. The survey included400 registered voters from throughout thestate who were polled Nov. 21-22, 1996.(The results have a margin error of plus orminus 4 percent.) According to the survey, 86 percent of Minnesotans continue to support dedicat-ing lottery proceeds to the environment.Ninety-seven percent of those surveyedagreed with the statement: \"Natural areasand lakes are an important part of our heri-tage and should be preserved for future gen-erations.\" Some 87 percent agreed that\"Minnesota's lakes, farm lands, and otheropen spaces will soon be lost forever if we donot protect them now.\" When asked aboutthe distribution of lottery profits, 69 percentsaid they would favor increasing the amountdedicated to the Environment and NaturalResources Trust Fund. Ron Nargang, deputy commissioner for the Department of Natural Resources, toldthe committee that Gov. Arne Carlson willsupport the bill but would have preferred todeal with the issue in 1998. Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul) said that he would like to see the dedication oflottery funds extended even longer than 2050.Osthoff has introduced a similar bill ( HF111 ) which would make the marriage between theenvironment and lottery \"perpetual and in-violate forever.\" HF113 now moves to the Environment and Natural Resources Finance Committee. \u2014 Steve ComptonA bill for an act ating to civil actions; modifying and expanding rovisions for sanctions in civil actions; Statutes subdivision 6; and 609.5314, subdivision 3; proposing coding for new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 549; repealing Minnesota Statutes 1994, section 549.21.

The deadlinesserve to weed out some of the severalthousand bills introduced each year. The first committee deadline is Wednesday, March 26 . That means all bills must be passed out of all policycommittees in their house of origin toreceive further consideration this ses-sion. If a House bill hasn't been ap-proved by House policy committeesby the deadline, but its Senate com-panion has, the bill has met the com-mittee deadline. By the second committee deadline \u2014 Wednesday, April 9 \u2014 all bills other than those containing appro-priations, must be passed out of allpolicy committees in both the Houseand the Senate. The deadline does notapply to the finance divisions of thecommittees or the Rules and Legisla-tive Administration Committee, theTaxes Committee, and the Ways andMeans Committee. By Friday, April 18 , all appropria- tions bills must clear their policy andfinance committees and move to ei-ther the Taxes Committee or Waysand Means Committee. Of course, there are exceptions to the deadlines. Any lawmaker may tryto convince the Rules and LegislativeAdministration Committee, whichincludes leaders from both party cau-cuses, to hear a bill after the deadlines. Reps. Betty Folliard and Satveer Chaudhary, along with other members of the Higher EducationFinance Division, used laptop computers available to Northwest Technical College studentsduring a committee hearing Jan. 24. The lawmakers simulated a lab procedure that wouldnormally cost $100,000 by creating circuit boards, and then running tests on those boards. GaryEllingson, a faculty member from the Moorhead campus, left at witness table , led them through the procedure.12 SESSION WEEKLY / January 31, 1997Presiding over hours and hours of some- times contentious debate on the floor of theMinnesota House of Representatives can betoo much for one person. Even if the speaker's hectic schedule doesn't demand he be elsewhere, simple exhaustionmay require him to call in some relief. This session, two lawmakers will share duties as backup to Speaker Phil Carruthers(DFL-Brooklyn Park). Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud) and Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls) have beennamed speakers pro tempore , as the position is officially known (or pro tem for short). As the title makes clear, the speaker pro tem assumes the role of the speaker on atemporary basis whenevernecessary. \"Later in the session, we are on the floor for very, very long periodsof time,\" Opatz said. \"It's just physi-cally difficult for a person to standup there for a dozen hours in a row. \"Just as importantly, the speaker is going to have to be meeting withother members, conference com-mittees, the governor, [Senate Ma-jority Leader] Roger the mi-nority leadership. [Carruthers] willhave other responsibilities that takehim away from the floor, and that'swhere our role comes in.\" While their time in the speaker's chair may be limited, Opatz andWejcman likely will be required tomake quick decisions on important,controversial issues. Seemingly mundane procedural rulings, such as deciding whetheran amendment is germane to a bill,can have a significant effect on theultimate fate of the legislation. \"Determining if an amendment is germane can be a major issue,especially as we get to the end ofsession,\" Wejcman said. \"There willhave to be a lot of trust on the partof other legislators that I will be fairand I will make the right decisions.\" Wejcman and Opatz have been selected to fill a position that is relatively new in thehistory of the House. House rules have long allowed for tempo- rary speakers, but the practice of selecting astand-in has varied. Designating a speakerpro tem is a practice less than two decadesold.Speakers . . . Opatz, Wejcman take speaker's gavel when needed Before the 1980s, temporary speakers could not serve for more than one day. Andinstead of being appointed by the speaker,they were chosen by a majority of the Houseor by the House Rules and Legislative Ad-ministration Committee. Carruthers began his new job as speaker with a vow to foster bipartisan cooperationin the lower chamber. The speakers pro temsay they aim to support the speaker's efforts. \"I think I tend to be a fairly nonpartisan, objective person,\" Opatz said. \"I see myselfbehaving in a way very consistent with theway [Carruthers] would like the floor tooperate. It should be businesslike, and itshould be civil.\" The Legislature can meet the public's call for less partisanship, according to Wejcman. \"Everybody elected to the House is here with the intention of doing what their dis-trict wants and what they think is best forMinnesota,\" she said. \"We might differ alittle bit from district to district, but every-body is here because they really want to do the right thing.\" In addition to standing in for the speaker, Wejcman and Opatz will work with the ma-jority leader and assistant majority leaders aspart of the caucus' leadership team. Wejcman is beginning her fourth term representing what she describes as a \"won-derfully diverse\" district in south Minne-apolis. Neighborhoods in the district include a mix of people from varied ethnic groups andeconomic classes, according to Wejcman.And she has focused her legislative work onuniversally important issues: child care, hous-ing, employment, and safety. Wejcman sponsored a 1996 law that will require all new policeofficers hired after Aug. 1, 1997,to have completed a course incommunity policing. Opatz is in his third term rep- resenting a portion of St. Cloudand surrounding areas. Perhapshis most publicized legislativework was a 1996 law he spon-sored requiring insurance com-panies to allow mothers and theirnewborn babies to stay in thehospital for at least 48 hours. \"There is no other legislation that I have ever carried that hasgotten such a positive response interms of its personal impact onpeople's lives,\" he said. \". . .That'sbeen very gratifying.\" Opatz also has worked heavily on land-use planning issues, withan eye toward controlling urbansprawl. And he has been activeon issues related to education,which is something close to hisheart. When not tied up at theCapitol, he works as an adminis-trator at St. Cloud State Univer-sity. The speakers pro tem both say they are pleased to be part ofCarruthers' vision for the House. \"It's really an honor to have that faith put in you, to be trusted,\" Wejcmansaid. \u2014 Nick Healy Reps. Joe Opatz and Linda Wejcman have been named speakers protempore and will step up to the podium to give the speaker a break.13 January 31, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWhich capital city abode has sheltered world leaders, Olympic athletes, lumber bar-ons and even a pair of goats? The Governor'sResidence, of course, built on tony SummitAvenue in 1910. St. Paul lumberman Horace Hills Irvine paid $7,000 for a good-sized plot of landalong the prestigious roadway, which at thetime was an isolated retreat for the city'sleading citizens. With the automobile agestill in its infancy, most St. Paulites needed tohop an electric trolley to make it \"up the hill\"from the lower town. After Minneapolis architect William Channing Whitney completed his designs,Irvine secured a building permit, specifyingan estimated cost of $50,000 for a \"two-and-one-half story brick and stone dwelling.\" When completed, the 20-room English Tudor country manor house would sportnine bedrooms, an equal number of fire-places, and eight baths. It was equipped withboth gas and electrical outlets, (since elec-tricity was still a novelty at the time, and itsfuture was uncertain). A complex call boxand bell system covered most of the house,an ancestor of today's intercom. Perhaps themansion's most interesting gadget was a cen-tral vacuum cleaner \"with outlets through-out the house, and its mechanism in thebasement . . . intended to ease the task ofcleaning and free the staff for other house-hold matters,\" according to The Governor's Table : a Treasury of History and Hospitality at the Minnesota Governor's Residence . The book project was spearheaded by GretchenQuie, wife of Al Quie, Minnesota's 35th gov-ernor. Here, Irvine and his wife, Clotilde, raised four children and entertained elite friendssuch as the Pillsburys, Kelloggs, Bells, andOrdways. More than 50 years later, the housewould become the official MinnesotaGovernor's Residence. In 1965, a year after the death of Clotilde Hills Irvine, (Horace had died in 1947), thesurviving Irvine daughters gave the home at1006 Summit Avenue to the state of Minne-sota. The Legislature debated whether anaging home in disrepair was a wise invest-ment of taxpayer dollars. Florence Rolvaag, wife of sitting Gov. Karl Rolvaag, told reporters, \"One of the prob-lems of being governor in Minnesota is thatwe've never had an official place for digni-taries to stay. We've had to accommodatethem . . . . . Governor's Residence a treasure for all Minnesotans Social clubs, the State Capitol, and even thestate fairgrounds had also served as host sitesto prestigious visitors. Lawmakers quickly authorized the deal and marked $100,000 to renovate and oper-ate the building. Minnesota became the 41ststate to provide its governor with an officialresidence. The St. Paul Dispatch approved of the move, noting that in an effort to woo poten-tial businesses \"it probably is a help if agovernor has some spot where he can holdprivate conferences and gatherings, enter-tain and \"sell\" his state to corporate execu-tives and planners.\" State Sen. Gordon Rosenmeier said it would be a place where the governor couldhave a little \"dignity, pomp if you will.\" And also a place near the Capitol for the governor to sleep. But when Gov. KarlRolvaag, the first to occupy the Governor'sResidence, showed up with his family onmoving day, beds were nowhere to be found.Not only the cupboards but the floors werebare as well \u2014 of carpet and furniture. TheRolvaag's short-term solution was to bringfurnishings from their Arden Hills home. Efforts were soon under way to dress up the residence, and the Fine Arts Committeewas established to \"provide long-term en-couragement to the citizens of Minnesota to give appropriate gifts to the house.\" By Janu-ary 1966, more than 400 yards of carpetinghad been laid and the kitchen, bathrooms,basement, and third floor were remodeled.Fine art lined the walls and halls of the resi-dence, including a Rodin bust on loan fromthe Minneapolis Institute of Art. Construction continued during the LeVander administration with the help ofcontinued private donations and another$230,000 from the Legislature. IanthaLeVander, wife of Gov. Harold LeVander,was instrumental in decorating the residence.She wanted a \"simple but elegant working,living house,\" according to Minnesota Times and Tastes , published in 1993 by the 1006 Summit Avenue Society as a project ofcurrent First Lady Susan Carlson. LeVanderwanted the residence to \"look like agovernor's house.\" After all, when not the site of official meet- ings and formal teas, the mansion is a privatehome. Both its size and special attributeshave kept 15 children busy exploring itsnooks and crannies. Gov. Al Quie's son, Ben, played miniature golf in the attic. Gov. Wendell Anderson'sdaughter, Beth, recalls games of hide andseek with the chefs and security staff. There's The Governor's Residence has hosted many dignitaries over the years including former Soviet Unionhead Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 during Gov. Rudy Perpich's third term.14 SESSION WEEKLY / January 31, 1997For the folks who work in Greater Minne- sota newsrooms, the Capitol can seem amillion miles away. Each year, the Househosts an event designed to bridge that gap. More than 30 newspaper, radio, and tele- vision reporters from around the state con-verged on the CapitolJan. 30 for \"MediaDay on the Hill.\" The agenda in- cluded a full day ofevents designed tohelp members of themedia gather infor-mation about majorissues at hand valuable con-tacts to assist in cov-erage throughout thesession. \"It's not often that reporters fromGreater Minnesota can make it to the Capi-tol,\" said Brian McClung, a reporter forKCCO-TV in Alexandria, Minn. \"This is anice chance to spend some time here and toget to know more about what is happeningin St. Paul.\" Highlights of the day included lunch meet- ings with lawmakers from the home districtMedia Day on the Hill of each reporter and a question-and-answersession with House leadership, Speaker PhilCarruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center), Major-ity Winter (DFL-Fulda), andMinority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon). \"Government works best when everybody even a tunnel from the basement of themansion to the adjacent carriage house,where the Irvine children are said to haveplayed.

In 1971, Dyan LeVander, daughter of outgo- ing Gov. Harold LeVander, tacked a horse-shoe to her bedroom wall as a symbol ofgood luck for the incoming Wendell Ander-son family.

Since the Irvine's gave their family home to the state of Minnesota, seven governorsand their families have juggled public andprivate lives in the stately Summit Avenuemansion. What Gretchen Quie called\"Minnesota's house\" continues to host morethan 200 annual events and frequent publictours. Countless events throughout the yearshave been held there to honor Minnesotansfor their service or achievements. SusanCarlson has said living in the Governor'sResidence is a privilege, and she recognizesits place as a valued state resource. \"The stateis fortunate to have such a place where Min-nesotans can feel special.\" \u2014 John Tschida The reporters also heard from staff mem- bers from both caucus media offices and theHouse Public Information Office, who de-tailed the resources available to assist in cov-erage of Capitol events. And Chief Clerk EdBurdick led a refresher course on the legisla- tive process. To conclude the event, reportersheaded to the Housefloor to cover debateon one of the mosttalked about bills tocome up for a vote sofar this year. (The bill[HF1 ] would repeal caps on educationspending that requirea $337 million cutover the next twoyears.

Sviggum said that this legislative session will be different from others in recent history. \"We are not going to bring personalities into question and into the debate,\" he said.\"We are going to get the people's businessdone.\" Chief Clerk of the House Ed Burdick outlined the legislative process to out-state Minnesota newsreporters as part of Media Day on the Hill Jan. 30.15 January 31, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYCustomers at some Twin Cities fast-food burgerjoints get more than just a side of fries with their or-der; they also get a vision ofthe forces transforming theface of Minnesota'sworkforce. Increasingly, said Hazel H. Reinhart, the worker who takes your order isn't a teenager but some-one whose acne problems ended a long timeago \u2014 perhaps even a new retiree. More-over, she continued, the burger itself couldwell have been assembled by machine, un-touched by human hands. \"It's pretty clear to me that we're [soon] going to have a pretty substantial part of ourlabor force over the age of 45,\" Reinhart, thepresident of Reinhart Consulting Services,told an audience of legislators and staffers.\"More of them will be better educated, butthe bulk of the labor force will not havecollege degrees.\" Reinhart's Minneapolis-based firm pro- vides strategic marketing advice to business,education, and community orga-nizations. She also has served asstate demographer in both Min-nesota and Wisconsin. She spokein the Minnesota History Center's3M Auditorium on Jan. 28 at thefirst in a five-part series, \"DiscussingMinnesota's McKnight Foundation. The touchless-burger scenario, Reinhart said, illustrates what maybe the most overwhelming set ofsocial circumstances to confrontpolicymakers since the Great De-pression: rapidly expanding tech-nology combined with an agingworkforce ill-equipped \u2014 ill-suited \u2014 to adapt tonew, high-tech means of produc-tion.

State's aging workforce presents new challenges across the counter to hungry customers, hugenumbers of them \u2014 in mid-career and mid-life \u2014 will need to be retrained in skills theycould never have imagined when they firstentered the work force. \"That's one of our biggest challenges, and it must be done by the public sector,\"Reinhart said. \"It's a very major challenge \u2014and one that we don't have much experiencewith.\" In addition to a burgeoning cohort of older workers, Reinhart said, Minnesota isalso experiencing an increase in the numberof minorities entering the labor force, manyof whom are quite young. These youngpeople, she said, will be the ones replacingthe baby boomers as they retire. Minnesota'sprimary and secondary education systemmust be able to school them in the ways ofthe on-line world of work. Of course, Reinhart said, as soon as you think you've got one problem solved, a big-ger one rears its head. In this case, she ex-plained, it is the inevitable aging of America.By the year 2010, fully one-fifth ofMinnesota's population will be over the ageof 65. If current spending habits continue, Reinhart said, both Social Security and Medi-care will go broke, leaving hundreds of thou-sands of the newly retired without a financialsafety net. The key to avoiding catastrophe, Reinhart said, is to invest in both technology and theeducation \u2014 primary, secondary andpostsecondary \u2014 necessary to put the tech-nology to the most productive use. Upon completing her remarks, Reinhart opened the floor to questions and comments.Many legislators probed the implications ofthe demographic changes Reinhart had out-lined. Questions ranged from the effect anolder society would have on pension poli-cies, the housing market, and Minnesota'sinfrastructure to the increased potential forage discrimination. After Reinhart's lecture, several legislators said her remarks had given them new per-spective on the problems facing policymakerson the edge of a new millennium. \"When we're over at the Capitol, we're deal- ing with bills, we're dealing with specifics,\" saidSenate Minority Leader Dean Johnson (R- Willmar). points outthe big picture and broaderthemes.\" Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe (DFL-Erskine)agreed with Johnson, and saidthat Reinhart's insight hadprovided lawmakers with awake-up call of sorts. \"Demographics drive public policy, and what'smore predictable than demo-graphics?\" Moe asked. \"Whyare we always reacting?\" The series' second lecture will feature cultural anthro-pologist and author JenniferJames, who will offerthoughts on technology andhuman interaction. \u2014 F.J.

William Kuisle (R-High Forest Town- ship) sees his Rochester-area district as across section of the Minnesota politicallandscape. District 31A includes a slice of Rochester'surban center, a portionthat can best be de-scribed as suburbanRochester, and ruraltownships in Olmstedand Dodge counties. Accordingly, Kuisle (pronounced KWEEZ-lee) says he must con-sider issues from a broad perspective. Hemust consider the effects legislation will haveon constituents with diverse lifestyles, suchas rural family farmers, medical profession-als living on newly developed cul-de-sacs,and hourly wage workers renting apartmentsin the city. \"You have to make sure you're talking about issues that affect the whole district,\"Kuisle said. \"Up here [at the Capitol], yousee the split between rural and urban. I'mtalking about what's best for both sides. Ihave to come up with something that canwork for my district as a whole.\" Kuisle, 39, is a dairy farmer who works the farm his family has owned since the 1930s.He got his start in politics at the local levelwhen he was elected to the High Forest Town-ship Board in 1987. There, he served until elected to the Olmsted County Board in 1990. Kuisle re-signed as a commissioner just days beforebeing sworn in as a member of the House. With all that experience in local govern- ment, Kuisle's decision to seek higher officemay seem to be simply a natural progression.His story, however, is anything but typical.New members . . . Kuisle weighs issues from urban, rural perspective To get to the House, Kuisle had to get past a senior legislator from his own party. Thatperson was Rep. Don Frerichs (R-Roches-ter), a 16-year veteran and a minority caucusleader. Kuisle stunned Frerichs in the August 1996 primary election, and then held off a Frerichswrite-in campaign in November. (No DFLcandidate sought the seat.) Pundits were quick to attribute Kuisle's primary win to his opposition to legalizedabortion and support of Minnesota CitizensConcerned for Life, a political group thatopposes abortion. Kuisle said there was more to it than that.\"My district is very unique,\" he said. \"Only about 30 percent of the district is insideRochester city limits. A lot of people thought[Frerichs] represented Rochester and over-looked the rest of it.\" Kuisle's candidacy also created some con- troversy because of his switch in party affili-ation shortly before his run for the House.Kuisle explains his jump to Republicanismwith candor. \"I was on the wrong side, so I switched parties,\" he said with a laugh. More seriously, Kuisle explains that his political values have not changed and that hefound a more comfortable fit within theRepublican Party. \"I've always been fiscally conservative,\" he said. \"I treat the taxpayers' money as Itreat my own money. I want to make sure it'sspent wisely.\" Kuisle's agenda centers on his support for welfare reform, his desire to protect familyfarmers, and his wish to crack down on crime. A jump in crime overall and an increase in violence among juveniles have many peoplein the Rochester area concerned, Kuisle said.He wants to see steps taken to prevent crime and to provide relief for overburdened localpolice and courts. Where welfare reform is concerned, Kuisle sees an opportunity for the state to make realchanges in the wake of federal reforms thatwill end many federal programs and sendmoney to the states in the form of blockgrants. \"Anytime you talk welfare reform, you have to talk about moving people from wel-fare to work,\" he said. Kuisle considers the split between urban and rural interests in the Legislature to becomparable to partisan divisions. As he begins his legislative career, Kuisle is aiming to find solutions that best suit con-stituents who live in the country, the city,and everywhere in between. \"You've got to be willing to look at every- thing that comes up as to how it affects thewhole district \u2014 and the whole state \u2014 notjust part of it,\" he said. \"You have to try notto be anti-urban or anti-rural. You have tofind a balance.\" Nick District Largest southeastern Minnesota Top concern: \"Trying to deal with the crime in our district is going to be a top priority for thecommunity in coming years. Right now, thecounty attorney's office is swamped with cases,the courts are getting swamped, the probationofficers are swamped, the jail is overflowing.We're experiencing, like a lot of other communi-ties in the state, a rise in crime and the after-shocks of dealing with it.\" \u2014Rep. William KuisleRep. William Kuisle It's a fact!Before an overhaul of Minnesota's li- quor laws in the mid-1980s, it was illegal tosell liquor to a \"spendthrift, habitual drunk-ard or improvident person.\" That and other \"obsolete and unenforce- able\" provisions of state liquor law werethe subject of a 1977 Department of PublicSafety report recommending the repeal ofseveral outdated prohibitions, accordingto a March 24, 1977, report in the Minne- apolis Star . Specifically, state law made it illegal for anyone except a licensed pharmacist to sellliquor to spendthrifts and habitual drunkards within one year of notice bypolice, the person's parents or employ-ers, or anyone \"annoyed or injured bythe intoxication\" of such a person. A similar measure also prohibited to sale of liquor to anyone identified as a\"public prostitute.\" The 1977 report amounted to a plea to the Legislature to update the existingliquor laws, most of which were writtenearly in the 1900s or shortly after the repeal of Prohibition. Despite the urging of the public safety department, the 1977 Legislature leftthe archaic liquor laws on the books. The provision forbidding sales to spendthrifts remained intact until it wasrepealed by the 1984 Legislature. In 1985,lawmakers completed a thorough over-haul of state liquor laws. The 1985 legis-lation wiped out archaic portions of theliquor law and increased the legal drink-ing age from 19 to 21.Visiting the Minnesota State Capitol complex can be a rewarding and educational experience for everyone. There are buildings to explore and tours to take almost any time you choose to visit. And, when the Legislature is in session during the first part of every year, there are floorsessions to observe, committee meetings to attend, and legislators to meet.

At the beginning of a legislative session, the pace of floor sessions is generally slow as newbills are assigned to committees and non-controversial items are discussed. At aboutthe session's midpoint, however, the legisla-tive pace quickens. The House meets at 2:30 p.m. Mondays and Thursdays, and the Senate meets at 10a.m. Mondays and at 8 a.m. Thursdays dur-ing the first few weeks. House floor sessionsare scheduled for the afternoon because com-mittees meet in the morning and early after-noon. As the session nears the end, however,both bodies may meet several times a day,often into the night. All House and Senate floor sessions are open to the public. Visitors interested in ob-serving these sessions may call the HouseChief Clerk's or Sen-ate Information, (612) ques-tions. Spectators may sit in the galleries ofeither chamber.

When a public hearing is scheduled thecommittee may listen to comments from theaudience (when time permits) in addition tothe scheduled speakers. Committees have dif-ferent policies on hearing testimony, depend-ing upon their size and workload. Some com-mittees hear general testimony at the sub-committee level, while others allow generaltestimony during meetings of the full com-mittee. Informational handouts that com-mittee members receive during meetings orhearings are considered public informationand are available to the audience on a first-come, first-served basis. Major proposals on issues often have sev- eral public hearings so committee membersmay listen to all arguments for and against abill. Each committee has a chair, vice chair, administrator, and legislative assistant. A listof committees and members is available inthe House Public Information Office in Room175 of the State Office Building or the SenateInformation Office in Room 231 of the StateCapitol. Groups and individuals wishing to testify before a committee should call the appropri-ate committee's legislative assistant well inadvance of the meeting and ask to be placedon the agenda. Committees prefer requestsone week in advance but will accept laternotification when unexpected issues appearon the committee schedule. A brochure con-taining tips on testifying at legislative com-mittee hearings is available from the HousePublic Information Office. Dining All buildings in the Capitol complex have their own cafeterias. The Capitol and StateOffice Building cafeterias are in the base-ment. The Transportation and Centennialbuildings' cafeterias are on the ground floorof each building. The Veterans Service Build-ing cafeteria is on the fifth floor, and theCapitol Square Building's dining area is onthe lower level. The Capitol also has a snackbar on the second floor (where the House andSenate chambers are located) during the ses-sion. The Caf\u00e9 Minnesota is on the first levelof the Minnesota History Center. All cafete-rias serve breakfast and lunch. Group visits Sometimes groups plan a \"legislative day\" at the Capitol to express a particular view-point to legislators. Rooms for special conferences or speakers can be reserved by calling Betty Langenberger,(612) 296-5974, room scheduler for the StateOffice Building; or Marilyn Hall, (612) 296-0866, room scheduler for the Capitol. If group members want to meet with their individual legislators or testify before a com-mittee (see \"Committee meetings\"), arrange-ments should be made at least a week inadvance. Often such groups have members wear a distinctive name tag or badge to indicatetheir concern about a particular issue. Groups planning a trip to the Capitol should remember that seating is fairly lim-ited in some committee rooms \u2014 particu-larly when the topic is controversial.Where to find information House Public Information Office 175 State Office Building (612) 296-2146 or 1-800-657-3550 This nonpartisan office provides: com- mittee meeting schedules, legislator infor- mation; and publications, including the Session Weekly newsmagazine, educational brochures for all ages, and member direc- tories.

As an undergraduate, he wasin the student senate at St. Olaf College andlobbied for the state student coalition. Healso worked for Attorney General SkipHumphrey's office doing outreach. \"Aftercollege, I worked for Sen. (Ted) Kennedy inWashington, D.C. for a few months,\"Chaudhary said. \"That was a tremendousexperience.\" In 1992, Chaudhary took a year off from academics to work on the Tom Harkin presi-dential campaign and Gerry Sikorski's last6th District congressional race. Both candi-dates lost, but \"that experience providedsome important political lessons,\"Chaudhary said. \"During law school, I became more in- volved with my own community,\" he said. \"Istarted speaking to Columbia Heights [HighSchool] social studies classes about the im-portance of being involved with government.I also joined the Columbia Heights LionsClub and the Fridley Kiwanis, and became amember of the Fridley Human ResourcesCommission.\" Chaudhary's first run for office came whenhe was just two weeks out of law school. He ran in a July 1995 special election primaryfor the District 52A legislative seat, a Minne-apolis suburban area that includes parts ofFridley and New Brighton and all of Colum-bia Heights and Hilltop. Chaudhary lost thatrace, but came back to defeat the winner,Republican Skip Carlson, in 1996. \"The district really needed a strong repre- sentative for working families,\" Chaudharysaid. \"On top of the district's agenda areeducation, crime, taxes, welfare reform, andaffordable health care. We're an inner ringsuburban area and are facing a lot of pres-sures.\" Chaudhary is especially interested in edu- cation and economic development. \"With-out education you have higher crime andwithout economic development you have aweak tax base,\" he said. The other constituency Chaudhary ex- pects to hear from is Minnesota's Asian com-munity. \"I've already had some contacts fromthe Hmong community,\" he said. \"I hopeother Asian groups will bring me their con-cerns as well.\" \u2014 Steve Compton Top concern: \"On top of the district's agenda are education, crime, taxes, welfare reform, and afford-able health care. We're an inner ring suburban areaand are facing a lot of pressures.\" \u2014Rep. Satveer Chaudhary Staff of the Criminal Justice Center at Minnesota Planning presented a host of 1995statistics to the House Judiciary CommitteeJan. 27: Individuals aged 10 to 24 years old com- prised 21 percent of the state's popula-tion, but accounted for 69 percent of allNOTESarrests for violent and other serious crimes.In the seven-county metropolitan area,that population, numbered at 470,760 in1995, is expected to grow to 552,210 by2005, after which it will begin to decline.In the other 80 counties, that population,numbered at 323,680 in 1995, will peak at489,040 in 2000, then begin to decline. The number of arrests and apprehensions for all crimes \u2014 serious and minor \u2014rose from 144,211 in 1985 to 231,049 in1995. Less serious crimes accounted for 179,782 of the arrests and apprehensionsin 1995. While males accounted for 74 percent of arrests and apprehensions for the mostserious crimes, females showed the great-est increase: 36 percent since 1985. Nationwide, juvenile arrests for violent crime increased 107 percent in the 10years leading to 1995; adult arrests rose by81 percent. Those numbers are similar toMinnesota's.20 SESSION WEEKLY / January 31, 1997 In the Hopper . . .

Or, for example, look at the no frills two-seat pickup? It's probably not the popular vehicle it once was a few years ago. Nowadays, an individual owninga pickup drives one with a four-seat cab, more shiny chrome than a '56Chevy, plus room enough for the baby seat and dog bed included. And don'tforget to add four tires that are three sizes too large for the vehicle. Bigger is better. Even the re-release of the movie \"Star Wars\" is supposedly \"bigger and better\" than it was 20 years ago. At least Princess Leia's hairdoremains unchanged. Even such ideologies get debated by the Legislature. Creating new laws or improving on old ones are not always driven by how much more can beadded, or how much less something will cost. Fortunately, bills may getchanged because the legislative process is long and deliberate. Whether ornot a bill is designed to build a bigger mousetrap, reform welfare, build a newstadium, or provide cheaper health care, the more a bill is refined, the betterit will be, and the more it will be called a \"good bill.\" Basically, that is how the legislative process works. Ideas are introduced and bills are written and studied. They are thoughtfully worked on and evenamended if necessary to ensure that outcomes are not just bigger and better.The results should be a positive benefit to the citizenry. Although a key responsibility for legislators is to pass bills, some bills may not be the best they can be. But keeping in mind that bigger is not always better, one can trust that with patience, thought, and common sense,legislators will, in the long run, \"do the right thing.\" -LeClair G. Lambert3 February 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Week in Review . . . Jan. 30 - Feb. 6, 1997 Highlights Moving Minnesotans on welfare to the ranks of the employed may sound like astraightforward task. But, as state lawmakersare learning, the new federal welfare reformlaw is anything but. During the past week, members of both the Minnesota House and Senate have heldspecial hearings to listen to several groups \u2014such as legal immigrants and people withdisabilities \u2014 who stand to lose their publicassistance without state action. Hearings also have dealt with new federal work requirements and the child care andtransportation issues associated with them. States across the country are hurrying to pass new welfare laws after the federal gov-ernment scrapped the long-standing welfaresystem in August 1996. The federal law does away with monthly welfare checks and food stamps for manylegal immigrants and eliminates disabilitycash assistance for people with drug andalcohol addictions. It also eliminates cashassistance for children with certain disabili-ties and requires able-bodied adults, ages18-50, who receive food stamps to work. Perhaps the most significant change in- volves poor families with children. The lawrequires these parents to get a job and sets afive-year-lifetime limit on their welfare ben-efits. States that do not move these parents to work will be penalized by the federal government. While the federal law prescribes some of what states are required to do, it leaves eachstate to decide how to design its own welfaresystem. Below is a summary of some of the issues touched on during the past week. Disabled Portions of the federal law will hit families whose children have behavioral disorders, mild Welfare reform . . . Hearings put human face on federal welfare changes mental retardation, or certain chronic illnesses. These children are expected to lose their Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a fed-eral program begun in 1974 that providescash help to the needy who are aged, blind ordisabled. In Minnesota, some 3,200 children could lose their monthly SSI checks due to a morenarrow definition of \"disability\" in the fed-eral law. The average monthly benefit is $406and the cuts are set to take effect after July1997. Families whose children fall short of meet- ing a new definition of \"disabled\" told someMinnesota lawmakers Feb. 4 that they fearthe loss of their monthly check may forcethem to institutionalize their children. \"We want to keep Jennifer at home whereshe belongs,\" said Kathleen Sanders, a single mom from Coon Rapids, Minn., whose 9-year-old daughter has Down's Syndromeand attention-deficit problems. Sanders said her family's SSI check en- ables her to work 25 to 30 hours per weekbecause she can afford specialized day carefor Jennifer. It also helps pay for basics, suchas food and shelter. The mother said she worries that families like hers will begin to house their children inlarge institutions because they'll have noother choice. Either that, or they'll becomedestitute. Without the monthly check, \"I would not be able to work. I see no alternative but toapply for welfare,\" Sanders told committeemembers from the House Health and Hu-man Services Committee and the SenateHealth and Family Security Committee. According to Anne Henry of the Minne- sota Disability Law Center, the change in theSSI definition of \"disabled\" will affect manyother children as well. Another 700 Minnesota families of chil- \"We want to keep Jennifer at home where she belongs.\" \u2014 Kathleen SandersFour-Year-old Alex Rodenborg of Mora, Minn., who requires a feeding tube, as well as having othermedical needs, plays with his Winnie the Pooh bear as his mother, Robin, tells a joint House and Senatecommittee Feb. 4 about the difficulties her family will have caring for Alex without their monthly publicassistance check.4 SESSION WEEKLY / February 7, 1997dren with disabilities could lose their Medi- cal Assistance under the change. MedicalAssistance is a joint federal and state pro-gram that helps people who can't affordhealth care. And, another 150 families couldlose their access to a program that lets thembuy into Medical Assistance as added insur-ance coverage. Robin Rodenborg of Mora, Minn., and her 4-year-old son Alex also face the loss oftheir SSI check. Alex, who waved a stuffed Pooh bear and sat with his mother as she testified, has manymedical problems but, under the new defini-tion, no one problem by itself qualifies forfederal help. Alex has asthma, a cleft palette, a muscle at the bottom of his stomach that keeps himfrom digesting food properly, is far-sighted,deaf in one ear, and his jaw sits on top of hisairway. Currently, Rodenborg's monthly SSI check helps pay for Alex's feeding tube, special carseat, adaptive furniture, long distance callsto \"informed\" doctors (her access to doctorsis limited in rural Minnesota) as well as otherneeds. She's worried that insurance companies, schools, and hospitals will follow the federalgovernment's lead and cut benefits to peoplewith disabilities. In addition to children with disabilities, elderly and disabled legal immigrants willalso lose their monthly SSI check. That isestimated to affect some 5,400 legal immi-grants in Minnesota. Overall, legal immi-grants are cut off from most federal pro-grams. Tatyana Kasperovich of Minneapolis tes- tified on behalf of four immigrants from theformer Soviet Union who have survived re-ligious persecution, wars, and famine in theirhomeland and who are now about to losetheir public assistance here. \"Their only hope is God's mercy and the Legislature,\" Kasperovich said. Immigrants A crowd of about 300 people gathered at Christ Lutheran Church near the State Capi-tol Jan. 30 to hear how the loss of federalwelfare benefits will affect Minnesota's legalimmigrants and refugees. Kao Yang's story illustrates how a situa- tion far removed from state control can cre-ate an impact in Minnesota. \"I was con-scripted by the CIA to fight when I was 13years old,\" he told members of the Minne-sota Senate Health and Family Security Com-mittee and the House Health and HumanServices Committee through a translator.\"They gave me an M-16 that later exploded in my hand making me blind in my right eyeand limited the vision in my left eye. I mar-ried my wife while we lived in a refugee campin Thailand and we have six children. Wecame to the United States three years ago andhave not yet learned to speak English. Mywife doesn't have an education and can'tfind a job.\" Yang and many others stand to lose cur- rent welfare benefits because of federal changes. In all, the federal welfare law is expected to save the United States more than $50 billionover the next six years and much of thatsavings \u2014 $25 billion \u2014 targets the immi-grant population. The food stamp program tops the list of federal welfare programs that are now off lim-its to many legal immigrants. In Minnesota, anestimated 16,000 non-citizens will lose theirfood stamps in 1997. The average person re- ceives $63 per month in food coupons. Also, many elderly and disabled immi- grants will lose their SSI checks, which aver-age $378 a month to the needy who are aged,blind, or disabled. In Minnesota, 5,400 im-migrants are expected to lose their SSI. Yang's predicament is not that different from other refugees according to DavidZander, a research analyst for the Council onAsian-Pacific Minnesotans. \"There are suc-cess stories but others are struggling,\" Zandertold the hearing. \"What they all have incommon is that they followed a path toMinnesota that started by running from com-munists in southeast Asia.\" Some wondered how many immigrants could live should benefits be removed. \"I'm most concerned about the impact of these changes on the elderly, people whowere wounded during the war, people suf-fering from posttraumatic stress,\" said LeePao Xiong, executive Councilon Asian-Pacific Islanders. \"I can't see howmany of these people can survive.\" Mia Lee, a 62-year-old Hmong woman is one such person. The cane she uses to steadyher walk bears witness to the traumas of herlife. \"When we tried to escape from the com-munist soldiers, they shot my baby in myarms and I had to leave it on the side of theroad,\" she said. \"I also saw them shoot mymother-in-law. They forced me to carryammunition and beat me, knocking out myteeth. I finally escaped and spent 15 years inrefugee camps. Now I live here with mysurviving children and we are very poor. Ifour benefits are cut, I don't know what wewill do, probably just starve.\" Several speakers complained about the difficulty of the citizenship exam, especially for the elderly. Yur Hang, a 66-year-old Vietnamese woman asked the lawmakers, \"If my benefitsare cut off before I become a citizen, whatwill happen to me?.\" Phon Not has already taken and failed the citizenship test three times. \"It is very hardfor me to study to become an Americancitizen,\" said the 72year-old Cambodian Alberto Puga, a migrant farm worker who testifiedin Spanish before a joint House and Senate hearingJan. 30, told lawmakers of the struggle his mentallyhandicapped daughter has had trying to become acitizen. He worries about what will happen to herwith the pending welfare cuts. \"It is very hard for me to study to become an American citizen. . . . I cannot understand when they talk to me. I go to school every day and study hard. I want to be an American citizen very much. \" \u2014Phon Not, a 72-year-old Cambodian woman5 February 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYwoman. \"I cannot understand when they talk to me. I go to school every day and studyhard. I want to be an American citizen verymuch.\" Judy Yellin of the Jewish Federation of Minneapolis' Resettlement Services said thatas many as 150 Russian Jewish immigrantsface the same problem. \"There are still manyfrail elderly who won't be able to pass thecitizenship test and will need some form of assistance,\" she said. \"We Somalis have run away from hell,\" Adam Amin Avil told the hearing. \"Backhome you can't walk the streets. The Somalicommunity here are many single-parentfamilies, widows with their children whoneed a handout. If they lose assistance, Godknows what will happen.\" Juanita Christiansen urged the lawmakers to consider the contributions of immigrants.\"I'm the daughter of immigrants. My par-ents came across from Mexico in 1912,\" shesaid. \"Our country is rich because of itsimmigrants. I have a son who is a doctor atthe Mayo Clinic. My daughter is a nurse. Myother daughter works for the MinneapolisSchool Board. It is time for you to see thatimmigrants get the justice they have coming,not charity.\" Transportation Any discussion of welfare reform is sure to include lofty calls to move people from wel-fare to work, but the street-level reality isthat such an effort will require some methodto transport people from their homes tojobs. The House Transportation and Transit Committee's Subcommittee on Transporta-tion Operations heard from a dozen stateand local officials from throughout the stateduring a Feb. 5 hearing on the implicationsof welfare reform. \"All the [job] training in the world doesn't mean anything if you're not there to use it,\"said Ramsey County Commissioner RafaelOrtega. \"We consider transit a critical com-ponent of welfare reform. We don't think it'sgoing to succeed without transit.\" So far, much of the discussion of reform has focused on removing barriers that pre-vent welfare recipients from seeking work.Child care, health care, and job training fre-quently rank as the top needs of people look- ing to move off the welfare rolls. The message from government officials serving both rural and urban areas is thattransportation should be included in thatlist of ingredients for effective reform. \"In order for welfare reform to succeed, people will need adequate transportation toand from jobs or postsecondary institutions,\"said Julie Aanenson, who supervises the Tri-Valley Heartland Express Transportation program in northwestern Minnesota. \"In rural Minnesota, these jobs and schools will be found in the larger communities andmany of the people needing these optionswill be located in smaller communities.\" The demand for public transit is expected to increase because many current welfarerecipients who will be forced into the jobmarket by recent federal changes simply can-not afford to own a car. They will need publictransit so they can bring their children to daycare and get to work. In rural areas, the problem is especially acute. Roughly 40 of the state's 87 countieshave no public transit system. In those thatdo, bus service is often very limited. For example, Aanenson's organization provides daily bus service in Thief RiverFalls, Minn., but buses run in-town routesonly two days per week in Crookston. In order to meet the demands of welfare reform, more buses will be needed and ser-vice will have to be expanded, Aanensonsaid. She also urged lawmakers to foster coop- erative efforts between organizations alreadyproviding transit services and to considerways to make more efficient use of existingresources. For example, Aanenson said, school buses could be put to better use during the longperiod of down time between the morningand afternoon commutes. Urban areas face different transportation concerns than do rural areas, but the needfor improvement is universal. In the Twin Cities, people moving from welfare to work may have a hard time find-ing a bus to take them where they need to go.The expected increase in demand for publictransit comes on the heels of MetropolitanCouncil Transit Operations (MCTO) farehikes and cutbacks in the number of busesrunning on metropolitan-area streets. The MCTO is hard pressed to meet the rise in reverse commuting, which bringsworkers from the core cities to the fast-developing business frontiers in first- andsecond-ring suburbs. \"If the jobs are at the Mall of America, we need to be able to take people from ourFrogtown neighborhood and get them to theMall of America,\" said Ramsey County Com-missioner Sue Haigh. \"We are going to needreliable transit and transportation to get thosefolks to work.\" Legislators were urged to provide more funding for bus service and to work withbusinesses to find other solutions such asshuttle services to and from the work site. \"We want to succeed with reforming wel- fare,\" Hennepin County Commissioner Pe-ter McLaughlin said. \"We need a transitsystem that allows us to do that.\" Session Weekly writers Steve Compton, K. Darcy Hanzlik, and Nick Healy contributed to this article. Ramsey County Commissioner Sue Haigh holds up a map with dots indicating the concentration ofwelfare recipients in Ramsey County. She testifiedFeb. 5 before the Transportation and TransitCommittee's Subcommittee on TransportationOperations.\"We want to succeed with reforming welfare. . . .

The editors6 SESSION WEEKLY / February 7, 1997CHILDREN DEVELOPMENT Kids in open court? Should juvenile court proceedings be open to the public? That's one of the questions the House Judiciary Committee explored Feb. 5 in ameeting with three top court officials. \"There is some disagreement among judges in the state. It's a time-honored prac-tice to keep those proceedings closed andconfidential,\" said John Stanoch, HennepinCounty District Court judge and presidingjudge in juvenile court. \"I'd like people tohave a better understanding of the difficultyof the decisions we make. Often the onlyscrutiny we get is when something horriblehappens, like when a child [who has hadsome contact with the system] dies.\" Under current law, juvenile court pro- ceedings are closed to the public, as are juve-nile court records. \"They probably should be opened, at least more than they are,\" Stanoch added. \"Thetime may have come for that to occur.\" Edward Toussaint, chief judge in the Min- nesota Court of Appeals, said the issue ispartly a matter of accountability: Wouldopening the proceedings undermine the pro-tection children deserve from the courts?Toussaint mentioned fears some have thatexposing the proceedings to the public couldviolate a child's need for privacy. The majority of members on a Minnesota Supreme Court Foster Care and AdoptionTask Force recommended, with qualifica-tions, that the proceedings be more open,Toussaint pointed out. \"This debate willcontinue,\" he said. \"It would be an advan-tage for the public to take a look at it.\" Also testifying was Sue Dosal, Minnesota Supreme Court administrator. \"This meeting was to inform the commit- tee,\" Skoglund said, \"but we ended up witha dialogue. Members are learning from them,and they [the court representatives] are hear-ing back. It was a very positive meeting.\" The meeting was one of a series the com- mittee has conducted with members of agen-cies affected by the committee's initiatives. Conventional expansion Legislators toured the Minneapolis Con- vention Center Feb. 4, where city officialspresented a $185 million plan that relies onstate financing to expand the facility.Members of the Senate's Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee joined severalrepresentatives from the House Commerce,Tourism and Consumer Affairs Committeeon the outing, hosted by Minneapolis CityCouncil Member Alice Rainville. Rainville,joined by fellow City Council Member JoanCampbell, told lawmakers that without theirhelp, the facility could not remain competi-tive in the increasingly cut-throat conven-tion market. Indeed, Campbell said, the convention center, which opened in 1990, has alreadyslipped in the national market from the 13thlargest facility in the country to 37th. \"We are a Minnesota resource,\" Rainville said, \"and we are simply asking the state tohave a role in the completion of the facility.\" The convention center's original plans included 500,000 square feet of display space.When then-Gov. Rudy Perpich vetoed statefunding in 1985, those plans were scaledback to the 280,000 square feet that existstoday. Minneapolis financed the effort with$350 million in bonds, a debt that will beretired in 2014. The city council members, along with rep- resentatives of the Minneapolis DowntownCouncil, presented an array of options forstate funding, including state-secured bonds,revenue authority bonds, and no less thanfive pay-as-you-go options. The cost of theexpansion, which would add dozens of meet-ing rooms in addition to the display space, isestimated at $185 million for the pay-as-you-go plan, or nearly $18 million annuallyfor 24 years if state-backed bonds are used.Supporters of the expansion maintain that Minneapolis cannot afford to shoulder thefiscal burden alone. In fact, the city has al-ready done its part by going into debt for theoriginal construction. To go further intodebt, Rainville said, would jeopardize thecity's AAA credit rating. \"Minneapolis can't do it on its own,\" Campbell said. \"Our businesses already havesome of the highest taxes and our competi-tors all have regional or state funding.\" City officials hope to find someone to introduce legislation in the near future. DWIMinneapolis Convention Center officials met with members of both the House and Senate commercecommittees to tour the facility Feb. 4. City officials presented a $185 million plan that relies on statefinancing to expand the facility. Drugged drivers Until last year, the police had no way to deal with drivers under the influence of ille-gal drugs. Often, a dangerous driver wouldtest negative for alcohol use and would haveto be released. \"The officers were getting into situations where they had to toss up their hands be-cause they didn't know what else to do,\" saidRep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) in testi-mony before the House JudiciaryCommittee's Judiciary Finance DivisionFeb. 6. So the 1996 Legislature made it \"illegal for citizens to drive an automobile . . . with anyamount of certain controlled includes most addictivenarcotics, stimulants, and depressants. Thepenalties the law are consistentwith the state's current DWI laws.7 February 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYEDUCATIONSCHOOL This year, Entenza would like the Legisla- ture to provide the funds to make enforce-ment possible. He and John Laux, executive director of the Peace Officers Standards and Training(POST) board, asked the committee to ap-prove $6.8 million annually to train and payfor drug recognition experts to be deployedthroughout the state. Entenza said the moneywould be used for 15 additional experts inthe seven-county metro area and 22 othersthroughout the state. Minneapolis and St.Paul have their own programs. \"The need was highlighted by the deaths of three people in 1995,\" Entenza said. \"Theywere killed by a man who had used illegaldrugs and rear-ended their car. They werepushed into a ditch and drowned.\" A fourth person was seriously injured. Entenza said the offender was difficult toprosecute because there was no drug recog-nition expert available at the scene. The 1996 law called for the POST board to develop a plan to train a \"sufficient\" numberof officers as Drug-Recognition Experts(DRE) to ensure they are available statewideeach day to evaluate suspected drug-impaireddrivers. The DRE funding request coincided with a report from Minnesota Department ofPublic Safety (DPS) that recommends ex-panding intensive probation programs forDWI offenders and continuing research tocombat the problem. \"Drunk drivers areMinnesota's most dangerous offenders.There's no doubt about that,\" said Don Davisof the DPS. Early school start The House passed a bill Feb. 6 that would allow school districts to begin classes beforeLabor Day in 1998 and 1999. The vote was123-9. Current state law forbids districts from opening schools before Labor Day. Thatmeasure, strongly supported by the state'sresort industry, has been on the books since1986. HF84 , sponsored by Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal), would allow school districtsto begin classes on the Wednesday, Thurs-day or Friday before Labor Day in 1998 an1999. According to Carlson, the bill came about because Labor Day falls relatively late inSeptember in 1998 (Sept. 7) and 1999(Sept. 6). Past efforts to change the law requiringschool to begin after Labor Day have at- tracted some controversy at the Capitol.Tourism groups have been the most vocaldefenders of the law, because it keeps avail-able the teenagers they rely upon to fill sea-sonal jobs, and it stretches the season forsummertime family vacations. Rep. Gail Skare (DFL-Bemidji) said the bill would be a \"hardship\" for northern Min-nesota resort owners who must make themost of a relatively short tourism season. \"That last week of the summer and the long weekend are vital to their businesses,\"Skare said during earlier debate on the bill. However, at least one major tourism in- dustry group is supporting HF84 . The legis- lation grew out of negotiations between theMinnesota Restaurant, Hotel & Resort As-sociation and the Minnesota School BoardsAssociation, according to Carlson. The bill now goes to the Senate. Irene McIfee, director of assessment for the St.Paul Public School District, testified Feb. 4 beforethe Quality Initiatives Subcommittee of theEducation Committee on a bill that would requireuniform standardized testing in all public schools.Statewide testing An effort to require uniform standardized testing in all public schools has taken a giantleap forward in the Senate. But it continuesto move by small steps in the House \u2014 atleast for now. In a somewhat unexpected move, the Sen- ate attached an amendment calling for state-wide testing to an important but non-con-troversial education bill. The bill(HF1*/SF3 ) would lift statutory caps on edu- cation spending that, if left in place, wouldforce a $337 million reduction in K-12 schoolfunding. It is uncertain how the House will respond to the Senate's action. House members couldconcur with the upper chamber and send thebill to the governor, or they could send themeasure to conference committee and workto get the statewide testing language alteredor removed from the bill. In the meantime, a House education sub- committee continues to deliberate the issueof statewide testing. \"Statewide assessment is not something you do on the fly,\" said Rep. Matt Entenza(DFL-St. Paul), who chairs the House Edu-cation Committee's Subcommittee on Qual-ity Initiatives. Proponents of statewide testing claim it would make schools more accountable byproviding an objective measurement of stu-dent performance and a reliable means forcomparing schools across district and statelines. Critics claim the testing would simply pit school districts against each other and couldhave a negative impact on students, poten-tially driving up dropout rates and specialeducation designations. Entenza's panel considered HF129 on Feb. 4, which calls for standardized testing ofMinnesota students in grades 3, 7, and 11. Bill sponsor Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud) said his legislation would do morethan provide fodder for criticism of strug-gling schools and districts. The bill, according to Opatz, would create a system that fosters improvement in schoolsthat are performing poorly and rewardsschools that are succeeding. Under the legislation, tests would be given to establish a baseline score for individualschools. Future performance at each schoolwould be measured against its own baseline. Schools that show improvement over their baseline would be rewarded by the state,which would direct funds to teachers at eachimproving site and give them authority todecide how the money can best be spent tobolster learning. Schools that do not show improvement \u2014 dubbed in the bill as \"schools in crisis\" \u2014also would receive financial assistance fromthe state. However, the funding would haveto be spent to develop and implement a planto improve learning. No action was taken on HF129 . Opatz's bill is one of several statewide testing pro-posals introduced this year. The education subcommittee earlier this8 SESSION WEEKLY / February 7, 1997 ENVIRONMENT GAMBLINGsession discussed a separate proposal to re- quire statewide testing. That bill ( HF235 ), sponsored by Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer (R-Princeton), consists of Gov. Arne Carlson'sprescription for standardized testing in allpublic schools. (See Jan. 31, 1997, Session Weekly , page 5.) No action has been taken on the Koppendrayer bill. Lottery funding stalls A bill to extend the dedication of state lottery revenue for the environment ( HF113 ) stalled Feb. 6 in the House Environment andNatural Resources Finance Committee. Bill sponsor Rep. Willard Munger (DFL- Duluth) wants 40 percent of net lottery pro-ceeds to continue funding environmentalprojects until 2050. Under the MinnesotaConstitution, that dedication is set to expirein the year 2000. But after testimony from Munger and members of the Environmental Trust FundCoalition, a debate over two amendments toHF113 has left its future uncertain. Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul), chair of the panel, offered an amendment to extendthe lottery fund's dedication to 2020, argu-ing that by then the trust fund would havemore than $1 billion in assets, according tocurrent financial projections. The $1 billionfigure was the original goal for the funddiscussed by state lawmakers, said Osthoff.If allowed to continue until 2050, projec-tions show the fund would be worth $5.9billion. \"I think it is irresponsible for legisla-tors to tie up this [lottery] money for 50years into the future,\" Osthoff said. Members approved the 2020 sunset date after Munger failed in attempts to lengthenit to 2040 and 2030. Over Munger's objections, the panel also approved an amendment by Rep. PhyllisKahn (DFL-Mpls) to allow up to 25 percentof the annual revenues deposited in the en-vironmental fund to be used for land acqui-sition and development until 2020. Munger'soriginal bill would have authorized such ex-penditures only through fiscal year 1997.Kahn argued that since land prices increaseover time, it makes more sense to buy prop-erty as early as possible. \"The best use of thetrust fund is to accumulate public land,\"Kahn said. Munger, who had asked legislators to ap- prove this bill without amendments, wasvisibly upset, and argued that the Kahnamendment would allow legislators to dipinto dedicated environmental dollars every year for pet projects. \"You are getting thetrust fund from both ends,\" Munger told thecommittee. \"First you take away 30 years offunding and now you want to lower theamount by 25 percent.\" Greta Hesse Gauthier, director of the En- vironmental Trust Fund Coalition, told thecommittee her organization's board of di-rectors also opposed the change. Munger then withdrew the bill, bringing discussion on the proposal to a sudden halt.It is unclear whether HF113 will be debated further. Revenue pay dirt Minnesota gamblers spent nearly $376 million on numbers games and scratch-offtickets in 1996 \u2014 the highest sales total yet,the Minnesota State Lottery' s director saidFeb. 5. And that number could have beenlarger. \"The blizzards hurt us a great deal,\" Di- rector George Andersen told members of theHouse Regulated Industries and EnergyCommittee's Subcommittee on Gambling.\"We lost about a million dollars a week.\" As it was, he said, 1996 sales were up more than 10 percent, with instant games account-ing for nearly three-quarters of gross rev-enues. Powerball sales, he continued,slumped dramatically during that period,adding that the Daily Millions game intro-duced last September has yet to produce itsfirst big-prize winner. Three-year-old Taylor Ireland plays with his toy cars as his mother, Jessica, a welfare recipientfrom Northfield, holds a sign with his picture on it. Several demonstrators gathered outside ajoint House and Senate hearing Feb. 4 as lawmakers took testimony on impending welfare cuts.Andersen presented the sales numbers during his annual appearance, mandated bylaw, before the legislative committee. Healso detailed the state's piece of the action. The lottery, Andersen said, returned al- most $90 million to the state last year. Thatmoney, for the most part, went into thegeneral fund and the Environment and Natu-ral Resources Trust Fund. In general, hecontinued, the financial statements have notvaried much since the game's inception in1990. He went on about the notion that Minnesota's lottery somehow competes withIndian casinos for gambling dollars. Theidea, he said, is not true, adding that theincreased sales figures bear him out. \"We're retail,\" he said, \"not a destina- tion.\" In presenting the numbers, Andersen placed the game in a historical context. Theconcept, he said, is ancient. For example, theGreat Wall of China was built with lotteryproceeds and European history is full ofreferences to lotteries. In the United States, people have enjoyed lottery action from the earliest days, evenduring the Revolutionary era, although thegames in that time were privately run. Infact, Anderson said, Thomas Jefferson him-self operated a numbers game. The federal government, he said, banned lotteries in the 1850s and they did not reap-pear, legally, until New Hampshire intro-duced its sweepstakes in 1964. Other statesquickly realized the revenue potential andcreated their own lotteries \u2014 althoughAndersen himself remained skeptical. \"I remember hearing on the radio . . . in9 February 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYHEALTHGAME & FISH1972 that Pennsylvania had passed the lot- tery, and I thought it would never have achance, that it would never succeed,\" hesaid. \"I stand corrected.\" Feeding the deer Winter deer feeding costs the state too much in money and staff time and doesn'tsave enough deer to make it worthwhile,according to a preliminary report presentedto the House Environment and Natural Re-sources Committee Jan. 4. The report, pre-sented by Tim Bremicker, chief of the De-partment of Natural Resources' (DNR) Di-vision of Wildlife, evaluated the state's 1996Emergency Deer Feeding Program. Deer feeding supporters argue that the report failed to take public support intoaccount. \"The DNR doesn't realize the number of $1.5 mil- lion for an emergency deer feeding programfunded with a $2.50 surcharge on huntinglicenses. \"Everything in life isn't about biol-ogy,\" he said. \"Sometimes government hasto respond to the wishes of people.\" Bakk also sponsored a 1996 law that marked $750,000 in emergency deer feedingfunds. In 1996, the DNR spent a total of$975,713 to provide 5,115 tons of feed. (Themoney came from a portion of the proceedsfrom hunting and fishing licenses, not gen-eral taxpayer revenue.) The 1996 project involved 8,300 volun- teer distributors spreading food at 9,150 sitesover an area of 38,000 square miles. About23 percent more deer were reached in 1996than a similar effort in 1989. According to the report, deer feeding is not effective in preventing widespread lossesof deer during severe winters. Other findingsinclude facts such as: more than 8,000 hours of staff time wentinto the feeding program; deer populations declined an average of 27percent in areas where feeding occurred in1996; the cost to provide an adequate ration to 50percent of the herd would have been $2.3million, more than twice as much as the 1996expenditure; and no other state or province pays for emer-gency deer feeding, although there are nu-merous private efforts. The report also raises what it terms seriousbiological concerns. \"Deer feeding unnatu- rally concentrates deer, leading to increasedsusceptibility to predation, transmission ofdisease and parasites, and impacts to naturalbrowse and vegetation . There are also po- tential long-term consequences of feedingon deer movements, habitat use, and theoverall health of the deer herd.\" The report recommends that the state de- velop policies \"to determine whether deerfeeding should be included as part of futurestate deer management programs and if so,what the goals of future programs should beand strategies for meeting those goals.\" Joe Wood, executive director of the 18,000- member Minnesota Deer Hunters Associa-tion, sees a different message in the DNRreport. The 1996 study shows that 23 percentof the deer in northern Minnesota werereached by the feeding program. That is anincrease from 11 percent from the 1989 feed-ing. \"It shows a substantial improvementfrom 1989,\" Wood said. \"Is the efficiency ofdeer feeding comparably as good as any-thing else the DNR does?\" he asked. In the end, the committee decided to send HF167 on to the Environment and Natural Resources Finance Committee without mak-ing a recommendation. A hearing is expectedon the proposal next week. Reducing teenage smoking After nearly four hours of debate, the House of Representatives granted prelimi-nary passage Feb. 6 to a bill aimed at reduc-ing teenage smoking. The vote was 128-0. Lawmakers approved a dramatically al- tered version of HF117 that hits store own- ers with fines for the first time, but no longerincludes annual \"sting\" operations to ensurecompliance. As approved, HF117 , sponsored by Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), would requirelocal governments to license establishmentsthat sell tobacco. It also would slap storeowners with a $50 fine should a clerk sellsmokes to an underage buyer. Fines for arepeat offense increase to $150, and a thirdviolation within two years would cause thestore to lose its license to sell tobacco for atleast a week. The bill also adds civil fines forclerks who sell to those who are underage. Essentially, the bill fills a gap in Minnesota's existing tobacco regulation, Rest said. \"The current law does not involve thestores,\" Rest said. \"Our bill . . . brings the stores into the circle of responsibility.\" Under current law, clerks who sell to- bacco to minors can face criminal penaltiesof up to a year in jail and a $3,000 fine, butthe store owner faces no penalties \u2014 civil orcriminal. But HF117 does provide room for a rebut- tal on the part of clerks and proprietors. Rest herself introduced an amendment, adopted by voice vote, that allows penaltiesto be waived if the accused \"could not rea-sonably have known that the conduct wasunlawful.\" Such a situation could involvethe use of a fake identification card. Another amendment, offered by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) and approvedby a 70-62 vote, would let store owners selltobacco products from self-serve displays, aslong as the fixtures are within the sight line ofan employee. As introduced, the bill prohib-ited self-serve displays altogether. Propo-nents wanted to remove easy access to ciga-rettes. Opponents called the move an unnec-essary burden on businesses. Many lawmakers expressed dismay that HF117 apparently provides tougher sanc- tions for everyone culpable in underagesmoking, except for the lawbreakers them-selves. Several representatives offered amend-ments to remedy that shortcoming, includ-ing one from Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-LakeCity) that would have slapped a $1,000 fineon teens caught trying to buy a pack ofsmokes. (Under current law, underage to-bacco possession or use is a petty misde-meanor, which carries a top fine of $200.) Ultimately, an amendment sponsored by Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) wasadopted. It requires an alternative to the finesystem. Store owners, parents, and othersperipherally involved in an underage to-bacco purchase would collaborate to con-sider developing an education program onthe hazards of smoking or examine commu-nity service as an option in lieu of a fine. Legislators reserved what was perhaps their most passionate debate for an amendmentby Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester), whichwas approved by a 66-62 margin. The amend-ment deleted a provision requiring commu-nities to conduct at least one sting operationper year in each establishment licensed tosell tobacco. \"Are we that suspicious of our citizens?\" Bishop asked, adding that law enforcementofficials should have at least probable causebefore engaging in undercover compliancechecks. \"This is a terrible precedent.\" A final vote on HF117 is expected Feb. 10.10 SESSION WEEKLY / February 7, 1997HIGHER EDUCATION INDUSTRY During a celebration of Minnesota National Girls and Women in Sports Day, Briana Kennedy- Coker, left, and Clyde Lund performed a segment of the play \"Tomboy Stone\" Feb. 6 in the Capitol rotunda. This play, currently running at the Great American History Theater in St. Paul, is a storyabout the first woman to play big league baseball \u2014 St. Paul's Marcenia Toni \"Tomboy\" StoneAlberga. Briana plays the part of Stone as a young girl who had to convince the men in power tolet her play with the boys.Regent selection Legislators are about to begin the process of choosing from 12 finalists for five seats onthe University of Minnesota Board ofRegents. The House Education Committee received a briefing Feb. 6 on the regent selectionprocess and on the final steps slated to takeplace this month. The 12-member Board of Regents includes one person representing each of Minnesota'seight congressional districts and four at-large members, including one U of M stu-dent (who is a student at the time of elec-tion). Regents serve six-year terms that are stag- gered so that four seats come up for electionby the Legislature in each odd-numberedyear. Five seats are available this year becauseof the October 1996 resignation of RegentJean Keffler. (Gov. Arne Carlson appointedMichael O'Keefe to temporarily fill Keffler'sseat, and O'Keefe is now seeking election toserve the remainder of a term set to expire in2001.) The 12 finalists were selected by the Re- gent Candidate Advisory Council, a panelcreated in 1988 to screen candidates for theboard. Ninety-one candidates applied forthe open seats this year, and 23 of them wereinterviewed by the advisory council.Three major steps remain in the regent selection process. First, nominees will be reviewed by a cau- cus of all legislators from the appropriatecongressional district. Caucus members willvote to endorse one candidate. Congres-sional caucus meetings are expected to takeplace during the week of Feb. 10-14. Next, the House and Senate education committees will meet jointly Feb. 18 to con-sider the advisory council recommendationsand the caucus endorsements. Committeemembers will vote to endorse five candi-dates, whose names will be submitted to thefull Legislature as a slate. Finally, the full House and Senate will convene jointly in the House Chamber Feb.27 to elect the regents. Lawmakers can votethe slate or choose from others among the 12finalists. A majority of the 201 members ofthe House and Senate must approve anynomination to the board. Here's a look at the finalists in the five congressional districts with open seats. First District: Bryan Neel, an incumbent regent and a doctor at Rochester's MayoClinic. Thomas Stoa, Winona, a doctor prac-ticing in La Crosse, Wis. Fourth District: Andrew Boss, St. Paul, chair of the board for St. Anthony Park State Bank.Carol Erickson, Roseville, superintendent ofthe Roseville School District. David Metzen,superintendent of the South St. Paul School District. Fifth District: Michael O'Keefe, an incum- bent regent and executive vice president ofthe McKnight Foundation. William Drake,Minneapolis, president and chief executiveofficer of Islet Technology Inc. Sixth District: George Allen, Woodbury, re- tired 3M senior vice president. BarbaraKlemme, Stillwater, consultant fornonprofits. Maureen Reed, Stillwater, a doc-tor director forcontracted care. Seventh District: Bob Bergland, Roseau, former secretary of agriculture under Presi-dent Jimmy Carter. Herbert Chilstrom, Peli-can Rapids, a retired presiding bishop of theEvangelical Lutheran Church in America. Subterranean jungle There's much more to the streets of Min- nesota than meets the eye. Countless miles oflines and cables run beneath the pavement,all carrying services for water, electricity,sewer, natural gas, telephones, and cabletelevision. The underground has become even busier in recent years with the advent of new tech-nologies and new uses for the technology,such as those for telephones. The result?Increased demand for limited space. Looking for ways to manage competing public and commercial interests, membersof the House Regulated Industries and En-ergy Committee have been meeting withmunicipal and industry authorities to talkabout how access to the ground below publicstreets should be managed. The committee heard Feb. 4 from city officials and engineers who said the situa-tion has gotten out of hand. Streets are being torn up more than ever before and often are left with substandardrepairs. New lines and cables are competingfor space, and new installations make it hardfor public works employees to reach existingutility lines. \"We're fighting all the other utilities when we want to plan work,\" said Leonard Krummof the City Engineers Association of Minne-sota (CEAM) and an assistant director ofpublic works for the city of Minneapolis. \"At11 February 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYTAXES $ times, we can't even get to our water mains. The telecommunication lines are all out ofproportion.\" \"It's a utilities right-of-way management issue,\" added John Maczko, also of CEAMand an engineer for the city of St. Paul.\"Cities need to have a say in how to manageit.\" Most agree that the new technologies are desirable and in demand. Representativesfrom the telephone industry said they'd likethe Legislature to enact a statewide policy onbelow-ground rights-of-way. Currently,what little control that exists is shared bymunicipalities and the Public Utilities Com-mission. \"Everyone who uses the right-of-way should share the burden of costs. It has to beproportionate,\" said Jerry Knickerbocker,director of the Minnesota Telephone Asso-ciation. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), com- mittee chair, has authored a bill addressingrights-of-way concerns. \"The bill does threethings,\" Jennings said. \"It provides and es-tablishes absolute authority on the part ofcities to determine rights-of-way; it allowscities to recover actual costs for access [byothers]; and it provides that access is not arevenue source for cities.\" The bill ( HF322 ), however, has not yet received a hearing. While Jennings expectsthe bill's three major provisions to remainintact, he also expects other changes willoccur during committee discussion. Further consideration of the issue is ex- pected in the near future. Arthur Rolnik, an economist from the MinneapolisFederal Reserve Bank, listened to a question froma member of the Taxes Committee Feb. 6. Thehearing dealt with the increasing demand fromprivate businesses that state and local governmentssubsidize them to better the job climate. Public handouts About 130 years ago, Americans fought the Civil War, the bloodiest conflict thiscountry has ever seen. Now, in the face ofdizzying technological advancements, thestates are once again at each other's throats\u2014 but instead of bullets, the public tax dollaris the weapon of choice. Increasingly, Federal Reserve Bank econo- mist Arthur Rolnick told the House TaxesCommittee Feb. 6, state and local govern-ments have turned to subsidizing privatebusinesses with public money in an effort togenerate economic development. Indeed, ascompanies have become more mobile,they've started to press governments to offersubsidies or risk losing their business \u2014 andjobs.The effect, Rolnick said, has been to pit state against state and city against city ascorporations seek the best tax deal. More-over, he continued, a strong argument canbe made that the anticipated benefits rarely,if ever, emerge. \"No one's overturned Adam Smith's 'in- visible Rolnick said, invoking theScottish political philosopher whose \"Wealthof Nations\" became the bible of the free-market economy. \"But Adam Smith's theo-ries don't apply to competition among gov-ernments.\" Economic competition, in and of itself, is not bad, Rolnick explained, it is just that onemust distinguish between private and publicgoods. If a state wants to create a pro-busi-ness climate, then certainly that state canreap the benefits as firms relocate to takeadvantage. However, Rolnick said, whengovernments start to offer specific subsidiesto lure particular businesses \u2014 that kind ofcompetition can be debilitating. For example, he said, Alabama, hoping to create an industrial base, enticed Mercedes-Benz to open a plant there by ceding thecompany tens of millions of dollars in taxes.From an Alabaman perspective, the movemay have been worth the cost. But from anational perspective, the economy most defi-nitely took a hit. \"Because we allowed the states to bid,these states gave up some revenue,\" Rolnick said. \"By playing this game nationally, youend up with less revenue.\" Mercedes would have located in the U.S. anyway, so there was no economic develop-ment and no net job creation by virtue of thesubsidy, Rolnick said. What's more, otherbusinesses in Alabama need to pay moretaxes to recover the share not paid byMercedes. Obviously, Rolnick said, no government will unilaterally remove itself from the com-petition. Such a move would be too costly.The obvious solution, he said, is to haveCongress apply the Constitution's interstatecommerce clause and tax \u2014 as income \u2014public subsidies. \"Congress does have the authority . . . they should use it,\" Rolnick said. \"If you're aprivate company and you're able to get pref-erential treatment . . . you should have todeclare it as income. . .and the IRS should taxit at a very high rate. I'd prefer 100 percent.The game would be over.\" If you have Internet access, visit the Legislature's web page at: http://www.leg.state.mn.usNOTES Property taxes, as most legislators know , can arouse the strongest of emotions in eventhe most staid individuals \u2014 particularlyaround assessment time. During the courseof the Taxes Committee's Property Tax andTax Increment Finance Division's Feb. 5meeting, an overview of the assessment pro-cess prompted Rep. Edwina Garcia (DFL-Richfield), who served on a local tax appealboard, to recall an incident where the proce-dure proved lethal. \"I remember one man who was just sitting there and he just keeled over \u2014 and he wasgone,\" Garcia said of one appellant whodidn't live to pay the tax. \"I know it takesCatholics a long time to get over somethinglike that. I felt responsible.\"12 SESSION WEEKLY / February 7, 1997Within the past few weeks, several different wel-fare bills have begun tospring up around the StateCapitol and although Housemembers have yet to debatethem, it is expected that something based on the governor's proposalwill survive. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) is spon- soring two welfare bills, one of which(HF161 ) encompasses much of what Gov. Arne Carlson and the Department of Hu-man Services would like. Jennings cautioned, however, that the bill is \"very fluid\" and open to changes. States across the country are hurrying to pass new welfare laws after the federal gov-ernment scrapped the long-standing welfaresystem in August 1996. The federal law does away with monthly welfare checks and food stamps for manylegal immigrants and eliminates disabilitycash assistance for people with drug andalcohol addictions. It also eliminates cashassistance for children with certain behav-ioral disabilities and requires able-bodiedadults, ages 18-50, who receive food stampsto work. Perhaps the most significant change in- volves poor families with children. The lawrequires these parents to get a job and sets afive-year-lifetime limit on their welfare ben-efits. States that do not move these parents towork will be penalized by the federal govern-ment. While the federal law prescribes some of what states are required to do, it leaves eachstate to decide how to design its own welfaresystem. Below are some of the highlights of HF161 . The bill, as it stands now, would: Set a five-year lifetime limit on receiving welfare benefits. This is in keeping with thenew federal law. Mandate a 30-day residency requirement to receive welfare and require that, for thefirst year, families who move to Minnesotareceive either the benefit amount theywould have received in their previous state,or Minnesota's rate, whichever is less. Beginning Jan. 1, 1998, expand a statewide welfare pilot program that requires poorfamilies to work if they want public assis-tance. The Minnesota Family InvestmentProgram (MFIP) is expected to becomeA bill for an act ating to civil actions; modifying and expanding rovisions for sanctions in civil actions; Statutes subdivision 6; and 609.5314, subdivision 3; proposing coding for new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 549; repealing Minnesota Statutes 1994, section 549.21. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE THE STATE OF MINNESOTA :ARTICLE 1 SANCTIONS IN CIVIL ACTIO 1 [549.211] [ SANCTION ACTIONS]vil acti or sanctions reform . . . Proposals introduced to respond to federal changes the state's answer to the tough new federal welfare law. MFIP allows families to accept lower pay- ing jobs while receiving some public assis-tance, such as extra monthly cash and subsi-dized child and health care. In theory, allow-ing someone to work while still receivingbenefits helps a low-skilled parent gain workexperience and eventually obtain a betterjob. Under the proposal, two-parent families statewide would be required to work imme-diately to receive welfare benefits. Single-parent families would be required to workwithin six months of receiving assistance.Parents who don't meet the deadline to workwill, at first, have their welfare benefits cut by25 percent. Families face an additional 10percent cut for each work deadline they miss. Under MFIP, parents would leave welfare when their income reaches 120 percent ofthe poverty level which, for a family of three,is about $16,000. The bill also creates statewide employ- ment and training services for welfare re-cipients who are now required to work. Un-der the governor's proposal, the state is ex-pected to spend less per person on employ-ment and training services than it currentlyspends per person in the several countiesthat have experimented with MFIP for thepast two years. In all, the governor recommends $17.8 million in fiscal year 1998 and $28.4 millionin fiscal year 1999 to pay for MFIP. Thegovernor has said that the cost of MFIP willcost the state no more than its old welfaresystem. In addition, the governor's proposal would: Allow legal immigrants on U.S. soil at the time the federal law was signed to be eli-gible for Medical Assistance. The federallaw gives states the option of denying thoseindividuals coverage. The law does barimmigrants who arrived after Aug. 22, 1996,(the date the federal law was signed), fromreceiving Medical Assistance for five years.But, the governor's proposal would offerthe benefit to certain legal immigrants inthat group. The state would use its ownmoney to pay for them. Allow legal immigrants on U.S. soil at the time the federal law was signed to be eli-gible for MFIP. Again the federal law givesstates the option of denying those indi-viduals coverage. The federal law does pre- vent immigrants who arrived after Aug. 22,1996, from receiving MFIP. But, thegovernor's proposal would offer the ben-efit to legal immigrants. Again, the statewould use its own money to pay for them. Require that the income of a legal immigrant's American sponsor be consid-ered when determining eligibility for pub-lic assistance of any kind. Tap into the rental subsidies of some fami- lies on welfare. Specifically, the bill wouldcount $100 of a welfare recipient's rentalsubsidy as part of their income, thus po-tentially reducing their overall welfare ben-efit. This provision helps pay to expandMFIP statewide but it has been criticized asshuffling benefits from one poor person tohelp another. Eliminate a $50 payment to those on wel- fare who are owed child support. When asingle parent is owed child support andapplies for welfare, he or she must agree toallow the state and federal government tokeep a part of any child support collectedto compensate for the welfare payments.Under the old federal law, states were re-quired to pass on the first $50 collectedeach month to the family. The new federallaw no longer requires states to do that. Limit to one year the amount of postsecondary education a person on wel-fare can receive while preparing for work.Jennings said this provision in particular isopen for discussion. Some careers mayrequire two years of schooling but offerbetter pay, thus helping to move people offwelfare for good. Eliminate the $1,500 cap on the value of a welfare recipient's vehicle. Many arguedthat the low value too often meant unreli-able transportation and could cost peopletheir jobs. Provide special citizenship training to help more legal immigrants pass the U.S. citi-zenship test. \u2014 K.

The idea for hissuccessful board game Sequence came tohim in a dream. Another long-time dream came true when he wassworn in as the state rep-resentative for District28A. \"I dream a lot,\" Reuter said. \"I keep paper andpencil by my bedside towrite down ideas forproducts or services orsolutions to problems that come to me.\" He woke up from a particularly vivid dream in 1974 with the full blown idea for his boardgame, he said. \"I worked on it off and on forthe next two years. Then, it sat in my closetuntil 1981 when I sold the rights to manufac-ture and distribute it to Jax [a New Hope-based game company].\" With no advertising, the game \"didn't do much for the first 12 years,\" Reuter said.\"But in the last three years, it has really takenoff and sales are now at about one and aquarter million copies.\" In November 1995,Reuter quit his job as human resources di-rector for Owatonna exercise equipmentmanufacturer Cybex to devote his full atten-tion to marketing the game. Reuter, 47, was born in Superior, Wis., but grew up in the Twin Cities area. His parentseventually settled in New Hope where theyare now retired. After high school, Reuter joined the U.S. Navy, where he met and married his wife,Nancy, while stationed in Seattle. They nowNew members . . . Reuter not playing games with fiscal restraint have three children, the oldest of whom is asenior at Owatonna High School. Chippingaway at college courses at Metro State Uni-versity, Reuter eventually received his de-gree in business administration in 1991. Heworked in the field of human resources for22 years, including his stint in the Navy andfive years as an independent consultant. He was first exposed to the legislative pro- cess as a lobbyist for Reuter, Inc., a wastemanagement firm founded by his uncle. Inthe 1980s, the company was pushing recy-cling, composting and refuse-derived fuel asan alternative to landfills and mass incinera-tion. Reuter made presentations before theMetropolitan Council, Legislature, city coun-cils, and county boards, and eventually lob-bied in 30 states. \"I am proud of the fact that, as a direct result of my efforts, we have many fewermass incineration facilities in this countrythan we would have had,\" Reuter said. Now, as a legislator, he sits on the other side of the desk. \"As a lobbyist, I had theeasier job,\" Reuter said. \"Now I'm respon-sible for actually making laws.\" Reuter's first exposure to party politics was as a Republican activist in Eden Prairie,where he and his family lived for 18 years.There, he ran for city council in 1982 and1984 and for mayor in 1986. He lost all threeraces, but stayed active in the RepublicanParty, serving as a local officer and statedelegate. After moving to Owatonna, Reuter was offered a position on the executive commit-tee of the Steele County Republicans in March1996. The following month, incumbent Re-publican Rep. Gary Worke announced that he would not seek re-election. Reuter quicklydecided to run for the seat. \"Education, crime, the stadium, and wel- fare reform were the top issues during thecampaign,\" Reuter said. \"The proposedTwins stadium is the number one issue thatI have heard about since. Virtually none ofmy constituents favor public funding of thestadium.\" Since the election, another concern has emerged in Owatonna: property taxes. Loststate aid school funding and a $29 millionschool bond referendum \"combined to pro-duce a large property tax increase, some ashigh as 200 percent,\" he said. The answer is to control spending, he said. \"Coming from the private sector, there is noautomatic 4 or 6 percent increase in spend-ing every year. It's tighten your belt, increaseproduction while decreasing spending. Weneed to bring that attitude to government.\" \u2014 Steve Compton District 28A Top concern: \"Since the election, property taxes have become a huge issue in Owatonna. The schooldistrict lost state aid funding, and at the same time,a property tax increase was kicking in for a $29million school bond referendum. Those two com-bined to produce a large tax property increase,some as high as 200 percent.\" \u2014Rep. Doug ReuterRep.

Ruth Johnson (DFL-St. Peter), several of life's turning points have pivotedaround Gustavus Adolphus College. Her fa-ther was a Gustavus student when she was born. After growing upin Nebraska, where herfather was a Lutheranpastor, she, also,attended her under-graduate work. Then,after receiving hermaster's degree fromIndiana University, and working in various other places, she returnedagain to become the associate dean of stu-dents at Gustavus. Now as a newly elected member of the House, Johnson has taken a leave of absencefrom her duties at the college to devote herfull attention to the five-month legislativesession. She is also negotiating with Gustavusto reduce her workload for the remainder ofthe year so that she can attend town meetingsand respond to constituent calls and letters. As a child, Johnson remembers herself as a patriotic Girl Scout and a Republican sym-pathizer. \"How could you be against Presi-dent Eisenhower?\" In high school, she sup-ported Barry Goldwater. \"By the time I was21, I voted for Hubert Humphrey,\" she said. Like millions of other baby boomers, Johnson's political conversion took place incollege around opposition to the VietnamWar. \"I was involved in the anti-war move-ment at Gustavus and became friends ofsome of the guys in VVAW (Vietnam Veter-New members . . . Johnson brings strong focus on children, education ans Against the War) in graduate school,\"Johnson said. \"Those were extremely shap-ing political movements for me. I recognizedthat we needed a change in our governmentand that the change would come from citi-zen involvement.\" More practical political experience was to follow. She stayed on at Indiana Universityafter graduate school to work in an experi-mental social justice program run by theRoger Williams Foundation. Later, while liv-ing and working in Kansas, Johnson volun-teered on a congressional campaign whereshe \"got an idea of what grassroots cam-paigning was all about.\" She also served onthe Kansas Democratic Party's state affirma-tive action committee. All of her previous political experience came into play last summer when formerDFL Rep. Don Ostrom announced that hewould not seek re-election in District 24B.After being encouraged by DFL party mem-bers, she decided to enter the race. \"I had tohit the ground running in the middle of Juneand put a campaign together on very shortnotice,\" Johnson said. \"My district is typical small-town Minne- sota,\" Johnson said. It includes parts of Nic-ollet, Le Sueur, and Blue Earth counties. Thelargest town is Mankato. \"People areconcerned about kids,\" she said. \"And thefirst place they look is education. That's per-fect for me.\" On her arrival at the Capitol, Johnson immediately joined in working on one edu-cation-related issue that is close to her heart.She and Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville)are sponsoring an anti-hazing bill. If passed, the new law would explicitly prohibit stu-dent hazing. Such unofficial student initia-tions have become traditions on some highschool and college campuses. Hazings aretypically humiliating and painful for the ini-tiates and have occasionally resulted in in-jury and death. \"About two-thirds of the states have laws on the books against hazing,\" Johnson said.\"Minnesota does not.\" Much of the behavior involved in hazing is already illegal, Johnson said. But it is oftendifficult to prosecute or gain damages be-cause, in most cases, the victim has con-sented to the hazing. \"Our bill would re-move consent as a defense. We also want toeducate young people to realize that theirlegitimate desire to belong or go through arite of passage can involve challenge but notrisk. It was very helpful to us at Gustavus toput the word 'hazing' in our student conductcode,\" Johnson said. \u2014Steve Compton 1996 population: Location: south central Minnesota Top concern: \"People are concerned about kids and the first place they look is education. Thereare also concerns about property taxes andabout finding better paying job opportunitiesfor young people so that they won't all moveaway.\" \u2014Rep. Ruth JohnsonRep.

NOTES When the Department of Administra- tion presented its budget request to the Gov- ernmental Operations Committee's StateGovernment Finance Division Feb. 5, theyasked for funding to hire additional staff toinspect the thousands of elevators scatteredthroughout Minnesota. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) asked the administration spokesman if any of thosenew inspectors would be stationed in ruralMinnesota. \"Do they have elevators in rural Minne- sota?\" asked Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls),provoking laughter from the committee. \"I thought you were going to ask if they went all the way to the top,\" said Rep. JimFarrell (DFL-St. Paul). While this winter's bitter cold and record snowfall have recently given way to balmytemperatures in the 30s, some state officialsaren't necessarily looking forward to springthaws.\"It is very difficult for me to study for citizenship,\" said Yur Hang. The elderly Viet-namese woman was testifying Jan. 30 beforeSenate and House lawmakers looking at howfederal welfare cuts will affect legal immi-grants. \"Even the senators and representa-tives of Minnesota, I don't know,\" she ad-mitted, gesturing toward the committees. Sen. John Hottinger quickly responded, \"Let me assure you that you are not the onlyone here who doesn't know who we are.\"In recent testimony before the House Ju- diciary Committee, Jim Franklin, director ofemergency management for the Departmentof Public Safety, explained his rather grimduties: \"We're the people who spend all theirtime considering natural disasters.\" Currently, Franklin said, his department is planning for projected spring floods. Giventhe high water content of the packed snownow in huge drifts throughout Minnesota \u2014and in southwestern Minnesota in particu-lar \u2014 winter's end could spell trouble.None of the accounting software pro- grams used throughout the vast network ofstate offices knows what to make of the digits\"00\" when used to signify a year \u2014 such asthe year 2000. Nor can they accommodate afour-digit year code. The legislative auditor's office on Feb. 6 told members of the House GovernmentalOperations Committee that new softwaremust be purchased for the government tocontinue to function. Millions of transac-tions will become impossible, such as writ-ing paychecks, paying Medicare and Medic-aid bills, or paying vendors. \"The problem touches on virtually every business transaction the state has,\" said Leg-islative Auditor Jim Nobles. \"The state needs$25 million currently not appropriated torewrite the computer code to accommodatedates in the 21st century. The state's businessdepends on this problem being solved.\" It seems the government's only option regards when, not whether, it will solve whathas come to be known as \"the year 2000problem.\"21 February 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Coming Up Next Week . . .

Feb. 6 - 13, 1997 Highlights In the wake of recent tragedies involving high speeds, snowmobiles, and innocentchildren, state lawmakers are exploring possible solutions to an increasing winterproblem. Stacy Schlosser, 15, and Joshua Renken, 10, are among the record-tying 26 Minneso-tans killed in snowmobile-related accidentsthis season. Their parents brought the heart-wrenching stories of their children's deathsto the House Environment and Natural Re-sources Committee Feb. 12, where the panelapproved two bills to further regulatesnowmobiling. \"Do you know what it is like to have to look at an empty chair at the supper tableevery night?\" Jan Schlosser tearfully askedcommittee members. Schlosser's daughter,Stacy, was killed while walking with her twinsister, Sonia, and some friends on Dec. 22near East Bethel, Minn. Schlosser said that a lot of people say that the problem is mostly with youngersnowmobilers. \"But the man who hit Stacywas 42 years old, had been in a bar, and wasgoing down 183rd Ave. at 80 miles per hour. \"The fact that the state does not require licensing, training [for adults], or insuranceis just incredible,\" she said. \"I'm not trying to say 'let's ban snowmobiles.' But there are a few snowmobilers who must be stopped.\" Lori Renken of Big Lake, Minn., was sob- bing as she described the death of her 10-year-old son, Joshua, who was killed lastmonth while crossing the street in front ofhis home. \"It's only been three weeks andI'm in a lot of anger right now,\" Renkenbegan. \"I don't know how to shop for gro-ceries anymore. I went shopping yesterdayand I'm still buying the things Josh liked.\" Renken said that the man who hit her sonSnowmobile tragedies . . . Lawmakers aim to make snowmobiles, trails safer was 20 years old and also had been drinkingbefore the accident. The man had a previousconviction for driving under the influence.\"Not every road leads to a bar. But if you pickup a snowmobile map, you will see thatmany of the trails lead to bars,\" she said. Both mothers urged legislators to enact tougher laws regulating snowmobiling.Schlosser called for the nighttime speed limit to be lowered from 50 to 30 miles per hour. \"Please, please pay attention,\" Renkenpleaded. HF406 , sponsored by Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison), addresses many of the con-cerns of both mothers. The proposal, unanimously approved by the committee,would mandate that allsnowmobilers take a state-approved safetycourse before they can ride. Current lawonly requires those under 18 to take thecourse before riding on state trails and wa-ters. The bill also would require all snowmo- bile owners to carry a minimum level ofliability insurance coverage and mandate thatriders under 18 wear a protective helmet. And nighttime speeds would be curtailed. Current law has a maximum speed limit of50 miles per hour on public lands or waters.HF406 would lower that to 40 miles per hour between sunset and sunrise. The bill has thesupport of the Minnesota UnitedSnowmobilers Association. Most of the committee's discussion fo- cused on those who consume alcohol andride. About 50 percent of snowmobile acci-dents are alcohol-related, Rep. AliceHausman (DFL-St. Paul) said. The currentproposals would not change the state's DWIlaws. Under current law, first time DWI offend- ers face up to 90 days in jail and a $700 fine.Repeat offenders face up to a year in jail anda $3,000 fine. Both penalties are the same asthose for driving under the influence onMinnesota roads. The penalties accumulatewith the offenses regardless of whether theyare committed on a snowmobile or in a car.Drunk drivers in cars face tougher penaltiesif they have a previous conviction for DWIon a snowmobile, and the reverse is true aswell. \"The fact that the state does not require licensing, training[for adults], or insurance is just incredible. . . . I'm nottrying to say 'let's ban snowmobiles.' are a fewsnowmobilers who must be stopped.\" \u2014Jan SchlosserThe rising number of deaths in Minnesota from snowmobile accidents has prompted lawmakers tointroduce a bill that would require snowmobilers to take a state-approved safety course and carry liabilityinsurance. Snowmobilers under 18 would be required to wear a helmet. The House Environment andNatural Resources Committee approved the bill Feb. 12.4 SESSION WEEKLY / February 14, 1997 Aside from criminal penalties, snowmobilers convicted of riding drunk willhave their operating privileges revoked for ayear. Those convicted of a DWI while driv-ing a car, however, do not have their snow-mobile privileges suspended. Snowmobilers Michael and Eugene Krueger urged lawmakers not to blame allsnowmobilers for the problems created by afew. \"I've been a snowmobiler all my life andI don't drink and ride and I never will,\" saidMichael Krueger. His father, Eugene, told the panel the law needs to come down harder on those whoride while intoxicated. \"The problem has tobe stopped at the bars.\" The elder Krueger said he opposed raising operator fees. \"I'm all for training and insur-ance,\" he said. \"But if you are going to re-quire it you need to regulate the insurancecompanies so they don't take advantage ofus.\" HF406 also calls for doubling the current snowmobile registration fee \u2014 to $60 from$30 every three years \u2014 for machines withengine displacements over 335 cubic centi-meters. Those fees go into a state account tomaintain state snowmobile trails. Many lookto an overburdened, underfunded, and out-of-date trail system as part of the problem aswell. \"Snowmobiling is a sport that took off in the 1970s and has continued to grow,\"Peterson said. \"Now we have a $1 billion-a-year sport operating on 1970s trails, 1970slaws, and 1970s enforcement. We need tocatch up to the 1990s.\" Peterson's bill also calls for the Depart- ment of Natural Resources (DNR) to adoptrules for safety standards on state-supportedtrails. The committee also passed a bill ( HF410 ) to increase the penalty for operators of snow-mobiles and other off-the-road vehicles whoflee from law enforcement officers. Sponsored by Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL- Mpls), the bill would make it a gross misde-meanor, punishable by up to a year in jailand a $3,000 fine. Causing the death of some-one while fleeing could result in 10 yearsimprisonment and a $20,000 fine. Undercurrent law, fleeing an officer is a misde-meanor, carrying a penalty of up to 90 daysin jail and a $700 fine. Some snowmobilers would rather flee and face a misdemeanor charge later when theyhave sobered up than stop for a law enforce-ment officer and get the stiffer drunken driv-ing penalty, Skoglund told the panel. Theproblem is exacerbated by the fact that DNRconservation officers are riding older andslower snowmobiles and many riders know they can get away, he added. HF406 now moves to the House Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee.HF410 was sent to the House Judiciary Com- mittee. \u2014Steve ComptonJan Schlosser of Wyoming, Minn., stopped her testimony to recompose herself before continuingto tell the Environment and Natural ResourcesCommittee Feb. 12 of how her daughter, Stacy,was killed by a snowmobiler. CHILDREN Special-needs adoptions A bill to better reimburse licensed private adoption agencies who help place children,often from abusive homes, with new adop-tive families is on its way to the House floor. Currently, the Minnesota Department of Human Services reimburses licensed privateadoption agencies a maximum of $4,000 percase and the cap hasn't increased since 1986.Today, it costs agencies from $8,000 to$13,000 to place a single child with specialneeds, said Bob DeNardo, a supervisor in thedepartment's family and children servicesdivision. Under the bill ( HF374 ), sponsored by Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud), there would beno cap on the reimbursement as long as the adoption services for the child were deemedto be \"reasonable and appropriate.\" TheDepartment of Human Services wouldreview each reimbursement request. The bill won approval from the House Health and Human Services CommitteeFeb. 11. The adoption reimbursement helps com- pensate the private agency for recruitingfamilies, matching them with the right spe-cial needs child, and preparing the family forthe child through education, counseling, andhome visits. Special-needs children are part of the Adoption Assistance Program and in manycases, have been severely neglected or abusedand their parents have relinquished theirparental rights to the state. The child maynot only suffer from physical problems butfrom behavioral, mental, and emotional onesas well. Children who do not come fromabusive homes, but who are severely dis-abled or have chronic health problems, canalso be considered special-needs children iftheir parents have relinquished their paren-tal rights. These children often wait in foster care until someone wants them, DeNardo said. Currently, there are 813 children in Min- nesota who are considered wards of the state.Each year, about 275 to 330 are placed inpermanent adoptive homes, DeNardo said. Last year, more money was set aside for reimbursement for private adoption agen-cies, but steps to remove the cap have beentied up by a departmental rulemaking pro-cedure. The longer state officials wait tomake the change, the greater the risk thatfewer children with special needs will beplaced. The current $4,000 cap discourages pri- vate agencies, especially the small ones, fromactively seeking families for special-needskids, DeNardo said, because they cannotrecoup their costs. The bill is designed to speed things up. It now moves to the House floor where it couldbe placed on the Consent Calendar, whichlists non-controversial bills.

It's called \"slamming\" and the methods employed include a check, a sweepstakesform, or a survey. But what the unknowingindividual or business doesn't realize is thatby participating or signing, they've autho-rized a switch in their long-distance com-pany. Members of the House Regulated Indus- tries and Energy Committee discussed theproblem Feb. 11. The 1996 Legislature passed a law to deal with slamming. It states that a customer canhave his or her original service reinstated atno charge and be re-billed if the originalcharges would have been lower. Further, along-distance company may be liable forcivil penalties if it fails to take appropriateactions, according to Eric Swanson of theOffice of the Attorney General. Because most of the provisions took effect on Jan. 1, 1997, it's too soon to assess thelaw's impact. Swanson said the best defense is still to be careful. Also, local companies will \"freeze\" acustomer's long-distance service upon re-quest, making it immune to slamming. That,however, prevents customers from takingadvantage of offers for lower rates, he said. Law or no law on the books, \"the problem is likely to become even bigger as competi-tion increases,\" Swanson added.

Statewide development Rural Minnesotans might get a boost in their business community, and homeownerscould get state-backed loans to fix any dam-age done by winter storms under legislationapproved by the House Economic Develop-ment and International Trade CommitteeFeb. 12.

The trade officials will most likelywork in outstate tourism offices with localgovernments to increase economicdevelopment.\"I think it would be really good for the department to have a presence in northernMinnesota, central Minnesota, and south-ern Minnesota,\" Jaros said, testifying . . . it mighteven save money.\" Economic development officers, he said, would be able to cut down on travel if theywere stationed closer to the communitieswith which they work. The committee also approved legislation sponsored by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls) that authorizes the MinnesotaHousing Finance Agency to make emergencyloans to homeowners. Under HF343 , loans of up to $10,000 would be made to low-income home ownersand could be used only for repairs that wouldprevent damage to the property from severeweather conditions, such as winter storms orspring floods. The legislation, which wouldbecome effective immediately after passageand expire July 1, 1997, would allow low-income homeowners to borrow at no inter-est and to defer repayment. Borrowers withslightly higher incomes would pay an inter-est rate of 3 percent. The loan would be forgiven if the bor- rower lives in the home for 10 years afterreceiving the money, and it comes due onlyif the building is sold during that 10-yearperiod. Both bills now head to the House floor. Solution on caps, testing A bill that would remove statutory caps on education spending and require uniformstatewide testing of public school students isheaded to Gov. Arne Carlson's desk. The bill ( HF1*/SF3 ) won final passage in the House Feb. 12 on a 129-2 vote. TheSenate passed the bill Feb. 13 on a 62-0 vote. Action on the bill came quickly on the heels of an agreement among legislative lead-ers to speed its passage. The bill would liftspending caps that, if left in place, wouldrequire school districts to absorb a $337million cut in funding for the next bien-nium. The bill also repeals a current law prohib- iting statewide testing, and includes a provi-sion to require statewide testing to beginduring the 1997-1998 school year, said Rep.Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park).Johnson and Sen. Keith Langseth (DFL-Glyndon) sponsored the bills. The specifics on how the statewide assess- ment system would work will be included inseparate legislation to be constructed duringthis session, Johnson said. Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer (R-Princeton) urged support of the bill during debate onthe House floor. \"If there are two things the public wants, they want us to fund education adequately,and they want education to have account-ability,\" Koppendrayer said. School district officials from around the6 SESSION WEEKLY / February 14, 1997state have urged lawmakers to move quickly this session to repeal the education spendingcaps. Many districts are already forming theirbudgets for the next school year, and withthe caps in place, must plan for programcutbacks and layoffs. The House passed a bill to repeal the caps Jan. 30 on a 133-0 vote. The Senate passedthe bill Feb. 3, but added an amendment thatwould require statewide standardized test-ing of Minnesota students. The move tem-porarily stalled further action on the bill. Statewide testing has been trumpeted by supporters as a way to increase accountabil-ity in public schools by providing a reliablemeasurement of student and school perfor-mance that can be compared to results fromother districts and states. House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL- Brooklyn Center) said at a Feb. 10 pressconference that he and other legislative lead-ers worked together to avoid a prolongeddebate on statewide testing, which wouldfurther delay the passage of HF1*/SF3 . The agreement, struck by majority and minority caucus leaders from both cham-bers, eventually led to the bill that won finalpassage in the House and Senate. The agreement also calls for the creation of a joint House-Senate committee to deviseseparate legislation prescribing exactly howstatewide testing would be implemented. \"It's a win-win situation,\" said House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon).\"It's certainly a win for the [school] systems,as they will get the funding that they need.And it's a win for students and parents, asthey will get the accountability that theydeserve.\" The special statewide testing committee will be chaired by Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee), who this year took over as chairof the K-12 Education Finance Division ofthe House Education Committee, and Sen.Larry Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls), who chairsthe Senate Education Committee. Carruthers said the committee will ensure \"an open process\" that allows for input fromthe public, local school officials, thegovernor's administration, and legislators. \"We've moved the debate off of whether or not we're going to have testing onto whatkind of testing we're going to have,\" saidSenate Majority Leader Roger Moe (DFL-Erskine). \"The process is under way now. It'snot going to stop.\"More education options Parents and students would have new edu- cational choices available to them under abill considered by the House Education Com-mittee during a Feb. 6 hearing. HF33 , sponsored by LeRoy Koppendrayer (R-Princeton), funding pro-posals for the next biennium. Chief among Carlson's proposals is his plan to provide tax relief to parents who sendtheir children to private schools. The proposal would increase the amount parents can claim as an income tax deduc-tion for education expenses from $650 to$1,950 for each dependent in grades K-6 andfrom $1,000 to $3,000 for each child in grades7-12. The bill also would give a separatecredit of $1,000 per child or a maximum$2,000 per family to taxpayers with an in-come of less than $39,000. Carlson's plan promises even more in the area of choice. The bill aims to increase the number of charter schools in the state and would elimi-nate provisions in current law that limit thetotal number of charter schools and the num-ber that can be sponsored by public collegesor universities. The bill also would providegrant funding for the so-called \"laboratoryschools\" at select public and private univer-sities in Minnesota and would bolster thestate's open enrollment system for publicschools. John Brandl, a University of Minnesota professor and former legislator, praised thegovernor's effort to give parents and stu-dents more financial capacity to choosethrough tax credits and expanded deduc-tions, and more choices, through more char-ter schools and college-sponsored labschools. \"We haven't done well enough. We need better education,\" Brandl said. \"Minneso-tans have put their money where their mouthsare, but we're still not doing well enough.\" Brandl was one of about two dozen people to testify on Koppendrayer's bill during thehearing. The Education Committee took no action on the bill. Decisions on the governor's pro-posals will come when the House compilesits omnibus K-12 funding bill later in thesession. HF33 drew support from Mark Myles, Duluth School District superintendent, whosaid the bill would bring forces of competi-tion to the \"protected monopoly\" of publiceducation. Specifically, Myles urged lawmakers tosupport provisions in the bill that would provide financial rewards to individualschools for meeting performance goals cre-ated on the local level. \"In education, there's too little reward for excellence and too few penalties for medioc-rity,\" Myles said. Some of the changes proposed in Koppendrayer's bill drew criticism fromTherese Van Blarcom, a member of the ElkRiver School Board. Van Blarcom called the tax credit and tax deduction proposals in the bill \"vouchers ofanother kind.\" And she was concerned thebill would drain much-needed resourcesfrom public schools. \"Choice has always been available and will always be available,\" Van Blarcom said. \"Forthose of us who choose public schools, pleasedo not tie the hands of our school boards.\" ENVIRONMENT Future of the white pine The oldest, tallest, and most majestic trees in Minnesota's forests are the white pine.But with only 2 percent of the state's originalwhite pine population still standing, conser-vationists, the timber industry, and stateofficials are all concerned about the tree'sfuture. A Department of Natural Resources (DNR) work group on regenerating the whitepine told the House Environment and Natu-ral Resources Committee Feb. 10 that thestate should set aside money to help regrowthe white pine in Minnesota. The group recommended that the state set a number of goals for its white pine popula-tion that include: doubling the number of white pines and the number of acres of young white pineswithin the next seven years and identifyingland suitable for white pine growth; adjusting the harvesting of white pines to help increase the trees' chances for a come-back; conducting research on genetic improve- ments to the white pine, not only to help itsregrowth, but to help the trees better with-stand their natural predators \u2014 white-tailed deer and blister rust disease; and distributing white pine management infor- mation. Rep. HF693 ) that would set aside $1.5 million over the next two years to helpregrow the white pine. By all measures, the white pine population in Minnesota has declined precipitously over7 February 14, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY HIGHER EDUCATION GOVERNMENT Minnesota Zoo volunteer Don Mereen showed Rep. Howard Swenson and the members ofthe House Environment and Natural ResourceFinance Committee a North Americanopossum during their hearing Feb. 10. Thezoo hopes for a budget increase this year.Ghosts in the machine The stroke of midnight on Jan. 1, 2000, could mark more than a new millennium \u2014it could signal the start of a massive failure inMinnesota's computer systems, a state offi-cial said Feb. 10. \"Some programs may not run at all, or some may sort records in the wrong order,\"said Bev Schuft, assistant commissioner ofthe Department of Administration's Infor-mation Policy Office. She presented a planfor addressing the problem to members ofthe Governmental Operations Committee'sState Government Finance Division. \"Secu-rity could be compromised,\" she warned. Schuft said that the information office needed $25 million in new appropriations toimplement the Year 2000 Project and headoff the disaster. She also said the total cost ofthe project can't be estimated because many state agencies have spent money on the prob-lem out of their regular operating funds andwill continue to do so. The $25 million, shesaid, represented the total amount requestedby state agencies to ensure that various \"mis-sion-critical applications\" would not fail. The problem, from which private sector businesses are not immune, began in the1970s when those designing computer sys-tems decided to store years as two digitsinstead of four. For example, the year 1997 isrepresented by the numbers nine and seven.As a result, Schuft explained, nearly everycomputer in the state will interpret the year2000, represented by a double zero, as theyear 1900, throwing whole systems \u2014 mostnotably payroll, pension, and tax collectionprograms \u2014 into disarray. Jim Close, the information office's Year 2000 Project director, said nearly 84 millionlines of computer code and more than 34billion database records need to be reviewedand corrected. At this point, Close said, theYear 2000 Project team has completed thefirst three phases of the endeavor \u2014 includ- College bonds A bill to help families save for their children's college education won approvalfrom a House panel Feb. 12. HF130 would allow the sale of state and federal bonds in increments as low as $500.Normally, the tax-exempt bonds are avail-able in denominations of $5,000 or more. \"We're essentially allowing middle-in- come families to participate in these pur-chases,\" said Rep. Lyndon Carlson(DFL-Crystal), the bill's sponsor. While the bonds will be available for pur- chase to anyone, the bill has several provi-sions designed to encourage their purchasefor college savings. The first $25,000 in pur-chased bonds will not be used in calculatinga student's state grant eligibility. And em-ployees will be allowed to pay for the bondsusing a payroll deduction plan, which lowersthe employee's taxable income. \"Not only will families get a tax break, they get a break in their needs assessment when astudent applies for aid,\" Carlson said. Similar programs operate in 24 other states, Carlson said. \"This is the first step in a largerfinancial aid package,\" he added. The Gopher State savings bonds program will apply to all higher education programs. A similar bill was passed unanimously by the full House in 1996, but the proposal didnot become law. HF130 , approved by the House Education Committee's Higher Education Finance Di-vision, now moves to the full EducationCommittee.the last 100 years due mostly to logging and land clearing for farming, according to theDNR work group. Information recorded during the Public Land Survey of Minnesota (1850-1905) in-dicated that white pines were then a com-mon occurrence on four million acres ofland, mostly in the central and northeasternpart of the state. A 1990 Minnesota forestinventory conducted by the U.S. Forest Ser-vice showed white pines occurring on onlyabout 63,700 acres. Another study, by theMinnesota Forest Resource Partnership in1996, put the white pine acreage at 82,000. The DNR's work group recommendations may not go far enough to satisfy some con-servationists. In testimony before the com-mittee, Lynn Rogers of the White Pine Societycriticized the group's decision-making pro-cess. \"The timber industry had toveto anything they didn't like,\" Rogers said. \"No one had veto power,\" said Bruce Zumbahlen, manager of the DNR's ForestResource Management Division. \"We used aconsensus-building approach. Recommen-dations were included in the report only if allmembers agreed.\" \"That boils down to a veto,\" Rogers said.Rogers' group offered its own recommen- dations including that the state stop sellingits white pines until a sustainable harvestplan is developed for each section of Minne-sota. Harvest plans should take into accountecological and aesthetic values and long-term values, he said. Rogers also said that allwhite pines older than 120 years should beexempt from harvesting.ing an impact analysis \u2014 and now needs to define the methods, develop a staffing plan,and do the work. \"Finding all the date occurrences is the hardest part,\" Close said. \"Fixing themshould be easy.\" The entire process should be completed by June 1999. HOUSING Helping the homeless A bill to provide up to $15 million in grants to aid the homeless won approvalfrom a House panel Feb. 13. As the Minnesota Legislature grapples with its response to federal welfare reform, hous-ing advocates are asking the state to provide8 SESSION WEEKLY / February 14, 1997 LABOR Sylvia Herndon, an assistant administrator for Catholic Charities in St. Paul, led members of the Housing and Housing Finance Division through Mary Hall, a transitional housing and emergencyshelter facility, Feb. 11. The room pictured is an emergency shelter area.Helping dislocated workers A plan by Gov. Arne Carlson to slash the budget of Minnesota's Dislocated WorkerProgram received no endorsement from theperson he appointed to oversee it. \"This is a very good program,\" said R. Jane Brown, commissioner of the Department ofEconomic Security. \"It is ranked near the topin the nation. Carlson's budget would cut the Dislo- cated Worker Program by $14.5 million peryear \u2014 nearly half its annual budget. The state program, (which also receives dollars from the federal government), wascreated in 1991 to help those who have losttheir jobs due to obsolete job skills, companydownsizing, or plant closings. In fiscal year 1995, the program helped 14,781 people return to the workforce at anaverage hourly wage of $12.15. Jim Korkki, director of the Dislocated Worker Program, told the House Labor-Management Relations Committee on Feb.10 that three types of people are helped bythe Dislocated Worker Program. \"Some just need assistance writing their resume and getting back in the job market,\"he said. \"Others have skills that need up-grading with a class or two. A third group hasnew funds to prepare for an anticipated in- crease in homelessness. At the Feb. 13 hear-ing before the House EconomicDevelopment and International TradeCommittee's Housing and Housing FinanceDivision, Sue Watlov-Phillips of the Minne-sota Coalition for the Homeless said that \"InWisconsin, when they instituted welfare re-form, they saw a 60 percent increase in emer-gency shelter use.\" HF99 , sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), would establish a $2 millionstate emergency services grant program tobe administered by the Department of Eco-nomic Security (DES). The bill also wouldadd $3 million to the state's existing $2.77million transitional housing program forthe biennium. Finally, the bill would create a$10 million backup fund to be used for eitheremergency services or transitional housingshould the need arise. Any increased need for current programs for the homeless would strain an alreadyoverburdened support system. The numberof people using emergency shelters and tran-sitional housing in the state has tripled overthe past 11 years, according to DES figures. Atotal of 4,981 Minnesotans needed servicesin 1996; 44 percent of those were children. The emergency services grants under HF99 could be used by local units of governmentand nonprofit organizations to provide emer-gency shelter or assist homeless persons inobtaining other services such as medical andpsychological help, employment counseling,substance abuse treatment, emergency childcare or transportation. The DES commissioner could require grant recipients to provide $1 in nonstatefunds for every $2 received in grant funds. The transitional housing program targets those in a temporary housing crisis in anattempt to stabilize their lives and preventthem from slipping into homelessness. \"Thetransitional housing program is a welfarereform program that we have pioneered inMinnesota,\" Watlov-Phillips said Jan. 30when the bill was first brought to the com-mittee. Use of the $10 million contingency fund would depend on the governor's determina-tion that homeless persons are being turnedaway from emergency shelters due to a lackof available space. Also testifying at the Jan. 30 meeting was Bonnie McCarty, who had her own crisiswhen, after 25 years of marriage, she experi-enced a contentious divorce followed by ahealth crisis. She lost her home and, aftergoing through back surgery, turned to theMankato Coalition for the Homeless for help. \"Now I have moved to St. Paul,\" she said.\"I have finished my degree and am now working full time and paying full rent.\" HF99 now goes to the House Economic Development and International TradeCommittee.obsolete skills that are no longer marketable. They need to be retrained for a new careerpath.\" The program is currently funded by a 0.1 percent payroll tax paid by all Minnesotaemployers. On average, the program costsabout $30 million per year, Brown said. Ofthe $14.5 million per year Carlson wants tocut from the existing program, about $6.5million would go to the state's general fund.The remaining $8 million would cover defi-cits at the Minnesota Comprehensive HealthAssociation (MCHA). MCHA is the state's high risk insurance pool for people who are uninsurable or withchronic health conditions. There are ap-proximately 32,000 enrollees in MCHA, ac-cording to Minnesota Commissioner ofCommerce David Gruenes. He explained tothe panel that Carlson believes the move is alegitimate use of dislocated worker funds,since the statutes that set up the fund includea provision for support services which mayinclude health care. Some dislocated work-ers are assisted by MCHA when they are laidoff and lose their health care benefits, Gruenessaid. Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville) asked if Carlson's recommendation might be basedon a declining need for the program. Brownanswered that even though unemploymentis low, many people are in job transition. The trend is for larger layoffs, Korkki told the committee. \"And that trend iscontinuing.\" \"There is a great deal of churning in both Minnesota and the country as a whole,\"Brown said. \"And people who are laid off areneeding greater skills to get reemployed.\"9 February 14, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYOUTSTATE TECHNOLOGYSnow cleanup costs A second House panel has approved a proposal to mark $20 million to help citiesand counties recoup some of their weather-related costs.

Most of theappropriations would be matched by federalemergency funds. How bad has this winter been? The aver- age December snowfall in Duluth, Minn., is16.1 inches. But this December, 41.7 inchesfell. Similar statistics can be reported for most of the towns and counties throughout Min-nesota during the winter of 1996-97. By justabout every measure, including low tem-peratures and wind, it has been the century'smost severe winter. Forty-nine counties inwestern Minnesota have been declared fed-eral disaster areas. The result? The majority of Minnesota counties are staring at empty emergency-management coffers. Funds for snow re-moval have long since dried up. Even with the infusion of $20 million, the shortfall in counties throughout the state isalmost $60 million, according to the Minne-sota Department of Public Safety (DPS). \"This money won't begin to cover actual costs,\" said James Franklin of the DPS. \"Itprovides a percentage of budget overruns.\" And the worst may not be over. The Na- tional Weather Service is preparing its firstforecast for spring flooding. Another big concern: \"What if this winter isn't an aberration?\" asked Rep. MichaelPaymar (DFL-St. Paul). \"What if, for thenext 20 years, we keep having 'historic' snow-falls?\" Franklin said the DPS has developed a plan to track problem areas throughout thestate and apply preventive measures. A ma-jor element will be to build \"living snowfences\" of trees that would block wind, andthus, prevent the huge drifts that haveplagued counties this year. \"We can't pre-vent snow, but we can prevent how it blows,\"Franklin said. The plan is currently in searchof funding. Franklin said counties that intend to seek funding should prepare by reviewing andupdating their emergency response plans,identifying problem areas, and exploringpartnerships and other innovative ways to deal with emergencies. HF100 , approved by the House Judiciary Committee's Judiciary Finance Division,now moves to the full Judiciary Committee. I want my HDTV Minnesota's largest public television sta- tion plans to construct a digital broadcastfacility in anticipation of shifting industrystandards, a public television executive toldmembers of the House Governmental Op-erations Committee's State Government Fi-nance Division Feb. 11. \"The Digital Age is upon us,\" said Jim Kutzner, vice president at Twin Cities PublicTelevision, which runs KTCA (Channel 2)and KTCI (Channel 17). \"This is not goingto be simply analog television stuffed into anew system.\" What it will be, Kutzner said, is the appli- cation of a technology that is fundamentallydifferent from anything that has come be-fore it. Digital television stations will be ableto provide a High-Definition TV signal com-parable in quality to a 35 mm Hollywoodfilm. In place of the HDTV signal, the stationcould choose to broadcast four signals oflesser quality through the same digital cable,allowing for a much broader range of pro-gramming. Twin Cities Public Television, Kutzner said, plans to build the digital station, at atotal cost of $2.25 million, and have it on lineby August 1998. It would be one of the firstsuch stations in the world. The station plansto provide $1.5 million of the total, andhopes the state will provide the other$750,000. (Gov. Arne Carlson has called forthe appropriation in his budget recommen-dations.) Public television's share of the funds, Kutzner said, will come, in part, frompartnering with the private sector, althoughthe details of that arrangement have yet to befinalized. \"We recognize that in order for us to survive in the new world,\" Kutzner said,\"there's going to have to be a healthy mar-riage of mission and revenue.\" Television and computer manufacturers have argued for years over the industry'sdigital broadcast specifications. In Decem-ber 1996, the Federal Communications Com-mission (FCC) finally adopted standards(defined by the Advanced Television Sys-tems Committee, a group formed specifi-cally to develop a solution to the problem).Those standards decreed that all broadcast- ers must phase in the new digital technologyimmediately. The FCC is expected to assigndigital TV frequencies to broadcasters in thenear future. \"When this occurs,\" Kutzner said, \"the gates will be thrown open\" to rapid productdevelopment, and Minnesota, with its newstation, could quickly become an industryleader. TRANSPORTATIONSAFETY Minors must buckle up Police would have the authority to stop cars if passengers under 18 years old are notusing seat belts, under a bill on the way to theHouse floor. HF221 , sponsored by Rep. Jim Rhodes (R-St. Louis Park), was approved Feb. 12 bythe House Transportation and Transit Com-mittee. \"We feel it's a safety issue, a children's issue, and a health issue,\" Rhodes said. \"Wethink this will save lives. It's that simple.\" Rhodes' bill would make two significant changes in state law regarding the use of seatbelts. First, it would extend existing law requir- ing all occupants between the ages of 3 andProtecting kids in carts Small children accompanying mom or dad to the grocery store would be less likely tobecome a casualty under legislation approvedby the House Commerce, Tourism and Con-sumer Affairs Committee Feb. 13 HF10 , sponsored by Rep. Mike Jaros (DFL-Duluth), would require retailers toequip their shopping carts with child-pro-tective devices. Children, Jaros said, have apropensity to fall out of shopping carts, of-ten sustaining potentially lethal head inju-ries as a result. \"There are kids dying out there,\" because of shopping cart accidents, Jaros said in sup-port of the bill. \"This is probably the bestpro-life legislation you'll see this session.\" Yet HF10 , which was approved by an 11- 9 vote, also drew some objections. Childrenriding in shopping carts often suffer facialinjuries, too, noted Rep. Ron Erhardt (R-Edina). \"Should we not mandate helmets ifchildren are going to ride in these kinds ofvehicles?\" he asked. The bill now goes to the House floor.10 SESSION WEEKLY / February 14, 1997 District 50A 1996 population: 37,063 Largest city: East northern metropolitan area Top concern: \"People in my district are concerned about a whole range of issues. I think they wantgovernment that is efficient and effective. For themost part, I think people in the district realize thatwe do have shared responsibilities and that gov-ernment is the way that we can get the thingsdone that are best done together, like educatingour children. \u2014Rep. Kathleen SekhonAfter two years of watching from the side- line, Rep. Kathleen Sekhon (DFL-BurnsTownship) has returned to the House withidealism tempered by realism. Sekhon, who served one term in the Housebefore a 1994 electiondefeat, still has many ofthe same concerns asduring her first term.However, she acknowl-edges that she has a dif-ferent outlook fromwhen she arrived at the Capitol to begin her first term. \"Certainly, I come with a more realistic picture of what can happen and what I canaccomplish,\" Sekhon said. \"You could easilywork around the clock for six months andstill not do everything worthwhile. My goalis to try to streamline the process, based onwhat I learned three and four years ago, sothat I can make the best use of my time.\" After losing her seat to Republican Tom Hackbarth, of Cedar, Minn., in 1994, Sekhonreturned to her career as a teacher, workingas a substitute mainly at the middle schoollevel, and remained involved in several com-munity groups. As the 1996 election approached, there was little doubt about Sekhon's intentions. \"The issues that were of top concern to me are continuing issues,\" she said. \"We need tohave committed people who are willing towork hard if we are going to accomplish thethings that we need to accomplish. It wasclear to me that I was going to run again.\" Sekhon regained her House seat in a closely fought rematch with Hackbarth. It was hersecond victory in four consecutive campaignsfor the House.New members . . . Sekhon focuses on education, environment issues The oldest of seven children, Sekhon grew up in Pipestone, Minn., and received abachelor's degree in elementary educationfrom the University of Minnesota-Duluth.She is married and has three children, all incollege. Sekhon's political life began in 1980, when she attended her first precinct caucus. Shewound up being a delegate to the state DFLconvention that year, which led her to fur-ther involvement in the party and in otherpolitical organizations. She served as co-chair of the DFL Platform and Issues Com-mission from 1984 to 1990, when shelaunched her first campaign for office. Issues such as education funding, envi- ronmental protection, and workplace safetymake up the core of Sekhon's legislativeagenda. This year, she has been named vice chair of the Environment and Natural Resources Fi-nance Committee, and she also is a memberof a separate environment policy committee. From those positions, Sekhon plans to be a voice for groundwater protection, wastereduction, and improved waste management.Her take on environmental issues focuses onthe long-term implications of current poli-cies and practices. \"We need to consider the future costs of what we are doing today,\" she said. \"I wantto look to the future when we're making ourpolicy decisions.\" Education funding and property tax reform are two issues that go hand-in-hand, accordingto Sekhon. She would like to see significantchanges to address both problem areas. \"We need to change the way we fund our schools,\" she said. \"I'd love to see 100 per-cent state funding and no dependence onresidential property taxes.Rep. Kathleen Sekhon\"I don't know that we're going to be able to get to that point, but I think more andmore legislators are realizing that the prop-erty tax is not the best way for us to befunding schools.\" The forecast $1.4 billion surplus in state coffers provides a rare chance to make sig-nificant changes, Sekhon said, and that pro-vides her additional reason for optimism asreturns to the House. \"When I was here last time, it was during the shortfall period,\" she said. \"It's going tobe very exciting working at a time when wedo have a good economic forecast, when itlooks like we have some money we can usefor critical investments like education.\" Sekhon heads into her second term with a clear message from her constituents, a groupshe believes to include an unusually largenumber of independent voters with littleinterest in partisan politics. \"They want work done. They don't want bickering and partisan attacks,\" Sekhon said.\"That's very counterproductive, and I don'tthink it will be tolerated by the people in mydistrict.\" \u2014Nick Healy11, regardless of where they are seated in thevehicle, to wear seat belts to include anyonebetween the ages of 3 and 18. (Current law requires passengers aged 3 and under to be secured in child car seats.Passengers aged 11 and up currently arerequired to wear seat belts only when ridingin the front seat. Under the bill, passengersaged 18 and up still would be required towear a seat belt only when in the front seat.) Second, the bill would make it a primary offense not to have all occupants between 3and 18-years-old buckled up. Currently, violation of seat belt require-ments for occupants older than 3 is a second- ary offense. That means police can issue acitation only after a vehicle is stopped for amoving violation or another violation in-volving vehicle equipment. The bill would allow police to stop any vehicle in which any passenger between 3and 18 years old, whether in the front seat orback, is not using a seat belt. Rhodes supported his bill with a Depart- ment of Health report showing the majorityof minors who suffered serious neurologicalinjuries in motor vehicle crashes were notwearing seat belts.According to the report, crashes in the years 1993-1996 caused brain and spinalcord injuries to 407 children under 18 whowere not wearing seat belts. Only 198 chil-dren in that age group suffered similar inju-ries despite wearing seat belts. The report also showed that a dispropor- tionate number of neurological injuries weresuffered by children 15 to 17 years old. Theinjury totals for that age group include 265people not wearing seat belts and 87 wearingseat belts. Rhodes' bill passed on a voice vote.11 February 14, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYForty years ago, an en- tire generation thrilled tothe adventures of the LoneRanger and his faithfulcompanion, Tonto. To-day, kids like to pretendthey're MightyMorphin' Power their parents won-der whatever happened to\"Hiyo, Silver \u2014 away!\" And that, said cultural anthropologist and author Jennifer James, is precisely the prob-lem. James has authored the book, Thinking in the Future Tense, which explores the skills Americans will need to survive in our rapidlychanging culture. She spoke to a group oflegislators Feb. 11 at the Minnesota HistoryCenter's 3M Auditorium as the second offive speakers in the Capitol Forum Series,sponsored by Minnesota Technology Inc.and the McKnight Foundation. \"Look at them,\" James said of the ani- mated characters who combat intergalacticevil. \"Half of the time they're dinosaurs andhalf the time they use technology . . . and theytransform back and forth. When they can'tdeal with a problem, they pull everybodytogether \u2014 all genders, all races \u2014 andmorph into a new entity.\" The power rangers, James said, have be- come one of the new American myths, deftlyillustrating all of the qualities employers seekin workers today: flexibility, an appreciationfor diversity and teamwork, and a willing-ness to embrace new technologies. And mostof us just don't get it. Our culture, James said, has experienced profound change during the last two de-cades. Moreover, the pace of that change willnot slow anytime soon. Indeed, it will accel-erate. As it does, the weaknesses inherent inmany of our institutions, which James re-ferred to as \"lodges,\" will become even morepronounced than they are now. For example, she said, a degree from the Citadel, that Southern bastion of male mili-tary tradition, once guaranteed a commis-sion in the army or a position on the fasttrack in a Southern corporation. Today, thetimes have changed and the military haschanged with them. Women and minoritieshave positions of power in the armed ser-vices and the Army is often held up as amodel of affirmative action that has worked.Capital Forum Series . . . Mighty morphin' lawmakers must respond to change And the Citadel? James asked. They're too busy hazing each other to notice, she said. \"Now those companies,\" that used to hire Citadel grads, James said, \"are working on adiverse, team concept and they don't want abully.\" But the cracks in the \"lodge\" walls extend far beyond the Citadel, she said. Pick aninstitution \u2014 the legal or medical profes-sions, academia, politics, even that corner-stone of American values, the nuclear family.All of these \"lodges,\" she said, have becomeinadequate, at best \u2014 perhaps even destruc-tive \u2014 as people evolve out of the hunter-gatherer mentality and into the future. James framed this evolution in a structure of four interlocking areas: technology, eco-nomics, culture, and demography. Each, shesaid, provides a bit of context that, whentaken as a whole, will define the new mindset. Technology, she said, will also dramati- cally change the way we work, much morethan it has already, as greater numbers ofpeople work out of \"technology cottages\" in their homes. Correspondingly, she said,workers can enjoy more family time andcloser relationships because they choosewhen they want to work, rather than havingit defined by the company. \"Everything the Industrial Revolution took away,\" James said, \"we can get back . . . [but]when technology shifts, so do the means ofproduction. We're developing a new charac-ter and a new worker.\" And as corporations have begun to seek out workers who can thrive in the new high-tech environment, she said, the old classstructure is falling away. A new one, basedon different definitions of mental health andintelligence, has begun to develop. For ex-ample, technology has brought about some-thing that has never existed before; today, afive-year-old can routinely beat an adult at avideo game and that kid is potentially a morevaluable worker than the adult. Corollary of the new worker, she said, is a new demography. Of course, if you changethe demography, you change the culture,which is where the power rangers come in. The kids watching the power rangers will create our new lodges, our new institutions,for the good of the community, James said,and legislators need to let that happen. \"You need . . . to set the model,\" James said to legislators. \"This is an extraordinary timein history. You are the examples.\" Many of the legislators who heard James said they came away with a remarkablychanged view of their role as policymakers\u2014 particularly with regard to the legacy oftheir decisions. \"Some of the things she said ruffled my edges a bit, but they made me think I've gotto change,\" said Rep. Bruce Anderson (R-Buffalo Township), adding that Jamesseemed to raise hackles in both the DFLersand Republicans. \"For my kids . . . we've gotto change.\" Other lawmakers said James provided some valuable insight and allowed them tothink outside of the box traditionally thedomain of the representative. \"It's important for us to hear,\" said Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park), theday after the lecture, adding that she thoughtof James' remarks in a committee hearing.\"It's forced me to think 10 years down theroad instead of one.\" \u2014 F.J. GallagherJennifer James, a cultural anthropologist and author of the book, Thinking in the Future Tense, lectured lawmakers on the dynamics of change,Feb. 11, at the Minnesota History Center. Thelecture was part of the Capitol Forum Series '97.12 SESSION WEEKLY / February 14, 1997Committee Scopes & Agendas 1997- 98 Minnesota House of Representatives The Minnesota Legislature \u2014 the House of Representatives and the Senate \u2014 is dividedinto many committees, divisions, and sub-committees. Since thousands of bills are intro-duced during each two-year legislative session,it is impossible for any one legislator to becomean expert in all areas. Therefore, each legisla-tor serves on three to five committees anddivisions, which allows him/her to focus onjust a few areas of policy or finance. In a sense, the committee structure forms the heart of the Legislature. Although many peoplebelieve that most of the legislative process oc-curs on the House and Senate floors, it's incommittee where most substantive action oc-curs. It is there where each bill is pored overand dissected, where key amendments areadded and sections are deleted, and whererecommendations for approval are given orwithheld. In an effort to provide people with a general outline of House activities this session, as wellas an indication of where to go with variousissues of concern, the Session Weekly asked House committee administrators and chairsfor brief, general descriptions of the functionsof their committees and divisions. More spe-cifically, they were asked what topics werelikely to be considered this session. Here are the results of the survey \u2014 a list of all committees and divisions, the boundariesof their concerns, and in most cases, somespecific areas they expect to address during the1997 session.

A quest for information has been influenced by the need to have more detailed knowledgeabout the important issues introduced in the form of bills and discussed in committeehearings. Walk into a committee meeting, and likely, you will think you are in a college classroom. Depending on the committee, you may find yourself listening to anacademic discussion or a question and answer discourse on the state of prisons, welfare,highways, school recidivism, or why frogs with abnormal bodies are being found insouth central Minnesota. For members and staff, a recent increase in what is being learned about the many aspects affecting our lives, is for the most part, a direct influence on an increase in theamount of information offered throughout the complex. As reported in the Jan. 31, 1997, Session Weekly, page 15, a new source for learning is a five-part Capitol Forum series, \"Discussing Minnesota's Future,\" sponsored by Minnesota Technology Inc. and the McKnight Foundation. Topics already explored bylawmakers are \"Transforming the Face of Minnesota's Workforce\" and \"Thinking inthe Future Tense.\" Other experts have assisted with extending the knowledge of individuals in the Capitol complex through seminars, lectures, hearings, and fact-finding tours. Thoseparticipating have been informed and advised on a variety of issues yet to come beforethe Legislature. In the last three weeks, continuing education around the complex embodied reshap- ing Minnesota's welfare program; how a shift in the use of public tax dollars can changeeconomic development for the state; and the implications of universal access in the1996 U.S. Telecommunications Act. Other lectures, reported in this issue of the Session Weekly , involved a four-hour crime prevention issues forum, and a joint gathering of the House and Senate on closingthe learning gap among rich and poor youth throughout the state. Legislators are showing much seriousness as they scurry from a seminar to a committee hearing and then to session. A dedication to an increase in knowledge bylawmakers and some staff is obvious. For most, the end result will be personaldevelopment. The lawmaking process will benefit. According to the educator, John Dewey, \"Development emphasizes the need of . . . . . . with a view to mastering the way of dealing with theproblems of experience, not [just] the piling up of information.\" \u2014LeClair Lambert Blueprint images courtesy Minnesota Historical Society3 February 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Week in Review . . . Feb. 13 - 20, 1997 Highlights The House Judiciary Committee approved a bill Feb. 17 that would transform thedesign of the prison scheduled for con- struction in Rush City, Minn., this spring.The new plan calls for double-bunking inthe majority of the prison cells. Originally,most cells would have held a single prisoner. HF268 would repeal a statute that re- quires inmates to be placed in separate cellswhenever space allows in prisons at a secu-rity level of the planned Rush City prison.Higher security prisons, such as Oak ParkHeights, would not be affected by the pro-posal. The bill also reverses an earlier re-quirement specific to the Rush City prisonthat it be designed with mostly single occu-pancy units. The bill now requires the oppo-site \u2014 the new facility must provide multipleoccupancy cells \"to the greatest extent pos-sible.\" The result is that only one-seventh ofthe cells at Rush City will house a singleprisoner. \"The main difference between this and the 1996 bill [authorizing the prison to be built]is that it allows the facility to be double-celled,\" said Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown), the bill's sponsor. The corrections department had asked for $100 million for the prison; the Legislatureapproved $89 million in its bonding bill lastsession. The department's new plan calls for three 'pods,' or living sections, with 136 double- occupancy cells in each, and one pod with136 single-occupancy units. The double-oc-cupancy cells will measure 84.2 square feet.The new design increases the facility's capac-ity to 952 inmates, up from 800. The earlier plan had called for six single- occupancy pods. The two pods not requestedin the new proposal could be added later ifneeded.Rush City prison . . . Revised plan uses double-bunking to meet budget Minnesota's only maximum security prison, Oak Park Heights, shown above , will not be affected by legislation that would allow the new prison in Rush City to be built with double occupancy cells. According to projections compiled by Minnesota Planning Criminal Justice Cen-ter, Minnesota youths age 15 to 19 had thehighest arrest rates for violent and nonvio-lent crimes in 1995, the year of the study.Minnesota's population in the 10- to 24-year age group is expected to climb in theseven-county metro area from 470,760 in1995 to 552,210 in 2005, when it reaches itspeak. In Minnesota's remaining 80 counties, that population will peak in the year 2000 at 489,040, according to the study. Crime sta-tistics reveal those populations to be over-represented in the state's prison population.Further, the overall adult male prison popu-lation in Minnesota is expected to increasefrom 5,043 in 1997 to 6,282 in 2005. Anadditional 346 adult females are also ex-pected to be behind bars. Both populationsare expected to exceed prison capacity. While double-bunking enables the prison to be built within budget and adds to itscapacity, it raises other concerns. Much de-bate has centered around safety issues forboth inmates and personnel. The solution,according to prison officials who testifiedbefore the committee Feb. 17, is to providethe necessary staffing and activities for stateinmates. The intention is for prisoners to bein their cells only at night. \"The bottom line is that there's an inter- connection between staff, programming,double-bunking, inmate security, and guardsecurity. If that isn't addressed by the legisla-tion, we'll have problems,\" said John Beer ofAFSCME, which represents the union towhich many prison personnel belong. \"Withadequate staffing, remarkable things can bedone to manage institutions.\" Beer said thereis a correlation between assaults and inad-equate staffing, but the role of double-bunk-ing in the equation was not known. He saidthat AFSCME has \"not taken a hard and fastposition\" on double-bunking. Still, his points raised the question from Rep. Sherry Broecker (R-Vadnais Heights)as to how much money double-bunking saves \"We're doing this for money and only money. \u2014Rep. Michael Paymar4 SESSION WEEKLY / February 21, 1997if it increases staff and program require- ments. \"We're not prepared to say how much money the new plan will save, but we think itwill create some efficiencies,\" Benson said.\"We'll have to add some staff,\" but not somuch it will drive up costs, he added. And Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) questioned the wisdom of any policy thatforces prisoners into close quarters. \"I'm speaking against this policy in the strongest terms,\" he said. \"I think we'll seean increase in assaults and lawsuits. Theissues of the safety of the staff and inmateshave not been adequately addressed by this for money andonly money. While we have a fiduciary re-sponsibility, this is shortsighted.\" Paymar also expressed doubt at Deputy Commissioner Dennis Benson's assertionthat only one confirmed rape has occurredin more than 10 years within the prisonpopulation. The prison environment pre-cludes the reporting of such crimes, Paymarsuggested. No study has been conducted on the poli- cies other states follow on prison double-bunking. Minnesota is thought to be amonga minority with laws on the books in thisregard. On the federal level, only one prison\u2014 a \"super-maximum\" security facility inColorado \u2014 has exclusively single-occu-pancy units throughout the facility. The department also outlined for law- makers a new classification system in whichall prisons will be assigned a number be-tween one and six, with six referring to thehighest security facilities, and one, the low-est. Rush City's prison will be classified as alevel four, which is the highest number inwhich double-bunking will be allowed. Theprison at Oak Park Heights is a maximumsecurity, or level six; Stillwater and St. Cloudcorrectional facilities are level three; Brainerd's fa-cility and Willow River, Red Wing,MSU/Stillwater, and Shakopee correctionalfacilities are level one. HF268 now moves to the House Capital Investment Committee. \u2014 Celeste RileyAGRICULTURE The price of ethanol Minnesota's burgeoning ethanol industry was the subject of criticism and praise dur-ing a Feb. 14 House Agriculture Committeehearing focused on a recent legislativeauditor's report on state ethanol programs. The report, released in early February, questions the benefits of Minnesota's pro-motion of ethanol in gasoline, but somecommittee members and other officials wereunbending in their support for the ethanolindustry. \"Ethanol production is one of those things that is a bright star out there,\" said Rep.Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison). According to the report, the ethanol in- dustry has helped small, rural communitiesby providing high-wage jobs and a marketfor corn growers. However, the report also notes that the state has paid a high price to support etha-nol, and the product has driven up gasolineprices and reduced gas mileage. The report estimates that Minnesota con- sumers pay an extra 2-to 3-cents-per-gallonfor ethanol-blended fuel, creating a totalstatewide cost of about $42 million annually. However, a Department of Agriculture official argued that ethanol is not respon-sible for higher prices at the pump. \"We dispute that,\" said Jerry Heil, direc- tor of agriculture marketing and develop-ment for the department. \"We disagree withthe methodology used to draw that conclu-sion.\" The state requires the use of ethanol or similar products to reduce harmful automo-bile emissions, but the report states there isno clear link between the use of ethanol-blended fuel and reduced carbon monoxidein the atmosphere. \"As far as the environmental issues are concerned, it's a question mark,\" LegislativeAuditor James Nobles said. \"It's not so mucha negative statement as it is a question mark.\" Not so, according to Heil, who said there is \"no doubt\" ethanol has had an effect onreducing pollution. State law requires that gasoline sold year- round in the Twin Cities area contain acertain amount of oxygen. Beginning in Oc-tober 1997, the oxygen requirement will beextended statewide. (Use of ethanol is notmandated, but the product, which is derivedfrom corn and other agricultural products,is the oxygenation agent regularly used inMinnesota.) There are now eight ethanol plants oper-ating in the state, and three more are under construction. All but one of the plants arefarmer-owned cooperatives, and most ofthem were constructed after the state initi-ated the producer payment in 1987. The producer payment provides a 20-cent- per-gallon subsidy for ethanol. The federalgovernment contributes an additional 54-cent-per-gallon subsidy. The report estimates the industry's total economic impact statewide to be $211 mil-lion to $327 million annually. But, the reportsays, the industry costs Minnesotans a sig-nificant sum in state subsidies, higher gasprices, and reduced fuel efficiency. Gov. Arne Carlson is advocating increased state support for ethanol. The governor'sbudget proposal calls for the state to spend$49 million on ethanol subsidies during the1998-1999 biennium, double the amountspent during the current two-year spendingperiod. Tax-free farm equipment Minnesota farmers would not be required to pay state sales tax on the agriculturalmachinery necessary to their industry, un-der a bill approved Feb. 17 by the HouseAgriculture Committee. HF118 , sponsored by Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar), would permanently lift thestate sales tax on both new and used farmmachinery. \"There's no tax along the rest of the food chain right now,\" Juhnke said. \"Why shouldwe tax it in the beginning?\" Current state law includes a temporary sales tax exemption for used farm machin-ery, but it is set to expire June 30, 1997.Without the exemption, farmers buying usedmachinery would be required to pay 2.5percent sales tax, the same rate currentlyapplied to new farm machinery purchases. The exemption for used farm machinery has been in place since 1994, when a law waspassed allowing the exemption for a periodof one year. Subsequently, lawmakers havetwice voted to extend the sunset date of thatlaw. \"I don't see any reason why we should be back here every year doing this,\" Juhnkesaid. \"It ought to be permanent.\" The bill originally affected only the sales of used farm machinery, but the committeeapproved an amendment to exempt newmachinery as well. It is estimated that the tax exemption for used machinery would cost the state about$3.4 million in lost revenue during the 1998-5 February 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY99 biennium. Adding new machinery to the equation would push the total to $26.2 mil-lion in lost tax revenue during the two-yearperiod. The exemption would apply to machinery used directly and principally for productionof crops, livestock, and other agriculturalgoods. That includes anything from milkingmachines to tractors. Farmers would continue to pay full sales tax on related equipment, such as pickuptrucks and snow blowers. HF118 now moves to the House Taxes Committee. Adoption reimbursement caps A bill to allow the state to reimburse adop- tion agencies up to $16,000 when placingcertain children with adoptive families wonapproval from the House GovernmentalOperations Committee Feb. 20. The bill ( HF374 ) will affect special needs children who are eligible for the state's adop-tion assistance program. Most of the chil-dren are in the foster care system and havesuffered from neglect or abuse. (See Feb. 14,1997, Session Weekly , page. 4.) Reimbursement for agency costs is cur- rently capped at $4,000 per child, a figurethat hasn't changed since 1980. Costs for theplacements now average between $8,000 and$13,000. One reason for the increased cost isthe need for extensive follow-up services forspecial-needs placements. Bill sponsor Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud) said there are 813 children currentlyin foster care whom the new law will effect.Their average age is eight, he said. An un-known number of other children are cur-rently in various stages of adoption. Knoblach's original proposal left the re- imbursement figure open-ended, limitedonly to \"reasonable and appropriate costs.\"But several committee members expressedconcern that a cap is needed to prevent costsfrom rising dramatically. \"We need a cap or costs will rise to the maximum people think they can get,\" saidRep. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids). HF 374 now moves to the House floor.Alcohol-free drivers School bus drivers would be disqualified from their job if caught with even a trace ofalcohol in their system, under a bill ap-proved Feb. 19 by the House Transportationand Transit Committee. HF506 , sponsored by Rep. Doug Swenson (R-Forest Lake), would make it illegal for aschool bus driver to be on the job \"whenthere is physical evidence present in theperson's body of the consumption of anyalcohol.\" Current state law makes it a crime for a school bus driver to operate a bus with ablood-alcohol concentration of .04 percentor more. The .04 percent limit applies to allcommercial drivers. The legal limit for otherdrivers is .10 percent . Under Swenson's bill, school bus drivers or Head Start bus drivers would face a mis-demeanor charge if caught with alcohol intheir system. And violators would lose theircommercial license for one year on the firstoffense. The alcohol-related provision is part of a larger school bus safety bill that would makenumerous technical changes in the law inorder to update state standards for schoolbus equipment. Swenson's bill is based on recommenda- tions from the School Bus Safety AdvisoryCommittee, a 17-member panel includingCarol Holmes of Plymouth holds her daughter, Laura, while listening to U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstoneand others speak at a PTA rally in honor of the organization's 100-year anniversary.The event tookplace in the Capitol rotunda Feb. 17.

The provision tightening the alcohol limit for school bus drivers was included in the billto \"create a not-a-drop environment,\" saidDennis Lazenberry, pupil transportationsafety director for the state patrol and amember of the advisory committee. The bill also would make some minor changes to existing state law regarding bussafety education for students. A 1994 law requires school districts to designate the first week of each school year asschool bus safety week. During that week,each district is required to provide K-12students with bus safety training. Swenson's bill would move school bus safety week to the third week of the schoolyear and would lift the requirement thatstudents be trained in bus safety during thatweek. Lazenberry said the proposed changes aim to give school districts more flexibility dur-ing the busy days at the beginning of theschool year. Members of the committee deleted a sepa- rate, potentially controversial provision fromthe bill. The provision would have mandated that school bus drivers walk the aisle after eachroute to check for sleeping children or otherstragglers, and it would have made failure todo so a misdemeanor. Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls) said such checks are \"a good practice,\" but that it is notEDUCATIONSCHOOL6 SESSION WEEKLY / February 21, 1997ENVIRONMENTELECTIONS Keeping track of voters Under a bill approved Feb. 17 by the Gen- eral Legislation, Veterans Affairs and Elec-tions Committee, the Office of the Secretary of State will acquire change-of-address listsfrom the U.S. Postal Service. The lists willhelp the Secretary's office maintain accurateand updated records of registered voters. About 25,000 Minnesotans change resi- dences each year, but the Secretary of State'soffice has no way of tracking them. \"Wedon't even know they've moved until a voterattempts to register or vote again,\" said JoeMansky, director of the Secretary of State'sElections Division. \"Our records can be in-accurate for up to two years.\" The Secretary of State's office will collect the lists about once a month. It has the fullcooperation of the postal service, Manskysaid. \"Now we can update our database onan ongoing basis so it's always correct.\" The office will send a postcard to each resident who moves within Minnesota, in-forming them of the location of their newpolling place. HF294 , sponsored by Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins), now moves to the Housefloor. Snowmobile funding As Minnesota's 1997 snowmobile-related death toll rose to a record of 28, legislatorsintroduced yet more proposals addressingsnowmobile safety, trail maintenance, andfunding issues. Rep. Tom Bakk (DFL-Cook) brought a bill ( HF407 ) to the House Environment and Natural Resources Committee Feb. 19 thatseeks additional revenue to help pay for thesnowmobile initiatives that other bills areproposing. \"We need an influx of money into the system,\" Bakk told the panel. \"I supportmany of the policy issues that are beingbrought forward. But without funding, wewon't be able to enact these new policies.\" Bakk's bill would increase the snow- mobile registration fee from the current $30every three years to $45. The measure wouldraise an additional $1.25 million annually, Bakk said. Other bills under considerationby the Legislature, including one the com-mittee approved last week, would double thefee to $60. Bakk also proposed that snowmobilers be required to purchase $10 permit stickers inorder to use state-owned trails. The 2,000miles the backboneof Minnesota's 18,000-mile snowmobile trailsystem, Bakk said. The other 16,000 miles oftrails are locally owned and maintained,often with state grants. The sticker fee wouldgenerate another $3 million annually,according to Bakk, without penalizing thosewho don't use the system, such as farmerswho just use snowmobiles to do chores ontheir own property. Sticker fees would alsoallow the state to collect from out-of-stateriders who use Minnesota's trail system, Bakksaid. In addition, the bill provides that 1 per- cent of the state's gasoline tax revenues bedesignated for snowmobile-related purposes.About 1 percent of gasoline sold in the stategoes into snowmobiles. The bill also would appropriate $1 million annually from the state general fund in 1997and 1998 for local trail maintenance. For the Linda Wolford, Minneapolis, and other Metro Mobility riders attended a rally in the Capitolrotunda Feb. 19 to support full funding for the system and to talk about issues such as the increasein trip denials.past few years, snowmobile clubs, whichmaintain local trails with state grant-in-aidfunds, have run out of money before the endof the season and had to ask the Legislaturefor emergency appropriations. Most clubshave already exhausted this year's trail main-tenance funds. HF407 was approved and now moves to the Transporation and Transit Committee. HOUSING Accessibility loans Foster parents wanting to take in a dis- abled child will be eligible for the MinnesotaHousing Finance Agency's accessibility loanprogram, under a provision in a bill ( HF517 ) approved by the House Economic Develop-ment and International Trade Committee'sHousing and Housing Finance DivisionFeb. 18. Accessibility loans are typically used to pay for construction of wheelchair rampsand other special adaptations needed by dis-abled people. Under current law, only dis-abled individuals or their families are eligiblefor the loan program. HF517 would allow loans to households if someone residing innecessary to threaten bus drivers with a mis- demeanor penalty. HF506 now goes to the House Judiciary Committee.7 February 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYthe household has a permanent physical or mental disability. \"The present law is too restrictive,\" said Tonja Orr, director of government affairsfor the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency.\"Foster parents who want to care for a dis-abled child are being excluded.\" The bill also drops a restriction that de- fines disability as a condition that wouldotherwise require hospitalization or skillednursing care facilities. HF517 contains several other provisions and will eventually become the omnibushousing funding bill. The bill will stay in theHousing and Housing Finance Division un-til it is completed later in the session. INSURANCEINSURANCE Direct OB/GYN access A bill to forbid health insurers from re- quiring women to receive a referral in orderto see an obstetrician or gynecologist wonapproval Feb. 19 from the House Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee. HF447 , sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown), would require thatinsurance companies and health mainte-nance organizations (HMOs) allow femaleenrollees direct access to obstetricians andgynecologists. Under the bill, women would have to be allowed to schedule appointments with anobstetrician or gynecologist without priorapproval from the insurer or a referral froma \"gatekeeper\" primary care physician. \"Why shouldn't I be able to see that per- son without having to [first] see a physicianI don't even know?\" Murphy said. The bill would require that women be given direct access to an obstetrician or gy-necologist for annual examinations, any sub-sequent treatment deemed necessary by thespecialist, maternity care, and treatment ofacute or emergency conditions. Companieswould be barred from charging women extrafor direct access. The bill is necessary to protect women's \"traditional right\" of direct access, said Dr.Jan Strathy, the legislative liaison for theMinnesota Section of the American Collegeof Obstetricians and Gynecologists/Minne-sota Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Strathy stressed that the bill would not mandate any new coverage; it would simplyensure that women are not waylaid by ever-changing \"gatekeeper\" policies. \"Women should be able to choose the type of physician that will attend to theirmost intimate medical needs,\" Strathy said.Nineteen states already have laws guaran- teeing direct access to obstetricians and gy-necologists. Proposals similar to HF447 are being considered in several other states, ac-cording to Strathy. Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) told members of the committee that she was oncecharged by her insurer for an visit to anobstetrician/gynecologist because she hadnot received a referral. \"It's one thing to be able to choose out of your provider network,\" Boudreau said. \"It'sanother thing to have to get permission froma gatekeeper to see a specialist.\" The bill now moves to the House floor. LABOR On Feb. 20, one-year-old Elizabeth Krinkie, daughter of Rep. Phil Krinkie, decided that the billson her dad's desk needed more work.More coverage for diabetics Health plans would be required to pro- vide coverage for training and education toassist diabetics in managing their disease,under a bill headed for the House floor. HF653 , sponsored by Rep. Tom Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul), was approved Feb. 19by the House Financial Institutions and In-surance Committee. The bill would expand a 1994 law requir- ing medical insurance companies and healthmaintenance organizations (HMOs) to pro-vide coverage for syringes, blood-testingdevices, and other equipment diabetics need. Pugh said his bill would help to ensure diabetics know how to use the medical equip-ment and how to monitor their own condi-tion. Medical nutrition therapy would berequired to be included in health coverage, under the bill. Dr. Richard Bergenstal, executive director of the International Diabetes Center, urgedlawmakers to support the bill. If unchecked, diabetes can lead to blind- ness, kidney failure, amputation, and otherserious concerns, Bergenstal said. But, headded, early education and effort to controlthe disease can help diabetics \"at a stagewhen we can prevent many of these devas-tating complications.\" Temporary work restrictions Thousands of Minnesota companies, large and small, have come to depend on tempo-rary workers to perform a wide variety ofjobs. A bill ( HF155 ) now before the House Labor-Management Committee seeks tolimit employer use of temporary workers. In a Feb. 17 hearing, bill sponsor Rep. Mike Jaros (DFL-Duluth) said that his in-tent is to limit temporary employment in thesame position to 600 working days in a con-secutive three-year period. There would bean exemption for companies with fewer than20 employees. \"I'm not against temporary agencies or their employees; they are needed for workoverload situations,\" Jaros said. \"But frommy study, temporary workers are often usedby employers to bypass giving employment8 SESSION WEEKLY / February 21, 1997benefits. Employees with permanent jobs will be happier.\" The committee took no action on the bill.The one witness Jaros had lined up to speak for the bill, AFL-CIO PresidentBernard Brommer, did not attend themeeting. Seven witnesses did speak in opposition to the bill. Neil Clark, president of Minnesota Tech- nical Services Association, gave the panel ahandout listing myths and facts about tem-porary employment. \"There is a misconcep-tion that temporary employees get lowerwages,\" he said. \"But we must compete foremployees in the same market as everyoneelse.\" Clark said that some of his technical em- ployees have earned from $40 to $60 perhour working temporary assignments. Healso stressed that many temporary agenciesoffer employees such benefits as paid holi-days and vacations, health care, and 401kretirement plans. \"Our industry and workers are very op- posed to this bill,\" said Jackie Engmark, presi-dent of Minnesota Association of TemporaryServices and owner of an employmentagency. \"It will severely damage the tempo-rary industry in Minnesota.\" Engmark said that 55 percent of her work- ers wind up finding permanent employmentby working temporary jobs. She added that,for a variety of reasons, some workers preferto work temporary jobs. One such person is Ingrid Pasko, who has worked for Engmark's agency for more thanthree years. Pasko told the panel that, be-cause of her family, she needs the flexibilitythat temporary work offers more than thebenefits that go with a permanent job. \"Myhusband's health benefits cover us,\" she said.\"Working temp allows me to take off when Ineed to for my kids.\" Employers hire temporary workers for the flexibility and to be more honest with theircommitments to employees, said RobReinhardt of the Minnesota EmployersCouncil. \"I've been listening and have yet tohear what problem is being addressed by thislegislation. Thoughtful employers don't wantto engage in layoffs so they use temporaryworkers to fill in. The alternative is to hiremore people than you need and then have tolay them off.\" Committee Chair Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls) appointed a six-member work-ing group on HF155 to revise the bill and report back to the panel.LOCAL GOVERNMENT Police benefits A bill to ensure that peace officers disabled in the line of duty continue to receive healthcoverage for themselves and their familieswon approval from a House panel Feb. 20. \"This is an initiative that came out of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Asso-ciation,\" Dennis Flaherty, executive directorof the MPPOA, told the House Local Gov-ernment and Metropolitan Affairs Commit-tee. \"It is near and dear to our members.\" There are currently 54 former Minnesota peace officers receiving retirement pensionsafter becoming disabled by duty-related in-juries. Though they are eligible for pensions,many of these officers lost their health carebenefits once they could no longer serve aspeace officers. HF333 , sponsored by Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul), would require their previ-ous employers to provide health care cover-age. It also would extend the same coverageto the dependents of those killed in the lineof duty. A recent survey of registered voters com- missioned by the MPPOA indicated that 95percent of Minnesotans support such ben-efits for injured officers, according toFlaherty. Continuing health benefits for thefamilies of officers killed in the line of dutywas supported by 82 percent of the respon-dents. Minneapolis currently provides such cov- erage under a negotiated contract with theMinneapolis Police Federation, said JoelJamnik of the League of Minnesota Cities.St. Paul provides similar coverage to thefamilies of officers killed in the line of duty. \"The League does not support this bill,\" Jamnik said. \"These matters should be dealtwith in collective bargaining agreements ineach individual city. \"While I am sympathetic to the intent of this bill, when you get right down to it, whatyou have here is an unfunded mandate forcities and counties,\" Jamnik said. \"If you aregoing to pass this you should also providefunding.\" An average of three officers per year lose their lives in the line of duty in Minnesota,Flaherty said. Several committee members also criticized the bill for creating an unfunded mandatefor local governments. An amendment byRep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph), whichfailed, would have allowed the state to reim-burse local governments for compliance withthe law.Rep. Ron Kraus (R-Albert Lea) asked why others who risk their lives for the public suchas fire fighters and emergency medical tech-nicians aren't included in the bill. Farrellresponded that those groups could each bringforth their own legislation. HF333 now goes to the House floor. Potential government savings A bill designed to save local governments some money in publishing legal notices wonapproval from a House panel Feb. 18. For a variety of reasons, cities, townships, and counties must publish legal notices inlocal newspapers. The ads serve as publicnotice for land sales, class action lawsuits,and other government actions. Under current law, local governments can only publish such notices in newspaperswhose primary offices are within thegovernment's jurisdiction. But that limitation can cost local govern- ments more than necessary when nearbynewspapers charge substantially less for adspace. HF356 , sponsored by Rep. Mindy Greil- ing (DFL-Roseville), would allow local gov-ernments to officially designate anynewspaper with at least 25 percent of itscirculation within the government's juris-diction. A letter from the Roseville City Council detailed the problem for members of theHouse Local Government and MetropolitanAffairs Committee. \"The council designated the Roseville Review as the official newspaper for 1996, based on substantially lower cost.\" But theletter of the law required the city to select theRoseville Focus, based on the paper's office location. The restriction will cause Rosevilleto pay approximately 75 percent more, orabout $4,500, for legal notices in 1996. Joel Jamnik of the League of Minnesota Cities told the committee that his groupsupports the bill. \"It will potentially reducecosts to cities while still providing for ad-equate public notice,\" he said. Mark Anfinson, the Minnesota Newspa- per Association's attorney, said that he isgenerally supportive of the measure, whilehis organization has yet to take an officialposition. The bill now moves to the House floor.9 February 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYTAXES $ TRANSPORTATIONCutting property taxes The House Taxes Committee's Property Tax and Tax Increment Finance Divisiontook the first steps on the road toward re-forming the state's complex property taxcode Feb. 19. The division approved HF126 , sponsored by Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul),which would draw on Minnesota's projectedbudget surplus to buy down the property taxrates on commercial, industrial, and utilityproperties. Currently, the first $100,000 of such prop- erties is taxed at 3 percent, with the remain-ing value taxed at 4.6 percent. HF126 would extend the 3-percent bracket to $200,000.Commercial-industrial property in an en-terprise zone, now assessed at 2.3 percentrate on the first $50,000 and 3.6 percentbetween $50,000 and $200,000, would betaxed at 2.3 percent on the first $200,000.Property values over that amount would beassessed at the 3.6-percent rate. The state government would offset the loss of revenue to local governments, esti-mated at $26 million per year, by increasingthe amount provided through Minnesota'sHomestead Agriculture Credit Aid (HACA). HF126 would provide a 21-percent cut in property taxes to small businesses, Milbertsaid, although all businesses would feel somerelief. \"The property tax on small business is particularly high \u2014 onerously high,\" Milbertsaid, noting that small companies accountfor 94 percent of the state's total number offirms. \"This move will increase the successrate of small businesses.\" The division sent the bill, with no recom- mendation, to the full Taxes Committee forconsideration as part of the 1997 omnibustax bill. The division also approved two separate proposals: HF427 , a bill sponsored by Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) that wouldmake permanent the joint Ramsey property tax advisory committee,and HF306 . HF306 , sponsored by Rep. Edgar Olson (DFL-Fosston), would reduce the tax rate onsome rural residential apartment units from3.4 percent to 2.3 percent. The division sent both bills to the full committee.Electronic signatures The House Commerce, Tourism and Con- sumer Affairs Committee brought Minne-sota businesses one step closer to the digitalage Feb. 20, endorsing a plan to give elec-tronic signatures the full force of legal pro-tection. \"This bill is going to revolutionize busi- ness,\" Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul)said of HF56 after hearing Katie Engler of the Secretary of State's office describe the digitalencryption system. HF56 , sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) and modeled after a law set totake effect in Washington state in January1998, allows for the full authentication ofdocuments transmitted between comput-ers. The process relies on a set of two crypto-graphic key codes built around one-of-a-kindmathematical formulas known as algorithms.One key, held privately by the user, encodesdocuments with a digital signature; the otheris held in trust by a public certification au-thority and used by recipients to verify anencoded document's integrity. The bill defines the rules of the digital authentication system and mandates thatthe Secretary of State set up a transitionalpublic certification authority until privatesector firms, which would be licensed andregulated by the secretary's office, can step inand take over the verification process. HF56 also defines the range of liability assumed bythe system's subscribers and provides penal-ties for acts of fraud. Perhaps most importantly, Kahn said, the entire electronic signature system would re-main voluntary. Businesses would not berequired to participate. Moreover, the statewould not assume any financial burden be-cause the cost of doing business would beassumed by the private sector firms \u2014 whocould set whatever price the market couldbear \u2014 when they take over as certificationauthorities. Committee members, though, did not approve the bill without questioning thedegree of security provided by the encryp-tion codes. \"The whole bill is a question to me,\" said Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley). \"Myconcern is that I know how often I read in thepaper that some brilliant hacker has justcracked somebody's code.\" It seems, she continued, that every time a bold, new technological innovation comesalong, some ne'er-do-well rises to the chal-lenge and finds a way to beat the system.Other representatives felt the bill linked the process to technology that may be state-of-the-art today, but obsolete in a few years. Both concerns, Kahn said, could be ad- dressed either by the private sector firms asthey keep abreast of the developing technol-ogy or by amendment. HF56 now moves to the Governmental Operations Committee. Seat belt bill fails A proposal to give police authority to pull over motor vehicles carrying juveniles whoare not buckled up has stalled in the House. HF221 , sponsored by Rep. Jim Rhodes (R-St. Louis Park), would have requiredmotor vehicle occupants under age 18 to bewearing seat belts. The measure failed to winpreliminary approval Feb. 20 on the Housefloor. The vote was 80-48 against the bill. A provision in the bill making violations of its requirements a primary offense \u2014giving a new power to police officers \u2014 wasthe focus of criticism from several membersof the House. \"Do we want to add an additional reason why a peace officer in this state can pull overa motor vehicle?\" Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) asked. Once a vehicle is pulled over, Abrams said, police can write tickets for any offense, in-cluding the failure of adult passengers tocomply with seat belt laws. Current law requires all vehicle occupants between the ages of 3 and 11 to wear seatbelts. Rhodes' bill would have extended therequirement to include anyone between theages of 3 and 18. (Children under age 4 are required to be secured in child car seats. Occupants 18 orolder must wear seat belts only when in thefront seat.) Violation of seat belt requirements for occupants older than 3 is now a secondaryoffense. That means police can issue cita-tions only after a vehicle is stopped for amoving violation or another violation in-volving the vehicle's equipment. The bill would have allowed police to stop any vehicle in which any occupant between3 to 18 years old, whether in the front seat orback, was not using a seat belt. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) ar- gued against giving police new powers tostop vehicles just because they suspect juve-TECHNOLOGY Continued on page 1910 SESSION WEEKLY / February 21, 1997It may be that there is no single or simple way to determine the causes of crime andviolence, which, according to Dr. JamesGilligan, are of epidemic proportions inAmerican society. But Gilligan, a psychia-trist from the Harvard Medical School whohas written a book, Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and Its Causes, said there is a little- understood, overriding factor that is highlyeffective in predicting the likelihood of vio-lent behavior in individuals. Crime and violence are propelled by shame, Gilligan said. All of the known trig-gers \u2014 poverty, lack of education, childabuse, discrimination, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, lack of role models \u2014 play arole in what is governed by feelings of shame,rejection, humiliation, and degradation.\"That's the pathogen,\" Gilligan said. \"Whena person is overwhelmed by those feelings,everything else follows from that.\" Gilligan visited the Capitol on Feb. 17 and 18 to address meetings of the House Judi-ciary Committee and its Judiciary FinanceDivision, and a House-Senate meeting onthe Statewide Violence Prevention MediaCampaign. His visit was at the invitation ofRep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL Falcon Heights). Gilligan said he first learned of the impor- tance of shame in provoking criminal activ-ity in his extensive work with violent inmatesin correctional facilities. When asking pris-oners why they had committed violent actsagainst others, the consistent answer was,\"He disrespected me.\" When Gilligan askedone extremely violent inmate what he wantedso badly that he was willing to sacrifice ev-erything for it, the inmate told him \"dignityand respect.\" Social factors explain a big part of the problem. \"The biggest societal factor thatleads to violence is 'relative deprivation orpoverty,' in which an individual suffers whencompared to others in the environment whohave much more,\" Gilligan said. There is astrong correlation between the size of theincome gap between social and economicclasses and the respective rates of crime andviolence. The United States, among indus-trial nations, he said, has by far the biggestgap between the rich and poor and vastlyexceeds all other industrialized countries incrime and violence. And, he added, the gap isgrowing. Further, the numbers don't bodewell for the youngest generation of Ameri-cans. The U.S. has the highest rate of childpoverty of any industrialized country.Reasons for crime . . . Roots of violence lie in shame, economic disparity Dr. James Gilligan, author of Violence: Our Deadly Epidemic and Its Causes, spoke before the House Judiciary Committee Feb. 19 on the issues of crimeand violence. The trend bears out in examination of many countries. Consistently, Gilligan said,the bigger the income disparity, the morecrime and violence a country experiences.Sweden and Japan, for example, where eco-nomic disparity is minimal, have correspond-ingly low crime rates. A second societal factor: \"Exposing people systematically to humiliation and shamethrough discrimination \u2014 particularly ra-cial discrimination,\" Gilligan said. The ef-fects of systemic discrimination arecompounded by a lack of access to othersources of pride and self esteem, such aseducation. \"That's why education is so im-portant. The recidivism rate among prison-ers who have been given a college educationduring incarceration is far lower than that ofthose who haven't [had a college educa-tion],\" Gilligan said. Gilligan offered no easy solutions, but approaches crime and violence with a publichealth metaphor. If people are getting sickfrom contaminated water, it's more effectiveto clean up the water than to continue treat-ing only the sick individuals, he said. \"Thekey is to alter social and economic condi-tions. There simply is no more importantprincipal than an ounce of prevention isworth a pound of cure. By the time an indi-vidual becomes violent, it's too late, and a lotmore expensive.\" Prisons, Gilligan said, are useful as a meansto quarantine dangerous offenders. As puni- tive devices, however, they only lead to moreviolent individuals. \"Nothing is more usefulat stimulating violence than punishment,\"he said, while acknowledging society's justi-fiable outrage at violent crime. \"We haven'tmade up our minds as a country on whetherprisons are for rehabilitation and violenceprevention or for punishment and shame.\" Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) asked Gilligan for specifics on how his ideas cantranslate into policy. Every legislative act is related to crime and violence either directly or indirectly, Gilligansaid. \"You can't pass a law on taxes whichisn't simultaneously a law on violence,\" hesaid. Tertiary solutions \u2014 such as changeswithin prisons \u2014 are the easiest, Gilligansaid. In the middle are secondary changes,such as creating programs aimed at high-risk individuals and populations. Primarysolutions \u2014 making change at the societallevel \u2014 are hardest. \"The problem is extremely complex. There simply is no one program or panacea,\"Gilligan said. \"The major solutions, how-ever, are going to come from people like you,not me.\" \u2014 Celeste Riley Minnesota's troubled kids In 1994, 58,900 juveniles were ar- rested in Minnesota, ranking the statetenth in juvenile arrests, accordingto state information compiled inMinnesota Crime in Perspective, 1996 . Of those, 2,159 were for violentcrimes, including 34 murders, 216rapes, and 1,253 aggravated assaults. Juveniles were arrested 656 times for robbery; 17,143 times for prop-erty crimes; 2,136 times for burglary;12,637 for larceny and theft;and 2,127 times for motor vehicletheft, according to the study.11 February 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYChildren living in poverty face sub- stantially more hurdles when it comesto learning than do their better-offpeers, Sen. Paul Wellstone said to ajoint session of the Minnesota Legisla-ture Feb. 17. \"These children start life already be- hind,\" Wellstone said of the nearly200,000 Minnesota kids living at or nearthe poverty level. \"Their test scores are11 to 25 points lower . . . and they are 11times more likely to drop out of schoolthan their more affluent classmates.\" This growing \"learning gap,\" Wellstone said, threatens not onlyMinnesota's economic well-being andcriminal justice system, but the veryfabric of the American Dream. He chal-lenged policymakers to promote thegrowth of an educational environmentthat builds on a partnership betweenthe classroom, the community, and thefamily. Wellstone spoke at the invitation of House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Park). Focusing primarily onK-12 education, Wellstone endorsedstatewide testing and discouraged leg-islators from using public dollars tosupport private schools. He also calledon educators to teach a curriculum ofvalues that reflects the \"underpinningsof our democracy.\" \"I don't think anybody should be defensive about standards,\" or values,Wellstone said, adding that merely in-stalling standardized tests should notallow lawmakers to relax their commit-ment to education. \"We need to doeverything possible . . . Itcan't just be a technical fix.\" Wellstone also said the federal gov-Wellstone urges lawmakers to close 'learning gap' ernment must do a better job of fund-ing early childhood development ef-forts, including programs such asWomen, Infants and Children that pro-vide for basic nutrition before childrenstart school. Moreover, he said, initia-tives such as Head Start don't reach alleligible children. Minnesota, he said,should be proud of its Early ChildhoodFamily Education program, but shouldnot rest on its laurels. Every child shouldhave the basic tools of learning \u2014 know the alphabet and numbers, recognizecolors, etc. \u2014 before they start kinder-garten. Wellstone congratulated legislators on restoring the more than $300 million ineducational funding cuts that werescheduled to take effect this year, butpointed out that the move was not awindfall for Minnesota schools. No newmoney has been added, he said, but thecurrent budget surplus provides an ex-cellent opportunity to give schools abigger slice of the fiscal pie. He also lauded legislators for trying to simplify the complex education fund-ing mechanism and, although he en-dorsed the creation of charter schools,disagreed with the idea of public dollarsgoing to private schools, either in theform of vouchers or tax credits. Ultimately, Wellstone challenged the Legislature and the citizens of Minne-sota to become national leaders in clos-ing the learning gap. \"Minnesota should be the first state to ensure that kids come to kindergar-ten ready to learn,\" he said. \"Minnesotahas the opportunity to light a candle andlead the way. We ought to be first in thenation to move on this agenda.\" Afterwards, many legislators ex- pressed agreement with Wellstone's re-marks, although several pointed out thatin many communities, churches andother private-sector institutions havealready implemented some of his ideas.

( See related story on page 19. )12 SESSION WEEKLY / February 21, 1997A trio of prominent economists brought their perspectives to bear on thedebate surrounding the proposed publicfinancing of a new stadium for the Min-nesota Twins Feb. 14. \"Professional sports are indeed a busi- ness, and a good business . . . but thatdoesn't answer the question of whoshould pay for a new stadium,\" said Prof.Edwin Mills of Northwestern University'sKellogg School of Business, adding thatbusiness investments in America havetraditionally been a private-sector func-tion. \"Sports should be exactly that.\" Mills appeared in the state Capitol with Prof. Emeritus Wilbur Maki, of theUniversity of Minnesota's Departmentof Applied Economics, and DennisZimmerman, a specialist in public fi-nance at the Congressional Research Ser-vice in Washington, D.C. Their remarkswere part of an effort organized by FansAdvocating iNtelligent Spending Inc.(FANS Inc.), to oppose public financingfor a new Twins stadium. Gov. Arne Carlson, Twins owner Carl Pohlad, and Metropolitan Sports Com-missioner Henry Savelkoul recently un-veiled a plan to build the ball club a newstadium, complete with a retractable roof,at an estimated total cost of $350 million.The project would be financed almostcompletely with public dollars, mostlyderived from a proposed new cigarettetax (subject to the approval of the Legis-lature). Pohlad has said that without the new stadium, the Twins cannot remain fi-nancially competitive in Major LeagueBaseball and would be forced to moveout of Minnesota. Carlson has called theTwins a vital part of Minnesota'seconomy, well worth the public invest-ment. The economists, though, disputed the idea that professional sports are worthEconomists oppose public financing of new stadium such a massive public investment, pri-marily because the public doesn't benefitfrom a new stadium. \"It's my conclusion that most of the benefits of a new stadium accrue to thosewho attend the events,\" Zimmermansaid. Any funding decision for a stadium,he said, should reflect \"the benefit prin-ciple\" \u2014 that is, those who would benefitby the construction should pay for it.Zimmerman suggested raising most ofthe revenue from stadium-related activi-ties such as ticket taxes, concessions, andparking. A tax on cable TV premiumsports packages would tap those fanswho watch the games at home. If the beneficiaries of the stadium are able to shift some or all of the costs toothers, Zimmerman said, there is a temp-tation to ask for too much. \"If you don'thave to pay for ice cream, you will prob-ably eat too much,\" he said. As cities around the country have built new stadiums with public dollars, Millssaid, a number of studies have been donepurporting to show that the efforts havebrought substantial economic benefit tothe communities footing the bill. Thesestudies, he said, are deeply flawed be-cause they don't take into account repay-ment of the public subsidy. Citizens paymore taxes to cover construction, he said,so they have less money to spend onother things, \"and the benefits are justabout washed out to zero.\" For his part, Maki pointed out that the entertainment industry already gener-ates billions of dollars. Building a newstadium, he said, would merely transfermoney from one sector of the industry toanother \u2014 in this case, the Twins. \"The proper stand is to refuse to build the stadium,\" Mills said. \u2014F.

Michelle Rifenberg (R-La Crescent) would one daywind up in the Legislature. As a child she wasdrawn to politics and the political process. Her choice of televisionprogram was often po-litical in nature, and sheremembers being gluedto the national conven-tions when she was just11 years old. Even todayshe can hardly getenough of politics. \"I'm a political junkie,\" she said. \"I've always enjoyed intel-lectual debate and political discussions.\" But just ingesting the world of politics wasn't enough for Rifenberg, especially whenshe would read something in the local papersthat touched a nerve. \"I used to be one ofthose people who would fire off letters to theeditor.\" She then decided to take her principles a step further and successfully won election tothe District 32B seat, replacing 14-year vet-eran Virgil Johnson of Caledonia, Minn.Her overall outlook? \"I consider myself a mainstream conser- vative Republican. That means fiscally andsocially conservative.\" While she's political in nature, she also sees herself as a reflection of her constitu-ency, which she feels may be one of hergreatest qualifications for being a lawmaker.\"I believe in a citizen Legislature, \" she said.New members . . . Rifenberg looking to address tax, family issues \"It's important for people to know what theycan do to serve community. I enjoy servingpeople.\" For about 12 years before coming to the Legislature, Rifenberg also was active in theRepublican party, serving as county partychair for three of those years. She also campaigned for former state rep- resentative, now Congressman GilGutknecht. \"I learned I enjoyed campaign-ing. I also learned it takes lots of physicalenergy. In my own campaign I never workedon anything harder,\" she said. In the process, she learned a few things about her district, she said, which includesparts of Fillmore, Houston, and Winonacounties. Part of her mission is to changehow people are taxed. \"The people I talked with work hard for a living. They care very much about their fami-lies. They feel frustrated. The harder theywork, the more the government takes,\"Rifenberg said. \"My husband and I have setgoals. We've worked hard to meet them.Taxes and government regulation make itdifficult.\" She promises to work for some form of family tax relief. \"I particularly want to seesome of that budget surplus returned tofamilies,\" she said. Second on her list of four legislative goals is improving the climate for small businessesin rural Minnesota. A third has already beencompleted: removing current statutory capson K-12 school funding. Schools in ruralareas, she noted, are especially hard hit be- cause of the smaller property tax base. Fi-nally, Rifenberg wants to make Minnesota abetter place to raise a family. She hopes theseitems will be her legislative legacy, she said. Rifenberg's son, John, 14, \"thinks it's pretty cool\" to have mom in the House of Repre-sentatives, she said. When not preoccupiedwith the demands at the Capitol, theRifenberg family, including husband, Rob-ert, a laboratory supervisor at the Heilemandivision of the Stroh Brewery, enjoys takingfamily vacations and going to movies, shesaid. Today, she said, she's learning to feel at home in the House, is happy with her com-mittee assignments, and feels optimisticabout the session ahead. \"The new members have had a good chance to settle in, learn the process, and feel likethey belong,\" she said.

For Rep. Gary Kubly(DFL-Granite Falls), that could be tough: The first-term legislatoris also an ordainedLutheran minister. president if hethought the congrega-tion would approve ofits pastor running foroffice, and he asked me with which party,\" Kubly said, chuckling. \"Itold him \u2014 and he said he thought it wouldbe all right.\" In fact, Kubly said, his congregations in rural southwest Minnesota reacted favor-ably when he announced his candidacy forthe District 15B seat. What's more, theirsupport transcended partisan politics, hesaid, with many parishioners donating timeand money to his campaign. The first-term representative is a product of rural life. He grew up on an Iowa farm near theMinnesota border, just south of Albert Lea,Minn., where he learned firsthand about therigors that come with earning a living from theland. And although Kubly came to the TwinCities in 1970 to go to the seminary, he hasspent his professional life serving a rural flock\u2014 precisely what he hopes to accomplish as alegislator, particularly with regard to propertytax reform. The conventional wisdom, Kubly said, is that rural Minnesotans will have to shouldera larger share of the property tax burden. Hedoesn't quite see it that way. The first-termlegislator, though, enters the House as aNew members . . . Kubly vows to shepherd property tax, campaign reform strong advocate for his district. \"Over my dead body,\" he said with an air of quiet determination. \"Nobody in my dis-trict would support that . for everybody.\" Kubly's predecessor, former Rep. Roger Cooper, (DFL-Bird Island) held the seat forfive terms and was instrumental in passing anumber of programs that benefited GreaterMinnesota constituents, includingMinnesotaCare, tax breaks for ethanol plants,and better training for rural health care work-ers. Kubly, who has worked closely withfarmers over the years, campaigned \u2014 andwon \u2014 as a man who would pick up whereCooper left off. Election to the Minnesota House of Rep- resentatives is not Kubly's first foray into thepolitical realm. He challenged incumbentstate Sen. Dean Johnson (R-Willmar) for theDistrict 15 seat in 1992, coming within a fewpercentage points of beating the Senate mi-nority leader. Indeed, in the 15B area,Kubly actually finished ahead of Johnson.Yet Kubly won his House seat in 1996 by aneven narrower margin, finishing just 1.3 per-cent \u2014 a mere 202 votes \u2014 ahead of hisRepublican challenger. The contest, Kubly said, turned ugly as the campaign drew to a close. In the days leadingup to the election, the minister found him-self on the business end of a series of massmailings that allowed him no time to re-spond. Kubly also became the subject of aseries of negative advertisements that airedwell beyond the Minnesota border. \"I'm sure people in Wisconsin were won- dering what was going on when they heardpolitical ads for this race in rural Minne- sota,\" he said. As a result of the negative campaign, Kubly has come to believe campaign laws need tobe changed to prevent similar occurrences.A law could be written, he said, to prohibit acandidate from running any new advertise-ments 10 days before the election to ensurethat the person targeted would have ad-equate time to respond. \"I still believe in free speech,\" Kubly said, but something needs to be done. Although his faith serves as the founda- tion for his political ideology, Kubly said, abelief in \"a beneficent Creator \u2014 God andwhat has been done for us\" \u2014 shouldn'tpreclude the debate surrounding any issue.It's vital, he explained, that legislators allowone another the latitude to disagree, regard-less of their religious views. \"I'm not sure there is a 'Christian' posi- tion,\" Kubly said. \"It bothers me when some-one says, 'This is the Christian position.' Idon't think that there is a Christian positionon most things, anyway. There are just Chris-tians who hold views.\" \u2014 F.J.

Once a stopping point for voyageurs and fur traders, Minnesota's arrowheadregion is home to one of the state's twonational monuments. Grand Portage, on Minnesota's northeastern tip, has always attractedtravelers. In the 1700s, its location onLake Superior's North Shore near themouth of the Pigeon River made GrandPortage \u2014 or \"great north totrade for money goodsfrom the east. By the 1780s, Portage commercialnetwork that ex-tended from Londonto In those colorful days, French\"voyageurs\" manned 36-foot freight ca-noes from Montreal to mingle with In-dians and trappers at a lakeside\"rendezvous\" each summer at GrandPortage. After passing ownership from one government or business interest to thenext for more than a century, GrandPortage was finally ceded to its Indianinhabitants in the Treaty of 1854. TheOjibway community that had originallysettled in the area as fur traders duringthe 1600s became the Grand PortageBand of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe with their own 51,000-acre reservation. The band struggled on the edge of poverty for decades. With the openingof Minnesota Trunk Highway 1 in the1920s, Indian leaders realized that thehistoric location of their village couldattract tourist dollars. But the bandlacked the capital necessary to developthe site. Depression-era relief programs brought in some resources, and the North West Company depot was re-constructed in 1938 by the CivilianConservation Corps. But by 1950, thatproject had fallen into disrepair. Realizing that their lack of financial resources was causing the tourism po-tential of the site to be wasted, the bandturned to the National Park Service forhelp. In 1951, the U.S. Department ofthe Interior designated Grand Portagea National Historic Site. But little gov-ernment funding followed and the areacontinued to languish throughout the1950s. The reservation council finally decided to cede land for the historic site to thefederal government. In 1958, Congressapproved the land transfer, and in 1960,the Grand Portage National Monumentwas formally established. The first parksuperintendent arrived that year, chargedwith \"major restoration projects to trans-form the monument to its appearance of 200 years ago.\" Today, Grand Por- tage is a popular touriststop that includes a recon-struction of the old pali-sades, Great Hall, kitchen,and a number of otherbuildings, tents, and In-dian lodges. Costumed in-terpreters describe life inthe old trading post andhelp children try onvoyageur clothing. LocalOjibway arts and crafts aresold and demonstrated atthe site. The Radisson Hotel that opened nearby in1975 was taken over bythe reservation council in 1980. The band added a marina, camp-grounds, and ski trails. After gaming wasintroduced in 1990, the facility was re-named Grand Portage Lodge and Ca-sino. Each summer Grand Portage againplays host to a stream of travelers andfortune seekers, just as it did over 200years ago. NOTES When Minnesota State Auditor Judith Dutcher presented her office's 1997-98 bud-get to the House Governmental OperationsCommittee's State Government FinanceDivision Feb. 19, she noted that the requestFor detailed site information, visit the Grand Portage NationalMonument home page at: http://www.nps.gov/grpoThe Great Hall, reconstructed in 1974 on the basis of research into the design of theoriginal building, is one of the attractions at Grand Portage National Monument. contained an initiative to add a local areanetwork administrator, along with some sup-portive hardware and software. It was, shesaid, the first technological initiative theauditor's office had ever put forth. \"I think when Gov. Carlson was auditor,\" Dutcher said, \"they were still using theabacus.\"Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), though, corrected Dutcher, pointing out that sherecalled a move to update the office's tech-nology under Carlson. \"Yeah, they got a new abacus,\" said Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls).Photo courtesy The Grand Portage Story by Carolyn Gilman, Minnesota Historical Society Press.16 SESSION WEEKLY / February 21, 1997 In the Hopper . . .

Rhodes urged House members to con- sider the potential benefits of the bill. \"If this bill saves one child from beingContinued from page 9 Turn down the volume A booming bass line could bring motor- ists a costly fine, under a bill approved Feb.17 by the House Transportation and TransitCommittee. Bill sponsor Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), a Minneapolis police officer, saidloud car stereos frequently disturb the peacein many neighborhoods.\"I hope strict enforcement of this [pro- posed] statute will help curtail this prob-lem,\" he said. \"This is one of thosequality-of-life issues that I think is an excel-lent use of police resources.\" Stanek's bill ( HF86 ) would allow police to ticket motorists who play their car stereos ata volume that \"unreasonably disturbs thepeace and quiet of a person nearby.\" Specifically, a violation would occur if sound from a radio, tape, or compact discplayer is \"plainly audible\" at a distance of 50feet or more from a vehicle. Violators wouldface a petty misdemeanor charge, which car-ries a fine of up to $200. Stanek said the residents of the neighbor- hoods where he works frequently complainabout the racket coming from passing cars,regardless of the motorists taste in music. \"I'm not going to discriminate betweenrap and country music,\" Stanek said. \"I'll tag equally for both.\" Excessively loud car stereos can also create a hazard on the road, according to Stanek. \"If you've got that car stereo turned up, sometimes you can't hear an emergency ve-hicle as you are traveling down the road-way,\" he said. Several cities, including Minneapolis and St. Paul, already have ordinances related toloud car stereos. Stanek's bill would providea statewide standard for car stereo use, but itwould not prohibit cities from enactingtougher ordinances. The bill also would provide exceptions for devices producing loud but necessary sounds,such as car alarms and police sirens.

Brioschi died last week at the age of 89 years. Amidst the hubbub of daily life around the Capitol, his death mostly went unnoticed. Amerigo and his father, Carlo, an Italian immigrant, were the sculptors of the most prominentwork of art in the House chamber, \"Minnesota, Spirit of Government,\" some 25 feet above the House speaker's desk. Seven years ago, Brioschi came to the Capitol for one of his last visits to the House chamber, and was present for its March 13, 1990, restoration celebration. His autograph from that significant day appears on the cover of this week's Session Weekly. During another restoration of the chamber 59 years ago, Amerigo and his father were commissioned by the State Emergency Relief Administration to design statuary for a wall that would enclose a former visitors' gallery to createoffice space. Carlo, who died March 27, 1941, was the artist who, in 1931, designed \"With Ethnic Pride,\" the Christopher Columbus statue on the Capitol lawn that facesthe State Judicial Center. (Some 25,000 people were on hand for the dedication in 1931.) Amerigo's statue of Floyd B. Olson was erected in 1958. It is located directly west of his father's work\u2014 across the lawn in front of the State OfficeBuilding. The pioneering spirit of the Brioschis is depicted in the theme of their artwork and in its trompe l'oeil effect \u2014 deceiving illusions of two-dimensional blending into three-dimensional figures. Their monumental tribute to Minnesota's early residents and its government is highly visible to all who enter the chamber. The Spirit of Government serves as a reminder to the diversity of its people, the natural richness of the territory, and a strong belief in a government \". . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" On their patterned gilded wall behind the painted and sculptured plaster are the words: VOX POPULORUM EST VOX DEI \u2014 \"the Voice of the People is the Voice of God.\" And so, Amerigo and Carlo Brioschi, your outstanding works do not go unnoticed; they are an integral part of Minnesota's rich history, and are muchappreciated. \u2014 LeClair G. Lambert3 February 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . Feb. 20 - 27, 1997 Highlights Momentum is growing to open juvenile court proceedings \u2014 and records \u2014 to thepublic. On Feb. 26, the House Judiciary Com-mittee approved a bill for a pilot program toopen juvenile court proceedings in HennepinCounty, the busiest of the state's judicialdistricts. HF254 would open hearings involving children in need of protection services(CHIPS), a legal distinction that refers tochildren who have been exposed to abuse orneglect. Such cases are among the most se-vere in the juvenile court system. The pilotprogram would be in effect from Jan. 1,1998, to Aug. 1, 2000. About 1,200 CHIPScases are tried each year in the HennepinCounty District Court. Additional bills sponsored by committee chair Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL Mpls) wouldopen most other areas of juvenile proceed-ing, such as delinquency proceedings, andrecords. No action has been taken onSkoglund's bills. The issue has generated strong feelings on both sides of the debate. \"If the public had any idea of the kind of decisions being made for these vulnerable Juvenile court . . . Public hearings \u2014 saving or shaming children? children, the public would be outraged. Iam,\" Heidi Schellhas, a judge in HennepinCounty District Court, told the committee.\"Children aren't being protected by closedproceedings; adults are.\" Hennepin County Attorney Mike Free- man agreed. \"One reason we close the hearings is be- cause society is uncomfortable with whatgoes on in those courtrooms,\" he said. \"Themost compelling issue is to get the commu-nity to participate in setting the standardsfor what happens in this very difficult area. Too often we intervene way too late.\" Others fear that opening the courts will expose children to further trauma and shame.Tamara Malik, a child protection worker,spoke of a case in which a girl was taunted atschool after it became known she had beensexually abused by her father. The father losthis job, and the mother abandoned the fam- \"The most compelling issue is to get the community to participate in setting the standards for what happens in this very difficult area. Too often we intervene way too late.\" \u2014Hennepin County Attorney Mike FreemanThe effort to shed light on the closed world of juvenile court is, in part, a response to arecent report from a Minnesota SupremeCourt task force that recommended open-ing the proceedings unless there are \"excep-tional circumstances.\" Skoglund and Schellhas also joined a group last August that visited Wayne County, Mich.,which includes the Detroit area, where thejuvenile court system is open for all to view. \"We talked to all the players,\" Schellhas said. \"We wanted to hear problems. Wethought our credibility would be hurt if wecame back with only pros. But there were nocons.\" Skoglund said there were no problems in opening the system. Family members whofelt locked out of the closed system nowparticipate and observe. \"None of the fearsabout opening the system have been met. . .. We met with social workers, probationofficers, referees [judges], court administra-tors, reporters. Every single person said thesystem was improved by being open,\"Skoglund added. \"They said it has made lifebetter for kids in desperate need of help.\" Michigan and Oregon currently are the only states with open systems; Pennsylvaniaand Arizona are experimenting with pilotsystems, and other states are exploring theissue, Skoglund said. Under current Minnesota law, all juvenile ily. \"It's wrong to drag family crises to whereschool classes and neighbors can sit andlisten,\" she said. Fred Friedman, a public defender in Duluth, didn't want the names of juveniles to show upin the local papers. While major daily newspa-pers may honor an agreement to not publishchildren's names, it can't be assumed that ev-ery small community paper will do the same.\"It would be a huge mistake to put names in thepapers,\" he said. \"We're talking about ne-glected and dependent children.\"Several court officials testified before the House Judiciary Committee Feb. 26 in favor of a bill that wouldopen juvenile court proceedings and records to the public. Pictured, left to right, are Hennepin County District Court Judge Heidi Schellhas, Minnesota Court of Appeals Chief Judge Edward Toussaint Jr., andMinnesota Supreme Court Associate Justice Kathleen Blatz.4 SESSION WEEKLY / February 28, 1997BUSINESSSALES CHILDRENproceedings are closed. Judges also can close proceedings in other courts at their discre-tion, which HF254 would not change. (Cam- eras are not allowed in any Minnesotacourtroom.) Rep. Andy Dawkins, (DFL-St. Paul.) asked what was wrong with the current juvenilecourt system. \"Is it shoddy proceedings? Lackof resources? No funds for public with child protection workers?\" \"All of the above,\" Schellhas said, adding that without public awareness, the Legisla-ture cannot get the support to make neces-sary changes. Skoglund said that abuses do occur under the current system, and cited a case in whicha judge kicked a child during a court pro-ceeding. \"The point is to raise the account-ability of the people within the system. It's tomake it more difficult for adults to fail chil-dren. As it is now, if they make a mistake, noone knows.\" Minnesota Supreme Court Associate Jus- tice Kathleen Blatz said those outside thecourt system need to demand informationand monitor the statistics. \"We don't get changes because we don't get the data. We need fresh air in the sys-tem.\" With closed proceedings, children are\"second-class citizens,\" she added, becausethey get less protection. \"The biggest reasonwe continue to close them is [because] that'show it's always been done.\" Only a small fraction \u2014 and the most severe \u2014 of the almost 40,000 cases referredto child protection agencies each year evermake it to court, Blatz said. And the natureof those cases remains a mystery to mostcitizens. \"The public at large doesn't know the gravity of the child welfare crisis,\" said MarkToogood, a guardian ad litem, or advocatefor children during court proceedings.\"You've heard the horror stories. What youdon't know is now pervasive it is. If some-thing dramatic doesn't happen, the future ofour society is in question. There are stormclouds on the horizon.\" Media scrutiny can only serve to improve the situation, he said. \"The media spotlight galvanized the pub- lic against [the problem of] battered women.Children deserve the same protection.\" Esther Wattenberg, director of the Center for Advanced Studies in Child Welfare, spokeon behalf of the minority on the state Su-preme Court task force opposed to openingthe system. \"The notion is absurd that mediascrutiny will help abused children,\" she said.\"Opening the courts has made no differencein Michigan's staggering child welfare sys-tem.\"Opening the hearings to the public is a distraction from the problems that plaguethe child welfare system,\" she added, andwill have a chilling effect on reporting bywelfare workers reluctant to expose childrento further harm. HF254 now heads to the House floor. \u2014 Celeste Riley Protecting payroll The House Commerce, Tourism and Con- sumer Affairs Committee recently moved toprotect businesses from unscrupulous pay-roll service firms. \"HF238 addresses an area that is long overdue for regulation \u2014 payroll servicecompanies,\" said bill sponsor Rep. PeggyLeppik (R-Golden Valley). \"This bill willbecome a model for the rest of the country.\" Many small businesses use payroll firms instead of going to the expense of hiringtheir own payroll staff. The firms issue checksto employees and make income and othertax payments to the government. Leppik's bill emerged after a number of payroll service companies declared bank-ruptcy, including one highly publicized ac-tion by Edina-based CFS Office Automationin 1996. CFS, now the subject of an Internal Rev- enue Service criminal investigation, facesaccusations that it defrauded more than 200clients of nearly $6 million in payroll taxpayments. All of CFS's clients, along with thecustomers of the other bankrupt payroll ser-vices, remained liable for the tax payments,despite the fact that CFS told its clients thepayments had been made. HF238 would protect small businesses from such fraudulent practices, Leppik said,by requiring payroll service companies toregister with the Department of Revenue.The companies would have to furnish thedepartment with a monthly updated clientlist, make all tax payments electronically,and prove that all their customers' money iskept separately from the firms' operatingfunds. The revenue department would in turn notify clients directly that their payroll com-pany had not made payments and that theclient is still responsible for the taxes. Thedepartment, under the bill, also could penal-ize firms that don't comply with the law,either by suspending or revoking their regis-tration or assessing a fine of up to $5,000 foreach violation.Most payroll services don't charge their clients directly for their work, Leppik said.Rather, they make their money by investingthe client's tax payments and keeping thereturn. HF238 also mandates that the rev- enue department notify clients of this prac-tice and at the same time inform them thatno state agency regulates the payroll ser-vices' financial solvency. The Commerce, Tourism and Consumer Affairs Committee approved the bill, whichwould take effect on Jan. 1, 1998, and sent itto the House Taxes Committee. Placing wards of the state The more than 1,700 children who are wards of the state may have their adoptionodds increased under a bill approved by theHouse Health and Human Services Com-mittee Feb. 25. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior), would allow the Departmentof Human Services to contract with licensed,private adoption agencies to find homes forthese children. Currently, county agencies are respon- sible for placing these children in adoptivehomes. But too many county caseworkersare too busy responding to crisis child pro-tection and abuse cases to have enough timeto find adoptive homes, according to ErinSullivan Sutton, interim director of thedepartment's family and children servicesdivision. As a result, 40 percent to 60 percent of these children do not get adopted, ever, ac-cording to the department. The intent of HF185 is to have private adoption agencies help counties in the effortto find adoptive homes for children, not toreplace county workers. Some counties havededicated staffers working on adoptions,some do not, Sullivan Sutton said. Rep. Luanne Koskinen (DFL-Coon Rap- ids) successfully amended the bill to statethat any state contract with a private adop-tion agency \"must be designed to supple-ment existing county efforts, and shall notreplace existing county programs\" unlessthe county agrees. Children who are wards of the state come from different backgrounds and their par-ents have relinquished their parental rights.Many were neglected, physically abused, orsexually abused. Some came from parents5 February 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY who were incapacitated. Of the 1,700 chil- dren, some are being considered by familiesfor adoption but nothing has been finalized.As of January, however, no one had shownan interest in 813 of those children. Another section of the bill would allow the Department of Human Services to encour-age local reforms in child welfare services byauthorizing local pilot programs. Some ideasinclude developing a program to better iden-tify which children are at risk and may needprotection down the road. Another idea maybe to develop an early intervention programthat brings help into a child's home before amajor abuse or neglect situation erupts. Another provision would give individuals whom the department determines have, infact, abused a child a chance to appeal duringan agency hearing. That is, only if the abusecase is not pending before a juvenile court oradult criminal court. Currently, the only recourse for people who believe they have been falsely found tohave mistreated a child is to file a data prac-tices complaint to get the department recordstricken. HF185 now moves to the House Health and Human Services Finance Division. Childhood delinquency Troubled children who are likely to en- gage in an escalating pattern of crime andviolence can be identified early, according toa study presented to the House JudiciaryFinance Division Feb. 25. In January 1995, the Hennepin County Attorney's Office began studying 134 chil-dren under the age of 10 who reportedlycommitted 147 crimes, including criminalsexual conduct, assault, arson, shoplifting,theft, burglary, and damage to property. The children were not arrested because Minnesota law does not allow for the arrestof a child under 10 years old. The report, funded by a $450,000 legisla- tive appropriation, concludes that childrenwho are likely to continue a pattern of crimi-nal and violent behavior can be identifiedthrough the presence of a combination ofpredictors. They include: early encounters with police; the presence of abuse, neglect, violence, or criminal activity in the home; poor school attendance and/or school failure; an absence of positive relationships with adults and peers; and overall problems in family daily function- ing, based on factors such as single-parenthood, the number of other children in the home, and the age of the parent(s). The goal of the study is to establish new prevention programs, including one whichpairs police officers with troubled childrento provide guidance. The study is believed to be the only one of its kind in the country, according to JanetWiig, assistant Hennepin County attorney.New groups of young children are studied asthe members of the original group reachage 10. Of the original study group, 44 have been referred to the criminal justice system forprosecution for additional crimes. Of those,half committed at least one new offenseagainst a person. According to Wiig, thefrequency and severity of the crimes are ris-ing with the children's ages.\"It's those with the worst profiles who are coming back,\" Wiig said. The study was commended by Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), chair of the JudiciaryCommittee. \"These kids said. \"I hope we them.\" CRIME Morgan Jellison, a 3-year-old from Minneapolis,played hide-and-seek with other children Feb. 21during Family Day on the Hill, an event sponsoredby the Gay and Lesbian Community ActionCouncil.Guns in kids' hands Acquiring a gun is like \"ordering pizza,\" a juvenile with an arrest record told a jointhearing of the House Judiciary Committeeand Senate Crime Prevention CommitteeFeb. 21. The committee met to considerways to control escalating violence, espe-cially gun violence, among youth in Minne-sota, and strategies that have been successfulin other regions. Key testimony came from David Kennedy, a Harvard University senior research analystand the director of a successful youth vio-lence intervention program in Boston thatresulted in a dramatic reduction in gun vio-lence. During a six-year period, the Boston Gun Project reported a drop in homicides amongvictims age 24 and under from 30 in 1990 tonine in 1996, and a citywide drop from 40victims in 1990 to 16 in 1996. Kennedy explained that the project first examined the routes by which guns cameinto the hands of youths, and learned thatstopping the flow of illegal guns is a weaklink in law enforcement. \"Curiously, that is the part of the problem we have the least focus on. Gun crimes \u2014yes, but gun trafficking \u2014 no,\" Kennedysaid. \"We wanted to make that part of regu-lar police business.\" The project traced everygun recovered from suspects under age 21. \"How closely is the illegal gun trade scru- tinized?\" Kennedy asked. \"It's scrutinized sotightly that the perpetrators innewspapers and magazines. Rep. MattEntenza (DFL-St. Paul) suggested legisla-tion to prosecute those who sell guns whichare later used in crimes. Second, the project in Boston mobilized community agencies to strictly enforce thelaw. The offending youths \u2014 mostly gangmembers well-known to police \u2014 werethreatened with sanctions that the agencieswere prepared to impose against anyone whocommitted a violent act. After followingthrough a few times, the problems stopped,Kennedy said. In effect, \"we told them tostop,\" he explained, and they did. Boston6 SESSION WEEKLY / February 28, 1997 subsequently experienced its lowest homi- cide rate since the 1960s, Kennedy said. Committee members debated whether their focus should be on stopping the flow ofguns or exploring the causes of youth crime.Several juveniles with police records testi-fied. A recurring theme: Perpetrators are notsufficiently penalized. \"I've had 25 arrests and haven't spent a day of my life in jail,\" a young man told thejoint committee. \"When you catch some-one, do something \u2014 not just probation ortreatment.\" \"It's how you punish juveniles,\" another told the committee. \"I could say 'Sorry, Ihave a problem with drugs or gangs,' and I'dget a fourth, fifth, or sixth chance, or I'd gettreatment.\" He said it wasn't until he reached\"extended jurisdiction juvenile\" status, a last-chance designation meaning he would betreated as an adult upon the next arrest, thathe stopped offending, he said. \"You guysown my butt,\" he said. Another juvenile told law enforcers: \"As soon as you stopped watching me, I'd goback to the gang.\" In 1995, Minneapolis recorded 17 fire- arms-related deaths of juveniles age 17 andyounger, and six in 1996, during a record-breaking year in which 97 homicides oc-curred. An estimated 2,668 juveniles weremurdered in the U.S. in 1994, 20 percent ofthem by other juveniles. Inmates to share cells The House Feb. 27 approved a bill that would require most inmates sent to a newprison planned for Rush City, Minn. todouble up in their cells. The vote was 127-3. HF268 repeals a statute that requires in- mates be placed in separate cells wheneverspace allows in prisons with a security levelsimilar to that of the planned Rush Cityprison. On a scale of 1 to 6 \u2014 6 being amaximum-security prison \u2014 the Rush Cityprison would be a 4. The bill also reverses anearlier requirement specific to the Rush Cityprison that it be designed with mostly singleoccupancy units. The bill now requires the opposite: that the new facility provide multiple-occupancycells \"to the greatest extent possible.\" Theresult is that only one-seventh of the beds atRush City will be in single-occupancy cells. The construction plans were revised so that the prison could be built within the $89million budget the Legislature appropriated.\"They would have had to give up too muchprogramming, common, recreational, andeducational space,\" said Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown). Murphy said that Department of Correc- tions officials have said that they can managesecurity in the double-occupancy facility. Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) of- fered an amendment that would have pro-hibited the plan at Rush City. \"We all knowof the need for additional bed space in ourprisons. But the issues of safety of the guardsand inmates; the implications for lawsuits asa result of assaults; and the cost of recidivismto society\" have not been adequately exam-ined, Paymar said. The amendment failed118-12. The new plan calls for three \"pods\" with 136 double-occupancy cells in each, and onepod with 136 single-occupancy units. Thedouble-occupancy cells would measure 84.2square feet. The new design would increasethe facility's capacity to 952 inmates, upfrom 800. The earlier plan had called for six single- occupancy pods. The two pods not requestedin this latest proposal could be added later ifneeded. HF268 now moves to the Senate. State Patrol officers arrested a welfare rights demonstrator after about 35 people refused to leave the State Capitol rotunda at closing Feb. 26. The protesters rallied against cuts in welfare benefitsfor nearly seven hours.DEVELOPMENT Coordinated land planning Urban sprawl has been gobbling up open land on the edges of the Twin Cities metro-politan area for decades. But now it is takingsubstantial bites out of Minnesota's ruralareas as well. Statewide, urban developmentconsumes about 68 acres per day.Since the mid 1970s, the Metropolitan Council has planned and shaped develop-ment in the seven-county metropolitan area.The council periodically reviews its Metro-politan Urban Service Area (MUSA) bound-ary. Inside the boundary, new developmentis provided with municipal utility servicessuch as roads, water, and sewer. Outside theMUSA, development is more restricted andreceives no such services. A bill ( HF217 ) discussed \u2014 but not voted on \u2014 Feb. 25 by the House Local Govern-ment and Metropolitan Affairs Committeeattempts to curtail sprawl in the rest of Min-nesota. The bill provides the legal frame-work and funding for state-mandatedcomprehensive planning in rural counties,cities, and townships under the jurisdictionof the Minnesota Environmental QualityBoard (EQB). Bill sponsor Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud) explained that developers are cur-rently avoiding the restrictions imposed onthem by the Metropolitan Council and arebuilding in the surrounding counties. Thesedevelopments often take the form of high-priced housing on five-acre plots of formerfarm land. \"We like the Twin Cities,\" \"But we want you [residents] to staywhere you are.\" Projections are that central Minnesota will get 100,000 new residents in the next decade,Opatz told the panel. \"We will consume 25square miles of open space. We have no planfor all of that growth.\" Opatz said that local government officials are often reluctant to restrict land use whena friend, family member, or neighbor hassomething to gain from a new development.7 February 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYA Chisago County resident confirmed Opatz's view. \"Chisago County already has acomprehensive plan with wonderful goalswhich are supported by the public,\" BillNewman said. \"But developers put a lot ofpressure on our local officials. Unsustainedgrowth is being subsidized by the rest of uswho have to pay for it.\" HF217 would require all Minnesota coun- ties outside the Metropolitan area to submitcomprehensive land-use plans to the EQB.The plans must conform to 12 broad goalsfor sustainable development outlined in thebill. Counties with a population density greater than 50 people per square mile and gainingpopulation at a rate faster than the state as awhole would be considered \"growth\" coun-ties. In growth counties, any land not in-cluded within a city municipal plan wouldbe zoned as permanent agricultural land.Developments in such counties would belimited to one dwelling unit per 40 acres.Seven counties \u2014 Benton, Chisago, Isanti,Olmsted, Sherburne, Stearns, and Wright \u2014would currently qualify as growth counties. Under the bill, any municipality that does not submit a comprehensive plan to itscounty board would have a plan preparedfor it by the county. If a county board doesnot submit a plan to the EQB, the EQBwould prepare a plan for the county. Representing the Coalition of Greater Minnesota Cities, Dave Olson said, \"We'revery pleased to see this debate move forward.Statewide planning is important but must becoordinated.\" \"Builders have long advocated for good planning,\" said Gary Laurent of the BuildersAssociation of Minnesota in offering quali-fied support for the bill. Growth boundariescan drive up the cost of land and planning isbest done at the local level, he said. Officials from the Minnesota Association of Realtors and the Metropolitan Councilalso spoke in favor of the bill. The bill also will appropriate an unspeci- fied amount to the EQB for planning grantsto local governments. The committee's hearing on HF217 will continue March 4.Recycling polluted lands Revenue now used to clean up old tire dumps would instead be channeled into re-claiming contaminated land under legisla-tion approved Feb. 26 by the Economic Development and International Trade Com-mittee. Under current law, the state attaches a $4 fee on the transfer of motor vehicles and usesthe proceeds to dispose of used tires. The fee,which generates nearly $4 million annually,is set to expire on July 1. HF422 would extend the fee indefinitely and allow localgovernments to direct the money insteadtoward the rehabilitation of contaminatedsites, known as \"brownfields,\" once occu-pied by businesses such as auto salvage yards.The sites, in turn, could be used for expand-ing light industry businesses. The move, billsponsor Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-NorthSt. Paul) said, would allow communities todevelop land that was once useless. \"It's cost effective to recycle and reclaim this land,\" McCollum said, adding thatmanufacturers could expand into an areaalready supported by an infrastructure in-stead of locating in the suburbs, far frompotential new employees. \"It fits in wonder-fully with welfare reform.\" Other legislators, while supportive of the bill, questioned how much control the statewill be able to exercise over the disposition ofbrownfields. \"Land that is being used for light indus- trial purposes doesn't need to be clean enoughto grow organic vegetables for small chil-dren,\" said Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls).\"We need to take a sensible approach [as] tohow clean is clean.\"EDUCATIONSCHOOL Sandra Ebensteiner, holding sign , and \"Dr. I. Kleendirt,\" played by Sharon Horgan, who carried a container of dry ice representing pollution, performed a skit about \"brownfields\" before the EconomicDevelopment and International Trade Committee Feb. 26. Several groups joined forces to push for statemoney to help clean up vacant contaminated industry sites to make room for new businesses and newjobs. The skit was presented by Interfaith Action and the St. Paul Ecumenical Alliance of Congregations. That approach, Kahn said, could be hin- dered by an overzealous and inflexible fed-eral Environmental Protection Agency. HF422 now moves to the House Local Government. and Metropolitan Affairs Com-mittee. Pass or don't drive Proponents of a proposal that would link teen driving privileges to academic perfor-mance say the bill would help motivate stu-dents. HF446 , sponsored Rep. Len Biernat (DFL- Mpls), would require Minnesotans underage 18 to pass high school graduation testsand to stay in school to be eligible to receivea driver's license. \"I think this sends a strong message to students that education is important, thesetests are important, and we want you topass,\" Biernat said during a Feb. 27 HouseEducation Committee hearing. Under the bill, which was not acted upon, public school students would have to fulfillexisting driver's education requirements andpass the state's basic skills tests in math andreading in order to be issued a driver's li-cense. Math and reading tests, required under Minnesota's graduation rule, are first givento students in eighth grade, when most stu-dents are 14 years old. Students who fail oneor both of the tests are given another chanceto pass at least once each school year. Exceptions to the academic requirements could be made for special-needs students, Note: The cover photo illustrationon the Feb. 21, 1997, issue of theSession Weekly was rendered by Andrew Von Bank. His name wasinadvertently omitted in the lastissue.8 SESSION WEEKLY / February 28, 1997under the bill. Private school students, who are not required to take the state's basic skillstests, would simply be required to documentenrollment in school. The bill also provides that the state could suspend the license of anyone under age 18who drops out of school or is a habitualtruant. Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake), who is co-sponsoring the bill, is a high schoolteacher and a driver's education instructor, ajob he has performed for more than 25 years. He said the bill aims to direct some of the enthusiasm students have for driver's edu-cation to their regular school work. \"It's unbelievable, the desire a youngster has to get that [learner's] permit,\" Maressaid. Mares also pointed out that academic per- formance is already linked to other privi-leges. Students must meet academicrequirements to participate in extra-curricu-lar activities such as sports, and insurancecompanies give better rates to students withgood grades. \"In the long run, this [bill] would raise the educational skills of our young people,\"Mares added. In 1988, West Virginia became the first state to adopt a similar so-called \"no-pass,no-drive\" law. Such laws are increasinglypopular and are now on the books in a totalof 15 states, including Wisconsin. HF446 received support from school offi- cials who testified during the hearing. Requiring students to pass the basic skills test to get a driver's license would give schoolwork \"a direct tie to something important inthe lives of students, said Dr. Ray Hoheisel,superintendent of the Cambridge-IsantiSchool District. \"This bill can make a difference,\" he said. \"It can help improve the overall learning ofa good number of students.\" Some lawmakers expressed concerns about the impact the bill would have on special-needs students and others struggling to makeit academically. \"It's just an awful lot of pressure,\" said Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee). \"I thinkthere are some marginal kids under a lot ofpressure in different ways, and this may begoing too far.\" HF446 will be discussed further by the Education Committee on March 4. ENVIRONMENTAlternative school schedules The House Education Committee ap- proved a bill Feb. 25 that would make iteasier for school districts to establish year-round school or other alternative schedules. HF302 , sponsored by Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), would do awaywith a requirement in current law that makesdistricts receive the approval of the StateBoard of Education before establishing aflexible learning year program at a particularschool. Such a program could include a four-day school week or an elimination of the tradi-tional summer vacation in favor of classesfor 45 out of every 60 days. Under current law, a district wishing to establish a flexible learning year for a schoolsite must submit an application to the Boardof Education, which has authority to reviewthe plans and approve or disapprove. Greiling's bill would give local school dis- trict officials the authority to establish a flex-ible learning year and relegate the Board ofEducation to a supervisory role. The state board would retain responsibil- ity for setting standards for flexible learningyear programs, and those standards wouldrequire all programs to meet state require-ments for testing and reporting. \"We feel that it is a nice balance,\" said Marsha Gronseth, executive director of theBoard of Education. \"It's probably the schooldistricts that should be making the decision.\" HF302 now goes to the House floor. Snowmobile safety Snowmobile safety concerns continue to stir up a flurry of legislative initiatives at thestate Capitol. One bill, the Joshua Renken and Stacy Schlosser Snowmobile Safety Act ( HF770 ), named in honor of two young Minnesotanswho lost their lives after being struck bysnowmobiles this season, won approval froma House panel Feb. 21. The bill's sponsor, Rep. Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby), accompanied by thechildren's mothers, Lori Renken and JanSchlosser, spoke before the House Environ-ment and Natural Resources Committee onFeb. 19 and 21. \"I have been working on this bill for five years,\" said Hasskamp. \"It is the least wecould do to name it for the two young peoplewho lost their lives totally unnecessarily.\"The bill would impose a number of changes in current snowmobile laws. It requires thatregistration applications contain the legalname and address of every owner of thesnowmobile. Current practice allows the useof nicknames and initials on registrationforms, Hasskamp said. The bill also requiresthat registration numbers be clearly and vis-ibly affixed to the snowmobile. Manysnowmobilers now use fancy lettering tomatch their machine's logo style. Law en-forcement officials find the wide variety oflettering styles often difficult to read, espe-cially at high speeds. Registration fees alsowould be doubled from $30 for three years to$60. Persons operating a snowmobile with an engine displacement of more than 440 cubiccentimeters would be required to possess avalid driver's license. Jan Schlosser had asked the committee to consider lowering the nighttime snowmo-bile speed limit to 30 miles per hour, downfrom the current 50 miles per hour maxi-mum on public lands and waters. HF770 proposes that, and would prohibit operatinga snowmobile in a \"careless, reckless, or neg-ligent manner so as to endanger the personor property of another or to cause injury ordamage.\" The bill also allows counties, cities, and townships to set a snowmobile speed limitthat is 10 miles per hour below the postedmaximum for automobile traffic. \"We need more enforcement in rural ar- eas so that we can stop these people[snowmobilers] who use rural streets andcounty roads,\" Jan Schlosser told the panel.\"That's where the problem is at.\" The Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and local snowmobile groups thatreceive state grants-in-aid would be chargedwith posting and improving safety signageon snowmobile trails, under the bill. Cur-rent trail posting and signs is inadequate,according to Hasskamp and Mike Grupa, ofthe DNR's enforcement division. \"There area lot of blind hills and curves that are verydangerous,\" Hasskamp said. Funds from the snowmobile trails and enforcement account would be allocatedaccording to a new formula with 50 percentgoing for the state's grant-in-aid trail pro-gram which makes grants to local snowmo-bile clubs for trail grooming. Another 25percent would go to maintain the state's ownrecreational snowmobile trails. The final 25percent would be earmarked for snowmo-bile enforcement purposes. The DNR wouldapportion some of the enforcement funds tolocal and county law enforcement agencies.

HF770 now goes to the House Environ- ment and Natural Resources Finance Com-mittee. Changes to state parks Land would be added to four state parks, an additional park would get a new name,and another would be allowed to sell beer inits lodge, under a bill being considered by theLand Sales Subcommittee of the House En-vironment and Natural ResourcesCommittee. Sponsor Rep. Thomas Bakk (DFL-Cook) presented the bill ( HF299 ) Feb. 25. It would authorize the Department of Natural Re-sources (DNR) to add land to the followingstate parks: Bear Head Lake State Park in St. Louis County would add 160 acres of adjacentundeveloped land, wooded with maturered and white pine trees. The additionwould prevent a proposed housing devel-opment near the Taconite State Trail. Forestville State Park in Fillmore County would get an adjacent 40-acre parcel onthe south branch of the Root River. Theriver is a designated trout stream and thesurrounding bluffs contain excellent habi- tat for the endangered timber rattlesnake. John Latsch State Park in Winona County would gain access to the Mississippi Riverwith a 120-acre parcel that includes pri-vately owned water access, a resort, andcampground. Split Rock Lighthouse State Park in Lake County would acquire 80 acres of landalong the Lake Superior shore northeast ofthe park. The land is currently owned bythe Congdon family and includes GoldRock Point, the largest of the few exposedgranite cliffs on the North Shore. It alsocontains 3,700 feet of lake shore and accessto the Madeira shipwreck, one of the mostpopular diving sites in the Great Lakes. The bill also seeks to change the name of O.L. Kipp State Park in Winona County toGreat River Bluffs State Park. Bill Morrissey,director of the DNR's Parks and RecreationDivision, explained that O.L. Kipp is the firststate park encountered by travelers enteringthe state from the east on Interstate 90. \"It isour gateway park, and the current namedoesn't attract people,\" Morrissey said.\"Great River Bluffs is a more descriptivename that we believe will attract more tour-ists to the park.\" Other provisions of the bill would allow Itasca State Park in Clearwater County toadd beer to the wine menu in its restaurant.And visitors to Tettegouche State Park wouldbe allowed to use the parking lot for onehour without buying a state park permit. No action was taken on the bill, which will be discussed further in the weeks ahead. Revenue building In 1988, Minnesota's Department of Rev- enue moved its hundreds of employees, alongwith all of its computers, furniture, and files,into a new building on the banks of theMississippi River. The state, however, did not own the struc- ture. St. Paul's JLT Group owns it. The realestate company rented the space to the rev-enue department, offering a five-year leasethat also contained five, one-year options torenew the agreement. Now, nearly 10 years later, the depart- ment has outgrown the space at 10 RiverPark Plaza. In fact, according to a reportwritten by the SGS Group, consultants theLegislature hired to study the idea of a newrevenue building, the department will needeven more space by 2010, when it has nearly1,500 employees. Unfortunately, said Jim Steinmann of SGS, the final one-year renewal expires Nov. 30,1998, putting the Legislature in what is anuncomfortable position: begin constructionon a new building or purchase and renovatethe existing one. Either way, he said, eachmonth that the Legislature delays a decisioncould cost the state as much as $1 million inincreased rent and future construction costs. Rent would likely increase under a rene- gotiated lease. \"The timing is critical because . . . the solutions that are available to you may not beable to be done\" by the time the state's leaseexpires on the current revenue building,Steinmann said. \"The state does not have acomfortable time frame.\" Steinmann, along with Carl Remick of the Minneapolis-based Architectural Alliance,presented their findings to a joint meeting ofthe Senate Governmental Operations andVeterans Affairs Committee, the Senate Gov-ernmental Operations Budget Division, theHouse State Government Finance Division,and the House Capital Investment Commit-tee Feb 25. The Department of Revenue moved from the Centennial Building in the Capitol com-plex to River Park Plaza in December 1988.That first year, the department paid JLT $3.6million in rent. Over the years, the amountof rent paid to JLT grew \u2014 by about 7percent annually \u2014 even as the departmentitself did. Now, according to the Depart-ment of Administration, the state pays JLT$6.3 million per year for the 299,000 squarefeet that house its 1,369 employees.10 SESSION WEEKLY / February 28, 1997 HIGHER EDUCATION\"The existing building . . . will become inadequate over time,\" Steinmann said, \"andan addition still wouldn't deal with all theproblems,\" which include a limited electri-cal and data distribution system, water pen-etration problems, and an unreliable powersystem. In addition, Steinmann said, pur-chasing and renovating the River Park Plazabuilding would not achieve any significantsavings. According to the SGS report, renovating the existing building would cost nearly $40million, plus somewhere between $22 mil-lion and $44 million to buy it. The consultants told the legislators that, as far as constructing a new building, theyhave essentially two options \u2014 the currentsite of the state's motor pool at 13th andRobert streets or the downtown St. Paulblock at East 11th and Wabasha streets. Ofthe two, Steinmann said, the motor pool siteis the most workable and the least expensive.A building at the downtown site would costnearly $97 million to construct, Steinmannsaid, while a similar structure at the motorpool lot would check in at a little more than$90 million. Of course, Steinmann said, the state could always opt to purchase the existing buildingand rehabilitate it, but he argued against thatmove. Not everybody, however, agrees with the SGS numbers. Jerry Toolien, who owns the JLT Group called Steinmann's report \"ineffective andirrelevant.\" The building, he said, could berenovated for half the amount the SGS Groupsaid would be necessary. \"There isn't anything wrong with that building,\" Toolien said, adding that thebuilding was appraised seven years ago andvalued at $47 million. JLT, Toolien said, would love to do busi- ness with the state, but no state official hasyet broached the subject. \"We know that the deal has to work for the state and the Minnesota taxpayers,\" Tooliensaid, but \"we just doesn't work.\" Snow removal costs The House passed a proposal Feb. 27 to mark $20 million to help cities and countiesrecoup some of their weather-related costs.The vote was 131-1. Sponsored by Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL- Little Falls), HF100 would authorize the com- missioner of public safety, the governor, andthe Legislature to appropriate grant moneyto cities, counties, and towns for recent se-vere weather-related matters. Most of the appropriations would be matched by federalemergency funds. The funds would be divided into three parts: $7 million to the disaster areas; $7million to all units of government to coverthis year's costs; and $6 million to handlespring floods. \"This was the worst winter in 50 years by some estimates; 100 years by others,\" saidRep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), whospoke in favor of the funding. Rep. MartySeifert (R-Marshall) said township budgetsin his district are overwhelmed by snow re-moval costs. \"It illustrates that the funding isdirely needed,\" Seifert said. Wenzel added that the money would be equitably distributed and said that moredamage occurred this winter than the statecould pay for. HF100 now moves to the Senate. U of M regents selected After initially generating considerable con- troversy over the selection process, the Min-nesota Legislature elected five new regents tothe University of Minnesota without debate.The vote was conducted in a joint session ofthe House and Senate on Feb. 27. The new regents are: First District: Bryan Neel, an incumbent regent and a doctor at Rochester's MayoClinic (169 votes) over Thomas Stoa, adoctor practicing in La Crosse, Wis., (25votes). University of Minnesota regent candidate Bryan Neel, First Congressional District, kept a vote tally asmembers of the House and Senate voted to elect the University of Minnesota Board of Regents Feb. 27.Neel was elected along with four others. Fourth District: David Metzen, superin- tendent of the South St. Paul schools (177votes) over Carol Erickson, superinten-dent of the Roseville School District (18votes). Fifth District: Michael O'Keefe, an incum- bent regent and executive vice president ofthe McKnight Foundation (194 votes). Noother candidates were nominated for thepost. Sixth District: Maureen Reed, a doctor and HealthPartners medical director for con-tracted care (194 votes) over Harry SiebenJr., a former House speaker (1 vote). Seventh District: Bob Bergland, a former secretary of agriculture (176 votes) overformer state representative Bob Anderson(19 votes), who was nominated on theHouse floor by Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls). The 12-member Board of Regents includes one person representing each of Minnesota'seight congressional districts and four at-large members, including one U of M stu-dent (who is enrolled at the time of election). Regents serve six-year terms that are stag- gered so that four seats come up for electionby the Legislature in each odd-numberedyear. Five seats were available this year be-cause of the October 1996 resignation ofRegent Jean Keffler. (Gov. Arne Carlson ap-pointed O'Keefe to temporarily fill Keffler'sseat). Ninety-one candidates applied for the open seats this year, and 23 of them wereinterviewed by the Regent Candidate Advi-sory Council, a panel created in 1988 toscreen candidates for the board. (See Feb. 7,1997, Session Weekly, page 10.)11 February 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYINDUSTRYINSURANCEINSURANCEInstructors and technology College students on some campuses don't have to worry if they miss a lecture; they canreview the material or consult with facultymembers via their own computer stations.They can also find material on topics andsubjects from sources around the world andgain access to leaders in a desired field ofstudy. Students can learn a foreign languageand even earn a degree through the elec-tronic media. Many schools use such services as a selling point to prospective students. Bemidji StateUniversity even uses multimedia to sell itscampus \u2014 a CD-ROM can now replace thepublication the school would normally sendto potential enrollees. Still, not everyone is sold on the benefits of the escalating use of technology for teachingstudents. The subject was discussed Feb. 24 by the House Education Committee's Higher Edu-cation Finance Division. Rep. Betty Folliard(DFL-Hopkins) said she has heard from col-lege instructors who fear that technologywill replace them. James Bensen, presidentof Bemidji State University, put those fearsto rest. \"On our campus, the opposite is so. We thought we might have 20 faculty membersopt to become involved in our electronicacademy. Instead, we have 60. There is somuch excitement because what they're see-ing is not only a chance to interact withstudents on campus, but students anywherein the world. It puts the faculty on the frontend of the curve,\" Bensen said. Marvin Marshak, vice president of Aca- demic Affairs at the University of Minne-sota, concurred. \"You can't have studentssitting by themselves at computers and learn-ing that way,\" he said. \"Technology relievesfaculty of the repetitive, lower-value parts ofteaching, and frees them to do the reallyimportant parts, which is to engage stu-dents, challenge them, help them questiontheir ideas, and learn how to analyze prob-lems.\" Further discussion on the issue is expected, particularly in light of Gov. Arne Carlson'sbudget recommendations that call for arecord number of dollars to be spent ontechnology in the schools. Saving for education A bill to help parents save for their children's college years was approved Feb.25 by the House Education Committee. HF130 would make affordable, tax-free bonds available from the state. Bill sponsorRep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal) said the aim of his proposal is to assist middle-in-come families who may not qualify for somefinancial aid programs but are hard-pressedto pay out-of-pocket for a child's collegeeducation. Under the bill, the Department of Finance would be required to make the general obli-gation bonds sold to finance state construc-tion projects available at a lower cost.Currently, the bonds are sold at a minimum$5,000 denomination. The bill calls for bondsas small as $500 to be made available. Anyone could buy the smaller bonds , but the bill includes provisions designed to en-courage their purchase for college savings. First, the bill stipulates that up to $25,000 in bonds would not count against a studentwhen determining eligibility for state grants.Second, the bill would allow employees touse a payroll deduction plan to purchase thebonds, thus decreasing the employee's tax-able income. (See Feb. 14, 1997, Session Weekly, page 7.) Carlson said his bill would set up a pro- gram, dubbed Gopher State Bonds, similarto ones already in place in 24 other states.The first state to try it was Illinois, Carlsonsaid, and the response there was very posi-tive. The bill drew bipartisan support in the Education Committee. \"It just makes an awful lot of sense,\" said Rep. Bob Ness (R-Dassel), who praised thesimplicity of the plan to allow parents to reapthe benefits of the ongoing practice of statebond sales. Carlson sponsored a similar bill in 1996, which passed the House but failed to winSenate approval. The bill now goes to the House Capital Investment Committee. Taconite help Minnesota's taconite producers face sub- stantial challenges in the coming years andneed $4 million from the Legislature to re-main competitive, industry representativestold the House Economic Development andInternational Trade Committee Feb. 26. HF409 , sponsored by Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey), would provide the industrywith $4 million from the state general fundto construct a new high tech processing fa-cility that produces taconite pellets contain-ing a much higher percentage of iron. Knownas Direct Reduction Iron (DRI), the pelletscontain 93 percent iron, compared to the 64percent found in the product now in pro- duction. \"This is . . . a critical first step in saving an industry that doesn't need saving today ortomorrow, but possibly 10 or 20 years downthe road,\" Solberg told the committee. The entire facility, said Minnesota Iron and Steel Company (MIS) Chair and ChiefExecutive Officer Robert Greer, would costmore than $650 million. The legislative dol-lars, he said, represent seed money to get theproject off the ground. The plant, wouldalmost assuredly be built by MIS. Other industry representatives told the committee that the Iron Range is in dangerof losing its place as a leader in the industry,which is why the Legislature must act now toprovide the funding. Other facilities, locatedfor the most part in foreign countries, areheavily subsidized by their governments andhave already moved to DRI, putting Minne-sota behind the competitive eight ball. Moreover, the technology will shift again, to producing steel directly from taconite ore,said Iron Range Resources and Rehabilita-tion Board Commissioner Jim Gustafson. \"The timing is very critical for the state of Minnesota,\" Gustafson said. \"The windowof opportunity is very narrow because every-body is going to be building these\" newproduction facilities. MIS, Solberg said, is working to line up private investors to finance the remainder ofthe project's cost, but the company maycome back to the state for more money some-time down the road. The committee approved HF409 and sent the bill to its Economic Development Fi-nance Division. Direct care for women A bill that would forbid health insurers from requiring women to obtain a referral tosee an obstetrician or a gynecologist passedthe House Feb. 24. The vote was 132-0. HF447 , sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown), would require thatinsurance companies and health mainte-nance organizations allow female enrolleesdirect access to obstetricians and gynecolo-gists. Under the bill, women would have to be allowed to schedule an appointment with anobstetrician or gynecologist without priorapproval from the insurer or a referral froma \"gatekeeper\" primary care physician.12 SESSION WEEKLY / February 28, 1997TAXES $TRANSPORTATION Direct access to an obstetrician or gyne- cologist would be required for annual ex-aminations, any subsequent treatmentdeemed necessary by the specialist, mater-nity care, and treatment of acute or emer-gency conditions. Companies would bebarred from charging women extra for di-rect access. (See Feb. 21, 1997, Session Weekly , page 7.) The bill now goes to the Senate. Senior tax break Senior citizens struggling to keep up with burgeoning taxes in the face of increasingproperty values could defer their paymentsunder three identical bills heard by the HouseTaxes Committee's Property Tax and TaxIncrement Finance Division Feb. 24. Many senior citizens on fixed or low in- comes, said Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown), who sponsored HF633 , are \"scared to death\" that they will be forced toleave their homes because they can't paytheir taxes. This legislation, she said, wouldprovide them one more option. The bills \u2014 HF230 , HF633 , and HF732 \u2014 would allow senior citizens with incomesof under $30,000 who are not delinquent inprevious assessments to put off property taxpayments that exceed 5 percent of theirhousehold income. The deferrals could notexceed three-quarters of the value of theirhome. The state would pay the tab and issuea lien, subject to a 5-percent interest rate,against the property for the deferred amount. The deferral would end, and the taxes would be due within 90 days, when the prop-erty is sold, when the owner dies or choosesto opt out of the program, or when theproperty no longer qualifies as a homestead.The bills are similar to a measure passed bythe House in both 1995 and 1996 that did notbecome law. \"This is not an answer, but an option for senior citizens if we're not going to do anyserious property tax reform,\" Murphy said.\"Rising property taxes should not be thedeciding factor if they're going to leave theirhome or not.\" The division referred HF230 to the full Taxes Committee.Tightening title transfers Car buyers who fail to promptly transfer the title on the vehicle would face new pen-alties, under a bill approved Feb. 26 by theHouse Transportation and Transit Com-mittee. Bill sponsor Rep. Ron Erhardt (R-Edina) said HF609 would help the state to \"squeeze down on those folks who are in violation\" ofstate law. Some car buyers do not transfer the title on a vehicle for a variety of reasons, Erhardtsaid. For example, the buyer may not want topay for insurance or may not have a driver'slicense. (State law requires proof of insur-ance and a valid driver's license to obtain atitle.) When a title is not transferred, problems can arise for car sellers, who may be heldliable for parking tickets or other infractionsthat occur after the vehicle has been sold. Currently, it is a misdemeanor for a buyer to fail to apply for a title transfer within 14days of acquiring a vehicle. The bill wouldgive buyers just 10 days to apply for a titletransfer and to pay the necessary fees. The Department of Public Safety would Turn up the volume A bill that would have allowed Minnesota police officers to ticket motorists who playtheir car stereos at a volume that \"unreason-ably disturbs the peace and quiet of a personnearby,\" failed on the House floor Feb. 27.The vote was 58-72. Under HF86 , sponsored by Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), a violation wouldoccur if sound from a radio, tape, or com-pact disc player is \"plainly audible\" at adistance of 100 feet or more from a vehicle.Violators would face a petty misdemeanorcharge, which carries a fine of up to $200. Stanek, a Minneapolis police officer, said he wanted a law that \"law enforcement coulduse to address quality-of-life issues.\" But many members had reservations. \"This bill could declare open season on kids,\" saidRep. David Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm).\"Anyone playing a stereo gives the police anopen invitation to stop them. This is ridicu-lous.\" Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount) saw otherwise. \"It's ridiculous how others ex-pand their own rights to stomp all over thepeace and quiet of others.\" The legislation would not have interfered with the right of municipalities to enact theirown noise abatement laws. Several cities,including Minneapolis and St. Paul, alreadyhave ordinances related to loud car stereos.Stanek's bill would have provided a state-wide standard for car stereo use. Despite the House vote, HF86 is not offi- cially dead. After the floor vote, lawmakersreconsidered the bill and referred it to theHouse Judiciary Committee for more work. Susan Downing, left, a St. Paul citizen concerned about education, talked with MaryMartin, a visiting scholar from the Universityof Minnesota's Center for Advance FeministStudy, during the Women Come to the Capitolevent Feb. 24. Martin collected pieces ofpoetry, prose, collage, drawings, and photosto make a collaborative art form called a Zine(a photocopied publication) to commemoratethe event.suspend the registration on the vehicle if thebuyer does not transfer the title within 10days of the sale, under the bill. If the vehicle registration is suspended, the buyer would have to pay an additional $5reinstatement fee along with the normal titletransfer charges. If, after 14 days, the buyerstill has not transferred the title, an addi-tional $2 charge will be applied. Also, law enforcement officers could im- pound a vehicle if the registration has beensuspended because the buyer failed to trans-fer the title. Erhardt sponsored a similar bill in 1995. The measure passed the House but stalled ina House-Senate conference committee. HF609 now goes to the House floor.13 February 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYDo you know?Among the first women to serve in the Minnesota House of Representatives wasa twentysomething \"flapper\" whose ide-alism and determination thwarted at-tempts to dismiss her. Dubbed by the press as the \"flapper legislator,\" Myrtle Cain, a women's laborunion activist from Minneapolis, drewnational attention by introducing legis-lation to combat the Ku Klux Klan, andshe led an early attempt to pass equalrights legislation. Historical documents are unclear about Cain's precise age when, in 1923, shejoined three other women in being thefirst females to enter the state House.Most records estimate she was bornaround the turn of century and was in herearly 20s when she came to the Capitol. Cain was raised in a working-class Min- neapolis household and worked for theTelephone Operators Union, where shewas a leader in its first strike in 1918. Shealso was active in the Women's TradeUnion League of Minneapolis and theNational Woman's Party. In the wake of the success of the women's suffrage movement, Cain feltcompelled to seek public office. A pro-union platform won her election in 1922 from a labor stronghold in Minneapolis. Cain's youth, good looks, and liberal ideas brought her the \"flapper legislator\"and \"working girl legislator\" tags and pro-vided grist for those clinging to the notionthat politics ought to be solely a man's game. However, her work in the Legislature demonstrated that she belonged. Cainauthored an anti-Ku Klux Klan mea-sure making it illegal to appear in publicwith a masked face. Fifteen states imi-tated Cain's idea. (The Minnesota lawwas altered in 1995 to allow concealedfaces for religious reasons and for pro-tection from weather.) After the 1923 session, Theodore Christianson, who served with Cain inthe Legislature and later became gover-nor, described Cain as \"a quiet and pains-taking worker who shunned thelimelight consistently.\" In 1924, Cain, along with the three other female incumbents and six femalenewcomers, sought election to theHouse. Eight of the women lost thatyear, including Cain, who fell to a maleopponent by a margin of 39 votes. Cain was never again elected to public office, but she returned to the Capitol in1973 to speak in favor of the Equal RightsAmendment, a national proposal simi-lar to the measure she sponsored on thestate level 50 years earlier. Photo courtesy Minnesota Historical SocietyVETERANS Gulf War bonuses The Minnesota Legislature has paid out bo- nuses to Minnesota veterans of every majorwar \"since the beginning of time,\" according toRep. Mike City). This ses-sion, Minnesota's Persian Gulf War veteranscame a step closer to receiving theirs. Osskopp and Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL- North St. Paul) are sponsoring a bill thatwould spend $17.3 million to pay bonuses to44,000 Minnesota Gulf War veterans. It wasapproved by both the House General Legis-lation, Veterans Affairs and Elections Com-mittee and the House GovernmentOperations Committee Feb. 24 and Feb. 25,respectively. Last November, voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment toallow the state to appropriate money to paythe bonuses. The bill, HF444 , outlines how to distribute the money. In addition to the $17.3 million, another $250,000 would be spent on the administra-tive costs of advertising the bonuses' avail-ability, the application process, and issuingthe checks.The bill would apportion bonuses at three levels. About 13,200 veterans who are eli-gible for the Southwest Asia Service Medal\u2014 essentially those who served within thewar zone \u2014 would each receive $600. An-other 30,500 veterans who were preparing tobe shipped overseas would receive $300 each.The families of nine Minnesota soldiers killedin the war would receive $2,000 each. The bonuses are identical to those paid to veterans of the Vietnam War with one ex-ception \u2014 families who lost a loved oneduring that war received $1,000. Only Minnesota veterans who served be- tween Aug. 2, 1990, and July 31, 1991, wouldbe eligible for the bonus money. Applica-tions would be accepted from Nov. 1, 1997,to June 30, 1999. The program would beadministered by the Minnesota Departmentof Veterans Affairs, which would make ap-plications available through local serviceorganizations, such as Veterans of ForeignWars and American Legion groups. Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls) sought assurance that the bonus money could notbe taken from homeless veterans to satisfyliens. The bill stipulates that the paymentsare tax-free and are not \"subject to garnish-ment, attachment, or levy of execution.\"Wejcman and several other committee members also questioned how to handlepayments to veterans in mental health, sub-stance abuse, or other treatment programs. Jeff Olson, deputy commissioner for the Department of Veterans Affairs, said thatfurther study is required to determine if thebonus money could be withheld until pro-gram completion. The timing of the bill's passage from the General Legislation, Veterans Affairs andElections Committee coincided with the six-year anniversary of the first day of Gulf Warground action, according to Rep. Bill Haas(R-Champlin). HF444 now moves to the House floor. NOTES Speaking in support of a bill requiring rural cities and counties to work with thestate on land-use planning, Glenn Dorfmanof the Minnesota Association of Realtorssaid, \"As a New York transplant to Minne-sota, I think anything we can do to get pas-sive-aggressive Minnesotans to talk to eachother should be supported.\" Myrtle Cain, among the first women to servein the Minnesota House of Representatives,was a twenty something \"flapper\" whointroduced legislation to combat the KuKlux Klan and led an early attempt to passequal rights legislation.14 SESSION WEEKLY / February 28, 1997A new state budget forecast predicting a surplus topping $2 billion has Gov. ArneCarlson calling for a one-time tax refundand legislative leaders offering ideas of theirown. At a Feb. 27 press conference, Carlson revealed the specifics of the latest state bud-get forecast, which all sides agree paints arosy picture of Minnesota's economicsituation. A forecast budget surplus last estimated in November 1996 to be $1.4 billion has grownto $2.3 billion on the strength of steadyeconomic growth and lower than expectedspending, according to the latest figures fromthe Department of Finance. (The forecastpredicts the balance in state coffers at theend of the 1998-99 biennium based on spend-ing and revenue estimates.) The governor is pitching a plan to devote $750 million to a tax refund program he sayswould return an average of $400 to eachtaxpayer. The minimum refund would be$50 and the maximum would be $900 for asingle filer or $1,800 for a couple filing jointly. \"Bear in mind, this is their money,\" Carlson said. \"This is their opportunity tocelebrate, and this day really is for them.\" Carlson also hopes to commit $250 mil- lion of surplus revenues to what he describedas \"modest, incremental\" property tax re-form targeting commercial, Carlson's proposal,Revised budget forecast . . . Governor wants tax refund for all Minnesotans However, House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center) and Senate Major-ity Leader Roger Moe (DFL-Erskine) bothvowed to seek a different brand of tax reformfrom what Carlson is proposing. \"We're definitely interested in tax relief for the citizens of Minnesota,\" Carruthers said.\"We want to focus on property tax relief.\" \". . .We believe that this is an opportunity \u2014 one that we haven't had for a long time \u2014\"It's wonderful growth, but we have to keep in mind that the economy is cyclical,\"he said. \"We should put resources aside todeal with that.\" House Republicans also have a plan of their own \u2014 one that is similar to thegovernor's. The House GOP plan calls for$1.3 billion of surplus revenues to be de-voted to taxpayer refunds, which would becapped at $1,500 for a family of three. \"It's the taxpayers' money, and they should get it back. It's that simple,\" said HouseMinority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon).\"If we don't give it back, the Legislature willspend it. \"Instead of debating whether we have a rebate, we should be debating the size of therebate.\" Despite the differences of opinion, Carlson said he is optimistic that consensus can bereached on major issues, such as reforms inthe property tax system and in education,during this legislative session. In fact, the governor is so optimistic he said there is \"no reason why we can't close[the session] earlier than expected.\" At the same time, Carlson vowed to op- pose legislative proposals that would requirenew, long-term spending commitments.Such spending, the governor said, couldthrust the state into a situation similar to\"the darkness of 1991,\" when he enteredoffice facing a $1.8 billion deficit. \u2014 Nick Healy\"We believe that this is an opportunity \u2014 one that we haven't had for a long time \u2014 to make some funda- mental property tax reform and relief and provide that to the citizens of Minnesota.\" \u2014House Speaker Phil Carruthers that $250 million would go toward propertytax relief in 1999 as the first piece of a three-year, $900 million property tax cut. The governor also hopes to use surplus revenues to fund initiatives in early child-hood development and education, includ-ing a proposed $150 million for tax creditsintended to help parents of school-age chil-dren to afford private school tuition or othereducational expenses such as tutoring. Leaders of DFL caucuses in both legisla- tive chambers also welcomed the news of thelatest economic forecast, and they echoedthe governor's call for tax reforms.to make some fundamental property tax re- form and relief and provide that to the citi-zens of Minnesota.\" Neither Carruthers nor Moe said they plan to support the governor's plan to send re-funds to taxpayers. \"We don't believe that a one-time check to people is the kind of reform that will bemeaningful,\" Moe said. Instead, he said, law-makers should pursue \"real property taxrelief\" that is not just \"a short-term fix.\" Moe also responded to the latest economic forecast with a call for caution among law-makers. House Republican Leader Steve Sviggum holds up a sample tax refund check for $1,000 at a pressconference Feb. 27. House Republicans are proposing to send $1.3 billion of the state budget surplus backto the taxpayer through income tax rebates.15 February 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYRep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) and Sen. Jerry Janezich (DFL-Chisholm) announced Feb. 24 that they will soon introduce legislation cre-ating a partnership between the stateand the Minnesota Twins to build a newoutdoor baseball stadium. Under thedeal, the state would assume 49 percentownership of the Twins. The new proposal alters a previous plan announced by Gov. Arne CarlsonJan. 8, and is the result of ongoing nego-tiations between the two legislators, thegovernor's Chief of Staff Morrie Ander-son, Metropolitan Sports Facilities Com-mission President Henry Savelkoul, andrepresentatives of the Pohlad family,which owns the Twins. The new plan removes the retractable roof from the stadium. Otherwise, thebuilding design remains much the same.Raising the roof lowers the total con-struction cost from around $350 millionto about $285 million, not counting landacquisition costs. \"The ballpark was de-signed to work with or without the roof,\"said Twins President Jerry Bell. \"With no roof, there will be lost rev- enues,\" Bell said. \"We're not giving up Stadium proposal raises roof, lowers public risk would have to repay. Many lawmakersregarded the wording as misleading. Bellsaid that calling the $82.5 million a \"con-tribution\" in the original plan was busi-ness lingo for \"financing\" and had beenmisinterpreted. \"It was a mistake,\" Bellsaid. If the state decides to add the roof later, the Pohlads would still make themillion and under the proposal would be paid for by a 10-cent-per-pack ciga-rette tax hike and by an unspecified tickettax. Local government, presumably Min- neapolis, would be responsible for pro-viding a site for the stadium and anadditional $3 million annual subsidy. In return for its $250 million, the state would get a 49-percent share of the Twinsoperation, and the team would sign a30-year lease on the stadium. The Twins'current estimated market value is $105million. An appraisal will be conductedto determine the team's true value. The Pohlads would be locked into the agreement through April 1, 2006. Atthat time, they could ask the state to buyout their share of the Twins. \"I would say there is substantially less risk to the public [in the new plan],\" saidAnderson. Acknowledging that the plan has few supporters in the Legislature, Rest said,\"We are committed to changing onemind at a time.\" \u2014 Steve Compton\"The retractable roof is something we can discuss later.\" \u2014Rep. Ann H. Rest on the roof, but we see that it's imprac-tical at this time to keep it in the pro-posal.\" \"The retractable roof is something we can discuss later,\" Rest said. Along with the roof, the Pohlads also are removing an $82.5 million loan fromthe table. Originally presented to law-makers and the public as a contribution,it was later revealed that the money wasintended to be a loan which the state$82.5 million loan available. This time, the Pohlads are offering a no-strings-attached $15 million dona-tion to the project. The Twins also relin-quish their claim on up to $25 million ofup-front project revenues from namingand concession rights. Unlike the previ-ous plan, the Pohlads would assume allresponsibility for operating losses. The state's portion of the construc- tion cost is estimated to be about $250Twins president Jerry Bell, left, watches as Twins stars past and present Harmon Killebrew, center, and Paul Monitor, right, unveil the model of a new Twins baseball stadium during a recent press conference at the Mall of America, the former site of Minnesota's last outdoor professionalballpark.16 SESSION WEEKLY / February 28, 1997According to public opinion, America is a seeth-ing mass of contradictions\u2014 politically, economi-cally, and socially \u2014 moreso now than ever, andpolicymakers would be wiseto understand that, aprominent pollster told agroup of legislators Feb. 25. \"Public opinion is a very important part of our country,\" said CharlesH. White, whom President Bill Clinton ap-pointed to the National Commission forEmployment Policy in August 1994. \"Inmany ways, it's more important now . . .because it's a good indicator of how theAmerican people feel about how things aregoing.\" White is the vice chair of Yankelovich and Partners, which provides research and con-sulting services to a variety of corporationsand government agencies. He has been anoutspoken advocate for the nonprofit sec-tor. White made his remarks at the Minne-sota History Center's 3M Auditorium, thethird speaker in the Capitol Forum Seriessponsored by Minnesota Technology, Inc.and the McKnight Foundation. The series isdesigned to present legislators with a moreexpansive view of the circumstances in whichthey make policy decisions. White opened his lecture by explaining what he called the \"complicated process\"that determines public opinion. He outlinedfour distinct phases through which an issuetravels before it registers on the societal con-sciousness: awareness, identification, forma-tion of attitudes, and behavior. This process, he said, extends to all aspectsCapitol Forum Series . . . Conflicting public opinion makes lawmaking tough In an effort to explain the seeming reversal of attitudes, White traced a brief social his-tory. He contrasted the relatively naive atti-tudes of the 1950s and early 1960s with thecynicism that emerged in the late 1960s andbloomed into dark flower with Watergateand the 1980s corporate, free-for-all frenzy. \"We came to a point at which it became clear that some of our policies caused highdivorce rates and increased drug use anddrop-out rates,\" White said. \"The wholemorality question became one for all of us.\" As a result, he said, people feel positively about the country, but not too deeply. Theywant big changes in education and a devolu-tion in government. They're down on bigbusiness, particularly corporate media mo-nopolies, yet they want more informationquicker \u2014 they just won't always use it. Theywant a better quality of life, but they're un-sure of how to measure it. All of these conclusions, White said, have implications for legislators, who must redefinethe role government plays in people's lives.Government, he said, does not bear all theresponsibility for the social ills and cannotshoulder all the burden of addressing them. Government can focus on the lopsided economy and welfare system, which Whitecalled the \"defining challenge of our time.\"It can also define goals and a means of mea-suring success; it can organize itself and thenonprofit sector more effectively to deal withproblems. \"Thousands are suffering,\" White said, \"but we haven't put together the govern-ment, the nonprofits, and the idea of indi-vidual responsibility.\" Indeed, White's comments rang true, sev- eral legislators said after the lecture, butnoted that White was not the first to presentthem. \"A lot of it is information we've had in the past,\" said Rep. Ted Winter (DFL-Fulda). \"Ithink the salient had is . . the value of govern-ment sold if there's not some way toshow it.\" And there's certainly no disputing the value of well-conducted public opinion polling,said Rep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview). \"He's talking about what public opinion is,\" Krinkie said. \"It's up to us, as publicofficials, to tie into that public perception, totry and understand, 'Why does someone feelthat way?' and to try and turn the tide.\" \u2014 F.J. Gallagher \"He's talking about what public opinion is. It's up to us, as public officials, to tie into that public perception, to try and understand, 'Why does someone feel that way?' and to try and turn the tide.\" \u2014Rep. Phil Krinkie of society \u2014 politics, business, nonprofits, ethics, and social issues \u2014 and, upon closerexamination, reveals that Americans haveexperienced a profound transformation sincethe 1950s. A nation that once believed what'sgood for General Motors is good for thecountry now views corporations as facelessentities driven relentlessly by the bottom line with no regard for the consequences oftheir actions. Similarly, many people believe they are bet- ter off now than their parents were at the sameage, but feel that their children won't be. Con-tradictions such as this abound, White said.Politicians should be careful not to dismiss publicopinion in the U.S. because no matter howcontradictory, \"it's a good indicator of how theAmerican people feel about how things are going,\"according to Charles H. White, vice chair ofYankelovich and Partners, which provides researchand consulting services to a variety of corporationsand government agencies. He spoke as part of theCapitol Forum Series Feb. 26.17 February 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY District 9B 1996 population: 34,572 Largest Location: northwestern Minnesota Top concern: \"I think we need to keep some of our school funding local, so that we cancontrol [the schools] locally. School boardsspend too much time on state mandates. Idon't think any state mandate should go outwithout the funding to back it up.\" \u2014Rep. Bob WestfallIt seems some Minnesota lawmakers were born political, reared in households whereopinions on current events were passed atthe dinner table along with the potatoes and green beans. Otherswere not, and talk offamily and farmingdominated meals. \"I grew up in a family that wasn't very politi-cal,\" said Rep. BobWestfall (R-Rothsay).His parents didn't dis-cuss politics at home and wouldn't tell their children who theyvoted for. \"They said that was a secret.\" But since 1962, when he attended his first precinct caucus, Westfall has not been shy inexpressing his opinions among the Republi-can faithful. At that first caucus, he waselected a delegate to the county convention.\"I don't think I've missed a caucus or con-vention since then,\" he said. Westfall's first run for public office led to a six-year stint on the Rothsay School Boardin the 1970s. Later, he served four years onthe board of the West Central EducationCooperative Service Unit (WCECSU) atFergus Falls. WCECSU is one of nine Educa-tion Cooperative Service Units in the statethat provide a range of shared educationalservices to schools. He was first exposed to the Legislature on lobbying trips to St. Paul for WCECSU in theearly 1980s. But he said those lobbying tripsNew members . . . For Westfall, fewer laws often can be a better solution didn't whet his appetite to become a law-maker. \"It just didn't appeal to me at thetime,\" Westfall said. He did, however, answer the Republican party's call to duty and challenged District 9Sen. Keith Langseth (DFL-Glyndon) in 1990. \"The party needed a candidate, and no- body else wanted to run,\" Westfall said. Helost by nearly 6,000 votes. Two years later, Westfall again was re- cruited, this time to challenge District 9BDFL incumbent Rep. Marvin Dauner. Helost by more than 2,500 votes. In a second shot at Dauner's seat in 1994, however, Westfall came within 543 votes ofwinning. The term would be Dauner's last.He announced that he would not run againin 1996. Westfall's persistence paid off in 1996 when he defeated the DFL-endorsed candidateJohn Young by 321 votes for the vacant seat. With his wife, Darlene, and his oldest son back home minding the family's crop andlivestock farm, Westfall is now devoting hisfull attention to representing his district'sconcerns at the Legislature. Along the NorthDakota border in the west central Minnesotadistrict, property taxes are a big issue. \"Property tax reform, everybody wants it,\" Westfall said. The solution is to hold theline on spending. \"Our mentality is thatsomeone else is going to pay for it. Peoplehave to realize that if we are going to spend,we [all] have got to pay for it.\" He is also hearing from retailers back homeRep. Bob Westfallwho are upset about Gov. Arne Carlson'sproposal to pay for a new stadium for theMinnesota Twins with a 10-cent tobacco taxincrease. \"They say they are already gettingtoo much competition from the Indian ca-sino.\" (Nearby Shooting Star Casino is ableto sell tobacco free from state taxes.) Westfall also campaigned on term limits for state officials and plans to introducepertinent legislation, although he admits itschances of passage are slim. While some have come to the Capitol with a detailed agenda, Westfall subscribes to thetheory that no government action can oftenbe a better solution. \"If there is a need, I'll definitely do the best I can,\" said the Republican farmer fromRothsay, Minn. \"But I didn't come [to theLegislature] with the idea of being the firstout of the chute with a bill.\" \u2014 Steve Compton Marquis Maggiefield, left, and Ho Nguyen, fifthgraders at Anderson OpenSchool in Minneapolis,testified before the K-12Education FinanceDivision of the EducationCommittee Feb. 26 insupport of a bill thatwould expand a pilotbreakfast programestablished in 1994. 18 SESSION WEEKLY / February 28, 1997 It's no coincidence that the office of Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) belonged tohis predecessor, fellow DFLer and District64B Rep. Howard Orenstein. \"I asked for it. I felt it would be good karma,\"Paymar said. That's be-cause Orenstein adecade of service. \"If,after I've served in of- fice, people talk about me the way I heardthem talk about Howard, I'll be very happy.\" While the Capitol hallways are new to Paymar, he is no stranger to elective politics.He served eight years as a member of Duluth'scity council, including a term as president,which gives him a fairly good handle on thelegislative process, he said. Still, he's struckby the difference in mass between state andcity governing bodies. \"In Duluth, I was one of nine members. Now I'm one of 134, plus the Senate and allthe departments and commissions. The stateis huge. It's an awesome responsibility.\" Having grown up in the Duluth area and living now in St. Paul, Paymar said he has abroad perspective on state policy issues. Hisfamily background has made him sensitiveto even larger themes. \"My mother did a lot to help me see the impact of racism and discrimination. Shewas very angry about racism, and thatstrongly influenced who I am. It made medetermined to do my part to stop injustice,\"he said. Part of his mother's perspective came fromNew members . . . Paymar brings urban voice to help all Minnesotans losing family members to the Holocaust. \"Iwas born eight years after [World War II]ended. I was indoctrinated on the Holo-caust,\" Paymar said. It led to civic activismand the peace and civil rights movementswhile still in his teens, starting with a memo-rial march after the assassination of Dr.Martin Luther King, Jr. Neighborhood ac-tivism and work on environmental causeswould follow. Paymar moved to St. Paul in 1989 when his wife, Susan Askelin, took a job in DakotaCounty. Their children, Jason, 28, and Nicole,22, also live and work in the Twin Cities.Paymar said the peace and stability of theHighland Park and Macalester-Grovelandneighborhoods that he represents do notinsulate him from concern about the city'soverall health. From his seat on the JudiciaryCommittee, Paymar is in a position to help. \"I have a 15-year history in working against domestic violence. I hope to influence theway we approach crime prevention. It's acritical issue in St. Paul,\" Paymar said. Paymar has written two books: Violent No More: Helping Men End Domestic Abuse, a self-help book for violent and abusive menwho want to change their behavior; and Edu- cation Groups for Men Who Batter: The DuluthModel, an academic book for practitioners who work with men who are violent. Themodel is being used by over 300 programsthroughout the country, Paymar said. Property tax reform is another of his other priorities. \"One thing I heard over and over during the campaign is frustration that reform getsdiscussed, argued over, and debated, butnothing ever happens.\" He worries that theheavy tax burden will drive people from St.Paul and into the suburbs, only worsening urban sprawl \u2014 another issue of concern tohim. He said the property tax code should besimplified so that people can better judgewhether it's fair. He also believes that there iswidespread, bipartisan support for the stateto assume a greater portion of public educa-tion funding, which would reduce theamount that comes from property taxes. Paymar said he'd fight urban sprawl by strengthening the authority of the Metro-politan Council and having its members beelected, rather than appointed. Addressingurban concerns \u2014 across party lines \u2014 canbenefit all Minnesotans, he said. \"This is a pivotal time for the metro area, in which we have to address the social prob-lems creeping into the entire state. There willbe less rancor and political bickering be-tween the parties, and more cooperation thissession. All of us need to be sympathetic tothe needs of legislators throughout the state.\" \u2014 Celeste Riley District 64B 1996 population: 32,468 Largest County: Ramsey Location: inner city Top concern: \"All neighborhoods need to work together for stronger community. It'simportant to expand the tax base, increasethe quality of the schools, assure safe streets,and provide opportunities for our children.I'm going to do what I can to assure that thestate is furthering those goals.\" \u2014Rep.

For Minnesota legislators, Groundhog Day is not oneof them. Even if the woodchuck did not see its shadow on Feb. 2, spring does notcome to the Capitol for members and staff until well after March 26, the firstdeadline for bills to be out of committee and on their way to the floor for opendebate. But February was observed as a celebration of Black History Month and March is devoted to Women's History Month. In honor of women's history, you will findsome updated information on page 28 of this issue of Session Weekly . Much of the index pertains to Minnesota women elected to the Legislature, including the firstfour elected in 1922. Likewise, a tribute is paid here to a small group who were, or are presently part of a racial minority in the Legislature. The first to be elected was J. Francis Wheatonin 1898. Much of his district included Bloomington, Edina, and Richfield. Heserved for one term. No other person of color was elected for 74 years until B. Robert Lewis became the first black senator in 1972 from St. Louis Park. Lewis died in office in 1978. Alsoin 1972, Ray O. Pleasant was elected to the House from the suburb of Bloomington.He served until 1982. Others included Conrad Vega, a Latino from South St. Paul, elected to the Senate in 1976, and Frank Rodriguez Sr., to the House in 1979, from St. Paul's Mexican-American community. Randy Staten was elected in1981. For three terms, herepresented Minneapolis' near north side. The total population of members ofcolor dropped to one in 1986, when Richard Jefferson took the seat left open byStaten. The election year of 1990 brought in three new legislators and raised the minority caucus to four. Harold \"Skip\" Finn, the first Native American in the Legislaturefrom Cass Lake served for two terms in the Senate. Across the way, the Housecelebrated the arrival of Edwina Garcia, representing Richfield, and Carlos Mariani,whose district encompasses downtown and the west side of St. Paul. Garcia and Mariani continue to serve along with Jefferson, and first-term representative Satveer Chaudhary, an East Asian-American from Columbia Heights.With 39 women now in the House and four legislators of color, one of them recentlynoted that \"It may not seem like the opportunity is there for everyone, but thepromise of a truly democratic society definitely is.\" \u2014LeClair G. Lambert3 March 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . Feb. 27 - March 6, 1997 Highlights Owners of low-income housing, older apartment buildings, and commercial-industrial properties would see a cut in their propertytaxes under bills approved by the House Taxes Committee's Prop- erty Tax and Tax Increment Finance Division March 5. HF627 , sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), would reduce property tax rates for low-income housing by creating a new assessmentProperty tax reform . . .

Other low-income prop-erties that don't qualify for the new classifi-cation, primarily residential, non-homesteadbuildings containing up to three units andnon-subsidized apartments with four ormore units, would also get a tax break phasedin over three years beginning in 1998. By2000, the non-homestead buildings wouldbe taxed at 2 percent and the non-subsidizedcomplexes at 2.8 percent. Currently, thoserates stand at 2.3 percent and 3.4 percent,respectively. The bill also extends homestead status to some low-income housing, imposes rent restrictions onlandlords seeking to qualify for the new, lowerrates, and sets the percentage of rent that mayconstitute property tax at 20 percent. Under HF627 , more than $14 million in property tax revenue would be lost duringthe coming 1998-1999 biennium and nearly$60 million over the 2000-2001 period, ac-cording to a Department of Revenue analy-sis. To offset a potential tax loss to localcommunities, the bill contains a provisionfor increased Homestead and AgricultureCredit Aid (HACA). Low-income housing is now subject to a \"tremendously complex\" property tax struc-ture, Rest said. HF627 \"brings uniformity and consistency to that property tax type.\"Moreover, she continued, the bill would helppreserve Minnesota's dwindling stock of af-fordable housing. On the other hand, Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) felt HF627 did not go far enough in that direction, particularly withrespect to federal programs already in place.He introduced a series of amendments thatwould have required a percentage of theunits receiving the tax break to be occupiedby Section 8 renters. Section 8 is the federalsubsidy to low-income tenants.\"This is a good bill,\" Dawkins said, \"but it misses on one issue. It still allows propertiesthat don't qualify for Section 8 to receive thetax break.\" The percentage of landlords who accept the federal subsidy is already startlingly lowand HF627 would do nothing to change that, Dawkins argued. Indeed, it would dis-courage more landlords from participatingin the Section 8 program by rewarding themwith a lower property tax, he said. Ultimately, the division rejected the idea of tying a specific number of units to the Section 8 program and Dawkins had to settlefor an amendment merely requiring theMinnesota Housing Finance Agency(MHFA) to monitor changes in the numberof landlords accepting Section 8. HF744 , sponsored by Rep. Edwina Garcia (DFL-Richfield), also seeks to protectaffordable housing. The bill provides a mechanism similar totax increment financing for qualifying prop- erty owners. HF744 would exclude the value of improvements to a property from assess-ment for a five-year period, then phase in theincrease over a subsequent five-year term.To qualify, a property must be a residentialapartment building with four or more units,at least 30 years old, certified as \"affordable\"by the MHFA, and located in the seven-county metro area. Several other caveats alsoapply. Richfield City Manager Jim Proctor said the bill would help his community maintainits stock of affordable rental housing byencouraging the owners of aging buildingsto reinvest in their property. While the bill would provide some incen- tive to keep apartment buildings in goodrepair, a Department of Revenue represen-tative said, it could have some unintended consequences for landlords if they confused routine maintenance with actual, substan-tive improvements. \"If you have an apartment complex and you're putting in a swimming pool \u2014 that'san improvement,\" said MichaelWandmacher, director of the revenuedepartment's property tax department. \"Ifthey're changing the carpeting, that's main-tenance.\" A bill (HF627) that would significantly lower the property tax rate on aging apartments and low-incomehousing won approval from the Property Tax and Tax Increment Finance Division March 5.4 SESSION WEEKLY / March 7, 1997 AGRICULTUREHF6 , sponsored by Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) would reduce the prop-erty tax burden on commercial-industrialproperty by slashing the rate at which thefirst $100,000 of value is taxed. Under current law, the first $100,000 of regular commercial properties is subject to a3-percent property tax, while similar parcelslocated in enterprise zones are taxed at 2.3percent on the first $50,000 and 3.6 percentfor the next $50,000. Wenzel's bill wouldeffectively do away with the enterprise-zonedistinction and tax both classes at1.5 percent. All three measures move to the full Taxes Committee for consideration in the 1997omnibus tax bill. \u2014 F.J. Gallagher Feedlot problems Lawmakers heard warnings of environ- ment peril and assurances of good steward-ship during a hearing on the impact of hogfeedlots. The House Agriculture Committee and the House Environment and Natural Re-sources Committee conducted joint hear-ings on the controversial issue Feb. 24 andFeb. 28. Officials from agricultural organizations said Minnesota does not face the kind offeedlot problems occurring in other states, but environmental leaders said odor prob-lems and threats to ground and surface wa-ter demand tighter regulatory oversight. \"The smell robs us of our quality of life,\" said Monica Kahout, a Renville Countyfarmer and member of the Land Steward-ship Project. \"When the neighborhood hasto plan their day around wind direction,something is wrong.\" A feedlot is any building or lot where animals are confined and manure can accu-mulate, including manure lagoons used tostore waste. There are an estimated 45,000feedlots in Minnesota. Gov. Arne Carlson's proposed budget calls for $580,000 to be committed to feedlotodor and waste research during the 1998-99biennium, and several legislative proposalsrelated to feedlots are expected to be debatedthis session. Kahout and her family raise hogs on their farm, and like many in rural communities,they trace the problems with feedlots to theadvent of large, so-called corporate farms. In Renville County, large hog operations and the problems that sometimes accom-pany them began to appear in the early 1990s.The large hog farms, with manure lagoonscovering as much as 10 acres, are a nuisanceand a health threat, according to Kahout. \"Stewardship and family farms have al- ways tried to go hand in hand,\" she said. \"Wehave had livestock on our farm for almost 20years, and neighbors have not found oursetup offensive.\" Kahout urged lawmakers to support im- provements in state feedlot regulations, tosee that they are consistently enforced, andto allow local government units the author-ity to enact tougher requirements.However, an official from the Minnesota Pork Producers Association said the state'sexisting corporate farming laws and envi-ronmental standards have prevented serioushazards. \"Farmers are not in it for a quick buck. They're in it for the long haul,\" said DavidPreisler, executive director of the organiza-tion. \"If we do damage the environment,then we're not going to be in business forvery long.\" Minnesota's current feedlot regulations are already far ahead of other states whereserious problems have arisen, according toPreisler. The lack of such laws allowed cor-porate hog operations to develop unfetteredin places such as North Carolina, where leak-ing lagoons have fouled rivers and lakes. \"Those types of producers have absolutely no place in the future of our industry,\"Preisler said. Dwight Hasselquist, vice president of the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, urgedlawmakers to avoid regulatory changes thatwould hurt financially strapped familyfarmers. \"As regulations increase, the costs of meet- ing those regulations increase,\" Hasselquistsaid. \"It becomes more and more difficultfor the small operator.\" The problem with current state oversight of manure lagoons is that it focuses on de-sign of the facilities and does not pay enoughattention to their construction and opera-tion, said Marie Zellar, organizing directorfor Clean Water Action Alliance. \"We don't have the regulation to protect the environment, and we don't have theregulation to protect public health,\" Zellarsaid. Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls), who chairs the Agriculture Committee, said thefeedlot issue is of vital interest to the state'sagricultural industry. \"We can have in Minnesota a strong agri- culture economy and simultaneously pro-tect the environment,\" Wenzel said. Farm in the family The House Agriculture Committee ap- proved a bill March 3 that would providecontinued funding for a program that aimsto keep farms in the family. HF463 , sponsored by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls), would provide $200,000to the Passing on the Farm Center at South-west Technical College in Granite Falls, Minn. The funds would keep alive a program that assists families and others who are in theRobert Feuling, a small-business owner in LittleFalls, Minn., testified March 5 before the PropertyTax and Tax Increment Finance Division in favorof a bill (HF6) that would reduce the tax rate oncommercial-industrial property. Julie Jansen of Renville County told a Feb. 28 joint hearing of the Agriculture and Environment andNatural Resource committees about the problemsshe and her family have suffered living near a liquidmanure pond.5 March 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYprocess of transferring a farm from one gen- eration to the next. In 1995, the Legislature passed a law to create the Passing on the Farm Center byexpanding an existing local program into astatewide effort. But Gov. Arne Carlson line-item vetoed the $100,000 appropriation forthe center. Lawmakers passed a separate piece of leg- islation in 1996 providing $50,000 for op-eration of the center during fiscal year 1997,and the governor signed the bill. Prior to 1996, the project operated on grant funding from the Southwestern Min-nesota Initiative Fund, Sisters of Notre Dame,and several other organizations and was lim-ited to southwestern Minnesota. The program has an annual operating budget of about $125,000. Under Kubly'sbill, the state would provide $75,000 in fiscalyear 1998, with the other $50,000 comingfrom outside grants, and the state wouldpick up the full tab of $125,000 in fiscal year1999. Between 200 and 300 families have re- ceived some kind of assistance through theprogram since it came under the state'sumbrella July 1, 1996, according to IvanAnderson, program manager for the Passingon the Farm Center. The bill now moves to the House Environ- ment and Natural Resources FinanceCommittee. Poor milk pricing The House Agriculture Committee ap- proved a resolution March 3 asking the fed-eral government to provide relief forMinnesota dairy farmers currently feeling afinancial squeeze. HF1067 , sponsored by Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls), would require the state tosend a resolution to Congress, the president,and the Department of Agriculture askingfor changes in the federal milk pricingsystem. Minnesota dairy farmers in recent months have seen a significant drop in the prices theyget for their products, while the state's con-sumers continue to pay exceptionally highretail prices for milk. Low prices paid to farmers are driving them out of the dairy business, according toWenzel. The state is losing an average ofabout three dairy operations a day. \"It is not inconceivable to have this indus- try disappear from Minnesota,\" Wenzel, whochairs the Agriculture Committee, said. Cur-rently, the dairy industry generates $3.5 bil-lion in annual gross revenues in the state andprovides employment for about 39,000 people. The proposed resolution calls for an end to a pricing system that is, according to theresolution, \"profoundly unfair and discrimi-natory against Minnesota and Upper Mid-west dairy producers.\" It also requests that Minnesota and neigh- boring states be allowed to form a compactto guarantee dairy farmers a fair minimumprice if a similar compact already formed bynortheastern states is allowed to stand. HF1067 now moves to the House floor. CHILDREN Special-needs adoptions A bill to better reimburse licensed private adoption agencies who help place children,often from abusive homes, with new adop-tive families is on its way to the governor. The bill, which would reimburse agencies up to $16,000 per child, passed the HouseMarch 5 on a vote of 129-0. It passed theSenate Feb. 24 on a vote of 62-0. Currently, the Minnesota Department of Human Services reimburses licensed privateadoption agencies a maximum of $4,000 percase and the cap hasn't increased since the1980s. Today, it costs agencies from $8,000to $13,000 to place a single child with specialneeds, according to Bob DeNardo, a super-visor in the department's family and chil-dren services division. The current $4,000 cap discourages pri- vate agencies, especially the small ones, fromactively seeking families for special needskids because they cannot recoup their costs,said Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud) whosponsored the bill ( HF374/SF274* ) in the House. The adoption reimbursement helps com- pensate the private agency for recruitingfamilies, matching them with the right spe-cial needs child, and preparing the family forthe child through education, counseling, andhome visits. Special needs children are part of the Adop- tion Assistance Program, and in many cases,have been severely neglected or abused andtheir parents have relinquished their paren-tal rights to the state. The child may not onlysuffer from physical problems but from be-havioral, mental, and emotional ones as well. These children often wait in foster care until someone wants them, DeNardo hassaid. Currently, there are 1,700 children who are considered wards of the state. Some arebeing considered by families for adoption but nothing has been finalized. As of Janu-ary, however, no one has shown an interestin 813 of those children. Last year, more money was set aside for reimbursement for private adoption agen-cies, but steps to remove the cap have beentied up by a departmental rulemaking pro-cedure. The longer state officials wait tomake the change, the greater the risk thatfewer children with special needs will beplaced. The bill is designed to speed thingsup. (See Feb. 14, 1997, Session Weekly, page 4 and Feb. 21, 1997, Session Weekly, page 5.) Child support update The House Judiciary Committee's Civil and Family Law Division March 5 discusseda bill to revise the state's child support laws. Many of the provisions of HF925 \u2014 which was not voted on \u2014 are mandates of theFederal Welfare Reform Act, which is de-signed, in part, to reduce the number offamilies on welfare who are owed supportpayments, and to step up enforcement onthose who owe them. \"The underlying message is that parents are responsible for the support of their chil-dren,\" said Laura Kadwell of the MinnesotaDepartment of Human Services (DHS).\"There is no longer guaranteed cash assis-tance in this country. Child support is theone that is left and is being asked to pick upthe slack. People are coming to the county,the state, and the Legislature and saying, 'Ineed child support. How do I get it?'\" The intent is to draft the federal require- ments \"as conservatively as possible to avoidmisgivings about how far we're going\" re-garding changing current law, Kadwell said.The changes will become part of an omnibuschild support bill later this session, said Rep.Andy Dawkins, (DFL-St. Paul), committeechair. Christa Anders of the DHS said that the federal provisions coincide with the direc-tion in which Minnesota law was headingand that none are radical departures fromMinnesota child support policy. The federal mandates and the bill cover almost every aspect of child support law.Some areas the committee discussed are:provisions for keeping financial data on par-ents who owe support payments; sanctionson employers who fail to report relevantinformation about those who are to providesupport payments; and mandatory commu-nity service for an unemployed parent with achild or children on welfare.6 SESSION WEEKLY / March 7, 1997 The bill also includes details for reinstat- ing the \"most wanted\" list of parents who aredelinquent in their payments. The new listwould be restricted to those who owe themost money and those whom the state can-not find. Its primary function would be tohelp locate those parents, Kadwell said. Some provisions are unbalanced, accord- ing to Timothy Theisen, who testified onbehalf of R-KIDS, an advocacy group fornon-custodial parents. Theisen said thoserequiring blood tests to prove paternity aretoo broad and do not reflect the rights ofthose ordered to undergo them. The provi-sions of HF925 also fall short regarding a parent's rights in areas such as revokingdriver's licenses for failure to pay; rules gov-erning banks when they keep a debtor's fi-nancial records, and the criteria fordetermining a non-custodial parent's in-come, he said. Christina Huson, a St. Paul attorney with experience in child support cases, said thatsome of the new rules fail to take into ac-count the realities of trying child supportcases and enforcing support provisions. Shewrote a list of items that Dawkins said thecommittee will review. Dawkins said the committee will make further modifications to the child supportbill before passing HF925 on to the full Judi- ciary Committee. Later, the committee will address visita- tion rights. \"At issue is how do we enforcevisitation orders with the same vigor we dosupport obligations.\" he said. It takes a steady hand He had two minutes and 30 seconds to complete the job. It would be close, but Rep.Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City) thought hecould do it. Working the levers from his perch up in the crane's cab, Osskopp tried his best tograb a brick with the machine's shiny silverclaw. After several attempts, he finally snaredone and began to move his prize over to thehopper which would dump the brick on aconveyor belt, down a chute, and into a bin.He had less than one minute left until themechanical hand automatically released itsgrip. The hopper, only five feet above the pileof rock, might have been a mile away. \"I'm no good at these,\" Osskopp said as the load began to swing wildly on the cable.\"I can never win at these things.\" Hoping against hope, Osskopp let the brick go, but the load was moving too fast. Itclanged against the side of the hopper andtumbled back down into the pile, to be pickedup another day by some young visitor to the World Works Display at the MinnesotaChildren's Museum in St. Paul. Osskopp, along with a handful of the other members of the House Governmental Op-erations Committee's State Government Fi-nance Division, visited the museum March 3at the invitation of Ann Bitter, museum presi-dent. The committee recommends theamount of the museum's budget, and Gov.Arne Carlson's 1998-99 biennial request con-tains a $270,000 initiative for the institution,which Bitter said would allow the museumto expand on its mission to improve learningreadiness in the state's children. Before legislators toured the museum, Bit- ter outlined several of their learning readi-ness efforts, including one called \"BedtimeBook Reading.\" The program takes place inthe early evening hours, just before mostchildren's bedtime. Kids in their pajamas,accompanied by their parents, can come tothe museum, Bitter said, to hear books readby celebrity readers. \"We can't teach them how to read,\" Bitter said, \"but we can make them want to read.\" With that, the legislators were off to see the displays, including Habitot, which Bitterdescribed as one of the few galleries in theworld set up for children between the ages of6 and 48 months; and One World, an exhibitthat teaches the value of respect and coop-eration by recreating public areas where chil-dren might encounter people of differentethnic backgrounds. Debate on the museum's budget will oc- cur when the division's omnibus fundingbill is assembled.Rep. Mike Osskopp made a strong impression on a wall of pins during the State Government FinanceDivision's March 3 tour of the Minnesota Children's Museum in St. Paul. CRIME Battles on the drug front Two bills approved by the House Judi- ciary Committee would give law enforce-ment officers additional tools to fight illegaldrug use and sales. Adopted March 5, bothwill be added to the omnibus crime bill to bevoted on later this session. HF97 would address a method that drug pushers now use to circumvent the law. Cur-rent law treats possession of small quantitiesof drugs as a lesser offense than largeramounts. As a result, some drug dealers havelearned to carry only small amounts withthem for sale on the streets, according toMinneapolis Police Chief Robert Olson. \"Ourpolice officers are faced night after nightwith arresting the same faces,\" Olson said.\"Every time we develop an investigative tech-nique to stop them, they find a way aroundit.\" With a change in the law, the criminalswill find that \"those small amounts havesuddenly become large,\" he said. That's because the bill allows the amounts of drugs discovered in each arrest to stackover time, eventually resulting in a moreserious offense. \"Sales or acts of possessionby the . aggregated,\" the bill reads. Initially, the bill's sponsor and committee chair Rep. Wes Skoglund, (DFL-Mpls) hadasked for a 90-day period. The typical of-fender, he said, \"isn't hard to find,\" and ispicked up several times during that period.But Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), aMinneapolis police officer, suggested thatthe 90-day period was too limiting and suc-cessfully offered the 180-day amendment.7 March 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Steve Cramer from the Project for Pride in Living, said that the small dealers under-mine the fabric of neighborhoods. The \"re-volving door\" of repeat offenders is the mostdispiriting factor for neighborhoods tryingto maintain peace and stability. \"We're try-ing to build a quality of life that once ex-isted,\" he said. \"We have to disrupt thispattern of commerce that is making life mis-erable\" for law-abiding neighbors and busi-nesses, he said. The committee also approved HF96 , which adds several drugs to the list of Schedule IIcontrolled substances. Methcathinone and cathinone are pre- scription drugs that increasingly are beingstolen during robberies and are being manu-factured for illegal use. Schedule II drugs arethose with a high potential for abuse; haveaccepted medical uses; and may lead to se-vere psychological or physical dependence.Opiates and amphetamines are also on thelist. Making them Schedule II drugs willmake current criminal laws apply to theirpossession and sale. \"There are new drugs out there that aren't being grown,\" Skoglund explained. \"Instead,they're made of chemicals that people arebuying in quantity and mixing. The behav-ior of those who take them is terrible.\" Theuse of the drugs is spreading beyond theinner city, he added. \"These are very potent drugs,\" said tive John Lageson \"In some circles it's called'bathtub speed' because it's so easy to makeand to buy the ingredients. They're moreaddictive than methamphetamines.\" Fighting gangs statewide A proposal six months in the making to target criminal gang activity had its firstcommittee hearing March 3. HF163 would form a commission of the top law enforcement officials from acrossthe state that would develop a strategy andestablish a strike force to fight the growingproblem of gang crime. The measure wasdiscussed \u2014 but not voted on \u2014 during acrowded meeting of the House JudiciaryCommittee. Gang crime is not only exploding within the Twin Cities metro area, but is increas-ingly felt in smaller towns and rural commu-nities throughout Minnesota, according toHennepin County Sheriff Pat McGowan. Acoordinated effort is needed because gangand criminal activity do not honor city orcounty boundaries, he added. \"If we don'tlet gangs in Minnesota know that we meanLeft to right: Nick O'Hara, superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension; Patrick McGowan, Hennepin County sheriff; and Bob Fletcher, Ramsey County sheriff, testified before the House JudiciaryCommittee March 3 in favor of a bill (HF163) to establish a criminal gang council and strike force. business, we will have failed,\" he said. \"No areas are immune to the juvenile delinquency evolution to gangs,\" saidRamsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher. The bill specifies that those serving on the commission would be: the commissioner of public safety; the superintendent of the of Criminal Apprehension; the attor-ney general; Hennepin, Olmsted, Ramsey,and St. Louis county attorneys and sheriffs; and chief law enforcement officers for Min-neapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth \"This is the most significant gang-fighting measure this Legislature has ever taken,\"said Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), thebill's sponsor. \"Every gang member in thestate will be targeted.\" Dennis Flaherty, executive director of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Asso-ciation, praised the measure because it coor-dinates resources on a statewide basis inaddition to enabling local law enforcementagencies to focus personnel on localproblems. According to Minnesota Attorney Gen- eral Hubert Humphrey III, the national ho-micide rate for juveniles age 14-17 hasjumped 163 percent in 10 years, mostly dueto criminal gang activity. \"Kids are beingrobbed of their youth, their sense of safety,and, too often, their lives,\" he said. \"Thisprovides an opportunity for law enforce-ment agencies to come together in a com-prehensive plan to target and combat gangactivity.\" \"America has the most violent children in the world,\" Fletcher said. \"They're three timesworse than any other industrialized country.But their behavior can be modified by astrong law-enforcement response. . . . Weknow who the bad guys are. We just don'thave the resources to focus on them,\" headded. The bill authorizes the council to awardgrants for additional officers and other per- sonnel and equipment. Skoglund estimatedthat up to 40 new officers would be hired. Nospecific appropriation has been established. Continued discussion of HF163 is expected. EDUCATIONSCHOOL No-pass, no-drive A proposal to link driving privileges to academic performance has drawn criticismfrom high school students who say the planwould do nothing to improve learning orreduce dropout rates. \"Why should you punish students who have been putting forth the effort, but they just can't pass the test?\" asked Terrance Clark,a senior at Minneapolis South High School.\"This will be another strike against studentswho are striving hard to graduate.\" Clark was one of several teenagers who urged the House Education Committee toreject the \"no-pass, no-drive\" proposal dur-ing a March 4 hearing on the matter. The committee took no action on the bill, but the subject is expected to be taken upagain soon. HF446 , sponsored Rep. Len Biernat (DFL- Mpls), would prohibit the state from issuinga driver's license to anyone younger than 18who has not passed the state's basic skillsgraduation tests and who is not regularlyattending school. Biernat said the bill would provide addi- tional motivation for students by tappinginto the enthusiasm most young people havefor getting a driver's license. But the bill drew opposition from stu- dents, parents, teachers unions, and schoolofficials. \"The parents should decide if a kid is ready to drive,\" said Beau Brown, a youth8 SESSION WEEKLY / March 7, 1997 worker at North View Junior High School in Brooklyn Park. \"I think the state has gotteninvolved in too many things that are paren-tal decisions.\" Math and reading tests, required under Minnesota's graduation rule, are first givento students in the eighth grade, when moststudents are 14 years old. Students who failthe tests are given another chance to pass atleast once each school year. Exceptions to the academic requirements could be made for special-needs students,under the bill. Private school students wouldsimply have to provide evidence that theyare enrolled and making progress in school. Students who are dismissed (suspended or expelled) from school for more than fivedays would have their licenses suspended for30 days for a first-time dismissal and 90 daysfor each subsequent dismissal. Dropouts and habitual truants would have their licenses suspended by the Departmentof Public Safety until they turn 18. Shania James, a junior at Edison High School in Minneapolis, told the committeethat the bill would not prevent strugglingstudents from dropping out. \"They're just going to wait until they are 18 to get their driver's license or they'll justdrive anyway,\" James said. Bill supporters have touted the proposal as a part of an effort, which includes the basicskills tests and a move toward new statewideShanina James, a junior at Edison High School inMinneapolis, gave the thumb's down on a bill(HF446) that would prohibit the issuance of adriver's license to students under the age of 18 whohave failed pass the state's high school graduationtests. She testified March 4 before the HouseEducation Committee.testing efforts, to increase accountability inpublic education. Some students who testified during the hearing agreed that Biernat's bill would en-courage students to focus on school. \"If you can't concentrate in school you're not going to be able to concentrate whenyou're on the road,\" said Autumn Nomeland,a 15-year-old ninth grader at Menlo ParkAlternative School in Minneapolis who re-cently received her learner's permit. Unlicensed teachers? An education subcommittee March 6 re- jected a proposal to allow districts to hirenonlicensed teachers without approval fromthe State Board of Teaching. \"There are some things that local school districts can do better, but this is not one ofthem,\" said Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), a member of the House Educa-tion Committee's Subcommittee on Qualityinitiatives. The panel threw a roadblock in front of HF557 , a bill sponsored by Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield) and backed by Gov. ArneCarlson and the Department of Children,Families and Learning. The bill, which would alter current law allowing nonlicensed community experts toteach in public schools, is part of a push forlocal control and increased accountability,Tuma said. It is not an assault on licensedteachers or teachers unions. \"There is no bogeyman in the closet,\" Tuma said. \". . . This is a community deci-sion, and community safeguards are alreadythere.\" But the bill drew opposition from the Board of Teaching, the state's largest teach-ers union, and individual teachers. \"The effect really is to allow untrained or partially trained people to serve in the capac-ity of a teacher,\" said Cheryl Furrer, a lobby-ist for the Minnesota Education Association. Since 1985, state law has allowed districts to hire nonlicensed experts to teach on alimited basis, but districts first must get ap-proval from the Board of Teaching. The board must base its decision on the individual's qualifications, the district's needto hire someone other than a licensed teacher,the amount of time the expert would spendin the classroom, and other factors. Districts have filed 15 applications to hire nonlicensed experts since the law took effectand 13 of those applications have been ap-proved, according to Judy Wain, executivesecretary for the board.Tuma's bill would allow districts to make final decisions about hiring nonlicensed in-dividuals, but districts would have to com-ply with a new requirement that they reportto the Board of Teaching on the perfor-mance of the individuals. The proposal also would add a require- ment that districts conduct a criminal back-ground check on nonlicensed applicants forteaching positions. The bill would not \"dismantle or weaken teacher licensure,\" said Susan Heegaard, di-rector of intergovernmental affairs for theDepartment of Children, Families and Learn-ing. Rather, Heegaard said, the bill would sim- plify the process allowing districts to tap intopools of expertise often cut off from theclassroom. She pointed out that a legislatorwho does not have a teaching license cannotteach a high school government class but ateacher who has never been to the Capitolcan. \"We need those who have real-world ex- perience and those who have lots of class-room experience,\" Heegaard said. \"You needto have both types of teaching to occur tobetter prepare kids.\" Opponents of the bill said current law allows nonlicensed experts into the class-room, while providing oversight that en-sures consistency on a statewide basis. \"The Board of Teaching has no desire to be obstructionists. That is not our position,\"said Board Member Marilu Theodore. \"Thisis a valuable process. It is not cumbersome,unwieldy or unduly bureaucratic. And itworks.\" Changing school schedules The House passed a bill March 3 that would make it easier for school districts toestablish year-round school or other alter-native schedules. The vote was 129-0. HF302 , sponsored by Rep. Mindy Greil- ing (DFL-Roseville), would do away with arequirement in current law that makes dis-tricts receive the approval of the State Boardof Education before establishing a flexiblelearning year program at a particular school. Such a program could include a four-day school week or an elimination of the tradi-tional summer vacation in favor of classesfor 45 out of every 60 days. Under current law, a district wishing to establish a flexible learning year for a schoolsite must submit an application to the Boardof Education, which has the authority toreview the plans and approve or disapprove.9 March 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYGreiling's bill would give local school dis- trict officials the authority to decide whetherto establish a flexible learning year and wouldrelegate the Board of Education to a supervi-sory role. HF302 now goes to the Senate. ELECTIONS Absentee voting A bill that would ease voting by absentee ballot cleared the House General Legisla-tion, Veterans Affairs and Elections Com-mittee March 3, after failing to gain approvalseveral weeks ago. HF74 would eliminate the existing quali- fications for voting by absentee ballot thatrequire people to provide a reason for theirinability to go to the polls. Instead, any voter could request to vote by absentee ballot. \"This is a simple bill that would allow people to vote statewide without [providingspecific] qualifications,\" said Rep. TomOsthoff (DFL-St. Paul), the bill's sponsor. Under current law, voters must provide one of several reasons to vote outside anofficial polling place: an expected absencefrom discipline; observance of a religiousholiday; or service as an election judge inanother precinct. The new legislation wouldread: \"Any eligible voter may vote by absen-tee ballot as provided in this chapter.\" Opening the process of absentee balloting Secretary of State Joan Anderson Growe answeredquestions on a bill (HF74) during a March 3 meetingof the General Legislation, Veterans Affairs andElections Committee that would make it easier tovote by absentee ballot.is intended to increase voter participation,according to Osthoff and Secretary of StateJoan Growe, who also testified before thecommittee. In Ramsey County, where a four-year pilot program for unrestricted absenteeballoting began in 1993, absentee voters havegrown to 12 percent, compared with a state-wide average of 6 percent. The bill's sponsors believe that eliminat- ing the inconvenience of getting to a pollingplace will encourage some people, such asthe elderly, to vote. The absentee ballot initiative is not the same as a vote-by-mail program, Osthoffsaid. In the latter, ballots are automaticallysent to all registered voters. Participants mustrequest ballots to vote by absentee ballotunder the pending legislation. HF74 now moves to the House floor. EMPLOYMENTAppliaction YouthBuild builds lives Minnesota's YouthBuild Program helps at-risk youth turn their lives around by gain-ing skills and experience in the constructiontrades and completing their educations, itsproponents say. But due to inadequate fund-ing, the program is turning away many eli-gible youth, witnesses told the HouseEconomic Development and InternationalTrade Committee's Housing and HousingFinance Division March 6. A bill ( HF834 ) sponsored by division chair Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls) would add$400,000 to the $600,000 that Gov. ArneCarlson already has recommended for theprogram in his biennial budget. YouthBuild participants must be between 16 and 24 years old and considered \"at-risk.\"Target groups include dropouts and poten-tial dropouts, youth involved with the juve-nile justice system, chemically dependentyouth, those with disabilities, youth in fostercare, teen parents, and public assistance re-cipients. A unique requirement of the program is that work projects must result in the expan-sion or improvement of residential units forhomeless people and very low income fami-lies or social service, educational, or healthfacilities that primarily serve these popula-tions. YouthBuild has the cooperation ofseveral building trade unions including thoserepresenting carpenters, bricklayers, andpipefitters. In 1996, 324 youth participated in YouthBuild, according to the Department ofEconomic Security. More than 80 percent ofthe participants successfully completed the program. A recent follow-up study indi-cated that 70 percent had obtained their highschool diploma or GED, 15 percent enrolledin postsecondary schools, 15 percent en-tered the building trades, and 50 percentwere employed at a starting wage averaging$7 per hour. Approximately 375 homelessand low-income people and families alsobenefitted from the work done byYouthBuild. Jerome Jones told the panel that YouthBuild helped him turn his life around.\"In 11th grade I was incarcerated for fouryears,\" he said, holding his nephew on hislap. \"When I got out I ran into YouthBuild.It gave me an opportunity to think about myfuture. I took advantage of it to leave the badcrowd alone and come to the good crowd. Igot my GED and a scholarship to go to tradeschool. I've set goals for myself and they aregoing to get achieved.\" Another program participant, Jewel Jones, left welfare, finished her GED, and receiveda full scholarship to study bricklaying at atechnical school. \"The program really needsthe proper tools,\" she said. Tony Evans, YouthBuild program man- ager at Summit Academy in Minneapolis,said that he sees many more youth than theprogram can currently serve. \"When I do anorientation, I get 70 or 80 eager applicantsand can only let five in. You wonder whatwill happen to the others.\" Next, the bill will be taken up by the Eco- nomic Development and International TradeFinance Division. Jerome Jones held his 2-year-old nephew, TyreeseRohr, while testifying before the Housing andHousing Finance Division March 6 in support of abill (HF834) that would increase funding for thestate's YouthBuild program. The program ishelping Jerome earn his GED and improve hiscommunication skills.10 SESSION WEEKLY / March 7, 1997HEALTHGOVERNMENT Privacy vs. Technology Envision this: You get up in the morning and almost every action is recorded or con-trolled through electronic technology. Yourspeed on the freeway, your arrival in youroffice, the phone calls you make, the timeyou spend in the bathroom, and the time youleave the office are all duly noted. If you callin sick to work, your insurance company isnotified. Some will recognize the scenario as not all that far-fetched. The technology exists toperform each function, and in varying ca-pacities, is already in use. Who is controllingthat information and who has a right toaccess it? That was the topic of discussion at the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommit-tee on Data Practices meeting Feb. 28. Living in an information society is affect- ing our lives in an increasing number ofways, according to Don Gemberling, direc-tor of the Public Information Policy Analy-sis Division of the Minnesota Department ofAdministration. Gemberling outlined Minnesota's Data Practices Act for members, which, since 1974,has addressed privacy issues and what infor-mation can be released by the government.What began as a three-page law now con-sumes nearly 70 pages in Minnesota Statutes . \"Increasingly at issue is the disposition of governmental records,\" he said, as the abilityto collect data grows. With the advent of the Internet and other electronic media, the question of data con-trol has grown more complicated. One areaof concern in this environment is medicalrecords, which Gemberling said can be usedand disseminated in an uncounted numberof ways. \"I'm careful to never leave a hair or a fingernail where anyone else can get it. Some-one could map your entire DNA structure,\"he added, only half-jokingly. \"Once you moveany function into the electronic arena, youcreate records, trails, and data.\" Gemberling also mentioned the advent of \"smart cards,\" which people eventually willcarry in their wallets and will contain a com-puter chip with detailed information aboutthe individual. Bills have been introducedthis session to fund a pilot project using thecards. State employees would serve as theexperimental subjects. \"Some day we may all be asked to carry these,\" Gemberling said. \"They'll have onthem thousands of pieces of informationabout us which we cannot read. We'll have to go to someone else and trust that they haveour interests at heart and will tell us thetruth. We've never had a comparable thingin history.\" The availability of electronically acquired data can both enhance or interfere with citi-zens' rights, he said. The most powerful toolcitizens have is the Minnesota GovernmentData Practices Act, which, Gemberling said,presumes that all government data are pub-lic and that citizens have a right to freeaccess. \"I don't know how we could makerepresentative democracy work without it,\"he said. The subcommittee drafts a bill each year to amend the state's Data Practices Act. Theassembly of this year's proposal will occurlater in the session. Governor's phone bills In the first official face-to-face meeting since a telephone bill controversy sproutedseveral weeks ago, representatives from thegovernor's office and members of the Legis-lature met March 5 to discuss the problem. At issue is how much of the cellular tele- phone bills generated by the governor's of-fice should be open to the public. Inresponding to a request for the bills, thegovernor's office censored portions that de-tailed the locations and telephone numbersof the incoming calls. Tanja Kozicky, the governor's legal coun- sel, told the House Judiciary Commitee'sData Practices Subcommittee that the de-leted information was confidential and thatthe governor's office was constrained by lawfrom revealing it. \"We don't object to releasing records we're required to release. But we can't release indi-vidual telephone numbers that are protectedin the Data Practices Act,\" Kozicky said. A bill ( HF902 ) sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) would specify thatthe cellular phone bills of legislators, thegovernor, and other state employees andofficeholders which are paid for by taxpayerswould be \u2014 in their entirety \u2014 public data.The proposal would be retroactive to May1993. The retroactive provision creates more problems, Kozicky said, because the peoplewhose identities could be revealed had aright to be warned. \"People gave us informa-tion with the understanding that it would beused responsibly,\" Kozicky said. The request also covers an estimated 133,000 calls and would require thegovernor's office to take the time and ex- pense of sorting through each to determinewhich are protected. But Entenza and Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL- Mpls) suggested that the governor's officewas asking for a different standard from thatthe Legislature follows. \"The Legislative phone records have been open for four years and we haven't seen anyproblems,\" Entenza said. \"Present law holdsthat the phone records should be open to thepublic.Why would the governor's office findthat the openness we've had wouldn't workfor them? They should come forward withspecific reasons why we should exempt somerecords.\" Skoglund asked: \"Are your calls more from whistleblowers,\" Kozicky oftenthe forum of last resort.\" Kozicky said an-other relevant scenario is when the governor'soffice becomes involved in negotiations toattract a company to Minnesota or in per-suading an existing business to stay. In suchcases, she said, \"confidentiality is absolutelykey\". Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights), committee chair, said the law fa-vors openness, but concurred with Kozickythat the Data Practices Act could stand re-view. But, she added, \"Three years ago, weheard much more public sentiment to openrecords than to keep them private.\" The committee did not vote on HF902 but will discuss it at a future date. Keeping track of shots A bill to create a statewide immunization registry for all Minnesota children was ap-proved by the House Health and HumanServices Committee March 4, but some law-makers promised to amend it as it movedthrough the process. The registry would remind parents when immunizations against measles, Hepatitis Aand B, polio, and other diseases are due andallow the records to follow children through-out their lives even if they move to a differentcounty or change doctors or health plans. At issue is whether creating a statewide registry intrudes on a family's right to pri-vacy and whether there is enough flexibilityin the bill to allow for a family to opt out ofthe registry.11 March 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY As the bill stands now, there is no option for a family to opt out. Consent is not neededbefore enrolling an individual on the regis-try. The bill ( HF259 ) is on its way to the Judi- ciary Committee where amendments per-taining to data privacy are expected. Rep. Nora Slawik (DFL-Maplewood), sponsor of the bill, said a statewide registry isvery important, especially since families to-day are much more mobile and the list ofnecessary immunizations has grown consid-erably. She noted that if families were allowed to boycott the registry, it would be difficult forthe Department of Health to know who hasn'tbeen vaccinated and notify them in the eventof an outbreak. The bill permits the Department of Health to create a statewide registry using informa-tion from community-based registriesthroughout Minnesota. Several communityregistries already are up and running. So far33 Minnesota counties have access to a reg-istry to keep track of who is immunized andfor which disease. In Hennepin County, for example, a group of 160 clinics are tracking some 20,000 chil-dren, said Scott Giebink, chair of pediatricsat the University of Minnesota who testifiedin favor of the bill. In northwestern Minne-sota, 13 counties have joined together andare tracking some 2,500 births per year. Thebill, however, does not make it mandatorythat a county or group of communities setup a registry. Giebink said a statewide registry is impor- tant because each community-based regis-try needs to be linked to be effective andshare information. And, he pointed out, de-spite educating parents, doctors, and healthplans, some 30 percent of 2-year-olds areunder immunized. Under the bill, immunization data that would be shared with the state and amongother registries would include the patient'sname, date of birth, gender, address, legalmother's name, and any indicators that sug-gest a vaccine is not advisable for a particularpatient. The Department of Health also would be instructed to come back to the 1998 Legisla-ture with recommendations on who shouldhave access to the immunization data, howto certify community-based registries, andhow an individual can appeal the sharing ofhis or her immunization data. The bill also requires doctors, health plans, and other health care providers to reportimmunization data to the certified registryin their area. Not only must data be reportedon children born in the area but on people who move into the community as well. Several groups testified against the bill, including the Minnesota Family Council.Tom Prichard of the council questioned theneed for a registry because many childrenare up-to-date with all their shots. He also said that state involvement in immunizations would usurp parental re-sponsibility. Jim Van Horn of the Christian Science Church said he was concerned how such aregistry \"might be used in a negative way\" bygovernment. He said that people of his religious affilia- tion do not feel that they are putting theirchildren in danger if they choose not toimmunize them. Although the bill does not require immu- nizations by those who claim medical, reli-gious, or other exemptions, it does not allowthem to opt out of being placed on the reg-istry. Members of the committee agreed that immunizations are very important, but noteveryone agreed on what role the state shouldplay. Rep. Tom Huntley (DFL-Duluth) remem- bers the polio epidemic and life before avaccine. \"There were seven or eight cases ofpolio on my block,\" he said. Pools wereclosed and quarantine signs were widespread. A statewide immunization registry would \"help make sure that those few kids who areleft [not immunized]. . .get the vaccine theyneed,\" he said. HOUSING On March 5, Rep. Bill Haas tacked up the last piece of artwork he received from his district'sMonroe Elementary School of Brooklyn Park. This marks the 10th exhibit \u2014 which Haas changesmonthly \u2014 of student creativity to adorn his walls.House GalleryRep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), the only physician in the Legislature, said im-munizations are absolutely necessary butadded \"I do have a little problem with a stateregistry\" as it relates to data privacy. He began an immunization program de- cades ago in Lincoln County and achieved100 percent immunization in the schools. After a stop at the Judiciary Committee, HF259 is expected to travel to the Health and Human Services Finance Division where aprice tag is expected to be attached to theproposal. Addressing lead contamination According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, lead poisoning is the number oneenvironmental threat to America's children.Exposure to even an infinitesimal amount oflead can have devastating effects on a smallchild, and can lead to a lower growth rate,lower intelligence, impaired hearing, behav-ioral problems, and severe metabolicproblems. A bill ( HF843 ) sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls) would establish an advisorytask force on lead hazard reduction, and ap-propriate $1 million to fund lead cleanup ef-forts already in place. The bill was approvedMarch 4 by the House Economic Develop-ment and International Trade Committee'sHousing and Housing Finance Division.12 SESSION WEEKLY / March 7, 1997In addition to representatives from the Legislature and state government, the 15-member task force would include landlords,tenants, attorneys, parents of lead-poisonedchildren, insurers, educators, doctors,realtors, the Children's Defense Fund, thefederal Environmental Protection Agency,and local health boards. The task force would study and propose a program to certify residential rental prop-erty as lead-safe (meaning that no lead con-taminants are accessible to children). Thegroup would also propose essential mainte-nance practices to ensure that a residenceremain lead-safe after certification. The le-gal rights and liabilities of tenants and land-lords also would be studied in regard toproviding lead-safe housing and in caseswhere a child is lead poisoned. Mary Johnson of the Phillips Lead Pre- vention Project told the panel about the leadpoisoning of her child. \"A few weeks after Imoved into a house in the Phillips neighbor-hood [of south Minneapolis] I started notic-ing changes in my 16-month-old daughter,\"Johnson said. \"She started getting graystrands in her hair, her joints ached, and shehad stomach pains.\" Johnson's daughter was tested and found to have an elevated level of lead in her blood.The source was lead paint chips in the bath-room and kitchen of the home. Johnsonmoved to a safe house while her landlordaddressed the lead problem, but when shemoved back, her daughter's blood-lead levelrose again due to the higher volume of leaddust the work had stirred up. They laterfound a new apartment that was certified aslead-safe. \"Three months after we moved [tothe new apartment] my daughter's lead levelfinally went down,\" Johnson said. She and other witnesses urged the passage of HF843 to restore funding for the \"swab team\" approach to help families and com-munities deal with the lead problem. Swabteams are called in when a home with chil-dren is identified as having a lead problem.The team takes measures to make the homelead-safe rather than lead-free. Lead-basedpaint is typically wet scraped and coveredwith a latex enamel. The home is then vacu-umed with a machine equipped with specialfilters that trap the finest particles of leaddust. Experience has shown that this is thesafest and most cost effective approach, saidClark. The measure now goes to the House Eco- nomic Development and International TradeCommittee.Housing discrimination? A bill to study whether discrimination is occurring on a widespread basis in the rentalhousing market won approval from a Housepanel March 6. The proposal ( HF552 ) comes on the heels of a report on the rental housing markets intwo Minneapolis neighborhoods last yearwhich found that prospective tenants werebeing discriminated against because of theirrace in 70 percent of the cases studied. Thereport was conducted by the Minnesota FairHousing Center for the Minneapolis De-partment of Civil Rights. In the study, two people who were nearly identical, except for their race, were sent tothe same place to look for housing. Theirexperiences were recorded, and then com-pared by a testing coordinator to determineif there were any differences in treatment. Ofthe 72 properties tested, 52 showed a differ-ence in treatment based on race, family sta-tus, or public assistance status. The discrimination ranged from the rental agent making overtly race-based commentsto imposing more stringent requirementson the African-American prospective ten-ants. Often neither visitor was aware of thediscrimination, which emerged only whenthe test results were compared. African-American clients were often shown inferiorapartments in the same building and notencouraged to fill out rental applications,while white applicants were offered betterunits and urged to fill out rental applicationsbefore leaving. Some of the cases resulted in civil rights charges being filed against the discriminat-ing property owners. \"When I first read this report, I was quite shocked,\" said bill sponsor Rep. Matt Entenza(DFL-St. Paul). HF552 would mark $50,000 for the state Department of Human Rightsto conduct similar studies. The bill was ap-proved by the Economic Development andInternational Trade Committee's Housingand Housing Finance Division. \"It is a good idea to conduct these tests,\" he said, \"because it lets landlords know thatthey can't get away with discrimination. Italso sends a message to our communities ofcolor that they can live where they choose inMinnesota.\" Human rights spokesman Dan Nicolai told the panel that the department agrees thattesting needs to be done and would contractthe work to organizations that have a trackrecord conducting such tests. The bill now goes to the Judiciary Com- mittee.Designing affordable housing In 1995, the Legislature passed an initia- tive to develop innovative affordable hous-ing designs through an architecturalcompetition. However, no money was ap-propriated to run the contest. Rep. Dan McElroy (R-Burnsville), spon- sor of the original initiative, has introduceda bill ( HF592 ) which would provide ap- proximately $100,000 for the contest. It wasapproved by the House Economic Develop-ment and International Trade Committee'sHousing and Housing Finance DivisionMarch 4. If the measure passes, the Minnesota Hous- ing Finance Agency would announce a \"de-signed affordable\" housing competition opento architects, architectural schools, and non-profit and for-profit housing developers.\"Designed affordable\" means that state-of-the-art materials and construction tech-niques are used to bring down the total costof housing units, said McElroy. The per-unitcost could be reduced by as much as $3,000to $5,000 with a good design, he said. As an example, McElroy cited new wall materials that eliminate the laborious tap-ing, mudding, sanding, and painting neededto finish a conventional wall. \"They attachthe wall panels and put paper directly overthat,\" he said. \"It looks better than a conven-tional finish.\" \"Since you first introduced this idea two years ago, members of my extended familyhave gotten homes like this,\" said Rep. Bar-bara Sykora (R-Excelsior). \"They are verynice homes and were very reasonably priced.\" Traditionally, affordable housing has been achieved by either letting older housing de-teriorate until it is affordable or by subsidiz-ing new construction, McElroy said. \"Thecontest would challenge the state's best andbrightest architects to come up with someinnovative cost-saving designs for new hous-ing.\" Prizes of $50,000, $35,000, and $25,000 would be offered for first, second and thirdplace winners of the design contest, McElroysaid. All the designs would become the prop-erty of the state and would be made availableto local developers of affordable housing. HF592 will be included in the omnibus housing finance bill to be taken up later thissession.13 March 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYLABOR LAW OUTSTATEHuman rights loopholes Two bills approved by the House Labor- Management Relations Committee wouldextend human rights protection to thosewho now fall through loopholes in the law. HF787 would establish that those con- trolling the work environment are respon-sible for everyone working at that location,and therefore, are also accountable if anydiscrimination takes place. Rep. Bill Hilty (DFL-Finlayson), the bill's sponsor, explained that many businesses nowcontract jobs out to individuals or serviceproviders for services such as security, ac-counting, or payroll to be done on the busi-ness' premises but with anotherorganization's employees. The state's Hu-man Rights Act now defines an employer asa person with \"one or more employees.\" If abusiness is charged with discriminationagainst a contract employee, it can argue thatsince the person is actually employed by anoutside agency, the contracting business isnot responsible for any discriminatory actsperpetrated against them. The agency providing services, which is the employer of record in these cases, alsodenies responsibility, said Hilty, because theyare not in control of the workplace where thediscrimination took place. Such cases consume an inordinate amount of the department's time and resources be-cause the current law is unclear, said KenNicolai of the Department of Human Ser-vices. \"We ran into a situation where a secu-rity guard was working at a firm where therewas some discrimination. After we investi-gated and found probable cause, we discov-ered there was a problem with the law.\" A second bill ( HF814/SF323* \"individuals\" to the list of groupsprohibited from engaging in acts of reprisalagainst those who file discrimination com-plaints. Under the current law, individuals are covered only if they are employees. If theyquit or are fired, they are free to engage inreprisals against those who complainedagainst them. \"The situation that pointed out the prob- lem to us involved a student attending one ofMinnesota's colleges,\" Nicolai said. \"She fileda sexual harassment complaint against a pro-fessor who was subsequently fired by thecollege. He then took several actions againsther, including filing a lawsuit. We found itconstituted reprisal, but that we had no ju- risdiction over such individuals.\" Both bills now move to the House Judi- ciary Committee. Under-21 ID cards The House Transportation and Transit Committee approved a bill March 3 thatwould clearly mark state identification cardsfor people under the legal drinking age. HF40 , sponsored by Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley), would require state iden-tification cards for people under age 21 toinclude markings similar to drivers' licensesfor that age group. \"We are putting so much effort into trying to curtail the sale of alcohol and tobacco tominors,\" Leppik said. \"This is one way wecan help in that effort.\" Under the bill, identification cards for people under the legal drinking age would bea different color and would be labeled \"Un-der-21.\" The cards would expire on theholder's 21st birthday. Minnesota identification cards, which pro- vide a form of legal identification for non-drivers, are issued by the Department ofPublic Safety. There is a $12.50 fee to receivean identification card, and cards for peopleunder age 65 are normally valid for fouryears. Senior citizens are issued cards thatare good indefinitely. The bill now moves to the House floor. Calling schools long distance The decades-long trend of combining ru- ral school districts has resulted in at least oneunforeseen problem. By blending areas withdifferent telephone exchanges, students of-ten meet friends who require a long-distancetelephone call to reach. Calling the schoolcan mean long-distance charges for parents,and vice versa, even over distances of just afew miles. The effect is burdensome phonebills for some rural school districts and manyof their residents. In southern Minnesota, the towns of West Concord, Claremont and Dodge Center com-bined to form the Triton School District. \"When we formed Triton, we formed a community,\" Superintendent John Hornungtold the House Regulated Industries andEnergy Committee. \"The [merger] has beengreat for the community, but our phone bills are atrocious.\" Hornung has installed toll-free lines into each of the district's schools ata cost of about $6,000 a year. But that solvesonly one part of the problem. HF211 , which would make it easier for rural communities to eliminate such long-distance costs, received the committee's ap-proval March 4. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), would change the way custom-ers within a school district can petition thePublic Utilities Commission to install ex-tended area service (EAS), which would lo-calize the exchanges and eliminate thelong-distance charges. Its most importantprovision would eliminate a requirementthat at least half of the customers make atleast three phone calls per month to ex-changes outside of their own to qualify forEAS service, Sviggum said. School districtresidents would need to vote on the phoneservice change, and at least 10 percent of thecustomers in each affected phone exchangemust live within the combined school dis-trict. \"The bill will enhance the success of com- bined school districts in Minnesota,\" Svig-gum said, adding that the telephone situationis one of the biggest problems they face. But Victor Dobras of the Sprint Corpora- tion and president of the Minnesota Tele-phone Association, said that EAS was not themost practical alternative for the communi-ties. The association opposes the bill on fourgrounds: New rules are currently in progress regard- ing calls between exchanges, which makesthe EAS effort premature. The law would invite many more EAS petitions. Without the threshold test, the EAS peti- tion may fail. EAS is overkill. Using 1-800 service is one solution, Dobras suggested. Furthermore, he said, \"The billmay or may not make a significant differencein the speed of the process. You still needtraffic and cost studies.\" HF211 now goes to the House floor.

The editors14 SESSION WEEKLY / March 7, 1997The United States, now the world's \"technology pio-neer,\" could lose that statusto a Japanese governmentbent on becoming the globaleconomy's dominant player,former Vice President andU.S. Ambassador to JapanWalter Mondale told a gath-ering of Minnesota legisla- tors March 4. \"A good measure of their determination is money,\" Mondale said. \"Last summer, theJapanese cabinet approved a plan to spendan additional $155 billion on governmentscience and technology programs over thenext five years.\" That increase, he said, represents only slightly less than our government's entirecivilian research and development budgetfor the same period. Mondale, in addition to his turns as vice president and ambassador, served as aMinnesota's U.S. senator and attorney gen-eral. He is currently a partner in theMinneapolis-based law firm Dorsey andWhitney. He made his remarks at theMinnesota History Center's 3M audi-torium as the fourth speaker in the Capi-tol Forum Series. The series, sponsoredby Minnesota Technology and theMcKnight Foundation, is designed topresent legislators with a more expan-sive view of the circumstances in whichthey make policy decisions. America, Mondale said, has drawn on its rich history of entrepreneurshipand belief in the potential of the indi-vidual, combined with a long-standingcommitment to higher education andresearch, to achieve its position of tech-nological dominance. Conversely, Japan has traditionally relied on its group-oriented culture andbureaucratic meritocracy, operating ina strictly regulated and overprotectedeconomy. It would seem, he said, that the United States' innate ability to adapt quicklywould provide a natural competitiveadvantage in the global economy. Butthat is not necessarily so. In fact, Mondale said, our position is threatened. Japan's strategy to overtakethe U.S. is fourfold. It includes: doubling the government's allocation Capitol Forum Series . . . Mondale details prescription for global success Former U.S. Senator, Vice President, and U.S. Ambassador toJapan Walter Mondale spoke to an audience at the MinnesotaHistory Center about Japan and Minnesota's role in theexpanding Pacific Rim economy. He spoke as part of the CapitolForum Series March 4.of tax dollars to science and technologyprograms, especially basic research; reforming the education system to promote more independent thinking; expanding the amount of available venture capital; and targeting certain foreign technologies for Japanese development. There are, he said, already signs that the Japanese effort is succeeding. For example,the latest list of the top 10 patent recipientsfrom the U.S. Patent Office contained thenames of eight Japanese corporations. More-over, Japan has made substantial gains inseven critical technology categories. Meanwhile, Mondale said, America con- tinues to \"permit the very basis of our wealthto disintegrate\" by neglecting to supportscience and technology efforts, particularlyin the area of K-12 education. \"We need to do a much better job of public education in both America and Minnesota,\"Mondale said. \"We can no longer afford towaste the talents of countless young people.\"To remain economically strong, Mondale said, the U.S. needs to place a renewedemphasis on science and math educationand our schools must prepare students for afuture in which the Pacific Rim nations willplay a much larger role. Japan, Mondale said, also represents a fantastic economic opportunity for Minne-sota and the U.S. Indeed, he continued, weshould do everything possible to encourageAsian investment instead of instinctivelytightening up our markets. Partnerships withJapanese companies could prove extremelyprofitable. Certainly, Japan is coming on strong, but fundamental differences exist between thetwo countries, Mondale said. As long asAmerica builds on its strengths \u2014 individu-ality, entrepreneurship, and education\u2014 the country will continue to thrive in theglobal economy. \"As legislators . . . you are in a superb position to persuade Minnesotans of thecrucial role that science and technology will play in the future of our citizens,\"Mondale said. \"High technology is theessential element of economic growth.It is America's crucial advantage in in-ternational commerce.\" Many legislators said they were in- trigued by Mondale's remarks. \"The idea of Japan as an opportu- nity rather than a threat is an interest-ing thought,\" said Rep. Dan McElroy(R-Burnsville). \"The emphasis on cre-ativity is important.\" McElroy said he doesn't know of any of his constituents who do businessin Japan, and the few companies he isaware of that do usually employ agents. Rep. Torrey Westrom (R-Elbow Lake) said the scenarios outlined byMondale presented policymakers withan opportunity to implement furtherwelfare reform. Legislators, he said,could target some education dollarstoward providing instruction in tech-nological fields to people now receiv-ing government assistance. \"With the technological age we're moving into,\" Westrom said, \"there'sgoing to have to be a commitment tothat.\" \u2014 F.J. Gallagher15 March 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYSession Weekly: Have you had a chance to stay in touch with the issues confrontingMinnesota? Mondale: I would say not very much. I al- ways read the local papers when I was inJapan, but it's always once removed and I'mnot as up to date on specific issues as I mayonce have been. Session Weekly: Given the state of the Japa- nese stock market and their economy rightnow, and looking at ours, which is just rag-ing \u2014 very much like theirs was maybe adecade or so ago \u2014 is there something thatwe could, or perhaps should, learn fromJapan? Mondale: You know, Japan is in a period of trouble now, there's no question about it.It's had sluggish growth, the stock market'scratered, they've got a lot of bad debts and allsorts of things like that so, like all complexsocieties, there are some things that aren'tworking. It needs badly to deregulate, openup and so on. But I would say the topic oftoday's speech, centering on technology, alsopoints out some of it's strengths. Japan is thelargest reserve nation in the world. It hasenormous cash reserves and it's decided toincrease support for the sciences by almostthe same amount that we spend a year \u2014 justin the increases over the next five years \u2014and while it's got other problems in theirscientific field, this will help them moveforward in science technology. In theirschools, they have a very strong program insciences \u2014 in K-12 \u2014 and they get resultsfrom that. It's got other handicaps, but theJapanese are a resilient, diligent people andwhile they're having some difficulties now,the economy \u2014 particularly the export side\u2014 is doing very well and some of that ispretty advanced stuff. Session Weekly: To that point, I'm sure you're familiar with the dispute between[Japan-based] NEC and [Minnesota-based]Cray over the supercomputer being pur-chased by the National Atmospheric Re-search Center. Would it be wise for theFormer U.S. Senator, Vice President, and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale has returned to his home state of Minnesota, where hewas interviewed on issues both state and global before his CapitolForum Series speech March 5 at the Minnesota History Center. United States government to institute a U.S.-only policy with regard tosupercomputers? Mondale: No, I don't think so. One of the great strengths of the United States is that wehave been willing to permit competition, butit has to be competition according to theinternational rules. The question in the Cray/NEC case that you refer to involves the charge\"dumping.\" That is, the charge is \u2014 therehaven't been any hearings \u2014 that NEC camein and charged a price that had to be beneaththeir cost. Now, I think NEC has refused tosubmit to the proceedings, so what's goingto happen, I don't know. But let me go backto my basic point. I think that keeping openAmerican markets while insistingothers play by the rules has served our coun-try well because you can't hide, and if you do,the others will quickly take the example anddefine its role in terms of the U2000 policy \u2014 are we a research institute or are we ateaching institute. Where do you see theUniversity in Minnesota's economy as wetry to become a player in this globaleconomy? Mondale: Well, the University is what one of our presidents once called the \"jewel in thecrown\" of our state. It is essential to all of ourhopes. There are many, many other impor-tant institutions, I don't wish to be misun-derstood, but the University has thosegraduate schools, they have the centers ofresearch and excellence. If you look at thenumber of companies in Minnesota, high-tech companies, that directly or indirectlycome from that relationship, you get an ideaof how heavily our future is bound up. So Iwould say, you know, that the university hasmany, many different roles to play. One isthe undergraduate role. I was an under-graduate there, first at Macalester College,and then I went to the University of Minne-sota Law School. It gave me my chance andit has done the same for thousands and thou-sands of young people for well over, what,140 years or so. So I wouldn't pick out one go clear beyond. The United States has a lot at stake in a more open international tradingand financial system. We're doing very well;we're the most productive nation on earth.We're the most advanced scientific and tech-nological nation. I think we're the best agri-culture nation, all sorts of bests. Thisworld-global idea is made for us. We've gotto master it. Session Weekly: You're a newly elected member of the University of MinnesotaFoundation's Board of Trustees. TheUniversity right now is really struggling toarea and say, \"you have to be good here,\" and forget the others, but I will be emphasizingin my remarks the importance of pushingforward in high technology, science and re-search. Session Weekly: Now, you mentioned the University giving you your chance. Manypeople, young people now entering the jobmarket for the first time, particularly thosewith graduate degrees, are doing so withstaggering burdens of debt. Is there any-thing that can be done to help these peopleout? We've got problems, but I wouldn't want to trade our situation for anybody's. Japan's got a lot of problems, Europe's got a lot of problems [but] we should not be cocky because we're no longer the world's sole repository of science and technology. . . . I think we're the best, but we have to continue to invest in that and insist on that and work on that. That's the challenge for our time. \u2014 former U.S. Ambassador Walter F. MondaleExclusive interview . . .16 SESSION WEEKLY / March 7, 1997Mondale: Well, I think this is one place where people ought to take a good look at thepresident's program. He's talking about taxdeductibility, and I think some tax credits,for community colleges in the early years;he's talking about some kind of pattern onGeorgia, some kind of special grant for youngpeople that do well, and he's talking aboutincreasing the investment in K-12 and inother ways trying to close the gap some. . . .He's also going to increase the basic oppor-tunity grants \u2014 the so-called Pell grants, sothat good students, but poorer students, interms of economics, will get a larger grant tocover some of this gap when they go tocollege, and he's talking about somethinglike $50 million. It's a big program. But Idon't think it will totally close that gap. Theproblem is called money. At the same time,we're trying to bring the deficit down and soon, but I think that's the most significantproposal on the table right now. Session Weekly: The President has said he wants to wire every classroom in the coun-try. Is that technology for technology'ssake? Is that something we need to watchout for when we consider technology edu-cation?Mondale: You know, I don't know the an- swer to that question. I know that the ideabehind his proposal is to permit the youngpeople in school, all over the country, nomatter where they live or the wealth of theirparents, to be able to connect with the world. Session Weekly: To sort of level the playing field? Mondale: Well, it levels it up, so to speak. It's not leveling it down. It will allow people tohook in to all these forms of internationalcommunications and that strikes me as agood idea. Beyond that, I don't have anygrasp of the details. Session Weekly: In terms of America's place in the global economy, particularly with aunifying Europe, where do you seeAmerica's greatest challenge, and thenMinnesota's challenge, as things are con-stantly shifting? Mondale: I think that we have to stay, obvi- ously, the scientific and technological leaderof the world or we'll slip behind \u2014 andthere's no reason why we should lose thatedge because we're ahead of the others inmany, many ways . . . and I think our goal has to be to do better. We have to build on ourstrengths which are just right for this newworld, and we have to make certain that ourK-12 kids get a better chance, get a bettereducation, more kids can go on to college. . . that entrepreneurship is encouraged andthat we honor and support education andresponsible individuals and all the rest. We'vegot problems, but I wouldn't want to tradeour situation for anybody's. Japan's got a lotof problems, Europe's got a lot of problems[but] we should not be cocky because we'reno longer the world's sole repository of sci-ence and technology. There are a lot of othergood students . . . around the world. I thinkwe're the best, but we have to continue toinvest in that and insist on that and work onthat. That's the challenge for our time.Minnesota has the same sort of problems atthe state level. We have to stay out ahead.Practically every one of these high-tech com-panies, you can trace to somebody from theUniversity of Minnesota or one of our otherinstitutions that had an idea, they created it,and now it's a big business. We have to keepthat energy and level of sophistication. That'sthe key. \u2014 F.J. Gallagher Do you know?During the last two presidential cam- paigns, Americans flirted with the idea\u2014 primarily in the form of Ross Perot \u2014of embracing a candidate who is neither Republican nor Democrat. While no third-party hopeful has ever becomepresident, Minnesota voters elected Gov.Floyd B. Olson in 1930, the state's firstFarmer-Labor chief executive, to the firstof three terms. The only child of Scandinavian immi- grant parents, Olson exhibited a healthymistrust of authority in his youth. As astudent at the University of Minnesota,he refused to participate in what werethen compulsory military drills. Ulti- mately, Olson left the university after only one year, choosing to instead be-come a student in the school of hardknocks. He spent the next 12 months working a variety of blue-collar jobs, learning first- hand about the market forces that pro- duced both fantastic wealth and grindingpoverty \u2014 apparently indiscriminately,in his view. By all accounts, Olson's expe-riences during this period of his lifebrought to the forefront the young man's already strong social conscience. At the beginning, according to ThePolitical Career of Floyd B. Olson by George H. Mayer, Olson maintained hisofficial status as a Democrat, even seek-ing the party's nomination in the con- gressional races of 1918 and 1920. Yet his first political appointment came fromthe Republican-controlled HennepinCounty Board, who named him assistantcounty attorney in 1919. Eighteen monthslater, the board chose Olson to finish out the term of the Hennepin County attor- ney, who had been removed for chargesof misconduct. Olson held the job for 10years, using the post to build a strongpolitical base. Politics in the Midwest has always been closely tied to agriculture, and the hall-mark of Olson's era was a fiery brand of economic populism with its roots in theGrange and Greenback movements.Farmers organized and reorganized in an astonishing array of coalitions, each with the aim of reforming the system andtaking it out of the hands of controllingcorporate interests. From his position outside traditional party circles, Olson held a natural appeal for reformers, and when the Farmer Labor Federation emerged in 1924, itsleaders picked Olson to run for governoron the party ticket. He lost to RepublicanTheodore Christianson by the narrowestof margins. In 1930, though, Olson reappeared as a candidate for the Farmer Labor Asso-ciation, which had risen out of the ashesof the now-defunct Farmer Labor Fed-eration. This time, Olson won, beatinghis Republican opponent by nearly 25 percent, the largest margin of defeat for a Republican gubernatorial candidate upto that time. Olson won re-election twice after that, firmly establishing the upcoming farmer-labor movement as a legitimate political force, and went on to become one of Minnesota's most beloved governors. Third-party Gov. Floyd. B. Olson17 March 7, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYAfter months of learning a new welfare alphabet anddeciphering all the cuts in a1996 federal welfare law, theMinnesota House has be-gun debating a bill that out-lines how to cope with the changes. The Health and Human Services Com- mittee March 6 heard HF159 , the House's early answer to the tough new federal law. The bill, as it stands now, requires poor families to work to receive welfare, restoressome of the federal cuts to immigrants, lim-its how long a person on welfare can attendschool instead of work, and shares federalpenalties with counties if Minnesota fails tomove enough people into work. The bill, however, is by no means a done deal, said sponsor Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris). \"There is no agreement on this bill.This is open to amendments.\" States across the country are hurrying to pass new welfare laws after the federal gov-ernment scrapped the long-standing welfaresystem in August 1996. The federal law does away with monthly welfare checks and food stamps for manylegal immigrants and eliminates disabilitycash assistance for people with drug andalcohol addictions. It also eliminates cashassistance for children with certain behav-ioral disabilities and requires able-bodiedadults, ages 18-50, who receive food stampsto work. Perhaps the most significant change in- volves poor families with children. The lawTackling welfare . . . Debate begins on initial welfare reform legislation requires these parents to get a job and sets afive-year-lifetime limit on their welfare ben-efits. States that do not move these parents towork will be penalized by the federal govern-ment. Specifically, they'll lose some of theirfederal aid. While the federal law prescribes some of what states are required to do, it leaves eachstate to decide how to design its own welfaresystem. For instance, states are free to restoresome of the cuts if they choose, but theymust use their own money to do it. The Health and Human Services Com- mittee is expected to debate HF159 over the next several days and, if all goes well, vote thebill up or down March 13. Below is a summary of some of the bill's highlights. Work for welfare For several years, Minnesota has experi- mented with a welfare pilot program in eightcounties that requires poor families withchildren to work if they want public assis-tance. Under the bill, that experiment would become permanent beginning Jan. 1, 1998,and spread to all 87 counties in Minnesota. The Minnesota Family Investment Pro- gram, (MFIP) allows families to accept lower-paying jobs while receiving some publicassistance, such as extra monthly cash andsubsidized child and health care. In theory,allowing someone to work while still receiv-ing benefits helps a low-skilled parent gainwork experience and eventually obtain abetter job.MFIP statewide would replace the tradi- tional Aid to Families with Dependent Chil-dren (AFDC) program done away with bythe 1996 federal welfare law. And, in keepingwith federal law, the bill sets a five-year,lifetime limit on receiving MFIP welfarechecks. There are some exceptions to the five-year limit. For example, the bill exempts certainvictims of domestic abuse who need time tofind safety before they can settle into a job. MFIP began in 1994 as a pilot project in seven counties \u2014 Anoka, Dakota, Hennepin,Mille Lacs, Morrison, Sherburne and Todd.Ramsey County was added in July 1996. Sofar about 4,500 families receive welfare un-der MFIP and preliminary study results sug-gest that those people are more likely to workthan those under the old AFDC system. Under the statewide MFIP proposal, a parent or guardian would be required todevelop a job search and employment planand accept any suitable job once they'vecompleted all the steps in their plan. As is thecase now, the state would continue to pay foremployment and job training services, butnot at the same level. Currently, the state spends about $2,000 per person on employment and job trainingservices in the MFIP pilot counties. Mostofficials agree, however, that the state can-not afford to spend that much if it takes theprogram statewide. Just how much the state will spend on employment and training is expected to beoutlined in a separate bill. Money to expand A bill for an act ating to civil actions; modifying and expanding rovisions for sanctions in civil actions; Statutes subdivision 6; and 609.5314, subdivision 3; proposing coding for new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 549; repealing Minnesota Statutes 1994, section 549.21.

Under HF159, there would be penalties for adults who do not work. For the firstoffense, the state would use a family's grantto directly pay off rent and utility bills. Thestate would then give the balance \u2014 minus a10 percent penalty \u2014 to the family. On thesecond offense, the money leftover after rentand utility bills are paid would be cut by 25percent. On the third offense, the moneyleftover would be cut by 35 percent. In terms of schooling, the bill limits the amount of postsecondary education a per-son may receive while on MFIP. Under thecurrent AFDC welfare program, some par-ents are allowed to attend college for fouryears while still receiving their monthly wel-fare check, and subsidized child and healthcare. That would end under HF159 . Generally, the bill limits approved postsecondary ortraining programs to a year or less but doesallow for up to two years if the diploma ordegree can be shown to help the welfareparent earn a better income, and he or sheagrees to pay a portion of the money back. Current AFDC parents who are in the middle of their degree programs would get abreak, however. Under the bill, those AFDCparents enrolled in a degree program as ofMarch 1, 1997, would be allowed to con-tinue in school for up to two years after beingplaced on MFIP. The bill does set income limits on how much a family can earn on the job and stillcontinue to receive a monthly MFIP check. For a family of three, for instance, the bill sets a limit of $1,163 a month. A family ofthree in the current pilot MFIP program, canearn up to $1,554 a month before being cutoff. Officials maintain the state couldn't af-ford the higher cut-off income if the pro-gram goes statewide. Due to the new federal welfare law, states are under a great deal of pressure to movepeople off the welfare rolls and HF159 plans to share that pressure with counties. Under the new federal law, beginning with fiscal year 1997, each state must show that 25percent of families on welfare are working atleast 20 hours per week. By fiscal year 2002,the requirement jumps to 50 percent work-ing at least 30 hours per week. There are cashpenalties for states that do not meet thepercentages. Mirroring the federal law, HF159 would penalize counties. Specifically, the bill wouldforce counties to share in the federal penalty. Although the bill calls for MFIP to go statewide by Jan. 1, 1998, counties have theoption of beginning earlier and would re- ceive a bonus of $100 for each person theymove into a job. Immigrant help Despite being cut off from most welfare programs in the federal law, some legal im-migrants in Minnesota would be taken careof by state dollars, under the bill. The measure, however, requires that the income of a legal immigrant's Americansponsor be considered when determiningeligibility for public assistance. This is inkeeping with the federal law. Under the bill, legal immigrants would be eligible for most welfare programs includ-ing: Medical Assistance (MA), a joint state- federal program that helps people who can'tafford health care. State dollars, however,would have to pay for legal immigrants who,under the federal law, are cut off from theprogram. MFIP, the state's new welfare-to-work program. States receive federal dollars fortheir welfare reform programs but they arenot allowed to use federal money for manylegal immigrants. Minnesota would use statedollars to pay for that population. General Assistance (GA), a state pro- gram that offers help to those in poverty whodo not qualify for other state or federal wel-fare programs. The average benefit is about$203 a month. General Assistance Medical Care (GAMC), a state program that pays for nec-essary health care for those who are ineli-gible for MA or other health care programs.Specifically, elderly, blind or disabled legalimmigrants cut off from a federal programknown as Supplemental Security Income(SSI) would be eligible for Minnesota'sGAMC as long as they cooperate with theImmigration and Naturalization Service andwork toward becoming a citizen or meetsome other standard that would qualify themfor the federal dollar portion of MA. Legal immigrants cut off from SSI also may qualify for some help with their housingcosts. The bill would set aside a pot of moneymeant to make up the difference between a$203 monthly state GA check and the $378monthly federal SSI check many elderly anddisabled immigrants currently receive. Jennings said there are about 400 or 500 immigrant families (mostly in the metro-politan area) who will need the help or losetheir housing. The bill also calls for immigrants cut off from the federal food stamp program toreceive $63 per month for food. In Minne-sota, an estimated 16,000 legal immigrants will lose their food stamps in 1997, under thefederal cuts. The average person receives $63per month in food coupons. To qualify for the money, legal nonciti- zens must be enrolled in a citizenship, lit-eracy or English class, have applied for suchclasses, or applied for a waiver from citizen-ship requirements from the INS. Potpourri Some of the bill's other highlights would: Mandate a 30-day residency requirement to receive welfare and require that, for thefirst year, families who move to Minnesotareceive either the benefit amount theywould have received in their previous state,or Minnesota's rate, whichever is less. Eliminate the $1,500 cap on the value of a welfare recipient's vehicle. Many arguedthat the low value too often meant unreli-able transportation and could cost peopletheir jobs. HF159 would allow each work- ing adult in a household to own a vehiclevalued up to $4,600. Tap into the rental subsidies of some fami- lies on welfare. Specifically, the bill wouldcount $100 of a welfare recipient's rentalsubsidy as part of their income, thus po-tentially reducing their overall welfare ben-efit. This provision helps pay to expandMFIP statewide but it has been criticized asshuffling benefits from one poor person tohelp another. Prohibit certain people from receiving MFIP or other welfare help such as GA. Peopleconvicted of felony drug possession, forinstance, would be barred for five yearsfrom receiving MFIP. Parole violators and felons on the run would be barred completely from receivingwelfare. Those convicted of fraudulently at-tempting to receive benefits in two or morestates at one time would be barred for 10years. Make children with behavioral disorders cut off from the federal SSI program eli-gible for Minnesota's GA welfare program.GA, however, will not make up for theentire federal cut. These children averaged$406 a month while on SSI and GA paysout about $203 a month. Make drug and alcohol addicts cut off from SSI eligible for GA as long as they are intreatment or on a waiting list. They aver-aged about $470 a month while on SSI. \u2014 K.

Mabeth Hurd Paige felt welcomed when she and Rep. Hannah Johnson Kempfer were invited by a male legislator to sit next to him in the Housechamber. Paige found out later that the seats were the worst places in the room to hearlegislative debate. Reps. Myrtle Cain and Sue Metzger Dickey Hough did not get greatseats either. Such was an introduction of the first four women elected to the MinnesotaLegislature. They often endured insults from those who felt that making laws was aprocess for men only. But the first four won. So did 118 others including the 61 females who now serve in the House and Senate. Even in the '20s, women played key roles. They authored billsto increase wages, blocked the Ku Klux Klan from wearing hoods, and promotedwelfare for the indigent. Paige served for 22 years and became the first woman to chaira committee \u2014 Public Welfare and Social Legislation. Kempfer served for 18 years, supporting conservation and the welfare efforts of her colleagues. Welfare bills were tough to pass because the committee was looked downon by men. \"Mother Kempfer,\" as she was called, once made an impassioned speechin support of children. To complete silence in the chamber, Kempfer informed thebody that she was an illegitimate child and was once an orphan. The bill passed. Rep. Helen McMillan was the only female in the Legislature in 1971. During this term, the majority leader said that female employees could not wear pantsuits.McMillan minimized the issue by stating that his demand was \"utterly ridiculous\" andeven threatened to wear them on the House floor in protest. In 1973, she was joined in the House by five females. As a group, they laid the foundation for many others to seek office. Rep. Ernee McArthur served for only oneterm; Rep. Mary Forsythe served nine terms; Rep. Linda Berglin served in the Housefor four terms and continues to serve as a senator; Rep. Phyllis Kahn continues to serveand chairs Governmental Operations. The sixth legislator, Rep. Joan Growe, servedfor three terms before she was elected as the present Secretary of State. By 1992, women in the Legislature were no longer uncommon. Nor did they have to leave the House floor for personal needs. They now had their own restroom off theRetiring room \u2014 something the visionary Cass Gilbert did not foresee. Reps. ConnieLevi and Ann Wynia had already served as majority leaders. Dee Long was the newlyelected Speaker of the House, making her one of two female presiding speakers in thecountry. Long now serves as chair of the Taxes Committee. Seventy-four years later, women have earned their rightful niche in the Legislature. And when they are not serving as legislators, they are biophysicists, teachers, home-makers, visual artists, farm owners, CPAs, and for fun, two even play on the co-edCapitol ice hockey team. Much is attained when \". . . all persons share in government to the utmost.\" \u2014 LeClair G. Lambert3 March 14 , 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . March 6 - 13, 1997 Highlights After weeks of private debate over public financing of a new Minnesota Twins ballpark,Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) has puta stadium bill into play. HF1367 received its first hearing in the House Local Govern-ment and Metropolitan Affairs CommitteeMarch 13. The bill retains many of the ideas pro- posed in the original deal announced earlierthis session by Gov. Arne Carlson and theTwins. Snuffed out is the 10-cent-per-packcigarette tax the governor proposed to payfor the stadium. \"I didn't believe the ciga-rette tax could survive [in the Legislature],\"Rest said last week. Instead, Rest substitutes a 10-percent tax on professional sports team memorabiliaand clothing with team logos sold in Minne-sota. No estimates are as yet available on therevenue potential of the taxes, but Rest saidit would probably not generate as much asthe $33 million annually expected from acigarette tax. The bill drops the retractable roof included in the original stadium design, which re-duces the overall pricetag of $424 million to$330.9 million, according to MetropolitanSports Facilities Commission figures. Addi-tionally, Minneapolis would be designatedas the site for the new stadium, and theHubert H. Humphrey Metrodome would beoperated by the Minnesota Vikings. Other provisions of the bill would imple- ment or expand elements of the originaldeal. The proposal would replace the Minne- sota Sports Facilities Commission with astatewide body to oversee construction ofthe new facility and the public's 49-percentinterest in the Twins. The 11-member com-mission, appointed by the governor, wouldhave a broad charge to negotiate with theTwins. By mutual agreement, the commis-sion and the Twins would determine thesize, amenities, and design of the stadium, aswell as the selection of the architect andgeneral contractor. The commission wouldbe empowered to negotiate with the city ofMinneapolis and Hennepin County to pro-vide the necessary infrastructure for the fa-Play ball . . . Proposed Twins stadium bill in play in the House cility. The commission also would be autho-rized to issue up to $25 million in revenuebonds for preparing the specified site forconstruction. The bill would require the Twins to sign a 30-year lease for the stadium and turn over49 percent of their net operating profits tothe commission. The commission would takepart in the team's budgeting process and insetting performance criteria for the teamand ballpark. The Pohlad family, owners of the Twins, would make a gift of $15 million to helpfinance the stadium and assume all liabilityfor any operating losses of the team. TheTwins also would dedicate $25 million fromthe sale of naming rights and concessionairepayments to help pay for the building. The bill also requires private sector par- ticipation for the deal to go forward. By Dec.31, 1997, at least 80 percent of the privateboxes would have to be sold for a minimum of 10 years. (The existing design calls for 52suites.) At least 80 percent of the club seatswould have to be leased or sold for the open-ing season. (The proposed design calls for4,900 such seats.) And the sale of 22,000season tickets would have to be pledged. Thenew stadium would be slated to be com-pleted in time for the season opener of 2001. Under the bill, the Pohlads could sell their interest in the team to the state for $105million no sooner than five years after thefirst regular home game in the facility. John Pacheco, vice chair of the Metropoli- tan Sports Facilities Commission, presentedthe panel with an analysis of stadium op-tions prepared by his group. \"We concludedthat there is a need for a new ballpark,\"Pacheco said. \"The Metrodome was built asa football stadium. It hasn't worked well forthe Twins financially.\" Before lawmakers could take a swing at voting on a 10-cent-per-pack cigarette tax increase to help pay fora new Twins outdoor baseball stadium, a bill heard March 13 replaced that tax with one on memorabiliaand clothing bearing the logos of professional sports teams. \u2014 Photo-illustration by Andrew Von Bank. \u2014 Stadium painting by Terrence Fogarty, commissioned by Ed Villaume, Minnesotans for Outdoor Baseball.4 SESSION WEEKLY / March 14, 1997 The commission also recommends that the retractable roof be put back on the park,Pacheco said. \"This is not an issue of rich people or poor people,\" said Jim Pohlad, representing theTwins ownership. \"This is about keepingprofessional baseball in Minnesota.\" When questioned by Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley) about any plansto move the team, Pohlad insisted that nosuch plans exist. \"We have not solicited anyproposals.\" Twins President Jerry Bell told the panel that of the 28 teams in Major League Base-ball, the Twins' stadium revenues are theworst. \"The top revenue-generating teamsall have new outdoor ballparks.\" Stadium revenues from parking, suites, signage, concessions, and a strong season-ticket base have become the key growth areasfor sports teams, Bell said. \"In theMetrodome, not only are we last in parkingand suite revenues, we have no parking orsuite revenues.\" he said. Speaking against public funding of the ballpark was Rev. Ricky Rask of St. Paulrepresenting Fund Kids First. \"We believethat when every child in Minnesota has a healthy neighborhood, a solid education, anurturing home, and a good job prospect,then we can attend to new professional sportsfacilities,\" Rask said. Rask contrasted the stadium debate with the current discussion of welfare reform.\"How can we talk about cutting food stampsfor the elderly poor, and then talk aboutproviding a public subsidy to an elderly bil-lionaire?\" she asked in reference to Twinsowner Carl Pohlad. Jon Commers of Fans Advocating iNtelligent Spending also spoke against thelegislation. \"The Minnesota Twins and theMetropolitan Sports Facilities Commissionhave made little effort to explore privatefinancing for a new ballpark,\" he said. Commers also questioned the expected economic benefit claimed for the new sta-dium. \"Entertainment dollars in our area arefinite. If more people go to Twins games,they are not spending their money else-where.\" The committee is expected to vote on the bill next week. \u2014 Steve ComptonFrank Quilici, a former player and manager for the Minnesota Twins, testified in favor of a newoutdoor baseball stadium for the ball club beforethe House Local Government and MetropolitanAffairs Committee March 13.Rev. Ricky Rask, of Fund Kids First, testified against a new outdoor baseball stadium for the MinnesotaTwins before the House Local Government andMetropolitan Affairs Committee March 13. AGRICULTUREOther stadium bills Three other stadium-related bills have been introduced in the House thissession. Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-NewHope), chair of the House Local Gov-ernment and Metropolitan AffairsCommittee and sponsor of the mainstadium bill ( HF1367 ), has said that she does not plan to hear the other billsin her committee. She has indicatedsome openness to incorporating ideasfrom the other bills into her legislation. The other bills: HF107: Rep. Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon) would sell the old Met Cen-ter land in Bloomington and use therevenue to pay off the Metrodome'sdebt. The Vikings would then be of-fered the Metrodome The billalso abolishes the Metropolitan Commission. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) would appropriate $100 million tobuy the Twins. The state would thenseek a new private owner committedto keeping the team in the state. Anynew stadium subsequently builtwould be with private money and taxrevenues derived from the stadium. HF1309: Rep. Mike Jaros (DFL- Duluth) would authorize the Minne-sota State Lottery to create gamesbased on the results of sporting events.Proceeds would go to fund a newstadium. Fairness for farmers The House passed a resolution March 10 asking the federal government to providerelief for Minnesota dairy farmers currentlyfeeling a financial squeeze. The vote was127-2. HF1067 , sponsored by Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls), would require the state tosend a resolution to Congress, the president,and the Department of Agriculture askingfor changes in the federal milk pricing sys-tem. Minnesota dairy farmers in recent months have seen a significant drop in the prices theyget for their products, while the state's con-sumers continue to pay exceptionally highretail prices for milk. Low prices paid to farmers are driving them out of the dairy business, according to5 March 14 , 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWenzel. The state is losing an average of about three dairy operations a day. The proposed resolution calls for an end to a pricing system that is, according to theresolution, \"profoundly unfair and discrimi-natory against Minnesota and Upper Mid-west dairy producers.\" It also requests that Minnesota and neigh- boring states be allowed to form a compactto guarantee dairy farmers a fair minimumprice if a similar compact already formed bynortheastern states is allowed to stand. (See Jan. 31, 1997, SessionWeekly, page 4.) HF1067 now goes to the Senate. CRIME Scab research A proposal to spend $1.6 million to con- tinue research into a plant disease that hascost Minnesota farmers millions was ap-proved March 10 by the House AgricultureCommittee. HF748 , sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy), would provide funds tocontinue the search for scab-resistant variet-ies of wheat and barley. Scab, the common name for Fusarium head blight, began causing problems forMinnesota wheat and barley farmers in theearly 1990s. Estimated losses caused by thedisease from 1993 to 1996 totaled about $1.2billion. \"It has cost us an awful lot of money, and it has cost farmers an awful lot of heartache,\"said Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus), who is co-sponsoring the bill. The state has spent nearly $1.5 million on scab research since 1995. Tunheim's billmatches Gov. Arne Carlson's budget recom-mendation for continued research conductedthrough the University of Minnesota. The bill now moves to the House Environ- ment and Natural Resources Finance Com-mittee. Measuring foul odors The House Agriculture Committee ap- proved a bill March 10 that would providefunding for an effort to measure foul odors. Specifically, the bill ( HF913 ) would pro- vide $400,000 for University of Minnesotaresearchers to create an odor rating systemto compare odors of livestock facilities. The rating system would be used to de- velop property setback requirements and toexamine management practices and tech-nologies used to control livestock odor. Odor problems associated with livestock feedlots and manure lagoons have becomean increasing concern in rural Minnesota, where questions have been raised about thehealth effects of such odors. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls), now moves to the HouseEnvironment and Natural Resources FinanceCommittee. Making notification work The House Judiciary Committee on March 10 approved a series of bills that would refineand strengthen the new Minnesota Com-munity Notification Act. That law autho-rizes local law enforcement agencies todisclose information to the public concern-ing potentially dangerous sex offenders whoare about to be released from prison or atreatment facility. HF541 , sponsored by Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester), is, in part, a response to thefirst Minnesota case in which the commu-nity was notified of a released sexoffender.According to John Curry of the HennepinCounty Attorney's Office, confusion wascaused by the way information about theoffender's criminal history filtered to thepublic in the Eagan, Minn., case. Becausemany of the offender's crimes were commit-ted as a juvenile, authorities were unclearabout which information they could pro-vide. The initial lack of information causedmany to ask why the offender was subject tothe notification law. \"Our office received quite a few calls from people very interested in this offender, butwe were unable to provide all the informa-tion. People were perplexed as to why he wasso dangerous,\" Curry said. HF541 would make it clear that authori- ties have the right to release all informationthat the Department of Corrections (DOC)uses to write its report about an offender,including any offenses committed as a juve-nile. The reports are written upon release toassess an offender's risk level and are sent torelevant law enforcement agencies. Further, HF541 would clarify the process of notification. It would require that a resi-dential treatment facility notify appropriateauthorities within 48 hours of finalizing anoffender's relocation plan, and that thoseauthorities give local law enforcers the infor-mation within five days of receiving the no-tice. The committee also approved HF472, sponsored by Bishop, which appropriates$500,000 from the general fund to help local law enforcement agencies cover the costs ofcommunity notification. In addition to theinitial notification, according to WillAlexander of the DOC, agencies would haveto repeat the process in any community intowhich an offender moves for up to 10 yearsafter being released or placed on probation. The extent of the information and to whom it is provided is determined by the offender'srisk level, which is set by a panel before theperson's release into the community. A LevelI offender's release will cause local law en-forcers, victims and witnesses to be notified.Level II offenders generate notification tothe above, as well as public and private edu-cational institutions, day care facilities, andany other facilities that serve individuals likelyto be victimized by the offender. Level IIIoffenders will cause members of the com-munity whom the offender is likely to en-counter to be notified. In a third bill ( HF95 ), the committee added sex offenders released from federal prisonsto those covered by the notification act. \"When the federal government passed the law [mandating that states develop notifica-tion plans] they left a group out \u2014 their ownprisoners,\" said Rep. Wes Skoglund, (DFL-Mpls), committee chair and the bill's spon-sor. While sex offenders make up a small per- centage of federal inmates, Skoglund pointedout that they can roam freely upon release,without a requirement that authorities in-form communities of their presence. HF95 says the DOC shall collaborate with federal authorities to develop a communitynotification plan regarding sex offenders re-leased from federal prisons who intend tolive in Minnesota. All three bills will be added to an omnibus crime prevention bill to be voted on later thissession. Abetting offenders It may seem a given that aiding, abetting, or harboring a criminal is illegal, but intruth, that's not always the case. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) discov- ered a loophole in the law that preventsauthorities from filing charges against some-one who harbors an offender who is onprobation. Skoglund, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, sponsored a bill ( HF93 ) that specifies helping a felon on supervised re-lease, probation, or parole to avoid or escapearrest is a felony crime with a maximumpenalty of three years in prison and a $5,0006 SESSION WEEKLY / March 14, 1997 fine. The committee approved the bill at its March 12 meeting. While current law makes it a crime to help someone being sought for a felony, it is silentabout abetting a convicted felon on proba-tion who is being sought for suspected pro-bation violations. Violations, for example,could mean failing to keep meetings with aprobation officer; being spotted at a crimescene; flunking a urine test for drug use, orviolating an order prohibiting contact withchildren. Authorities have discovered the hard way that someone can, without penalty, help theoffender elude authorities. \"What a lot of people didn't know is that if a person is on probation or parole and youwant to aid them in eluding authorities, it'snot illegal,\" explained Skoglund. \"They couldbe a murderer or rapist and there's no lawagainst helping them hide.\" HF93 will become part of the omnibus crime bill to be voted on later this session. Janie and Jim Case of St. Joseph, Minn., told members of the House Judiciary Committee's DWISubcommittee March 7 about the 1994 death of their 14-year-old daughter, Lisa, framed picture , caused by a driver whose blood alcohol level was 0.09. They testified in support of a bill that wouldlower the legal blood alcohol limit from 0.10 to 0.08 for adults.Lowering the limitOffenders crossing borders Every state has laws making it a crime to violate court-ordered probation or parole,such as leaving the state without permission.But not every state has a law making it illegalfor the same offender to enter their borders. That may change in Minnesota with HF29 , sponsored by Rep. Wes Skoglund, (DFL-Mpls), which was approved by the HouseJudiciary Committee March 10. The bill would make it a felony, punish- able by up to five years in prison, for anyoneon parole or probation in another state tolive in Minnesota without permission under the interstate compact, an agreement be-tween states regulating the transfer of of-fenders. States have a right to refuse or acceptan offender under the compact. According to the Minnesota Department of Corrections, in 1996, Minnesota accepted871 requests from other states to accept pro-bationers and parolees, and rejected 515.The state sent 648 probationers and paroleesto other states, and 316 requests were re-jected. Most commonly, a request from another state is on behalf of a Minnesota residentwho committed a crime in another state,according to Kent Grandlienard of the De-partment of Corrections. \"They're comingback home,\" he said. Minnesota's border states \u2014 Wisconsin, Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014request the majority of transfers to Minnesota,with Illinois, Texas, and California providinganother sizeable chunk. Those states also re-ceive the most requests from Minnesota. The purpose of the bill, however, is to deal with those offenders who choose not to heedthe decisions of the authorities. The offendermost at issue is the smalltime criminal,Skoglund said. \"If it's a high-level offender,the other state is going to want them backanyway,\" Skoglund said. \"But if it's a low-level offender, the other state may not care.It may be glad to be rid of him.\" The new lawwould give states an additional tool to dealwith those individuals should they re-offendin Minnesota, he added. HF29 will be added to the omnibus crime prevention bill to be voted on later this ses-sion.Calling 911 Two bills that would prohibit interference with attempts to make 911emergency phonecalls were approved March 12 by Housecommittees. HF350 , sponsored by Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights), respondsto a growing concern about domestic abusesituations. Mike Buske, a Plymouth policeofficer, told the House Judiciary Committeethat he has encountered numerous situa-tions in which a woman has been blocked inher effort to call 911 during a violent domes-tic dispute. \"I respond to domestic calls every day,\" Buske said. \"The most important thing avictim can do is call police. The act of anabuser interfering with an attempt for helpshould be penalized. Under current law, theabuser has nothing to lose by stopping theattempt and everything to gain.\" HF350 says that interrupting, disrupting, or otherwise interfering with a 911 call is agross misdemeanor that could result in ayear in jail and a fine of up to $3,000. One of the benefits of the law, said Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), would be toadd the crime to any other offenses of theabuser, which could, down the line, result inmore severe sentencing for future violations. In a related bill, the House Judiciary Committee's Civil and Family Law Divisionapproved HF686 , which would prohibit landlords from discouraging tenants frommaking 911 calls. Under the bill, a landlord could not in- clude a provision in a lease that bars or limitsa tenant's right to call for police or emer-gency assistance and may not penalize a ten-ant for doing so. Bill sponsor Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL- St. Paul) said the problem is growing aslandlords try to stay clear of ordinances thatwould penalize them for having too manypolice visits to their properties. In the mostfrequent scenario, Paymar said, a womanhas been warned by a landlord not to callpolice to respond to domestic abuse. \"Landlords were putting language in their leases that a resident could not call police ifthey were being assaulted, and that it wouldbe grounds for eviction. It puts women in avery dangerous position,\" Paymar said. According to Cass Welsh, of the attorney general's office, the warnings have been inwritten and verbal form. Her office has heardfrom at least 30 women who have been threat-ened with eviction for making the calls, andsome have been evicted, she said. Committee members pointed out that7 March 14 , 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYDEVELOPMENT EDUCATIONSCHOOLwhile prohibiting a tenant from making a 911 call is already illegal, some landlordshave made tenants think they have to followsuch a prohibition, and that the added legis-lation is necessary. HF686 now heads to the House Judiciary Committee. HF350 will be added to the omnibus crime bill to be voted on later thissession. Tax credits for training A bill that would give employers who hire workers from certain job training programsa tax credit was approved by the House Eco-nomic Development Finance DivisionMarch 10. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), would provide $1.7 mil-lion in tax credits over five years. She told committee members that the mea- sure ( HF413 ) should help in the welfare reform effort by training disadvantagedpeople and helping them become self-sufficient. Companies would pay nonprofit job train- ing programs \u2014 such as Minneapolis-basedTwin Cities Rise \u2014 to hire program gradu-ates. In the case of Twin Cities Rise, thecharges would amount to $12,000 to hire thetrained employee and $9,000 per year for upto two years, to retain the employee. Of those amounts, the bill would grant the employer a state tax credit of $8,000 forinitially hiring the worker and $6,000 peryear (for two years) for retaining the worker.The maximum tax credit per employee wouldbe $20,000 which means the bill would pro-vide credits for about 85 employees. The bill also states that the jobs must pay at least $9 per hour in the first year and $10per hour in the second and third year. Rest said that she included in her bill a sunset of the tax credit in 2002 so the pro-gram could be reviewed to find out if itworks. Steve Rothschild, president of Twin Cities Rise, a nonprofit work skills developmentprogram, said the credits would not onlyhelp Minnesota with welfare reform, butprovide the marketplace with skilled work-ers in high-demand areas and the state withmore tax-paying workers. Twin Cities Rise has been in existence for about two years and will place its first em-ployees this year. Rothschild said his organi-zation already has working relationships withemployers and has discussed placement andretention fees in advance.Participants, he said, are trained to work in a variety of high-demand fields such ascomputers, precision machine operation andrepair, and health care services. Division chair Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL- St. Paul) noted that the program seemed\"fairly pricey\" and asked Rothschild wherethe expenses come in. Rothschild explained that the program involves assessing the skills and the needs ofthe participant, identifying job interests andlearning disabilities, teaching basic skills andlanguage classes when necessary, one-on-one coaching with a work skills coach onsuch issues as conflict resolution and per-sonal responsibility, and in some cases, pay-ing for diploma or degree programs at atechnical or community college. He told the committee that everyone is required to work while participating in TwinCities Rise whether that means folding laun-dry or custodial work. Their pay, he added,may also be supplemented by the programuntil the participant is hired in the market-place. Some lawmakers didn't see the wages re- quired under the bill as justified. Rep. Doug Reuter (R-Owatonna) ques- tioned whether the $9-per-hour starting wagewas too high and possibly a way to beginsetting a new, higher minimum wage acrossthe state. \"To me this seriously flaws thisprogram.\" Rep. Michelle Rifenberg (R-La Crescent) agreed. She said her husband hires collegegraduate microbiologists and they earn $9 or$10 per hour. HF413 is now on its way to the House Economic Development and InternationalTrade Committee. No license for truants A bill advancing in the House would allow high school students to maintain drivingprivileges as long as they stay in school. The House Education Committee on March 11 rejected a proposal to require highschool students to pass graduation tests be-fore becoming eligible to receive a driver'slicense. However, the committee approved a bill that would allow the state to suspend thelicenses of 16- and 17-year-old dropouts andtruants. When introduced, HF446 sponsored by Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls), called for driv-ing privileges to be linked to the state's mini-mum standards tests for reading and math. Under the original bill, students under 18 years old would have been required to passthe tests, which are first given in the eighthgrade, in order to be eligible for a driver'slicense. The committee removed the testing re- quirements from the proposal. Biernat of-fered separate amendments to put the testingprovisions back into the bill and to form aworking group to study the issue, but bothamendments were defeated. Opposition to the testing provisions came from several legislators concerned about theimpact such a law would have on studentswho are from low-income families and al-ready struggle at school and at home. Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Park) said the bill would have a more significantimpact on low-income students, especiallythose who depend on driving to get to theirjobs. The bill also drew opposition from stu- dents, parents, teachers unions, and schoolofficials during earlier committee hearings.(See March 7, 1997, Session Weekly , page 7.) Biernat said the testing provisions would provide additional motivation for studentsby tapping into the enthusiasm most youngpeople have for getting a driver's license. As it now stands, the bill would affect only students who are 16 or 17 years old and donot regularly attend classes. The state wouldbe allowed to suspend the license of studentswho withdraw from school, are dismissed,or are habitually truant. Students who are dismissed (suspended or expelled) from school for more than fivedays would have their licenses suspended for30 days for a first-time dismissal and for 90days for each subsequent dismissal. Dropouts and habitual truants would lose their licenses until they turn 18. The bill now moves to the House Trans- portation and Transit Committee. Attracting superintendents A House subcommittee has approved two bills that aim to help school districts attractand retain quality superintendents. HF897 would lift the state's salary cap for school superintendents, and HF937 would double the amount of time districts are al-lowed to keep interim superintendents. Both bills were approved March 13 by the Quality Initiatives Subcommittee of theHouse Education Committee. Current state law caps the salary of school superintendents at 95 percent of thegovernor's salary of $114,506 per year. School8 SESSION WEEKLY / March 14, 1997 districts have complained that the cap hurts their ability to compete with districts in otherstates for top superintendent candidates. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), who is sponsoring HF897 , said the existing salary cap amounts to state \"micro-managing\" ofdecisions that should be made by local schoolboards. \"The intent of this is not to pay superin- tendents huge amounts,\" Greiling said. \"It'sto have local control.\" proposal as \"needed but unpopular,\" Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee) said there is no doubt Minnesotadistricts must compete for superintendentswith those in other states that have no suchsalary limits. \"The pool of experienced urban superin- tendents across the nation is a pretty smallpool,\" Kelso said. Greiling's bill also would allow districts to negotiate superintendent contracts that in-clude required performance results, such asimprovements in student achievement andcurriculum. Bob Meeks, a lobbyist for the Minnesota School Boards Association, said the bill wouldprovide local control and would assist dis-tricts facing an increasingly competitivemarket for qualified superintendents. \"It puts accountability where it should be,\" he said. Meeks also supported HF937 , which would double the current 90-working-daylimit on the tenure of interim superinten-dents and lift a provision in current law thatallows individuals to fill the interim role nomore than three times. Bill sponsor Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL- Crystal) said his proposal would allow dis-tricts more time to search for permanentsuperintendents and would ensure that thebest people are allowed to serve on an in-terim basis. Both bills now move to the full Education Committee.EMPLOYMENTAppliaction Fifteen-month-old Heleen van Evert found thelap of Susan Peterson, St. Paul, a cozy spotduring a rally for Early Childhood and FamilyEducation (ECFE) March 11 in the Capitolrotunda. ECFE is a community-based programthat provides learning experiences for bothparents and their children to promote goodchildhood development. The rally wasintended to heighten legislators' awareness ofthe program's positive impact on life-longlearning and to encourage policymakers tosupport increased funding.ECFE rally Busted for tobacco Teachers would be required to report stu- dents who use, or are suspected of using,tobacco products on school premises, undera bill advancing in the House. HF904 , sponsored by Rep. Peg Larsen (R- Lakeland), was approved March 11 by theHouse Education Committee's Quality Ini-tiatives Subcommittee. The bill would expand current law requir- ing teachers to report students whom theteachers know or have reason to believe areusing or possessing alcohol or controlledsubstances.Also, local law enforcement agencies would be required to report the names of studentswho violate laws governing the use and pos-session of tobacco products. Law enforce-ment is already required to report drug andalcohol violations. \"We think [the bill] sends a message to young people that tobacco violations will bedealt with seriously,\" said SuzAnn Stenso-Velo, a Washington County public healthspecialist who testified in support of the bill. Reports of tobacco use or suspected use would be made to the school's chemicalabuse preassessment team, a group designedto provide intervention for students facingtroubles with alcohol or drugs. Chuck Briscoe, principal of Stillwater Area High School, said the bill would put \"a littleteeth\" in school efforts to combat tobaccouse. Schools have anti-tobacco educationprograms in place, he said, but the numberof violations of tobacco restrictions contin-ues to increase. Officials from teachers unions expressed some reservations about the bill. \"We only have so much time in a day,\" said Cheryl Furrer, a lobbyist for the Minne-sota Education Association. \"Do we want tospend the time reporting on tobacco use or do we want to spend the time planning andworking on strategies that will improvelearning?\" Furrer questioned a provision that would require tobacco use or suspected use to bereported \"immediately,\" and that teacherscould be held liable if they fail to make suchreports. Larsen said she is willing to make changes to the bill to ensure that teachers are not heldliable for failing to make reports related totobacco use. The bill now moves to the House Educa- tion Committee. Minimum wage increase A bill to raise Minnesota's minimum wage won approval from the House Labor-Man-agement Relations Committee March 10. HF892 , sponsored by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia), would raise Minnesota'sminimum wage for large businesses from$4.25 to $5 per hour on April 1, 1997, and to$5.40 on Sept. 1, 1997. For small businesses,the wage would go from $4 to $4.75 on April1 and to $5.15 on Sept. 1. (In both cases,that's 25 cents per hour more than the fed-eral minimum wage which was increasedlast fall.) The threshold separating a large from a small business also would change under thebill, from $362,500 to $500,000 in annualgross sales. This would conform with federaldefinitions for minimum wage purposes. The bill would prohibit employers from paying the reduced wage rate to employeesunder 20 years of age, which is allowed underfederal law. It also lacks provisions for tipcredits contained in the federal law. Underfederal law, tipped employees can be paid aminimum of $2.13 per hour. Beth Hargarten of the Department of La- bor and Industry spoke against the bill. \"Thegovernor would like to see the state lawconform to the federal law,\" she said. \"Thatmeans the same wage rate, same employer'sdefinition, [same] allowance for training,and [same] allowance for a tip credit.\" Tom Newcomb, of the Hotel and Restau- rant Association, spoke against the bill andtold the panel that his organization sup-ported a tip credit amendment sponsored byRep. Hilda Bettermann (R-Brandon). Theamendment, which would have set differentrates for tipped employees, failed. Newcomb said a survey conducted by his9 March 14 , 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYorganization indicated that restaurant serv- ers earn an average of $14 per hour when tipsare included. Jaye Rykunyk of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union, Local 17, challenged thatfigure, which was gathered by asking em-ployers to estimate what they think theiremployees are earning including tips. Rykunyk offered a survey of Local 17's 1,000 members, which is based on copies ofemployee W2 tax forms. \"We came up withan average wage of $7.80 per hour,\" she said.\"We do have a few servers who make verygood wages in very exclusive restaurants, butthey are not the norm.\" Rykunyk also pointed out that Minnesota has not had a tip credit in place for the past10 years and business has not been hurt.\"During that time the [hotel and restaurant]industry has expanded by 27 percent,\" shesaid. HF892 now moves to the House floor. Employee wage protection When a group of restaurant workers in Moorhead, Minn., showed up for work oneMonday morning, they found the doorslocked and an \"out of business\" note await-ing them. They had neither notices nor finalpaychecks from their employer. That inci-dent set in motion a piece of legislation(HF1038 ) that would offer such workers relief. Sponsored by Rep. Kevin Goodno (R- Moorhead), the Employee Wage ProtectionAct would create a special state fund in theDepartment of Economic Security to ensurepayment of employee wages when an em-ployer goes out of business. Employees couldreceive wages for up to four weeks work or$2,000, whichever is less. \"Many of these workers live paycheck to paycheck,\" Goodno told the House Labor-Management Relations Committee, whichapproved the bill March 10. \"This type ofsituation creates a crisis in their lives.\" The Department of Economic Security also would be authorized to sue recalcitrantemployers for amounts paid from the ac-count, plus costs, and a 25-percent penalty.No appropriation to the fund is specified inthe bill at this time. According to Goodno,when money is appropriated, it will be usedto create a revolving fund which can bereplenished with money collected fromemployers. The bill now moves to the Governmental Operations Committee.ENERGY Joe Campbell, a member of the Prairie IslandEnvironmental Protection Committee, testifiedMarch 10 in favor of a bill that would createMinnesota's own nuclear regulatory panel to dealwith nuclear waste storage during a hearing of theHouse Environment and Natural ResourcesCommittee.Nuclear Responsibility Act Minnesota would have its own nuclear regulatory panel under a measure approvedby the House Environment and Natural Re-sources Committee March 10. The Minnesota Nuclear Responsibility Act of 1997 ( HF880 ), sponsored by Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul), would establishthe state's Nuclear Waste Council. The 23-member group, composed of state officials,legislators, and Indian tribal officials wouldbe charged with establishing a process todevelop technically sound transportation andsiting criteria for the storage of high-levelradioactive waste produced in Minnesota. The council also would recommend site criteria for the storage of high-level radioac-tive waste in Minnesota, including compen-sation for residents of the affected area. Itsactivities would be paid for by a special as-sessment to Northern States Power Co. (NSP)customers. Minnesota has two nuclear power plants \u2014 at Prairie Island and Monticello \u2014 thatproduce high-level radioactive waste. Bothare owned and operated by NSP. The issue of where to store nuclear waste and how to safely get it there stems from theactions of the 1994 Legislature, which au-thorized nuclear waste to be stored in drycasks outside the Prairie Island plant. Theadjacent Prairie Island Mdewakanton Siouxcommunity strongly objected to the plan.Largely at issue was how long the waste wouldremain at the site. The Legislature also required NSP to find an alternative storage site in GoodhueCounty. NSP tried, but after protests fromcounty residents, the state's EnvironmentalQuality Board (EQB) halted the alternativesite plan in Oct. 1996, also citing transporta-tion concerns. HF880 would repeal the alternate storage facility requirement of the 1994 legislation,but would make NSP demonstrate to theEQB that the dry casks it is using are capableof being safely unloaded. \"NSP is disappointed and dismayed to see this bill,\" said Cathy Gjermo, a senior engi-neer with NSP. \"We have complied with thestate's alternative siting process which wasstopped by the EQB. That process cost ourrate payers and your constituents $3 million.This new plan also will cost NSP rate payersa lot of money. . . . It is redundant with otherfederal and state agencies and programs.And NSP is dismayed to see that we wouldnot be represented on this council.\"The federal government already has a plan in place to accept waste storage by January1998, Gjermo said. \"We support thatprocess.\" Since 1982, the federal government has been seeking a long-term, high-level radio-active waste storage site. Because no state hasagreed to accept such a facility, no perma-nent site has been announced. \"There is no such thing as a contractual agreement with the federal government,\"said Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls). \"Theycan do whatever they want. We need toadmit that we are stuck with NSP's nuclearwaste and we have to deal with it.\" \"I'm amazed that NSP is not supporting this bill,\" said committee chair Rep. WillardMunger (DFL-Duluth). \"It is in your bestinterest.\" HF880 now moves to the House Regu- lated Industries and Energy Committee. Need to know the House File number or the chief author of a bill? Call the House Index Office at (612) 296-664610 SESSION WEEKLY / March 14, 1997ENVIRONMENTTaxing wind energy The House Regulated Industries and En- ergy Committee approved a bill March 11that would increase the property tax burdenon wind energy facilities. Current law exempts most wind-generat- ing facilities from property taxes in an effortto encourage investment in what was con-sidered a fledgling industry. But Rep. TedWinter (DFL-Fulda), sponsor of HF799 , said that the tax policy encourages the industry atthe expense of the communities in which thefacilities are located \u2014 mostly rural, cash-strapped areas. The measure simply bringsthose facilities into balance with how otherstates tax wind-power plants, Winter said,and with how other energy-producing facili-ties are taxed. The tax could provide thosecommunities with hundreds of thousands ofdollars in badly needed revenue, he said. \"They're some of the poorest counties in the state,\" Winter said. \"The bill reflectsmore of the actual value of the facilities, andallows us to pass the costs to the actual users,just like the rest of the world does.\" (Affectedutility companies would be allowed to re-cover the increases through their rates.) Winter said that rural areas were made to believe that the plants would be a revenueboon. No boon has happened, however, es-pecially compared to the impact other in-dustries, particularly power industries, wouldnormally have. But Rep. Mike Osskopp, (R-Lake City) said that the tax would discourage the use ofthe environmentally friendly energy source.\"If you want to encourage the industry anddiscourage nuclear power, why treat it thesame as nuclear power?\" he asked. Local officials, however, would welcome the added revenue. \"You can add incentives [to build] in other ways,\" said Randy Jorgenson of the South-west Regional Development Commission.\"Exempt corporate income, or sales tax, [forexample]. Incentives don't have to be at theexpense of local government.\" Audrey Zibelman of Northern States Power Co. said her company doesn't neces-sarily own the wind-energy facility on whichit would pay the added taxes and, in contrastto Winter's figures, said Minnesotans al-ready pay more for wind-generated electric-ity than those in other states. The amount that would show up on a customer's bills, however, would be rela-tively small \u2014 about $1 per year \u2014 butwould vary between customers, Zibelmansaid. \"The last thing we want to do is penalizepeople for locating wind generators in Min- nesota,\" she said. \"The bill clearly goes in thewrong direction.\" HF799 would divide the facilities into three categories, each taxed differently. Small-scale wind systems \u2014 those that produce two or less megawatts of energy \u2014would be tax-exempt, as they are under cur-rent law. The bill would allow the foundation and support pads in mid-sized systems \u2014 thoseproducing between two and 12 megawatts ofenergy \u2014 to be taxed at market value, andprotective structures would be taxed at 30percent of their market value. Other equip-ment, such as turbines, blades, and trans-formers, would be exempt. Large-scale wind energy systems would be taxed at 30 percent of market value for all oftheir wind energy conversion property, in-cluding the foundation and support pad,support and protective structures, and re-lated equipment. Large-scale systems pro-duce more than 12 megawatts of energy. The provisions apply to wind energy sys- tems built after Jan. 1, 1991, and would affecttaxes payable in 1998 and thereafter. HF799 heads next to the House Taxes Committee. Mercury emissions regulated Three bills addressing mercury emissions were approved by the House Environment andNatural Resources Committee March 12. Edward Swain, a research scientist with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency(MPCA), explained to members that mer-cury is a potent neurotoxin that can perma-nently damage the nervous systems ofdeveloping fetuses and children. Since mer-cury is an element, it does not degrade in theenvironment. Airborne mercury eventuallyreturns to earth and contaminates the water-shed. It also accumulates in animal tissue asit moves up the food chain, Swain said. Con-sumption of fish from 90 percent ofMinnesota's lakes is currently restricted be-cause of mercury contamination. The Mercury Emissions Consumer Infor- mation Act of 1997 ( HF948 ), sponsored by Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls), would re-quire electricity producers to provide theMPCA with statements of mercury emis-sions from their operations. The disclosuremust be made quarterly for the first year theact is in effect and annually thereafter. Patty Leaf, an environmental scientist forNorthern States Power Co. (NSP), told the panel that providing quarterly emissions datafor all of NSP's plants would be difficult, butthe annual reporting requirement would notbe a problem. The first disclosure deadlinethe bill would set is July 1, 1997. The measure now goes to the House Regu- lated Industries and Energy Committee. A second bill ( HF949 ), also sponsored by Wagenius, adds \"electrical relays and otherelectrical devices\" to a list of products fromwhich mercury must be removed for reuseor recycling prior to disposal. \"When weoriginally passed the bill to regulate mercuryrecycling in products, we left out electricalrelays,\" said Wagenius. The law currently regulates such devices as thermostats and switches, which containmercury. A sample relay containing 40 gramsof mercury was passed around for commit-tee members to examine. \"These relays areshowing up in the waste stream and need tobe included [in the law],\" Wagenius said. HF949 now moves to the House Govern- mental Operations Committee. Mercury testing procedures will be re- laxed for incinerators with a proven trackrecord of low emissions under a third bill.HF742 , sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), requires smokestack testing formercury every three months on new incin-erators. The bill allows incinerator operatorswith emissions below 50 percent of theirpermitted mercury limit for three consecu-tive years to cut back testing to once everythree years. Most mercury in the environ-ment originates from incinerator smoke-stacks. \"The purpose of this bill is to reward supe- rior performance,\" said Peter Torkelson, astaff engineer for the MPCA. HF742 next goes to the Governmental Operations Committee. Steam plant on the move Urged by officials from the University of Minnesota and the city of Minneapolis, theHouse Economic Development and Inter-national Trade Committee approved a billMarch 12 that would provide the schoolwith $6 million to relocate its obsolete steamplant. The university, which now has more than 18 million square feet of buildings to heat,has long sought a solution to its need for amodernized system. The school's Board ofRegents had planned to retrofit the existingplant to meet the demand, calling the ideathe quickest and easiest answer to a problemthat needed an immediate response.11 March 14 , 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYMinneapolis officials, on the other hand, have long coveted the river's east bank sitefor recreational use. During the last session,they asked the Legislature for $34 million tohelp fund the plant's relocation. The newrequest, said HF544 sponsor Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), \"is the result of signifi-cant negotiations that took place over thesummer between the university and the city'speople.\" The state money would become available only after the city and the school secureenough funding to complete the $155 mil-lion relocation. According to documentssupplied by the university, the shortfall standsat more than $40 million \u2014 provided thatHF544 wins final approval from the Legisla- ture \u2014 compared to the cost of updating theexisting plant. Gov. Arne Carlson has already come out in favor of relocating the plant and turningthe riverfront into a recreational area. Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton, though, told the committee that relocatingthe plant would do much more than openthe river's east bank up to recreational uses:It would become an engine of economicdevelopment. \"The city could grow 8,000 jobs in the area,\" Sayles Belton said, \"and the universitywould be able to sell energy to businesses inthe southeast industrial area.\" The city needs the $6 million, she contin- ued, to clean up and deliver the new site tothe university. HF544 now moves to the House Environ- ment and Natural Resources Committee.

Winter lasts a long time in Minnesota, and you can't blame a group of senior citizens ifthey get through it by playing a few cardgames. That was part of the message members of the House Regulated Industries and EnergyCommittee's Subcommittee on Gamblingheard March 12. The subcommittee approved HF613 , sponsored by Rep. Thomas Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul), which classifies some gamesas social skill games, as opposed to gambling.Committee chair Rep. Mike Delmont (DFL-Lexington) said the committee's task was tocreate a bill that allowed the games to con-tinue without expanding gambling law. The games in question \u2014 cribbage, pi- nochle, euchre, gin, 500, whist, and others\u2014 are generally held at VFW posts, Ameri-can Legion halls, Moose and Elk lodges,Knights of Columbus halls, and senior citi-zen centers. Often, a fee is charged for par-ticipation in the games, and the winner orwinners in the games may win part of thedoor fee. Even so, the games are harmlessfun, said a group of proponents from aroundthe state. Money, they said, is not a part of it. That, however, has not kept the games from being reported to the Department ofPublic Safety's Gambling Enforcement Di-vision, which has warned the groups to stop.A group of cardplayers from throughout thestate lobbied the committee to adopt a bill that would allow them to continue. Importantly, said Arnold Groskreutz, a senior citizen from Wells, Minn., the hostorganization does not keep any money. \"Onehundred percent goes back to the players,\"he said. That is one key difference betweentheir games and gambling, he said. Further, the committee was told, the games require skill, unlike gambling, which gener-ally involves chance. \"These are tournaments and are different from gambling,\" said Dot Magnuson, ofWhite Bear Lake. \"People at the games aresenior citizens. They're not spending theirrent money. They're just having fun. Wesenior citizens can't do a lot of things as wellas we used to, but we can play cribbage betterthan ever.\" HF613 says that gambling rules do not apply to tournaments or contests of crib-bage, euchre, pinochle, gin, 500, smear, orwhist, on the condition that the promoter ororganizer of the event receives no share ofthe entry fees, wagers, or winnings. \"I think it's a shame that we're at a point in Minnesota that we have to enact languagelike this at the Legislature,\" said Rep. MarkHolsten (R-Stillwater). Price of Government The House of Representatives adopted a Price of Government resolution March 13containing revenue targets aimed at reduc-ing the financial burden on Minnesota tax-payers over the next four years. Expressed as a percentage, the Price of Government figure shows the maximumamount of personal income to be collectedin taxes and other revenue to pay for stateand local government services. SR7, ap- proved by a 68-64 vote, would cap the tax-payers' contribution at 18.2 percent in 1996and 1997, 17.8 percent in 1998 and 1999, and17.7 in 2000 and 2001. Members approved the numbers, as re- quired by the state's Price of Governmentlaw, after voting down two Republican-ledefforts to lower them. The Legislative Commission on Planning and Fiscal Policy had approved SR7 earlier in the week at its March 11 meeting. Local governments use the price of gov- ernment primarily to determine the size oftheir local levies, Keith Carlson, a Senate taxanalyst, told the commission. In addition,Carlson said, the Legislature can use the12 SESSION WEEKLY / March 14, 1997 HIGHER EDUCATIONfigures to assess the efficacy of tax reform proposals. The ceilings, though, are by no means binding. Indeed, Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Park), who chairs the commis-sion, said March 11 that the percentages inSR7 emerged as a by-product of Gov. Arne Carlson's budget process. \"The fact is, this is just some sort of goal that is non-binding,\" Carruthers said, not-ing that Carlson's forecast. \"A lotchanged between January and February, anda lot will change between now and the end ofthe session.\" Severe weather relief The House passed a revised plan on March 13 to help cities and counties recoup some oftheir weather-related costs from the winterof 1996-1997. The vote was 131-1. Sponsored in the House by Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls), HF100 provides $20 million in grant money to cities, coun-ties, and towns for recent severe weather-related matters. Much of the appropriationswould be matched by federal emergencyfunds. The state funds will be divided into three parts: $6 million to the 54 Minnesota coun-ties declared disaster areas; $11 million di-vided between all counties; and $3 million tohelp pay for anticipated spring floods. An additional $16 million has been ear- marked for road repairs by the Departmentof Transportation, plus $95,000 for over-time costs for state troopers. The bill was criticized by some members for offering too little in relief, especially forfloods, but Wenzel said the committees thathandled the bill fought hard to target themoney where it would be needed most. HF100 now awaits the governor's signa- ture. Aid for college students The House Education Committee's Higher Education Finance Division heard two billson March 12 that would substantially in-crease financial aid to low- and middle-in-come college students. The formula prescribed in HF1194 , spon- sored by Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crys-tal), would result in maximum combinedgrants of more than $8,000 for the pooreststudents compared to about $6,000 now. A central element of Carlson's bill would sepa-rate state aid from federal aid, or Pell Grants.Currently, having a Pell Grant award resultsin lowering the amount of a state grant. \"It's clear we need to improve financial aid and access to low-income students,\"Carlson said. The bill also would change the way state grants are calculated by excluding $25,000 insavings and other family assets when deter-mining grant eligibility. Overall, state financial aid would increase by $44 million over current levels, makingaid possible for an additional 2,000 students.It also would protect current recipients fromlosing award money, Carlson said, simplifythe financial aid process, and offer the maxi-mum \"bang for the buck\" \"Student debt has skyrocketed in recent years,\" said Brent Glass, of the MinnesotaState University Students Association, whospoke in favor of Carlson's bill. \" HF1194 will help tens of thousands of students whoneed aid.\" A proposal by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL- St. Paul) would help students by reducingtheir share of attendance costs from 50 per-cent to 40 percent. HF671 also requires that grant recipients get first shot at work-studyjobs and would expand the number of jobsavailable. \"I'm particularly concerned as aSt. Paul legislator that students are having toborrow more and receive less in grants,\"Entenza said. Recent years have seen a dropof 20 percent in enrollment by low-incomestudents, he added. Entenza's bill would increase financial aid by $89 million over current levels in fiscalyears 1998 and 1999, and another $50 mil- Tuition rallyINSURANCEINSURANCE Susan Schiro, lower right , and Lori Wortman, along with other public college and university students, rallied for lower tuition March 12 on the State Capitol steps.lion to boost work study programs. It wouldprovide a maximum award of $7,700 perstudent in addition to expanding work-studyopportunities. This session, the Higher Education Divi- sion has discussed at length the need toimprove access to higher education for mi-nority and low-income students, who arebelieved to comprise the fastest growingpopulation in the state, especially within theTwin Cities. The amount of money available for finan- cial aid in the coming biennium has not yetbeen determined. The committee's financialaid plan will be included in an omnibushigher education package to be voted onlater this session. Managing managed care When Dianne Shea's husband died in March 1993, the official cause of death was aheart attack. But, she said, other factors un-known to her at the time played a role in herfamily's tragedy. Shea's 40-year-old husband, Patrick, had been aware of his family's history of heartdisease and was concerned about warningsigns such as shortness of breath and dizzi-ness. What kept Mr. Shea from receiving the medical care he needed was a financial ar-rangement between the Health MaintenanceOrganization (HMO) in which the familywas enrolled and the family's doctor, ac-cording to Mrs. Shea. \"They saved the cost of bypass surgery at the expense of Pat's life,\" she said. \"The13 March 14 , 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYdoctors, the clinic, and the HMO all made more money because of Pat's death.\" Shea, who is now involved in a court battle with her husband's doctors and the HMO,testified in support of a bill that would re-quire health insurers to disclose to enrolleesany financial agreement that gives the doc-tor an incentive to restrict care. The bill ( HF924 ), sponsored by Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka), was one of twoproposals approved March 12 by the HouseFinancial Institutions and Insurance Com-mittee. Both measures aim to provide newprotection for managed care consumers. Abrams' bill is focused on the disclosure of arrangements between doctors and insur-ance companies. It would require that allhealth plan enrollees receive an annual state-ment of all financial arrangements that pro-vide incentives to minimize care. \"I believe this is an important first step,\" Abrams said. \"Hopefully, we will get better-educated consumers out of it.\" Shea told members of the committee that things might have been different for herhusband if they were aware of the arrange-ments that existed between his doctor andthe HMO. \"Had Pat and I known this conflict of interest existed, our course of action wouldhave been very different,\" she said. \"Wewould have been able to understand that ourphysician was influenced by his own finan-cial outcome, and with that knowledge, wewould have had the opportunity to makeother health care choices that would havesaved Pat's life.\" The same disclosure requirements are in- LOCAL GOVERNMENT OUTSTATEDianne Shea, who told members of the House Financial Institutions and Insurance Committee March 12that her husband suffered a fatal heart attack as the result of undiagnosed heart disease, listened as LoisWattman, of Allina Health Systems, testified against a bill that would require health insurers to discloseto enrollees any financial agreement that gives the doctor an incentive to restrict care. cluded in a separate bill ( HF929 ) that also would set up a variety of new requirementsdesigned to protect patients. Sponsored by Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL- Mpls), the bill would forbid managed careproviders from having so-called gag rules toprevent doctors from talking with patientsabout their medical coverage and any incen-tives created by the health plan company tominimize care. Orfield's bill also would require health insurance companies and HMOs to haveinternal appeal procedures to handle patientcomplaints and would set time limits forinsurers to respond to patient appeals. An alternative dispute resolution process would be created to handle disputes betweenthe insurer and patients that cannot be re-solved internally. The bill calls for a state-wide program, including a toll-free telephoneline to field complaints, to be established tohelp consumers. Other provisions in Orfield's bill would ensure that an enrollee's care from a specificdoctor is not interrupted by a change in thehealth plan's network and would ensure thatenrollees with certain medical conditionshave standing referrals to specialists. HF929 now moves to the House Govern- mental Operations Committee. HF924 goes to the House floor.Encouraging innovation Local units of government would be en- couraged to find more efficient ways to pro-vide services under a bill approved by theHouse Local Government and MetropolitanAffairs Committee March 12. The bill ( HF685 ), sponsored by commit- tee chair Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope),would establish the Local Innovation andEfficiency Program (LIEP) under the Boardof Government Innovation and Coopera-tion. The bill would appropriate $25 millioneach year for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. Local governments could apply to the board for grants of up to $75,000 per year tofund innovation and efficiency programs.The funds could be used for any cost-savinginitiative, including combining local servicessuch as water, sewer, garbage pickup, 911-response, law enforcement, fire fighters,ambulance services, or new ways of collect-ing local utility bills or property taxes. \"This [LIEP] could create economies of scale that would save the taxpayers millionsin the long run,\" said Hennepin CountyCommissioner Peter McLaughlin. The As-sociation of Minnesota Counties initiatedand supports the bill, McLaughlin said. Rep. Kevin Knight (R-Bloomington) asked, \"If it is in their interest, shouldn'tlocal governments already be doing this [in-novation]?\" \"Yes, but unfortunately they don't do it,\" replied Rest. Rep. Steve Dehler (R-St. Joseph) offered an amendment to change the word \"collabo-rate,\" which appears several times in thelegislation, to \"cooperate.\" The amendmentpassed. The bill now moves to the Taxes Committee. Cheaper phone calls The House approved a bill March 13 that aims to help residents of large rural Minne-sota school districts cut down on costly tele-phone bills. The vote was 126-4. The trend of combining rural school dis- tricts has resulted in at least one unforeseenproblem. By blending areas with differenttelephone exchanges, students often meetfriends who require a long-distance tele-phone call to reach.14 SESSION WEEKLY / March 14, 1997 TAXES $Calling the school can mean long-distance charges for parents, and vice versa, even overdistances of just a few miles. The effect isburdensome phone bills for some ruralschool districts and many of their residents. HF211 , sponsored by Rep. Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon), would make it easier for rural commu-nities to eliminate such long-distance costs. The bill would change the way customers within a school district can petition the Pub-lic Utilities Commission to install extendedarea service (EAS), which would expand lo-cal exchanges and eliminate the long-dis-tance charges. Its most important provision would elimi- nate a requirement that at least half of thecustomers make at least three phone calls permonth to exchanges outside of their own toqualify for EAS service, Sviggum said. Schooldistrict residents would need to vote on thephone service change, and at least 10 percentof the customers in each affected phone ex-change must live within the combined schooldistrict. (See March 7, 1997, Session Weekly , page 13) HF211 now goes to the Senate. State rebate for education Families who set aside money for their children's or grandchildren's college educa-tion would see a 15 percent annual matchfrom the state, up to $300, under a proposalfrom Gov. Arne Carlson. It is expected to be introduced as a second component to the governor's education in-vestment fund plan, perhaps as an amend-ment to his tax bill currently before theLegislature. Department of Revenue spokesman John Haugen unveiled the proposal March 11before the House Taxes Committee. Specifi-cally, he outlined HF716 , which contains Carlson's tax initiatives for the next bien-nium. \"This was thought to be a viable option to what was called Edvest One,\" Haugen said,explaining that the new state matching dol-lars proposal would be more attractive tosome investors because deposits in the ac-counts would be tax-free and withdrawalscould be made in the child's name \u2014 andmost likely, at a lower tax bracket \u2014 ratherthan the parents', effectively lowering therate. Edvest One, as Haugen called it, works something like an Individual RetirementAccount. Parents or grandparents could savemoney for a child's higher education anddeduct the deposits from their Minnesota taxable income, although they would still besubject to the federal assessment. Ideally, Haugen continued, the two pro- grams would run concurrently and provideMinnesota parents with even greater choiceswhen it comes to covering the soaring cost ofhigher education. When members of the committee pressed Haugen about some of Edvest's details, headmitted that the program would primarilybenefit those in the upper income brackets. \"A lot of the savings would be going to people with incomes over $100,000 a year,\"Haugen said, \"because they're the ones withthe wherewithal to save.\" According to estimates provided by the rev- enue department, HF716 would cost the state almost $420 million over the next four years:$220 million in the coming biennium andnearly $200 million in the following. The Edvestinitiative would receive nearly $67 million ofthe total during the two biennia. Carlson's education credit and deduction proposals claim the majority of the bill'sfunding \u2014 an estimated $316 millionthrough 2001. A tuition and tutoring credit would allow a dollar-for-dollar individual income taxcredit for fees paid to a private school, tutors,summer schools, or other classes that meetcriteria defined by the state. This credit wouldbe limited to households with income lessthan $39,000 per year and to $1,000 per childor $2,000 per family. The deduction allowed for school-age de- pendents also would rise, from $650 to $1,950for K-6 students and from $1,000 to $3,000for those in grades 7-12. Parents could also Bonus signing Kirby Puckett and Rep. Ann H. Rest, chief author of the stadium bill, share a light moment as theformer Twins hero signs 8-year-old Dillon DeBoer's baseball card prior to a stadium briefing forHouse members March 12.TRANSPORTATION Safer school buses The state would spend $10 million to im- prove safety on school buses, under a billapproved March 12 by the House Transpor-tation and Transit Committee. HF330 , sponsored by Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Center), would providegrant funding for school districts to hireadult school bus monitors, install video cam-eras inside buses, or install strobe lights onbuses. \"It is our responsibility to ensure that each child's school day starts and ends in a safeenvironment,\" Luther said. \"By providingfor their safety, we provide for our future.\" Luther buttressed her case with statistics: During the 1995-96 school year, there weremore than 1,000 accidents involving schoolbuses in Minnesota. More than 240 childrenwere injured in the accidents and five werekilled, according to Luther. Bob Wakanabo, who lost his daughter to a 1985 school bus accident, also testified insupport of the bill. Now a member of thestate's School Bus Safety Advisory Commit-tee, Wakanabo led a successful effort to putadult safety monitors on buses serving aschool on the Leech Lake Reservation. He said adult monitors improve bus safety by working as a team with bus drivers. To-gether, they are better able to control kidsinside the bus, reduce distractions for driv-deduct the cost of tutors, summer school, home computers, and educational software. Further discussion on HF716 is expected.15 March 14 , 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY ers, and watch out for children getting on or off the bus. \"I don't want to see another parent go through the loss of their kid,\" Wakanabosaid. \"These are not accidents. These are buskillings. They could be prevented.\" Under the bill, $6.5 million in grants would help school districts to hire adult safety moni-tors. Districts would be eligible for $4,000annually for each monitor they hire. Monitors at least 18 years old would have to clear a criminal background check and betrained in school bus regulations and meth-ods to ensure safety. Another $3 million in grants would pay for the installation of video cameras andvideo camera boxes on school buses. Cam-eras are considered an effective method ofcontrolling student behavior on buses. Finally, $500,000 in grants would help districts install exterior strobe lights, whichare touted for their ability to improve thevisibility of school buses when they arestopped to let children on or off. Members deleted a section of the bill that called for lap and shoulder safety belts to beinstalled on school buses beginning in 1998.Concerns were raised about the availabilityof seat-belt-equipped buses and the practi-cality of such a requirement. The bill now moves to the House Educa- tion Committee.Leslie Thompson, a sixth-grade school bus patrolofficer at Gordon Bailey Elementary School inWoodbury, told the House Transportation andTransit Committee March 12 about the unrulybehavior on the bus that she rides to school. Thecommittee heard a bill that would provide adultmonitors and video cameras on school buses.Legislative Coordinating Commission(LCC) 85 State Office Building296-1121 LCC Central Accounting 60 State Office Building296-8890 Claims (Joint Subcommittee onClaims) 55 State Office Building 296-0099 Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Oversight Office/Subcommittee 85 State Office Building296-0098 Legislative Advisory Commission(LAC) Fourth Floor, Centennial Office Building658 Cedar St., St. Paul 55155296-4207 Audit Commission/Office ofLegislative Auditor First Floor, Centennial Office Building658 Cedar St., St. Paul 55155296-4708 Legislative Commission on theEconomic Status of Women 85 State Office Building296-8590Toll-free number 1-800-657-3949 Joint Subcommittee on Employee Relations 85 State Office Building296-2963 Legislative Commission onHealth Care Access 375 State Office Building296-0173 * G-9 Capitol 296-4261 *Legislative Commissions Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCMR) 65 State Office Building 296-2406 Legislative Commission on Pensions & Retirement 55 State Office Building296-2750 Legislative Commission onPlanning & Fiscal Policy 463 State Office Building296-4936 Iron Range Resources &Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB) P.O.

Hum-phrey Metrodome are haunting the StateCapitol. As Yogi Berra once said, \"It's likedeja vu all over again.\" In 1971, the Minneapolis City Council first considered a plan for a 70,000-seat down-town stadium requested by the MinnesotaVikings. That proposal started a decade-long process that culminated with the open-ing of the Metrodome in 1982. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Vi- kings and the Twins both played inBloomington's Metropolitan Stadium. TheMet was originally built in 1955 as a homefor the Minneapolis Millers minor leagueteam. It was expanded for the MinnesotaVikings in 1961 and again in 1965 for theTwins. The 48,700-seat Met was one of smallest and most antiquated sports arenas in profes-sional athletics. Sightlines for football werepoor. End zone bleachers were a makeshiftconstruction of blocks and girders. Minne-sota weather could make outdoor playingconditions range from mildly unpleasant tototally unbearable for both players and fans.The Vikings had to practice in a variety ofsmall pastures and public playgrounds. Andmost importantly, neither the Vikings northeir NFL opponents were happy with thesmall profits the Met games generated. The team that had taken the state to within bragging distance of a Super Bowl champi-onship felt it deserved to play in a first-classarena. The Vikings threatened to leave Min-nesota unless they got a new covered stadium. Yet the Met was a popular stadium among fans. Its surrounding asphalt prairies pro-Metrodome history . . . Pre-stadium debates ample space for pregame tailgatingand postgame celebrating. City officials and business leaders believed that a domed stadium in Minneapolis wouldbring more customers to downtown restau-rants, bars, and hotels while ensuring thatprofessional sports remained in the state.Former Minneapolis Chamber of Commercepresident Harvey Mackay summed up thebusiness community's position when he de-clared: \"If the Vikings and the Twins were toleave the Twin Cities, we'd be well on ourway to becoming a frozen Omaha.\" Many state residents were unconcerned by the possible departure of the Vikings.Polls showed that the majority of voters ada-mantly opposed public financing for a newstadium. In addition, business and commu-nity leaders from Bloomington and St. Paul were opposed to the downtown Minneapo-lis site. In 1972, the Minneapolis City Council approved a stadium plan and began arrang-ing to borrow money. Minneapolis MayorCharles Stenvig, who privately supportedthe stadium, vetoed the measure in a bow topublic opinion, assuming that the councilwould override his veto. Grassroots organiz-ers in Minneapolis collected enough peti-tion signatures to force a vote on a new citycharter amendment requiring that the cityhold a referendum for any project costingmore than $15 million. The measure passedin June 1973. The dome's prospects in Min-neapolis had effectively been killed. Stadium proponents were persistent, how- ever, and in 1975, their efforts switched tothe Legislature. Proposals ranged from ex-panding the University of Minnesota's Me-morial Stadium into a $28 million open-airfootball structure to a $126 million multi-purpose dome. There was even a proposal tobuild a recessed \"earth\" stadium in Lakeville. The fear of losing either major sports fran- chise was a big concern for many legislators.In April 1975, the Senate's Metropolitan andUrban Affairs Committee decided that some-thing had to be done to keep the Twins andVikings in Minnesota. In 1976, the JointHouse-Senate Subcommittee on Sports Fa-cilities concluded that remodelingBloomington's Met or the University ofMinnesota's Memorial Stadium would costmore than building a multipurpose stadium. As the stadium issue worked its way through both legislative houses, financingand location became key issues. Manyoutstate legislators resented a proposed ho- Full of hot air One of the more imaginative alterna- tives to the Metrodome was proposedin 1977 by a firm calling itself NewJerusalem Life Style and Air MattressCompany. At a time when the cities ofMinneapolis and Bloomington had siteproposals in play, this company claimedit could solve the problem with a por-table, inflatable arena. Football fanscould watch the first half of a Vikingsgame in Minneapolis, then deflate thestadium, load it on a truck, and move toBloomington for the second half. If theVikings made good on their threat toleave Minnesota, they could take thestadium with them. \"We're as serious asthe rest of the developers who havesubmitted proposals,\" said companyofficial Peter Kramer. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, both the Vikings and the Twins played in Bloomington's Metropolitan Stadium.17 March 14 , 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYTwins win two World Series championships shortly before asking for a new stadium.

South suburban legislators didn'twant their constituents paying a tax to sup-port a Minneapolis stadium. And Minne-apolis and St. Paul legislators had their ownrivalries. At one point early in the stadiumcontroversy, someone proposed building astadium with one goal line in Minneapolisand the other in St. Paul, to be fair to bothcities. That plan never developed. But a bill specifying no site for a 65,000- seat stadium did prevail and was signed intolaw by Gov. Rudy Perpich in May 1977. Thatsame year, a hotel-motel liquor tax was lev-ied over the seven-county metro area tofinance the stadium. In 1978, however, the law, which would have created public debt, was ruled uncon-stitutional by a district judge because it wasn'tpassed by 60 percent of both houses. The 2-percent liquor tax in the bill also was ruledunconstitutional. But once again, the setback didn't kill the issue. A year and much political wranglinglater, Gov. Al Quie signed a bill for a $55million domed stadium in Minneapolis tobe financed, in part, through a more limitedhotel-motel and liquor tax, local businessdonations, and revenues from a special tax district surrounding the dome site. Despite more legal challenges, continued criticism from citizen groups like Minneso-tans Against the Downtown Dome, and evena collapsed roof, the Metrodome was fin-ished for the Twins' home opener in 1982.The 65,000-seat facility was the last two-sport stadium built in the United States. From the beginning, the Metrodome was criticized by baseball teams and fans alike.The Twins tried to schedule all Saturdaygames for the evenings because the dometended to heat up on sunny summer after-noons. Chicago Tribune writer John Margolis described the stadium as \"an abomination,an affront to taste, humanity, culture,America, and who knows, maybe even thegods.\" The dome's environmental quirks,including lighting, turf, and air patterns weresaid to wreak havoc on the game of baseball.After the New York Yankees lost severalgames to the Twins in the dome, Yankeesmanager Billy Martin declared: \"The parkshould be banned from baseball.\" This year the Minnesota Legislature may do just that. \u2014Steve ComptonIt's a fact! In recent years, both federal and state governments have made lifemore spartan and trying for prison-ers. Growing public discontent hasled to cable television blackouts, aresurgence in chain gangs, and cuts inprison programming. In 1994, Con-gress declared inmates ineligible foreducational Pell Grants. Minnesotalawmakers made prisons smoke-freewith a 1996 law. But those behind bars didn't al- ways face such conditions, particu-larly inmates with ample means. One such example is the Marquis de Sade, whose outrageous and devi-ant behavior landed him in thehoosegow for much of the late 18thcentury. In 1784, de Sade was held in the Bastille, where on March 8 he com-plained to his wife that the conditionswere \"much worse than atVincennes,\" where he previously hadbeen held on numerous occasions. Hard to imagine, since the latest issue of the New Yorker tells us de Sade was permitted to bring his own\"furniture, tapestries, and family por-traits to his cell.\" In December of the same year, he also requested a list of \"needed items\"including: \"Twelve raven's quill . . .A hair rib-bon and a ponytail ribbon. A pot ofbeef marrow and a loaf of the same.\" No word on whether de Sade was an avid weightlifter when not primp-ing his ponytail.

Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar) has doneeverything but farm. He grew up in the agri-cultural community of Wells, Minn., and remembers the first timehe drove a tractor at ageeight. He studied soilscience at the Univer-sity of Minnesota. Later,he sold fertilizer andagricultural chemicalsfor the ConAgra Com-pany. Today, he serves on the House Agriculture Committee. \"I'ma frustrated farmer,\" Juhnke said. \"I've al-ways been involved in agriculture. I justwasn't born on a farm.\" At the Legislature, however, he has quickly become associated with a separate cause:\"I'm 'Mr. Road,'\" he said. That's becausehe's working to have a stretch of Highway 23between Willmar and St. Cloud expandedfrom a two-lane to a four-lane road to im-prove the travel route to the Twin Cities andfacilitate the area's growth. \"Willmar is oneof the fastest-growing areas in Minnesota,\"Juhnke said. \"This is one of my front-burnerissues. Overall funding in west-central Min-nesota has been behind for about 60 years.\" Juhnke also identifies with small-business people. With a background in real estate, heruns a business conducting appraisals onfarms and commercial properties from hisoffice, which is in a building he owns inNew members . . . Juhnke paves prosperity downtown Willmar. \"I understand whatsmall businesses go through with the rulesand regulations and personnel,\" he said.\"Rural Minnesota is basically small busi-ness. Overall, the climate is good, but there'salways room for improvement.\" Ideally, hesaid, that means maintaining a balance be-tween free enterprise and regulation. \"Gov-ernment shouldn't be too intrusive or makeit too hard to do business.\" Juhnke said others may not be aware of another growing problem some rural com-munities face \u2014 that of juvenile crime. \"It'sthree or four times what it was not long ago.We need to find out why.\" Juhnke said hethinks one explanation is a \"too-lenient\"judicial system. \"I've seen kids get in troubleand then not see a judge for six or eightmonths. Then, they get slapped on the wrist.Kids used to have more fear of being caughtand punished,\" he said. Juhnke's position in the Legislature isn't his first encounter with elective politics. Hehas served as a Dovre Township precinctchair and executive board member forKandiyohi County. As a newcomer to the Legislature, he's struck by how issues are thoroughly debated.\"It's a very slow, deliberative process, whichis good. It's part of our democracy. But Ithink people tend to think everything getsshoved through,\" he said. When Juhnke isn't occupied with legisla- tive acts, he may be found just acting. He's along-term member of the Barn Theatre in Willmar. \"I'm hoping to get back to it thissummer. Willmar is great for communitytheater.\" Or, he may be found at home participat- ing in another favorite activity: music. \"I likeall kinds of music. I play guitar and trom-bone,\" he said. \"I'm also into your basic '70srock and roll.\" Both avocations may be in-herited: Juhnke's father was a vocal musicinstructor and his mother teaches art andplays the organ in church. Juhnke's home,which he shares with his wife, Claire, a com-mercial artist, and children, Zachary,13, andShannon, 9, is north of Willmar in DovreTownship. \"My dad always told me I had the ability to lead,\" Juhnke said. \"He told me to be carefuland keep moving in the right direction. I'vealways kept that in mind.\" \u2014 Celeste That encompasses everything \u2014 education, roads,airports, housing. That's the concern in my areaas well as throughout greater Minnesota.\" \u2014Rep. Al JuhnkeRep. Al Juhnke Photo courtesy Minnesota Department of AdministrationDo you know? Less than a block from the State Capi- tol, at 117 University Avenue, standsa red brick structure called the FordBuilding. It once housed the Minnesota Law Library and is now home to Minnesota'sBookstore, where one can purchase a setof Minnesota Statutes for $185 or a bread board in the shape of a loon for just$18.95. In the 1930s, the building was a\"place where families went to view andbuy the car of multitudes, the Ford,\"according to the Department ofAdministration's World Wide Web site.Emblazoned across the top of the build-ing, which faces University Avenue, was the familiar Ford script still found on thecompany's logo. The bookstore was established in 1957 to provide State of Minnesota agencieswith a centralized service for the sale anddistribution of agency-produced pub- lications. It receives no funding fromthe Legislature. After Ford pulled out and before the bookstore moved in, the building issaid to have housed a bar in the base-ment and served as a dog pound as well.

The Ford Building circa 1930.19 March 14 , 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) grew up surrounded by DFL politics. It wasthe party of choice for the great majority ofhis East St. Paul neighbors, he said. His uncle, a DFL activist and unionorganizer, is one whomKielkucki attributeswith planting the seedsof his own interest inpolitics. \"My family members were very politically vo-cal and always put theirconvictions into prac- tice. They were steeped in the DFL,\" he said. Yet Kielkucki comes to the House of Rep- resentatives as a Republican and a conserva-tive. \"I changed parties when I felt the partyleft me,\" he said. The decision came during a county con- vention in the 1980s. \"I made some sugges-tions at the meeting, and someone respondedthat I sounded more like a Republican \u2014and said that I should join them. So I did.\" It wasn't the only time Kielkucki followed his convictions. He spent almost 11 years asa seminary student studying to be a priestbefore opting for civilian life. \"I knew I'dalways be committed to working with thechurch,\" he said. \"But I wasn't sure aboutthe priesthood all the way through. I keptgiving it another year.\" Instead, he's given 22 years to teaching, most of them at Holy Trinity High School inWinsted, Minn., where he teaches juniorand senior high and chairs the religious stud-New members . . . Kielkucki examines issues through a moral lens ies program. He was attracted to the par-ish years ago because it offered a K-12educational program for his children, whoare now 20, 16, and 12. His children, aswell as his students, are accustomed to hisfrequent reminders that you have to getinvolved if you want to make change. It'spart of the lesson he teaches in a class inwhich social issues are examined througha moral lens. \"The kids gave me a bit of ahard time. They said I should put mymoney where my mouth is.\" Before running for the Legislature, Kielkucki was an active participant in pre-cinct caucuses and the campaigns of oth-ers. Today, Kielkucki has five areas where he'd most like to have an influence as alegislator, his pro-life stance being fore-most. He's also concerned about education. \"I think the whole approach in the publicschools needs change.\" Teachers no longerare free to adequately discipline students,he said. The students know they can getaway with poor behavior, and the learningenvironment is destroyed. Kielkucki thinksthe system in the United States could learnfrom that in Europe, where, he said, thereis a greater emphasis on basics and less onextracurricular activities. Next comes welfare reform. Kielkucki would add work requirements and timelimits. \"We don't want to hurt the peoplewho need it, but we've been enabling toomany for too long.\"On the crime issue, Kielkucki would focus on juveniles and swift penalties for breakingthe law. \"There should be consequences thefirst time someone steals a car, not thefourth.\" Finally, there's tax reform: \"We're taxed too much, period.\" Kielkucki added that his teaching back- ground is helping him in his new role. \"Thereading, lesson plans, workshops, term pa-pers, and learning to digest what's important\u2014 it's all the same learning model . . . Today,my job is to listen, digest, for waysto address needs,\" Kielkucki said. \"In 10years, what I hope they say about me is thatI'm honest, I listen, and that I effectivelywork for change.\" \u2014 Celeste Riley District 20B 1996 Minnesota Top concern: \"The number one thing my constituents have requested is property taxrelief.

NOTES Gov. Arne Carlson has outlined his vi- sion for some of the state's estimated $2.3billion surplus in his property tax reformproposal, which has yet to be introduced inthe House. Along with a plan to overhaul Minnesota's convoluted tax code, the governor also wrotein a one-time rebate to individual incometaxpayers based on their 1996 returns. Any-one who paid any Minnesota income tax atall in 1996 would get a check for 22 percentof the total, said Department of RevenueCommissioner Jim Girard. The measure specifies a minimum pay- ment of $50 and a maximum of $900 perindividual or $1,800 for a couple. Girardestimated that the rebates would chew uparound $750 million of the surplus. During the course of debate over pro- posed changes to the state's body of un-claimed property law March 13, somemembers of the House Commerce and In-ternational Affairs Committee became deeplyconcerned about how the legislation mightaffect retailers who sell gift certificates thatgo unused. After more than hour of dis-course centering around some of the law'smore arcane provisions, some representa-tives \u2014 particularly those without the ben-efit of a law degree \u2014 expressed frustrationas they tried to glean the nuances of differ-ence that exist between some of the legalconcepts cited in the bill. Indeed, Rep. Ron Erhardt (R-Edina) ap- parently spoke for more than one memberwhen he said, \"Mr. Chair, I'm still unsure asto what the hell we're talking about here!\" The members voted to send the bill to the House Ways and Means Committee.MINNESOTA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE 175 STATE OFFICE BUILDING ST.

It is an integral part of the legislative process because it can control how groups respond to a given agenda.A caucus is the coming together of like factions to develop a plan of action. It may alsobe two or more people discussing a specific topic or participating in a like interest.Most always, a caucus is organized to insure that individuals involved be united for oragainst an issue. Key caucus meetings here in a legislature setting are comprised of political party members who form a majority caucus and a minority caucus. They meet separatelyand in private. Both caucuses work to present a united front during floor debate andfor final voting. Their goals are to demonstrate a desire for making laws they feel willbe in the best interest of the people. Another group, the open caucus visitors and their overheard conversations, are more interesting and educational to the impartial observer. All over, you will findsmall and large collections of individuals conferring or caucusing. For the sake ofrecognition, these groups are hereby identified as one-day-only types and the dailytypes. Sometimes the one-day types can be identified by their body language. They are the ones who get jittery when riding in an elevator. Another method of identity is by what they say. If you overhear someone in the House chamber gallery note that this largest room in the Capitol \"could hold a wholelot of corn,\" it's obvious how to type them. These visitors are here only briefly to showsupport for or oppose some cause. Most of their caucusing involves debate on how tofind a hearing room, the cafeteria, or where to find the tunnel to get to other buildings. One-day types are not to be confused with the special interest faction who show up every day. One-day visitors run in packs of eight to 15 or more and don't walk as fastas the daily guests. The dailies form cliques of only one to four and do most of theircaucusing through a mouth/earpiece device with some unknown group miles away. The most unique group of all is the open air caucus. This caucus is unorganized and made up of individuals from both political caucuses, nonpartisans, and others whohappen by. The meetings seem to provide the most in-depth forum on issues, bills,hearings, the weather, gossip, and all other daily activities. As a caucus, they do notinfluence laws. But maybe because they represent all caucuses and meet out in the freshair, their profound and objective discussions probably affect more opinion then theheavy debate in heated, closed sessions. An obvious, ongoing tactic at the Capitol is \"When in doubt, caucus. \" \u2014 LeClair G. Lambert3 March 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . March 13 - 20, 1997 Highlights \"Fragile, misunderstood, and hopeful\" is the way one leader described the currentstate of Indian affairs at a historic March 19meeting at the State Capitol. Representatives from the state's 11 bands were invited by Sen. Roger Moe (DFL-Erskine) to address a joint meeting of theHouse and Senate local government com-mittees. It was believed to be the first suchmeeting in recent history between state andtribal officials. House committee chair Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) said that legislators feltthe exchange was overdue. No one seemedto disagree. The meeting was not meant towork on bills, but to provide the tribes witha forum for dialogue, said Sen. JimVickerman (DFL-Tracy), chair of the Senatecommittee. Peter Defoe, secretary-treasurer of the Fond du Lac Reservation, said he'd like to seesuch meetings take place regularly. \"It's anopportunity to make our presence knownand help the elected people of the state get toknow us better.\" After all, he added, \"We'rehere, we're not going anywhere, and neitherare they.\" Further, Defoe said a lack of communica- tion makes divisions between tribes and thestate government look bigger than they are. In fact, said Bobby Whitefeather, chair of the Red Lake Nation, the relationship be-tween the state of Minnesota and the tribes isthe envy of other states partly because ofsuccessful programs that provide scholar-ships, housing, and other aid to Indians. Whitefeather served as spokesperson forHistoric dialogue . . . Tribal leaders, lawmakers open communication lines the tribes, acknowledging the controversiesand changes that have transformed reserva-tions and Indian life in recent years: casinos,welfare reform, treaty rights for fishing andhunting, and tribal sovereignty. \"Welfare reform is probably the most talked-about issue this legislative session,\"he said. \"Indian tribes were not given enoughconsideration when the act was written. Itshould have been written with some recog-nition of and sensitivity to the culture ofnative persons.\" The casinos, as important as they are, won't solve all Indian problems, he said,adding, \"We've been in a continual mode ofsurvival.\" Typical casino jobs don't pay wages that support families, Whitefeather said, andreservations still have a difficult time attract-ing other forms of industry. In fact, reserva-tions often suffer unemployment at rates of40 percent and higher. \"We'd be happy tobring it down to the levels of the Great De-pression,\" when unemployment stood atabout 20 percent, he said. Non-Indians,Marge Anderson, chief executive of the MilleLacs Band of Ojibway, said, make up 80percent of the state's casino workforce. Dallas Ross, chair of the state's Indian Affairs Council, said that infant mortality,joblessness, poor health, and poverty still Bobby Whitefeather, chair of the Red Lake Nation, led a group of speakers at a historic meeting betweenstate and tribal officials March 19 at the Capitol. Representatives from the state's 11 Native American bands were invited to address a joint meeting of the House and Senate local government committees March 19. Some of the participants were, left to right: Bobby Whitefeather, Dallas Ross, Norman Deschampe, Marge Anderson, Derelyn Lehto, Loretta Gagnon, and Peter Defoe.4 SESSION WEEKLY / March 21, 1997plague Indian populations. \"We have a long way to go before we can catch up with therest of society, much less get rich,\" he said.(While a few casinos do have highly publi-cized profit-sharing arrangements with in-dividual members of the band, many don't.)He said the casinos make it possible to closethe income gap with \"dignity and strength.\" Derelyn Lehto, vice chair of the Prairie Island Tribal Council, said, \"Gaming is theone thing we can point to and say it's havingan impact. The Treasure Island Casino hascreated a new reservation. . . . Ten years ago,we were hardly spectators in the politicalprocess. Now we're players.\" Anderson said tribes are using the rev- enues to build or purchase health care facili-ties, schools, housing, banks, and retailoutlets. They're also investing in businessand partnerships, while increasing their ef-fect on Minnesota's economy. In 1993, a Minnesota Planning study showed tribal gaming had created 10,350jobs, resulting in $7 million in annual wel-fare savings and a 16-percent decline in AFDCrecipients in counties with casinos. By 1997,a study by the Minnesota Indian GamingCommission shows gaming has produced11,465 jobs, a 58-percent decrease in Indiansreceiving general assistance, and a 17-per-cent decrease in AFDC payments in countieswith casinos. Still, Loretta Gagnon, member-at-large of the Indian Affairs Council, said that urbanIndian populations are plagued by poverty,unemployment, health problems, and pooreducation levels. In Minneapolis, 53 percentof Indians live below poverty level; at 41percent, St. Paul isn't much better. And, shesaid, \"Our children are disproportionatelypoor.\" \"If you asked me to describe in three words the state of Indian affairs, I'd say 'fragile,misunderstood, and hopeful,\" Ross said.\"Most tribes are still recovering from the19th century and trying to catch up with the20th.\" The leaders made clear that they take tribal sovereignty seriously. \"I'm hopeful that tribalsovereignty will no longer be regarded as athreat, but for what it is \u2014 an inherentright,\" Ross said. \"Why is sovereignty so important?\" asked Norman Deschampe, president of the Min-nesota Grand Portage Band of Chippewa.\"It's the internationally recognized right ofpeople to govern themselves. Sovereignty iswho we are,\" and, he added, it will lead thetribes to self-sufficiency. Rep. Satveer Chaudhary (DFL-Fridley) received applause when he spoke of pride inbeing the only Indian in the Minnesota Leg-islature. Later, he said, he looks forward \"to taking pride in not being the only Indian inthe Legislature.\" Noting that progress has been made, Rep. Phil Carruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Center) saidthat much more needs to be done. \"A chal-lenge for each of us is to make sure thingscontinue to get better.\" In closing, Whitefeather said that the tribes appeared before the Legislature \"with someforcefulness,\" frustrated at the slow pace ofchange. Indian tribes have had to endure agreat deal, he said, including treaty viola-tions, forced assimilation, and a looseningconnection with their culture. \"We endure,but we strive to survive. That's a key wordbecause it's the best we can hope for at thispoint.\" He requested that legislative leadersconsider continued meetings with tribal lead-ers. \"Indian tribes will survive in perpetuityalong with our non-Indian neighbors.\" \u2014 Celeste Riley BUSINESSSALES CRIMESmoke ads limited Several times a week, Robert Wojcicki picks up his three-year-old daughter, Anna, fromher downtown St. Paul day care facility. Oneday, as they were getting her jacket from thecoatroom, Anna pointed out a window anddrew her Dad's attention to the smiling faceof Joe Camel peering down from a billboardacross the street. \"I'd seen it every day,\" Wojcicki said of the cartoon tobacco image, \"but I never pickedup on it. Anna sure did, though. As a parenttrying to raise law-abiding children, I'm ask-ing for a level playing field. I don't want herexposed to products that she can't legallybuy.\" If the Legislature approves HF688 , as the House Commerce, Tourism and ConsumerAffairs Committee did March 19 on a 12-11vote, Wojcicki may get his wish. The billwould \"restrict tobacco advertising wherethe tobacco advertising is likely to be seen byminors.\" The average age of beginning smokers, said HF688 sponsor Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul), is 13 years old. What's more,he said, it's well documented that tobaccocompanies have long had in place marketingstrategies aimed at seducing kids \u2014 referredto in an R.J. Reynolds internal memo as\"pre-smokers\" \u2014 into the nicotine habit. \"We've added vendors to the list of those subject to penalties\" for supplying smokes tokids, Paymar said. \"It is time to take a boldstep to make an impact on the demand side.\"Paymar said he had worked hard to craft a bill that would regulate commercial speechin a manner that does not trample advertis-ers' First Amendment rights. Hamline Uni-versity School of Law Professor David Cobin,who teaches constitutional law, testified thatthe bill would pass constitutional muster. The question is one of balance, he said. To succeed, the state must demonstrate a com-pelling interest and prove that the law wouldadvance that interest. Moreover, the statemust prove that the law is, in fact, enforce-able and that there is simply no other way toachieve the desired goal other than banningthis particular form of commercial speech. \"In my opinion, this law would be consti- tutional,\" Cobin said, adding that HF688 is patterned after a Baltimore ordinance thathas survived two challenges in the U.S. FourthCircuit Court of Appeals. A lawyer for the American Advertising Federation, though, challenged Cobin's as-sessment, calling the bill \"unlawful.\" Federal law, said Dan Troy, routinely pro- vides for the regulation of tobacco advertis-ing by Congress, and Congress has alreadyspoken on this issue. In 1965, he said, to-bacco manufacturers won the right to adver-tise on billboards at the same time they agreedto start placing warning labels on their prod-ucts. The Supreme Court has made it cleartime and again, he said, that this languagetrumps all other state attempts at regulation. Moreover, Troy said, the Baltimore law cited by Cobin has not yet cleared every legalhurdle and could still be declared unconsti-tutional. Indeed, he said, the Supreme Courtwill take it up in a few months. \"The general rule is that the speaker and the audience \u2014 not the government \u2014 de-cide the value of the information,\" Troy said.\"The mere fact that someone one day maythrow a jar of peanut butter at the presiden-tial motorcade does not mean that we canban peanut butter advertising.\" Yet, by the narrowest of margins, the com- mittee decided it could, sending the measureto the House floor for final approval. Silencers on police guns A bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee March 19 would broaden thecircumstances under which Department ofCorrections (DOC) officials can carry guns,and would allow police officers to use silenc-ers on guns in some high-risk situations. Current law prohibits DOC officials from5 March 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYDEVELOPMENTcarrying weapons off prison grounds. That includes on-duty time transporting prison-ers between institutions or to other places,such as doctor appointments. The DOChandles between 50 and 100 of those tripsevery day, said DOC commissioner FredLaFleur, and those trips are becoming in-creasingly dangerous. One reason guards are prohibited from carrying guns at those times is a fear that theweapons could be used against them in aprisoner attack. But, LaFleur said, \"over theyears the prison population has become moresophisticated and armed. We need to giveemployees a certain amount of assurancethat they will not be put at risk.\" \"In the past year, it has become clear that there's a problem with the law and the abilityof DOC employees to perform their duties,\"said Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), com-mittee chair. Skoglund sponsors HF614 , which would allow DOC officials to carry firearms in thecourse of official duties. These could includetransporting inmates or apprehending vio-lators of parole or supervised release. The bill also authorizes law enforcement agencies to use silencers (devices that quietor muffle the sound of a gunshot) in thecourse of some duties. Current law prohibitsthe use of such devices. An example , Skoglund said, would be to stop an attacking dog while police attempt tomove in for a raid on a suspected drug house. The bill now moves to the House floor. Coordinated land planning Two bills ( HF217 and HF1000 ) approved by the House Environment and Natural Re-sources Committee March 17 offer differentapproaches to curtailing sprawl in GreaterMinnesota. Urban growth has been gobbling up open land on the edges of the Twin Cities metro-politan area for decades. Now it is takingsubstantial bites out of Minnesota's ruralareas as well. Statewide, urban developmentconsumes about 68 acres per day. Since the mid-1970s, the Metropolitan Council has planned and shaped develop-ment in the seven-county metropolitan area.The council periodically reviews its Metro-politan Urban Service Area (MUSA) bound-ary. Inside the boundary, new developmentis provided with municipal utility servicessuch as roads, water, and sewer. Outside theMUSA, development is more restricted andreceives no such services.HF217 provides the legal framework and funding to extend state-mandated compre-hensive planning to Minnesota's rural coun-ties, cities, and townships. Bill sponsor Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud) explained that developers are cur-rently avoiding the restrictions imposed onthem by the Metropolitan Council by build-ing in surrounding counties. These develop-ments often take the form of highpricedhousing on five-acre plots of former farmland. Projections are that central Minnesota will get 100,000 new residents in the next decade,Opatz told the panel. \"That is like picking upthe entire city of Duluth and setting it on topof Anoka. We have no plan for all of thatgrowth.\" Opatz explained that state-mandated plan- ning is necessary because local governmentofficials are often reluctant to restrict landuse when a friend, family member, or neigh-bor has something to gain from a new devel-opment. HF217 would require all Minnesota coun- ties outside the Metropolitan area to submitcomprehensive land-use plans to the stateOffice of Strategic and Long-Range Plan-ning. The plans must conform to 12 goals forsustainable development outlined in the bill. Counties with a population density greater than 50 people per square mile and gainingpopulation at a rate faster than the state as awhole would be considered \"growth\" coun-ties. In growth counties, any land not in-cluded within a municipal plan would bezoned as permanent agricultural land, wheredevelopments would be limited to one dwell-ing unit per 40 acres. Seven counties \u2014Benton, Chisago, Isanti, Olmsted, Sherburne,Stearns, and Wright \u2014 would currentlyqualify as growth counties. Under the bill, any municipality that does not submit a comprehensive plan to itscounty board would have a plan preparedfor it by the county. If a county board doesnot submit a plan to the Office of Strategicand Long-Range Planning, that agency wouldprepare a plan for the county. The bill alsowould appropriate an unspecified amountto provide grants for local planning efforts. In previous committee hearings, the bill garnered support from the Coalition ofGreater Minnesota Cities, the Builders Asso-ciation of Minnesota, the Minnesota Asso-ciation of Realtors, and the MetropolitanCouncil. HF1000 , sponsored by Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls), tackles the sprawl problem withdifferent tools. The bill would provide tech-nical assistance and financial incentives tocounties that voluntarily participate in a plan- ning process. Counties receiving such assis-tance would be required to adhere to 10goals for community-based planning andcoordinate with municipalities within theirjurisdiction and with neighboring counties. Unlike Opatz's bill, HF1000 would in- clude the seven-county metropolitan area. Itwould require the Metropolitan Council toamend its development guidelines to reflectthe bill's 10 community-based planninggoals. Long's bill also would establish an advi- sory council to develop a framework forcommunity-based planning and create thetools and incentives to implement the plans. \"Presumably, before we reach the [House] floor, we will merge the two bills,\" Long said. Opatz agreed that the two bills are not incompatible and could be merged. Both bills now move to the House Gov- ernmental Operations Committee. Bigger convention center The House Economic Development and International Trade Committee approved abill that would use state dollars to jump-starta long sought expansion of the MinneapolisConvention Center. Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton, along with several other city finance offi-cials, appeared at the March 19 meeting totestify in favor of HF1529 , calling the mea- sure more important to the city's economicvitality than any other project, including theproposed new baseball stadium for the Min-nesota Twins. \"The convention center is one of our top priorities,\" Sayles Belton said. \"The successof many Minnesota businesses hinges on thesuccess of this public/private partnership.\" The bill, sponsored by Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls), would provide Min-neapolis with an unspecified amount ofmoney from the state's general fund to ini-tiate construction at the facility, with thebalance of the cost financed by a future statebonding measure. Jefferson told the com-mittee the state's general fund contributionwould be $37.5 million. The project's totalcost is estimated at $147.5 million. The expansion, said Jefferson and Sayles Belton, actually represents a completion ofthe project. The original plans, which calledfor nearly 500,000 square feet of floor space,were scaled back to the existing 280,000square feet after then-Gov. Rudy Perpichvetoed proposed state funding in 1985. Instead, the city paid for the convention6 SESSION WEEKLY / March 21, 1997 EDUCATIONSCHOOLDWIcenter with $350 million in bonds, imposing a half-cent sales tax to service the debt. Un-der HF1529 , the city would continue to im- pose the sales tax until all of the bonds issued\u2014 including future bonds let by the state \u2014had been retired. Both Jefferson and Sayles Belton said that without the extra square footage, the con-vention center would no longer be a playeron the national convention scene. In fact,Minneapolis has slipped in the market fromthe 13th largest facility in 1986 to 43rd in1996. As a result, the state has lost millions inout-of-town dollars. \"If we let this happen, we will . . . be once again competing with ourselves rather thanwith the rest of the country,\" Jefferson said,adding that smaller facilities in Greater Min-nesota support the Minneapolis expansion.\"Completing the convention center puts usright back into the national market.\" The committee sent the bill to its finance division, where members will scrutinize thefiscal details. Gravel supply pits Gravel, used extensively by the construc- tion industry, is becoming increasingly hardto come by in Minnesota, said Roger Brice,of the Department of Natural Resources(DNR), in testimony before the House Gov-ernmental Operations Committee. \"We're projecting a huge shortfall of gravel,\" Brice said. \"Some of the reasons aredifficulty in locating new gravel pits becauseof local concerns and local extraction taxes.There are a lot of issues we think need to beconsidered.\" HF663 , sponsored by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia), would create a task force tostudy the issue and recommend ways to easethe problem. It was approved by the com-mittee on March 18. \"We use about eight tons of sand and gravel per person in the state of Minnesotaeach year,\" said the DNR's Ron Visness.\"This is primary building material.\" Visnesssaid the materials are used in paving streetsand in building basements. While demand ison the increase, supply is dwindling. Notonly do companies have to transport it fromfarther and farther away, fewer and fewercommunities are willing to have gravel pitsdug in their area, he said. \"Does this mean gravel policy is in the pits?\" Rep. Bill Hilty (DFL-Finlayson) asked. HF663 now moves to the House Environ- ment and Natural Resources Finance Com-mittee.Tougher on DWI offenders On March 14, the House Judiciary Committee's DWI Subcommittee approvedseveral bills that will become part of an om-nibus bill to be acted upon later this session. HF918 would use new technology to deal with repeat offenders and to enhance publicsafety. Under the bill, sponsored by Rep.Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), a person ar-rested twice or more for a DWI offense couldavoid pre-trial detention by agreeing to elec-tronic alcohol monitoring. The option ispossible because of a computerized breathtester that can be plugged into a telephone.Three times per day the monitored personwould provide a breath sample into the tester,the results of which would be transferredimmediately via phone to authorities. Under the terms of the monitoring agree- ment, the person must abstain entirely fromalcohol consumption. Any violation wouldgenerate an arrest warrant. The monitoring procedure has been used in more than 3,000 pre- and post-trial DWIcases. Tenth District Court Judge James Dehn told the committee that many of those whohave been required to undergo the monitor-ing have said it helped them control theiralcohol abuse. The legislation also would reduce the bur- den on prison space. \"We don't have enoughjail space to put all the DWI offenders in jail,but we can monitor them,\" Skoglund said. The committee also approved HF1061 , which would increase the penalties for thoseconvicted of driving with a blood-alcoholconcentration of 0.20 or higher. The crimewould be a gross misdemeanor and apply toautomobiles, snowmobiles, all-terrain ve-hicles, and boats. While current law calls forincreasing penalties for DWI offenders whorepeat, there is no penalty distinction basedon the offender's increase in blood-alcohollevel. The penalties also would include elec- tronic monitoring during pre-trial release;one year of monitoring after conviction; andchemical-use assessment and treatment. Forrepeat offenders at the higher blood-alcohollevel, the penalties would include the aboveas well as a 30-day jail term, and a longerdriver's license revocation. It also would re-duce the number of offenses from four withinfive years to three within five years before anoffender's license plates would be impoundedand vehicles forfeited. The committee also added a part of HF506 ,a school bus equipment and safety bill, to the omnibus DWI bill. Sponsored by Rep. DougSwenson (R-Forest Lake), the measure a \"not for schoolbus drivers' blood-alcohol content. The sec-tion would make it a misdemeanor for anyperson to drive a school bus if there is anypresence of alcohol in the body. Current lawcalls for the penalty for an alcohol concen-tration of at least 0.04. Stopping cyberporn A proposal to require the use of blocking software to prevent students from visitingpornographic sites on the Internet has beenstripped of its toughest provisions. HF575 , sponsored by Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka), was approved March 18 by theQuality Initiatives Subcommittee of theHouse Education Committee. The proposal would require the Depart- ment of Children, Families and Learning towork with school districts to develop modelpolicies for Internet use in schools. A provision that would have required the department to make blocking software avail-able at no cost to school districts and requireschools to use it was deleted from the legis-lation. School and district officials made up the core of the opposition to the plan to requirethe use of blocking software. Jeff Holte, director of technology, Buffalo-Hanover-Montross School District, spoke againsta bill that would have required mandatorypornography-blocking computer software forschool computers. His testimony came before theEducation Committee's Quality InitiativesSubcommittee March 18.7 March 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYMarketed under catchy names such as Net Nanny and Cyber Patrol, the software iscrafted to filter out pornographic and vio-lent images. However, critics claim the tech-nology is imperfect and denies Internet usersaccess to useful information. Patricia Sween, a media specialist in the Red Wing School District, said blocking soft-ware \"has not proven to be effective.\" Itblocks some useful information and missessome of the undesirable material, she said. For example, Sween said, software de- signed to block sites related to sex can denyaccess to pornographic web sites, but it alsocan block sites related to sexual harassment,sexual discrimination, or other legitimateresearch topics. \"Our obligation is to teach responsible use of the Internet,\" she said. \"Trying to blockout sites by using various kinds of software isnot going to work.\" Weaver urged committee members to con- sider the dangers of allowing students accessto obscene material and the potential liabil-ity of schools if they do not take action toprevent it. \"I look at it as a safety issue,\" Weaver said. \"We know pornography hurts people. That'swhy this is a must.\" And, Weaver said, blocking technology would not interfere with legitimate researchbecause instructors would be able to lift thesoftware whenever necessary. \"The stuff you can get on the Internet is remarkable in terms of how graphic it is,\"Weaver said. \"You don't want your kids tosee it. That's the bottom line.\" School officials, however, asked that they continue to have the ability to set their ownpolicies for Internet use. \"We care very much about wanting our kids to have safe experiences on the Inter-net,\" said Jeff Holte, director of technologyin the Buffalo-Hanover-Montrose are very, very cautious.\" Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal), who offered the amendment to delete the block-ing software requirement, said blocking soft-ware is just one of many approaches that canbe used to protect students on the Internet. Weaver said the amendment, which passed on a 5-4 vote, \"rips the heart out of the bill.\" The bill now moves to the full Education Committee. Securing superintendents The House Education Committee ap- proved two bills March 18 designed to helpschool districts attract and retain qualitysuperintendents.HF897 would provide districts limited authority to exceed the current state cap onthe salary of superintendents, and HF937 would double the amount of time districtsare allowed to keep interim superintendents. Current state law caps the salary of school superintendents at 95 percent of thegovernor's salary of $114,506 a year. Schooldistricts have complained that the cap hurtstheir ability to compete with districts in otherstates for top superintendent candidates. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), who is sponsoring HF897 , said the bill would allow local school boards to better competefor top superintendents and set the salaryaccording to what is acceptable in the com-munity. Under Greiling's bill, districts would be allowed to exceed the current salary cap onlyif they negotiate a superintendent contractincluding performance requirements. Such requirements would have to include student achievement and also could includecurriculum improvement, student atten-dance, and other factors. The performance provisions drew criti- cism from Rep. Ken Wolf (R-Burnsville),who argued the salary cap ought to be re-pealed outright if it is going to be tamperedwith at all. Wolf said similar performance-based pay measures are not applied to teachers andothers in the education system. And, he said,districts could craft superintendent contractsso that performance measures are easily Ready reader Semaj Terrell, a fifth-grader at RamseyInternational Fine Arts School in Minneapolis,sat before the Higher Education FinanceDivision March 14 and read his essay on how aprogram called Get Ready has helped him startthinking about and preparing for college.reached and the salary cap is easily evaded. \"This is just a game to me,\" Wolf said.The salary cap for superintendents has been in place since 1983, and legislative at-tempts to repeal the cap in recent years havefailed. Greiling said linking more accountability to increased salaries should make her pro-posal more palatable to lawmakers. Her billnow goes to the House floor. HF937 would double the current 90-work- ing-day limit on the tenure of interim super-intendents and lift a provision in current lawallowing individuals to fill the interim roleno more than three times. Bill sponsor Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL- Crystal) said districts often have difficultycompleting a search for a superintendentwithin 90 days. The bill would provide districts the time they need to conduct a search and wouldensure that the best people are allowed toserve on an interim basis, according toCarlson. His bill now goes to House Govern-mental Operations Committee. Private school PSEO At the end of her junior year in high school, Kathryn Bryant had an extremely tough de-cision to make, one that would not havebeen necessary but for a hitch in currentstate law. Bryant hoped to participate in a state pro- gram that allows high school students to takecollege courses while still receiving creditsneeded for high school graduation. But, because she attended a private school, Bryant had to leave behind her friends andclassmates to become eligible for thepostsecondary enrollment options program(PSEO). \"Either you have to leave your private school and not graduate with your friends oryou can't participate in the program,\" Bryantsaid in March 20 testimony before the HouseEducation Committee. Bryant supported a bill ( HF1052 ) that would make it possible for private schoolstudents to participate in the postsecondaryprogram without having to transfer to apublic school. Bill sponsor Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer (R-Princeton) said the program was not in-tended to serve only public school students. Current law, according to Koppendrayer, does not deny private school students accessto the postsecondary program, but it forcesthem to give up their \"identity in their ownschool\" to participate. The bill would not give any financial ben-8 SESSION WEEKLY / March 21, 1997 efits to private schools, Koppendrayer added. State funds for the program go directly to thepostsecondary institution where the studentenrolls. \"This bill is not about private schools at all,\" said Bob Wedl, commissioner of theDepartment of Children, Families and Learn-ing. \"This is about students.\" Supporters of the bill include the depart- ment and Education Committee membersfrom both sides of the aisle. \"What we have right now is obviously a joke,\" said Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee). \"I think any student should beable to access postsecondary enrollmentoptions.\" The bill was approved by the committee and sent to its K-12 Finance Division forinclusion in the omnibus education bill to becompiled later in the legislative session. As for Bryant, now a sophomore at Bethel College in Arden Hills, she ended up leavingthe private school she had attended sincepre-school \u2014 New Life Academy inWoodbury \u2014 to take part in thepostsecondary program. She officially enrolled at Woodbury High School and attended college courses full-time during her senior year. In the end, shegraduated from a school where she neverattended a single class. \"It was sad to me that I wasn't able to get a diploma from the school I had attended for13 years,\" Bryant said. Marlon Glass, a seventh-grader at NewVisions School in Minneapolis, waited histurn to testify before the K-12 EducationFinance Division March 19 on his experienceattending a charter school.ENVIRONMENTELECTIONS Charter schools No class, no car, no way An effort to link teen driving privileges to academics has run out of gas. HF446 , which would strip high school dropouts of their driver's licenses, was re-jected March 19 by the House Transporta-tion and Transit Committee. \"You're tying two things together that I don't think are necessarily related,\" said Rep.Howard Swenson (R-Nicollet), one of 11committee members who voted against thebill. Seven members supported the proposal. Bill sponsors Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls) and Rep. Harry Mares (R-White Bear Lake)argued that the bill would motivate studentsto stay in school. \"We're talking about a principle of re- sponsibility, and the responsibility of a teen-ager is to stay in school, to get an education,and to graduate,\" Mares said. The bill would affect students 16 or 17 years old who do not regularly attend classes.The state would be allowed to suspend thelicense of students who withdraw fromschool, are dismissed (suspended or ex-pelled), or are habitually truant. Dropouts and habitual truants would lose their li-censes until they turn 18. Several committee members voiced con- cerns about punishing students when par-ents and schools face no sanctions for theirroles in the failure of students. \"We've got to stop beating up on kids,\" said Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison). Biernat said the bill would succeed in keep- ing some children in school who might oth-erwise drop out. \"At some point, we have to look that child in the eye and say you have a responsibilityhere, too,\" Biernat said. The transportation panel's action ends \u2014 at least for now \u2014 the bill's perilous journeythrough the committee process. As originally introduced, the bill would have connected driving to academic perfor-mance by requiring 16- and 17-year-olds topass the state's basic skills tests in readingand math before getting a driver's license. Earlier this month, the House Education Committee removed portions of the bill re-lated to testing and left only the provisionsthat would mandate that dropouts and tru-ants have their licenses suspended.Caucuses: lowering the age Many laws directly affect the lives of mi- nors, but only people 18 and older have a sayin their making. A bill sponsored by Rep.Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) would openup part of the election process to people 16and 17 years old. On March 17, the House General Legisla- tion, Veterans Affairs, and Elections Com-mittee approved HF703 , which would allow 16- and 17-year-olds to participate in pre-cinct caucuses as voters or delegates. Theyoung people must be enrolled in school atthe time of the caucus and live within theprecinct. The change would be at the option of the political party and the affected Senate, House,or county district. \"Current law requires an individual to be 18 years or older by election day to vote andparticipate in precinct caucuses,\" Dawkinstold the committee. \"This bill doesn't re-quire, but permits, the participation [ofyoung people].\" He said it was a way toencourage and nurture their interest in thepolitical process. \"We learn a lot more by being a part of it than by reading about it in a high schooltextbook,\" said David Stradness, a student atMounds View High School. HF703 now moves to the House floor. Windbreakers Two bills authorizing state funds to plant trees in rural areas won approval from theHouse Environment and Natural ResourcesCommittee March 17. HF1557 appropriates $2 million each year in 1998 and 1999 to renovate, maintain, andestablish tree windbreaks adjacent to ruralcommunities, farm fields, and homes. Wind-breaks also would help control snowdrifting,conserve energy, control soil erosion, andadd to wildlife habitat, said Rep. Tim Finseth(R-Angus), co-author of the legislation. Konrad Kossman, a soil and water conser- vation district manager from WashingtonCounty, told the panel that the typical wind-break consists of shrubs and conifers. Manyrural windbreaks are quite old and in need ofrenovation, he said. Others need to beplanted. The money would be administered by the Board of Water and Soil Resources (BWSR).9 March 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYGrants would be made to local soil and water conservation districts to implement cost-sharing contracts with landowners. HF1561 would make an identical appro- priation from the state trunk highway fundto the BWSR for what its authors call \"livingsnow fences.\" Grants would be given to localsoil and water conservation districts for cost-sharing contracts with landowners to estab-lish and maintain plantings of trees, shrubs,and grass strips to control snow driftingalong public roadways. Speaking on behalf of both bills, Sally Westby, of the Minnesota Association ofSoil and Water Conservation Districts, said,\"If these [windbreaks and snowbreaks] hadbeen in place this winter, we wouldn't bespending $20 million for emergency snowremoval.\" Both bills will now move to the Environ- ment and Natural Resources Finance Com-mittee. Relays added to mercury law A bill regulating mercury-containing products was approved by the House March20. The vote was 110-23. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cause permanent nervous system damage.Since mercury is an volatile element, it doesnot degrade in the environment, but be-comes airborne and eventually returns toearth to contaminate watersheds. It also ac-cumulates in animal tissue as it moves up thefood chain. Consumption of fish from 90percent of Minnesota's lakes is currentlyrestricted because of mercury contamina-tion. The bill, ( HF949 ) sponsored by Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls), adds commercialelectrical relays to a list of products fromwhich mercury must be removed for reuseor recycling prior to disposal. \"When weoriginally passed the bill to regulate mercuryrecycling in products, we left out electricalrelays,\" said Wagenius. \"These relays areshowing up in the waste stream and need tobe included [in the law].\" Regulations currently in effect include such devices as thermostats, thermometers, andswitches. Manufacturers are required to la-bel all mercury-containing products and ac-cept them back for recycling or properdisposal. Wagenius cited a program oper-ated by Minneapolis-based Honeywell, Inc.as a model for mercury recycling. The bill now moves to the Senate.HIGHER EDUCATIONFAMILY Food, education dollars Anticipating an even greater demand on food shelves this spring when many ofMinnesota's poor will see a cut in their foodstamps, a bill before the House Family andEarly Childhood Education Finance Divi-sion would more than double the dollars thestate spends on food shelf programs. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul), would set aside $3 millionduring the 1998-1999 state budgeting pe-riod for 203 Minnesota food shelves. Theycurrently receive $700,000 a year. The committee did not vote on the bill (HF817 ) March 17, but it is being consid- ered for inclusion in the committee's omni-bus budget bill that is expected later thissession. \"I know of no public policy justification for taking away food from people,\" Marianisaid regarding the new federal welfare cuts,most of which are scheduled to hit later thisspring and summer. Jo-Anne Rowan of the Francis Basket food shelf in the Highland Park area of St. Paulserves a large legal immigrant population,half of whom are expected to lose all theirfood stamps. Rowan said the food shelf's donors would have to donate seven times as much to makeup for the federal welfare cuts. Rev. Chris Morton, of MinnesotaShare, told lawmakers that the local religious, busi-ness, and civic communities \"are alreadydoing as much as they can.\" \"We need the government to remain a major player,\" he said. In other matters, the panel heard a bill that would increase funding for a program thatbrings babies and toddlers together with theirparents to learn about a child's emotional,physical, mental, and educational develop-ment. The bill ( HF1346 ), also sponsored by Mariani, would increase the funding for EarlyChildhood Family Education (ECFE), a 23-year-old program designed for children frombirth to kindergarten and their parents. Thebill would increase the program's funding byabout $8.5 million over current spending infiscal year 1998 and by about $6.1 million infiscal year 1999. That would bring theprogram's total state aid to about $40.2 mil-lion over the 1998-1999 budgeting period. Mariani's bill is more generous than Gov. Arne Carlson's proposal for the ECFE pro-gram. The governor recommended about$2.2 million more in 1998 and about $2 million more in 1999. Specifically, the bill's increased funding would come from an increase in the dollaramount allocated per child from $101.25 to$130. Since local school districts are allowed to levy local taxes for this program, the formulachange also will increase money raised fromlocal taxes without raising the tax rate. The finance division did not vote on HF1346 but is expected to consider the bill for inclusion in its omnibus budget bill. Virtual university Anyone who has stood in long lines at a college or university to register for classesmay be interested in HF273 , approved by the House Education Committee's Higher Edu-cation Finance Division March 17. The bill would appropriate $2 million to help pay for \"Virtual U Minnesota,\" whichwould enable students to register via theInternet for classes at almost every collegeand university in the state. The programwould be a cooperative venture involvingthe University of Minnesota (U of M), Min-nesota State Colleges and Universities(MnSCU), and Minnesota's private colleges. \"This would serve as a gateway leading to all higher education existing in Minnesota,\"said Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL-Winona),committee chair and the bill's sponsor. \"It'sthe first time the three entities have workedtogether to enhance higher education in thestate.\" The U of M and MnSCU each would con- tribute $250,000 during fiscal years 1998 and1999 to help in the eventual development ofon-line courses. An advisory council wouldprovide the Legislature with a plan for Vir-tual U Minnesota by January 1998. The plan is based on the web page cur- rently used by the U of M. According to JohnGunyou, executive director of the Minne-sota Office of Technology, Virtual U Minne-sota is meant to improve access to courseofferings, expand choices in degree programs,allow for transfer of credits between schools,and increase off-campus learning opportu-nities. \"This is about how you support access to education for users throughout the system,\"said Don Riley, associate vice president ofacademic affairs at the U of M. \"It will letmore people find out more easily what wehave available already in the state.\"10 SESSION WEEKLY / March 21, 1997 Pelowski added that the effort does not duplicate existing services, but builds uponthem. \"If we proceed as planned, we'll set thestandard for virtual U's around the coun-try.\" He also noted that the services would beespecially useful to high school guidancecounselors. HF273 was later approved by the Educa- tion Committee and now moves to the Waysand Means Committee. Adult learningHOUSING Keith Norling, Alexandria, Minn., testified March 18 before the Family and Early ChildhoodEducation Finance Division in support of a bill that would spend more money on adult basiceducation. Norling who graduated from high school with a third-grade reading level and whohas benefited from tutoring, now volunteers as a reading tutor for adults.Gopher college bonds A bill that aims to help parents save for their children's college education was ap-proved March 18 by the House Capital In-vestment Committee. HF130 would make affordable, tax-free bonds available from the state. Bill sponsorRep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal) said theaim of his proposal is provide \"one moreinvestment vehicle\" to families planning fora child's future. \"We really have to do more to encourage people to save for a college education,\"Carlson said. Under the bill, the Department of Finance would be required to make the general obli-gation bonds sold to finance state construc-tion projects available at a lower cost. Currently, the bonds are sold at a mini- mum $5,000 denomination, but the bill callsfor bonds to be made available in denomina-tions as small as $500. (The denomination isthe value upon maturity. The amount ofinvestment varies according to interest rates.) The smaller bonds would be available to anyone, but the bill includes provisions de-signed to encourage their purchase for col-lege savings.First, the bill stipulates that up to $25,000 in bonds would not count against a studentwhen determining eligibility for state grants.Second, the bill would allow employees touse a payroll deduction plan to purchasebonds, thus decreasing the employee's tax-able income. (See Feb. 14, 1997, Session Weekly, page 7, and Feb. 28, 1997, Session Weekly , page 11.) Carlson said his bill would set up a pro- gram, dubbed Gopher State Bonds, similarto ones already in place in 24 other states. The bill now goes to the House Ways and Means Committee. Maintaining 68 degrees Go anywhere outdoors during a Minne- sota winter and it is cold. But some Minne-sota rental property is cold on the inside,too. A proposed bill ( HF1378 ) would require that property owners maintain a tempera-ture of at least 68 degrees in all rental unitswhere the tenant does not control the heat,and that all rental heating equipment becapable of maintaining 68 degrees when theoutside temperature is -20 degrees or below.The bill was approved by the House Eco-nomic Development and InternationalTrade's Housing and Housing Finance Divi-sion March 18. Sponsored by Rep. Rob Leighton (DFL- Austin), the bill also would allow tenants tomake repairs to heating equipment thatdoesn't meet the above standards within 48hours after making a reasonable attempt tonotify the owner. Tenant expenses for heat-ing repairs could then be deducted from monthly rent payments. Penalties, including a $100 fine for each violation, also could face landlords who failto comply with the bill. Sherry Coates, of the Community Action for Suburban Hennepin, said that her group'shousing hotline receives 75 to 100 heat-re-lated calls each season. \"Tenants can with-hold their rent and place money in escrow topay for heating repairs,\" Coates said. \"Butrent escrow actions take approximately 21days.\" Jack Horner, of the Minnesota Multi- Housing Association, told the panel that 75to 100 calls in an area with hundreds ofthousands of rental units is a pretty goodrecord. \"If a building does not have adequateheat, there are numerous actions a tenantcan take under existing law,\" Horner said.\"We strongly object to this bill. It leaves itwide open for the tenants to do whateverthey want to a landlord's property.\" Horner pointed out that many older build- ings were not designed to maintain a con-stant 68-degree temperature under the mostextreme conditions. He also said that build-ing excessive capacity into a heating systemto guarantee a constant 68 degrees wouldviolate existing federal energy conservationcodes. The bill now moves to the House Judiciary Committee. Rental walk-throughs One of the most frequent areas of dispute between landlords and tenants concerns arental unit's condition before the tenantmoved in and what damages the tenantcaused. Conflicts over apartment conditionsoften result in withheld damage deposits orlegal action. A bill ( HF1304 ) approved March 18 by the House Economic and InternationalTrade's Housing and Housing Finance Divi-sion would mandate better business prac-tices in these rental transactions. \" HF1304 would protect both tenants and landlords,\"said the bill's sponsor Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls). Clark cited cases where tenants lose their damage deposits over disputed damages andothers where tenants purposefully inflictdamage in retribution for an eviction noticeand claim the damage was pre-existing. The bill would require a landlord and tenant to walk through a residential rentalunit to identify all existing conditions beforeentering into a lease agreement. The land-lord and tenant would then sign the list of11 March 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY conditions and all parties would receive a copy of the signed list. A similar walk-throughwould be required after the tenant movesout to determine what damages had takenplace during the tenancy. Landlords who fail to comply with the law would be liable to the tenant for a $100 civilpenalty. The bill also provides for restitutionto the landlord when the tenant or thetenant's guest is convicted of damaging rentalproperty. \"Pre- and post-tenancy walk-throughs are good practices and we encourage them,\"said Jack Horner of the Minnesota Multi-Housing Association. \"But we questionwhether it is practical for the state to man-date such practices.\" Larger rental complexes may have 20 or more tenants moving out at the end of themonth, Horner said. The most commonreason for walk-throughs not working isthat tenants fail to show up, he said. Presentlaw gives the landlord 21 days to inspect theapartment and return the damage deposit. \"Idon't see how this law ( HF1304 ) could work,\" he said. The bill goes to the House Judiciary Committee. INSURANCEINSURANCE Jon Thomas Cross, who received a high score ontesting requirements for becoming a police officer,testified before the House Judiciary CommitteeMarch 17 in support of a bill that would providefunding for the Northwest Community LawEnforcement Project. The project helps minoritiesand women get the training and educationnecessary to become law enforcement officers. Italso assists participating cities to diversify theirpolice departments.Insurance protection When 86-year-old Stella Kroll boarded a city bus to return from a downtown St. Pauldoctor's office to her East Side neighbor-hood, she began a journey that would pro-vide an unwanted introduction to the worldof insurance law. On that January day, Kroll paid her fare and began walking to a seat when the busslammed to a halt to avoid an accident. Thesudden stop sent Kroll toppling backwards,bouncing off of the windshield, and landingat the bottom of the steps inside the bus door. She spent five days in the hospital with a variety of injuries and has since gone throughweeks of physical therapy. \"I was just stiff,\" Kroll said, during March 19 testimony before the House FinancialInstitutions and Insurance Committee. \"Ijust couldn't move.\" Unfortunately, Kroll had to absorb an- other blow when she returned from the hos-pital and called the bus company to discussthe accident. She was told (rather curtly, shesaid) that the bus company would not payfor any medical expenses she incurred. That,she was told, was the responsibility of herown insurance company. Indeed, the state's no-fault insurance lawrequires that Kroll's coverage come under her own automobile insurance policy. \"Why should my car insurance have to pay for it?\" Kroll asked. \"It didn't happen inmy car. It happened in their bus. I think thisstupid law should be changed.\" Kroll testified in support of a bill that would provide financial protection for thosein Kroll's situation without taking on thehighly controversial area of no-fault law. The bill ( HF1045 ) would prohibit insur- ance companies from increasing apolicyholder's premium as the result of ex-penses incurred if the person is involved inan accident while a passenger in a bus, taxi,or commuter van. Bill sponsor Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul) said Kroll did not see an increase in autoinsurance rates after the incident on the citybus, but he hopes to prevent anyone else insimilar circumstances from seeing a rate hike. The bill was approved by the House Fi- nancial Institutions and Insurance Commit-tee and now goes to the House floor. LAW Police diversity The Northwest Community Law Enforce- ment Project has helped diversify police de-partments in several Twin Cities suburbsand deserves continued funding from thestate, supporters told the House JudiciaryCommittee March 17. Lawmakers agreed, and approved HF996 , sponsored by Rep. Phil Carruthers, (DFL-Brooklyn Center), which would appropriate$625,000 to administer the organizationthrough June 1999. The program began in 1993 and first re- ceived state funding in 1995. Its goal is tohelp cities diversify their police forces byproviding access to training and educationfor minorities and women. Participants en-roll at North Hennepin Community Collegeto study law enforcement and work part-time in police departments as cadets. Thestudents also receive tuition assistance,monthly stipends, and wages for their policedepartment work. Jon Thomas Cross, a recent graduate of the program, currently is a community ser-vices officer in Golden Valley. Recently, hescored the highest among applicants takingthe test to join Golden Valley's police de-partment. He is now slated to become thatcity's first minority police officer. \"Several[former] participants are the first to repre-sent people of color in their law enforcementagencies,\" Cross told the committee. \"With- out the program, those opportunities wouldnot develop.\" Marty Williams, also a recent graduate, said he was a former high school dropout.The program, he said, has made him a rolemodel to young people in his community. Italso helped him become the first black of-ficer in New Hope's police department. Participating cities include Brooklyn Park, Brooklyn Center, Crystal, Golden Valley,Maple Grove, New Hope, Plymouth, andRobbinsdale. Of those, only Maple Grovewas bypassed in a 1996 lawsuit in which biaswas discovered in the police department ap-plication process. According to news reports,no black recruits had joined the police de-partments of 36 cities that employed theMinnesota Police Recruitment System toscreen applicants. In addition to damages,the cities were ordered to develop programsto add minority members to their policeforces. Today, the program enrolls nine students. Fifteen former participants have earned lawenforcement degrees, nine of whom went onto become police officers. Three others havejobs in other areas of law enforcement, andtwo are still looking for employment. HF996 will be added to the omnibus crime legislation to be voted on later this session.12 SESSION WEEKLY / March 21, 1997LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPORTSNo Met Council? Two bills, one to abolish the Metropolitan Council and another to have its membersstand for election, won approval from theHouse Local Government and MetropolitanAffairs Committee March 18. The Metropolitan Council, created in the 1967, is responsible for comprehensive re-gional planning for the seven-county metro-politan area. One of the largest regionalgovernments in the nation, it also overseesthe regional bus system, several wastewatertreatment facilities, and Metro Mobility (atransit operation serving the disabled). Itoversees an annual budget of about $360million, which is partially paid by propertytaxes, and manages about 3,500 employees.The council is governed by a board of 17members appointed by the governor; eachrepresents a different portion of the metroregion. HF783 , sponsored by Rep. Peg Larsen (R- Lakeland), would effectively abolish theMetropolitan Council. The 260-page billtransfers all of the council's operations toother agencies and reduces the organizationto an advisory council of local governmentofficials. \"The Met Council has become a super- government agency that has veto power overlocal governments,\" Larsen told the com-mittee. \"[It] is very removed [from localconcerns],\" she said. \"We have in the Met Council a non-elected body with tax levy authority,\" said DennisHannah of the Grey Cloud Island TownshipBoard. \"As I recall, that's what started theBoston Tea Party.\" Other members agreed.\"The Met Council has a very important role to play as facilitator and coordinator oflocal units of government. But, in addingother operations to the council, the Legisla-ture has created a monster. We need to refo-cus this organization,\" said bill co-sponsorRep. Sharon Marko (DFL-Newport). Lyle Wray, executive director of the Citizen's League, cautioned the panel againstabolishing the council. \"Many areas of thecountry are struggling to create regional ap-proaches,\" he said. \"The economic future ofour state depends on a regional approach.\" Wray said that the Metropolitan Council has more work to do in planning and coor-dinating across the region, but admitted thereis room for improvement. Jim Solum, regional administrator of the Metropolitan Council defended his organi-zation. \"Much of what you have heard to- night is simply wrong or are facts taken outof context,\" he said. \"You might spend sometime getting the facts about the kind of changethat has taken place and the kind of costsavings that have been obtained since themerger took place.\" HF783 now moves to House Transporta- tion and Transit Committee. Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL-Mpls) said that his bill ( HF423 ) responds to many of the issues raised in Larsen's bill by simply mak-ing the council an elected body. \"This bill moves to the intent of the origi- nal framers of the Metropolitan Council in1967,\" Orfield said. \"They believed that thecouncil should be elected. That prevailed inthe House but failed on a tie vote in theSenate in 1967.\" Council elections would be nonpartisan and public funding provided for qualifiedcandidates. Salaries of council memberswould not change. The bill was supported by former Minne- apolis Mayor Don Fraser, who testified onbehalf of the Minnesota Citizen's Leagueand by representatives of MetropolitanCouncil employees unions. HF783 now moves to the House General Legislation, Veterans Affairs and ElectionsCommittee. More mobile home parks Manufactured or \"mobile\" home com- munities have come a long way from thetrailer parks of the 1950s, industry represen-tatives told the House Local Governmentand Metropolitan Affairs Committee, andnow should be treated as a viable form ofmulti-family housing. A bill ( HF962 ) to allow manufactured home parks in local zoning districts thatallow multi-family housing was approvedMarch 18 by the committee. No fewer thaneight mobile homes could be sited within aone-acre area. The proposal would give mobile home park developers more places to build theircommunities and ease building codes theysay don't apply to them anyway. Most cities and towns currently allow manufactured homes in areas zoned forsingle-family housing, where they must ad-here to the same housing codes that apply topermanent construction. Many local gov-ernments, however, require special zoningfor manufactured home parks, where build-ings are set on slabs or pilings and greaterdensity is allowed. Manufactured home industry representa-tives see this as a form of discrimination. \"The simple reason for this legislation is thatwe want to be on an equal footing with otherdevelopers of multi-family housing,\" saidMark Brunner, executive vice president ofthe Minnesota Manufactured Housing As-sociation. Brunner said that manufactured housing in a park setting is one of the most affordablehome ownership opportunities available.\"People can own a home for less than $500per month,\" he said. Joel Jamnik, of the League of Minnesota Cities, and Roger Peterson, of the Associa-tion of Metropolitan Municipalities, spokeagainst the bill. \"Right now, under state law,anyone who wants to develop housing in acommunity can have a discussion with localofficials,\" Jamnik said. \"That a single-familymanufactured home could be sited in a city'smulti-family zoned area doesn't make sense.\" Bill sponsor Rep. Leslie Schumacher (DFL- Princeton), who once lived in a mobile homepark, said such housing has been discrimi-nated against in certain areas. \"I see this billas an opportunity for affordable housingand as an alternative to trailer parks.\" The bill now moves to the Economic De- velopment and International TradeCommittee's Housing and Housing FinanceDivision. High school league changes After previous failed attempts, the House Governmental Operations Committee ap-proved a bill that would significantly alterthe way the Minnesota State High SchoolLeague functions. The league, which op-poses the bill, is a nonprofit organizationthat regulates sports for private and publichigh schools throughout Minnesota. Largely at issue is the league's continued autonomy. Many committee members feelthat because the league acts with the author-ity of a state agency and receives fundingthrough school districts, it should be subjectto some of the standards that apply to gov-ernment agencies. HF747 , approved March 17, would re- duce some of the league's power by bringingit under the purview of the executive branch.Under the bill, the governor would appointthe league's president and its board, whichwould consist of parents and school repre-sentatives. The league's budget would besubmitted to the Legislature for approval, asare other executive branch agencies.13 March 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY \"The bill says that the league is not a state agency, but derives its authority from schooldistricts, which are government entities,\" saidRep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), committeechair and the bill's sponsor. \"The league usespublic money so it should be subject to cer-tain laws like a government entity.\" Further, the committee adopted HF1376 , sponsored by Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St.Paul), which would prohibit the league fromadopting or enforcing rules regardingnonschool competition in individual sports,such as tennis, golf, and track. The league hasraised the ire of some students and parentsby disqualifying students from school par-ticipation in those sports after they've par-ticipated in them outside of school. Rep. Doug Swenson (R-Forest Lake) took issue with what he saw as arbitrary and un-fair rulings by the league in controlling stu-dents' eligibility for sports participation andpointedly asked league consultant RogerAronson why he should have such authority.Aronson said that some of the league's op-erations may need updating, and that a com-promise could be worked out.TAXES $ TRANSPORTATION Linnea Mason, a senior at St. Paul Central HighSchool, told the House Governmental OperationsCommittee March 18 how she was led to believethat she could not participate in her school's crosscountry program if she ran in the Twin CitiesMarathon. The committee was hearing a bill thatwould modify Minnesota State High School Leaguerules to make it easier for participants in non-teamsports to also participate in amateur events outsideof school.Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids) con- curred, but said that further work on HF747 could take place when it's dealt with in theHouse Education Committee later thissession. Trimble and Aronson will work together to refine HF1376, which now goes to the floor. Business tax break Minnesota businesses replacing their capi- tal equipment could do so tax-free under apair of bills heard by the House TaxesCommittee's Sales and Income Tax DivisionMarch 18. \"I think the argument has been advanced, with some success, that the sales tax on capi-tal equipment does injure businesses' abilityto create jobs,\" said Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South sponsored HF684 . Rep. Ron Erhardt (R-Edina), who sponsoredHF629 and testified along with Milbert, agreed, saying the move would \"make Min-nesota businesses more competitive with therest of the world.\" Providing the exemption, Milbert said, would encourage businesses, particularlythose that have a presence in other states, toincrease their investments in Minnesota. Theeffect, he continued, would be more jobs. The two bills would achieve the same end through different means. Both bills expandthe definition of capital equipment, which isalready exempted from the sales and use tax,to include replacement purchases. Milbert'sbill would apply the exemption to goodsused by businesses that provide a taxableservice. Erhardt's bill, HF629 , would not, although he said another bill he has spon-sored would accomplish the same thing. Under existing statute, replacement pur- chases already receive preferential sales taxtreatment administered through a refundprocess. A business pays the full 6.5 percenttax up front and applies to the Departmentof Revenue for a refund. The departmentreturns a certain amount, which increasesannually, to the purchaser. That refund per-centage, currently 2.7 percent, will stand at4.5 percent in 1999. Both bills would abolish the refund mecha- nism, exempting replacement capital equip-ment at the time of purchase and costing thestate tens of millions of dollars in sales anduse tax revenue. HF684 would reduce state revenues by more than $170 million in the coming bien-nium and $145 million in the next. HF629 ,as written, would cost only $800,000 in the 1998-99 period, but more than $87 millionthrough 2001. Lobbyists representing a variety of busi- nesses testified that granting the exemption\u2014 up front, not through a refund process \u2014would encourage investment in the state andbring Minnesota in line with the rest of thecountry. \"The current system detracts . . . from the opportunity to continue growth,\" said DarylFrietag, of Precise Products. \"The moneycould be better spent on growing jobs.\" The division, which did not act on the bills, will hear further testimony later. Pay up or walk Car owners who fail to pay fines for traffic or parking violations would be denied newlicense tabs, under a bill approved March 17by the House Transportation and TransitCommittee. HF1353 , sponsored by Rep. Jim Rhodes (R-St. Louis Park), also would provide newways to avoid driver's license suspensionsfor people who violate mandatory automo-bile insurance laws for the first time. Rhodes said the provisions of the bill re- lated to unpaid fines are an effort to create a\"more fail-safe collection system.\" Currently,unpaid fines are not reported by the courtsand, as a result, are not on drivers' records. The bill would require a $1 surcharge to be added to the fine for each traffic violation tofinance the new system of ensuring that tick-ets are paid. The Department of Public Safety would be required to set up a computerized data-base listing motorists with unpaid fines. Thecourts would have to report unpaid fines tothe department for addition to the database,and courts would have to similarly reportwhen fines are paid. Deputy registrars, who handle registration renewals around the state, would have accessto the database to run a check on each vehicleowner seeking new tabs for his or her car. The bill would prohibit deputy registrars from registering a vehicle if records show anunpaid fine. Vehicle owners with unpaid finescould get new tabs by paying the amount duein fines to the deputy registrar or the court. The bill's provisions related to insurance would provide first-time violators of thestate's mandatory vehicle insurance laws away to avoid losing their driver's licenses. Rhodes said he aims to provide incentive14 SESSION WEEKLY / March 21, 1997 for violators to come into compliance with the law. Under current law, a person caught with- out automobile insurance faces misde-meanor charges, revocation of vehicleregistration, and a possible driver's licensesuspension. A second offense within 10 yearsbrings gross misdemeanor charges. The bill would allow first-time offenders to avoid a driver's license suspension as longas the violation is not discovered as the resultof a traffic accident. First-time offenderswould have 14 days to provide proof of in-surance to avoid driver's license suspension. HF1353 now moves to the House Trans- portation and Transit Finance Division. Yellow lights flashing Last November, a person driving a pickup truck approached a school bus from behind,and although the yellow warning lights onthe bus were flashing, the pickup driverslipped onto the road shoulder and passedthe bus. At the time, the bus was slowing to a halt near the home of Hampton-area residentLinda Homan, who was seeing her 5-year-old daughter off to kindergarten. Homansaid she and her daughter were fortunate toescape without being hit when the pickuppassed \"right on our toes.\" Homan did not have such good luck when she tried to get police to do something aboutthe incident. \"We are very concerned that these school bus violations are being taken far too lightlyby our legal system,\" Homan said duringMarch 17 testimony before the House Trans-portation and Transit Committee. Homan noticed the license plate number of the passing pickup and figured she had thedriver dead to rights. She was disappointedwhen she tried to report the incident to police. Passing a school bus \u2014 or any vehicle, for that matter \u2014 by driving on the road shoul-der is illegal, Homan was told. But the of-fense is only a petty misdemeanor, and itmust be witnessed by police for a citation tobe issued. Subsequently, Homan became the driving force behind a bill that would provide tougherpenalties for a violation like the one she andher daughter witnessed. The bill ( HF1266) , sponsored by Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount), was ap-proved by the transportation committee. The bill would make it a misdemeanor to pass a bus on the right side, or door side,when the bus has its yellow pre-warninglights flashing.School bus drivers or other witnesses could report a violation to police, who would thenhave four hours to issue a citation to theoffending driver. Violations would carry a minimum $300 fine, matching the penalty for violating ex-isting laws that require drivers to stop forschool buses with red lights flashing andstop arm extended. The bill now moves to the House Judiciary Committee. Commuters on freight rails Mass transit is a subject that seemingly has been studied from every conceivable angle.Now, as the Minnesota Department of Trans-portation (MnDOT) is preparing to studyseveral new highway alternatives, anothercommuter transit proposal has emerged inthe Rep. is spon- soring HF738 , directing MnDOT to study the feasibility of using existing metropolitanarea freight railroad tracks for a commuterrail service. This study would be one amongmany to address the region's commutertransportation needs between 2001 and 2020.The bill was approved by the House LocalGovernment and Metropolitan Affairs Com-mittee March 18. No appropriation was at-tached to the proposal. Al Vogel of MnDOT told the panel that such commuter rail systems typically do not run allday but rather as peak-period commuter trips.\"This is not light rail transit,\" he said. \"In othercities commuter rail most often uses existingtracks and operates in a way that is compatibleA single license plate The House approved a bill March 17 that would allow certain collector cars to displayonly one license plate. The vote was 131-2. HF454 , sponsored by Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park), would allow col-lector car owners to preserve the \"lines anddesign\" of their vehicles, most of which weremanufactured without a front license platebracket. Under the bill, certain vehicles from model years 1968 and earlier would be allowed todisplay only a rear license plate. The billwould cover automobiles registered as pio-neer, classic, or collector cars and street rods. All such registrations require that the ve- hicle be used as a collector's item and not forgeneral transportation. Rep. Rich Stanek (R-Maple Grove), who is a Minneapolis police officer, was one of the two House members to vote against thebill. Allowing such vehicles to travel withonly one license plate could hinder policeinvestigations of hit-and-run accidents andother incidents. \"You've just cut your chances of identify- ing that vehicle by 50 percent,\" Stanek said. The bill now moves the Senate.

The bill ( HF159 ) won approval from the House Health and Human Services Com-mittee and its finance division March 20. A flurry of amendments found their way onto the bill over the past two weeks, leavingthe bill's final price tag unclear. A cost analy-sis is expected when the bill goes before theWays and Means Committee March 25. Bill sponsor Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL- Harris) said the bill still has \"a few holes\" butplans to work on further changes in thecoming week. The Minnesota House and Senate are in a rush to pass a bill. The 1996 federal lawwhich drastically overhauled the welfare sys-tem required states to report their plans tomove welfare recipients to work or face mil-lions of dollars in federal penalties. The De-partment of Human Services has said theyneed a bill by early April to avoid such pen-alties. States across the country are hurrying to pass new welfare laws after the federal gov-ernment scrapped the long-standing welfaresystem in August 1996. The federal law does away with monthly welfare checks and food stamps for manylegal immigrants and eliminates disabilitycash assistance for people with drug andalcohol addictions. It also eliminates cashassistance for children with certain behav-ioral disabilities and requires able-bodiedadults, ages 18-50, who receive food stampsto work. Perhaps the most significant change in- volves poor families with children. The lawrequires these parents to get jobs and sets afive-year-lifetime limit on their welfare ben-efits. States that do not move these parents towork will be penalized by the federal govern-ment. Specifically, they'll lose millions ofdollars in federal aid. While the federal law prescribes some of what states are required to do, it leaves eachstate to decide how to design its own welfaresystem. For instance, states are free to restoresome of the cuts if they choose, but theymust use their own money to do it.Tackling welfare . . . Welfare bill taking shape, moves to Ways and Means That's precisely what the Health and Hu- man Services Finance Division did March 20when it added some $40 million in statedollars to HF159 . Much of that amount would help restore cuts to legal immigrants. About $24 million would be spent over the 1998-1999 state budgeting period to helpbuy back federal food stamps cut from about16,000 legal immigrants in Minnesota. An-other $3 million would be spent to tempo-rarily help some 3,200 legal immigrants cutoff from a federal program known as Supple-mental Security Income (SSI). SSI provides monthly cash help to needy people who are aged, blind, or disabled. Thesepeople, on average, receive a monthly fed-eral SSI check of about $378. Under the bill,they would not only qualify for a state wel-fare program (General Assistance) and re-ceive a $203 check each month, but theywould temporarily receive an extra $100 permonth from July 1, 1997, to Feb. 28, 1998. Committee members approved the tem- porary $100 boost recognizing that a stateGeneral Assistance (GA) check doesn't comeclose enough to make up for the loss of afederal SSI check. They said they hope thatthe U.S. Congress will reconsider SSI cuts tolegal immigrants. Despite being cut off from most welfare programs in the federal law, the bill keeps legal immigrants eligible for all welfare pro-grams in Minnesota, from Medical Assis-tance (a joint state-federal program for thosewho can't afford health care) to the state'snew welfare-to-work program known as theMinnesota Family Investment Program(MFIP). The measure, however, requires that the income of a legal immigrant's Americansponsor be considered when determiningeligibility for public assistance. This is inkeeping with the federal law. Below is a summary of some of the bill's highlights. Work for welfare \u2014 For several years, Minnesota has experimented with a welfarepilot program in eight counties that requirespoor families with children to work for pub- lic assistance. Under the bill, that experiment would become permanent beginning Jan. 1, 1998,and cover all 87 Minnesota counties. MFIP allows families to accept lower-pay- ing jobs while receiving some public assis-tance such as extra monthly cash andsubsidized child and health care. In theory,allowing someone to work while still receiv-ing benefits helps a low-skilled parent gainwork experience and eventually obtain abetter job. MFIP statewide would replace the tradi- tional Aid to Families with Dependent Chil-dren (AFDC) program done away with bythe 1996 federal welfare law. And, in keepingwith federal law, the bill sets a five-year,lifetime limit on receiving MFIP welfarechecks. There are some exceptions to the five-year limit, including victims of domestic abusewho need time to find safety before they cansettle into a job. Under statewide MFIP, a parent or guard- ian would be required to develop a job searchand employment plan and accept any suit-able job once they've completed all the stepsin their plan. As is the case now, the statewould continue to pay for employment and job training services. Job training money \u2014 The bill sets aside $11.5 million for such training, which trans-lates into roughly $1,400 per person. That isabout $400 more per person than Gov. ArneCarlson recommends in his budget proposaland about $600 less than the state currentlyspends in the MFIP pilot counties. Mostofficials agree, however, that the state can-not afford to spend that much if it takes theprogram statewide. Other money for em-ployment and training programs is expectedin a separate bill. Money to expand child careaid for families now required to work also isexpected in a separate bill. Perhaps the most significant change [in the federal law] involves poor families with children. The law requires these parents to get jobs and sets a five-year-lifetime limit on their welfare benefits. Continued on page 3116 SESSION WEEKLY / March 21, 1997 Without drastic changes in our education system, acorporate trainer told Min-nesota lawmakers March18, America's role as \"hare\"will be overtaken by of ThirdWorld countries in the glo-bal marketplace. \"Our kids aren't just competing with the kid down the street,\" said John Tobin, the direc-tor of applied technology training at SiemensCorp., the world's sixth-largest manufac-turer of electronic components. \"They'recompeting from Mexico, China,Japan, and Germany . . . and there's a wholegroup of have-nots who haves.Hunger is a great motivator. . . . Education,not location, is the key in a global economy.\" Tobin, the fifth and final speaker in the Capitol Forum Series, addressed legislatorsin the Minnesota History Center's 3M Audi-torium. The series' sponsors, MinnesotaTechnology and the McKnight Foundation,assembled the program to provide legisla-tors with a more expansive view of the cir-cumstances in which they make decisionsand perhaps reassess some of their closelyheld views. Past speakers included formerUnited States Vice President and Ambassa-dor to Japan Walter Mondale, who spoke ofJapan's social and business climate; and cul-tural anthropologist Jennifer James, whourged the lawmakers to open their eyes toAmerica's rapidly evolving social mythology. For his part, Tobin, in a no-nonsense ver- nacular he attributed to his New York City1950s childhood, expounded upon themescentral to corporate interests, and toSiemens in particular. He was, he said, amessenger sent from Wall Street to preachthe gospel of workforce development to agroup of lawmakers who desperately need tochange their thinking on education policy. To maintain its position of global eco- nomic dominance, Tobin said, Americaneeds to remain competitive. Success in thatendeavor can be attributed to two distinctfactors: cost and quality. Corporations can'teffectively control labor costs because Ameri-cans have refused to reduce their standard ofliving. Therefore, he continued, economi-cally underdeveloped nations can beat usbecause their citizens will work for penniesan hour. Thus, American business must cre-ate a product of superior quality.Capitol Forum . . . Tobin warns education and business need a better fit A quality product can't be made without quality workers, Tobin said, and that is whereour country's education system fails miser-ably. The American education system sim-ply does not produce the attributes in workers that are valued by corporations. \"Think about the systems you have set up and ask yourselves how many kids comingout of Minnesota schools know how to workin teams,\" Tobin said. \"It's all lecture, lec-ture, lecture . . . and then we expect them towork in teams in the real world.\" Educators and lawmakers need to start thinking of students as \"the product,\" andbusiness as the client \u2014 and business has some very specific needs. Indeed, he contin-ued, those needs have become so pressingthat Siemens now spends more than $2 mil-lion per day on its own worker trainingprograms. American students, he added, would be much better served if educators would em-brace a curriculum that caters to the needs ofthe corporate sector. \"We need to start linking schools to ca- reers. We believe public institutions can trainfor us, as vendors . . . kids as products that wecan use,\" Tobin said. \"Art and music arefine, but kids will enjoy them more if they'reemployed.\" The curriculum, he said, should empha- size the sophisticated skills \u2014 teaming, flex-ibility, process awareness, and mostimportantly, close adherence to high stan-dards. In today's high-tech world, with itsincreasing reliance on microscopic measure-ments, 90 percent is not good enough. Teach-ers and administrators cannot be afraid tohold back kids who fail, Tobin said. \"It's a guts and a courage issue on the part of the system, to enforce standards,\" Tobinsaid, adding that the people who make thetough calls can't possibly survive withoutthe backing of those in leadership positions. Legislators from both sides of the aisle agreed with much, if not all, of what Tobinhad to say, and many said they were struckby the realization that education is, in fact, atool for economic development. \"There needs to be a reason for people to go to school,\" said House Majority LeaderTed Winter (DFL-Fulda). \"We need to rein-force the value of going to school . . . andbring businesses into schools and take theteachers out to businesses.\" Other policymakers, though, didn't buy everything Tobin was selling. \"It was interesting to hear how business looks at education,\" House Minority LeaderSteve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) said. [shaping kids for work] was theonly goal, but it is a goal. It's more than justpreparing kids for a job. There's more to lifethan just a job.\" \u2014 F.J.Gallagher \"Hunger is a great motivator . . . education, not location, is the key in a global economy.\" \u2014John TobinJohn P. Tobin, director of Siemens Corp., spoke toan audience at the Minnesota History Center March18 and urged lawmakers to consider education as atool for economic development.17 March 21, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Rep. Luanne Koskinen (DFL-Coon Rap- ids) was a political veteran long before shemade her first run for office. For 25 years, she had been pounding in yard signs, handing outbrochures, and doingother forms of cam-paign legwork for a va-riety political figures,including former Merriam,former U.S. Rep. GerrySikorski, and U.S. Sen.Paul Wellstone. After helping to get Wellstone elected in 1990, Koskinen figured she would spend thesummer and fall of 1996 working to help thesenator win a second term. However, a series of events in ensuing years prompted Koskinen to become a can-didate herself. Koskinen and her family were touched by tragedy in 1994. In the summer of that year,Koskinen's 33-year-old daughter, Kari, wastaken from her New Brighton apartmentand murdered. The suspected killer was thebuilding caretaker, a man with a history ofviolence who later committed suicide. Koskinen went to work at the Capitol the following year in an effort to prevent whathappened to her daughter from happeningagain. The result of Koskinen's efforts was alaw requiring background checks on care-takers. Working to pass that legislation was a learning experience for Koskinen. \"[The law] is the best resolution that ev- erybody can live with,\" she said. \"I think thathelped me realize that no matter what youdo, you've got to hear what other people aresaying and then attempt to make a decision. \"That's what I want to do \u2014 to help make the process such that people's lives are goingto be improved one way or another.\" While working to pass what became known as \"Kari's bill\" shed light on the legislativeNew members . . . Koskinen calls for early help for healthy children process, Koskinen links her decision to seekoffice to another event during the 1995session. That year, Rep. Joel Jacobs (DFL-Coon Rapids), a longtime legislator fromKoskinen's home district, resigned from theHouse to accept an appointment to the Pub-lic Utilities Commission. Koskinen decided to seek the open seat in an April 1995 special election. \"I had very serious conversations with my family and with my friends and I thought,why not?\" she said. \"I have been a politicalworker for many years, and it was just anopportunity that came up. \"The other candidates were candidates with whom I wasn't really that comfortable,and the support of my family and friendsconvinced me that I should run myself.\" Koskinen was defeated in the three-way special election vote won by RepublicanEldon Warkentin of Coon Rapids. But in1996, Koskinen emerged as the winner of arematch race against Warkentin. As she settles into her new role, Koskinen said she is aware that she will be recognizedby many because of what happened to herdaughter. But, she said it is not the basis forher entire political agenda. \"It was a major factor in my life. There's no doubt about that,\" she said. \"But I thinkI bring capabilities that I could have broughtto the Legislature even if my daughter hadn'tbeen murdered. Maybe I would have beenhere now anyway, had that all not happened.\" Aside from her many years of political activism, Koskinen has worked for the past11 years as a business representative forAmerican Federation of State, County andMunicipal Employees (AFSCME) Council14. Earlier she spent a decade on staff forAnoka County as a financial worker and achild support officer. She and her husband, Lauri, a retired school teacher, have four children and fourgrandchildren.Koskinen built her successful House cam- paign around issues she considers essentialto the growing, changing communities sherepresents. As a lawmaker, she aims to im-prove public education, foster safety withincommunities, and help to guide carefulimplementation of welfare reform. She views early childhood programs and education to be keys to helping to alleviatesome of the major problems facing societytoday. \"We should start with the families when the children are infants, give them the kindof experiences that will lead them to becomeproductive citizens, and reserve our prisonspace for violent criminals,\" Koskinen said.\"Each child should have an opportunity togrow up to be a productive citizen.\" Koskinen is optimistic that the promise of bipartisan cooperation can help deliver leg-islation this session that will provide forpositive changes to be made. \"We're going to work very hard to resolve the issues that come before us, and, hope-fully, we can work together in a bipartisanway to do the best we can for the people ofMinnesota.\" \u2014 Nick Healy District 49B area Top concern: \"I think we need to be very careful about how we as a state implementwelfare reform. We need to make sure thatwe exercise care, caution and compassionin how we frame our own welfare systemnow that the federal government seems tobe relegating the states to provide the ser-vices that the federal government did atone point.\" \u2014Rep.

Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) spent part of her childhood kicking around thecampus of a prestigious university, and herexperiences there helped to shape her politi- cal perspective. \"I come from an edu- \"Both par-ents went on tobecome dean of educa-tion at Stanford Univer-sity. So education wasthe subject around our dinner table at home.\" Folliard arrived at the Capitol determined to focus on education, and her appoint-ments to the House Education Committeeand its Higher Education Finance Divisionprovide a springboard for her legislativeagenda. \"I came here number one to work on education. That is the principal impetus forme being here,\" Folliard said. \"I believe thateducation is essential for the maintenance ofour democratic society. I grew up with thatvalue, and the fact that I have three kids inschool right now really brings that valuehome.\" Folliard spent much of her childhood in the San Francisco bay area and went on toattend Stanford, where she received abachelor's degree in drama. She later earneda master's degree in theater at Wayne StateUniversity in Michigan. \"I look at my theater background as excel- lent communications training for life,\"Folliard said. \"You have to be able to handlerejection and that's not bad in the politicalsphere, too.\" She pursued a career in theater in Michi-New members . . . Rooted in education, Folliard focuses on kids gan, Minnesota, and New York before mov-ing to Dublin, where her three children wereborn and the elder two began their school-ing. In Ireland, Folliard was exposed to an education system different from Minnesota'sin many ways. Schools there struggled to get by on \"ex- tremely scarce\" resources, but students re-ceived rigorous instruction on core academicsubjects. Irish students also spend more timein the classroom, with an academic yearsome 40 days longer, and each school day islonger, too. With that experience in mind, Folliard now questions some of the assumptions ofthe status quo in American public educa-tion. She supports efforts to offer new sched-uling options in public schools, such asyear-round programs and extended schoolday models. \"We have to explode our paradigm on the issue of time in school,\" Folliard said. \"Oneway I think the Legislature can do that isthrough providing more incentives to allownew choices in school districts.\" After more than seven years, Folliard and her family left Ireland in 1987, and, she said,came to the Twin Cities for simple reasons. \"I've lived a lot of places, but we deter- mined to settle back in Minnesota because itwas the best place to raise a family,\" Folliardsaid. \"What drew us here was having some ofmy own family here and having a family-friendly place to raise the kids.\" Folliard has lived in Hopkins for the past decade. During that time, she has been activein the community, serving as a member ofthe city's strategic planning committee andwas vice chair of the local PTA. She served onthe Hopkins School Board for the past fiveyears and was its vice chair for two years. She works as a market researcher for VaughnCommunications in Minneapolis. When current state Sen. Steve Kelley (DFL- Hopkins) decided to leave the House andseek a seat in the upper chamber in 1996,Folliard was encouraged by friends and asso-ciates to seek the open House seat. \"I came to the conclusion that I had some- thing to offer, a lot of energy to put forth, anddeep caring for our community and ourquality of life here,\" she said. \"I decided Icould do it, that I could win it, and that I wasthe best person for the job.\" As Folliard settles into her new position, she is immersing herself in the work of hereducation committees and others, includingthe Environment and Natural ResourcesCommittee and the General Legislation,Veterans Affairs and Elections Committee. \"I come here with my naivet\u00e9 intact,\" she said. \"I'm an optimist. I believe that if peopleof goodwill come together for the commongood, you're going to come out with deci-sions that are best for your society.\" \u2014 Nick Healy District 44A 1996 population: 32,777 Largest metropolitan area Top concern: \"My primary goal in education is that we provide a quality education for all kids.We must shore up the cracks and address thebiggest barrier to education, which is poverty.We also must consider it on a systemic level,looking at the problems of housing, jobs, trans-portation, and education as part of a whole.\" \u2014Rep Betty FolliardRep.

Under the currentAFDC welfare program, some parents areallowed to attend college for four years whilestill receiving their monthly welfare check,child care, and health care services. Generally, HF159 limits approved postsecondary or training programs to a yearor less but does allow for up to two years ifthe diploma or degree can be shown to helpthe welfare parent earn a better income andhe or she agrees to pay a portion of themoney back. Income limits \u2014 The bill does set in- come limits on how much a family can earnon the job and still continue to receive amonthly MFIP check. For a family of three, the bill sets a limit of $1,253 a month. A family of three in thecurrent pilot MFIP program, can earn up to$1,554 a month before being cut off. Offi-cials maintain the state couldn't afford thehigher amount if the program goes state-wide. Penalties for counties \u2014 Due to the new federal welfare law, states are under a greatdeal of pressure to move people off the wel-fare rolls and HF159 plans to share thatpressure with counties. Beginning with fiscal year 1997, each state must show that 25 percent of families onwelfare are working at least 20 hours perweek. By fiscal year 2002, that jumps to 50percent working at least 30 hours per week.There are cash penalties for states that do notmeet the percentages. Mirroring the federal law, the bill would penalize counties. Specifically, the bill wouldforce counties to share in the federal penalty. Extra babies \u2014 To discourage women from giving birth to another child while onMFIP, the state would use the family'smonthly grant to directly pay off rent andutilities first before giving the balance to thefamily. New mom exemption \u2014 Although most welfare recipients would be required to work,the bill does allow for certain exemptionssuch as mothers of babies under 12-weeks-old who choose to stay home to care for theirchild. The bill goes on to require those moth-ers to enroll in a parenting or early child-hood development class while exempt fromworking. Residency requirement \u2014 The bill man- dates a 30-day residency requirement to re-ceive welfare and requires that, for the firstyear, families who move to Minnesota re-ceive either the benefit amount they wouldhave received in their previous state, orMinnesota's rate, whichever is less. Welfare bans \u2014 Anyone convicted of felony drug possession would be barred forfive years from receiving welfare, under thebill. Parole violators and felons on the runwould face a lifetime ban. Those convictedof fraudulently attempting to receive ben-efits in two or more states at one time wouldbe barred for 10 years. Kids with behavioral disorders \u2014 The bill would make children with behavioraldisorders who are cut off from the federalSSI program eligible for Minnesota's GAwelfare program. GA, however, will not makeup for the entire federal cut. These childrenaveraged $406 a month while on SSI and GApays out about $203 a month. Drug addicts \u2014 Likewise, the bill would make drug and alcohol addicts who are cutoff from SSI eligible for GA as long as theyare in treatment or on a waiting list. Theyaveraged about $470 a month while on SSI. \u2014 K.

Page 143 March 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . March 20 - 27, 1997 Highlights Many students rely on a good jolt of caf- feine to get them through their first class atPark High School in Cottage Grove, accord-ing to junior Allison Churilla. Park High students begin the school day at 7:35 a.m., and for some, a cup of coffee or acan of Mountain Dew isn't enough to keepthem on their toes. \"A lot of students are asleep in my first class,\" Churilla said, during March 25 testi-mony before the Quality Initiatives Sub-committee of the House EducationCommittee. \"They are much less attentivethan in my second class.\" Staying awake in class is not the only con- cern created by an early start to the schoolday, according to Churilla. Safety is also anissue. Churilla walks to school, and the earlystart often sends her onto the streets wellbefore sunrise. Her classmates who ride thebus often wait in the dark at the bus stop. Churilla urged members of the subcom- mittee to support HF1259 , a bill that would prohibit junior and senior high schools frombeginning classes before 8 a.m. The bill, which was narrowly approved on a voice vote, would require changes in theclass schedules of thousands of students andhundreds of schools across the state. Parents, students, law enforcement offi- cials, and other supporters of the bill claimlater school start times could help to solvemany current problems in and out of theclassroom. But critics of the measure argue such sched- uling decisions ought to be made on the locallevel, and some question whether later start-ing times are really the panacea they aremade out to be. The issue of school start times has been the center of much discussion since the Minne-sota Medical Association (MMA) in April1994 urged all school districts to begin schoollater for teenagers. The medical group reported that adoles- cents need more sleep \u2014 at least 9.5 hoursper night \u2014 than do younger children oradults. At the same time, teenagers experi-ence increasing demands on their time, in-cluding school, jobs, sports, homework, andsocializing. Later school starts . . . Proponents promise attentive students, less crime Also, there is evidence that the timing of adolescents' sleep period is delayed, accord-ing to the MMA. They are unable to fallasleep as early as younger children and adults,and they tend to sleep later. School schedules that send the older stu- dents to school earliest are contrary to whatstudies suggest would be most effective, ac-cording to the MMA. Others see problems caused by earlier start times extending well beyond bleary-eyedhours in the classroom. Students who beginclasses before 8 a.m. are often dismissedshortly after 2 p.m., and that is when thetrouble begins for police officer Lt. John Harrington. \"We see a direct correlation between [school] start time and crime,\" saidHarrington, who runs the juvenile crimeunit of the St. Paul Police Department. Many teenagers are on their own during the afternoon hours. The lack of adult super-vision inevitably allows some teens to runamok after school, and some engage in avariety of criminal activities ranging fromvandalism and shoplifting to more seriousoffenses, Harrington said. \"There is a gap between when latchkey children get out and their parents get home,\"Harrington said. \"A later start time wouldbridge that gap very effectively.\" LeVita Anderson, a St. Paul resident and mother of four, also has concerns about thetime students are dismissed for the day. Herson, a ninth grader, begins class before 8 a.m.and gets out long before she is finished work-ing for the day. \"I live in a neighborhood where things are not so pleasant,\" Anderson said. \"And I'mactually horrified at work because I'm won-dering what's going on.\" Many metropolitan area school districts have studied the issue of school start times in Early school start times means darkness when boarding the bus in the winter months for many students.Proponents of a bill to begin classes after 8 a.m. say that student safety in such circumstances is one reasonthe schedule change should be made. LaVita Anderson, left , told the Education Committee's Quality Initiatives SubcommitteeMarch 25 that later school start times for studentsin junior and senior high school would be a goodidea. She said she worries about her 14-year oldson, Fontaine, right , because of his unsupervised time after school.4 SESSION WEEKLY / March 28, 1997recent years, but only one district, Edina, has moved to a later start. Bill sponsor Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) said his bill would remove some of thecomplications involved with individual dis-tricts changing to a later start time. Cur-rently, schools can run into problems makingthe change if, for example, other schools inthe same athletic conference stick to earlierschedules. \"It's very difficult for individual schools to do this,\" Entenza said. \"It's easier for every-one to jump at the same time.\" Entenza originally proposed that all stu- dents begin classes no earlier than 8 a.m. Heoffered an amendment that would limit theprohibition on early start times to studentsin grades 7-12 because, he said, those are thestudents most adversely affected by earlyschedules. Opposition to the bill focuses on the role of the state in making scheduling decisionsand the potential impact the bill could haveon the budgets of districts across the state. \"If you want to talk about micro- management, you're at the height of it here,\"said Bob Meeks, a lobbyist for the MinnesotaSchool Boards Association. Meeks said the bill may force some dis- tricts to flip-flop schedules, sending elemen-tary students to school earlier and creatingan entirely new set of problems when theyare dismissed earlier in the afternoon. Rep. Barbara Sykora (R-Minnetonka) agreed that the bill would amount to state\"micromanagement\" of local affairs. \"I don't understand why we can't allow local school boards to do this,\" Sykora said.\"If a bunch of parents start calling on schoolboards, they will respond quickly.\" The bill runs contrary to efforts in recent years to reduce legislative mandates on schooldistricts, according to Rep. Becky Kelso(DFL-Shakopee). Kelso said the bill is \"con-descending\" to members of local schoolboards. \"Every good idea doesn't belong in state statute,\" Kelso said. But Entenza, who described the bill as a necessary mandate, said the long-term ben-efits of shifting to later start times for teenag-ers would outweigh the short-termcomplications involved. \"Schools are based on students,\" Entenza said. \"They are not based on busing sched-ules, and they are not based on extra-cur-ricular activities.\" The bill now moves to the full Education Committee. \u2014 Nick HealyAGRICULTURE BUSINESSSALESSlots at the track Installing slot machines at Canterbury Park would help Minnesota's horse breeders, ac-cording to supporters of a bill discussedMarch 21 by the House Agriculture Com-mittee. HF1300 , sponsored by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), would as many as 1,500slot machines at Canterbury Park inShakopee. Profits from the slots would be used to boost purses at the track, and that wouldkeep racing alive and help the state's thor-oughbred industry, according to Holsten. Discussion of the bill focused on its poten- tial impact on horse breeding and other ag-ricultural concerns, but Holsten's proposalalso would provide a new revenue sourcethat could be used to construct a stadium forthe Minnesota Twins. The committee agreed to send the bill without a recommendation to the HouseRegulated Industries and Energy Commit-tee. Under HF1300 , 20 percent of the slot machine proceeds would go to the racetrackand another 8.4 percent would reach breed-ers through increased purses. Among othersources, funds would be devoted to the state'sEnvironmental Trust Fund and to a new\"sports infrastructure fund,\" which wouldprovide unspecified revenue for projects suchas the proposed Twins ballpark. By helping horse breeders, Holsten said, benefits also will reach farmers who sell feedto the breeders and others who provide breed-ers with needed supplies. Several thoroughbred breeders described the dwindling presence of the industry in thestate. As purses have grown richer in otherstates, especially Iowa, breeders have fol-lowed the money out of Minnesota. Purses at Canterbury Park have now dropped to about $4 million annually, com-pared to a peak level of about $10 million inthe late 1980s. Art Eaton, who has about 50 horses on a 200-acre farm in Dakota County, said he hasseen many other breeders get out of thebusiness in recent years, but he has stuckwith it. \"We're hanging on, more or less, by the skin of our teeth,\" Eaton said. It is estimated that slots at Canterbury Park would raise between $50 million and$150 million annually.Cheaper milk Minnesota grocers would be allowed to sell milk at lower prices, under a bill ap-proved March 24 by the House AgricultureCommittee. HF1646 , sponsored by Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul), would temporarily lift cur-rent law forbidding retailers to sell milk forless than they paid for it. The change in milkpricing policy would be in effect for one year. \"Elimination of this artificial and archaic restraint on commerce in milk productionwill invite economic competition, stimulateconsumption, and result in lower prices forconsumers and greater demand for Minne-sota dairy products,\" said Rep. Steve Wenzel(DFL-Little Falls), who chairs the Agricul-ture Committee. Wenzel and other supporters of the bill argue the current law has helped to createhardships for dairy farmers and consumersin the state. Minnesota's dairy farmers have seen the prices they get for their product drop signifi-cantly in recent months, but consumers con-tinue to pay some of the nation's highestretail milk prices. The one-year change in retail pricing regu- lation would allow lawmakers to assess theresults of the bill during the 1998 session. Ifthe Legislature took no action, existing lawsetting a floor for retail milk prices wouldcome back into effect, under the bill. Critics of the bill argue it would only lead to instability in the milk market and wouldnot have a positive effect on the prices paidto dairy farmers. The bill now moves to the Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture FinanceCommittee. Omnibus liquor bill The House Commerce, Tourism and Con- sumer Affairs Committee moved to regulatethe delivery and distribution of alcoholicbeverages March 25, approving nearly adozen new provisions incorporated into anomnibus liquor bill. In addition to providing increased licens- ing capability for a handful of communities,including St. Paul, Moorhead, and Proctor,HF524 , sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy), would prohibit the deliv-ery of alcoholic beverages manufacturedoutside the state to anyplace except a li-censed wholesaler's warehouse. Beveragesjust passing through Minnesota or brought5 March 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY in legally by an individual would enjoy an exemption from the bill's regulatory reach,as would wine collectors, who could con-tinue to receive shipments \u2014 up to two casesper year, per vineyard \u2014 from out-of-statesuppliers. The bill would ban the mailing of letters, postcards, catalogs, or pamphlets intendedto solicit an order for alcoholic beverages fordelivery anywhere except a wholesaler's ware-house. HF524 also consolidates the Department of Public Safety's Division of Liquor Controland Division of Gambling Enforcement intoa single entity, retroactive to Oct. 1, 1996.The department combined the two divisionslast fall in accordance with an executive or-der from Gov. Arne Carlson. CHILDRENMarch madness Recouping child support Recognizing that the millions of dollars in uncollected child support owed to Minne-sota children keeps families on the publicwelfare rolls, a bill moving through the Housewould create a couple of new tools to get atdeadbeat parents. HF925 is a result of the 1996 federal wel- fare law that requires states to adopt certainlaws that make it easier to track down dead-beat parents and collect money. It was ap-proved by the House Health and HumanServices Committee March 25. In fiscal year 1996, of the $376.4 million in child support owed to Minnesota children,only $261 million, or 69 percent, was col-lected, according to the Department of Hu-man Services (bills). Officials estimate thatroughly 90,000 children are not receivingtheir full amount of child support. In recent years, Minnesota has adopted several laws to suspend the driver's licensesand occupational licenses of deadbeat par-ents. Responding to the federal welfare mea-sure, Minnesota is now moving to suspendrecreational licenses, such as those for fish-ing, hunting, boating, and snowmobiling. For now, the bill requires only the DHS to consult with other state agencies to establishjust how to suspend those licenses. Minnesota already has adopted many of the federal welfare law's child support re-quirements. For instance, the state alreadyrequires employers to report new hires to theDHS to match employee data with thosewho owe child support, and ultimately, togarnish wages. Minnesota has already established a cen-tralized child support payment center, which is set to open later this year. And, the state already has adopted the federal Uniform Interstate Family SupportAct (UIFSA) which allows states to collectchild support when the deadbeat parent livesin another state, as long as that state also hasadopted the federal interstate act. A problemarose, however, when a deadbeat parent livedin a state that hadn't adopted the interstatechild support act. The federal welfare lawnow requires all states to adopt UIFSA, whichshould make it easier to collect child supportacross all state lines. Other portions of HF925 , sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) would: Require banks and other financial institu- tions to provide account and asset infor-mation on those owing back child supportand allow for the automated seizure ofbank accounts and assets. Specifically, thebill would require the DHS to come upwith a way to compare bank records withthe records of people who owe back childsupport. The department also would haveto inform the financial industry on how tocomply with the law. The bill gives banks two options. First, the bank could send the state information on allits account holders and rely on the state touse only account information pertaining todeadbeat parents. Or, the bank could re-quest from the state a list of who owes childsupport and match it against its accountholders; forwarding only those names whoare a match. Penalize people on public assistance who do not cooperate with the state to establishpaternity and seek child support. This pro-vision is in keeping with an overall welfare reform bill moving through the Legisla-ture. Cooperation would include provid-ing information about the father,submitting to genetic tests, and appearingfor interviews, hearings, and other legalproceedings. Under the bill, a family on welfare who does not cooperate would lose 25 percent oftheir monthly public assistance check andhave their rent and utilities paid directlythrough the county. Publish a \"most wanted\" list of at least the top 10 deadbeat parents who owe the larg-est amount of money in back child sup-port. Current law includes anyone who is$3,000 behind in payments. Under the bill,the list would be put together by the Officeof the Attorney General in consultationwith the DHS . Current law leaves the listexclusively to DHS . Tap into a deadbeat parent's pension, profit- sharing, and disability benefits to pay forchild support. Under current law, thoseitems are exempt from a creditor's claim. Require jail time for the crime of failure to pay child support and allow work releaseonly if the defendant consents to incomewithholding. Prohibit marriages between people of the same gender and prohibit the recognitionof such marriages in Minnesota even if themarriage occurred in a state that allowspeople of the same gender to marry. (See related story, page 8.) The proposal is an attempt to respond to the possibility that Hawaii may recognizesame-sex marriages and prepare for peoplewho might move to Minnesota from that Goldie Gopher visited the House chamber March 26, prompting an enthusiastic outbreak of theMinnesota Rouser. The U of M's mascot and members of the pep band journeyed to the Capitol todrum up support for the Golden Gophers basketball team, playing this weekend in the Final Four.6 SESSION WEEKLY / March 28, 1997state. Hawaii had passed a law prohibiting same sex marriages, but a lower court ruledthe law unconstitutional. The state has ap-pealed to its state Supreme Court. HF925 now moves to the Health and Hu- man Services Finance Division. Special-needs adoptions A bill to better reimburse li- censed private adoption agencieswho help place children, oftenfrom abusive homes, with newadoptive families has become law. The new law, which will reim- burse agencies up to $16,000 per child, wassigned by Gov. Arne Carlson March 11 andbecame effective March 12, 1997. Under previous law, the Minnesota De- partment of Human Services reimbursedlicensed private adoption agencies a maxi-mum of $4,000 per case and the cap hadn'tincreased since the 1980s. Today, it costsagencies from $8,000 to $13,000 to place asingle child with special needs, according toBob DeNardo, a supervisor in thedepartment's family and children servicesdivision. The previous $4,000 cap discouraged pri- vate agencies, especially the small ones, fromactively seeking families for special needskids because they could not recoup theircosts, said House sponsor Rep. Jim Knoblach(R-St. Cloud). Sen. Martha Robertson (R-Minnetonka) sponsored the measure in theSenate. The adoption reimbursement helps com- pensate the private agency for recruitingfamilies, matching them with the right spe-cial-needs child, and preparing the familyfor the child through education, counseling,and home visits. Special-needs children are part of the Adoption Assistance Program, and in manycases, have been severely neglected or abusedand their parents have relinquished theirparental rights to the state. The child maynot only suffer from physical problems butfrom behavioral, mental, and emotional onesas well. These children often wait in foster care until someone wants them, DeNardo hassaid. Currently, there are 1,700 children who are considered wards of the state. Some arebeing considered by families for adoptionbut nothing has been finalized. As of Janu-ary, however, no one had shown an interestin adopting 813 of those children. Last year, more money was set aside for reimbursement for private adoption agen-Signed by the governorcies, but steps to remove the cap have beendelayed by a departmental rulemaking pro-cedure. The longer state officials waited tomake the change, the greater the risk thatfewer children with special needs would beplaced. The new law is designed to hasten theprocess. (See Feb. 14, 1997, Session Weekly, page 4; Feb. 21, 1997, Session Weekly, page 5; and March 7, 1997, Session Weekly, page 5) HF374/SF274*/CH8 CRIME Crime in the cities \"Our neighborhoods are deteriorating.\" That, according to Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls), is the bottom line. It's also why shesponsored HF1175 , approved by the House Judiciary Committee on March 25. The bill would provide three ways to help communities respond effectively to crime,particularly that caused by chronic offend-ers. \"Residents see a revolving door of misde- meanor offenders,\" Clark told the commit-tee. The police are called, tickets are issued,and the criminals go back to their activities.Clark said that is a common scenario in herneighborhood and one that threatens to de-stroy it. Under the bill, a restorative justice com- ponent would be added to the conditions ofan offender's probation, meaning criminalswould be required to pay the communityback for the suffering they cause. Criminalswould meet with victims and their familiesto discuss the impact of the offense and beassigned an appropriate sanction. Meanswould be sought for reintegrating the of-fender into the community. While the courtsalready have such authority, Clark said shewants to make it clear that they do andencourage them to use it. Dee Tvedt, a south Minneapolis resident who testified in favor of the bill, said thatrestorative justice is a powerful way to re-verse the effects of crime. \"I admit I was askeptic. I thought restorative justice soundedwarm and fuzzy. Instead, I found the pro-grams are working. Victims are empoweredby having a say in the process and by inter-acting with the offender. We've also foundthat offenders are not as likely to repeat theircrimes after serving in a restorative justiceprogram.\" Clark's bill would turn some misdemeanor offenses into gross misdemeanors after asecond offense, including some motor ve-hicle, property, prostitution, and weaponsoffenses, and increase officers' authority to make arrests in those cases. Some drug of-fenses were added to the enhanced-penaltieslist, but only in the cities of Duluth, Minne-apolis, and St. Paul. Those measures, Clarksaid, are intended to slow the revolving doorof the criminal justice system. Finally, Clark said that witnesses are usu- ally left in the dark about the outcome of acomplaint, which also undermines their senseof community and safety. The bill says thatprosecuting authorities will make reason-able efforts to notify witnesses of the out-come of criminal proceedings. Stephanie Glaros, also of Minneapolis, said that new approaches to fighting crime arenecessary. \"I see a lot of fear and frustrationin my neighborhood,\" she said. \"We can allagree the current system isn't working. Weneed to give something new a chance.\" HF1175 will be added to the committee's omnibus anti-crime legislation. Preventing juvenile crime Certain Minnesota cities would receive state grant dollars to help combat teen cur-few violations, truancy, and gang infiltra-tion, under a bill being considered by theHouse Economic Development Finance Di-vision. Committee members heard the bill (HF479 ) March 26 and are considering it for inclusion in the division's omnibus budgetbill. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul), leaves blank the dol-lar amount it is requesting. In 1996, theDepartment of Economic Security receiveda one-time appropriation of $340,000 tofund grants for Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth,and counties containing those cities. Successful amendments expanded the pro- gram to include cities with a population of25,000 or greater and ensured that smallercommunities near the city of Duluth alsocould have access to help. Lt. John Harrington, head of the juvenile division of the St. Paul Police Department,said the bill is crucial to helping cities com-bat a variety of juvenile problems. The St. Paul Attendance Center processed 1,222 juveniles during the 1995-1996 schoolyear. Picking up truants, Harrington pointedout, results in less daytime juvenile crimesuch as purse snatching and vandalism. The Ramsey County Curfew Center opened in June 1996 and has processed 1,102juveniles for violating curfew. That,Harrington said, has resulted in less vandal-ism and fewer personal assaults.7 March 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYLaRue Fields of the Minneapolis Urban League, which runs that city's curfew andtruancy center, said the endeavor is not the\"end all\" but a way to help young people whoneed some guidance in their lives. It also letsthe community know that its troubled youngpeople are not just the responsibility of po-lice. The problem is not restricted to the Twin Cities. Amy Caucutt, a legislative analyst with Olmsted County, explained why Rochesterwould like access to the grant dollars as well.The city, she said, has seen an increase ingangs, which has resulted in street prostitu-tion. Knowing offenders Under an amendment to a bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee March26, victims of juvenile offenders would havean expanded right to learn an offender'sname. \"One of the most basic questions crime victims have is 'Who did this to me?'\" saidSara Schlauderaff of the Department of Pub-lic Safety. \"Under current law, they can't getthat without a court order.\" Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka) is the sponsor of HF147 , which he said is part of anti-gang legislation. The bill says that thename of a juvenile who is the subject of adelinquency petition shall be released to thevictim upon request. Under current law, if the juvenile is 16 or older and the crime is a felony, the city orcounty attorney's office can release the nameto the victim. If the juvenile is 16 and thecharge is a nonfelony, the name can be re-leased only with a court order. If the juvenileis under 16, whether the charge is a felony ornon-felony, the name can be released onlywith a court order. The bill says that \"the name of a juvenile who is the subject of a delinquency petitionshall be released to the victim of the allegeddelinquent act upon the victim's request.\" A broader legislative effort is under way to open all juvenile proceedings and records. HF147 has been added to the committee's omnibus bill. Window peeping The House Judiciary Committee approved a bill March 26 that would elevate from amisdemeanor to a gross misdemeanor thecrime of window peeping when the victim isunder the age of 16. Under current law, the act of surrepti- tiously intruding on the privacy of anotherbecomes a gross misdemeanor after the sec- ond offense. \"Twenty years ago, window peeping was considered a nuisance crime. We didn't takeit seriously. We've learned the hard way thatit is serious,\" said Stephany Good, of theBureau of Criminal Apprehension. Good cited a study showing that 68 per- cent of rapists began their illegal acts withwindow peeping. \"We also learned in a serialsexual assault case that the victims were cho-sen by an offender who had watched them,\"Good said. \"It's still not taken seriously. It's still a misdemeanor,\" she added. \"The bill will also allow judges the discre- tion of keeping a perpetrator out of circula-tion for eight months or beyond,\" said Rep.Bill Macklin (R-Lakeville). \"It is also evi-dence of our view as a Legislature that wetake the crime seriously.\" HF28 will be added to omnibus crime prevention legislation. EDUCATIONSCHOOL Mary Cosentino, left, listened intently as her daughter, Nikki, described for the EducationQuality Initiatives Subcommittee the incidents ofhazing she suffered at the hands of fellow Rosevillearea High School students. The pair testified March25 in favor of a bill that would mandate that eachschool district establish anti-hazing policies.Crusade to stop hazing High school student Nikki Cosentino claims a traditional high school rite of pas-sage turned into a nightmare that forced herout of her school and onto what she calls a\"crusade\" to put a stop to hazing. Her effort brought her to the Capitol March 25 to support a bill that would requireall public school districts and postsecondaryinstitutions to adopt anti-hazing policies. The bill ( HF60 ), sponsored by Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), was approved bythe Quality Initiatives Subcommittee of the House Education Committee. Cosentino was a sophomore at Roseville Area High School in the fall of 1995 when shetook part in an unofficial school traditiondubbed the \"sophomore kidnap.\" The event involves girls from the junior class \"kidnapping\" sophomore girls for anight filled with supposedly harmless, if ob-noxious, activities, including dressing theyounger girls in diapers and other embar-rassments. Nikki's mother, Mary Cosentino, ap- proved of the plan. After all, she had partici-pated in the event in the 1970s when she wasa student at Kellogg High School, a prede-cessor to Roseville High. Back then, it was allsilliness and fun. But the event is much different now, ac- cording to the Cosentinos. When NikkiCosentino was \"kidnapped\" along with morethan a dozen of her classmates, she was sub-jected to a series of dangerous encounters. The younger girls had vinegar poured in their eyes, green dye splashed in their hair,and eggs hurled at their heads. And, accord-ing to Cosentino, some of the girls wereurinated on by older boys from the school. \"The scene was chaotic and scary,\" Cosentino said. \"These were supposed to beour friends.\" All that was bad enough, according to Cosentino. But the real trouble started thefollowing week when she and her motherreported the incident to school officials andto the police. Breaking the \"code of silence\" led to ha- rassment and threats from other girls at theschool that persisted for months even afterCosentino transferred to another school,according to Cosentino and her mother. The Cosentino's house and one of their cars were vandalized and they received deaththreats, Mary Cosentino said. The Cosentinosstill feel unsafe, even after going to court toget restraining orders against two of the girlsinvolved. \"I never leave home without my pager and my cell phone because I'm in constant con-tact with my mother,\" Nikki Cosentino said. The Cosentinos have begun an organized effort to combat hazing. They even haveprinted up brochures that describe hazing asanything from \"requiring any period of si-lence\" to \"causing indecent exposure\" to\"conducting immoral or humiliating games.\" They want criminal penalties specifi- cally addressing hazing, but Greiling's billwould not go that far. The bill would require that the Depart- ment of Children, Families and Learning8 SESSION WEEKLY / March 28, 1997form a model anti-hazing policy and make it available to school districts. Schools would be required to adopt a writ- ten policy that would be included in thestudent handbook and posted in conspicu-ous places in the school. Public post-second-ary institutions would meet similarrequirements. The bill now moves the full Education Committee. School bus/city bus School buses currently share the streets of Minneapolis and St. Paul with their publictransit counterparts. They may soon sharetheir student riders as well. A bill ( HF1372 ) approved by the House Local Government and Metropolitan Af-fairs Committee March 24 calls for a study ofhow public transit buses could be used totake Twin Cities students to school. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls), requires that the MetropolitanCouncil, which runs the public transit sys-tem, consult with the Minneapolis and St.Paul school districts and with an advisoryboard to develop a school transportationplan. The goal would be to transport at least75 percent of Minneapolis and St. Paul ninththrough 12th graders using the public transitsystem during the 1998-1999 school year. The study would not only determine the economic and practical feasibility of usingpublic transit to transport students to school,but just how to do it. Recommendations onstudent fares and legislation needed to makethe switch also would be addressed. The Metropolitan Council and two school districts would be asked to complete thestudy and report back to the Legislature byJan. 30, 1998. The bill now goes to the House floor. ENVIRONMENT Happy trails Aficionados of old western movies know that if you're given 'til sundown to get out ofDodge, you'd best hop the stagecoach to thenext county. You may soon be able to do justthat under a bill to create a 40-mile historictrail through Dodge, Olmsted, and Steelecounties. Under HF1209 , approved by the House Environment and Natural Resources Com-mittee March 24, the Stagecoach Trail wouldoriginate at the Douglas Trail near Roches-ter and extend west along the Zumbro RiverValley to Owatonna. The trail would parallel U.S. Route 14 and pass through Mantorville,Wasioja, and Rice Lake State Park. Bill sponsor Rep. Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon) explained that the multipurposepaved trail would be used primarily for bik-ing and hiking. Unpaved portions of the trailwould be developed for horseback riding,mountain biking, and snowmobiling, Svig-gum said. As yet, no funding has been allo-cated for trail development. The bill now moves to the Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture FinanceCommittee. FAMILY Alex and Brandon Frank Act Most Minnesotans realize that the judicial system isn't perfect, but one woman, AngelaBorg of Brainerd, Minn., knows firsthandhow it can fail. In the midst of a divorce and custody battle last July, Borg's estranged husband,Kurt Frank, murdered their two sons, agesfour and five. A bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee March 26 is intended to helpmend a loophole in current law that mayhave contributed to the tragedy. Failures occurred throughout the couple's separation process, said bill sponsor Rep.Kris Hasskamp (DFL-Crosby). But the worstof them allowed Frank to gain a legal advan- Angela Borg held a photo of her two sons, 4-year-old Brandon and 5-year-old Alex, who weremurdered last summer by her estranged husbandwho was given unsupervised visitation. Shetestified before the House Judiciary CommitteeMarch 21 in support of a bill that would helpprevent such tragedies in the future.Gay marriage ban A move to prohibit same-sex marriages in Minnesota cleared its second legislativehurdle in the House March 25. The ban was added as an amendment last week to a child-support bill ( HF925 ) duringtage by not contesting the order for protec- tion, or restraining order, sought and ob-tained by Borg. In doing so, crucialinformation about his past criminal behav-ior, which led Borg to seek the order, did notget placed in the judicial record. A judgelater awarded Kurt Frank temporary jointcustody of the boys, despite Borg's requestthat he be allowed only supervised visits. Thecustody arrangement prevented police fromintervening at Borg's request on the night ofthe murders. \"When you read the judge's decision, you'll be as appalled as I was. I was dumbstruck. Icould not believe this could happen,\"Hasskamp said, adding that the law givesmore protection to the abuser. \"It protectsthe wrong person.\" HF1031 , which would be called the Alex and Brandon Frank Child Safety Act, saysthat a judge must consider the facts as to whythe individual is seeking the restraining or-der before making a ruling on visitationrights, in cases where a custodial parent hasbeen granted a restraining order and re-quests that the other parent be allowed onlysupervised visitation. As originally introduced, Hasskamp's bill would have made a failure to contest a re-straining order an admission of guilt. It alsowould have said that a restraining orderrequires supervised visitation if the otherparty requests it. \"This is a major life and death issue,\" Hasskamp had said. \"The [person under therestraining order] should prove to the courtsthat they're not a threat to women or chil-dren, or the court can deny visitation. Thebill would close a loophole.\" Hasskamp's bill also establishes a pilot project to improve the courts' resolution offamily issues. Domestic abuse and relatedmatters would be assigned to a single judgeto improve continuity within proceedingsinvolving the same family. The MinnesotaSupreme Court would report on thisprovision's effectiveness by January 2000. HF1031 is expected to be included in the omnibus crime bill. \"Everything that happened could have been avoided,\" Borg told the committee.\"The boys could still be here.\"9 March 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYa March 19 House Judiciary Committee hear- ing. The proposal responds to the possibility that Hawaii may recognize same-sex mar-riages and would affect people who mightmove to Minnesota from that state. Hawaiipassed a law prohibiting same-sex marriages,but a lower court ruled the law unconstitu-tional. An appeal has been filed with the stateSupreme Court, which has not yet issued aruling. Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka), who sponsored the ban, has said the issue is notone of competency, and whether gays can orshould raise children. Instead, the questionis should the state \"sanction different kindsof marriage.\" Current state law defines marriage as a union of two people of different sexes, but itdoes not expressly prohibit same-sex mar-riages. While a few Judiciary Committee mem- bers, including Rep. Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul), spoke strongly against the proposal,calling it an \"unnecessary attack\" on someMinnesotans, the panel approved the amend-ment on a 15-5 vote. Members of the House Health and Hu- man Services Committee March 25 debatedthe child support provisions and approvedHF925 , but did not address the gay marriage issue. HF925 , sponsored by Rep. Mat Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), now moves to the Healthand Human Services Finance Division. Budget proposal House Speaker Phil Carruthers and Majority Leader Ted Winter are surrounded by charts andother House DFL leaders as they announced the House DFL budget plan March 24. GOVERNMENT Signed by the governorSnow removal costs Gov. Arne Carlson signed into law March 19 a bill that spends$20 million to help cities andcounties recoup some of theirweather-related costs from therecord breaking snowfalls of 1997. The funds will be divided into three parts: $6 million to match federal disaster funds inweather-related disaster areas; $3 millionreserved for assistance associated with an-ticipated spring floods; and $11 million to bedistributed to local governments accordingto a formula based on past snow removalexpenses. The law allocates grant money to cities, counties, and towns for recent severeweather-related expenses, mostly snow re-moval costs. The measure, which passed the House on March 13 and the Senate on March 17, alsocontains a $16 million appropriation for state road operations, $95,000 for statetrooper overtime related to winter emergen-cies, and various technical amendments toMinnesota statutes. The new law, which became effective March 20, was sponsored in the House byRep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) and inthe Senate by Sen. Jim Vickerman (DFL-Tracy). Wenzel said that even with state and fed- eral aid, more damage occurred this winterthan cities and towns will be able to pay for. HF100*/SF114/CH12 Legislators as lobbyists A bill approved by the House General Legislation, Veterans Affairs and ElectionsCommittee on March 24 would prohibitformer legislators from lobbying their formercolleagues for one year after leaving office. HF104 , sponsored by Rep. Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), reads: \"For the period of onecalendar year after leaving office, a memberof the legislature may not act as a lobbyist . .. with regard to attempting to influence leg-islative action.\" An amendment to includeformer state agency heads and most legisla-tive staff to the list was added in committee. \"I've been concerned for several years of the apparent coziness of former membersbecoming lobbyists,\" Sviggum said. \"It'sbecoming a standard perception. We, as abody, have to make a statement against it.\" The problem, he explained, is that prior relationships \u2014 often friendships \u2014 be-tween members and lobbyists can interfere\u2014 or at least appear to \u2014 with a legislator'sneutrality. Todd Paulson of Common Cause saidthat the Legislature has become a \"revolving door\" used by legislators and former legisla-tors. \"The public is entitled to send to theLegislature people who will represent theirinterests. [The current situation] blurs theline between public and private interests.\" According to David Schultz, also of Com- mon Cause, 35 states have enacted similarlegislation. Before approving the measure, several members said the bill could go farther andinclude former staff and former executivebranch employees, who make up a largenumber of lobbyists. Sviggum said he is try-ing to keep the bill narrow in scope to im-prove it's chances of success. Two members disagreed with the bill. Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) said it infringeson free speech rights, especially of those wholobby for the common good. \"They're beinggood citizens,\" he said. Rep. Betty McCollum (DFL-North St. Paul) said the bill \"tells constituents theycan't trust legislators\" to use good judg-ment. HF104 now goes to the House Govern- mental Operations Committee. State-paid claims The House voted to expand the authority of state agencies confronting personal injuryor property loss lawsuits March 24, allowingdepartment leaders to settle out-of-courtclaims of up to $7,000. Currently, department heads must ob- serve a $2,500 limit on settlements offered asa result of an injury or loss caused by theaction of a state employee on the job. TheHouse passed HF105/SF85* by a vote of 87- 44.10 SESSION WEEKLY / March 28, 1997The bill, sponsored in the House by Rep. Edgar Olson (DFL-Fosston), also contains ahandful of specific monetary settlements forclaims against the state totaling nearly$60,000, including those for individualsworking jobs in prison or who were fulfillingcommunity service sentences. Rep. Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) charac- terized the bill as non-controversial, for themost part. He did single out an appropria-tion of $24,000 for Braham Area Commu-nity Development, Inc. The agency filed theclaim in connection with the city's failed bidto secure a new state correctional facility.(Braham, Minn., was originally selected asthe site for the prison, but for environmentalreasons, it was moved to Rush City.) Paying the claim, Sviggum said, would set a dangerous precedent. Of the bill's $60,000 worth of claims, nearly $58,000 of that will be paid out of the generalfund, said D'Ann Knight, clerk of the Legis-lative Coordinating Commission's Joint Sub-committee on Claims. The Department ofPublic Safety, Knight said, will pay the re-mainder. \"This is a very small claims bill,\" Knight said. \"Usually they have over $100,000 worthof claims in them.\" HF105/SF85* awaits Gov. Arne Carlson's signature. Eagle center Frank Taylor, curator of birds at the RaptorCenter in St. Paul, holds an American BaldEagle as Mary Rivers, vice president of EagleWatch, testifies before the HouseEnvironment, Natural Resources andAgriculture Finance Committee March 24 forfunding to establish the American Bald EagleCenter in Wabasha, Minn.Ethical open door Future ethics proceedings involving the alleged improprieties of House members willbe more open to the public, under the Per-manent Rules of the House passed March 24.The vote was 121-11. The House rules, largely technical and governing how the lower chamber functionsand operates, address everything from howmembers use the electronic voting system tothe use of offensive words in debate. Alsoincluded: ethics investigations. In the past, complaints referred to the Ethics Committee were private, or held \"inconfidence,\" until a public hearing was sched-uled on the matter. Under the new rules, thevery existence of a complaint, any support-ing materials, and all proceedings of theEthics Committee are presumed to be open.A majority vote of the four-member biparti-san committee could close the proceedingsto determine probable cause, to consider amember's medical or other health records,or to protect someone's privacy (such as achild or third party). The changes stem largely from incidents that occurred during the 1996 session. Inone, Rep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen)made public the existence of an ethics inves-tigation, contrary to House rules. He was immediately removed from the Ethics Com-mittee, but lauded publicly. Under the new rules, recommendations of the committee must be supported by\"clear and convincing evidence,\" andwould then be forwarded to the Housefloor. In the past, ethics determinationswere forwarded to the House Rules andLegislative Administration Committee, apanel without an equal balance of DFLersand Republicans, which could amend orreject the ethics panel's recommendationsbefore they were forwarded to the fullHouse. Previous rules referred only to complaints \"regarding a member's conduct.\" The newrules specifically address conduct \"that be-trays the public trust or that tends to bringthe House into dishonor or disrepute,\" inaddition to violating rules or policies of theHouse. Also adopted was an amendment prohib- iting employees from campaigning duringwork hours and using House equipment forsuch purposes. It also states that House em- ployees cannot be made to assist in cam-paign activities as a condition of employment.The change comes in the wake of a lawsuit(later dismissed) brought by a Senate em-ployee who claimed she was forced to per-form campaign duties within the StateCapitol on state time. HIGHER EDUCATION Higher education direction Should the state be closely involved in setting the direction for Minnesota's col-leges and universities in the coming decades?Or should the institutions be given a chanceto set it themselves? That was the focus of a recent discussion before the House Education Committee'sHigher Education Finance Division. In re-cent years, the Legislature has worked toincrease coordination between the state'sinstitutions of higher learning, creating in1995 Minnesota State Colleges and Univer-sities (MnSCU), a coordinating body be-tween all state higher learning facilities exceptthe University of Minnesota (U of M). Sincethen, MnSCU, the U of M, and the state'sprivate colleges have begun to coordinatesome operations and plan initiatives together. HF304 , sponsored by Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud), would set up a commis-sion to develop a master plan for highereducation in Minnesota. The commissionwould consist of legislators, governor ap-pointees, MnSCU and U of M representa-tives, and students. \"I'm concerned that we lack a statewide plan for higher education,\" Opatz told thecommittee. \"We've seen the U of M andMnSCU engage in strategic planning, as haveother institutions. But we have no idea oftheir mission or focus. We don't have a planthat incorporates all those plans.\" But Ray Cross, president of Northwest Technical Institute, said the bill should beput on hold. \"The committee should give usa chance to work through some of our stra-tegic plans over the next two years. If wecan't do a good job, then I support thislegislation,\" he said. \"We're overloaded withplanning activities, as are MnSCU and the Uof M.\" \"I'd like to reach a steady state before getting into another round of strategic plan-ning,\" said MnSCU's Bill Ulland. Marvin Marshak, of the U of M, said he'd prefer to see the state direct the existingboards of MnSCU and the U of M, ratherthan create a third body.11 March 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYOpatz said the commission would not duplicate efforts and agreed that oversight ofexisting boards might be a way to provide astatewide focus. But Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) said that the commission is a good idea. \"Wedon't want to have all the institutions comein with agendas and secret scenarios. That'swhat creates conflict between the systemsand the Legislature,\" she said. \"I thoroughlysupport this bill. It's exactly what I'm look-ing for.\" HF304 will be considered for inclusion in the committee's omnibus bill to be voted onlater this session. Need a copy of a bill? Call the Chief Clerks Office at (612) 296-2314HUMAN SERVICES HOUSINGCollege savings boost The House Education Committee ap- proved a bill March 25 that would set aside$30 million for EdVest, a plan that encour-ages families to save for college. The pro-gram provides a savings account forlow-income students to help pay forpostsecondary education. HF375 , sponsored by Rep. Hilda Bettermann (R-Brandon), would offer fami-lies two choices. In the first, families coulddeduct up to $2,000 from their taxable in-come for investing the same amount inEdVest accounts. The earnings on the ac-counts would be exempt from state taxes,and could result in a maximum tax benefit of$170 per year. The second option is the state matching grant program, in which earnings on theaccounts are deferred under both federaland state income taxes, and the state makesa matching contribution to the accounts. The state's matching grant would equal 15 percent of the family's contributions for eachbeneficiary (the child and future student).Like the income tax subtraction option, fami-lies could contribute up to $2,000 per year,per beneficiary. Both federal and state in-come taxes would be deferred on the ac-count earnings. The maximum matchingbenefit would be $300 per beneficiary. The program would encourage matching contributions from individuals, foundations,and businesses to provide additional grantsto participating students. HF375 now heads to the House Taxes Committee.Rural residency Seven years ago, the state began a program to encourage physicians to practice in ruralcommunities. Many such areas sufferedshortages or a complete absence of physi-cians. The program pays off medical schoolloans up to $40,000 in exchange for a com-mitment to work in rural communities. A bill ( HF1385 ) sponsored by Rep. Hilda Bettermann (R-Brandon) 24 by the House EducationCommittee's Higher Education FinanceDivision, is designed to make the programmore effective. \"It is vital to get residents and physicians into our rural areas,\" Bettermann said. The bill would allow the Rural Physician Loan Forgiveness Programs to exclusivelyrecruit residents instead of a combination ofstudents and residents. Current law allows for the selection of 12 participants annually; eight medical residentsand four fourth-year medical students, ac-cording to the Minnesota Department ofHealth. However, selection of medical stu-dents in their fourth year offers no immedi-ate financial advantage to the students andcreates a three- to five-year funding gap forthe department. Once a student has agreed to be part of the program, explained Wayne Carlson, of thehealth department, he or she may often spendseveral years in a residency program beforepracticing in the rural area. In fact, partici-pants have up to six years after joining theprogram before they must go to the ruralarea. During this time, departmental moneyis earmarked and can't be used for otherpurposes, Carlson said. \"We have an average three-year wait for a student,\" said Carlson. \"The wait is only sixmonths for a resident. The bill allows us toget physicians into the community muchmore quickly.\" HF1385 now heads for the House Educa- tion Committee. Emergency calls allowed Tenants would be able to call the police for emergency assistance without fear of retali-ation from their landlords under a bill ap-proved by the House Economic Developmentand International Trade Committee's Hous-ing and Housing Finance DivisionMarch 25. HF686 , sponsored by Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul), would prohibit rentallease provisions that bar or limit tenant calls for police or emergency assistance or penal-ize tenants for making such calls. Landlords often impose such provisions in response to local ordinances which re-quire tenants to be evicted after a specifiednumber of emergency police calls. The billalso would prohibit such local ordinances,which were often enacted to combat drugdealers. The proposal would not affect locallaws requiring landlords to stop nuisance ordisorderly conduct on their rental property. Paymar told the committee that the state attorney general's office has received reportsof landlords threatening domestic abuse vic-tims with eviction if they continue callingthe police. \"This situation needs to bechanged,\" Paymar said. The bill now moves to the House floor.(See March 14, 1997, Session Weekly , page 6.) Welfare proposal advances A welfare bill that, so far, contains no specific appropriations but promises to spend$733 million in both state and federal dollarsover the 1998-1999 budgeting period is onits way to the House floor. The House Ways and Means Committee March 25 approved SF1* /HF159 , sponsored by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris). The bill uses Minnesota dollars to make up for some of the federal cuts to legal immi-grants, requires families on welfare to workor be penalized, and discourages welfaremoms from having another child while onpublic assistance. The bill spends about $22.2 million more over the two-year budgeting period thanGov. Arne Carlson's welfare proposal andabout $27 million less than the Senate's. Overall, the bill would expand statewide an experimental welfare-to-work programoperating in a handful of Minnesota coun-ties over the past two years. The MinnesotaFamily Investment Program (MFIP) wouldbecome permanent Jan. 1, 1998, in all 87Minnesota counties. MFIP allows families to accept lower-pay- ing jobs while receiving some public assis-tance such as extra monthly cash andsubsidized child and health care. In theory,allowing someone to work while still receiv-ing benefits helps a low-skilled parent gainwork experience and eventually obtain abetter job. MFIP statewide would replace the tradi- tional Aid to Families with Dependent Chil-12 SESSION WEEKLY / March 28, 1997 Welfare protest Welfare rights advocates marched away from the State Office Building after their entrance was barred March 25.

And, in keepingwith federal law, the bill sets a five-year,lifetime limit on receiving MFIP welfarechecks. Money for SF1* /HF159 is expected to be incorporated into the omnibus Health andHuman Services budget bill later this ses-sion. Money for the increased demand forchild care as a result of welfare moms anddads going to work is expected in a budgetbill from the Family and Early ChildhoodEducation Finance Division. States across the country are hurrying to pass new welfare laws after the federal gov-ernment scrapped the long-standing welfaresystem in August 1996. (See Jan. 24, 1997, Session Weekly, page 9; Feb. 7, 1997, Session Weekly, page 3 and page 12; March 7, 1997, Session Weekly, page 17; and March 21, 1997, Session Weekly, page 15.) Return of the phone wars Two bills approved March 20 by the House Regulated Industries and Energy Commit-tee would mean big changes to telecommu-nications companies in Minnesota. Current law separates long-distance tele- phone service providers and local serviceproviders. That's part of the arrangementestablished after the Bell Systems breakup inthe early 1980s. Minnesota is divided intofive long-distance areas (LATAs), through-out which long-distance companies com-pete to provide service. Local serviceproviders, such as US West, can provide long-distance service within a single LATA,in addition to providing local service. House files 1171 and 1172 , sponsored by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), wouldchange that, making the state one large LATAand allowing US West and other local serviceproviders to provide long-distance servicethroughout the state. The bills, Jennings said, anticipate changes called for by the 1996 Federal Telecommu-nications Act, which will allow long-distancecompanies to begin offering local service,and local companies to provide extendedlong-distance service. The proposals are de-signed to help local companies compete oneven footing with nationwide long-distanceproviders when the federal changes are infull effect. Long-distance companies say that the bills are unfair and illegal. According to TeresaLynch, of AT&T, the bills ignore many of thefederal act's limitations and give local ser-vice providers, who currently enjoy a mo-nopoly in their service areas, a competitiveadvantage. Jennings' proposals would allowlocal providers to get into the marketprematurely, she said. Jennings believes the long-distance com- panies will be better positioned to enter localmarkets than the locals will to enter the long-distance market. Under the bills, he said,competition will be equitable. \"I'm trying tocollapse the time frame,\" he said, and givelocal providers a foothold in Minnesota'slong-distance industry at the same time thelocal market is open to competition. That violates the law, Lynch said. \"The federal act says you can't have that edge,\"and lays out how and when competition should take place, with the Public UtilitiesCommission (PUC) serving as overseer. \"Wefeel the state has no authority to changeLATA boundaries. It is clearly contrary tothe federal act and seeks to bypass [provi-sions] that address a [local operator's] au-thority to enter the inter-LATA market,\"Lynch said. Jennings cited federal act provisions that say otherwise, specifically that a state canchange LATAs when it would be \"pro-com-petitive and otherwise in the public inter-est.\" He also said his bill providesconsumer-friendly safeguards for when fullcompetition is in effect. For instance, localservice providers must not exclude residen-tial customers in order to focus on morelucrative commercial accounts, and mustcharge all customers \u2014 rural and urban \u2014the same rate for basic service. AT&T's list of objections also says that the bills \"immediately deregulate most, if notall, of US West's monopoly services by al-lowing the company to 'repackage' existingservices in the guise of 'new services.'\" Fur-ther, they said, the bills would keep intrast-ate long distance rates for AT&T and othercarriers artificially high, and would allowlocal provider US West to charge inflatedprices when long distance companies haveto interconnect with them. (Competing com-panies routinely share networks and tech-nology as a matter of necessity due to thenature of telephone technology). The com-pany also says the bills would repeal con-sumer protections, and weaken the authorityof the PUC. Ultimately, Jennings said, the legislation will make telephone service more competi-tive and save consumers money. HF1171 and HF1172 now move to the House floor. INSURANCEINSURANCE Snowmobile insurance A bill that would require all snowmobile owners to carry liability insurance was ap-proved March 26 by the House FinancialInstitutions and Insurance Committee. HF406 , sponsored by Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison), calls for a number ofchanges in state law in response to the mount-ing death toll involving snowmobile acci-dents this winter. Minnesota has suffered a spate of snow- mobile-related accidents this winter, claim-ing the lives 32 snowmobilers and bystanders.13 March 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY LABORPeterson's bill prescribes a series of new measures to prevent such a death toll in thefuture. The bill would mandate that all snowmobilers take a state-approved safetycourse before they can ride. (Current lawrequires only those under 18 to take suchtraining.) And the bill would reduce thenighttime speed limit for snowmobiles fromthe current 50 miles per hour to 40 miles perhour. The bill also would double the snowmo- bile registration fee \u2014 from $30 to $60 everythree years \u2014 for machines with engineslarger than 335 cubic centimeters. The in-creased revenue would be used to improvestate snowmobile trails. Debate in the committee focused on pro- visions related to insurance. The bill wouldrequire snowmobile owners to purchase aminimum of $60,000 in liability insurance.Failure to comply would result in misde-meanor charges and revocation of theowner's snowmobile registration for 60 daysduring the winter season. \"Even the safest, most experienced rider can encounter conditions where he or shemay lose control and cause injury to anotherperson,\" Peterson said. \"I would feel im-mensely more comfortable knowing that theother people on the trail were covered.\" The bill also drew support from the fami- lies of some killed in snowmobile-relatedaccidents this year. Lori Renken's 10-year-old son was killed in January by a passing snowmobiler on thestreet in front of his home in Big Lake, Minn.,she said her family's problems have beencompounded because the 20-year-old manwho hit her son did not have insurance. In addition to dealing with the loss of her son, Renken has had to absorb financiallosses stemming from the incident, includ-ing funeral expenses. \"It's not fair,\" Renken said. \"I shouldn't to pay for my I'm alreadypaying enough.\" The Minnesota United Snowmobilers As- sociation offered support for most provi-sions of the bill but opposed the plan torequire snowmobilers to buy insurance. Doug Franzen, a lobbyist for the group, said the insurance requirements would betoo costly and would not reach the problemsnowmobilers. The riders who pose the mostserious danger on the trails most likely wouldignore the requirement, he said. \"Frankly, liability insurance will not prevent these sorts of tragedies,\" Franzensaid. \"We want to focus all of our resourceson prevention.\"Peterson said the insurance would likely cost snowmobile owners less than $30 a year,but the snowmobile group official said theinsurance could cost as much as $200 a year. The bill now moves to the House Environ- ment, Natural Resources and AgricultureFinance Committee. Preventing homelessness Daisy Barton, of Eden Prairie, with daughter Risikat, left, and son Kiante, went before the Family and Early Childhood Education Finance Division March 24. Barton, who was once homeless,testified in support of a bill that would establish an emergency services grant program to preventhomelessness and more efficiently get people out of shelters and into transitional and permanenthousing.Employment contracts The need for a bill requiring written em- ployment agreements in the employee's na-tive language was underscored by testimonybefore the House LaborManagement Rela-tions Committee March 24. Speaking through an interpreter, Manuel Torres told the panel that in February he andseven other Mexicans were recruited in At-lanta to work for a janitorial service in Min-nesota. They were promised $1,200 a monthplus housing, food, and warm clothing inexchange for working eight-hour shifts, sixdays per week. \"Instead, we worked 11 hours per day and seven days per week,\" Torres said. \"We wereliving nine to a room and fed one hamburgerevery 24 hours. We were locked in andcouldn't leave. When we complained, theybeat us. . . . In the end, we never were paid.\" As Torres tearfully ended his testimony, Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) com-mented, \"I thought indentured country.\" HF216 , sponsored by Rep. Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul), has already been laid overuntil next year because of concerns that it would be an unmanageable burden to em-ployers. But Mariani asked for a hearingbecause Torres and his fellow workers donot plan to stay in Minnesota much longer.The testimony prompted several lawmakersto pledge support for the bill next year. Margarita Zalamea, executive director of the Chicano-Latino Affairs Council, urgedthe Legislature to support the bill. Remind-ing the panel of a 1995 settlement againstMinneapolis-based meat processor GFIAmerica, Zalamea said, \"There has been ahistory of such abuses in Minnesota.\" Protecting contract workers The House Judiciary Committee approved a bill March 26 that would protect contractworkers from workplace discrimination. HF787 would add such discrimination to the list of unfair employment practices incurrent law. As contract work becomes morecommon, so are the acts of discrimination. \"It's happening more and more,\" said Rep. Bill Hilty (DFL-Finlayson), the bill's spon-sor. \"It's becoming a common work situa-tion.\" A typical scenario would involve a tempo- rary worker directed to a business. Becausethe worker isn't officially an employee of thebusiness where the discrimination took place,the business could claim it is not respon-sible. \"After the discriminatory act happens, it's not clear who is responsible. The [hiringcompany] says [the person is] 'not our em-14 SESSION WEEKLY / March 28, 1997LAW Signed by the governorployee.' The contracting company says it'snot their responsibility,\" Hilty said. The bill says it is illegal to discriminate against anyone in an employer's workplacewho is providing services according to anagreement with the employer. \"The bill makes it clear that the responsi- bility is with the business where the dis-criminatory act took place.\" HF787 now heads to the House floor. Underage ID Effective Aug. 1, 1997, a new state law will clearly mark stateidentification cards for peopleunder the legal drinking age. Gov. Arne Carlson signed a bill March 19 that will require state identification cards for people under 21 yearsold to include markings similar to driver'slicenses for that age group. Under the new law, identification cards for people under the legal drinking age willbe a distinguishing color and labeled \"Un-der-21.\" The cards will expire on the holder's21st birthday. Minnesota identification cards, which pro- vide a form of legal identification for non-drivers, are issued by the Department ofPublic Safety. There is a $12.50 fee, and cardsfor people under 65 years old are normallyvalid for four years. Senior citizens are issuedcards that do not expire. Rep. Peggy Leppik (R-Golden Valley) and Sen. Martha Robertson (R-Minnetonka)sponsored the legislation. HF40/SF129*/CH13 LOCAL GOVERNMENT METRO AFFAIRSChilling public participation A bill that protects citizens from frivolous lawsuits won approval from the House Judi-ciary Committee March 24. They're called SLAPP suits, for strategic litigation against public participation. A fewyears ago, it came to the attention of courtsand lawmakers that some parties \u2014 usuallycommercial interests \u2014 were using the courtsto effectively deny others \u2014 usually privatecitizens or citizen groups \u2014 their right tofree speech. In such a scenario, a developer proposing to build a garbage dump encounters protestsfrom local citizens. He sues them, possiblyfor defamation. The suit will very likely fail in court, bill sponsor Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls)said. \"But the minute the citizens spend their first dollar having to defend themselves,they've lost.\" Worse, he said, the threat oflawsuits will have a chilling effect on publicparticipation. In 1994, the Legislature passed a law to protect against SLAPP suits, requiring de-velopers or others filing the legal action toprove that they had been harmed by theperson or people whose words or actionswere at issue. If developers could not, such alawsuit was to be dismissed. But some have avoided the law by suing in federal rather than state court. HF642 , approved by the committee, would address that problem. The bill allows anaction for damages and attorney fees in statecourt against someone who sues an indi-vidual in federal court in a SLAPP suit. Thebill says: \"If the person demonstrates thatthe respondent's action in federal court wasbrought for the purpose of harassment, toinhibit the person's public participation, tointerfere with the person's exercise pro-tected shallaward step Skoglund said. says you can't do itin federal court either.\" HF642 now heads for the House floor. Mesabi County? In the Civil War, it was the South that tried to secede from the Union. But in Minnesota'sSt. Louis County, the rebels are northernersfrom the Iron Range and they want a newcounty. Nothing ticks off citizens like taxes, and in northern Minnesota, they may split a countyover it. The debate centers around St. Louis County, Minnesota's largest. Duluth, a largeurban center, sits in the southwest corner,but the Iron Range stretches across much ofit. A bill sponsored by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) would let voters decide in1998 whether to cut off the northern three-fourths of St. Louis County and form a newcounty. \"We might call it Mesabi County,\"Rukavina said. Rukavina said that although the Iron Range has 41 percent of the county's population, itpays 49 percent of county taxes and receivesonly 35 percent of the county's spending. \"This is a question of democracy and equal representation,\" said Rukavina. \"It goes backto the Biblical expression, 'Let my peoplego.'\" A new county seat would be established in Buhl, which Rukavina called a neutral sitebetween the two larger towns of Hibbingand Virginia. The courthouses in those twotowns would continue to be maintained, hesaid. The measure ( HF698 ) was approved by the House Local Government and Metro-politan Affairs Committee March 25. The idea of splitting St.Louis County has been around for more than a hundred years,Rukavina told the committee He handed out copies of an article from the St. Louis County Journal of March 1, 1888. \"It seems to be the general opinionwith all Vermillion mining men that St. LouisCounty is too large and that it ought to bedivided,\" the article began. The matter has been discussed ever since, Rukavina said. The last time the voters spokein 1954, however, they rejected a move tosplit the county. A 1974 study concludedthat such a split was feasible but pointed outthat it would have more advantages for theIron Range than for Duluth. Another studywas authorized last year by the St. LouisCounty Board. At 6,092 square miles, St. Louis County is the largest county in the nation east of theMississippi River. With 198,212 people, it isthe fifth most populous county in the state.St. Louis County stretches more than 125miles from the Canadian to the Wisconsinborder. John Garland, director of government re- lations for St. Louis County, urged the com-mittee to hold off on the bill until the countycompletes its study of the matter. \"We feelthat to pass this measure now will politicizethe study and its outcome,\" Garland said. HF698 will go to the House Floor. Met Council survives The Metropolitan Council has a new lease on life, albeit a one-year lease. A proposal toabolish the council has stalled in the HouseTransportation and Transit Committee. Members of the committee March 24 de- cided to lay over the bill ( HF783 ) for study during the interim. The committee took theaction with the intention to bring the pro-posal back for debate during the 1998 legis-lative session. Bill sponsor Rep. Peg Larsen (R-Lake- land) described her bill as a work in progressand did not resist the move to delay actionon the measure. However, she argued the15 March 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYSPORTSTAXES $Metropolitan Council has expanded far be- yond its original mission and that lawmak-ers need to consider the necessity of such anentity. \"There is very little accountability for how the tax dollars are spent\" by the council,Larsen said. Created in 1967, the Metropolitan Coun- cil includes a chairperson and 16 other mem-bers (representing different portions of themetro area), all of whom are appointed bythe governor. The council is responsible forcomprehensive regional planning in the TwinCities area. The council oversees regional transit sys- tems, wastewater treatment facilities, regionalparks, and other initiatives. It manages about3,500 employees and functions on an annualbudget of about $360 million, which is de-rived in part from property taxes. Criticism of the council has focused on its far-reaching programs and authority overlocal government units more closely linkedto their constituents. The transportation committee also heard a spirited defense of the Metropolitan Coun-cil from current and former members of thebody and others who see value in regionalgovernment efforts. Lyle Wray, executive director of the Citizen's League, said many of the challengesfacing individual cities in the metro area arebest addressed on the regional level. He cautioned against disassembling the council at a time when other urban regionsthroughout the country are struggling tocreate methods to deal with regional issues. \"In the world economy, the region is where the action is,\" Wray said. \"Regions will haveto work together to do well.\" Larsen said taking time to study the issue will allow lawmakers to decide if regionalgovernment is necessary and, if so, whatform it should take. (See March 21, 1997,Session Weekly, page 12.) Electing the Met Council A bill that would transform the Metro- politan Council into an elective body wonapproval from the House General Legisla-tion, Veterans Affairs, and Elections Com-mittee on March 24. The Metropolitan Council, created in 1967, is responsible for comprehensive re-gional planning for the seven-county metro-politan area. One of the largest regionalgovernments in the nation, it also oversees:the regional bus system; several waste watertreatment facilities; and Metro Mobility, atransit operation serving the disabled. It over-sees an annual budget of about $360 million, which is partially paid by property taxes, andmanages about 3,500 employees. The coun-cil is governed by a board of 17 membersappointed by the governor, each represent-ing a different portion of the metro region. \"The Metropolitan Council is the second largest unit of local government in the state,\"after Hennepin County, said Rep. MyronOrfield (DFL-Mpls), the bill's sponsor. Hesaid that when an official body has as muchauthority as the council, it should be andusually is elected. \"When you're going tolevy that kind of money, the people shouldhave a right to elect the officers. Taxationwithout representation is fundamentallycontrary to our constitution.\" But Bill Schreiber, a Metropolitan Coun- cil member from the second district, saidthat the council only levies as directed by theLegislature. \"We view ourselves an arm ofthe Legislature,\" Schreiber said, adding thatthe committee should consider the role itwants to play in local governance. An electedMetropolitan Council would lead to divi-siveness and more government, he said. Schreiber added that the council has not taken a formal stand on the bill, but believesmost members are opposed to it. HF423 \"moves to the intent of the original framers of the Metropolitan Council in1967,\" Orfield said at a previous meeting.\"They believed that the council should beelected. That prevailed in the House butfailed on a tie vote in the Senate in 1967.\" Council elections would be nonpartisan and public funding provided for qualifiedcandidates. Salaries of council memberswould not change. HF423 now moves to the House Floor. (See March 21, 1997, Session Weekly, page 12.) State high school league A proposal to increase legislative over- sight of the Minnesota State High SchoolLeague was rejected March 26 by the HouseEducation Committee. HF747 , sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), drew opposition from theleague, a nonprofit organization that regu-lates athletics and other extra-curricular ac-tivities for public and private high schoolsthroughout the state, and from committeemembers who are satisfied with the league'strack record. \"Although nobody ever likes to see a planecrash, this is one 747 that should never take off,\" said Rep. David Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm), who added that he has receivedno complaints about the league but has heardfrom plenty of people opposed to Kahn'sbill. Kahn described the league as a body that has the authority of a state agency and func-tions on public dollars (received via schooldistricts) but is subject to none of the over-sight required for government agencies. She raised questions about the overall per- formance of the league and about the salariesof some of its top officers, who earn morethan the commissioners of some state de-partments. \"This attitude that the league is above the law and that it has complete autonomy iscompletely unacceptable,\" Kahn , whose billhas the backing of Gov. Arne Carlson, said. The bill calls for the league's budget to be submitted to the Legislature for approval, asis the case with other state agencies. Education Committee members deleted a provision in the bill that would have re-quired the governor to appoint the league'spresident, and the committee later rejectedthe entire bill on a voice vote. The league's defenders included its board members and school officials who haveworked closely with the league. Len Olson, a teacher and basketball coach at Owatonna High School, said the leaguehas a history of success in guiding high schoolathletics in the state. \"The high school league is free of political pressures. It is administrated honestly,\"Olson said. \". . . They have done things thecorrect way.\" (See March 21, 1997, Session Weekly, page 12.) Tightening TIF regulation Rep. Dennis Ozment (R-Rosemount) and Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) pre-sented a bill March 26 to the House TaxesCommittee that would increase the amountof regulation surrounding the use of TaxIncrement Financing (TIF) throughout Min-nesota. \"We recognize that Tax Increment Financing is a valuable developmenttool . . . [but] when TIF money is spent it's really liketaking money from schools,\" Ozment said.HF1574 , he continued, would prevent com- munities from abusing the tax incrementprocess. The panel did not vote on themeasure.16 SESSION WEEKLY / March 28, 1997Minnesota communities use Tax Incre- ment Financing to fund economic develop-ment and other public improvement projectswith property tax dollars. A city or a towncreates a TIF district for a certain period oftime \u2014 usually 20 years \u2014 and effectivelyfreezes the property tax rates within that areaat what is called the \"original tax capacity.\" As development within the TIF district progresses and the value of the propertyclimbs, the property taxes paid over andabove the original tax capacity \u2014 the \"incre-ment\" in Tax Increment Financing \u2014 is\"captured\" by the municipality to cover de-velopment costs. Ultimately, tax dollars thatwould ordinarily flow through to the countyand school districts to pay for education are,in effect, spent on economic development. And some of the economic development, Ozment said, is dubious, at best. Indeed, aMarch 1996 report from the Office of theLegislative Auditor documents years of taxincrement abuse. According to the report, communities can use TIF dollars for a strictly defined list ofscenarios: redevelopment, renewal and reno-vation, soil conditioning, housing, economicdevelopment, mined underground spacedevelopment, and hazardous substancecleanup. Despite the fact that the Legislature has moved to regulate TIF five times since 1979,some communities continue to misuse thesystem, either by using tax increment dollarsto fund projects that don't meet the \"but-for\" test (which states the use of a TIF districtwould increase the taxable market value of asite over what would have occurred withoutTIF), or by failing to decertify their TIFdistricts after the development has been com-pleted. Before any project can go ahead,Ozment pointed out, current law says it mustmeet the \"but-for\" test HF1574 , Ozment said, would require de- velopers to document that a new project, oradditional spending in an existing TIF dis-trict, meets the but-for test. Increment dol-lars unspent upon decertification of a districtwould have to be returned to the city, county,and school district. A district that went threeyears without any development activitywould automatically be decertified. In addition, HF1574 explicitly defines tax increment terminology and details the spend-ing restrictions to which redevelopment dis-tricts are subject. The committee will hear further testimony on the bill at a later date.Technology agency A bill heard by the State Government Fi- nance Division March 26 would elevate theMinnesota Office of Technology from a di-vision of the Department of Children, Fami-lies and Learning to an independent stateagency within the executive branch. The idea behind the proposal ( HF120 ), said bill sponsor Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), is to create a strong measure of ac-countability in light of the increased numberof technology initiatives currently before theLegislature. As things now stand, Kahn said,the responsibility for decisions concerningtechnology is scattered among several differ-ent state agencies, with much of it lying inthe Department of Administration. \"We're just setting a clear line of author- ity,\" for decisions, Kahn said. \"The authorityis within the Office of Technology.\" If Hf120 wins approval, the office's execu- tive director would be charged with review-ing and coordinating state andintergovernmental information systems andthe entire technology infrastructure. Thetechnology office would also develop, in con-junction with an advisory council, a plan toprovide access to information gathered bythe government. Under the bill, the technology director would have full power to approve the newagency's contracts \u2014 including bids for hard-ware, software, and services. These contracts,along with any other competitive bid pro-cess, currently exist under the Departmentof Administration. Perhaps most importantly, Kahn said, the technology director would have the powerto delegate responsibility for the office's ac-tivities to other state agencies. Gov. Arne Carlson created the Office of Technology in May 1996 by executive order,said Michael Norton, the office's deputy di-rector, placing it in the Department of Chil-dren, Families and Learning. \"It was created there mainly because the lion's share of the investments in technologyare in the area of education,\" said Norton,who did not testify at the meeting. The measure has support from both sides of the aisle. Rep. Bruce Anderson (R-BuffaloTownship) said the Republican caucus be-lieves in HF120 . Several other Republican members also expressed their approval. \"Remember, what we're talking about spending on technology is roughly equiva-lent to building a baseball stadium,\" has tosteer the ship.\" The committee declined to act on the bill until it hears more testimony from the af-fected state agencies. TRANSPORTATION Snowmobile safety Two bills designed to improve snowmo- bile safety were approved March 26 by theHouse Transportation and Transit Com-mittee. Minnesota has seen a rash of fatal snow- mobile accidents this year; a total of 32 peoplehave died. Both bills approved by the committee would increase snowmobile registration fees,but the proposals prescribe a variety of mea-sures to address safety concerns. HF770 , sponsored by Rep. Kris Hasskamp theJoshua Renken and Stacy Schlosser Snow-mobile Safety Act in honor of two Minne-sota youths who died after being struck bysnowmobiles this season. Under the bill, anyone born after 1950 would be required to complete a trainingcourse to gain a safety certificate to operate asnowmobile. The nighttime speed limit for snowmo- biles would be reduced from 50 miles perhour to 30 miles per hour, and municipali-ties would be allowed to set speed limits fortraveling alongside roads or highways of upto 10 miles per hour lower than the postedlimit for automobile traffic. Anyone without a valid driver's license would be barred from operating a snowmo-bile with an engine larger than 440 cubiccentimeters, under Hasskamp's proposal. The bill also would double registration fees to $60 for three years and apply a newfunding formula to dictate allocations fromthe state's snowmobile trails and enforce-ment account. Funds from the account would be divided as follows: 50 percent for state grants to localsnowmobile clubs for trail maintenance, 25percent to maintain the state's own trails,and 25 percent for enforcement of snowmo-bile laws. HF407 , sponsored by Rep. Tom Bakk (DFL-Cook), focuses on generating increasedrevenue for snowmobile trail improvementsand maintenance and for enforcement ofsnowmobile laws. Continued on page 1717 March 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Rep. Joe Mullery (DFL-Mpls) may be a newcomer to the Minnesota Legislature, buthe is not new to Minnesota politics. TheMinneapolis native has worked on about 100 DFL campaignsover the past 20 years. All that experience paid off when formerDistrict 58A Rep. JimRice decided not to DFL elec-tion with Rice's en- dorsement. Rice, however, passed awaybefore the November general election afterserving in the Legislature for 26 years. \"Peopleare constantly asking me what it is like to befilling Jim Rice's shoes,\" Mullery said. \"It'simpossible. I don't think anybody could dothat.\" Mullery's district is an area of mostly work- ing class neighborhoods in the northwesterncorner of Minneapolis. There, Mullery grewup in the Victory neighborhood where hestill lives. His parents were both school teach-ers. His father taught at Henry High Schoolfor 39 years. A scholarship helped Mulleryattend St. Thomas Academy. From there, hewent on to the University of Minnesota forhis undergraduate and law degrees. After working a few years with a law firm, Mullery set up his own practice in down-town Minneapolis. He handles a wide rangeNew members . . . Mullery tackles crime, neighborhood livability, jobs of civil law cases with a specialty in real estatelaw. He has served as chair of the Civil Liti-gation Section of the Hennepin County BarAssociation. Since becoming involved in DFL politics in 1974, Mullery said he \"served as districtchair a couple of times and on the state DFLCentral Committee for 16 years.\" One of thecampaigns Mullery led was for the QualityEducation Coalition, a group of reform-minded DFL candidates that took over theMinneapolis School Board a few years ago. Mullery said that he had not intended to seek office last year. \"When he [Rice] an-nounced that he wouldn't run, I had to makea decision quickly because I wasn't planningon it. I went to the DFL convention alongwith three other candidates, but nobody wasendorsed,\" he said. The campaign set in motion a flurry of activity for the busy lawyer. \"For the next fewmonths I was campaigning and, at the sametime, trying to finish as many of my legalcases as possible,\" he said. Mullery won the DFL primary in Septem- ber and went on to take 74 percent of the votein the general election. He said that even though his district has not seen a lot of violence, the top five issuesduring the campaign were \"Crime, crime,crime, crime, and crime. In some areas thereare a lot of drug houses and noisy parties.Two years ago there were a number of cararsons in one area.\"Senior issues and education are two other concerns important to District 58A voters,Mullery added. \"I ran into a number ofpeople who said they would be moving whentheir kids got to junior high. Minneapolisgrade schools still have a pretty good reputa-tion but not the junior highs.\" Welfare also comes up as an issue in the district. \"There is a pretty widespread feelingthat the present system encourages anti-so-cial behavior,\" Mullery said. \"The peoplemost strongly against welfare are those work-ing two jobs to make ends meet. Overall,most people feel that they could go alongwith welfare reform if there also is money forchild care and training.\" Mullery also said he would like to see neighborhoods get more power to deal withproblem properties, landlords, and tenants,and is working on legislation to that effect. \u2014 Steve Compton District 58A Population: 32,114 Largest Top concern: \"In addition to crime, there are still a lot of working people and union con-cerns in my district\u2014concerns about jobs,pensions, livable wage, minimum wage, re-training programs, workplace safety, and re-placement workers.\" \u2014 Rep. Joe MulleryRep. Joe Mullery Snowmobile registration fees would in- crease from $30 to $45 for three years andtemporarily increase the amount of state gastax revenues designated for snowmobile-related purposes. During fiscal year 1998, 1percent \u2014 up from the current 0.75 percent\u2014 of gas tax revenues would be earmarkedfor snowmobile trails and enforcement. Also, the bill would appropriate $1 mil- lion annually in 1997, 1998, and 1999 forgrants to improve snowmobile trails acrossthe state.Hauling sports toys Outdoor enthusiasts would be able to haul a bit more on the highway, under a billapproved March 24 by the House Transpor-tation and Transit Committee. HF1111 , sponsored by Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka), would allow a trailercarrying a motorcycle, snowmobile, or all-terrain vehicle to be pulled at the back of a three-vehicle combination. Current law allows such combinations only when the front vehicle is a pickup truck, thesecond is a camper, and the third is a boattrailer. The combination cannot exceed 60feet in length. Weaver's bill would simply expand the limits on what can be carried on the trailer atthe back of the combination. The bill wouldmake Minnesota's law more consistent withthose in neighboring states. The bill now moves to the House floor.Continued from page 16 Both bills now move to the Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture FinanceCommittee.18 SESSION WEEKLY / March 28, 1997 First-term Rep. Gail Skare (DFL-Bemidji) enjoys reading. In fact, when she came to theCapitol back in January, she brought a bookby a Bemidji author with her, hoping that she would get a chanceto enjoy it in her sparemoments. \"I haven't touched it. Lately, I spend most ofmy time reading thingslike this,\" she said,pointing to a thick stackof bills, summaries, andrevenue impact state- ments on the table next to her. \"This is mybedtime reading tonight.\" Nor has she had the time to indulge in one of her other favorite activities: cross-countryskiing. \"Meanwhile, my husband's back inBemidji, getting out every day,\" she said. These days, most of Skare's time belongs to the state, in the form of hearings, meet-ings, and long hours hitting the books, learn-ing as much as she can about the issues thatconfront a new representative who sits onfour committees. Yet Skare would have it no other way. She is, after all, a legislator. \"Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed,\" she said with a quick grin, \"but I'll walk into thatHouse chamber and a little thrill wells upinside me . . . I'm really part of this!\" Whichby no means should imply that Skare is someneophyte just happy to have a place at thetable. On the contrary, Skare made her share of tough calls as a Beltrami County Commis-sioner, a post she held for 10 years before shewon election to the House. That job, sheNew members . . . Skare brings experience to property tax debate said, was great training for her current role.Indeed, she's more than familiar with prop-erty taxes and local government/social ser-vices funding formulas. For the most part,she said, the issues are the same; only theperspective has changed. No longer can sheconfine the scope of her decision to BeltramiCounty; with her seat in the Legislature comesthe obligation to consider the impact hervote will have on the entire state. Winning that seat, though, was no walk in the northern Minnesota woods. Things looked good in the beginning, Skare said, but before it was over she had to enduresome tough \u2014 yet effective \u2014 campaigntactics at the hands of her Republican oppo-nent. Polls showed that at one point Skareled her challenger by a nearly two-to-onemargin. Yet when all the ballots were counted,she had won by less than 2 percent \u2014 a mere277 votes. She attributes the erosion of support to a questionnaire mailed out by the NationalRifle Association to political candidates inthe closing days of the campaign. The orga-nization gave her a low grade, and awardedher opponent a much higher rating. \"He capitalized on it,\" Skare said. \"He sent out a letter saying I was anti-hunting andanti-gun. I could feel the support slippingaway.\" In fact, she said, nothing could be further from the truth. Her husband is an avid hunter,as are her sons. \"I've never been anti-hunting,\" she said. \"I've got bear rugs in my basement. It washard to fight that statement eight days beforethe election.\"Skare looks forward to working hard over the course of her term, particularly on prop-erty tax reform. She sits not only on theTaxes Committee, but also on the group'sSales and Income Tax Division. She also hasa place on the Agriculture Committee andthe Local Government and MetropolitanAffairs Committee. In addition to property taxes, Skare said, many of her constituents have told her edu-cation issues are a high priority, along withwelfare reform, particularly how the newfederal mandates will affect services on alocal level. But as a first-termer who happensto have more than a little experience in localgovernment, she's realistic about just howmuch she can change things on the state side. \"I'm not hung up on . . . having to carry a bill \u2014 not that I won't,\" Skare said. \"My roleis to use my background on how things affectlocal government and try to give perspectivefrom that end.\" \u2014 Top concern: \"My desire is to better the relationship between state and local govern-ments \u2014 distribute resources more equitablybetween communities and provide some flex-ibility in how communities execute state man-dates.\" \u2014 Rep. Gail SkareRep. Gail Skare Committee deadlines Each year the House and Senate set deadlines by which most bills must beheard in a committee and forwardedthrough the process. The deadlines serveto weed out some of the several thousandbills introduced each year. The first committee deadline is Wednesday, March 26 . That means all bills must be passed out of all policy com-mittees in their house of origin to receivefurther consideration this session. If aHouse bill hasn't been approved by House policy committees by the dead-line, but its Senate companion has, thebill has met the committee deadline. By the second committee deadline \u2014 Wednesday, April 9 \u2014 all bills other than those containing appropriations,must be passed out of all policy com-mittees in both the House and theSenate. The deadline does not apply tothe finance divisions of the commit-tees or the Rules and Legislative Ad-ministration Committee, the TaxesCommittee, and the Ways and Means Committee. By Friday, April 18 , all appropria- tions bills must clear their policy andfinance committees and move to eitherthe Taxes Committee or Ways andMeans Committee. Of course, there are exceptions to the deadlines. Any lawmaker may try toconvince the Rules and Legislative Ad-ministration Committee, which includesleaders from both party caucuses, tohear a bill after the deadlines.19 March 28, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY In the Hopper . . .

State officials often boast about Minnesota's many accomplishments.But when it comes to blowing the state'shorn, it is hard to top the MinnesotaState Band. As the state's communityband, the nonprofit musical organiza-tion performs in all of the Twin Citiesmajor concert halls, at festivals aroundthe state, and even tours other countries. Although band membership is open to any adult resident of Minnesota, mostmembers live in the Twin Cities metro-politan area. \"A good 50 or 60 percentare state employees,\" said the band'sdirector, Joe Kromo, an accountant inthe state Department of Agriculture.\"The current membership is at 55. Thereare always some openings in some sec-tions. Our ideal is about 60 members.\" Kromo, like other band members, is a volunteer. Each member must supplyhis or her own instrument, travel ex-penses, and uniform (blue blazers, grayslacks, and striped tie), he said. Whilethe band is not officially recognized bythe state, it does receive a $2,000 per yearappropriation from the Department ofAdministration. Other funds come frommember-sponsored sales and from as-sociate members who donate $20 peryear. When the band started in 1898, there were about 14 state bands in the UnitedStates, Kromo said. \"It was a tradition,Do you know? following the [John Philip] Souza for-mat. Now we are the only one.\" The band's highly varied concert rep- ertoire includes contemporary music forwind ensembles, popular selections, fa-mous marches, and symphonic tran-scriptions. Each year, the band plays a regular schedule and several special events. Sinceits inception, the band has maintained atradition of performances at the ComoPark Lakeside Pavilion in St. Paul. Theannual concert series takes place onWednesday evenings in August. In addi-tion, the band plays an anniversary con-cert in April, a fall concert in October, aholiday concert, and the governor's holi-day reception, Kromo said. The band has performed at the State Capitol on many occasions, from thewelcoming of the Prime Minister of Ice-land to a reception for several foreignambassadors at the opening of the World Trade Center in St. Paul. Outstate community festivals, such as the New Ulm Heritage Fest, are anotherfrequent venue for the band. \"We haveperformed in more Minnesota commu-nities than any other musical group,\"Kromo said. The organization has also served as Minnesota's cultural ambassador to theworld. The band toured Europe twice,visiting cities in Germany and Austria in1986, and Poland, Czechoslovakia, Aus-tria, and Germany in 1992. In 1987, theband hosted two German composersand concert conductors in Minnesota.The band has participated in two inter-national music festivals, in Castellon dela Plana, Spain, in 1990, and at theEUROFANFARE music festival inVillefranche-de-Ronuergue, France, in1993. Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL- Hermantown), is an honorary memberof the band, Kromo said. She accompa-nied the group on its 1986 tour andbrought official state proclamationsalong to present to each city visited. Kromo said the band plans to return to Europe in 1997 for a tour of Italy,Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, and toparticipate in the 100th anniversary ofthe City Band of Kempten, Germany. \u2014 Steve Compton The state band in 1898MINNESOTA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE 175 STATE OFFICE BUILDING ST.

Minnesota first becamea state almost 139 years ago; elected officials today face some of the same issues. Often overlooked is the history of the Legislature and why it is so structured. An act by Congress authorized a state government in 1857. The ruling allowed the inhabitantsof a portion of the Minnesota Territory \". . . to form for themselves a constitution andstate government. . . .\" Today, this \"citizen\" legislature state operates as a part-timebody, and the majority of its elected members are educators, farmers, attorneys,homemakers, a few full-time legislators, or business owners. They are citizen legislatorswho make decisions in a time-consuming manner to improve the state's quality of life.Deliberate use of time is also provided by average citizens who advocate for or againstproposed policy. Both demonstrate flexibility in time, commitment, and experience toaddress over 2,000 bills that will have been introduced this session. Size, length of sessions, and single governing bodies are not innovations of the U.S. Constitution, nor of Minnesota's constitutional convention delegates in 1857. How theLegislature operates today is based in part on the influence of the English theorist, JohnLocke, and the French nobleman, Montesquieu. Locke's notion of government byconsent, as well as Montesquieu's belief that \"The ideal political form was a separationand balance of powers within government\" are the ideas that play a key role in howMinnesota governs itself. According to a 1975 Citizens League report, \"The primary objective in structuring the Legislature should be to make it possible for the widest range of able and qualifiedpersons to serve as representatives of the people. . . . A government that functions bestis composed of a diverse group of individuals.\" The report is still worthy of review for the self-governing issues that continue to arise. It states that a reduction in size would not improve the operation of the Legislature,particularly if size is based on the size of other legislatures. While the Minnesota Senateis the largest state senate, all but nine of the state houses of representatives are larger.The comparison should be made on the relevant number of persons in a district. Even though this Citizens League report is 22 years old, its proposals about the structure of the Legislature are still valid. The Legislature should not change itsresponsibilities to the citizenry, nor should it increase its costs of operation by reducingits size. \"While a smaller legislature might be more efficient, the purpose is not to beefficient, but to [be deliberate, and truly] represent the people.\" Deliberation of theissues will continue. \u2014 LeClair G. Lambert3 April 4, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . March 27 - April 3, 1997 Highlights By the time the 80th Legislature con- vened in St. Paul for the start of thesession, most members had publicly ac- knowledged the need to overhaul the state'sconvoluted property tax system. Privately,though, many remained skeptical that thejob could be done this year. But when Gov. Arne Carlson, drawing on February's Department of Revenue eco-nomic forecast, reported that the size of thestate's budget surplus had increased from anestimated $1.4 billion to more than $2.3billion, he also ratcheted up the pressure onthe Legislature to actually restructure thesystem. Carlson has put forth his own plan, and at last count, the House Taxes Committee hadbefore it no fewer than 10 property tax re-form packages, some more radical than oth-ers, but all aimed at permanentlyfixing the system that hasspawned some of the nation'shighest property tax rates. Property taxes have existed in Minnesota, in some form or an-other, since 1849. In that year,the First Territorial Assembly lev-ied a tax on the citizens based onthe value of their property \"toestablish and maintain commonschools,\" according to a March23 Minneapolis StarTribune edi- torial by Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Doug Johnson(DFL-Cook). Since that time, thetax \u2014 a combination of state andlocal levies that is the primarymechanism for funding K-12education and most city andcounty services \u2014 has seenmarked increases. In fact, the Leg-islature has tried to rein it in atleast four times. Past reform efforts focused on \"broadening the tax base,\" thatis, seeking another revenuestream to replace the almost nar-cotic dependence on property taxdollars. Twice the Legislature cre-ated new revenue sources in theReforming the system . . . Surplus provides incentive for property tax reform name of broadening the tax base, enactingthe individual and corporate income tax in1933, and the sales tax in 1967. Yet each time,the property tax re-emerged as the preemi-nent source of government dollars. Today,the property tax is once again the largestsource of public revenues in the state, ac-counting for nearly 30 percent of all fundstaken in by Minnesota government. But today's taxpayer, unlike those of 1933 or 1967, moves through a system bloated bydecades worth of patchwork relief measures,a process that has created dozens of propertyclassifications and sub-classifications. In-deed, by all accounts, the system has growninto an overly complex, inefficient and un-responsive anachronism that the state's ownrevenue department calls the most compli-cated in the nation.\"In this state, we are far too dependent on property taxes to raise revenues,\" Long saidat a recent House tax meeting where sheexplained HF1871 , the reform bill she has co-sponsored with Sen. Johnson. \"Increas-ing the state share of K-12 spending willsolve problems for everybody,\" by reducingthe reliance on local levies. Of course, the nuts and bolts of the vari- ous approaches may differ, but nearly everyreformer agrees on the nature of the prob-lems confronting the system. According to acomparison study put together by Housefiscal analysts, each of the reform proposalscontains a handful of common elements,including: a greater measure of accountability where property tax increases are concerned; improvements to the system's efficiency, particularly with re-gard to education funding; a simplification of property tax laws; enhancing the competitive po- sition of Minnesota businesses,in part, by reducing the prop-erty tax burden on commer-cial/industrial properties, and some form of relief to all prop- erty tax payers. Greater accountability is per- haps the most important aspectof reform, said Department ofRevenue Commissioner JimGirard as he outlined HF1617 , the governor's proposal, at aMarch 13 meeting of the HouseTaxes Committee. Increasing ac-countability, he said, would go along way toward reducing the re-liance of communities on localproperty tax levies. Under thegovernor's plan, local officialswould operate under a levy limit. Levy limits themselves are not a new idea. The Legislature re-pealed them in 1992, and sincethen local units of governmenthave been free to increase theirproperty taxes, limited only by Minnesota legislators are out to reform the state's complex property taxsystem. At issue: how to provide some relief to business and rental propertyowners while shielding homeowners from a shift in tax liability.4 SESSION WEEKLY / April 4, 1997 Cost estimates (in millions) of property tax reform proposals House File number levy-setting process.)Most reform proposals are based on thepremise that successful, long-term reformcan't occur without ensuring some govern-mental responsibility for future property taxincreases, either in the form of voter ap-proval or outright limits on local propertytax levies. \"We need to make sure,\" Girard said, their money is . . . [and] who is responsible for whatpart of the levies.\" In addition to increased accountability, reformers have across the board expressed aneed to streamline the distribution of thestate's property tax revenue to communities.Under current law, those dollars are distrib-uted through two programs \u2014 Homesteadand Agricultural Credit Aid (HACA) andLocal Government Aid (LGA) \u2014 accordingto a set of complex formulas. The local gov-ernments, in turn, use this money, in con-junction with their local levies, to providetax relief and fund important local services. All of the reform proposals contain some method of increasing the state's share ofeducation funding, currently 65.8 percent ofall K-12 spending. Some proposals, such asHF639 , sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL- New Hope), would require that the statecompletely fund the cost of K-12 education.Others, such as the governor's plan andHF1103 , sponsored Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth), call for \"education home-stead credits\" designed to reduce the taxburden that would shift onto homes as aresult of changes to the system \u2014 essentiallyproviding a subsidy to homeowners for theeducation costs that are now met by statefunding. As the state assumes a greater share, if not all, of education costs, HACA and LGA pay-ments from the state would be reduced oreliminated under many of the reform plans.Thus, the system would be streamlined. \"It's an attempt to break down some of the old warhorses of the past and move the de-bate forward,\" said HF1852 sponsor Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) of the effortto restructure the venerable aid-to-local-government programs. Reformers have also, in the name of sim- plification, targeted the complex maze ofclassifications used to assess the value ofproperties. The simplification efforts \u2014which range from keeping the existing model,as in Rep. Dan McElroy's (R-Burnsville)HF1253 , to throwing out the current struc- ture, as advocated by Rep. Andy Dawkins(DFL-St. Paul) in HF1292 \u2014 employ three distinct means to achieve the stated end. Some bills simply reduce the number of property class rates. Others compress therates; that is, they spread the levies moreevenly among the existing classes. Still oth-ers would make the state's general educationlevy an explicit state property tax, assessedaccording to rates that would be fixed instatute. Most of the proposals tie the tax more closely to a property's market value. As itnow stands, a property's tax is based both onits value and its classification. Propertieswith lower classification rates \u2014 homes andfarms \u2014 pay less tax than a comparablyvalued apartment or business property. Shifting to a system that emphasizes mar- ket value over use as a tax base, some reform-ers say, would create a property tax systemthat is not only more equitable and efficient,but one that makes Minnesota businessesmore competitive in the global economy byproviding some much-needed tax relief tobusinesses and landlords. Currently, busi-nesses and rental properties are subject tosome of the highest property taxes in thecountry.That relief would be both immediate and long-term, ensuring that business remainscompetitive for years to come, McElroy saidat a March 20 informational tax hearing. \"The overriding theory,\" McElroy said, \"is that if property tax is tied to market value,spending restraint will necessarily follow.\" But that relief, said Long, must extend in some fashion to all property tax payers, notjust the business community and landlords. And therein lies the rub: reform almost guarantees shifting tax liability from oneclass, i.e., business, to another \u2014 probablyhomeowners \u2014 which is why most legisla-tors realize that it is now or never for prop-erty tax reform. \"It's difficult to protect people from shifts when there's no money,\" said Long, whochairs the House Taxes Committee. \"Therehas to be a mechanism for protection for thetaxpayers.\" That protection, she said, is the state's budget surplus. The surplus provides a window of oppor- tunity for significant reform by giving legis-lators a financial cushion to phase inrestructuring. In fact, most of the plans draw,to some degree, on the surplus. Property tax reform will get done, Long said, adding that legislators are unanimouson the need for it. The only question is whatform it will take. \"The ultimate product will be a synthesis of elements contained in all the proposals,\"she said. \u2014 F.J. Gallagher CRIME Stamping out arson Arson is now the second leading cause of all fires and the number one cause of prop-erty loss in Minnesota, according to a reportissued by the state attorney general's arsontask force. In the past five years, $113 millionworth of property in Minnesota has beendestroyed by arson. Not only that, 20 Minnesotans have been killed by the work of arsonists since 1989,says the report, the findings of which are partof the reason for HF1586 . Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the bill, and theHouse Judiciary Committee approved itApril 2. Laws covering the crime of arson have not kept up with the crime, said Minnesota At-torney General Hubert H. Humphrey, III.\"We haven't looked at it comprehensively inSource: House Fiscal Analysis Department5 April 4, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY EDUCATIONSCHOOLa long time,\" he said. \"I consider this a very important matter. Too often, we don't real-ize the impact of arson crimes.\" \"Everyone in this room pays for arson,\" said Skoglund. \"Arson puts every fire fighter'slife at risk and puts others' lives at risk.\" The report says that nationwide, 700-900 people die annually from arson fires, prop-erty damage exceeds $2 billion, and 20 per-cent of all fires are caused by arsonists. Worse, the crime is increasingly being caused by juveniles. Over half of arson ar-rests are children; 38 percent are under theage of 14, 15 percent are under 10. In Minnesota, in the past five years, 24 children have died using fire inappropri-ately. Almost $17 million in property hasbeen destroyed by young children who hadaccess to fire materials. FBI research indi-cates that an arsonist's profile often shows ahistory of juvenile fire setting. Skoglundpointed out that it is increasingly a tool ofgang members. Even so, the report states, arrests, pros- ecutions, and convictions for arson are rare.Arson is an especially difficult crime to in-vestigate and prosecute and, it says, the pub-lic does not understand the seriousness ofthe crime. The bill would appropriate $1.2 million to implement a wide-ranging approach to fight-ing the problem. It would set up an arsonstrike force with representatives from thefire marshal's office; the Bureau of CriminalApprehension; the Office of the AttorneyGeneral; county attorneys; the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; Minneapo-lis and St. Paul police; private detectives; andother arson experts. The strike force would assist local agencies throughout the state infighting arson. The bill would also establish an arson training unit for fire fighters, police, andprosecutors, and set up a juvenile fire-starterintervention program. It would also step upenforcement measures. The $1.2 millionwould be appropriated as follows: $372,000 would be used to establish an arson training unit and carry out educa-tional programs for fire fighting and re-lated personnel; $265,000 would be used to hire an addi- tional attorney in the attorney general'soffice to specialize in arson prosecutionsand to train law enforcement, fire service,and state fire marshal personnel on legalissues relating to arson crimes. The moneyalso would reimburse strike force mem-bers; $240,000 would be used to hire an addi- tional fire investigator to be assigned tonorthern Minnesota and to provide me-chanical, electrical, engineering, or techni-cal experts to assist in determining thecause of fires; $221,000 would be used to hire an addi- tional forensic scientist to process arsonevidence, provide laboratory instrumentsand training needed to process arson evi-dence, and provide training and equip-ment for a polygraph specialist; and $110,000 would be used to stop juvenile arson, develop an injury prevention edu-cation curriculum, fund an annual train-ing forum on juvenile fire-setting behavior,and help fire departments collect data onjuvenile-related fire incidents. HF1586 next will be heard in the House Judiciary Finance Division. Crime costs at least $10 Criminals booked at county jails in Min- nesota soon may get another reminder thatcrime does not pay. Instead, in at least onesmall way, it costs. HF234 , sponsored by Rep. Bill Macklin (R-Lakeville), was approved by the HouseJudiciary Committee's Judiciary FinanceDivision April 1. The bill would permitsheriff's departments in Minnesota to chargepeople who are booked in county or regionaljails a booking fee of up to $10. Macklin said the idea for collecting the fees came from Dakota County Sheriff DonGudmundson, who compared it to the medi-cal co-pay that county jails already collectfrom inmates. Gudmundson said that at leastone state already allows sheriff's departments to charge a booking fee to cover things likeshoes, socks, and other government-issuedclothing. Minnesota counties conduct about 200,000 bookings a year. A $10 booking feewould result in collections of about $35,000for his county, Gudmundson said. But money, he added, is only part of the issue. \"It's accountability and responsibility. The criminal justice system isn't free. With this,the accountability process starts the minutean offender walks in the door,\" Gudmundsonsaid. If a person has no funds at the time of the booking or during the initial incarceration,the sheriff will notify the district court andask that the fee be included as part of anyfuture sentence. The fee would apply only to those booked and confined, not to those who are releasedafter booking, and would be returned in theevent of an acquittal or dismissal of charges. HF234 will become part of the Judiciary Finance omnibus bill. Preparing young students New spending proposals to ensure that disadvantaged children are ready to learn inearly grades are being considered by a Houseeducation panel. One measure would bolster a program to give at-risk students more time in a kinder-garten classroom, and another would pro-vide grants to help those students strugglingto learn to read. Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls), who is sponsoring both bills, said the measureswould help to prevent students from fallingbehind early and help schools \"get off thetreadmill of remediation, which is not goodfor students or for taxpayers.\" Under a 1996 education funding law, the state now provides grants to certain schoolsto provide full-day kindergarten or to pro-vide half-day programs for 4-year-olds. The goal of the program is to make sure at- risk students arrive in first grade prepared tohandle academic basics such as reading andmath. This year, the House K-12 Education Fi- nance Division is considering a bill that wouldinfuse more funding into full-day kinder-garten programs. HF819 would expand the full-day kinder-Tom Brace, Minnesota state fire marshal, testified before the House Judiciary Committee April 2 insupport of a bill proposing a comprehensive planto combat the state's growing arson problem.6 SESSION WEEKLY / April 4, 1997garten program established in 1996 and would alter the requirements in current lawthat determine which districts receive fund-ing for the program. Existing law requires that funding for the program be evenly divided between Minne-apolis schools, St. Paul schools, suburbanTwin Cities schools and Greater Minnesotaschools. Schools in each geographic area areranked according to the percentage of stu-dents on free and reduced-price lunch pro-grams to determine eligibility for full-daykindergarten funding. The bill would do away with the require- ments related to geographic distribution offunds. Instead, the plan would stipulate thata school with 25 percent of its students onfree and reduced-price lunch programswould be eligible for a grant. Schools withthe highest number of children on such pro-grams would be given top priority. The proposal would spend about $60 mil- lion a year on the kindergarten program.That's a significant jump from the $3.5 mil-lion appropriated for the current fiscal year. Schools receiving grant funding can de- cide whether to use the money for full-daykindergarten or for a half-day program for4-year-olds, which puts kids in the class-room a year earlier than usual. HF963 would set up a new grant program to ensure teachers are trained to intervenewith students struggling to learn to read andto provide for curriculum improvements toensure at-risk students are up to speed onreading by the end of second grade. Theamount that would be spent on the readinggrants is not yet specified. No action was taken on the bills. Both are expected to be considered for inclusion inthis year's omnibus education funding legis-lation. 1-800 homework help Stumped students would continue to be able to find help just a phone call away,under a bill being considered by the HouseK-12 Education Finance Division. HF607 , sponsored by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston), would provide $235,000 annu-ally to fund the Minnesota HomeworkHelpline during fiscal years 1998 and 1999. No action was taken on the bill. It is ex- pected to be considered for inclusion in theomnibus education funding legislation duelater this month. The Homework Helpline is a statewide service allowing students toll-free access toteachers who can provide assistance on awide range of academic topics.The service faced a financial crisis earlier this year and was just days away from shut-ting down when Target Stores stepped up toprovide $58,000 to keep the help line goingthrough the 1996-97 school year. In the past, the service has received its main financial support from Blue Cross andBlue Shield. The company provided about$230,000 per year to pay teachers to staff thehelp line and to cover other expenses. But Blue Cross and Blue Shield reduced its contribution to $150,000 for the currentyear as part of a shift toward more health-related contributing practices. The help line reduced services to absorb the funding reduction, but by early Marchthe money was nearly gone. Davids' bill would guarantee the service could operate at full staff during the next twoyears. Under the bill, funding would be pro-vided directly to the Southeast Service Co-operative, which manages the help line. The service has received more than 190,000 calls from students \u2014 mostly in grades fourthrough 10 \u2014 since 1990. The help line (1-800-657-6787) operates from 4:30 p.m. to 9p.m. Monday through Thursday and nowgets 300 to 400 calls a night. Davids said the service is especially helpful to Greater Minnesota students, who accountfor about 75 percent of the calls to the helpline. No private school tax breaks A plan to provide increased tax deduc- tions and new tax credits for private schooltuition, tutoring, and other education ex-penses has stalled in the House K-12 Educa-tion Finance Division. Members of the division April 2 voted 9-5 to reject HF308 , sponsored by Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer (R-Princeton). The bill is the legislative vehicle for Gov. Arne Carlson's proposal to expand schoolchoice for Minnesota parents, and the mea-sure has been listed among the governor'stop priorities for the current legislative ses-sion. \"This is one way to empower parents to meet the needs of their children,\"Koppendrayer said. But the proposal has drawn criticism from some who argue that it would divert fundsfrom public schools, and ultimately, wouldweaken the public system. Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) said the bill does not fit with recent legislative efforts\u2014 such as graduation standards testing \u2014that aim to increase accountability in publicschools.\"Isn't this running counter to the direc- tion that we've been trying to move in edu-cation?\" Entenza asked. Carlson's strong support for the bill indi- cates that the issue most likely is not dead forthe session. It could come up again whenomnibus education funding legislation iscompiled later this month. The bill would provide tax credits for edu- cation of $1,000 per child to a maximum of$2,000 per family for households with anannual income under $39,000. The creditcould be used to pay for private school tu-ition, tutoring, summer school, or other in-struction in core academic areas. Families that home school their children would be eligible for a $1,000 tax creditregardless of household income. Koppendrayer's plan also would triple the current tax deduction for education expensesfrom $650 to $1,950 per child in kindergar-ten through sixth grade and from $1,000 to$3,000 for each child in grades seven through12. The deduction could be claimed for things such as tutoring, summer school expenses,and computer hardware and software pur-chases, in addition to school tuition. The tax credits and expanded deductions would cost the state $150 million during thenext biennium. The Department of Revenueestimates that 64 percent of the benefits fromthe bill would go to families of public schoolchildren. The vote to reject the proposal came after the division heard testimony from parents,public and private school officials, and oth-ers during two days of hearings. St. Paul resident Cher Chou Vang said the proposal would help to provide educationalopportunities that fit the needs of each of hissix children. He said he would use fundsmade available through the plan to buy acomputer and to hire a reading tutor for hischildren. \"The more they get specialized help in tough subjects and the more they are ex-posed to topics, the more they will enjoylearning,\" he said. The bill also received support from Bethel College freshman Vernon Rowland, whogrew up in a poor family but received assis-tance to allow him to attend a private highschool. Rowland graduated from De La SalleHigh School, but his two older siblings didnot have such an opportunity. Both droppedout of public high schools. He told members of the division that his brother and sister would have completedhigh school if they had the chance to go to aprivate school.7 April 4, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY \"The teachers [at De La Salle] didn't just teach us,\" Rowland said. \"They were in-volved in our lives.\" Rowland also said the bill would give low- income parents options now available onlyto wealthier families. Critics of the bill argued that tax credits and expanded deductions would only en-courage parents to abandon public schoolsand would not deliver benefits to low-in-come families. Former Minneapolis schools superinten- dent and Macalester College president JohnDavis, now of Minnesota Friends of PublicEducation, said the bill would mostly benefitaffluent families with children in privateschools. \"You improve public schools by assisting them, by requiring them to be accountable,and by declaring them indispensable to ademocracy,\" Davis said. Koppendrayer said the bill would not weaken efforts to increase accountability inschools. \"The people who earned the money would spend the money as they see fit on theirchildren's education,\" he said. \"I think thatis the ultimate in accountability.\" ENERGYHead starters Just say no to smokes Expanded drug and smoking prevention programs in schools would be paid for by anincrease in the tax on tobacco products,under a bill being considered by the HouseEducation Committee's K-12 Education Fi-nance Division. HF792 , sponsored by Rep. Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls), would raise by 10 cents the taxon the sale of a pack of cigarettes and woulddedicate the revenue generated by tobaccotaxes to tobacco and drug use preventionprograms. The division discussed the bill during an April 2 hearing, but took no action on theproposal. It is expected to be considered forinclusion in omnibus education funding leg-islation due later this month. Deb Mosby, a chemical health counselor at Spring Lake Park High School, urgedmembers of the division to support the bill. Most smokers pick up the habit as teenag- ers, she said, but new funds for preventionprograms would help in the effort to steerchildren away from tobacco. \"It's really important the we hit these kids early and hit them hard with good, solideducation programs,\" Mosby said. The state currently taxes cigarettes at a rate of 48 cents per pack. Biernat said the 10-cent increase he proposes would bring in an additional $36 million annually. The additional revenue would greatly ex- pand state funding for anti-smoking pro-grams in schools from the current $200,000the state spends on such initiatives each year. The bill calls for the proceeds from ciga- rette tax to be directed to the Department ofChildren, Families and Learning. The fundscould be used for department programs tocombat tobacco and drug use or for grants toschool districts for similar programs. Electrical deregulation? On the heels of the recent deregulation of the natural gas industry, movements are afootboth in Congress and statehouses to deregu-late the electrical utility industry. More than40 states are considering the issue, and mostare looking to California, the first state toderegulate with a 1996 law. Minnesota lawmakers are among those studying the complexities. \"It's a huge, huge, issue, involving billions of dollars and a very big industry. It willaffect everyone in Minnesota,\" said Rep.Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) at an April 1meeting of the House Regulated Industriesand Energy Committee, which he chairs.The committee approved HF1299 , spon- sored by Jennings, which would reorganizethe state's Electric Energy Task Force anddefine its functions. The task force, established by the Legisla- ture in 1994 and charged with examiningnuclear waste and energy issues, would ex-amine the potential benefits and risks ofcompetition versus continued regulation ofthe electrical industry. \"I want it spelled out what the task force would do,\" Jennings said. \"Various interestgroups were fearful of being left out.\" Thebill details the task force's membership andfunctions, and describes the role of variousdepartments and interest groups in the pro-cess. The bill recognizes that the electric indus- try is undergoing extraordinary and funda-mental changes and that increased relianceon competition in the industry must be care-fully managed to preserve essential elementssuch as universal service, affordable access,and environmental protection. Jennings' bill would increase the task force's membership from 16 to 20 legisla-tors; half representatives and half senators.The members would coordinate with execu-tive branch agencies and conduct public hear-ings and collect data. In addition, input from industry and con- sumer representatives would be included inany future legislation. The Department ofHead Start teachers and students from around the Twin Cities listened to testimony on a billbefore the House Education Committee's Family and Early Childhood Education FinanceDivision April 2 that would increase funding for Head Start programs.8 SESSION WEEKLY / April 4, 1997GAME & FISHPublic Service would conduct technical and economic analyses. The Public Utilities Com-mission (PUC) would convene a consumerresource group made up of large and indus-trial, small business, residential, and low-income electricity customers. The PUC alsowould hear from industry participants andother interest groups. The bill also says that if the task force ultimately decided against state deregula-tion, the commissioner of public service shallintervene on behalf of the state in federalproceedings on deregulation. Some committee members expressed doubts about the size and complexity of thetask force. \"I'm afraid it will never build aconsensus,\" said Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St.Paul). \"I'm not sure what the product willbe, but I'm sure we'll pay a lot for it.\" Jennings said the structure reflects the desires of the groups concerned and makessure they all will have a voice in the process. The task force will present recommenda- tions to the Legislature by Jan. 15, 1998. HF1299 next will be heard by the House Rules and Legislative AdministrationCommittee. Biomass bypass? How involved should the state be in fuel- ing the biomass energy industry? That wasthe topic of discussion at an April 1 meetingof the House Regulated Industries and En-ergy Committee. The verdict: only in a low-grade capacity. The committee approved HF1508 , which would leave most of the initiative for bio-mass energy development to the energy in-dustry. It does, however, require the state tostudy ways to finance renewable energyprojects. As originally presented by bill sponsor Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls),HF1508 would have gone much further. The state would have helped fund the MinnesotaAgri-power Project, a public-private part-nership, which Kubly said would have beenthe largest biomass energy project in theworld. The project would have created a 75-megawatt biomass-powered plant in Gran-ite Falls, Minn. The energy would have beenproduced by burning alfalfa stems and otherbiomass products to create a gas for fuel. Kubly argued that significant state involve- ment was necessary in order to demonstrateto the energy industry that the state is com-mitted to supporting renewable energy pro-duction. The state has an interest in theresource because it is environmentallyfriendly and would boost rural economiesthrough construction and operation of the project, Kubly said. Alfalfa is a sustainableresource which would contribute to, ratherthan extract from, the environment, accord-ing to project literature. Further, biomasspower production, unlike power from fossilfuels, does not contribute to global warm-ing, it says. But most committee members weren't sold. Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City) saidthat if biomass energy production made goodbusiness sense, businesses would develop itand banks would finance it without the state'sencouragement. \"If there's an idea out therethat can make someone rich, someone willjump on it,\" he said. Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer (R-Princeton) said that government involvement in settingthe price for alfalfa as a way to help theindustry get started will simply have a rippleeffect on the prices of other crops. \"This isthe epitome of how to screw things up,\"Koppendrayer said. \"All we're doing is jug-gling dollars because it was someone's ideathat this is a better way to produce electric-ity. That has not been proven.\" Under current law, Northern States Power Co. is required to construct and operate,purchase, or contract for 125 megawatts ofelectricity using biomass by Dec. 31, 1998, tobe operational by Dec. 31, 2002. HF1508 next will be taken up on the House floor. A call for calm Hoping to forestall tensions when Indians in 12 Minnesota counties begin to exercisetheir fishing rights under an 1837 treaty, theHouse Judiciary Committee approved a $6.5million bill April 2 to fund preventionefforts. \"We don't expect the effort to be a long- term thing,\" said Ron Nargang, deputy com-missioner with the Department of NaturalResources (DNR). \"But it needs to be im-pressed upon anyone who may interfere withthose rights that it's a federal felony.\" Nargangspoke at an earlier meeting of the HouseJudiciary Committee's Judiciary FinanceDivision, which also approved the measure. In January, a federal court ruled that an 1837 treaty permitted the Indians to hunt,fish, and harvest wild rice off the east-centralMinnesota reservations covered in the treaty.The ruling has spurred fears by some thatIndians will over-harvest the lakes, or dis-rupt tourism in those areas based on a per-ception that the lakes are over-harvested.The bands have negotiated among them- selves to establish limits, and recently an-nounced their quotas on 29 affected lakes. Atthis point, they do not intend to commer-cially harvest on Lake Mille Lacs, the largestand most significant lake affected by theruling. HF1885 sponsor Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL- Bovey) said the money would be used first tolaunch an education campaign intended toprevent conflict when the tribes begin to fishthe lakes this spring, and if it fails, to fund lawenforcement. He said that the DNR andother officials do not expect significant prob-lems. \"The education program will let peopleknow that this is not a catastrophe,\" Nargangsaid. \"But, in the event of trouble, [it will] letthem know there will be penalties.\" Theeducation program will include printedmaterial designed for anglers and hunters,audio-visual pieces for radio and TV spots,videos to be shown at community meetings,general information meetings, and a seriesof public forums, Nargang said. Gov. ArneCarlson also is scheduled to deliver a televi-sion address on the issue. The bill would appropriate the money from the state's budget reserve. Some wouldgo to the board of tourism to help efforts tomaintain a steady level of tourism and miti-gate negative publicity. If law enforcementefforts are needed, most of the money willpay for overtime and equipment, such asfencing at boat landings, lighting, power gen-erators, face shields, headgear, and otherpolice equipment. The bill says the moneywill be appropriated to the commissioner ofpublic safety to reimburse the DNR, theOffice of Tourism, the departments of Pub-lic Safety, Military Affairs, and Transporta-tion, local units of government, and otherstate agencies for costs incurred related tothe 1837 treaty. Money not used by the endof June will be returned to the budget re-serve. Jim Franklin, of the emergency manage- ment division of the Department of PublicSafety, said that all or parts of 12 Minnesotacounties will be included in the efforts. Thecounties are Aitkin, Benton, Carlton,Chisago, Crow Wing, Isanti, Kanabec, MilleLacs, Morrison, Pine, Sherburne, and Wash-ington. The bill now moves to the House floor.

The editors9 April 4, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Electronic licensing The state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) currently distributes more than 40types of game and fish licenses and six typesof recreational vehicle decals at thousands ofbait shops, outfitters, and resorts through-out the state. The system involves reams ofpaper forms and a network of county audi-tors, license agents, and deputy registrars. The DNR would like to eliminate the pa- perwork and convert to an electronic licens-ing system. Gov. Carlson's biennial budgetalready includes appropriations for the tech-nology needed to bring electronic licensingon line in 1999. A bill ( HF369 ) providing legislative authorization for the DNR to makethe switch was approved by the House Envi-ronment and Natural Resources CommitteeApril 2. Tom Keefe, of the DNR License Bureau, told the committee that recreational licenseswould be available in three different wayswith the electronic licensing system. All ex-isting license agents would be provided withpoint-of-sale equipment allowing them tosell and print any license on site. A toll-freetelephone system and Internet connectionalso would allow customers to purchase theirlicenses directly from the DNR 24 hours aday. License agents would be able to run the magnetic strip on Minnesota driver's licensesthrough their equipment to pull up personalinformation to print on the buyer's fish orgame license, eliminating the need for paperforms. License fees also could be electroni- cally transferred. The DNR would contractwith a private vendor to operate the system,Keefe said. The annual cost of operating thesystem will be about $2.5 million, he said,which is the same as the current system. A pilot project is planned for the summer and fall of 1998 with full implementationplanned for March 1999. \"The benefits would be a faster and more efficient system for our customers and lesspaperwork for everyone. An electronic li-censing system also will allow us to improveour database and surveying capability,\" Keefesaid. \"I have to warn you that this bill is not going to help your angling ability,\" Holstencautioned the panel. The bill now moves to the House Govern- mental Operations Committee. LAW OUTSTATERepercussions of sexual abuse A bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee's Civil and Family Law DivisionApril 2 would help ensure that more victimsof sexual abuse get their day in court. HF846 , sponsored by Rep. Rob Leighton (DFL-Austin), clarifies the period of timevictims have to pursue an action for dam-ages after such abuse occurs. In 1989, the Legislature passed a law giv- ing victims six years to initiate a civil actionafter \"they knew or had reason to know that [their injuries] were caused by sexual abuse.\" However, last year the Minnesota Supreme Court, in Blackowiak v. Kemp, ruled that the statute of limitations time clock starts at thetime the victim realizes he or she has beenabused, regardless of whether the victimunderstands the nature of the injuries ortheir cause. In testifying before the committee, Jackie Barabash said her recent claim for civil dam-ages against her parents was dismissed be-cause of the ruling. Barabash said she didn'tunderstand the extent of her injuries untillater in life, when they interfered with inti-mate relationships and caused her to havesuicidal feelings. The ruling, she said, under-mines a victim's attempt to deal with theabuse by imposing a stricter time limit. \"Iwent to the system to do the right thing. Itwas important to me as part of the healingprocess from abuse,\" she said. \"To not havethe support when you try to do so is veryhurtful. You feel victimized all over again.\" Leighton's bill would clarify and narrow the 1989 law, and make a distinction be-tween victims who are minors and thosewho are adults. For minors, the statute of limitations would end six years after a victim knows orhas reason to know he or she was sexuallyabused, was injured, and the injury wascaused by the sexual abuse. Adults wouldhave six years from the last incident of abuseto file a claim. However, the bill also says that a victim under age nine at the time of the last abuseincident may not sue after age 30; a victimbetween nine and 15 may not sue after age27; and a victim age 16 or 17 may not sueafter age 24.

Lower Sioux police A bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee April 1 gives the Lower SiouxIndian community law enforcement author-ity over offenses originating on the band'sreservation in southwestern Minnesota. At present, the reservation is policed by the Redwood County sheriff's department.The band has no police force. HF464 , sponsored by Rep. Barb Vickerman (R-Redwood Falls), would au-thorize the community to have the powers ofa law enforcement agency in concurrence Tom Keefe, of the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) License Bureau, showed the HouseEnvironment and Natural Resources Committee April 2 a machine that would be used for an electroniclicensing system. It would dispense hunting, fishing, and other licenses overseen by the DNR, virtuallyeliminating the pile of forms before him on the table.10 SESSION WEEKLY / April 4, 1997with the Redwood County sheriff's depart- ment. The community would enter into anagreement with the sheriff's department todefine and regulate services and provide formutual aid and cooperation. The bill also provides that reservation of- ficers would be certified by the Peace OfficerStandards and Training Board, as are otherpolice, and that the community carry its ownliability insurance. The agency's jurisdiction would be lim- ited to persons within the geographicalboundaries of reservation land, althoughofficers could pursue an offender off theland if necessary in certain cases. Peoplearrested by tribal police would be sent to theRedwood County jail and be prosecuted bythe Redwood County attorney. A similar arrangement has been in opera- tion on the Mille Lacs reservation for aboutfive years. HF464 next will be heard on the House floor. SPORTS Civic Center improvements On April 3, one day after National Hockey League (NHL) officials visited St. Paul andproclaimed its Civic Center inadequate forprofessional hockey, the House Local Gov-ernment and Metropolitan Affairs Commit-tee approved a bill ( HF1176 ) to renovate the 26-year-old facility. The Hartford Whalers are currently look- ing for a new home and St. Paul is on theshort list of potential locations for the fran-chise. St. Paul is also one of six cities courtingthe NHL for an expansion team. The leagueis considering adding as many as four expan-sion teams for the 1998-99 season. On April 2, NHL officials toured the Civic Center with city officials and later met withMayor Norm Coleman and Gov. ArneCarlson to discuss the possibility of bringingprofessional hockey to St. Paul. \"I don't thinka major league team could function in thatbuilding under its current condition,\" NHLcommissioner Gary Bettman announced af-ter the Civic Center tour. HF1176 , sponsored by Rep. Alice Hausman (DFL-St. Paul), proposes to issue$51 million in state bonds to renovate theCivic Center. Gov. Carlson has alreadypledged $5.5 million as a down payment inhis budget proposal. Coleman said the city has already invested $118 million in the Civic Center construc-tion and renovation, including building anew parking ramp. Even without NHLhockey, the building will need $36 million in capital improvements, he said. Professional hockey in St. Paul will benefit the local and state economies, Colemanadded. \"Now a group of private individualsare willing to help out,\" he told the commit-tee. \"The business community is stepping upto the table. We would just ask that the statejoin us at the table [by passing this bill]. Thisis the kind of public-private partnership thatbuilds strong cities.\" According to city documents, planned renovations to the Civic Center include re-moving existing seats and adding 3,000 re-tractable seats and 13,800 standard stadiumseats in a revised layout. A new videoscoreboard would be added as well as hockeydasher boards and nets. The sound, broad-cast, and lighting systems would be upgraded.The existing sheet ice meets NHL standards. A large portion of the exterior would be removed, and replaced. A new entry lobbywith escalators, an expanded main con-course, club seating, a club bar and restau-rant, and a new suite level with 59 privatesuites plus four party suites are all part of the plans. There would be a new press box, andremodeling of the adjacent Roy WilkinsAuditorium into team offices. Coleman assured committee members that the Civic Center would continue to serve inits traditional role as home to state highschool tournaments. In response to a ques-tion, he added that none of the bond moneywould be spent until an NHL team has com-mitted to move to the city. The bill now moves to the House Capital Investment Committee. Ferd Crone, a member of the DutchParliament, was recognized on the House floorApril 1. He was introduced to House membersby Rep. Alice Hausman, who shares many ofhis interests concerning environmental issues.Dutch visitorStadium bill stumbles A bill to fund a new stadium for the Min- nesota Twins failed in a vote by the HouseLocal Government and Metropolitan Af-fairs Committee April 2. Committee chairand bill sponsor Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) had asked that the much-amended stadium legislation be sent forwardwithout recommendation to the House TaxesCommittee. But opposition to the stadiumremains strong among legislators and thebill failed on a 10-9 vote. The version of HF1367 Rest presented contains several funding mechanisms to re-place the controversial 10-cents-per-packcigarette tax dropped last month. The newmeasures include a 4-percent surcharge onhigher player salaries, a 10-percent excise taxon luxury suite rentals, a 9-percent sales taxon all transactions within the stadium, adedicated Minnesota State Lottery scratch-off game, and a $1-per-car parking surcharge.The bill retains a 10-percent wholesale taxon all professional sports memorabilia soldin the state. It is estimated that all of thesesources would raise about $25 million peryear. Before rejecting the bill, the panel amended it to up the Twins owner's contribution tothe stadium deal from $15 million to $50million. Jim Pohlad, representing the Pohladfamily which owns the team, told the panelthat requirement could be a \"deal-breaker.\" Another significant amendment made a possible state buyout of the team an optionrather than a requirement if the Pohladswant to sell after five years in the new ballpark.The buyout price was also changed to theappraised value of the team at the time of salerather than a fixed amount of $105 million. Two other amendments lowered the mini- mum player salary to which a surchargewould be applied from $200,000 to $100,000annually, and removed a ticket tax as a sourceof state revenue. Rest said she will continue to work on the11 April 4, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY bill to \"come up with a proposal that will be acceptable.\" She plans to bring the bill backto the committee for reconsideration nextweek. In order to stay alive, the bill must bepassed on to either a tax or finance commit-tee by Wednesday, April 9. Assisting disabled anglers Mark Jacobson, Brooklyn Park, told the HouseEnvironment and Natural ResourcesCommittee April 2 that his mother needsassistance baiting her line when she goesfishing. He spoke in support of a bill thatwould exempt those who assist a disabledresident from having to purchase a statefishing license.TAXES $ Taxing the Internet Minnesota's information highway won't become a toll road \u2014 yet. Under an amended version of HF1628 , approved April 3 by the House TaxesCommittee's Sales and Income Tax Divi-sion, the Legislature would establish a 12-member commission to study the idea ofsubjecting Internet access and on-line ser-vice providers to the state's sales tax. Thecommission would report back to the Legis-lature in 1998 with input on how to imple-ment a tax without stifling growth in thefledgling industry. Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake) who sponsored HF1628 , offered an amend- ment to the bill, striking the tax imposition,after hearing testimony from several indus-try representatives. Johnson said that taxing the 'net in some form is an idea whose time has come and onethat occurred to her after hearing a speakerat a conference on education finance. It is,she continued, vital to the state's fiscal well-being, given the rapid pace with which oureconomy has embraced technological meansof conducting transactions. \"If there was oil running through those lines instead of information, he told us, we'dtax it in a minute,\" Johnson said of thespeaker. \"With that in mind, I decided it wastime now to look at different ways of raisingrevenues.\" Many different interests, she explained, had come before the division asking for taxexemptions and those dollars will have to bereplaced somehow. The division referred the bill, to the full Taxes Committee. TRANSPORTATION Speed limits increased The speed limit on rural interstates would rise from 65 to 70 mph and on rural dividedhighways from 55 to 65 mph under a billpassed by the Minnesota House April 3. Thevote was 111-18.The speed hike was proposed by Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) as an amendment to abill ( HF1540 ) calling for motorists to slow down when passing a stopped emergencyvehicle with its emergency lights flashing.The move was adopted on an 87-43 vote. The amendment not only hikes the speed limit, but would remove the commissionerof transportation's statutory authority to\"designate a maximum lawful speed for free-ways and expressways\" in the state. Last year, lawmakers also moved to hike the speed limit on rural, divided highways.But Gov. Arne Carlson blocked the increaseby ordering the commissioner of transpor-tation to maintain the current 55 mph limiton such roads. Bishop's amendment wouldspecifically void that order, reinstating thespeed increase passed by the Legislature lastyear. A separate amendment would increase the speed limit from 45 mph to 55 mph on aportion of Interstate 35E in St. Paul, calledthe \"practice freeway\" by one House mem-ber. The approximately four-mile stretch ofI-35E between Interstate 94 in the north and the Mississippi River on the south has longbeen the subject of controversy. For years, the controversy was over whether to build the portion of highway.More recently, the controversy has been overthe speed allowed on the stretch, which wascompleted in the late 1980s and designed asa heavily landscaped \"parkway.\" Debate of the amendment to increase the speed limit focused on the divergent opin-ions of lawmakers from St. Paul. The amend-ment was offered by Rep. Steve Trimble(DFL-St. Paul) and Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul). Its strongest opposition came fromRep. Carlos Paul) and Rep.Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul), whose dis-tricts lie on either side of the controversialstretch of highway. Osthoff said the 45 mph speed limit is unnecessary and only creates a speed trap.Travelers on an interstate freeway expect ahigher speed limit and rightly so, accordingto Osthoff. But Mariani said the lower speed limit was a crucial part of the agreement that finallyallowed the interstate to be completed in St.Paul. The 45 mph limit keeps down the noisefor neighborhood residents who have I-35E\"running through their backyards,\" Marianisaid. Rep. John Tuma (R-Northfield) said the change in the speed limit most likely wouldnot result in an increase in noise becausedrivers now routinely travel 55 mph or fasteron that stretch of I-35E. The only changewould be that many of those drivers wouldno longer run the risk of getting a ticket,according to Tuma. On a voice vote, the amendment was at- tached to HF1540 , sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown). The bill now goes to the Senate.

The crux of the stadium controversy is quite simple: money and where it will comefrom. Those opposing taxpayer funding ofthe project have placed the bill ( HF1367 ) in its current slumber. Several legislators pitched their ideas for financing a new Twins stadium at a brain-storming session of the House Local Gov-ernment and Metropolitan AffairsCommittee April 1. Committee chair Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL- New Hope) asked proponents of five otherstadium financing schemes to present theirideas to the panel. All but one of the ideas areincorporated in existing bills, which werepresented for discussion purposes only. One of the most unique components of the deal originally put forth by the Pohladfamily is for the public to assume 49 percentof the team's ownership. House MajorityLeader Ted Winter (DFL-Fulda) wants tomake that ownership a reality for Minneso-tans by selling one million shares in the teamto the general public at $50 each. The $50million thus raised would become part of thestate's portion of the stadium financing pack-age. \"Minnesotans have always made a strong cooperative effort,\" Winter said. \"This al-lows people to be a part of the answer.\" The proposal, which Winter said could be incorporated into one of the existing sta-dium bills, would involve setting up a hold-ing company to sell the shares. By limitingthe sale to state residents, Winter said, thestate could avoid federal securities laws. Re-sale outside of the shareholder's immediatefamily would be restricted so that the hold-ing company would get right of first refusal.Income from the public's share of the teamcould either be put back into the stadium orpaid out in dividends. \"Whether someone buys a share for them- selves or for their children, Minnesota fami-lies could own a piece of the Twins,\" Wintersaid. Winter's counterpart from across the aisle, Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon)proposes an appropriately opposite tack:A closer look . . . The struggle to find funds to build a better ballpark Take the public completely out of the deal. Sviggum's bill ( HF107 ) would have the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commissionsell off its Met Center property and use theproceeds to pay off the remaining debt onthe Metrodome. The dome would then besold for one dollar to the Twins and theVikings as equal co-owners. The Metropoli-tan Sports Facilities Commission would bedisbanded. The two teams could then run the facility in any way they saw fit and keep all of theprofits from the facility for themselves, Svig-gum said. \"This legislation would allow theTwins to control their own destiny,\" Svig-gum said. \"They a takes Rep. PhyllisKahn (DFL-Mpls). \"Instead of buying a sta-dium, we would buy the team.\" Kahn's bill would appropriate $100 mil- lion to purchase the team from the Pohladsand resell it to \"provide broad-based privatecommunity ownership.\" Kahn would havethe Pohlads continue to operate the team forthe state. The experience of other sports franchises shows that team revenue and resale valueappreciates rapidly after construction of newballparks. Public ownership would allow thepublic to reap the benefits of that apprecia- tion and keep the Twins from moving out ofMinnesota, Kahn said. The Pohlads have said that if they don't get a new stadium, the Twins may be forcedto relocate to another state. Kahn said thePohlad family doesn't really want to movethe Twins out of the state. \"I lived in Brook-lyn when Walter O'Malley took the Dodgersto Los Angeles,\" Kahn said. After the move,the New York press ranked O'Malley alongwith Hitler and Stalin as one of the threeworst human beings in world history. \"Idon't think the Pohlads want to have such alegacy in Minnesota,\" Kahn said. An unpopular 10-cent-per-pack \"sin tax\" on cigarettes originally proposed to pay forthe stadium has since been dropped. Thatmove, however, left the stadium without anadequate source of financing. Rep. MarkHolsten (R-Stillwater) proposes to pay for anew ballpark with another \"sin\" \u2014 gam-bling. Holsten's bill ( HF1300 ) would authorize the Minnesota State Lottery to place 1,500video slot machines at Canterbury Park. Sen.Dick Day (R-Owatonna), sponsor of the Sen-ate companion bill ( SF492 ) told the panel that video slots could raise up to $68 millionannually for the state without imposing newtaxes. \"This is money we could use for any A bill for an act ating to civil actions; modifying and expanding rovisions for sanctions in civil actions; Statutes subdivision 6; and 609.5314, subdivision 3; proposing coding for new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 549; repealing Minnesota Statutes 1994, section 549.21. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE THE STATE OF MINNESOTA :ARTICLE 1 SANCTIONS IN CIVIL ACTIO 1 [549.211] [ SANCTION ACTIONS]vil acti or sanctions . Jerry Bell, rear , president of the Twins, along with Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission chair Henry Savelkoul, and Bill Lester, executive secretary, listen to Rep. Mark Holsten, one of severallegislators who pitched an alternative funding plan for a new outdoor baseball stadium to the HouseLocal Government and Metropolitan Affairs Committee April 1. 13 April 4, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYpurpose, including the stadium,\" Day said. House opponents of HF1300 , including Rest, argue that it expands gambling in thestate. Indian tribes, who own the state's ex-isting casinos, also oppose the bill. Day coun-tered that since betting on horse races isalready taking place at Canterbury Park,HF1300 would not add new gambling facili- ties to the state. In addition, the bill woulddedicate 2 percent of net profits from thenew slot machines to benefit non-reserva-tion Indians, Day said. Many critics of the stadium deal ask why taxpayers should spend up to $300 millionfor a new stadium while the Twins' billion-aire owner Carl Pohlad is only willing to putup $15 million. A bill HF1962 ) sponsored by Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excelsior) wouldmake the state equal partners with thePohlads and other private investors. The idea originated in the Senate as SF1727 and is known as the Oliver Plan for its chiefsponsor Sen. Ed Oliver (R-Minnetonka). Itcalls for the Pohlads, other private sector inves- tors, and the Metropolitan Sports FacilitiesCommission (or its successor) to each invest$80 million in the new stadium. The city ofMinneapolis would provide $30 million topurchase and prepare land for the ballpark. The sports facilities commission would pay for its investment with state revenuesfrom an existing tax on sports, health, ath-letic and country club memberships. Addi-tional revenues would come from a tickettax, rent on the stadium, and sale of namingrights on the facility. The Twins would re-tain all other stadium-related revenue. The Oliver Plan is contingent on the Pohlads and other as yet unidentified privateinvestors putting up their share of stadiumfinancing before the sports facilities com-mission would risk any state funds. Finally, the most recent proposal, by Rep. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth), is designedto postpone the ballpark debate. He said thecurrent proposals are floundering, and failto address the needs of other local sports franchises. Van Dellen also proposes slots at the horse track, but the goal would be to raise enoughrevenue to void the escape clause in the Twins'lease that allows them to leave the Metrodomeafter the 1998 season. The lease allows theteam to leave if operating losses rise and gameattendance dips to certain levels. Slot revenue would be used to buy hun- dreds of thousands of tickets, which wouldbe donated to charitable organizations. At-tendance would rise, as would revenues,thereby forcing the Twins to stay put. So far none of these ideas have caught hold with lawmakers. Despite setbacks in theHouse, a stadium bill \u2014 without mention offinancing \u2014 is still in play in the Senate. Oneor more of these ideas may provide the boostneeded to make something happen this ses-sion. \u2014 Steve Compton Do you know?The Legislature may soon recognize the lifetime of contributions made byone of Minnesota's most notable activ-ists. \"She's touched the lives of just about everybody here,\" said Rep. Joe Mullery(DFL-Mpls) of labor organizer and civilrights activist Nellie Stone Johnson atthe April 2 meeting of the House Gov-ernmental Operations Committee'sState Government Finance Division.\"She is an example of a person citizensshould look up to.\" If Mullery's bill, HF1583 , passes, citi- zens may soon be looking up to the 92-year-old woman, or at least, her image.The legislation would honor Johnsonby placing a bust of her in the StateCapitol \u2014 the first woman to receivesuch an accolade. Johnson, who lives in Minneapolis, has devoted her life to agitating for thecauses of labor, civil rights, and Demo-cratic politics.Born near Lakeville, Minn., in 1905, Johnson's parents were one of the fewblack families to own a farm in Minne-sota in the early part of the century. Heractivism, she told a City Pages writer in 1991, stems directly from her father'sinfluence. She began her career as an advocate in the early 1930s, when she worked asan elevator operator at the Minneapo-lis Athletic Club. When the institutionslashed her wages from $15 a week to$12.50, Johnson began to organize herco-workers in an effort to win back thewage cut. Eventually, she helped to or-ganize the Minneapolis Hotel and Res-taurant Workers Union, serving as thegroup's first female vice president. From there, Johnson ventured into politics, striking up a friendship withthe young Hubert H. Humphrey aftermeeting him at Duluth State College in1941. She was the first black elected to citywide office, in 1945, and one of theprime movers behind the merger of thestate's Democratic and Farmer-Laborparties in 1944. Johnson also led the drive to create the state and local Fair EmploymentPractices divisions \u2014 offices which laterbecame the Minneapolis Civil RightsCommission and the state HumanRights Department \u2014 and proved in-strumental in winning the desegrega-tion of the armed forces. She also servedtwo terms as a representative on theDemocratic National Committee in theearly '80s. In fact, Mullery said, Johnson con- tinues to be an activist to this day, andwill probably still be agitating even af-ter the bust is installed. The division approved the bill and will consider it as part of thecommittee's omnibus finance legisla-tion.14 SESSION WEEKLY 1997 Members List as of April 4, 1997 *All rooms are in the State Office Building, St. Paul, MN 5515545A Abrams, Ron (R) ...............................................209 .................................... 993419B .................................... 324048A Haas, Bill (R) .......................................................201 ....................................

Bill Hilty (DFL-Finlayson) may be a small-business man, but as a legis-lator struggling to define Minnesota's placein the global economy, he refuses to be pi- geonholed as just an-other pro-businessrepresentative. \"I think some naturally assumethat I small-business man's perspec-tive, whatever that is,\"Hilty said. \"But smallbusiness isn't really related to big business. In terms of what'shappening to our economy, I have more incommon with organized labor.\" The soft-spoken Hilty has been involved with manufacturing on a small-business scalefor nearly 25 years now. With his wife, the58-year-old father of five owns and operatesa furniture manufactuting business inFinlayson, although now that he's a legisla-tor, he's less involved with the actual day-to-day operation. Yet over the years, he said,he's had ample opportunity to study thedirection of the free market and governmentpolicy decisions. Given the trend in commerce toward con- solidation, Hilty said small-business owners\u2014 the traditional backbone of the Americaneconomy \u2014 might soon take a back seat tobig business interests, just as organized laborhas lost clout in the political process becauseof declining membership. Indeed, the pro-New members . . . Hilty studies Minnesota's place in global economy cess is already well under way, he said. Obvi-ously, the North American Free Trade Agree-ment and the General Agreement on Tariffand Trade weren't drawn up with small busi-ness in mind. \"Corporations,\" he said, \"are putting themselves beyond the reach of any one gov-ernment. It's not by accident that businessesare making these global arrangements.\" Yet Hilty remains realistic about the limits of his ability as a state representative to sig-nificantly alter the course of U.S. economicpolicy. In the House, he said, he needs to bemindful of the legislative bailiwick. Toward that end, Hilty, with his presence on the Governmental Operations Commit-tee and its State Government Finance Divi-sion, the Labor-Management RelationsCommittee, and the Regulated Industry andEnergy Committee, said he wants to broadenthe scope of debate within the Legislature. \"The Legislature,\" he said, \"has a very strong tendency to be myopic on whateverissues come before it. I'm afraid there's toolittle concern for the big picture.\" Hilty is no stranger to legislative politics, either. He managed former Rep. BeckyLourey's three House campaigns, and de-cided to run for her District 8B seat when shedeclared her intention to challenge formerSen. Florian Chmielewski in the DFL pri-mary. Lourey went on to win the District 8Senate spot. Beyond merely broadening the scope of debate, Hilty also has some concrete goalshe'd like to accomplish during his tenure in the Legislature, including some sort of sig-nificant property tax reform and a restruc-turing of the education finance mechanism.Of course, property tax reform implies achange in education funding, he said, add-ing that he vehemently opposes Gov. ArneCarlson's voucher proposal. Another of his top concerns is the move toward utility deregulation. Policymakers,he said, should not get caught up in thederegulation frenzy, but rather, exercise cau-tion and carefully consider the ramificationsof their actions. There exists, he said, thepotential to create a public policy imbroglioto rival the Savings and Loan crisis of the'80s. \"I think the whole question of utility de- regulation is that huge,\" he said. \"There'sreally the potential for bad things to happenfor the average consumer. We don't want tofind that we've indiscriminately committedourselves to a path we may not want to godown.\" \u2014 F.J. Gallagher District east central Minnesota Top concern: \"We need significant property tax reform that would actually change the wayschools are financed.\" \u2014 Rep. Bill HiltyRep. Bill Hilty During an April 3 meeting of the House Governmental Operations Com-mittee, members were sharply dividedabout funding for renovations to theState Capitol cafeteria. A bill sponsoredby Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) wouldappropriate $2.2 million to restore thecafeteria's original German rathskellerdesign and decor. About $1.2 millionwas approved in the 1996 bonding billfor the project. Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City), said, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, thathe'd learned from Perkins and DairyQueen restaurant representatives thateither restaurant could be built in thatspace for considerably less money. \"That covers land, the building, andthe franchise fee,\" he added. Paul Mandell, senior planner for the Capitol Area Architectural and Plan-ning Board, explained that zoningregulations do not permit fast foodrestaurants in the space. \"Perkins isn't fast food,\" Osskopp responded, adding that he appreciatedthe considerations of but \"$2.2 million? I guaranteethat won't play in Wabasha,\" he said. Kahn suggested he issue a press re- lease to test taxpayer opinion aboutputting a fast food restaurant in the historic space. \"For the quality of food [in the something here isamiss in terms of the cost.\" The measure was approved by the committee on a 10-7 party-line vote.It was later discussed, but not votedon, by the House Capital InvestmentCommittee. A Capitol Dairy Queen?16 SESSION WEEKLY / April 4, 1997 On Feb. 6, Rep. Nora Slawik (DFL- Maplewood) was on the House floor listen-ing to debate on a bill to reduce teen smoking.Four hours later, she gave birth to her own future teenager, VictoriaAnne, a healthy, 7-pound, 9-ounce babygirl. Two weeks afterthat blessed event,Slawik was back on thejob at the Capitol, de-vising a study of ambu-lance rates in Woodburyand working on a bill to create a statewide immunization registry forchildren. Taking her child's birth in stride is just another way the 34-year-old Slawik reflectsDistrict 57A's busy working-parent constitu-ency. In addition to she andher husband, Brien, have a 5-year-old son,Sean. \"My perspective is much the same asthe people I represent,\" she said. Slawik's family has roots deep in Minnesota's public life. Her grandparentslived in Benson, Minn., where her grand-father published the local newspaper, The Swift County Monitor . Slawik, however, was born in Tucson, Ariz., where her parents hadsettled. After graduating from Arizona State Uni- versity with a degree in recreation adminis-tration, Slawik took a management trainingposition with United Way. She worked forthe organization in Fort Worth, Texas, andBoulder, Colo., before accepting a fund-rais-ing position in Minnesota. Here, in additionto working for United Way, she has helpedraise money for Northwestern College,United Hospital, and St. Louis Church.New members . . . Slawik delivers on education finance, crime issues After moving to Minnesota, she married Brien Slawik, vice president of Slawik Enter-prises, a property development firm. Brien's grandparents, Haroldand Marie, developed Roseville's Har-MarMall. Slawik's interest in public service grew out of her work in the nonprofit sector. \"As aprofessional fundraiser, I've been involvedin the community and helping organiza-tions to maximize public resources. Whenyou look at the Legislature, it is a similarprocess.\" She also has been active in a number of community groups, including a charterboard membership with the Southeast AreaYMCA in Woodbury, the League of WomenVoters, and the District 622 EducationalFoundation. When former Rep. Walter Perlt decided not to run for re-election last year, anotherformer DFL House member, Pamela Neary,asked Slawik to run. Perlt agreed to chairSlawik's campaign committee. Education financing was a big issue for the district during the fall campaign. Woodburyis the fastest growing municipality in thestate and Washington County is the fastestgrowing county, Slawik said. \"We don't havea lot of commercial property in the SouthWashington County School District, and wehaven't been able to pass a school bondingreferendum.\" Slawik was one of many co-sponsors of HF1, already signed into law by the gover-nor, which repealed the cap on state fundingfor K-12 public education. Her position onthe Education Committee's Family and EarlyChildhood Education Finance Division alsohas put her in a good position to keep tabs oneducation financing issues that may affect her district. She recently introduced a bill(HF1977) to help the South WashingtonCounty School District secure more dollarsfor local schools. \"Crime is also a growing concern in the district,\" Slawik said. \"We are a first-ringsuburban area, and crime is coming out ofthe city toward us.\" Slawik's approach to crime issues is to focus on prevention programs. She has signedonto a number of anti-crime bills as a co-sponsor. In addition to serving on the Commerce, Tourism and Consumer Affairs and Waysand Means committees, Slawik, as vice chairof the Health and Human Services Commit-tee, has helped shape the state's response tofederal welfare reform legislation. \"It's a goodfit with my background in nonprofit work,\"she said. \"I am pleased to have an opportu-nity to work on welfare reform. It has beenthe committee's biggest challenge.\" \u2014 Steve Largest city: Maplewood Counties: Ramsey, eastern suburbs of St. Paul Top concern: \"My district is big and it is grow- ing.

Their responsibilities now are to discuss fiscal issues on how to run thestate efficiently. Much of this work will get done during many long nights for the nextfew weeks. The nights are also getting to be long in the House chamber as some of the 2,135 bills introduced get a hearing, get debated, and possibly amended. As the working days andhours get longer for members and staff, tempers often flare, and simple courtesy andrespect for another duly elected official may get tested. In this legislative session, the speaker has called for less bitterness with more emphasis placed on less partisanship. As the members attempt to reform welfare, makechanges to funding for education, devise some positive methods for property taxreform, provide bonds and levies for municipalities, or more dollars for crime anddrug prevention, individuals may tend to lose sight of what it means to compromiseor keep personal agendas out of the process. While it appears that many legislators in general may be attempting (in the Hebrew phrase, Tikkun Olam ) to fix the world, others are digging in and refusing to budge on issues that ultimately will need to be revamped in the future for the overall well-beingof the citizenry. The Minnesota Legislature has a long, proud, and positive history behind it. But a very negative picture of the Legislature was presented recently in a national govern-ment newsmagazine that compared previous sessions to the Tennessee Legislature. Tomake comparisons out of context, consider the pulse of the Minnesota Legislatureback in 1868. Minnesota rises above the magazine's critique if the following exampleis used as a benchmark: Minnesota passed into law the right of its black population tovote two years before Congress passed the 15th Amendment to the U.S. Constitutionin 1870. Tennessee just got around to it. Its Legislature finally approved the amend-ment last week, 127 years later! If there are any lessons to be learned, our Legislature will continue to take its internal and external criticisms in stride, continue to do what it does best for the people of thestate, and wisely take the words of author Robert Fulghum to heart: Share everything. Play fair. Don't hit people.When you go out into the world, watch out for traffic, hold hands,and stick together. \u2014LeClair G. Lambert3 April 11, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . April 3 - 10, 1997 Highlights Requiring welfare parents to work is ex pected to move another 12,500 Minnesota children into day care over the next few years. To prepare for the onslaught,a House bill sets aside $190 million over thestate's 1998-1999 two-year budgeting pe-riod. That's a 127 percent increase compared to 1996-1997. Part of the pot of money \u2014 $98 million \u2014 would pay for the child care needs of welfareparents now required to work under a newfederal law. About $90 million would beplaced into an existing program that helpslow- and moderate-income working fami-lies pay for child care using an income-based,sliding fee scale. There are currently about5,600 Minnesota families on a waiting list forthe program, which is called Basic Sliding Fee child care. The money in the bill is ex- pected to eliminate most, if not all, of thewaiting list. The remaining $2 million would be used to administer the programs. The Basic Sliding Fee program has be- come a vital part of the state's efforts to trimdown its welfare rolls. Without the program,the cost of child care can often push a work-ing poor family onto welfare. Providing the dollars for child care was in the state's best interest, lawmakers said.Under new federal welfare laws, states arepunished for not getting their welfare par-ents to work. Specifically, Minnesota couldlose millions in federal aid. Logically, if Min-nesota expects its welfare parents to work,child care assistance will be essential. The child care money is the major compo- nent of a $390 million omnibus spending billfrom the House Family and Early ChildhoodEducation Finance Division. The bill (whichhas yet to be assigned a House File number)was approved by the division April 9 andnext moves to the House Education Com-mittee. Sponsored by Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL- Park Rapids), the bill appropriates moneyfor programs such as early childhood educa-tion, community education, after school pro-grams, adult basic education, Head Start,Early childhood funding . . . Omnibus bill proposes record spending for child care food shelves, and homeless shelters. The bill's highlights include: A last-minute provision that encourages stay-at-home parenting for some low- andmoderate -income families. In effect, itwould pay parents on the Basic Sliding Feechild care program to stay at home withtheir child for the first year of life. Eligible families already would have had to qualify for the Basic Sliding Fee pro-gram and received child care help for atleast 30 days. They'd receive 75 percent ofthe average cost of licensed family homeday care for an infant in their county. The provision does ask for an unspeci- fied sum of money, and as of yet, there is noclear answer as to how much it will cost. $10 million to encourage child care worker training and expand child care facilities.Based on historical experience, the 12,500more children expected in day care meansan estimated 90 more child care centers,650 more family child care homes, and3,875 more legal unlicensed relatives andneighbors to take care of the children willbe needed, according to the Department of Children, Families, and Learning. A mandatory $5 monthly co-payment for families using state-subsidized child care.Families with incomes between 50 and 100percent of the federal poverty level wouldbe required to make a $5 co-payment eachmonth, regardless of how many childrenthey have. For a family of two, 50 percentof the poverty level equals $5,305 and 100percent equals $10,610. The co-paymentswould increase based on income for fami-lies earning more than 100 percent of thepoverty level. This provision sparked debate between those who said $5 to a poor family was toomuch and those who maintained it wasnecessary that families invest in themselves. \"Five dollars can mean a meal or a pack of pencils for school,\" said Rep. Nora Slawik(DFL-Maplewood) who tried unsuccess-fully to lower the fee to $1 a month. But Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe) said the $5 is not designed to make money\"but introduce personal responsibility intothe system.\" $30.5 million over the two-year budgetingKathryn Freeman holds her 10-month-old son, Tyler, during an Early Childhood and Family Education(ECFE) class at the Harding Community Center in East St. Paul. ECFE classes for parents and their youngchildren would receive $30.5 million over the next two years as part of the omnibus spending bill fromthe House Family and Early Childhood Education Finance Division of the Education Committee.4 SESSION WEEKLY / April 11, 1997period for a program that brings babies and toddlers together with their parents tolearn about a child's emotional, physical,mental, and educational development. TheEarly Childhood Family Education (ECFE)program is 23-years-old and designed forchildren from birth to kindergarten andtheir parents. $2 million for a proposed early childhood infant grant development program. Itwould provide money to local ECFE pro-grams that come up with creative ways tofocus on infant development and a parent'srole in stimulating and nurturing theirinfant's intellectual and emotional devel-opment. $12 million for after-school enrichment programs. Grants are provided to selectneighborhoods so they may offer after-school programs for 9- to 13-year-olds.The amount is $7 million more than the1996-1997 budgeting period. Theprogram's purpose is to reduce juvenilecrime, school suspensions, and increasestudent achievement. $30.2 million for Head Start, a 31 percent increase from the previous budget. HeadStart is a federal/state program that pro-vides low income preschool children withemotional, social, health, nutritional, andpsychological services. $24.6 million for adult basic education over the biennium. The program provides edu-cational opportunities for adults with loweducational levels. Services such as literacytraining, work force education, and Gen-eral Educational Development (GED)preparation. $250,000 for an adult basic education tech- nology project to design and evaluate theuse of on-line technology for adult learn-ers. Over a three-year period, a workinggroup of educators and technology expertswould develop an adult learning curricu-lum that meets Minnesota's graduationstandards and can be delivered using com-puters and telecommunications. $2.3 million for Minnesota food shelves, a 65 percent increase over the previous two-year budget. The increase is in anticipationof an even greater demand on food shelvesthis spring when many of Minnesota's poorwill see a cut in their federal food stamps. \u2014 K.

HF349 , sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), was touted by supporters as agateway to a valuable crop for farmers, butcritics charged it would hamper drug en-forcement efforts. \"This is really more of a movement than a crop,\" said Jeanette McDougal, chairpersonfor Drug Watch Minnesota , who linked theeffort to legalize industrial hemp to support-ers in a drug subculture. McDougal's testimony flatly contradicted the message of bill supporters, who arguedthat industrial hemp is inherently differentfrom the plant that yields marijuana. \"In the United States, when you say hemp you think of marijuana, but in much of therest of the world that is not the issue,\" saidDavid Morris, vice president of the Institutefor Local Self Reliance. Morris said industrial hemp is now grown in 26 countries around the world, and thatCanada is moving toward allowing hemp asan agricultural crop. The plant is valuable inthe production of a variety of goods rangingfrom paper to clothing to twine, he added. \"The jury is still out right now as to whether this is a niche crop or more than that,\"Morris said. \"But the jury is not out the onpotential uses.\" As originally written, the bill would have allowed Minnesota farmers to grow indus-trial hemp and set up a registration processfor farmers wanting to grow the crop. That plan was supported by officials from two major agriculture groups in the state.Tom Cochrane, executive director of theMinnesota Agri-Growth Council, called thebill \"a slam dunk.\" And Chris Leifeld, director of legislative affairs for the Minnesota Farmers Union,said industrial hemp would have several ben-efits for farmers. The crop could be easilyintegrated into rotation and would be goodfor a variety of products. \"It's a good opportunity for our farmers to have access to a new market,\" Leifeld said. But a Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) official's testimony questioning thestate's ability to regulate the growth of in-dustrial hemp dealt Kahn's original pro-posal a blow.\"There are plenty of scoundrels out there who will divert this product into the illegaldrug market,\" said Michael Campion, anassistant superintendent for the BCA. Several committee members also ques- tioned whether industrial hemp could reallybe kept separate from its biological cousin,marijuana. \"If there's nothing wrong with [hemp], why does it have to be regulated?\" Rep.Michelle Rifenberg (R-La Crescent) asked.\"It just doesn't A tie vote of 6-6 killed Kahn's plan to allow farmers to begin growing hemp. After thevote, Kahn maneuvered to have the bill re-considered and offered an amendment thatwould allow a study of the issue to be con-ducted. With the amendment attached, thebill passed and now moves to the Housefloor. Kahn said the study could provide law- makers with more information about indus-trial hemp and should help in the effort tolegalize the crop. \"I think people will be more comfortable with it at that point,\" she said. Adoptions and race A bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee April 7 would significantly re-duce the role that race plays in placing chil-dren for adoption or foster care. HF209 , sponsored by Rep. Barb Vickerman (R-Redwood Falls), would de-lete current law that says a child's best inter-ests are met by giving consideration to raceor ethnic heritage when making foster careor adoption placements. Instead, the billwould require \"an individualized determi-nation of the needs of the child\" to be con-ducted, detailing \"how the selected placementwill serve\" those needs. The bill also says that placement of a child in foster care could not be delayed or deniedbecause of the race, color, or national originof the child or potential parents. However, adoptions involving Indian chil- dren, governed by the federal Indian ChildWelfare Act and Minnesota Indian FamilyPreservation Act, which allow for racial pref-erence regarding placements, would not beaffected. Prospective foster parents of In-dian children would be required to attendtraining on understanding the cultural heri-tage of the children and the importance ofthe Indian Child Welfare Act. Also, in suchcases, the foster care agency would be re-5 April 11, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYCONSUMERS50% OFF SALEDEVELOPMENTquired to defer to tribal judgment regarding the suitability of a home when the tribeintervenes on a child's behalf. In adoptions involving non-Indian chil- dren, the bill says a child's best interestswould be served first by looking for relativeswith whom to place the child; second bylooking for a close friend. The bill also pro-vides for a specialist to recruit a diversity offamilies for adoptions and foster care, butdeletes language regarding race. The bill lists the following as factors to be considered in determining the needs of achild: the child's functioning and behavior;medical, educational, and developmentalneeds; history and past experience; religiousand cultural needs; connection with a com-munity, school, and church; interests andtalents; relationship to current caretakers,parents, siblings, and relatives; and reason-able preferences of the child if of an appro-priate age. The emphasis on race or ethnic heritage in child placements has become controversialin recent years. Critics have said that a short-age of minority foster and adoptive familieshas caused children to languish needlesslywhile interested families were disqualifiedon racial grounds, and that race is not im-portant in family bonding. Vickerman explained that the bill would bring Minnesota into compliance with fed-eral legislation. In 1994, Congress passed theMultiethnic Placement Act, provisions ofwhich are incorporated into HF209 . Failure to comply with the act could result in federalviolations and reduced federal funding. \"Thefederal regulations say you cannot deny aperson the opportunity to be adopted basedon race,\" Vickerman said. \"Minnesota's lawsdo not comply at this time.\" HF209 now moves to the House floor. Rent-to-own The rent-to-own industry soon could be back in business under legislation approvedby the House Commerce, Tourism and Con-sumer Affairs Committee April 8. HF997 would regulate rent-to-own con- tracts. Currently, such contracts are prohib-ited by court order. Rental stores thatpreviously offered rental-purchase agree-ments, such as Rent-a-Center, now simplyrent, offering the consumer no chance toown the merchandise. Bill sponsor Rep. Tom Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) said the effort was designed toprotect buyers from predatory rent-to-ownretailers who \u2014 prior to the injunction \u2014 financed purchases at exorbitant interestrates after tacking on a variety of costs to aproduct's base price. \"This is a ceiling for the rates that could be charged,\" Pugh said. \"It would be a cap, andwe would hope that the competition gener-ated by the market would drive that down.\" Under HF997 , approved by a 16-7 vote, rent-to-own retailers would have to limittheir purchase agreements' ancillary charges,such as setup, delivery, and finance fees, toan amount equal to the original cash price ofthe items. Current law has no fee limit. Theseller also would have to disclose detailedinformation about the number and amountof payments due, in addition to various state-ments about the legal details of such ar-rangements. Rental-purchase stores offer their mer- chandise without credit checks, deposits, ordown payments. Instead, customers agree tolease the goods for a specific period of timewith the option to either renew or discon-tinue the agreement at the end of the term.The lease payments are based on the store'slisted purchase price of the item, plus anyadditional fees, plus interest. For many people, Pugh said, especially those living paycheck to paycheck, a rent-to-own contract is often the only way to pur-chase big-ticket household items such asfurniture or home electronics. Informationprovided by the Minnesota Rental DealersAssociation indicates that the typical rental-purchaser is a blue-collar worker between 25and 44 years old who lives in rental housing. Yet HF997 , critics said, would do nothing to protect these consumers. In fact, theyargued, the bill would allow the rental-pur-chase companies to charge even higher an-nual interest rates, some of which exceed 700percent. Expanding conventions The city of Minneapolis' bid to garner state dollars \u2014 $37.5 million \u2014 to helpexpand its convention center is not onlyalive this session, it's even popular with somerural Minnesota lawmakers. The House Economic Development Fi- nance Division April 9 heard HF1529 , which would appropriate an as yet unspecifiedamount of money from the general fund tohelp expand the Minneapolis ConventionCenter. Committee members did not vote on the bill but are considering it for inclusion in theomnibus economic development budget billdue out later this session. Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls), the bill's sponsor, said 10 years ago the Minne-apolis Convention Center was the 17th larg-est facility of its kind in the country. Today,it ranks 43rd. \"That shows you what our competition is doing,\" Jefferson told committee members. He added that of all the major convention McCormick (Chicago) 1 I-X Center (Cleveland) 2Las Vegas 8New 9Kentucky 10 MINNEAPOLIS 43 0 500,000 1,000,000 1,500,000 2,000,000Existing Expansion Square feet of exhibit spacePrime exhibit space comparison In 1986, Minneapolis had the 13th largest convention facility in the country. Today, it ranks 43rd.Legal Aid Society of Minneapolis attorney David Ramp said that since rental-purchasecompanies are currently prohibited fromentering into usurious rent-to-own agree-ments, HF997 would simply be an end-run around that injunction, setting in law a prac-tice that exploits low-income consumers. \"HF997 , if adopted, would authorize even higher charges . . . and set price by statuterather than in the market,\" Ramp said. \"Thestate of Minnesota should not be settingprices. It's bad public policy and it's badeconomics.\" The bill goes now to the House floor. Source: Major Exhibit Hall Directory 1996.6 SESSION WEEKLY / April 11, 1997centers across the country, Minneapolis is the only host city that solely absorbs its con-vention center's construction costs. Otherssplit the costs with county and state govern-ments. The planned two-story addition would include two new exhibit halls and wouldincrease exhibit space by 200,000 square feetover the existing 300,000 square feet. The current convention center \"is a beauty. It is well operated, but it is too small,\" saidMinneapolis City Council member AliceRainville. Jefferson said the convention site should be called the Minnesota Convention Center because the majority of its exhibitors arefrom outside Minneapolis and the centerbrings in money for the entire state. Minneapolis Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton agreed, adding that the convention centerhas lost numerous conventions in recentyears because it is too small. The mayor noted that outstate areas such as Duluth, Fairmont, Fargo/Moorhead,Winona, and Worthington all support ex-panding the facility because they know thestate needs a convention center big enoughto attract large national conventions. If it's not big enough, it will fall back into the regional market and compete with citieslike Duluth, Fargo/Moorhead, and Winonafor conventions. Referring to the handful of local projects this session requesting state help with con-struction, such as the Twins wanting a newbaseball stadium, Rep. Ken Otremba (DFL-Long Prairie) said the Minneapolis Conven-tion Center expansion is the only one aboutwhich he's received support from his ruralconstituents. Comprehensive planning Two bills approved by the Governmental Operations Committee's State GovernmentFinance Division April 8 would change theway Minnesota communities approach ur-ban planning. Both HF217 , sponsored by Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud), and HF1000 , sponsored by Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls), would adoptthe 10 recommendations for long-rangeplanning outlined by the MetropolitanCouncil as the framework for a solution tourban sprawl. Yet, beyond this, the billsemploy divergent tactics to accomplish theircommon goal. Opatz's bill would allow local governments to form \"joint planning districts\" that would,in turn, control development decisions suchas zoning and subdivision regulation. Thestate Office of Strategic and Long-Range Planning would oversee the planning dis-tricts, and any community that elected toform the joint planning district would haveto agree to the requirements defined inHF217 , including: submission of a comprehensive plan to the office for approval; periodic reviews and updates of those plans; and a provision allowing adjacent governments \u2014 including the Metropolitan Council \u2014to review and comment on any growthplans. The bill also requires participating cities to define urban growth areas and details amediation process designed to mitigate anyconflicts that result from any planning deci-sions. Opatz's bill would appropriate $500,000 for three joint-planning-district pilot projectsin the St. Cloud area, the Sherburne-Benton-Stearns County area, and a community to benamed later. \"If we can get . . . [the] to what this bill asks,\" Opatz said, \"it really bodeswell for what can happen in the rest of thestate.\" Long's bill, HF1000 , known as the \"Com- munity-based Act,\" also wouldemploy joint planning districts and the over-sight of the strategic planning office, butwould rely, instead, on a series of incentivesto encourage participation. Local govern-ments could receive grants administeredthrough the planning office to help defraythe expenses associated with community-based planning, in exchange for followingthe council's recommendations. HF1000 would establish a 22-member advisory council to develop the details of theplanning effort with an eye toward the MetCouncil goals, and provide grants to localgovernments that choose the community-based path. As yet, the proposal contains nospecific appropriations. \"The framework is for a voluntary pro- gram with an emphasis on joint powers,\"Long said of the bill. \"A city, county, or jointplanning entity will plan and be eligible forfunds covering assistance and technical as-sistance \u2014 but they would have to adhere tosome defined goals.\" The division retained both bills for inclu- sion in its omnibus finance bill.DRUGS Needles for drug users The House Judiciary Committee approved a bill April 7 that would allow pharmacists tosell hypodermic needles and syringes with-out a prescription. The panel's Judiciary Fi-nance Division approved it a day later. Contained in HF1150 , sponsored by Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), the proposal isaimed at illegal drug users and is intended toprevent the spread of AIDS and other dis-eases. Under the bill, pharmacists would be al- lowed to sell unused needles and syringes inquantities of 10 or less, but could not adver-tise their availability. Pharmacists also couldgive purchasers information on drug coun-seling, disease testing sites, and the state'sHIV hotline. Bob Tracy of the Minnesota AIDS Project said the effort is crucial in preventing thespread of disease among drug users and oth-ers \u2014 including children \u2014 such as babiesborn to mothers who use illegal drugs. Hepresented evidence showing a sharp decreasein needle sharing in Connecticut after thestate made clean needles available. Accord-ing to a letter from Dr. T. Stephen Jones, ofthe National Center for HIV, STD, and TBPrevention, \"One of the most importantways to prevent the transmission of HIVamong persons who inject illegal drugs is theuse of sterile syringes and needles.\" But committee members were sharply di- vided on the issue, with several saying the Check your local listings to watch the House committee and floor sessions on TV. Lorraine Teel, executive director of the MinnesotaAids Project, testified before the JudiciaryCommittee April 7 in support of a bill that wouldpermit pharmacists and pharmacies to sell, withouta prescription, unused hypodermic needles andsyringes in quantities of 10 or less.7 April 11, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYchange would sanction the use of illegal drugs. \"I will not be part of the legalization of drug paraphernalia,\" said Rep. Rich Stanek(R-Maple Grove), a Minneapolis police of-ficer. He said the provision also would worsenthe problem of drug debris that already lit-ters some public areas and streets. Stanekoffered an amendment to strip the bill of thelegal needle sales. It failed on a vote of 11-10. The bill also would appropriate $150,000 to the commissioner of Public Safety to con-duct an evaluation of the needle program.The first report to the Legislature would bedue Jan. 15, 2000, with a final report due byJan. 15, 2002. Other provisions of the bill would add prison guards and corrections personnel toemergency medical services personnel nowcovered by laws relating to HIV testing andexposure to the virus. The measure also de-scribes how police and other emergency de-partments should proceed if an employeemay have been exposed to the HIV virus. Anappropriation of $200,000 would be used totrain police and criminal justice personnelin such matters. Additionally, the bill would provide $150,000 to train public defenders, countyattorneys, victims advocates, and shelter per-sonnel who deal with victims of crimes thatinvolve HIV exposure; and $25,000 wouldgo to the Department of Human Services toprovide testing and early intervention ser-vices to crime victims. The measure will become part of the Judi- ciary Finance Division's omnibus bill. EDUCATIONSCHOOLENERGY Omnibus K-12 bill assembled Students who fail the state's basic stan- dards tests required for high school gradua-tion would be the subject of new remedialefforts, under an omnibus K-12 educationfunding package being compiled by a Housepanel. HF1684 , by Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee), would spend $51 millionto assist students who fail the tests or areconsidered to be at risk of failing. \"We're committed to doing everything we can to help those students who are at risk ofnot graduating in a couple years,\" said Rep.Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls), who was Kelso'sco-sponsor on a separate bill containing theremedial education plan. The House K-12 Education Finance Divi- sion began the final stages of assembling theomnibus spending bill April 10. Members ofFunding windmills The House Regulated Industries and En- ergy Committee approved a bill April 8 toenhance the wind-energy industry in Min-nesota. HF1925 , sponsored by Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison), would help the industry inthree ways. First, the bill would establish a pilot incen- tive loan program. The Rural Finance Au-thority could lend up to $3 million for windenergy conversion systems producing nomore than two megawatts of electricity, withno more than $500,000 going to any oneentity. \"It's a modest project that will prob-ably involve six to 10 loans,\" said Michael Matt Swedlund, a home school student from Plymouth, Minn., took a break from passing outstickers that read \"School Choice, Put Kids First\" during a school choice rally on the front stepsof the State Capitol April 9. He stopped to debate with Charlotte Scheithayer, of Rochester, abouttheir differing views on state funding for private schools.Differing opinionsthe division had not completed the bill whenthis edition of Session Weekly went to press. However, the division had voted to in- clude several major education initiatives inthe bill. Under the bill, all school districts would be required to lengthen the school year forall students, and pupils who fail the basicskills tests in reading and math would spendeven more additional time in the classroom. Beginning with students who entered the ninth grade in 1996, Minnesota's gradua-tion standards require all students to passreading and math tests before they are eli-gible to receive a high school diploma. The tests are first given to students when they are in the eighth grade. Eighth graderstaking the test in January 1997 fared some-what poorly, with 41 percent failing the read-ing test and 30 percent failing math. Theresults were similar when the tests were givento eighth graders in 1996. The $51 million included in Kelso's bill would go to remedial programs for thosestudents who must retake one or both of thetests and students who are in danger of fail-ing the tests. Those students would be required to spend the equivalent of three weeks of extra time inthe classroom, with additional hours beinglogged after school, on Saturdays, or duringthe summer. Funds for the remedial programs would be distributed to schools on the basis of eachschool's percentage of students on free andreduced-price lunch programs. The bill also would add three days to the school year for all students. Currently, thestate sets no minimum for the number of days in the school year, but most districtshold classes about 170 days a year, amongthe lowest in the country. HF1684 is expected to provide a 13.5 per- cent increase in education funding for the1998-99 biennium, according to figures re-leased by Kelso and others April 9. The governor's proposals to expand edu- cation tax deductions for private school tu-ition, tutoring, or other educational expensesand to provide new tax credits for parentswho send children to private schools are notexpected to be included in the bill. The omnibus bill was slated to emerge from the division by April 11. It will go nextto the full House Education Committee.8 SESSION WEEKLY / April 11, 1997ENVIRONMENT Brownfields La Shella Sims of Interfaith Action, a coalition of socially active religious groups, testified infavor of a bill that seeks money to clean upvacant contaminated industrial sites(brownfields) and redevelop them into newbusinesses with new jobs. Tom St. Aubin,Minneapolis, dressed in a contaminationcleanup suit and held a container of dry ice tosimulate pollution during the April 7 hearingof the Environment and Natural ResourcesCommittee.Noble of Minnesotans for an Energy-Effi-cient Economy. Second, the bill would add small busi- nesses, nonprofit organizations, and tribalcouncils to those who would qualify for loansto establish wind-energy facilities. Currentlaw says that a qualified wind-energy facilitymust be owned by the person who owns theland upon which the facility stands. An un-derlying goal is to promote local ownership.\"We want to make sure these facilities areowned by farmers before corporate con-glomerates step in,\" Peterson said. \"The bill provides for state support in helping small wind farms compete with largerinterests,\" Noble said. \"It also creates abroader range of entities eligible for the windincentive program.\" Finally, the bill would require utilities that purchase wind energy to develop a standardcontract that enumerates the basic termsand conditions for the purchases, as well asother information necessary to ensure reli-ability and safety. (Minnesota law requiresthat large energy suppliers like NorthernStates Power Co. purchase a certain amountof wind energy.) The wind-energy facilities included in the bill must produce no more than 2 megawattsof power per year between July 1, 1997 andJune 30, 1999. By Jan. 15, 1999, the financeauthority will report on the status of theloans and make recommendations on thecontinuation of the program. \"Minnesota is the national leader in the development of wind energy,\" Noble said.\"Thousands of state-of-the-art turbinescould be created in the next five years.\" HF1925 now moves to the House Envi- ronment, Natural Resources and Agricul-ture Finance Committee. Nuclear waste waits Companies in Minnesota that generate high-level, nuclear waste or spent nuclearfuel pay a fee to the U.S. Department ofEnergy (DOE) to take care of long-termstorage and disposal of the waste. The DOE,however, has failed to provide the service,according to Minnesota's Department ofPublic Service. The state continues to storethe waste. HF1879 , approved by the House Regu- lated Industries and Energy Committee onApril 9, would place the proceeds from thefee into an interest-bearing escrow account.The money would be released to the DOE\"upon a showing . . . that the federal reposi-tory for the long-term storage and perma-nent disposal [of nuclear waste] is operatingand currently accepting such materials,\" the bill says. \"We and other states have been paying a lot of money to the nuclear waste fund that'sbeen diverted for other uses,\" said bill spon-sor Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) at anearlier committee meeting. Mike McCarthy, of the public service de- partment, said $600 million per year is paidinto the account nationwide. Minnesota haspaid $253 million since 1982, and continuesto pay $15 million per year. Last year, lessthan a third of the money paid actually madeit into the program, he said. Some of the debate surrounding the bill, however, centered on the possible outcomeof a pending lawsuit against the DOE, towhich Minnesota is party. Rep. JeanWagenius (DFL-Mpls) suggested that a law-suit win could actually mean a loss for thestate. Proving that the DOE breached itscontract could result in a monetary award,and along with it, state responsibility fordisposing of the waste, she said. HF1879 will next be heard on the House floor. Livestock odor research Julie Jansen's family has experienced head- aches, nausea, blackouts, and diarrhea sincea hog confinement facility opened near theirGranite Falls, Minn., home two years ago.She blames the combination of foul odorand hydrogen sulfide emitted by the feedlot,and has turned to her legislator, Rep. GaryKubly (DFL-Granite Falls) for help. Kubly brought a bill ( HF913 ) to study the livestock odor problem before the HouseEnvironment and Natural Resources Com-mittee April 4. The bill, approved by thepanel, would appropriate $200,000 to theUniversity of Minnesota for the research anddevelopment of an odor rating system forlivestock production facilities. Informationgenerated by the research would be used bylocal governments to determine setbacks andother zoning requirements for livestock fa-cilities. The study also would help livestockproducers determine the best managementpractices to control livestock odor. The bill would mark another $200,000 for the university to research, develop, and pro-mote low-emission and low-energy hog pro-duction systems. Alternative hog productionis often done on a smaller scale and does notcarry as much potential for a negative envi-ronmental impact, Kubly said. One of Jansen's chief complaints con- cerned the lack of enforcement of existinglaws by the Minnesota Pollution ControlAgency (MPCA). The bill was amended torequire the MPCA to better enforce existinglimits on hydrogen sulfide emissions. Dave Nelson of the MPCA encouraged the panel to stick to the original intent of HF913 \u2014 to provide $400,000 for odor research. Hesaid that the MPCA has encouraged localgovernments to use zoning laws to controlodor problems. Researching alternative pro-duction models should be a separate matter,he told the panel. He also cautioned against setting a prece- dent by mandating that the agency enforcecertain laws. \"Hydrogen sulfide is alreadyregulated,\" he said. \"You could start to cre-ate a situation where the MPCA would onlyenforce laws that they are ordered to.\" David Priceler of the Minnesota Pork Pro- ducers Association told the committee thathis organization supported the original billwith $400,000 for odor research. The bill's next stop is the House Environ- ment, Natural Resources, and AgricultureFinance Committee.9 April 11, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYFAMILY GAMBLINGWho am I? Members of the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Data Prac-tices grappled April 4 with a bill that wouldmake it easier for adoptees to discover theirorigins. No vote was taken on the proposal. HF727 , sponsored by committee chair Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-FalconHeights), would eliminate a current require-ment that a birth parent be notified beforean adoptee could receive his or her originalbirth certificate. The certificate would revealthe names of an adoptee's birth parents. \"We're about to enter a new century. This is the information age. I don't see how wecan continue to deny adoptees critical infor-mation about themselves,\" said SandraSperrazza of Concerned United Birthparents.\"This is an adoptee's civil right.\" The committee heard passionate testi- mony from people for and against the bill. Atissue was how to weigh an adoptee's right toinformation against birth parents' right toprivacy. A 1977 law requires birth parents to sign an affidavit stating either a willingness orunwillingness to have their identities dis-closed in the event a child should later try tofind them. This would not change under theterms of McGuire's bill. However, the bill poses a big question regarding those who relinquished childrenbefore the 1977 law, when they were prom-ised confidentiality. \"The new law would establish a presump- tion in favor of contact and force birth par-ents to involuntarily relinquish the privacythat was promised to them,\" said CatherineSchendel of the Children's Home Society. McGuire said the issue was one of balanc- ing rights. \"Personally, I think a person has aright to access their own birth certificate.\" But the most compelling testimony came from people who had firsthand experiencewith the adoption process. Sandra Lee Kimble said she struggled for years to find the identity of her birth mother.When she did, \"the first thing she said to mewas, 'were they good to you?' She told methat my finding her was the best thing thatever happened to her,\" Kimble said. She alsolearned crucial information about her ge-netic history that spurred her to get a mam-mogram. The test revealed cancer. \"I wasliterally dying to know the truth,\" Kimblesaid, adding that health considerations areequal to the emotional considerations of thebill. \"I know of no other law or institution in Fathers' registry A bill to register the names of fathers \u2014 or potential fathers \u2014 with the state won ap-proval from the House Health and HumanServices Committee April 9. HF296 , sponsored by Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls), calls upon the Department ofHealth to establish a registry where men whowant to be a part of their children's lives canbe assured of notification if their child is putup for adoption. It's called the putative father's registry. It applies to males (including minors) whomay be fathers but are not married to theirchildren's mother and have not otherwiseestablished paternity. Putative means \"sup-posed\" or \"presumed.\" The registry is a wayto protect a birth father's rights in the eventhis child is put up for adoption, and toprotect children from having adoptions un-duly disrupted. A typical scenario would involve the par- ents of a child who have had little or norelationship beyond the time of conception.The bill would allow a man to register any-time after conception until 60 days after aCard club at the track The House Regulated Industries and En- ergy Committee approved a bill April 8 toallow card clubs to operate at CanterburyPark in Shakopee, Minn. HF967 , sponsored by Rep. David Tomassoni (DFL-Chisholm), would limitwagers during the games to no more than$30 per hand, and specifies a maximum of 50card tables at the track. The track would haveto use some of the revenue for a breeder'sfund and purse payments. The card games would be \"unbanked,\" which means the players would bet againsteach other rather than the \"house.\" The reason for the clubs, according to bill supporters? Horse racing is an ailing stateindustry. In 1986, gross revenue generatedby horse racing in Minnesota reached a peekof $133 million when it began a steady de-cline. In 1996, the total was $64.8 million.The all-time low was $36.3 million in 1994the United States that denies truth to indi- viduals except this one. This is a request thatwe not languish in the dark ages any more.\" One witness said that, in 1973, she gave up a daughter for adoption. \"I knew I wouldnever look for her or interfere in her life.\"But then she received a call from an agencysaying that her daughter wanted to find her.\"It was earthshaking. I was assured privacy.\" Due of the complexity of the issue, com- mittee members plan to consider the billduring the interim and re-introduce it nextsession. \"We'll try to find common ground and look at any compromises,\" McGuire said.\"The people born before 1977 want theirbirth records. Others don't want to give themout. We may be able to come up with someinterim steps to resolve the differences. Thesteps may revolve around the cost and time[that acquiring access can currently de-mand],\" McGuire said. \"But that doesn'tsolve the entire problem. People just wanttheir birth certificates. I personally believeit's information they have a right to. Butthere's still that step that allows someone thepower to say yes or no.\" McGuire added that a possible solution would involve the use of intermediaries tomake initial contacts with birth parents toreduce the likelihood of upset or traumaupon contact.child's birth. He can register without the certainty a conception took place. UnderHF296 , a father could not contest an adop- tion 60 days after the birth, (unless a goodcase is made for failing to register). Registering also would serve as the first step in a paternity claim. The bill says thatwithin 30 days of registering, the father mustfile an intent to claim parental rights with thecourt. That way, he would preserve the rightto maintain an interest in the child and wouldreceive notice of a pending adoption pro-ceeding. A man could use the registry todeny paternity, as well. Listing false infor-mation with the registry would be a misde-meanor. The bill applies only to adoptions \u2014 not to paternity, child support, custody, or otherparental issues. Originally, the proposal limited the op- portunity to register after a birth to just 30days. Some claimed that was not long enough. Wejcman reminded the committee that bonding begins early. \"We want to avoidsituations where a child is ripped out of ahome because a birth father suddenly showsup. We're dealing with [someone who be-comes a father] after a short-term relation-ship. They have 10 months to register if theyhave any interest at all in the child,\" she said,adding, \"They no longer have to rely on theactions of the birth mother.\" HF296 will next be heard by the Health and Human Services Finance Division.10 SESSION WEEKLY / April 11, 1997GOVERNMENT Tracking corporate welfare The Legislature would keep closer tabs on \"corporate welfare\" (tax breaks or other stateaid to businesses) under a bill approved bythe Governmental Operations Committee'sState Government Finance Division April 4. HF1473 , sponsored by Rep. Karen Clark (DFL-Mpls) and Rep. Kevin Knight (R-Bloomington), would create a 19-membercommission to evaluate selected corporatesubsidy programs to ensure that businesseshad used the money effectively. The com-mission would examine tax breaks as well asdirect spending and loans made to the pri-vate sector to encourage economic develop-ment. The commission, Clark said, would make sure the subsidies actually benefited the gen-eral public. \"It's nothing against providing this kind of assistance,\" Clark said. \"It's just saying wewant some type of accountability.\" The bill would require the commission to submit to the Legislature by Dec. 15, 1997, areport of its findings, including any recom-mendations for improved oversight. HF1473 will be included in the committee's omnibus finance bill.(not counting when the track was closed in 1993). In 1986, the state gained $8.9 millionin income from horse racing; in 1996, $1.05million. Supporters say the track is an important commercial entity that supports other eco-nomic interests, including horse breedersand farmers (grain, hay, and straw). It alsoemploys thousands, including security of-ficers, track officials, vendors, food serviceand maintenance workers, and clerical andmanagement staff. The bill is regarded as away to boost attendance and increase rev-enues through a fee that would be chargedfor playing. By one estimate, the track standsto make about $5 million per year. \"This would help the horse racing indus- try simply by allowing people to play pokerwith each other,\" said Cort Holten, whorepresents the Horsemen's Benevolent andProtective Association. Responding to fears that the bill would, in fact, expand gambling in Minnesota, Rep.Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen) said: \"Thecat's already out of the bag as far as gamblingis concerned. I don't see this as an expansion.I see it as a way to do what we already do.\" Earlier this session, the committee ap- proved HF613 , which allows betting on card games such as euchre and pinochle. In thosecases, also, gambling is limited because thehosts can't collect money. HF967 next will be heard on the House floor. GAME & FISH No Indian fishing A bill passed by the House April 7 now is moot due to a federal court ruling. Hoping to forestall tensions when Indians in 12 Minnesota counties began to exercisetheir fishing rights under an 1837 treaty, theHouse voted 114-14 for a $6.5 million bill(SF1645 ) to fund public information and law enforcement efforts in the affected area. But there will be no netting or spearing this spring, due to a ruling April 9 by theEighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In January, a federal court ruled that an 1837 treaty permitted the Indians to hunt,fish, and harvest wild rice off the east-centralMinnesota reservations covered in the treaty.The appellate court put a hold on the Janu-ary ruling, and has agreed to hear argumentson the case June 9. SF1645 , sponsored by Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey), would have, in part, fundedovertime pay and equipment costs had De-partment of Natural Resources (DNR) en- forcement officers been needed at boat land-ings to keep the peace. While the DNR saidthey anticipated no such problems, all par-ties were set on avoiding the violent out-breaks Wisconsin experienced several yearsago. Funds were to have been expended firston an informational campaign to counterinaccurate perceptions of the rights of Indi-ans under the 1837 treaty. Meetings via interactive TV The House Governmental Operations Committee approved a bill April 8 that wouldauthorize legislators to conduct meetings viainteractive television. The technology is liketelephone conference calling with the addi-tion of live video. Meeting participants atdifferent places can talk to and hear eachother through television. Under the bill ( HF829 ), sponsored by Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey), regular, spe-cial, and emergency meetings could be heldvia interactive technology. That means com-mittee members could vote on bills while inlocations other than a legislative committeeroom.HUMAN SERVICES Correction A story on pages 10-11 of the March 28 Session Weekly titled \"Higher education direction,\" misquoted Rep. Betty Folliard,(DFL-Hopkins) who spoke in favor of abill that would set up a commission todesign a master plan for higher educa-tion. The quote read: \"We don't want tohave all the institutions come in withagendas and secret scenarios. That's whatcreates conflict between the systems andthe Legislature.\" What Folliard said in-cluded legislators among those whoshould not have their own scenarios. Weregret the error.Naming the dead A bill to replace the unmarked or num- bered graves of thousands of mentally re-tarded people who died decades ago whilepatients in Minnesota's state hospitals ismoving through the House. The Health and Human Services Com-The House has used the technology in a limited capacity over the past few years, withlegislators meeting in the State Office Build-ing linking to remote locations around thestate. There is currently one House hearingroom equipped for interactive televisionhearings. Rep. Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland) said the bill HF829 would enable legislators to spend more time with their constituency while con-tinuing to conduct legislative business. \"You can have whole groups of people in one place that would have been unable toparticipate,\" said Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls), one of the bill's sponsors, adding thebill could dramatically \"increase participa-tion relative to what people are used to.\" \"One of the problems we have here [at the Capitol] is the inability to reach some con-stituents like the elderly and disabled,\" saidRep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Intl Falls). \"This isan excellent idea.\" The proposal also would apply to other local units of government, such as counties,cities, and school boards. Under the bill, meetings would be open to the public and subject to the same notifica-tion requirements as other meetings. It alsorequires that all participants and observersbe able to see and hear each other. Further, atleast one legislator or member of a localgovernment unit would have to participatefrom the committee's \"home\" location wherethe meeting would normally be held. HF829 now moves to the House floor.11 April 11, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYINSURANCEINSURANCE SPORTSmittee April 9 approved HF1930 which would set aside an as yet undeterminedamount of money to mark grave sites withnames. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul), is on its way to the Healthand Human Services Finance Division wherea dollar figure is expected to be attached. Asimilar bill in the Senate sets aside $100,000. The bill would withhold state dollars until private money, raised to replace the gravesites, has been exhausted. It instructs theDepartment of Human Services to makeefforts to raise private dollars. It also wouldleave unmarked the graves of those whoserelatives object to any changes. State officials estimate that some 9,000 graves are unmarked or numbered at formerhospitals, and it would cost about $2 millionto replace them. The measure is a spin-off of one that failed during the 1996 Legislative Session that calledfor a state public apology to mentally handi-capped people whom the state involuntarilycommitted to state hospitals and later bur-ied in unmarked or numbered graves. Rep. Lynda Boudreau (R-Faribault) urged lawmakers \"to be very cautious about thisbill.\" She said there are data privacy issues inreleasing names, and she added that the leg-islation is not coming from family members.\"This is going to be a very costly endeavor\"to replace all the graves. But other lawmakers saw the issue differ- ently. Rep. Ken Otremba (DFL-Long Prai-rie) called the situation\" and said\"there should be some dignity\" for thosewho died while in the state's care. More MinnesotaCare members A bill that would expand eligibility for MinnesotaCare and abolish the MinnesotaHealth Care Commission was approved April9 by the House Financial Institutions andInsurance Committee. HF1441 , sponsored by Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), would extend MinnesotaCareeligibility to more low-income individualsand couples without children. \"We can afford to cover these people,\" Greenfield said. \"It was always the intentionto expand [eligibility] beyond where we arenow.\" Current law sets a maximum income of 135 percent of the federal poverty line forsingle people ($10,651) and couples withoutchildren ($14,323) to qualify for the state-subsidized health insurance plan. The bill would boost the income limit for those peopleto 175 percent of the poverty level, or $13,807and $18,567, respectively, using 1997 guide-lines. The income limit for MinnesotaCare en- rollees was last increased in 1995, when theLegislature passed a measure lifting the limitfor single people and households withoutchildren from 125 percent of the federalpoverty level to 135 percent. (Current lawsets a cap of 275 percent of the poverty levelfor families with children younger than 21.) In 1996, Gov. Arne Carlson vetoed a bill that would have increased the income limitfor people without children to 150 percent ofthe poverty level. MinnesotaCare is a state-subsidized in- surance plan created in 1992 to extend cov-erage to the uninsured. Enrollees paypremiums based on income and must pro-vide co-payments for some services. Cur-rently, the program serves more than 97,000people. Greenfield's bill also includes a separate provision that would eliminate the Minne-sota Health Care Commission, created bythe 1992 legislation, which advises legisla-tors on health care policy. The request to eliminate the commission came from the commission itself, which ismade up of representatives of business, healthplans, unions, state agencies, and consum-ers. Its members now cite a lack of consensuson health care issues as a reason to dissolvethe commission. \"They have done some very important work for this state and this Legislature, but itdoes seem time\" to eliminate the commis-sion, Greenfield said. HF1441 now moves to the House Gov- ernmental Operations Committee. Jim Pohlad, left, son of Twins owner Carl Pohlad, told the House Local Government andMetropolitan Affairs Committee that his familywas not committed to a $50 million contributionto a new Twins baseball stadium unless a stadiumbill moving through the House is substantiallychanged. Pohlad has called the contribution a \"dealbreaker.\" The bill sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest,right, and Rep. Dan McElroy, was passed by the committee April 9.Stadium revival The House Local Government and Met- ropolitan Affairs Committee, which last weekrejected a bill that would have publicly fi-nanced a new stadium for the MinnesotaTwins, reversed itself April 9 and approved aheavily amended version of the measure by avote of 12-6. The committee revisited the bill, at least in part, at the behest of Gov. Arne Carlson, whourged lawmakers to give the measure the fullconsideration of the legislative process. \"We've been meeting with people over the last week,\" said HF1367 sponsor Rep. AnnH. Rest (DFL-New Hope). \"We've been try- ing to respond to questions and concernsabout the public obligation . . . trying todecrease it.\" The version of HF1367 approved by the committee does, in fact, reduce that obliga-tion. The bill specifically states that the pub-lic authority shall not \"assume any obligationor liability for bonds issued or sold\" to fi-nance the stadium's estimated $400 millionconstruction cost. Moreover, the bill removesfrom the public the obligation to purchasethe team from the Pohlads after 2006. However, HF1367 retains most of the public financing devices outlined in the ver-sion previously rejected by the committee \u2014a special scratch-off lottery game, taxes ontickets, parking and Twins memorabilia,among others \u2014 and requires the Metro-politan Sports Facilities Commission to sellthe old Met Center land. After paying offwhatever debt remains from building theMetrodome, the proceeds from the salewould be applied to the new stadium. The bill also requires the Pohlads to con- tribute $50 million to the effort, a numberJim Pohlad has, in the past, called a \"deal12 SESSION WEEKLY / April 11, 1997TAXES $TRANSPORTATION breaker.\" Indeed, pressed by Rep. Kevin Knight (R-Bloomington), Pohlad once againrefused to commit himself to the amount. \"If you're asking, at this particular time, if we agree to the $50 million, the answer isno,\" Pohlad said. The bill goes now to the House Taxes Committee. Sales tax changes On Feb. 17, the Sales Tax Advisory Coun- cil, after studying the system for more thaneight months, issued its recommendationsfor a more efficient sales tax model. On April 8, the House Taxes Committee accepted those recommendations in the formof HF2066 , sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope). While several of the bill's provisions, such as changing the date of some tax refunds andpermitting some direct tax payments, haveno impact on state revenues, the rest of thebill \u2014 if accepted in its entirety \u2014 wouldcost Minnesota more than one-third of abillion dollars in the 1998-99 biennium. The Sales Tax Advisory Council, which Rest chaired, was created by the 1995 Legis-lature. The 16-member board held a series ofmeetings, taking testimony from the publicabout how to more efficiently administer thesales tax. HF2066 is the result. Although the bill includes an array of sales- tax exemptions, the most costly provision,by far, would change the way vendors paythe state its cut of the gross revenue. As itnow stands, retailers with an annual sales taxliability over $120,000 must estimate theirtax for June and remit at least 75 percent ofthat electronically to the state by June 28.HF2066 would eliminate this annual accel- erated payment. According to an analysis provided by the Department of Revenue, the move wouldcost the state more than $130 million in 1998alone and about $6 million per year thereaf-ter through 2001. The bill also contains a fistful of exemp- tions, including one for the replacement ofcapital equipment. Currently, the state draws a distinction between capital equipment, which is alreadyexempt from sales tax, and replacement capi-tal equipment, which is subject to a declin-ing rate that is administered through a refundmechanism. HF2066 would eliminate this distinction and the refund process, exempting all capitalequipment at the time of purchase, effectiveJune 1, 1997. The revenue department esti- mates this move would cost the state morethan $76 million in the coming biennium. \"Inputs\" used for taxable services, such as laundry, dry cleaning, building maintenance,telephone and cable television, and countryclub dues also would be exempted from thesales tax. Thus, the chemicals used in drycleaning or building maintenance, for ex-ample, would become tax-free. According tothe revenue department estimate, this pro-vision translates into a loss of more than $96million over the next two years. The bill would extend the sales tax to certain items that are now tax-free. For in-stance, unheated, ready-to-eat food, such assandwiches and salads sold at supermarkets,would become taxable as would pre-paidtelephone cards. \"This bill is not an attempt to extend the sales tax, but to apply consistent tax policy,\"Rest said, adding that the changes need to bemade now while the state enjoys a budgetsurplus. The committee retained HF2066 for con- sideration in its omnibus tax bill. Extended filing date The House of Representatives unani- mously approved an emergency measureApril 10 that would give victims of the 1997flood additional time to file their tax returns. \"My heart goes out these people,\" Rep. Dee Long said of HF2132 . \" . . . I think it's the least we can do.\" If enacted, HF2132 , sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy), would allowresidents and businesses located in countiesthat had been declared disaster areas untilMay 30 to file their state tax returns.Seat belt offenses A proposal to allow for tougher enforce- ment of the state's mandatory seat belt lawhas stalled in the House Transportation andTransit Committee. HF1066 , sponsored by Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), would allow police to pull overmotorists who fail to comply with state lawrequiring all front seat occupants to buckleup. Committee members April 9 rejected the plan by an 11-6 margin. Similar legislationintroduced by Greenfield in recent years hasmet the same end. Current law requires all front seat passen- gers to wear a seat belt, but police can onlyissue a citation for seat belt violations afterstopping a motorist for another offense. (Current law also requires children be- tween the ages of three and 11 to wear a seatbelt no matter where they are seated in thecar. Children three and under must be se-cured in child car seats.) Greenfield has pushed to make seat belt violations a primary offense \u2014 allowingpolice to pull over violators \u2014 in hopes ofprompting greater compliance. The Department of Public Safety estimates that 64 percent of Minnesota motorists com-plied with the seat belt law in 1996. Greenfieldsaid his bill would prompt a 15 percent in-crease in compliance. And that, he said, would save lives. Tom Baker and Nancy Mulder testified in favor of a bill that would make not wearing a seat belt a primaryoffense for which police can stop you. The two spoke to the Transportation and Transit Committee April9 about Pat Mulder, their son and friend, who won't be able to graduate with his class because he has torelearn simple tasks after suffering a head injury in a car accident. He was not wearing a seat belt.The bill, which Tunheim said mirrors a federal declaration issued recently by Presi-dent Bill Clinton, goes now to the Senate forapproval.13 April 11, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYGreenfield supports his case with public safety department statistics showing that in1995 car accidents claimed the lives of 239people who were not wearing seat belts andonly 134 people who were. \"There are few people with an opportu- nity to save lives with a single action or asingle word,\" said Christine Krueger, coor-dinator of the Minnesota Safety Belt Coali-tion. \"You have such an opportunity,\" she told members of the committee. But the committee was not swayed. Pro- posals to make seat belt violations a primaryoffense have consistently drawn oppositionfrom lawmakers who are hesitant to givepolice new power to pull over motorists. Greenfield's bill drew little debate before being rejected by the committee. Young farming drivers A bill to ensure that 15-year-olds are al- lowed restricted driver's licenses to help outon the family farm was approved April 9 bythe House Transportation and Transit Com-mittee. HF768 , sponsored by Rep. Torrey Westrom (R-Elbow Lake), would providean exception to a new state law requiringanyone under age 18 to hold a learner'spermit for at least six months before becom-ing eligible for a driver's license. The 1996 Legislature passed the new learner's permit requirements, which tookeffect Feb. 1, 1997, with hopes that the lawwould give teenagers more driving experi-ence before they hit the road on their own. But the law had an unintended side effect, according to Westrom. It cuts in half thetime farm families can benefit from a long-standing state law allowing 15-year-olds toget restricted driver's licenses to help withfarm business. That law allows 15-year-olds whose par- ents are farmers to drive only during day-light hours and only within 20 miles of thefamily farm. Westrom's bill would temporarily exempt 15-year-olds who are eligible for a restrictedfarm driver's license from the new six-monthlearner's permit requirement. The exemp-tion would stay in place until the end of1997. Another change prescribed in the bill would allow eligible 14-year-olds to receivelearner's permits so they can prepare to get afarm driver's license when they turn 15. (Cur-rent law sets age 15 as the minimum age fordriving instruction.) After April 1, 1998, anyone applying for afarm driver's license would be required to have held a learner's permit for six months,under the bill. Westrom's bill now moves to the House floor. Selling abandoned cars Minneapolis and St. Paul police would be required to hold impounded vehicles foronly 15 days before putting them on theauction block, under a bill approved April 9by the House Transportation and TransitCommittee. HF342 , sponsored by Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul), was crafted to address a prob-lem that has Minneapolis and St. Paul im-pound lots overflowing with cars abandonedby their owners. Current state law requires a 45-day wait before an impounded vehicle can be sold.Farrell's bill would exempt Minneapolis andSt. Paul from that law and set a 15-day limitfor those cities. The bill would require local approval by the city councils in Minneapolis and St. Paulbefore it could take effect. Farrell said current law causes real prob- lems in the cities, especially during wintermonths. A winter that brings heavy snowfall\u2014 such as this winter \u2014 leads to a lot ofparking violations and a lot of cars beingtowed from city streets to the impound lot. In St. Paul, where the city impound lot holds 750 vehicles, space in the lot can runout quickly, said St. Paul Police Deputy ChiefTed Brown. Most people pay the fine and pick up their cars from the impound lot within a few days,but others would rather lose their vehicles than pay up, according to Brown. As a result,vehicles that \u2014 in effect \u2014 are abandonedmust be allowed to take up valuable lot spacefor 45 days before they can be sold off. \"The 45-day rule simply makes it too dif- ficult to operate efficiently,\" Brown said. Farrell's bill now moves to the House floor. At a press conference April 9 in the State OfficeBuilding, Giovanna D'Agostino, otherwiseknown as Mama D, urged legislators todedicate more welfare dollars for legalimmigrants cut off by a new federal law. MamaD, a metro area restaurateur, spoke about theobstacles and racism her family faced whenthey immigrated from Italy to this country in1912.Mama D House chamber music Eiji Oue, conductor of the Minnesota Orchestra, and violinist Fleeznis Jorja, right , perform a piece by Mozart for legislators and staff during a recess of the House floor session April 10.14 SESSION WEEKLY / April 11, 1997In less than a year, Minne- sota state employees couldbe asked to take part in apilot project testing the lead-ing edge of modern technol-ogy. It would involve creditcard sized MNCards, which would replace the cards employees now usefor identification, and building and parkingaccess. But the cards also could be used for plac- ing long-distance telephone calls, monitor-ing employee attendance, identifying medicalinsurance coverage and medical informa-tion, making vending machine and cafeteriapurchases, and bank and credit union trans-actions. In the future, they could be insertedin an employee's computer as a means ofaccess and security. All that remains to bedecided. In fact, there's almost no limit to the po- tential information the cards can hold andfunctions they can perform. That's becauseof the 1/2\" square computer chip each cardwould contain. \"This is the next generation\"of cards that currently function by a mag-netic strip, said John Gunyou of the Minne-sota Office of Technology. \"It looks like acredit card, but the chip can hold a ton ofinformation.\" Often called smart cards,they're in limited use around the country,most commonly on college campuses. The goal of the pilot project, in which participation would be strictly voluntary, isto determine which functions people desireand are comfortable using, and to deal withany glitches or drawbacks, he said. \"Thereare a number of issues that have to be workedout regarding security, data, and privacy.That's why we're doing a pilot.\" HF635 , the bill that makes the project possible, was debated extensively in theHouse Judiciary Committee's Data PracticesSubcommittee. On April 8, it was approvedby the House Governmental OperationsCommittee and now rests in the committee'sState Government Finance Division. ( HF635, sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St.Paul), also establishes the North Star gov-ernment on-line service and informationinitiative and sets up a telecommunicationscommunity resource initiative to promoteelectronic information about health care,education, and commerce.) The committee meetings resulted in sev- eral important provisions regardingMNCards, Gunyou said. . . . Smart card debate: privacy versus convenience cardholders have access to the informationon the cards through \"card readers\" at eachparticipating state agency. The bill also sets up a broad-based steering committee to develop the MNCard projectand report back to the Legislature with itsrecommendations. The committee wouldinclude representatives from the MinnesotaOffice of Technology, the Department ofAdministration, the Office of the State Trea-surer, the Information Policy Council, theUniversity of Minnesota (which already usesSmart Cards on campus), Minnesota StateColleges and Universities, health insuranceproviders, financial institutions, state em-ployees, technology groups and other inter-ested parties. \"One key is that groups will decide what will go on the cards and whether sensitive informa-tion will be included,\" Gunyou said. Plus, headded, \"nothing exempts the project from datapractices laws. The law is the law and isn'tchanged by technology.\" The challenge, hesaid, is for the law to keep up with the technol-ogy, which creates new possibilities before lan-guage is on the books to govern it. A larger issue is the implications of the cards' expanded use by the general public inyears to come. Gunyou isn't impressed byfears that the technology threatens personalprivacy. \"People are raising legitimate issuesregarding privacy, but they have to be ad-dressed logically. Some people are opposedto technology in any form. In a few years, thecards will become so common the fears willbe lost,\" he said. \"I think there's some irra-tional Big Brother concerns. But, to me, thecards are a godsend.\" He thinks cards thatcarry medical information, for example,would be life-saving. In his case, Gunyousaid, the cards could inform emergency per-sonnel of his life-threatening allergies.While security enhancement \u2014 personal and professional \u2014 is at the center of thebenefits the cards could provide, accordingto Gunyou, threats to security are the centerof card's drawbacks, according to others. \"It's the whole idea of carrying a card that can have large quantities of personal infor-mation on it that I have to present to strang-ers,\" explained Don Gemberling of the PublicInformation Policy Analysis Division of theDepartment of \"How the That's the biggie.\" Gemberling also said that smart cards present a whole series of difficult securityissues that, without protective measures inplace, could turn the cards into \"bad dream\"cards. \"Will the technology dog wag the privacy tail, or will we finally recognize the right ofprivacy to be the dog and technology to bethe tail?\" Gemberling asks in a report aboutsmart cards. \"Who controls access to thecards? Who controls what goes on the cards?How does the person carrying the card reallyknow what is on [it]?\" Further, he asks, willdriver's licenses end up carrying all that ad-ditional information, as well as welfare ben-efits, social security information, and othersensitive information? Can, for instance, anagency punish someone for not paying a billby \"zapping\" parts of the card's informa-tion? \"I'm not suggesting the whole idea is bad,\" Gemberling said. \"Over time, the cards couldoffer real benefits,\" including Gunyou's ex-ample of medical emergencies, and by re-ducing bureaucracy and the number of cardspeople will have to carry with them. \"But Idon't want my gas station, for instance, tohave access to my medical information.\" But Gunyou said that the level of security provided for any one aspect will match thelevel of security that is needed. He's lookingforward to cards providing users with exclu-sive access to their computer stations andthe ability to conduct business transactionsover the Internet. No one knows whether, if the cards be- come widely used, they would remain vol-untary. Sydney Jensen of the Office of Technol- ogy, said that the project expects about 10,000of the state's 50,000 employees to volunteer.The pilot project would end June 30, 2001. \u2014 Celeste RileyState employees who choose to participate in Minnesota's smart card program may soon carrycards similar to the University of Minnesota'sUCard ( pictured ), which uses a magnetic strip to store data.

He has the honor of hold-ing the shortest gubernatorial termever in Minnesota \u2014 134 days. Although his stint as head of state was short, Petersen stands tall as asymbol of immigrant success, a small-town newspaperman-turned-politi-cian, buoyed by the waves of populismhis immigrant community helpedcreate. His journey from print shop boy at a remote newspaper in northern Min-nesota to head of state in 1936 tookplace during one of the nation's mostexciting times. Industrialization,massive immigration, the First WorldWar, the Depression, and the seeds ofthe Second World War all occurredduring Petersen's professional life.Just as those events played a role inthe strength of the populist move-ment, they contributed to Petersen'stransformation from business-ori-ented Republican to Farmer-Laborrepresentative. Also influencing his political ideals and practices was Petersen's experience asfounder and editor of the Askov American weekly newspaper. Whether it was his weeklycolumn for rural newspapers or his aversionto business and political monopolies,Petersen never lost his journalistic instincts. The literature on Minnesota's 23rd gover- nor is brief. Perhaps that is because he steppedinto the office in August 1936 after the re-vered Gov. Floyd B. Olson died. In Petersen'sfive months in office, he didn't do anythingremarkable \u2014 he called a special session,appointed a state Supreme Court judge, anattorney general and helped settle a fewmetro-area labor disputes. When his termexpired, he chose not to immediately run forre-election. He would, however, run laterbut would not succeed at regaining thegovernor's office. But his contributions to Minnesota span decades before and after his gubernatorialterm. As a state representative from PineCounty from 1930 to 1934, he was a strongFarmer-Labor party member. His secondterm ended 42 years of Republican domi-nance in the House of Representatives andhe was a key player in electing Charles Munnas Speaker of the House. Naming the formerGov. Hjalmar Petersen . . . Income tax sponsor briefly held state's top office Republican to the post drew conservatives tosupport some Farmer-Labor causes and somesay it helped pass the session's most impor-tant piece of legislation \u2014 the state incometax, sponsored by Petersen himself. The state income tax, last debated in the 1891 session, was a controversial measurethat \"in the area of government finance . . .'was to become the single most importantcontribution of the Farmer-Labor party dur-ing its tenure in office,'\" according toPetersen's biography, Hjalmar Petersen of Minnesota , by Steven Keillor. As chairman of the powerful Taxes Com- mittee, Petersen argued the lack of purchas-ing power was at the root of the nation'sproblems. An income tax would bring aid topublic schools and property tax relief tofarmers who, according to the Askov Ameri- can, were paying 20 to 50 percent of their incomes in taxes (compared to 4 percent orless for non-farmers.) Like he did with many issues, Petersen used the pages of his newspaper to promotethe income tax. He refuted the charge that anincome tax would hurt the masses by hurt-ing the wealthy. \"If we have to bow and scrape and be afraid of the millionaires and billionaires . . . and ifwe can't tax them so it will stick under our present form of government thenit is high time to make a right aboutface and change the system,\" Petersensaid, according to Keillor's book. Petersen spoke for independence from Wall Street interests, big gov-ernment, and even media monopoli-zation from his first day in publicoffice as village clerk through his termas governor. His fight for incorpora-tion and thus independence from atownship board won him the clerkpost in Askov in 1918. Years later, heexpressed his independence from bigbusiness by switching from Republi-canism to what he called the \"inde-pendent\" Farmer-Labor Party. \"The farmer by his vote shows that he regards the Farmer-Labor party asthe independent party \u2014 the one thatrepresents the cause of the masses,\"Petersen said. He used the Askov American to oppose U.S. involvement in every war,from World War I to the VietnamWar. As biographer Keillor put it,\"being against war was almost a reli- gion\" for Petersen. And he fought to make changes in the systems \u2014 political and editorial \u2014 of whichhe was a part. He fought against the Farmer-Labor Party's political patronage machine inthe 1936 and 1938 campaigns. He criticizedthe dominance of Knight Ridder and Cowlesmedia companies in Minnesota journalism.He also favored the right to challenge en-dorsed candidates at primaries, seeking toopen up the system to more and purge thesystem of powerful political bosses. Petersen tried more than once \u2014 albeit unsuccessfully \u2014 to round up support foran independent party. Born in Denmark on Jan. 2, 1890, Petersen came to the United States as a baby with hisparents. His father, who had worked hard asa farm laborer to become a small merchant,moved the family to Chicago and soon aftersettled in Tyler, Minn. There, the family waspart of a pioneer community where Danesnumbered high and American culture wasslow to settle in. The language of the OldCountry prevailed and debates over whetherto adopt mainstream American ways werealways under way.

Len Biernat (DFL-Mpls) may be a legislator, but he's also a teacher. The first-term District 59A representative is on thefaculty at Hamline University Law School, where he teaches prop-erty law, family law, andlegal ethics. In fact, hesaid, his experience inthe Capitol makes him amore effective instruc-tor. Take, for example, the revamped anti-stalking legislation that emerged from the House Judiciary Commit-tee at the beginning of the session. Lawmak-ers were forced to revisit the issue after theMinnesota Supreme Court all but erased theversion passed by the 1993 Legislature forbeing overly broad. \"I see that as a marvelous opportunity to show [students] the relationship betweenthe courts and the Legislature \u2014 to illustratethe separation of powers,\" Biernat said, add-ing that the recent effort to recodifyMinnesota's set of landlord/tenant laws alsoprovided a measure of practical insight thathe shared with his students. Of course, the legislator/lawyer nexus works two ways. At virtually every turn,Biernat said, he draws on his legal back-ground in some manner, particularly in hiscapacity as a member of the Judiciary Com-mittee. \"It helps me enormously,\" he said, \"espe- cially in law aspect, for example,New members . . . Biernat unites legal know-how, teaching, lawmaking with the right-to-privacy matters.\" Privacy, he said, is something that has been in the forefront of much of the Judi-ciary Committee's work this session. Theissues surrounding privacy tend to call intoquestion the relationship between citizensand their government, he explained, draw-ing on another academic experience to illus-trate the point. \"I used to bring groups of students over to Norway,\" Biernat said, \"and they have some-thing there called the Data Inspectorate,which is a government agency that makessure all the citizens' records collected bybusiness are complete.\" It is, he said, the Norwegian government's job to examine information on its citizenry. \"It's just the opposite here,\" he said. \"We don't trust the government at all.\" Yet, Biernat is more than just another lawyer turned lawmaker. It could be saidthat politics runs in the family, and that hisrole as a legislator is nothing less than afamily legacy. His father served in the House for eight years, from 1948 through 1956, and the youngBiernat grew up working on campaigns. Hisbrother, Joe, currently serves on the Minne-apolis City Council, and Biernat himself saton the Minneapolis School Board for sevenyears before throwing his hat into the legis-lative ring. That background, Biernat said, gave him the opportunity to get right to work, ratherthan having to spend his first term learningthe ins and outs of the legislative process. District 59A 1996 population: 32,699 Largest Minneapolis Top concern: \"I would rather see education dollars spent where they do the most good . . .improving student performance.\" \u2014Rep. Len BiernatIndeed, for a first-term legislator, Biernat, who also sits on the Education Committeeand its K-12 Education Finance Division,has been exceptionally busy. He has spon-sored, or co-sponsored, more than 60 piecesof legislation \u2014 including one that drewnational attention. \"It's interesting,\" Biernat said of HF446 , his that students' grades to theireligibility for a driver's license. \"I was gettingcalls on that from all over the place. It's justan example of what one legislator can do . . .in terms of getting a good policy discussiongoing.\" Biernat hopes to get many more such policy discussions going, particularly on education,although his legislative priorities have shiftedsince he received his committee assignments.The committee is where the real work isdone. \"It's real intense,\" he said. \"But, I'm a lot.\" F.J.

Bud Nornes (R-Fergus Falls) has gone from broadcasting Minnesota Twins gamesover his own radio station to debatingwhether the team deserves a new outdoor stadium. Now out of the broad- casting business, inwhich he spent 35 years,Nornes said his tenureas a school board mem-ber influenced him torun for the Legislature. \"I believe you always have to have goals . . . and this seemed like a possibility,\" he said. At times, though, the possibility must have seemed distant at best to the former KJJK-AM owner and station manager. Nornes ranfor the District 10A seat twice before. In1992, he lost by fewer than 700 votes, and in1994, he fell short by a mere 73 votes.The decision to try again did not come easily. To become a three-time loser could be embarrassing, he said. Yet, Nornes was notembarrassed. In fact, he won by a substantialmargin in a district where nearly an equalnumber of Republicans and Democrats live. \"I don't regret it,\" he said. \"To have a goal, work hard, and achieve it, well, that's theonly way I'd have it.\"New members a 'rare privilege' Now that he's here, Nornes said his goal is to effectively represent the people of his dis-trict. \"I came into this job without any axes to grind,\" he said, \"or any agenda, other than torepresent my district.\" And the people in his district, he said, pulling out a survey he recently sent to hisconstituents, are concerned with welfare re-form and education. In fact, he continued,the survey showed that 96 percent of the1,500 or so respondents support the notionof requiring able-bodied people to work. The calls he receives reflect the same sen- timent, he said, although lately, he's beengetting a lot of calls from people expressingtheir opinion on the proposed publicly fi-nanced stadium for the Minnesota Twins.For the most part, they're against it, he said. \"Some of them want to keep the Twins,\" Nornes said, adding that the role of govern-ment is to guide the process and find theproper funding mechanism \u2014 which, ac-cording to the people in his district, is onethat doesn't include any public dollars. From all he had heard about life at the Capitol, Nornes said, he expected to spendmost of his first term just learning the ropesof the legislative process. \"Once you're elected,\" he said, \"you hearyou'll be ineffective in your first term. I really didn't find that to be the case.\" In fact, he said, legislating runs in his family. His great-grandfather representedAlbert Lea in 1903. Recently, in betweencommittee hearings and floor sessions, hespent some time in the Capitol, looking atthe portraits of the former governors. Even-tually, he said, he found the governor of hisgreat-grandfather's era. \"It was interesting to learn the issues of that day,\" he said, adding that he hopes tospend more than a single term working onthe issues of his day. \"Fewer than a thousandpeople have served here, and I have the op-portunity to put in a few years . . . it's a rareprivilege that very few Gallagher northwestern Minnesota Top concern: \"To honestly do the best job that I can.\" NornesRep.

That legislator is the chief author whose name appearson the bill along with the bill's filenumber to identify it as it movesthrough the legislative process.There may be up to four co-authors from the House and fourfrom the Senate. Their names alsoappear on the bill.How a Bill Becomes Idea A bill is an idea for a new law or an idea to change an old law. Anyone can suggestan idea for a bill \u2014 an individual, consumer group,professional association, govern-ment agency, or the governor.Most often, however, ideas comefrom legislators, the only oneswho can begin to move an ideathrough the process. There are 134House members and 67 senators.Legal form The Office of the Revisor ofStatutes and staff from other legislative offices work withlegislators in putting the idea for a new law into properlegal form. The revisor's office isresponsible for assuring that theproposal's form complies with therules of both bodies before the billcan be introduced into the Minne-sota House of Representatives andthe Minnesota Senate. General Orders On General Orders, allHouse or Senate members, acting as the \"committee of the whole,\" have a chance to debate the issue, offer amend-ments, and present arguments onthe bill. Afterwards, they vote torecommend: passage of the bill,progress (delay action), or furthercommittee action. And sometimesthey recommend that a bill notpass. Members' votes on GeneralOrders are usually not recordedunless there is a specific request todo so. From here, the bill is placedon the Calendar.Special Orders Toward the end of thesession, the rules commit- tees of the House and Senate designate bills from the General Orders calendar to receivepriority consideration. TheseSpecial Orders bills are debated,amended, and passed in one day.The House also has a Rule 1.10calendar which allows the chairsof the Taxes and Appropriationscommittees to call up for consid-eration any tax or appropriationsbill that has had a second reading.These Rule 1.10 bills are debated,amended, and passed in one day.Calendar The Calendar is a list of billsthe full House and full Senate vote on. At this point, the bill has its third reading. The bill cannot be amended unless the entire bodyagrees to it. Here, representativesand senators vote on the bill forthe last time. A bill needs 68 votesto pass the House and 34 votes topass the Senate. If the House andSenate each pass the same versionof the bill, it goes to the governorfor a signature.9 82 1 319 April 11, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYIntroduction The chief House author of the bill introduces it in the House; the chief Senate author introduces it in the Senate. Identical bills introducedin each body are called companion bills. The bill introduction is calledthe first reading . The presiding officer of the House then refers itto an appropriate House commit-tee for discussion; the same thinghappens in the Senate.Committee The bill is discussed in one or more committees depend-ing upon the subject matter. After discussion, committee members recommend action \u2014approval or disapproval \u2014 to thefull House and full Senate. TheHouse committee then sends areport to the House about itsaction on the bill; the Senatecommittee does likewise in theSenate. Conference If the House and Senate versions of the bill aredifferent, they go to a conference committee. In the House, the speaker of theHouse appoints three or fiverepresentatives, and in the Senate,the Subcommittee on Committeesof the Committee on Rules andAdministration selects the samenumber of senators to form thecommittee. The committee meetsto work out differences in the twobills and to reach a compromise.Governor Once the governor hasthe bill, he or she may: sign it, and the billbecomes law; veto it within three days; or allow it tobecome law by not signing it.During session, the House andSenate can override a governor'sveto. This requires a two-thirdsvote in the House (90 votes) andSenate (45 votes). The governoralso may \"line-item veto\" parts ofa money bill, or \"pocket veto \" abill passed during the last threedays of the session by not signingit within 14 days after finaladjournment. tFloor After the full House, or Senate, accepts the commit-tee report, the bill has its second reading. From here, the bill is usually placed on theHouse and Senate agendas calledGeneral Orders. (A committee canrecommend that a local or non-controversial bill bypass GeneralOrders and go onto the ConsentCalendar where it usually passeswithout debate.) Floor The conference commit-tee's compromise billthen goes back to theHouse and the Senate for another vote. If both bodies passthe bill in this form, it is sent to thegovernor for his or her approvalor disapproval. (If one or bothbodies reject the report, it goesback to the conference committeefor further consideration.)114 56 10 12 a Law in Minnesota20 SESSION WEEKLY / April 11, 19971997 Minnesota House Membership by Seniority * non-consecutive terms House members serve two-year terms.21st term Munger, Willard (DFL)* 13th term Anderson, Lyndon R.

That background shaped Petersen's staunch anti-war sentiments. And nodoubt his provincial ways fueled his ef-forts to keep rural Minnesota informed.During his legislative term, he wrote acolumn on state politics that was carriedby a handful of outstate newspapers. Before winning a legislative election in 1930, Petersen ran unsuccessfully in both1926 and 1928. After his gubernatorialstint, he was elected the state's Railroadand Warehouse Commissioner and lostfour attempts to win the governor's seat.In 1938, he lost the Farmer-Labor guber-natorial primary and in1940 and 1942,he lost the election as the Farmer-Labornominee to Harold Stassen. In 1946, heran in the Republican primary and lostthe governor's race to Luther Youngdahl. Eventually, Petersen was re-elected asrailroad commissioner and served two terms. His last big attempt at electedoffice was against Eugene McCarthy in1958 when he tried but failed to get theDemocratic-Farmer-Labor nominationfor the U.S. Senate. He didn't opposeMcCarthy on ideological grounds butsimply because he loved the political lifeand wanted a part of it again, accordingto his biography. Along with his wife, Medora, Petersen continued to publish the Askov Ameri- can until his death in 1968. Medora con- tinued to write for the paper until shesold it in the 1980s. A political activistherself, she died April 7, 1997, at a nurs-ing home in Willmar, Minn. She was toturn 101 next month. \u2014 Kendall AndersonContinued from page 15MINNESOTA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PUBLIC INFORMATION OFFICE 175 STATE OFFICE BUILDING ST.

But both words can have a major impact on the outcome of certain ideas that get introduced as a bill. After this week's last deadline for bills to be out of committee and headed to the floor for debate, some new and elusive provisions foundtheir way into large omnibus bills, while many legislative studies this session built up a longevity for being studied, introduced, and reshaped, but never made much headway through the entire process. During these proceedings, the Hale-Bopp Comet was observed from the Capitol grounds this week (See cover), and only will be visible in the northern evening sky for a few more days. This Minnesota visitor, probably seen at the cradle of civilization thousands of years ago, is as durable as it is elusive \u2014 as intangible, yet persistent, as the effort to improve on an adequate child care/day care bill ( HF 2147 ), that passed out of the House April 17. (See page 9.) Just when things don't always seem what they appear to be, history repeats itself. Child care received bipartisan support and support from the governor who intro- duced day care legislation back in the early 1970s. And though Hale-Bopp has not been seen for about 4,000 years, a 1997 day care bill some 25 years later is now more refined, more inclusive, and finally prepared for passage into law. Likewise, this week longevity and elusiveness reappeared for Minnesota's elder statesman and former governor, Harold E. Stassen (See page 16), who was 90 years old on April 13. The perennial candidate for U.S. president is the last living signer of the United Nations Charter. Three times elected as governor of the state, the statesman shares the same birthday as another well-known signer of a famous document, Thomas Jefferson. History does repeat itself. Jefferson, a lawyer like Stassen, also served as governor (of Virginia) and was 36 years old in his first term. Stassen was 36 years old in his last term. Jefferson, too, ran for the U.S presidency, but he won; the nation's highest office was not elusive to him. But Stassen's longevity is as acknowledged as Jefferson's. Their presence is a positive continuance. Jefferson would have celebrated 254 years with Stassen last Sunday. His impressive contributions to the basic foundations of the country are, in part, why reasonable solutions to adequate child care were passed by the Legislature. Longevity and elusiveness came together this week in different ways: to fully fund child care \"for the next 100 years,\" according to one of the supporting legislators ofthe bill; to honor the legacy of one of Minnesota's great elder statesmen; and to give a striking photographic finish to a celestial visitor, millions of miles above the State Capitol dome. \u2014 LeClair G. Lambert3 April 18, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . April 10 - 17, 1997 Highlights Abill advancing in the House would provide $6.7 billion in state aid for education, lengthen the school year for all public schools, and provide new initia- tives to help students who fail the state's graduation tests. HF1684 , sponsored by Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee), would provide a total in- crease in state spending for K-12 education of 13.5 percent. (When enrollment growth is factored out, the proposed funding increasestands at 7.4 percent .) The omnibus K-12 education finance bill would spend about $225.4 million more than Gov. Arne Carlson proposed for the 1998- 1999 biennium. Some of the governor'smajor education initiatives \u2014 including his plan to provide increased tax deductions and new tax credits for parents who send their children to private schools \u2014 are not included in the bill. However, the bill does include provisions that would target funds to assist struggling students, improve school bus safety, and allow for the creation of more charter schools and new laboratory schools. The bill was approved by the House Edu- cation Committee April 14 and by the House Taxes Committee April 17. It now moves to the House Ways and Means Committee. Here's a look at some of the major provi- sions of the omnibus bill. Formula increases A total of $5 billion would be devoted to general education funding for school dis-tricts during the two-year budget cycle. The proposal would outspend the governor's rec- ommendations for general education fund- ing by $52 million. The bill would provide increases in per- pupil funding for each year of the biennium. Districts currently receive $3,505 per pupil. The bill would add $75 in 1998, bringing the sum to $3,580. (Per-pupil funds are distrib- uted according to \"weighted\" attendancecounts, which provide more revenue for sec- ondary students than for elementary stu- dents.) In 1999, another $8 would be added, andK-12 school funding . . . Omnibus bill stresses technology, standards, safety other changes would impact the general edu-cation funding formula during that year. District cooperation funds that districts nowreceive separately would be rolled into the per pupil funding, but revenue for transpor- tation and teacher training would be rolled out. The result is that the per-pupil amount would dip to $3,355, but districts wouldshow a net gain in dollars. Hardware, hard cash The bill includes a total of $86.8 million to improve technology in schools and publiclibraries statewide. A provision in the bill would require each school district to create a technology plan to serve as a road map for future investments in computer equipment and related items. Theplan would describe which computer skills will be taught, how technology will be inte- grated into the curriculum, and how tech- nology will aid implementation of the state's graduation standards. It also would have toprovide an inventory of existing technologi- cal resources and detail the district's plans for hardware and software investment. Among other items to be included arehow each district plans to ensure that the technology is accessible to special-needs stu- dents and to involve private business, highereducation institutions, and other parties in developing and supporting the use of tech- nology use in the classroom. Each district would be required to submit its technology plan to the Department ofChildren, Families and Learning for review. The bill would provide $30 million for one-time grants to help school districts pur- sue improvements consistent with their tech- nology plan. The $30 million would bedistributed to districts on a per-pupil basis. Another $20 million in grant funding would be available on a competitive basis according to the needs of individual dis- tricts. Districts would have to provide match-ing funds to receive a share of the $20 million, and the grant funds would have to be spent in a manner consistent with each district's technology plan. The bill also would provide another $19 million for telecommunication access grants to help school districts and regional public libraries get connected to the Internet.The House's omnibus K-12 education finance bill has many provisions that could affect Mrs. Adams' fourth grade class at Snail Lake Elementary School in Shoreview. The proposal provides a 13.7 percent boost in K-12 funding overall, with millions in spending marked for technology and school bus safetyinitiatives.4 SESSION WEEKLY / April 18, 1997Help for skills tests Students who fail or are at risk of failing the state's basic skills tests required for high school graduation would be eligible for re- medial efforts to provide them more time in the classroom. A total of $52 million would be earmarked to provide the equivalent of three weeks additional classroom time for students who fail the basic skills tests or are likely to fail. The additional hours could be logged after school, during weekends, or during thesummer. In 1996, the state began giving basic skills tests in reading and math to eighth grade students, who must pass the tests before they are eligible to graduate from high school.The tests are administered once each year. Statewide, eighth graders given the test in January 1997 experienced high rates of fail- ure, with 41 percent failing in reading and 30 percent failing math. Results in 1996 weresimilarly disappointing. Funds to extend classroom time would be distributed to school districts according to a formula that takes into account the number of students in the district who are receivingfree lunches. More time in school All students would spend three more days in the classroom, under the bill. Current law sets no minimum for the number of days in a school year, but most districts schedule about 170 days of instruc- tion. The bill would require all districts to add three days of instruction during the 1997- 1998 school year. No additional funding would be provided to districts for the three extra days. Most districts already contract with teach- ers for more than 180 days. The bill would simply require that more of those days be used for classroom instruction, leaving fewer days available for training and other activi- ties. School bus safety The bill would provide increased funding to school districts for school bus safety im- provements that could include retrofittingbuses with seat belts and placing adult safety monitors on some buses. A total of $6.9 million would be provided to districts for transportation safety fund- ing. That would more than double theamount currently dispersed to districts on a per-student basis. A total of $4 million included in that sum would be designated for any of the five follow- ing safety purposes: adding seat belts onbuses, providing adult safety monitors, in- stalling video cameras, installing crossingarms, or adding exterior strobe lights. Adult safety monitors and video cameras are billed as effective methods of improving discipline on buses and making it easier for bus drivers to concentrate on the road. Themonitors also can assist drivers in emer- gency situations. Crossing arms help to protect children getting on and off buses, and exterior strobe lights help to improve the visibility of busesstopped to pick up or drop off students. Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Park) sponsored separate legislation this year aimed at improving school bus safety, and she suc- cessfully pushed to have the additional $4million in funds for specific safety measures included in the omnibus bill. (Art. 1, Sec. 69) Luther's proposal was given additional urgency after an April 9 traffic accident in- volving a school bus headed for a Monticello,Minn., elementary school. Three children were killed and 13 others were injured when a truck collided with the children's bus. School choices The governor's 1997 education recom- mendations called for a variety of changes to increase the school choices available to stu- dents and parents. In addition to his call for tax credits and expanded tax deductions for private school tuition, Carlson proposed changes to in- crease the number of charter schools in the state and to support the creation of labora- tory schools, which are schools run underthe auspices of colleges or universities. The governor recommended that the state provide $7.3 million in charter school start- up grants, $2.6 million in charter school lease aid, and $10 million for laboratoryschools. The omnibus bill would not provide the funding Carlson sought for charter schools, and the bill would provide exactly half of what he recommended for laboratoryschools. However, the bill does include the governor's recommendation to remove a provision in current state law capping the number of charter schools allowed in Min-nesota at 40. And the bill would make it easier for exist- ing schools to convert to charter school sta- tus. Current law requires 90 percent of teachers at an existing school to vote in favorof making the site a charter school. The bill would change state law to allow such a change as long as a simple majority of teachers favor the move. Another provision in the bill would in-crease the amount of state aid that follows a student to a charter school rather than hav-ing the funds remain with the student's home district. Such a change could significantly benefit the coffers of charter schools. The bill's $5 million for laboratory schools would provide grants to at least three post-secondary institutions for establishing schools designed to foster innovative teach- ing techniques. Grant funding for laboratory schools would be available to public or private postsecondary institutions. Statewide testing The bill would provide $5 million for the implementation of a statewide testing sys-tem designed to measure educational out- comes and foster accountability in public education. Separate legislation passed earlier this year and signed into law by the governor requiresthat the state begin uniform statewide test- ing during the 1997-1998 school year. However, that law ( CH1 ) does not pre- scribe exactly how the statewide testing sys- tem will work. A special joint committee wascreated by the House and Senate to develop the framework for the statewide testing sys- tem, and the results of that committee's work are expected to be considered in separate legislation. (Statewide testing has been touted by sup- porters as a way to increase accountability in public schools by providing a reliable mea- surement of student and school performance that can be compared to results from otherdistricts and states.) The House omnibus bill does not address specific characteristics of the new statewide testing requirement, such as who will be tested and what kind of test will be used. Butthe bill does address how the results of state- wide testing would be used to gauge school performance. Under the bill, test results from 1997-1998 would be used to establish a baseline for eachindividual school. The future performance of each school would then be evaluated ac- cording to its baseline. The bill also would require the statewide testing system to include rewards for schoolsthat show improvement and assistance for schools that do not. Superintendent salaries A provision in the omnibus bill would permit larger school districts to pay their superintendents more than current state law allows. Existing state law caps the salary of school superintendents at 95 percent of the5 April 18, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYgovernor's $114,506 annual salary. Some school districts have complained that thecap hurts their ability to compete with dis- tricts in other states for top superintendent candidates. Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), who backed the plan to allow certain districts toexceed the cap, said the proposal would al- low local school boards to better compete for top superintendents and to set the salary for the position according to what is acceptable within the community. Under the bill, any district with more than 5,000 students would be allowed to exceed the current salary cap, but only if the super- intendent achieves performance incentives included in his or her employment contract. Contract incentives would have to include goals for improving student achievement and could include other factors such as cur- riculum improvement and student atten- dance. The salary cap for superintendents has been in place since 1983, and several legisla- tive attempts to repeal the cap in recent years have failed. Later starts A total of $500,000 would be devoted to grants to help school districts that establish school starting times of 8 a.m. or later. Advocates of later start times say adoles- cent students benefit greatly when they are allowed to get a bit more sleep before the school day begins. Better rested students are more prepared to learn and less likely to be disruptive in school, proponents claim. The case for later start times is supported by a Minnesota Medical Association report showing that adolescents need more sleep \u2014 at least 9.5 hours a night \u2014 than younger children or adults. And, according to thereport, adolescents naturally experience a delayed sleep pattern, which means they are unable to fall asleep as early as adults or younger students. Supporters also argue that later start times can help to alleviate some of the problems arising when teenagers are released from school early in the afternoon \u2014 often as early as 2 p.m. \u2014 and left unsupervised. Earlier in the session, lawmakers consid- ered a proposal backed by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul) that would have required all students in grades 7 to 12 to start classes no earlier than 8 a.m. Critics of Entenza's pro- posal said it amounted to state micro-man-agement of local affairs and that it would be problematic and expensive for many dis- tricts. The bill would not mandate that schoolsmove to an earlier start time. It would simply provide grants to help cover increases intransportation costs in districts that elect to make the change. Funds included in the bill would be di- vided into grants of $50,000 to help 10 dis- tricts with transportation costs related tolater start times. Breakfast at school A total of $500,000 would fund a pilot program testing the benefits of providingbreakfast to students at designated elemen- tary schools, regardless of the students' eco- nomic status. Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park) backed the breakfast program as a wayto help improve student learning. Her sup- port centered on the belief that students who come to school hungry are unable to con- centrate on learning. Concerns have been raised about the ben- efits of programs that provided breakfast only to poor students because the stigma attached to participating in such programs may have kept many children away, accord- ing to Johnson. Under the bill, schools receiving grant funding would be required to make break- fast available to all students every school day. However, only schools with at least 33 per- cent of students on free and reduced-pricelunch programs would be eligible for grant funding. Stopping hazing The bill would require new policies to be developed aimed at preventing hazing among students. Earlier this session, a Roseville mother and her daughter urged lawmakers to take action to deter hazing. The daughter hadbeen a victim of hazing while a student at Roseville Area High School, and she told legislators that the event was traumatic and dangerous. The girl claims the school did too little to prevent the hazing before it took place and did not respond appropriately when she re- ported it afterwards. Under the bill, the Department of Chil- dren, Families and Learning would be re-quired to develop a model anti-hazing policy to be made available to districts. Local school boards would have to adopt a written anti- hazing policy. District anti-hazing policies would apply to student behavior on and off school grounds and during and after school hours. The poli- cies would have to include disciplinary pro- cedures severe enough to deter students fromparticipating in hazing. Districts would be required to include their anti-hazing policies in the student hand- book and to post the policies in conspicuous places in the schools. The bill also would require that student hazing be included among the topics cov-ered in each schools' violence prevention curriculum. Dropping out The bill includes a provision that would alter the state's compulsory attendance law. Currently, the state requires anyone age 7 to 16 to be enrolled in school, but a change set to take effect for the 2000-2001 school year would expand compulsory attendanceto include everyone age 7 to 18. The bill would allow students ages 16 to 18 to withdraw from school if they follow pro- cedures designed to inform them of other available educational opportunities. The student and his or her parent or guard- ian would be required to meet with school personnel to discuss options such as alterna- tive secondary programs, charter schools, and schools in other districts. If the student does not elect to continue in an alternative setting, the student and a parent or guardian would be required to sign a statement confirming the student's decision to drop out. Internet pornography Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka) urged adoption this year of a requirement that schools use blocking software to shield chil-dren from obscene material on the Internet, but the omnibus bill would not go that far. Critics of the plan to mandate the use of blocking software claim the technology is imperfect and that it denies Internet usersaccess to useful information. For example, software designed to block sites related to sex can be effective in denying access to pornography, but it also can block sites related to sexual harassment, sexualdiscrimination, and other legitimate research topics, according to critics of Weaver's pro- posal. The bill would require the Department of Children, Families and Learning to developa model policy for Internet access and use. Each school district would be required to adopt an official Internet use policy within one year of when the department's model policy is prepared. The department also would be required to evaluate and recommend blocking software to prevent access to obscene or sexually6 SESSION WEEKLY / April 18, 1997explicit materials, but use of such software would not be mandated. Dial-a-teacher The bill would provide $350,000 to keep the Minnesota Homework Helpline up and running for two more years. The Homework Helpline is a statewide service giving students toll-free access to teachers who can provide assistance on a wide range of academic topics. The service faced a financial crisis earlier this year and was just days away from shut- ting down when Target Stores stepped up to provide $58,000 to keep the help line going through the 1996-97 school year. The $350,000 included in the bill would be directed to the Southeast Service Coopera- tive, which manages the help line, and would cover the help line's operating expenses for the biennium. Another provision in the omnibus bill would provide $250,000 to support the Metro Hotline for Homework, a separate service that assists students via the telephone or other interactive technology. \u2014 Nick Healy Rich Scherber is the executive director of Minnesota Teen Challenge, a Minneapolis-based program in which adolescents involved in drugs, prostitution, or gangs receive job trainingskills and learn to live structured lives. He introduced House members to a choir composed of current program participants April 17, after which the students sang a spiritual song.BUSINESSSALESDEVELOPMENT Challenge choirUnauthorized switches It's called slamming. A long-distance tele- phone company switches a customer's ser- vice without the customer's knowledge orapproval. The methods can include sending a check, a sweepstakes form, or a survey. What the individual or business often doesn't realize is that by participating or signing, they've authorized the switch. HF1123 , sponsored by Rep. Mike Delmont (DFL-Lexington), would label slamming as consumer fraud, and authorize the attorney general's office to take action at a customer's request. The bill was passed by the HouseApril 14 on a 132-0 vote. The bill says that it is fraudulent to change a customer's service without the customer's verified consent, and that it is the responsi- bility of the telephone company to proveconsent. \"If there's any question\" on the customer's part about the switch being legally autho- rized, \"the company has to have an authori- zation in writing,\" Delmont said. A 1996 law required that a long-distance company reinstall a customer's original ser-vice at no charge and then re-bill the cus- tomer at a lower rate if the original chargeswould have been cheaper. The new bill adds that the company could be required to ab- sorb the long-distance costs accrued while the unauthorized service was in effect. The bill now goes to the Senate. Economic development A $376.6 million omnibus economic de- velopment bill sets aside money over the 1998-1999 state budgeting period for a di- verse group of state agencies, from the Min-nesota Historical Society to the Department of Economic Security. A draft of the bill won approval from the Economic Development and International Trade Committee April 16. The provisionsof the bill were later combined with the omnibus housing bill, which now moves to the House Ways and Means Committee as HF2158 . Among the economic development bill's provisions is a $10 million appropriation to help Minnesota's welfare families train for jobs. Federal law now requires families to work to receive public assistance. The bill also sets aside $10 million to help redevelop vacated, contaminated industrial land, known as brownfields, so new busi- nesses can move in and create jobs. The money would not be used for the cleanup ofthe contaminated land (a separate fund does that). Instead, the predevelopment and jobcreation grant program would pay costs such as land acquisition, demolition of existing structures, and relocation of individuals or businesses. Minnesota's film industry also would get a $1 million boost. The money would go to the Minnesota Film Board to establish a film production jobs program. It would pay pro- ducers of long-form and narrative films who directly create new film jobs in Minnesota.The Department of Trade and Economic Development would oversee and authorize the payments. Projects not receiving funding in the bill include the Minneapolis Convention Centerand the St. Paul Civic Center. The Minne- apolis Convention Center had asked for $37.5 million to help expand its facilities and make it more competitive nationally. The St. Paul Civic Center had asked for $51 million instate bonds to help renovate the Civic Center in the hopes of attracting a professional ice hockey franchise. Gov. Arne Carlson had recommended $4 million in funds for the Civic Center but the Economic Develop-ment Finance Division, which put the bill together, opted for no money. Below is a listing of some of the bill's other provisions. $4 million would go to the Minnesota Youth Program which provides services year-round for young people between the ages of 14 and 21. That dollar figure is above the state base funding of about $67 April 18, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYmillion. Participants receive education, skills training, and other support serviceson an individual basis. They receive aca- demic enrichment designed to improve reading and math skills. $100,000 would go to Mankato State Uni- versity to establish a rural policy and devel-opment center to research issues affecting rural Minnesota, encourage collaboration across higher education institutions to help with problem solving, and provide a re- source center for rural communities. $1 million would go to certain Minnesota cities in the form of grants to help combat teen curfew violations, truancy, and gang infiltration. $300,000 would go to the Minnesota His- torical Society to distribute locally for Minnesota's territorial sesquicentennial and millennium celebrations. $250,000 would go to Ramsey County to expand the Sister-to-Sister mentoring pro-gram which pairs former welfare mothers with those currently on welfare to help them move off public assistance. The county would be required to match the money. $25,000 would go to study the feasibility of a state museum to house fishing-related artifacts, equipment, and memorabilia. The Minnesota Historical Society must present study recommendations to the Legislature. ENVIRONMENT Environmental spending bill State spending for environment and agri- culture programs would total almost $624 million over the next two-year budget cycle, under a bill approved by the Environment,Natural Resources and Agriculture Finance Committee April 14. HF2150 , sponsored by Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul), funds the Department of Natural Resources (DNR), the MinnesotaPollution Control Agency (MPCA), the Min- nesota Zoo, the Department of Agriculture, and several other state agencies. A little more than 62 percent of the state spending in the bill \u2014 almost $388 million\u2014 would go to the DNR. The MPCA, the next largest recipient under the bill, would receive about $83 million. The Department of Agriculture would get $52.4 million. The spending bill also includes nearly $37 million for 89 environmental and recre- ational programs selected by the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCMR), which is funded from a two-cent-per-pack cigarette tax and limited state lot- tery proceeds. The bill also would abolish theLCMR and transfer its authority to the House Environment, Natural Resources and Agri- culture Finance Committee and the Senate Environment and Agriculture Budget Divi- sion (See related story, page 8). HF2150 now moves to the House Ways and Means Committee. Other provisions of the bill include: State parks, trails, recreation Funding for state parks and recreation areas would total more than $57.5 million, a spending increase of $3.5 million over the previous two-year budget. A total of $9 million \u2014 $4.5 million each year \u2014 would go to acquire land and im- prove the metropolitan regional park sys- tem. Nearly $5.1 million would go to expand and improve state park and recreational areas. (An additional $7 million from theLCMR would supplement the funds for metropolitan and state parks.) New connections costing $1.2 million would be added linking the Willard Munger Trail to North St. Paul High School propertyand to the city of Roseville trail system. An- other $800,000 would be appropriated for other state trail improvements. The LCMR budget also includes $1 mil- lion for new trail acquisition. Ethanol production The bill would appropriate $52.4 million \u2014 $27.4 million in fiscal year 1998 and $25 million in fiscal year 1999 \u2014 for agricultureprograms. Of that amount, $44.6 million would subsidize ethanol producers over the two-year period. Ethanol is made from the fermentation of corn and other agricultural products andhas been used as an additive in gasoline to make it burn more cleanly. There are currently six major ethanol plants in Minnesota that produce a total of 92 million gallons of ethanol per year. Thatis still short of the 120 million gallon state goal which would allow Minnesota to be- come ethanol self-sufficient. The state still imports ethanol from plants in Illinois, Iowa, and Nebraska. Since October 1995, automobiles in the 10-county metropolitan area have been re- quired to burn \"oxygenated fuel\" year round. (The law was enacted in 1991 because the Twin Cities was in violation of federal Envi-ronmental Protection Agency clean air re- quirements. Adding one part ethanol for every 10 parts of gas is one way to oxygenate gas.)Beginning Oct. 1, 1997, all gasoline sold in the state will have to be oxygenated, whichwill further increase demand for ethanol. Snowmobile trails Minnesota's snowmobile trail fund has an operating deficit of $2.5 million for the 1997fiscal year, according to a report from the Minnesota Snowmobile Advisory Commit- tee. Dennis Asmussen, director of Trails and Waterways for the DNR, testified at a Janu- ary committee hearing that the state's Snow-mobile Trail Enforcement Account has not been adequate to operate and maintain the existing 18,047 mile trail system. At the same time, the number of regis- tered snowmobile users in the state increased41 percent over the past 10 years. Today's snowmobiles are bigger and more powerful than when many of the state's snowmobile trails were built. The bill would appropriate $5.1 million each year for snowmobile trails and enforce- ment. Most of the money would go to local snowmobile clubs to pay for trail grooming under the state grants-in-aid program. Fish and wildlife More than $86.5 million would be spent in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 on programs for lake, stream, and wildlife area manage- ment. Nearly $2 million would be marked for non-game wildlife management programs. Another $2.7 million would be marked to fund game and fish critical habitat programs and wetlands protection under the Reinvestin Minnesota (RIM) program. The LCMR recommendations add another $3.2 million for RIM programs. Clean air and water The MPCA would continue existing pro- grams to clean up Minnesota lakes and rivers with $23.3 million in state funds, under the bill. It would receive another $15.4 million for air pollution programs, and almost $31.2million for protection of groundwater and management of solid waste. Agricultural potpourri Other agriculture programs that would be funded include: $8.3 million for the Agricultural Utilization Research Institute, including $150,000 for marketing a value-added agricultural prod- uct by a community-based youth program,and $200,000 each year to develop a pro- gram for hybrid tree plantations. $1 million for teams of dairy experts to provide professional consulting services to8 SESSION WEEKLY / April 18, 1997small- and medium-sized dairy farms; $500,000 for the University of Minnesota to study livestock odor and low-emission alternative management techniques for swine farrowing and feeder pig produc- tion; and $700,000 for the Board of Animal Health, including $40,000 to identify cattle herds infected with para-tuberculosis or \"Johne's disease\" and $89,000 for the University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medi- cine for a companion animal resource edu-cation program. Lottery funding unstuck The third time was a charm for a bill to extend the dedication of state lottery rev- enue for environmental purposes. HF113 won approval from the House Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Finance Committee April 14. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth), would extend thededication of 40 percent of net lottery pro- ceeds to the trust fund for environmental projects until the year 2020. Under the Min- nesota Constitution, that dedication is set to expire in 2000. As originally written, the billextended the fund dedication until 2050. HF113 also would allow up to 25 percent of the annual revenues deposited in the en- vironmental fund to be used for land acqui- sition and development until 2020. Munger'soriginal bill would have authorized such ex- penditures only through fiscal year 1997. Changes made to the original bill led Munger to withdraw the proposal on two previous occasions, stalling its progress forweeks. This time around, everyone was agree- able. Munger said that while he dislikes the amendments, he still wants the bill to move forward. Greta Gauthier, director of the En- vironmental Trust Fund Coalition, said hergroup supports extending the lottery dedi- cation for as long as possible, but is not committed to a specific date. According to a report from the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources(LCMR), the lottery has contributed $149 million to the trust fund since it began in 1991. The fund is currently worth about $140 million. Given stable lottery sales, the LCMR projects that the trust fund will reach$1 billion in assets by 2016. To date, the trust fund has contributed approximately $60.5 million to 87 environ- mental projects. Forty more projects are pro- posed for 1998-99, which would increasetotal trust fund expenditures to about $81 million.The bill now goes to the House Ways and Means Committee. Changes to state parks Land would be added to four state parks, an additional park would get a new name, and another would be allowed to sell beer in its lodge, under a bill passed by the HouseApril 14. The vote was 118-15. HF299 , sponsored by Rep. Tom Bakk (DFL-Cook), authorizes the Department of Natural Resources to add land to the follow- ing state parks: Bear Head Lake State Park in St. Louis County which would add 160 acres of ad- jacent undeveloped land, wooded with ma- ture red and white pine trees. The addition would prevent a proposed housing devel-opment near the Taconite State Trail. Forestville State Park in Fillmore County which would get an adjacent 40-acre par- cel on the south branch of the Root River. The river is a designated trout stream andthe surrounding bluffs contain excellent habitat for the endangered timber rattle- snake. John Latsch State Park in Winona County which would gain access to the MississippiRiver with a 120-acre parcel that includes privately owned water access, a resort, and campground. The resort would continue to be privately operated under contract with the state. Split Rock Lighthouse State Park in Lake County which would acquire 80 acres of land along the Lake Superior shore north- east of the park. The land is currently owned by the Congdon family and includes GoldRock Point, the largest of the few exposed granite cliffs on the North Shore. It also contains 3,700 feet of lake shore and access to the Madeira shipwreck, one of the most popular diving sites in the Great Lakes. The bill also would change the name of O.L. Kipp State Park in Winona County to Great River Bluffs State Park. O.L. Kipp is the first state park encountered by travelers entering the state from the east on Interstate90. Great River Bluffs is a more descriptive name that park officials believe will attract more tourists to the park. Another provision of the bill would allow Itasca State Park in Clearwater County toadd beer to the wine menu in its restaurant. And visitors to Tettegouche State Park would be allowed to use the parking lot for one hour without buying a state park permit. The bill now moves to the Senate.LCMR changes The Legislative Commission on Minne- sota Resources (LCMR) may soon be no more. An amendment added to the House Environment, Natural Resources and Agri- culture Finance Committee's omnibus bill (HF2150 ) April 14 would technically elimi- nate the commission, often a source of con- troversy. The LCMR, established in 1963, comprises 16 legislators; half House members and half senators. The commission draws on fourstate revenue sources and recommends fund- ing for projects to enhance and protect the state's natural resources. LCMR recommen- dations are developed through an extensive public review process including input froma variety of individuals and groups inter- ested in the environment. The recommen- dations then must be adopted by the Legislature. Last year the commission rec- ommended projects totaling $36 million instate spending. The amendment, offered by Rep. Mark Holsten (R-Stillwater), would replace the LCMR membership with the House Envi- ronment, Natural Resources and Agricul-ture Finance Committee and the Senate Environment and Agriculture Budget Divi- sion. In all 27 members sit on the commit- tees. Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth), chair of the House Environment and Natural Re- John Velin, director of the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources (LCMR), listened April 14 as the Enviroment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Finance Committee approved anamendment that would significantly alter the composition of the LCMR. The panel recommends the spending of tens of millions of state dollars for environmental projects throughout the state.9 April 18, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY FAMILYsources Committee and a member of the LCMR, said that the commission is doingjust fine. He characterized the Holsten amendment as a power grab by the finance committee and said such a policy change should first go through the Environment and Natural Resources Committee, whichhe chairs. Holsten argued that his amendment would leave the current public advisory process and support staff in place but put the deci- sion-making authority in the hands of agroup more geographically and ideologi- cally diverse than the LCMR. The current LCMR is composed of 12 DFLers and four Republicans. The proposal would make it a 16-11 DFL majority. The omnibus bill now moves to the House Ways and Means Committee. Early childhood funding A bill that sets aside a record $200 million to pay for the child care needs of welfare and working-poor families passed the HouseApril 17. The vote was 122-11. The measure also would pay some parents to stay at home with their newborns for the first year of life. In all, the omnibus early childhood and family education bill ( HF2147 ) would spend $393.6 million over the state's 1998-1999 two-year budgeting period. Sponsored by Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL- Park Rapids), the bill, in addition to childcare, appropriates money for programs such as early childhood education, community education, after school programs, adult ba- sic education, Head Start, food shelves, and homeless shelters. The more money the state invests in its children early in life, \"the easier it will be on all of our budgets\" later on, said Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) referring to the cost of Minnesota's judicial and wel-fare budgets. Providing the dollars for child care is in the state's best interest, lawmakers say. Un- der a new federal welfare law, states are pun- ished for not moving their welfare parents towork. Specifically, Minnesota could lose millions in federal aid. Logically, if Minne- sota expects its welfare parents to work, child care assistance is essential. Part of the $200 million for child care \u2014 $98 million \u2014 would pay for the child care needs of welfare parents now required to work under federal law. The new work re-quirement is expected to move another 12,500 Minnesota children into day care overthe next few years. About $89.5 million would be placed in an existing program that helps low- and mod- erate-income working families pay for child care using an income-based, sliding fee scale.There are currently about 5,600 Minnesota families on a waiting list for the program, which is called Basic Sliding Fee child care. The money in the bill is expected to elimi- nate most, if not all, of the waiting list. Another $2 million would be used to ad- minister the programs. The remaining $410,000 would be spent to encourage stay- at-home parenting for some low- and mod- erate-income families. In effect, it would payparents on the Basic Sliding Fee child care program to stay at home with their child for the first year of life. Eligible families already would have had to qualify for the Basic Sliding Fee programand received child care help for at least 30 days. They'd receive 75 percent of the aver- age cost of licensed family home day care for an infant in their county. The bill instructs the Department of Children, Families andLearning to begin the program by March 1, 1998. The Basic Sliding Fee program has be- come a vital part of the state's effort to trim its welfare rolls. Without the program, thecost of child care can often push a working poor family onto welfare. An unsuccessful attempt to delete the stay-at-home provision was sponsored by Rep. Ron Kraus (R-Albert Lea) who said thattough choices needed to be made. While Kraus said he didn't feel the program was a bad idea, he thought it best to pay parents who want to work. Rep. Richard Mulder (R-Ivanhoe), who sponsored the stay-at-home provision, de- fended the measure by noting that the first three years of life are vital in a child's devel- opment into a healthy, productive adult. Having one parent stay home to raise thechild would prevent societal problems later. \"The little baby benefits the most . . .\" Mulder said. Other unsuccessful amendments included one to cut programs in the bill by 1 percentacross the board and another to cut child care funding by $10 million to save the tax- payers money. Below is a listing of some of the bill's highlights. $10 million would be spent to encourage people to enter the child care profession by offering forgivable loans for course work and training. A portion of the money also would be used to expand child care facili-ties. All of this is in preparation for the expected onslaught of new children into day care. Based on past experience, more children in day care will mean an esti- mated 90 more child care centers, 650 morefamily child care homes, and 3,875 more legal unlicensed relatives and neighbors to take care of the children are needed, ac- cording to the Department of Children, Families and Learning. $30.5 million over the two-year budgeting period would pay for a program that brings babies and toddlers together with their parents to learn about a child's emotional, physical, mental, and educational devel-opment. The Early Childhood Family Edu- cation (ECFE) program is a 23-year-old program designed for children from birth to kindergarten and their parents. $12 million would pay for after-school enrichment programs. Grants are provided to select neighborhoods so they may offer after-school programs for 9- to 13-year- olds. The amount is $7 million more than the 1996-1997 budgeting period. Theprogram's purpose is to reduce juvenile crime, school suspensions, and increase student achievement. $30.2 million would pay for Head Start, a 31 percent increase from the previous bud-get. Head Start is a federal/state program that provides low income preschool chil- dren with emotional, social, health, nutri- tional, and psychological services.Speech training Minority Leader Steve 11- month-old Megan Danaher Wright, daughterof Jeanne Danaher, executive director of the House Republican Caucus, a lesson in speechmaking April 11 on the House floor.10 SESSION WEEKLY / April 18, 1997 $24.6 million would pay for adult basic education over the biennium. The pro-gram provides educational opportunities for adults with low educational levels. Ser- vices such as literacy training, work force education, and General Educational De- velopment (GED) preparation. $2.3 million would pay for Minnesota food shelves, a 65 percent increase over the pre- vious two-year budget. The increase is in anticipation of an even greater demand on food shelves this spring when many ofMinnesota's poor will see a cut in their federal food stamps. (See April 11, 1997, Session Weekly , page 3.) GAME & FISH GOVERNMENTAssistant anglers allowed Anglers who need help wetting their fish- ing lines due to age, blindness, or disabilityare given a break by a bill ( HF311 ) approved April 14 by the House Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Finance Com- mittee. Seniors and disabled people currently re- ceive free fishing licenses, but those assisting them often must pay for a separate license. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Park), would allow aged and disabled people to be assisted by an unli-censed person as long as only one line is in the water. \"One of my constituents, Mark Jacobson, of Brooklyn Park, brought the problem to my attention,\" Luther said. Jacobson'smother is disabled and needs assistance to pursue her favorite sport. Since she has sev- eral assistants, Jacobson found he would have to pay for a separate fishing license for each assistant. The bill now moves to the house floor. State government funding The House Governmental Operations Committee approved a wide-ranging omni- bus bill April 17 that doles out nearly $632million to fund the state's governmental functions and contains a number of sub- stantial policy revisions. SF1905 , sponsored in the House by com- mittee chair Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls),appropriates funding through the 1998-99 biennium for virtually every aspect of state government activity: the Legislature, courtsand administrative agencies, as well as nu- merous offices, boards, and commissions. Italso funds several new government endeav- ors, including $700,000 to the city of Wabasha to develop the American Bald Eagle Center, and $250,000 to International Falls, Minn., to design an interpretive library and confer-ence center. The omnibus state government finance bill also contains: more than $1 million to remodel the Capi- tol cafeteria; nearly $8 million for public television throughout Minnesota; $300,000 to shore up the struggling Hockey Hall of Fame in Eveleth, Minn.; $20 million to the Minneapolis Employee Retirement Fund; and almost $9 million to fund amateur and youth sports projects. \"This is a good bill,\" said the committee's State Government Finance Division chairRep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) in re- sponse to critics of the version that emerged from his division April 16. \"Everything was done out in the open.\" The full Governmental Operations Com- mittee, though, considered more than a dozen amendments to SF1905 , and ulti- mately removed what some called the bill's most controversial aspect. By a 13-6 vote, the committee deleted the provision allow-ing the state to purchase the Minnesota Twins \u2014 if the team came up for sale \u2014 with $100 million from the budget surplus and the general fund. Still in the bill is language that would raise the state's minimum wage. (Members sent an identical minimum wage proposal (HF1389 ) on to the House Ways and Means Committee for consideration as a separate bill. Effective Sept. 1, 1997, both would forcethe state's large employers to pay workers at least $5.40 per hour. Small employers would have to pay at least $5.15 per hour. The committee also left in place a provi- sion that would repeal the state's price-of-government legislation. The Legislature enacted the price-of-government law, which expresses as a percentage the maximum share of personal income to be collected in taxes and other revenues, in 1995. Lawmakers usethe percentage as a target to assemble the state's budget. \"It's really written very badly,\" Kahn said of the law, \"and the tax committee has said they would take it up. This would make surethey do.\" Other provisions follow.Expanding technology Under SF1905 , authority over the state's technology infrastructure would fall to the Office of Technology, which would be el- evated to the status of a full state agency that answers directly to the governor. The bill defines the nature and extent of the office's responsibilities and would re- quire the office's executive director to coor- dinate all of Minnesota's information and technology systems. The office also would evaluate technology proposals, along withhardware and software purchases, made by other state agencies to ensure a comprehen- sive approach to technology applications. Minnesota's North Star on-line service, with its biennial budget of more than $8million, also would come under the aegis of the technology office. SF1905 would require governmental units considering on-line ini- tiatives to use North Star. The service would have to develop a secure means of conduct-ing government business on-line. North Star also would be charged with the task of creating an information and technol- ogy community resource development pro- gram. Designed to encourage economicdevelopment, the resource program would promote technology applications in health care, education, and commerce. The office also would award grants to increase public/ private technology partnerships around thestate. SF1905 also would appropriate $23 mil- lion through the biennium for the state's Year 2000 project to cope with anticipated computer problems brought on by the ap-proaching end of the millennium. Planning community development Earlier in the session, Rep. Dee Long (DFL- Mpls) and Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud)introduced bills aimed at coordinating Minnesota's burgeoning development ef- forts. Both bills adopt the 10 planning guide- lines issued by the Metropolitan Council and appear in SF1905 . The community planning provisions con- tained in SF1905 would allow municipalities to create joint planning districts that would control development decisions. The Office of Strategic and Long-Range Planning wouldoversee the districts, which would have to agree to submit a comprehensive plan for review. The bill also requires communities to define urban growth areas and details a mediation process designed to mitigate anyconflicts that arise out of development ini- tiatives. The bill also contains a $250,000 appro- priation to establish at least two joint-plan- ning pilot projects.11 April 18, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYUnder SF1905's community-based plan- ning act, communities could receive techni-cal and financial assistance from the strategic planning office in exchange for embracing the agency's procedures. Communities would prepare their development policies, submit them to the strategic planning officefor review, and coordinate their efforts with the surrounding local governments. A local government could not implement a plan until it has been approved by the state office. The community-based planning act also would create a 22-member advisory council to develop the overall framework of the state's development strategy. The advisory council would be required to propose legislation for the 1998 session to place that framework instatute. Buying prescription drugs Another section of the law would direct the commissioner of the Department ofAdministration to establish a contracting alliance that would purchase pharmaceuti- cals in bulk and re-sell them less expensively. The alliance, which could take advantage of volume discounts, would make the drugsavailable at the lower price to pharmacies across the state. Participating pharmacies would be required to pass on to consumers at least 75 percent of the contract price's savings. The bill also prohibits health plans from discriminating against consumers who buy drugs through the program and requires that lower priced generic compounds be made available whenever possible. Public sector pay raises Many of Minnesota's public servants would see fatter paychecks under SF1905 . The bill increases the pay of legislators by 5 percent, effective Jan. 4, 1999. The bump would raise the current salary of $29,658 to $31,140. The salaries of judges go up by 2.5 percent in 1998, again in 1999, and are tied to theaverage general salary adjustment for state employees in 2000 and 2001. SF1905 also would hike the maximum pay of state agency heads, who haven't seen a pay scale increase in nearly a decade. Pro-ponents say top candidates for the jobs are escaping due to insufficient salaries.HIGHER EDUCATION If you have Internet access, visit the Legislature's web page at: http://www.leg.state.mn.usHigher education funding The House passed the omnibus higher education finance bill April 16. The vote was112-20. One of the main thrusts of the bill (HF2136/SF1888* ) is to stem the tide of spiraling college costs to make attendance feasible for more low- and middle-incomestudents. \"This bill makes a commitment . . . toward affordable and accessible higher education,\" said bill sponsor Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL- Winona), who noted postsecondary spend-ing has dipped from 15 percent of the state budget to its current 11 percent over the last decade. As a result, he said, there have been double-digit tuition increases across Minnesota's higher education systems. \"With the commitment that the Minne- sota House of Representatives made to [spending] $70 million dollars over the governor['s recommendations], this bill en- sures that tuition \u2014 if there are increases \u2014will be at or less than the rate of inflation. This is a huge change from what has hap- pened in the past,\" Pelowski said. The final total for bill is $2.3 billion. That includes over $1 billion for Minnesota StateColleges and Universities (MnSCU), $1.1 billion for the University of Minnesota (U of M), and $2.4 million for the Mayo Medical Foundation. Other bill provisions include a $1.6 mil- lion appropriation to establish the Coya Knutson endowed chair in political science at the U of M. Knutson was the first and only woman from Minnesota elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Her career wasderailed after her husband launched a public campaign to persuade her to come home. Several bill supporters said that educa- tional institutions in Minnesota, a state con- sidered an agricultural leader, have fallenbehind in maintaining high-quality agricul- tural programs. The bill seeks to remedy the problem through the broadbased Minne- sota Agriculture Education Leadership Council, which would establish a grant pro-gram to develop agriculture education pro- grams, develop legislative recommendations, coordinate agriculture policy, identify criti- cal needs for educators, and link the agribusiness and the educational sectors. Thework would be coordinated through the pro- posed Minnesota Center for Agriculture Education. Successful floor amendments included oneby Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFLRoseville) that would require colleges and universities withNCAA Division I men's hockey programs to develop women's varsity hockey programs. Rep. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth) suc- cessfully proposed an amendment that en- hances the free-speech rights of studentsagainst institutional policies. Before the final vote on the bill, Rep. Hilda Bettermann (R-Brandon) said. \"This is a good bill. It attempts to make up for a lack of higher education funding in the last fewyears and upholds many of the governor's initiatives.\" Other provisions are detailed below. Helping families save The bill exempts $25,000 in family assets from consideration when a student applies for financial aid. Two more bill initiatives would add another $25,000 exemption and provide other savings boosts. The firm. Gopher State Bonds program, would allow the sale of state general obliga- tion bonds, which are exempt from state and federal taxes, in increments as low as $500. Normally, the bonds are available at $5,000or more. While the bonds would be available for purchase to anyone, several provisions would encourage their purchase for college savings: the $25,000 that would be exempt in deter-mining state grant eligibility, and payroll withholding employees could deduct from the purchase of the bonds. \"Not only will families get a tax break, they get a break in their needs assessment when astudent applies for aid,\" Rep. Lyndon Carlson (DFL-Crystal) has said. Similar programs operate in 24 other states. The Gopher State savings bonds program would apply to all higher education pro-grams. A second program, Edvest, would provide state matching grants of up to 15 percent \u2014 for a maximum benefit of $300 \u2014 of college savings. The interest earned would be taxedat a lower rate that would apply to students when it is used for college costs. The program would encourage matching contributions from individuals, foundations and businesses to provide additional grantsto participating students. Keeping technologically fit The omnibus higher education finance bill includes three technology initiatives: A total of $1 million would be appropri- ated for the Minnesota Career and Educa- tion Planning System, a program to allow K-12 and college students to access career12 SESSION WEEKLY / April 18, 1997 information that would help them devise educational plans. The second, MNLink, which Pelowski called \"the mother of all on-line services for library access,\" would provide Internet link- age among public libraries, school and pri- vate libraries, and U of M and MnSCUlibraries. The higher education institutions would provide staff and technical support. The bill appropriates $12 million for the plan. The bill also appropriates money to de- velop courses that could be delivered through the Virtual University which would be a collaboration between the U of M, MnSCU and private colleges that will enable students to register for classes via the Internet at al-most every college and university in the state. \"This would serve as a gateway leading to all higher education existing in Minnesota,\" Pelowski explained at an earlier meeting. \"It's the first time the three entities haveworked together to enhance higher educa- tion in the state.\" The plan is based on the World Wide Web page currently used by the University of Minnesota. According to information fromJohn Gunyou of the Minnesota Office of Technology, the plan is meant to improve access to course offerings, expand choices in degree programs, allow for the transfer of credits between schools, and increase off-campus learning opportunities. The bill funds research for adding course work to the program. Other provisions: $250,000 each year would fund grants to minority students enrolled in nursing pro- grams and programs to recruit persons of color. $50,000 in non-recurring funds would be marked for the loan repayment assistance program for law school graduates working for economically disadvantaged groups, tribal governments, court systems, public interest organizations, public defense cor-porations, or the state board of public de- fense. $3 million would go to design, construct, and equip a recreation facility at the Min- neapolis campus of the U of M that wouldinclude an ice rink for use by the women's athletic program. The bill allows students to gain work-study credits through work with qualified pri- vate employers. Formerly, only educationalor nonprofit organizations qualified in work-study programs. The bill encourages schools to expand work- study programs by sending higher educa- tion students into public elementary andsecondary schools for activities such as tutoring. Nellie, a trained service dog, rests under the witness table as her owner, Lois Weber, of Mankato, testified April 16 in favor of a bill before the House Health and Human Services Finance Division that would provide funds toorganizations that train or provide service dogs for people with disabilities.HOUSING Service fundsOmnibus housing finance bill A $63 million proposal to fund state hous- ing programs that aid the homeless, the dis- abled, first-time home buyers, and others won approval from the Housing and Hous- ing Finance Division of the House Economic Development and International Trade Com-mittee April 15. The bill would appropriate $36.6 million in fiscal year 1998 and $26.4 in fiscal year 1999 for programs administered by the Min- nesota Housing Finance Agency. The provisions of the omnibus housing finance bill were later combined with the omnibus bill assembled by the committee's Economic Development Finance Division. That bill ( HF2158 ) now moves to the House Ways and Means Committee. Below are some of the bill's key housing sections.Homeless assistance, prevention According to Department of Economic Security figures, the number of people using emergency shelters and transitional housing in the state has tripled over the past 11 years. Of the 4,981 Minnesotans needing services in 1996, 44 percent were children. Any in-crease in homelessness triggered by federal and state welfare reforms going into effect this year could strain an already overbur- dened support system. The bill includes several programs to aid the homeless and prevent homelessness. The largest such appropriation would mark $5.7 million for grants to organizations provid- ing case management to help low-income people with poor rental histories rehabilitatetheir rental records and find housing. Part of the funding would also go to innovative approaches for housing people with poor rental histories. Mental illness can often lead to homelessness. Under the bill, $1.7 million per year would go to rental housing assis- tance for mentally ill persons with housing problems. The Family Homeless Prevention and As- sistance Program would get $2.7 million per year to assist families who are homeless or are at imminent risk of homelessness. This program provides grants and encourages innovative responses to homelessness atcounty, regional, and local levels. Another $583,000 per year would go to the Foreclosure Prevention and Rental As- sistance Program to provide borrower coun- seling and interest-free loans for renters andhomeowners who are facing eviction or fore- closure due to a temporary financial hard- ship. Affordable rental housing The Affordable Rental Investment Fund would get $16.4 million for the biennium to provide no-interest first mortgages or de- ferred loans for low-income rental housing. Households earning 80 percent of the statemedian income and in need of affordable housing are the target of this program. Housing Trust Fund The bill would provide $2.3 million per year for the Housing Trust Fund. The fund makes deferred interest loans for the devel- opment and rehabilitation of low-income rental housing, limited equity cooperatives, and home ownership through communityhousing organizations.13 April 18, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYHUMAN SERVICESIndian housing programs Home ownership and rental opportuni- ties for low- and moderate-income Ameri- can Indians are provided by two programs. The Urban Indian Housing Program would receive $187,000 per year to assist Indians living in urban areas. The Tribal IndianHousing Program would get $1.7 million to help Indians living in Greater Minnesota. Homestead support The Minnesota Urban and Rural Home- steading Program would get $186,000 per year to acquire vacant, condemned, or aban- doned single family homes for rehabilitation and sale. The properties are offered to first- time homeowners on a contract-for-deedbasis. Accessibility Loan Program A program that provides deferred pay- ment loans to low-income homeowners forimprovements directly related to the basic housing needs of physically disabled persons would receive $4.3 million per year. The program is operated by local agencies and is limited to households in which one or morepersons have a long-term disability that sub- stantially affects functioning in the home. Housing demolition A $1 million appropriation requested by House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL- Brooklyn Center) would pay for the acquisi- tion, demolition, and removal of substandard multi-unit rental property. The measure was added to the bill even though some membersquestioned whether it would run counter to existing state housing policy and lead to an actual decrease in available low-income hous- ing. Lead poisoning prevention The bill would establish a state advisory task force on lead hazard reduction. The 15- member task force would study and propose a program to certify residential rental prop-erty as lead-safe (meaning that no lead con- taminants are accessible to children). According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, lead poisoning is the number one environmental threat to America's children.Children are typically exposed to lead in the form of paint chips or dust inside the home. Exposure to even an small amount of lead can have devastating effects on a young child, potentially leading to a slower growth rate,lower intelligence, impaired hearing, behav- ioral disorders, and metabolic problems. The task force would propose essential maintenance practices to ensure that a resi-dence remains lead-safe after certification. The legal rights and liabilities of tenants andlandlords also would be studied in regard to providing lead-safe housing and in cases where a child is lead poisoned. A one-time appropriation of $50,000 would fund the task force's activities. Committee resolution In an unusual move, the committee ap- proved a resolution sponsored by Rep. Carlos Mariani (DFL-St. Paul) protesting the factthat the Housing and Housing Finance Divi- sion was not given an opportunity to review a provision of the state's welfare reform bill (HF159 ) which would reduce benefits to families living in federally subsidized hous-ing by $100 per month. Mariani called this provision, now contained in both the House and Senate welfare proposals, the \"most sig- nificant housing policy and funding deci- sion in the 1997 legislative session.\" The resolution, which was signed by six members of the committee, states that the provision may result in the statewide loss of 1,000 publicly subsidized housing units, sub- stantially reducing access to affordable hous-ing in the state. The resolution calls on House leadership and the House Ways and Means Committee to take measures to offset the negative im- pact of this policy on welfare recipients liv-ing in subsidized housing. Protecting tenants A bill that would prohibit landlords from penalizing tenants for calling 911 for emer-gency help was passed by the House on April 14 on a 132-0 vote. The bill responds to a problem that devel- oped after some cities passed anticrime ordi- nances that penalize landlords whoseproperties are subject to frequent police vis- its. As a result, some landlords began warn- ing tenants against calling police, often with the threat of eviction. Many targets of the warnings have been women who suffer do-mestic abuse. HF686 , sponsored by Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul), says that a landlord may not impose a penalty on a tenant for calling 911 in response to domestic abuse orany other conduct, and that landlords and tenants cannot enter into agreements that would permit the practice. The legislation supersedes local regulations and authorizes the attorney general's office to investigateand prosecute violations. It would slap land- lords with civil penalties for actual damagesor $500, whichever is greater, and would award them to tenants, in addition to anyattorneys' fees incurred to obtain them. The bill states that its provisions do not protect tenants from penalties for lease breaches or disruptive behavior. HF686 now goes to the Senate. Welfare proposal advances Just how much money Minnesota's poor and legal immigrants should receive in their monthly welfare checks is now in the hands of a small panel of lawmakers. A conference committee is meeting to work out the differences between the House andSenate versions of a welfare reform bill ( SF1*/ HF159 ). Both bills use Minnesota dollars to make up for some of the federal cuts to legal immi- grants and require welfare families to workor be penalized. As it stands now, the House would spend about $732.6 million over the 1998-1999 state budgeting period. The Senate, $760 million. Neither version allocates money, however. The omnibus human services spending bill in both the House and Senate is expected to carry the appropriations. Aside from the money differences, there are policy differences as well. The House bill, for instance, discourages welfare moms from having another child while on public assistance. The Senate ver- sion does not. The House bill also requires legal immi- grants to have lived in Minnesota on March 1, 1997, to receive public assistance. The Senate bill does not. Compared to the Senate, the House ver- sion would move people off welfare morequickly by reducing the amount of money they can earn while receiving benefits. The House bill also would more severely punish people on welfare who are not work- ing. The Senate bill would exempt certain people from the federal 5-year lifetime limit on welfare benefits due to advanced age, illness, pregnancy, or family crisis. The House bill does not. Unlike the Senate bill, the House bill au- thorizes a truancy prevention pilot program in two school districts across the state for children who are under age 13, frequently tardy or truant, and whose families are onpublic assistance. While both bills exempt from work the14 SESSION WEEKLY / April 18, 1997 caregiver of a newborn for one year, the House bill only offers the exemption as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The Senate bill sets no limits. Overall, both bills would expand state- wide an experimental welfare-to-work pro- gram operating in a handful of Minnesota counties over the past few years. The Minne- sota Family Investment Program (MFIP) would become permanent in all 87 Minne-sota counties. MFIP allows families to accept lower-pay- ing jobs while receiving some public assis- tance such as extra monthly cash and subsidized child and health care. In theory,allowing someone to work while still receiv- ing benefits helps a low-skilled parent gain work experience and eventually obtain a better job. MFIP statewide would replace the tradi- tional Aid to Families with Dependent Chil- dren program done away with by the 1996 federal welfare law. States across the country are hurrying to pass new welfare laws after the federal gov-ernment scrapped the long-standing welfare system in August 1996. The House passed the bill April 11 by a vote of 118-14. The Senate passed the bill March 20, by a vote of 67-0. (See Jan. 24, 1997, Session Weekly, page 9; Feb. 7, 1997, Session Weekly, page 3 and page 12; March 7, 1997, Session Weekly, page 17; March 21, 1997, Session Weekly, page 15; and March 28, 1997, Session Weekly, page 11)).House research analyst Elisabeth M. Loehrke, right , prepares an amendment for one of the many bills awaiting action by the House Health and Human Services Finance Division April 15. LABORMILITARY Strawberry workers supported The House went on record April 16 in favor of better treatment of California straw- berry workers. A bill ( HF1877/SF1675* ) al- ready approved in the Senate passed the House on a vote of 76-54. It was sponsored by Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls), chair of the House Labor-Management Relations Committee. Strawberry workers, represented by the United Farm Workers Union, are conduct- ing a national campaign to call attention to their plight. The typical strawberry worker earns about $8,500 per season for working asmany as 12 hours a day, stooped over the low berry plants. Despite record production lev- els and sales revenue of $650 million per year in the strawberry industry, most workers have not had a significant raise in 10 years. According to the bill, workers also claim a variety of workplace abuses including: de- mand for sexual favors in exchange for em- ployment; hiring and firing on whim; lack of fresh water and clean toilet facilities; andlack of health care in an occupation that exposes them to hazardous pesticides and chronic back injuries. Strawberry workers who have struggled to change these practices and organize a unionhave faced firing and blacklisting. Workers who have voted for union representation have seen the fields they work plowed under. The House resolution would put the state on record along with a number of otherstates, consumer groups, environmental or- ganizations, churches, labor organizations,and others in support of the strawberry work- ers' cause. The bill now goes to Gov. Arne Carlson. If approved, the secretary of state would be directed to transmit the resolution to Presi- dent Bill Clinton and to the governor of California. Enlist and enroll A bill to increase the amount of individual education grants for Minnesota National Guard members was approved by the House Ways and Means Committee April 14. HF297 would enhance a standing pro- gram that reimburses guard members for their tuition costs. Under the current pro- gram, participants can receive a maximum grant equivalent to up to 75 percent of thecost of lower-division undergraduate tuition in the college of liberal arts at the University of Minnesota (U of M). At one time, the program also covered up to 50 percent of tuition costs for more ex-pensive programs, such as medical school. HF297 would restore the organization's au- thority to pay for some of those programs. It would cover up to 50 percent of actual tu- ition costs for programs at any Minnesotapublic educational institution or a compa- rable program at the U of M, including gradu- ate degree programs approved by the guard. Bill sponsors said the provision is neces- sary to keep the guard attractive to futuremembers of the medical or other professions the guard needs. In the case of medical school, for example, the 50 percent reimbursement rate would be higher than the current maximum grantamount tied to the cost of lower division courses at the U of M. According to bill sponsor Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), the initial change can be made with money currently in theprogram. The organization has discretion over the number of students who are reim- bursed and the educational programs that qualify. Rep. Bruce Anderson (R-Buffalo Town- ship), an Air National Guard member and bill co-sponsor, said the education grant program is an important incentive to attract new members. \"We have an all-voluntary military. This is an attempt to allow peopleto serve and reap a reward for doing so,\" he said. HF297 next will be heard on the House floor. Need a copy of a bill?

The bill recommends $3 billion in statespending for transportation and public safety purposes over the next two years. HF19 , sponsored by Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL-Crookston), now moves to the House Ways and Means Committee. Public safety The bill calls for $111.6 million in spend- ing for the Minnesota State Patrol. Included is $3.5 million to fund an additional 30 statetroopers \u2014 not the full complement re- quested by the governor, but 30 more than the Legislature authorized last year. The gov- ernor refused to enact a speed limit increase called for by lawmakers in 1996 because thetrooper funding was missing. Also included is $2 million for computer- aided dispatching and records management and $1.7 million to install video cameras in state patrol vehicles. Another $69.5 millionwould go to the department's Driver and Vehicle Services Division over the next bien- nium. Also, $2.6 million would go to the Department of Public Safety and the Minne- sota Safety Council for various public safetyprograms. The bill includes $652,000 to provide sur- vivor benefits to the families of state patrol officers who have died or been disabled in the line of duty. Though they are eligible forpensions, many of these officers and their families lost their health care benefits once they could no longer serve as peace officers. An average of three officers per year lose their lives in the line of duty in Minnesota. Road and bridge construction State road construction projects would receive $1.2 billion for the next two years. Local roads would get $841.6 million andlocal bridges $39.8 million in state aid. Transit The Metropolitan Council, which runs the metropolitan area's public transporta-tion system, would receive $130.1 million over the next biennium. Of that money, $34.6 million would go to Metro Mobility, which provides rides to approximately 25,000 metropolitan-area people with disabilities.The bill also authorizes and would fund a $100,000 study of coordinating public tran-sit and school transportation in Minneapo- lis and St. Paul. The Met Council had requested and the governor had recommended $138.1 million for the next biennium in state funds to run its transportation programs. An additional $29.6 million would go to assist transit programs in Greater Minnesota. Aviation The bill appropriates $36.3 million for air transportation programs, including $26 mil-lion for airport development and assistance. Other funds support the Civil Air Patrol and provide general support for aviation in the state. Railroads and waterways A total of $6.9 million would go to fund rail and water transportation. This includes a $1 million study to look at utilizing existing freight railroad corridors for a commuterrail service in the metropolitan area. Young drivers A bill to ensure that 15-year-olds are al- lowed restricted driver's licenses to help out on the family farm was approved April 16 by the House. The vote was 134-0. The bill ( SF475*/HF768 ), sponsored by Rep. Torrey Westrom (R-Elbow Lake),would provide an exception to a new state law requiring anyone under age 18 to hold a Rural rightsNOTES Susan Coultrap McQuin, Ph.D., dean of the College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, andprofessor of women's studies at Mankato State University, testified April 14 before the Economic Development Finance Division in support of a bill that would establish a rural policy and development center designed topromote research relating to issues confronting rural Minnesota.learner's permit for at least six months be- fore becoming eligible for a driver's license. The 1996 Legislature passed the new learner's permit requirements, which took effect Feb. 1, 1997, with hopes that the law would give teen- agers more driving experience before they can hit the road on their own. But the law had an unintended side effect, according to Westrom. It cut in half the time farm families can benefit from a state law allowing 15-year-olds to get restricted driver's licenses allowing them to help withfarm business. Restrictions placed on such licenses allow 15-year-olds whose parents are farmers to drive only during daylight hours and only within 20 miles of the family farm. Westrom's bill would exempt 15-year-olds who are otherwise eligible for a restricted farm driver's license from the new six-month learner's permit requirement. The bill now goes to the governor. Late nights, long hours, and many amendments are just a part of the recipeneeded to craft an omnibus finance bill in time to meet the final committee deadline. During such a stressful time, a sense of hu- mor can fit nicely into the mix as well. Article 8, Section 13, on page 120 of the omnibus state government finance bill (SF1905 ) instructs the Board of Govern- ment Innovation and Cooperation to study the creation of the Tommy Rukavina High Tech Iron Range Info Center. \"Visitors to the center will learn how to find the computer in a room full of office equipment; how to turn the thing on; why it costs so much; what a computer can do that a pencil and a piece of paper can't; and wherethe Internet is,\" the bill says of the institution that would bear the name of Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia), who chairs the committee's State Government Finance Di- vision. Rep. Kevin Knight (R-Bloomington), who wrote the bill's info center language and sits on the finance division, said he and the divi- sion members have heard so much testi- mony on dozens of technology initiativesthis session, many of which prompted Rukavina to proclaim his exasperation with things technological. \"When you think of Rukavina, you think of technology,\" Knight said with a grin. \"It'sabout time that people know that Tommy Rukavina is a high-tech genius.\" The section was later deleted.16 SESSION WEEKLY / April 18, 1997The Encyclopedia Americana is less than kind to Harold Stassen. While rightfully characterizing him as an American po- litical leader, the brief entry also notes, \"He is known chiefly for his persistent and futilepursuit of the office of president of the United States.\" Stassen did seek the Oval Office nine times, coming closest during his first campaign, when, in 1948, he lost the Republican nomi-nation to Thomas Dewey. But his quixotic attempts should not define his place in his- tory. Harold Stassen, who turned 90 on April 13, was a visionary on international issues and a consistent progressive voice in theRepublican party. His long and storied po- litical career, spanning generations and con- tinents, stems from humble beginnings on a West St. Paul farm. Born the third of five children in 1907, Harold Edward Stassen was raised in a strong Baptist family, where dinner table conversa- tion touched on weighty issues with implica- tions far beyond Minnesota's borders. Politics was in Harold's blood. His father,William, served as head of the local school board and as mayor of West St. Paul. An excellent student, Stassen the \"wonder boy\" completed high school at 15, his under- graduate studies at 19, and emerged fromthe University of Minnesota with law degree in hand at age 21. Two years later, in 1930, he would win his first election, and served as Dakota County attorney. After a second term, Stassen prepared for his first statewide elec-tion. The victory, by more than 291,000 votes, would make him, at age 31, the young- est governor in the nation. Candidate Stassen ran a good-government campaign, promising Minnesotans that thepatronage system for state government jobs would end. Upon election, he called the es- tablishment of the civil service system \"one of the first and foremost problems\" facing his administration. \"A place on the state payroll must be based upon doing a good day's work for the people of the state, for a day's pay received . . . There must be no percentage collections by politi- cal bosses,\" he said in his first inauguraladdress. He was true to his word, and later signed landmark legislation which estab- lished the basis for today's state government employment system. While he enjoyed success as a governor, and easily won re-election to the office in both 1940 and 1942, it was on the national Would-be president . . . Gov. Harold Stassen has proud, progressive legacy and international stage where Stassen shined brightest, beginning with his speech before the Republican National Convention in June 1940. In his keynote address, delivered just nine days after the Germans entered Paris, Stassen told delegates that \"once again the black shadow of despotism falls over the world.\"While many in the Republican party banged the drum of isolationism, Stassen said it was \"clear that our interests lie with the encour- agement of freedom and progress for all mankind and the development of orderamong nations . . .\" It is this vision of inter- nationalism that led Franklin D. Roosevelt to send Stassen to San Francisco five years later, where, as one of seven U.S. delegates, he would help draft a charter for the UnitedNations. Stassen had been championing such an organization for years, writing in the Satur- day Evening Post in May 1943 of the \"need to develop a new and higher level of govern-ment to serve mankind.\" He believed \"the nations of the world must not merely agree that they wish to live together in peace; they must establish a mechanism of government to achieve this end.\" On July 2, 1945, theUnited Nations Charter was presented to the U.S. Senate for confirmation. The charter's preamble states the organi- zation exists to \"save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\" Halting the armsrace, reducing and eventually eliminating allweapons of war remain major concerns of the United Nations. These were also major concerns of Stassen's, when in 1954 he as- sumed the position as chief of arms negotia- tions in the Eisenhower administration. Again, his voice of internationalism rose above the fray, which often put him at odds with others in the administration, particu-larly Secretary of State John Foster Dulles, \"who wanted only formal, diplomatic ex- changes\" with post-Stalinist Russia, Stassen said. Stassen wanted the lines wide open. \"I was convinced . . . that if you opened up exchange in the world between the commu- nist areas and the non-communist areas and you got an exchange of people and ideas and information, and you would maintain a veryalert and powerful military position at the same time, and develop trade, that you had a better chance of a gradual modification of the communist system away from absolute dictatorships, and that you had a betterchance of evolution of the world without the tragedy of a nuclear war,\" he told Dr. Tho- mas Soapes, of the Eisenhower Library in 1977. Stassen also was a war hero himself, re- signing as governor in 1943 to join the Navy and its Pacific Fleet. He was in Tokyo Bay in August 1945 to free American prisoners of war. But instead of returning home to Minne-Harold Stassen, three-term Minnesota governor, internationalist, and adviser to presidents, addressed the Minnesota House March 10, 1992, in the midst of his final run for the presidency. His subject: seven mighty moves to make America great. Rep. Dee Long looks on from the speaker's chair. Continued on page 1917 April 18, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYEver since its completion in 1905, the Capitol and its surrounding grounds have been viewed as the perfect setting for memorials to various historic figures and events. In recent years, though, that sentiment has grown, along with the number of monu- ments \u2014 now holding at 15 \u2014 spread over the Capitol mall. In fact, this year the House Governmental Operations Committee'sState Government Finance Division heard funding requests for three additional me- morials to be placed in or around the Capi- tol, causing some critics to wonder if, perhaps, monument mania has gotten out of control. The first monument appeared on the Capi- tol grounds in 1912, when admirers of former Gov. John A. Johnson placed a statue of him near the building's front entrance , according to North Star Statehouse: An Armchair Guide to the Minnesota State Capitol, by Thomas O'Sullivan. The larger-than-life tribute toA Capitol honor . . . Monuments, memorials, guidelines for immortality bus and Leif Erikson, the two men who\"discovered\" America, albeit more than 400 years apart. Over the years, additional monuments were placed on the mall, and lawmakerscreated the Capitol Area Architectural and Planning Commission in 1967 to oversee the process. To the commission, which later became a board, falls the task of maintaining and preserving the Capitol building andgrounds. The board, according to Minne- sota statute, serves as the Capitol area's plan- ning and design review agency. Mary Duroche, a planner with the archi- tectural board, said the agency tries to remaintrue to Capitol architect Cass Gilbert's origi- nal vision for the institution. In 1993, Duroche said, the board adopted a monument plan based on grouping the tributes by theme. Memorials to former governors and otherdistinguished men and women of state, for example, would continue to be placed nearon the surrounding grounds. The board adopted the guidelines in 1993, Duroche said, at the behest of the Legisla- ture, where a growing number of members had become concerned about the prolifera-tion of monuments that had sprouted up on the Capitol grounds. \"Nobody wants to be against these things. But if somebody proposes a monument to Mother Teresa, who could vote against that?\"Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls) told the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1992. The policy describes not only the aesthetic considerations by which a monument's de- sign will be judged, but also the specificcriteria that must be met before an indi- vidual can be memorialized. For example, an individual has to have been dead for at least 10 years, according to the board's policy, before a monument onthe grounds to the person could even be considered, and a minimum of 25 years to be eligible for a commemoration to be placed inside the building. The Capitol, Duroche said, has a finite amount of space in which toplace memorials, including a number of al- coves designed for just that purpose \u2014 hence the restrictions. \"They [the Legislature] decided they bet- ter set up some standards and rules to assurethat there would be some spaces left for others,\" who emerge as significant influ- ences in the future, Duroche said. The Legislature, though, did not place the board's policies in statute. Instead, only adescription of the board's mission and re- sponsibilities received the force of law. The policies remain mere guidelines to be ob- served at the Legislature's discretion, which is why people continue to come before thefinance division to seek funding for more memorials. Some meet the criteria estab- lished by the board. Others don't. \"We don't have the authority to originate these things,\" Duroche said. \"We . . . some grand plan.\" \u2014 F.J. GallagherJohnson features a quartet of workmen whorepresent four of Minnesota's vital indus- tries and is meant to honor both the stalwartlaborers and tremendous natural resources of the state. A second statue, erected in 1928 and hon- oring former Gov. Knute Nelson, flanks the Johnson memorial, while a third Minnesotagovernor, Floyd B. Olson \u2014 the state's first third-party chief executive \u2014 was honored with a monument in 1958. In between, the state also erected permanent memorials on the Capitol grounds to Christopher Colum-the front of the Capitol building itself, while homage to other non-political but no less notable Minnesotans would be placed off tothe west, along John Ireland Boulevard. \"The ones on the Capitol mall are more apt to be devoted to a movement or an event,\" Duroche said of the monuments. \"There haven't been any statues, as such,since the 1985 Lindbergh.\" In addition to the overall design plan, Duroche said, the board also developed a policy for installing new commemorative works, both inside the Capitol building and If you will be visiting the Capitol in the near future, call the Capitol Historic Site Program at (612) 296-2881 to schedule a tour.The Capitol grounds hold 15 monuments and memorials, honoring Christopher Colombus, left, Gov.

The signs com- memorate Pierce Butler Jr., a St. Paul lawyerand civic leader. But without the \"Jr.\" on the signs, they also serve as the most visible reminder in the state of Butler's father, Pierce Sr., who be- came the first Minnesotan to serve on theU.S. Supreme Court. The elder Butler was born in 1866 in Da- kota County, Minnesota, when it was still part of the frontier, and where, according to David Danelski in A Supreme Court Justice is Appointed , \"hostile bands of the Sioux and Ojibway Indians still roamed.\" His parents, Patrick and Mary, were Irish immigrants who came to the area to farm. Butler was the sixth of nine children. Patrick Butler was an educated man and former school teacher, who, according to Danelski, tutored his children in the three R's, as well as in Latin, German, and math- ematics. Later, Pierce Butler enrolled at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn., five miles from the Butler farm. A month aftergraduation, he came to St. Paul where he studied law at the firm of Pinch and Twohy. In 1888, St. Paul attorney Walter H. Sanborn approved Butler's admission to the bar \"af- ter quizzing him in open court, as was thecustom in those days,\" Danelski writes. That same year, Butler cast his vote for Grover Cleveland as president \"and hence- forth was a Democrat.\" While Butler was making a name for him- self in St. Paul, his five brothers were heavily involved in mining in the Mesabi and Cuyuna ranges \"and by 1914 had eighteen mines under contract,\" according to Minnesota: A History of the State by Theodore C. Blegen. \"In later years . . . they employed a thousand or more men. Contractors, builders, and engineers, they created a Minnesota firm that has left its mark not only on the iron-ore industry but also on vast building opera-tions, including Minnesota's State Capitol.\" By 1894, Butler was cited in the Minnesota Law Journal as \"one of the best in the history of Ramsey County.\" The magazine said \"he has no equal for his age as a criminal lawyerin the state,\" and \"he has a charming and agreeable manner, is an eloquent speaker,Early statesman . . . Pierce Butler: first Minnesotan on nation's high court and his integrity, ability, and fearlessness . . .made him what he is today.\" From 1893 to 1897, Butler served as Ramsey County attor-ney, his only elective post. Soon after beginning his law practice, But- ler gained detractors but more admirers, for his fierce reputation in the courtroom, which, by some accounts, was extreme. \"Anothercritic called Butler 'a veritable bully, aggres- sive to the point of being insulting,' who treated 'witnesses with a ruthlessness sel- dom seen in court,'\" Danelski writes. Years later, one man, William A. Schaper, head of the Department of Political Scienceat the University of Minnesota, would come to know Butler's ruthless side. Butler, who served on the university's board of regents from 1907 to 1924, led the board in what would become a permanent stain on itsrecord by almost destroying Schaper's ca- reer and reputation in the course of a day. In 1917, the board received a letter from a member of the Public Safety Commission that included Schaper's name on a list ofprofessors \"whose loyalty was suspect.\" The regents immediately requested a meeting with Schaper. \"He was rigorously cross-ex-amined by Butler on his views concerning the war,\" Danelski writes. The cross-exami- nation included accusations and innuendo that Schaper was a patriot only to the extent that would keep him out of jail; that he wasa lackey for the German Kaiser, whom he wanted to dominate the world; that, as a University employee, he lived off public money; and was a draft dodger, even though he was past draft age. Schaper told the board that he considered it his duty to \"abide by the law and not hinder in any manner the government's conduct of the war.\" He had encouraged students to enlist. He had advised them against peace activities. Hewould not, however, as an avowed pacifist, \"boost\" for the war, he said. The same day, the board of regents in- formed Schaper that it had voted unani- mously that he should resign on the groundsthat he was a disloyal American citizen, per- manently ending his career at the university, Danelski writes. For years to come, Schaper struggled fi- nancially and fought to have his name and his position restored. But it took almost two decades before the board of regents wouldvote to make Schaper a professor emeritus and pay him $5,000 in compensation. The Legislature had begun to investigate the ear- lier board's actions. By that time Schaper had found work as a professor of finance at the University of Oklahoma. Still, the incident didn't seem to have im- plicated Butler directly as it did the board of regents, except, perhaps, in Schaper's mind. He later would fight vigorously against Butler's nomination to the high court. Years before the Schaper incident, how- ever, and after his term as Ramsey County attorney, Butler's career went into higher gear as a corporate attorney. He had already successfully represented the federal govern-ment in an important case against Midwest millers for selling tainted flour, and in a case Pierce Butler, the first Minnesotan to win appointment to the nation's highest court. Photo courtesy Legislative Manual 1973-1974 \"He has no equal for his age as a criminal lawyer in the state, . . . he has a charming and agreeable manner, is an eloquent speaker, and his integrity, ability, and fearlessness . . . made him what he is today.\" \u2014Minnesota Law Journal, 189419 April 18, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYagainst midwest meat packers for violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act. In 1915, the Canadian government en- listed his aid in effort to take over the Grand Trunk Railroad. \"One of the arbitrators in the Grand Trunk arbitration was former president William Howard Taft,\" Danelskiwrites. \"For several weeks Taft watched Butler in action and was impressed by what he saw; the St. Paul lawyer more than held his own with the best barristers in Canada. The two Americans soon became friends . . . .When, near the end of the arbitration, Taft received word that he had been nominated Chief Justice of the United States, he and Butler celebrated the occasion.\" Taft would later play a major role in Butler's passage tothe U.S. Supreme Court. Danelski writes of the tortuous process by which Butler was ultimately appointed to the high court, in which many other candi-dates and groups with varied interests lob- bied for influence. He was ultimately nomi-nated by President Warren G. Harding, a Republican. The U.S. Senate confirmed the nomination in a 61-8 vote, with 27 absten- tions. On Jan. 2, 1923, Butler was sworn in as associate justice. His tenure on the court confirmed some fears about him and dispelled others. Con- trary to his behavior in the Schaper incident, he proved a champion of due process. But, Danelski writes, \"in cases involving substan-tive issues of freedom, however, was a curi- ous reversal of his due-process record.\" He voted for the individual only 29 percent of the time, compared with the court's average of 50 percent. In cases regarding govern-ment and the economy, he was a conserva- tive and was in the majority in a 5-4 decision that invalidated New York's minimum wage law for women. Further, \"the progressives'expectation that Butler would side with the . was also correct,\" Danelski says.Finally, \"Butler's activity in economic cases was consistent with his value of laissez faire\" government. Butler died on Nov. 16, 1939, while still serving on the court. He had raised eightchildren with his wife, Annie M. Cronin. In 1961, the St. Paul City Council changed the name of the Northern Route to the Pierce Butler Route, in honor of a son, born in 1893, who would follow in his father's foot-steps as a public servant. Since Butler's term, two more Minneso- tans have served on the U.S. Supreme Court. Warren Burger, of St. Paul, served from 1969- 1986, and was named chief justice. HarryBlackmun, who was raised in Rochester, has been serving on the court since 1970. \u2014 Celeste Riley Committee deadlines Each year the House and Senate set deadlines by which most bills must be heard in a committee and forwarded through the process. The deadlines serveto weed out some of the several thousand bills introduced each year. The third and final deadline has come and gone. By Friday, April 18 , all appropriations bills must have cleared their policy and finance committees and moved to eitherthe Taxes Committee or Ways and Means Committee. Of course, there are exceptions to the deadlines. Any lawmaker may try to convince the Rules and LegislativeAdministration Committee, which in- cludes leaders from both party cau- cuses, to hear a bill after the deadline. While some committees will continue to meet, much of the legisla-tive action now moves from the hearing rooms to the House floor. When lawmakers convened Jan. 7,floor sessions were held twice weekly. The week of April 14-18 was the first this year in which floor sessions were held each day. The pace is expected to quicken. The daily sessions will continueto lengthen. The only remaining deadline date is now Monday, May 19 , the anticipated date for adjournment. The Minnesota Constitution prohibits the Legislaturefrom meeting after the first Monday following the third Saturday in May. This year, that date is May 19.sota to continue his political career, where many say he could have handily won a U.S.Senate seat in a 1948 match against Minne- apolis Mayor Hubert Humphrey, Stassen aimed higher. He wanted to be president. In the race against New York Gov. Tho- mas Dewey to carry the party banner, Stassenheld his own in a series of presidential pri- maries, until the Oregon contest in May 1948. Beginning May 1, Dewey launched a three- week offensive designed to weaken Stassen.In response, Stassen delivered a strong anti- Communist speech on May 12 in Portland, in which he said \"for the best hope of a future of peace and freedom . . . Communist orga- nizations should in all freedom-loving coun- tries.\" Dewey held the opposite position. Many say it was their nationwide radio debate \u2014 the first of its kind, marking the birth of modern-day, face-to-face presiden-tial debates \u2014 that marked the turning point in the contest. Newspapers and pundits gave Dewey the edge. Three days later, Stassenlost the Oregon primary \u2014 his first electoral defeat. He would come no closer to winning the U.S. presidency. Instead, he turned to academic life, ac- cepting the role of president of the Univer-sity of Pennsylvania, where he served until 1953. After joining the Eisenhower adminis- tration, Stassen served as director of the Mutual Security Agency, director of the For- eign Operations Administration, and assis-tant to the president on disarmament. Stassen would unsuccessfully seek a num- ber of local, state, and federal elective offices over the succeeding three decades. His run for the presidency in 1992, which broughthim to Minnesota's House chamber to ad- dress state lawmakers, was his last. Newspaper accounts of his many cam- paign efforts all hold similar quotes. \"I have become increasingly concernedthat none of the candidates in my view have been discussing and coming up with solu- tions for the real issues before the country,\"he told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 1987. While many, from Johnny Carson to edi- torial writers throughout Minnesota and else- where, have pilloried Stassen for chasing the White House, no one can criticize him forlacking ideas. Those ideas, particularly his progressive views of American foreign policy in an era of cold war protectionism, helped forge the creation of the United Nations, as well asopen lines of communication with post- Stalinist Russia. \"He runs,\" Stassen's wife, Esther, told the Minneapolis Tribune in 1978, \"because he isn't happy unless he's speaking out, gettinghis ideas across. He's happy doing it. That's what counts.\" \u2014 John TschidaContinued from page 1620 SESSION WEEKLY / April 18, 1997HF Vetoed Signed Description SFBills await governor's actionTracking the Bills . . . 6 - April 17, 1997 Res. 1 538* 1239 Resolution to mitigate economic competition among states. 4/16/97 1 1* 3 Education caps removal. 2/14/972 13* 17 Revisor's bill. 2/19/973 121* 109 Youth initiative neighborhood addition provided. 2/25/974 343 264* Housing Finance Agency; providing temporary approval for home improvement loans. 2/25/975 631* 508 Hopkins performing arts center modified. 3/5/976 125* 160 Kenyon tax levy recertification authorized. 3/11/977 bill. 3/11/978 374 202* Property disposition modification. 3/13/9710 431 315* Business corporations and limited liability companies technical modifications. 3/18/9711 441* 299 Uniform commercial code changes. 3/18/9712 100* 114 Emergency snow removal. 3/19/9713 40 129* Minnesota ID cards for minors. 3/19/97 Once a bill has passed both the House and the Senate in identical form, it's ready to be sent to the governor for consider- ation. The governor has several optionswhen considering a bill. The governor can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which results in the bill be- coming law in the first year of the bien- nium. The timing of these actions is as significant as the actions themselves. In the first year of the biennium, theimportant thing to remember is that the governor has three days from the time of \"presentment\" to veto a bill. If the governor doesn't sign the bill within this time frame, it will become law with or without his signa-ture. (Sundays are not counted in the three- day time limit, but holidays are.) Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority. This option allows the governor to eliminatethe appropriation items to which he objects. As with all vetoes, the governor must include a statement listing the reasons for the veto with the returned bill. Here, too, the time- table is within three days after the governorreceives the bill. A two-thirds vote of the members in eachhouse is needed to override a veto. But be- cause only the governor can call a special session of the Legislature, anything vetoed after the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 at least until the next year. The governor's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota Constitution (Article IV, Section 23).

From the majestic St. Croix and mighty Mississippi rivers on the eastboundary to the roaring Red River on the west, waterways have been instrumental informulating the shape of things to come in the state. Before 1849, when Minnesota became a territory, and thereafter, the rivers have been used for logging, shipping, milling flour, travel, and recreation. The geographicboundaries of the east, west, and part of the north were determined by using rivers andlakes as borders. The shape of the eastern border seems to depict, with a bit ofimagination, a profile of George Washington, \"The Father of Our Country,\" facingwest and conceptually overseeing the future of the land west of the Mississippi and thefate of its people. Rivers then, as now, are not the only entities that gave shape to the state. The people have been the most important contributors to its future. In true pioneering spirit, agovernment was established to oversee the preservation of the territory and the rightsand privileges of its citizens, present and future. However, in early stages of statehood,Minnesotans were often at odds with each other. In 1857, for example, north-south border proponents disagreed with the eastwest- faction over what the state's boundaries should be. The east-west group wanted theCapitol built in St. Peter with the northern boundary of the state drawn just north ofSt. Paul. Other disagreements arose at the constitutional convention over who wouldwrite the state's constitution, Democrats or Republicans. While the two partiesrefused to sit in the same room or to sign each other's documents, the legislativeassembly solved the problem by adopting both. Fortunately, in times of struggle, Minnesotans come together in support of a common cause. Not long after becoming a state, volunteers from the 1st MinnesotaRegiment, for example, joined with the Union Army to fight in the Civil War. Today,while the Legislature is busy completing its work for 1997, a different kind of war isbeing waged along the Red River border where thousands have been affected by majorfloods. The Capitol is located some 235 miles to the east of the Red River, and legislators and staff cannot physically go to help their fellow Minnesotans in need just yet. Butthey, like other citizens around the state, are volunteering and gathering goods andfinancial donations. This is just an initial offering of help. There is already talk of aspecial session to discuss funding and relief for the western and eastern borders andsome central locations devastated by the flood of 1997. \u2014 LeClair G. Lambert3 April 25, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . April 18 - 24, 1997 Highlights \u2014Photo illustration by Tom OlmscheidFulfilling a pledge made by nearly every legislator during the campaign season,the House Taxes Committee approved a bill April 22 that would dramatically alterMinnesota's property tax, education financeand local government aid systems. \"This is a bill that goes a long way toward property tax reform, while at the same timeproviding immediate relief to taxpayers,\"committee chair Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls)said of the measure, which was approved ona 19-6 vote. The House Ways and Means Committee approved the proposal April 24. The bill goesnow to the House floor. HF2163 not only reduces the tax rates for many of the state's property tax classifica-tions, it compresses the system itself, spread-ing the levies more evenly between classes.The omnibus legislation also modifies thestate's sales and income tax codes, and im-poses new restrictions on the budget surplusand Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts.Moreover, the bill would amend dozens ofother tax-related provisions, such as extend-ing the date by which counties can issuecapital improvement bonds, and applyingthe property tax to all but the smallest windenergy power generators. To fund the reform package, HF2163 draws on a newly created property tax re-form account, which, in turn, would drawfunds from Minnesota's budget surplus. Asummary prepared by the House FiscalAnalysis Department estimates that in 1997,the surplus account has a balance of $487million available to begin implementing thechanges. The House committee passed its tax bill less than a week after the Senate Committeeon Taxes approved their version, SF493 . Al- though the two measures contain many simi-larities, there are a few distinct differences. For example, SF493 would impose a new business tax, known as the business activitiestax (BAT), which would apply not only to afirm's profits, but to wages, benefits, andinterest paid out as well. The idea behind thetax, supporters say, is to more effectivelycapture revenue from those firms that suc-Omnibus tax bill . . . Property tax, education finance systems overhauled cessfully shelter their profits or from compa-nies that do business in Minnesota but don'thave an established corporate presence inthe state. The Senate plan would establish a0.45 percent BAT, and reduce the rates atwhich businesses pay property taxes. HF2163 , on the other hand, provides an appropriation to study the feasibility of add-ing a BAT. The House tax bill also would refund to Minnesota taxpayers 8.5 percent of their1997 property tax burden. For renters, therebate would equal that portion of rent thatwent toward property taxes, assumed to be17 percent of the amount paid in 1997, and20 percent thereafter. Under SF493 , spon- sored by Sen. Doug Johnson (DFL-Cook),renters would get back 20 percent of theirrent. Neither bill contains the education tax credits favored by Gov. Arne Carlson.Carlson's property tax plan featured an edu-cation homestead credit equal to 50 percentof the state's General Education Levy. \"Senate and House members have been working together closely on property taxreform and that's paved the way,\" Long said.\"The differences are contentious, but not problematic.\" Property tax reform The House bill incorporates two separate phases with regard to reforming the system:the first, effective with property taxes pay-able in 1998; the second, for taxes payable in2000. The first phase provides a number of rate reductions and modifies many of the subdi-visions that exist within property classifica-tions. For example, the values included inthe first tier of residential homesteads andcabins would expand from $72,000 to$80,000, while the identical tier in commer-cial/industrial property would rise from$100,000 to $150,000. In addition, the first and upper tiers in the commercial classification would enjoy ratereductions \u2014 from 3 percent to 2.8 percentfor the lowest strata, and from 4.6 percent to4.3 percent for the upper division. Market-rate apartments also would receive a ratereduction. Low-income rental properties, currently taxed as much as 2.3 percent, would be taxedThe House omnibus tax bill not only reduces the tax rates for many of the state's property tax classifications,it compresses the system itself, spreading the levies more evenly between classes. The legislation alsomodifies the state's sales and income tax codes, and imposes new restrictions on the budget surplus andTax Increment Financing districts.4 SESSION WEEKLY / April 25, 1997at 1. 5 percent under the bill. In exchange, though, they become subject to new rules.To qualify for the new, reduced rates, a prop-erty must be occupied by low-income ten-ants and have had a rent restriction agreementwith the Minnesota Housing Finance Agencyin place for at least five years. The propertiesalso must meet minimum housing standardsand be inspected regularly by the agency. Beginning in the year 2000, HF2163 would forsake the 1998 modifications in favor of anentirely new model that relies on only fourclassifications. The four classifications \u2014residential, agricultural, commercial/indus-trial, and apartment \u2014 would be subject totwo separate taxes, a local property tax and astate general education levy, both with auniform rate structure. The property tax refund program would also see major changes under the Housebill's year 2000 provisions. Homeowners withincomes below $100,000 would receive astandard refund of 0.25 percent of theirhome's market value \u2014 to a maximum of$180 \u2014 and an income-sensitive refund tiedto the amount of property tax paid. A total of$750 could be refunded under the law. Aid to local governments With the reclassification in 2000 also would come substantial changes to the manner inwhich the state provides aid to local govern-ments. Under the House plan, the Homestead and Agricultural Credit Aid (HACA) pro-gram would be eliminated, and a new countyLocal Government Aid (LGA) program es-tablished. The existing LGA plans for citiesand towns would be modified so all local aid would be administered on a needs basis,determined by a formula that takes intoaccount a municipality's population, incomelevel, geographic size and net tax capacity. The LGA calculation also would consider an area's sprawl population, defined as allthe people in cities or towns that are closer toa given city with 5,000 or more than anyother city. Sprawl population is defined onlyfor non-metro cities with 5,000 or moreresidents. Cities that contain a significant amount of state-owned properties would receive pay-ments in lieu of property taxes. The pay-ments, 25 cents per square foot foreducational and correctional facilities and75 cents per square foot for all others, wouldbe limited to no more than $15 per capita. Education finance changes Under HF2163 , the manner in which the state finances education would see signifi-cant changes designed to reduce the relianceon property taxes. The bill would reduce the state's general education levy by $210 million for taxespayable in 1998 and $250 million for 1999.In addition, a number of the existing leviesand entitlements, such as the alternative fa-cilities levy and early childhood family edu-cation aid, would be converted to state aids. The levy reductions also would be con- verted, in amounts equal to the decreases, tostate aids. To cover the cost of the educationlevy reductions, HF2163 would draw on funds from the property tax reform accountand the general fund. HF2163 also would prohibit school dis- tricts from conducting levy referendumsbefore Jan. 1, 1998, unless approved by the commissioner of the Department of Chil-dren, Families and Learning. Moreover, thecommissioner could authorize an aggregatetotal of only $16.5 million in additional ref-erenda. By 2000, all additional school district lev- ies would be prohibited, and replaced withstate aids. Moreover, the bill would equalizeschool district referenda. That is, any pro-posed referendum would be levied againstthe district's local tax capacity. Any school district levies enacted after Jan. 1, 1997, would automatically expire andbecome state aid entitlements after fiscalyear 2000. The changes would effectively increase the state's share of education spending to ap-proximately 60 percent of the total. Local levy limits In crafting the bill, several legislators ex- pressed concern that some communities \u2014particularly those worried about seeing adecrease in education funding \u2014 might sim-ply increase their local levies. As a result,HF2163 would establish levy limits for local governments, effective for taxes payable in1998, 1999, and 2000. The bill uses the taxes levied in 1997 as a base for a community's limit, with adjust-ments allowed for inflation and populationgrowth. The specific amounts would be cal-culated by the commissioner of revenue,who would notify the community of theirlimit by Aug. 1. Local governments could exceed the levy limit with voter approval in either a generalor special election. Special levies could beimposed for debt, increased costs due towelfare reform or the 1997 floods. A com-munity also could authorize a special levy ifit was done by referendum and spread evenlyover market values. HF2163 also would allow a community of 1,000 or more that enacts an increase over itsspecified levy limit to hold a reverse referen-dum. If 5 percent of the voters sign a petition calling for the referendum within 21 days ofthe increase's adoption, voters would haveto approve the action in a special electionheld the third Tuesday in January. HF2163 also would modify property tax notices to shift the focus to local governmentspending. Each local government would haveto publicize not only the time and date ofhearings, but also the budget and spendingamounts under consideration. The bill alsoallows for cities and counties to hold jointpublic hearings. Lobbyists, state agency staff, University of Minnesota students, and members of the Willmar High SchoolStudent Council listened as the House Taxes Committee put the final touches on the omnibus tax billApril 21.5 April 25, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYSales tax modifications HF2163 also contains provisions, many of which emerged as recommendations fromthe report of the Sales Tax Advisory Council,designed to more efficiently administerMinnesota's sales and use taxes. The bill would allow several new exemp- tions from the state's sales tax, includingreplacement capital equipment. The salestax on new farm equipment also would bephased out, while used farm equipmentwould be permanently exempted. Other products, which are currently ex- empt, would become subject to the tax. Mostfood and drinks prepared for immediateconsumption would be taxable regardless ofwhether they are heated or not. Telephonecalling cards also would become taxed. Emerging technology, such as the Inter- net, has created new ways for consumers tomake purchases, many of which are beyondthe reach of existing sales tax law. HF2163 would create an advisory council to studythe changes and suggest methods of broad-ening the sales tax base to capture the lostrevenue. The council would report back tothe 1998 Legislature with its findings. Tax Increment Financing Many communities have come to rely on TIF districts to create economic develop-ment. Using TIF, a local government createsa specific district in which property tax val-ues are frozen. As a developer proceeds witha project, the increase in property value overthe frozen amount, known as the increment,is diverted from the normal revenue stream(education finance, local services, etc.) tofinance the economic development. A recent report by the Office of the Legis- lative Auditor determined that, in manycases, communities have incorrectly appliedthe state's existing TIF dollars. As a result,HF2163 contains new provisions designed to crack down on the abuses of TIF through-out the state. Under HF2163 , communities would have to apply a but-for test to additional spendingin existing TIF districts. That is, but for TIF,the development would not occur. Anymoney left unspent when a district expiredwould have to be returned to the local taxjurisdiction. In addition, the bill imposes a number of restrictions on the uses to which TIF moneycan be put, and adopts explicit definitionsaimed at tightening the use of TIF districtcreation.Mandates on local governments HF2163 also regulates the imposition of state mandates on local governments. Thebill creates a division of state and local man-dates within the Department of Finance, andrequires the division to prepare fiscal notesexplaining the costs to local governmentsimposed by any proposed mandate. Thenotes must accompany any bill that wouldimpose a new mandate. This provision would require detailed ex- planations of how and why a mandate wasbeing imposed. Other provisions The House bill also contains a number of miscellaneous measures, many of whichwould allow specific local governments toenact particular taxes within their jurisdic-tions. Hennepin County, for example, wouldimpose a deed and mortgage tax, as wouldRamsey County, and cigarette retailers couldpass on manufacturers' discounts as lowerprices under the Unfair Cigarette Sales Tax. \u2014 F.J. Gallagher CHILDRENCRIME Adoptions and race The House unanimously passed a bill April 18 that would significantly reduce the rolerace plays in placing children for adoptionand in foster care. The vote was 127-0. \"The federal government said that [place- ment considerations] must be in the bestinterests of the child, and that there shouldbe no delays,\" bill sponsor Rep. BarbVickerman (R-Redwood Falls) said. The bill says that placement of a child in foster care could not be delayed or deniedbecause of the race, color, or national originof the child or potential parents. (It wouldnot alter federal law regarding the placementof Indian children.) HF209 also would delete current law that says a child's best interests are met by givingconsideration to race or ethnic heritage whenmaking foster care or adoption placements.Instead, the bill would require \"an individu-alized determination of the needs of thechild\" to be conducted, detailing \"how theselected placement will serve\" those needs. Factors that could be considered include the child's functioning and behavior; medi-cal, educational, and developmental needs;past experience; religious and cultural needs;connection with a community, school, andchurch; interests and talents; relationship tocurrent caretakers, parents, siblings, and rela- tives; and reasonable preferences of the child,if of an appropriate age. The emphasis on race or ethnic heritage in child placements has become controversialin recent years. Critics have said that a short-age of minority foster and adoptive familieshas caused children to languish needlesslywhile interested families were disqualifiedon racial grounds, and that race is not im-portant in family bonding. In 1994, Congress passed the Multiethnic Placement Act, provisions of which are in-corporated into HF209 . Failure to comply with the act could result in federal violationsand reduced federal funding \"The bill tries to get children placed as quickly as possible in a loving environment,\"said Rep. Barbara Sykora (R-Excelsior). \"Tokeep them waiting allows problems to de-velop that never would have happened.\" The bill now moves to the Senate.(See April 11, 1997, Session Weekly, page 4.) Omnibus crime bill Crime and justice in Minnesota would cost the state almost a billion dollars over thenext two years, under a bill moving throughthe House. HF163/SF1880* sailed through the House Ways and Means Committee April 23, itslast step before reaching the House floor. The $990 million bill funds the state's court and correctional systems; law enforce-ment and public safety agencies; and depart-ments such as the office of the AttorneyGeneral and the Human Rights Division. Under the bill, judges would see a raise, work loads for probation officers would bereduced, judicial districts would set up drugcourts, women leaving prostitution wouldfind help, and money would travel to com-munity advocacy groups to help batteredwomen. The Department of Corrections (DOC) would be expected to reduce the daily (perdiem) cost of housing prisoners, makinglayoffs possible. Low income families would have easier access to legal representation in court, aswould low-income farmers. Courts wouldbe given money to launch a pilot program toimprove the resolution of family matters.The program would assign one judge to heardomestic abuse, probate, juvenile and delin-quency matters within a single family.6 SESSION WEEKLY / April 25, 1997County attorneys, public defenders, vic- tim advocates, and shelter personnel wouldbe trained in how to help victims of crimesthat involve possible exposure to HIV. The public safety appropriation includes funds to provide the Bureau of CriminalApprehension (BCA) with an additional fo-rensic scientist to process arson evidencesamples, and to provide laboratory equip-ment and training. The BCA also wouldreceive funds for a polygraph specialist and adatabase on gang activities and member char-acteristics. Also part of the public safety appropria- tions is $1 million in each of the next twostate budget years to pay the overtime neces-sary to police high crime areas. The bill sets aside $320,000 from a DOC's existing pot of money (earned from housingcertain federal inmates) to construct a newbuilding for the wilderness endeavors pro-gram for juvenile offenders at ThistledewCamp in northern Minnesota. Another$300,000 would be used to establish a week-end program at Camp Ripley, near LittleFalls, Minn., for first- or second-time maleoffenders ages 11 to 14. \"The camp shall be ahighly structured program and teach workskills, such as responsibility, organization,time management, and follow-through,\" thebill states. Later, the juveniles would be ex-pected to develop a community services planthat they would fulfill upon release. The DOC appropriations also would cover a restorative justice program in which theaccused would meet with the victim andothers such as family members and law en-forcement personnel. The groups would dis-cuss the impact of the crime; assign a sanctionto the offender; and, if the offender is fromthe community, provide methods for reinte-gration. The bill appropriates $175,000 eachyear for the restorative justice program. The DOC would be required to look into a victim notification system that would keepvictims informed of an inmate's current sta-tus and location, and report back by Febru-ary 1998. Below are some highlights of HF163/ SF1880* in more detail. Gang strike force A major initiative in this year's crime pre- vention bill is to establish a gang task forceand oversight council. The strike force wouldlook at gang problems throughout the state,and be overseen by the council, which wouldbe made up of top law enforcement officialsfrom across the state. In addition to settingup the strike force, the council would de-velop a plan to investigate and prosecutecrimes committed by gangs. The strike force would assist and train local governmentsand law enforcement agencies to identifygang members and to prosecute their crimes.Its members would have jurisdictionthroughout the state to conduct investiga-tions and make arrests. Gang crime is not only exploding within the Twin Cities metropolitan area, but isincreasingly felt in smaller towns and ruralcommunities throughout Minnesota, ac-cording to Hennepin County Sheriff PatMcGowan. A coordinated effort is neededbecause gang and criminal activity do nothonor boundaries, he added. The bill appro-priates $2.1 million each year for the nexttwo years to fund the council and strikeforce, and allows up to 10 additional specialagents to be hired. A second tool to fight gangs would be a gang intervention pilot grant program, inwhich the DOC, through local agencies,would provide services to gang memberswho want to leave their gang. To qualify forhelp, a gang member must be under 25 yearsold and not currently serving time. Theymust not have received similar servicesthrough other programs, and they must com-ply with the program requirements and beemployable. The DOC would report back to the Legis- lature on the program's success by January1999. Arson strike force The bill would set up an arson-fighting strike force that would provide expert inves-tigative and prosecutorial assistance to localagencies in complex and serious cases ofarson. The strike force would consist of rep-resentatives from the fire marshal's depart-ment, the BCA, the attorney general's office,police and fire department officials, thecounty attorney's association, private detec-tives, and other experts. The law responds toan epidemic of arson fires throughout thestate, especially fires related to gang vio-lence. In addition to battling fires, the strike force would help train public safety person-nel and set up educational programs forthem and for prosecutors. Related provisions in the bill would estab- lish a statewide juvenile fire starter interven-tion network, and make clear that refusal totestify or produce evidence in an arson casecan be punished through district courts.Further, a person who commits arson in aneffort to conceal another crime could notonly be convicted of both crimes but sen-tenced for both.Juvenile crime Closely associated with efforts to combat gang problems are initiatives to address prob-lems among juveniles, the focus of manycommittee hearings. The bill includes at leastfive measures to prevent juvenile crime. Community service grant pilot project. Children under age 16 in high crime neigh- borhoods in Ramsey and Hennepin coun-ties would be recruited to perform voluntarycommunity service. The project would pro-vide funding to community-based organi-zations to administer the project. The goal isto encourage good citizenship and discour-age illegal activity among participants. Theprograms could offer children scholarships,gift certificates, tickets for entertainment orgroup outings, or other nonmonetary re-wards. The bill stipulates that participating com- munity agencies must be closely connectedwith the community and local governmen-tal units, represent a diverse population, havea demonstrated ability to successfully coor-dinate the program and to interact with ju-veniles, and have a successful history workingwith schools and parents of juveniles. Enhanced probation pilot project; Ramsey County This program would provide intensive monitoring and coordination between juve-nile probation officers, local law enforce-ment personnel, and culturally specificcommunity nonprofit agencies. The focus ofthe effort would be juveniles on probationwho are considered at risk for committingviolent crimes and are associated with gangand drug activities in Ramsey County. The goal is to discourage young people from criminal activity by providing inten-sive intervention by the involved commu-nity and law enforcement groups. The countymust provide a status report to the Legisla-ture by March each year. Pilot for school-based probation in Anoka and Dakota counties Established by the DOC, the program would select one middle or junior high schooland one senior high school in each countyfor an experiment in placing probation of-ficers within schools to help address behav-ioral incidents by students on probation.The officers would work with school person-nel, families, and other agencies to coordi-nate responses to behavioral problems. Areport on the project's effectiveness wouldbe due to the Legislature by January, 1999.7 April 25, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYPilot for juvenile gun offenders in Hennepin County Juveniles in Hennepin County who are caught illegally possessing a pistol would becommitted to a local county correctionalfacility for not less than 30 days. Twenty-three of those days could be stayed (post-poned), however, if the juvenile successfullycompletes a 40-hour course on gun educa-tion after seven days. The county wouldreport on the project's effectiveness byJanuary 1999. Restitution A working group would be created to study ways in which repeat juvenile offenders couldprovide restitution to their victims. Thegroup would look at having the offender paytheir job wages to the victim. Community social services Currently, community social services al- ready help families with children under 18and who are experiencing special problems,wards of the state, vulnerable adults, peopleover 60 having trouble living independently,people who are mentally retarded, drug ad-dicts, and others. The omnibus bill addsadolescents to the list of those eligible forcertain benefits provided by county boards. Adoption, foster care, placement Many laws governing adoption and foster care placement would be altered under thebill. Residential placements Responsible placement agencies would have better access to records including educa-tional, psychological, psychiatric, and so-cial or family history data. A parent or parents considering relinquish- ing a child to a residential facility would benotified that they have the right to legalcounsel and the right to change their minds.They also would be notified that evidencegathered at the time of placement may beused later as a basis for continued place-ment or termination of parental rights,and, in the event the child is deemed inneed of protection, that the parent andchild each are entitled to legal counsel atpublic expense. Relatives of children placed in residential facilities would be notified if permanentremoval from the home is imminent andgiven an opportunity to be considered as aplacement option. Adoptions and permanent placements Courts could halt efforts to unite a child in need of protection or services with his orher family if such efforts are deemed futilefor reasons such as a parent's history of abuse of the child or other children. Relatives of an adopted child with whom the child previously lived would be able toenter into legally binding agreements withadoptive parents to maintain contact andcommunication. Mental illness and deficiency would be added to the list of characteristics thatwould classify a child as being in need ofprotective services and, therefore, a candi-date for placement. The classificationwould apply to children found not guiltyin connection with a delinquency proceed-ing, extended jurisdiction juvenile pros-ecution, or a proceeding involving a pettyoffense. Attorneys would be prohibited from simul- taneously serving as a child's guardian adlitem and requires that a guardian ad litembe appointed in all cases where a child is inneed of protective services. Currently, casesregarding truancy, runaways, or where an-other child of the same parent has been thesubject of a termination of parental rightshearing in the past five years, do not re-quire guardians. A conviction for homicide or assault would be added to the grounds for terminatingparental rights. In the event that a parent's rights are termi- nated, the courts would maintain jurisdic-tion over a child when either adoption orlong-term foster care is the intended dis-position. The Department of Human Services would look for strategies to recruit foster andadoptive families. Courts would be required to develop a system similar to the \"one judge, one fam-ily\" model used in Ramsey county. Teen court The bill would allow the establishment of teen courts, which would offer alternativesto juvenile proceedings in cases in which ateen is alleged to have committed a minoroffense. Teen courts could be established byany group of two or more adult sponsorswho are affiliated with an appropriate agencyor group, such as a school or communityservice organization. With the permission oflocal law enforcement, county attorneys,schools, or probation agencies; upon notifi-cation to the victim; and with the offender'sagreement and that of a jury of his or herpeers, the offense can be tried through teencourt. Teen courts could impose community ser- vice, counseling, treatment, law-related edu-cational classes, participation as a juror infuture teen court proceedings, restitution,or a small fine, to compensate for the crime. Other provisions say that the teen's par- ents or legal guardian must accompany himor her in all teen court proceedings. A teenmust acknowledge responsibility for the of-fense to qualify. Other agencies could refercases to teen court. In the event a teen fails to comply with the teen court's ruling, they could face a juvenilecourt proceeding or a school disciplinaryproceeding. General crime provisions The bill would make more than 30 changes to crime-fighting laws that range from in-creased penalties for repeat offenders tostudying exactly how much crime costs com-munities and society. Certain misdemeanor crimes, including prostitution, tampering with a motor ve-hicle, damage to property, and some weap-ons and controlled substance crimes, wouldbecome gross misdemeanors and subject toincreased penalties if the defendant has ahistory of committing those crimes. Themeasure is an effort to clean up neighbor-hoods plagued by petty crime and drug deal-ers. In that same interest, witnesses to thecrimes would be kept apprised of the finaloutcomes of the cases. The bill strengthens laws protecting po- lice and Department of Human Services em-ployees against assault. A person whocommits a first-degree assault against a po-lice officer would be subject to a mandatoryminimum sentence of 10 years behind bars.The bill would make it a gross misdemeanorto assault a human services employee whilethat person is performing a duty mandatedby law, if the assailant knows the victim is ahuman services employee, if the offensecauses significant bodily harm, and if theassailant is under commitment or beingevaluated for commitment due to mentalillness or psychopathic personality disorder;or is a sexually dangerous person. Elderly and handicapped persons would get more protection against con artists whoprey upon them. The bill would make it agross misdemeanor to commit certain typesof fraud that would cause the victim to loseassets or income. Criminals should stop when asked to by police. The bill would increase from a grossmisdemeanor to a three-year felony the crimeof fleeing a police officer by means of amotor vehicle. This year a loophole was discovered in the law regarding harboring a fugitive: It didn'tcover the abettor if the fugitive happened tobe on probation. The bill makes it clear that8 SESSION WEEKLY / April 25, 1997you can't harbor fugitives from the law \u2014 probationers or otherwise. Crime costs society in a myriad of ways: lost possessions, decreased property values,high-cost security systems, and high insur-ance payments. It also costs in terms of qual-ity of life: neighborhood degeneration andloss of a personal sense of security. The billwould request the legislative auditor to studythe direct and indirect costs of crime on thestate and local communities. The study willinclude the costs of \"responding to, pros-ecuting, and punishing criminal offenders,but also the indirect economic and socialcosts\" of crime. The report would be due tothe Legislature by February 1998. Stalking and harassment A 1993 law to protect victims of stalking and harassment had the wind pulled out ofits sails in a recent Supreme Court decision.For that reason, the Legislature has rewrittenthe law to restore and clarify the protection.The bill states that if a person \"knows or should know [the behavior] would cause thevictim persecuted, or intimidated,\" itconstitutes harassment. Importantly, the billsays that prosecutors do not have to provethe intent of the harasser or stalker \u2014 onlythat the behavior caused the victim to feelthreatened or harassed. It also adds certainbehaviors to those constituting stalking:sending messages or telephoning the victim,regardless of the destination of the commu-nications. Getting the final word In many states, including Minnesota, the defense in criminal cases gets the final wordon the courtroom floor. Some lawmakersbelieve this provides an unfair advantage tothe defense side. Under current law, the courtcan allow the prosecution to rebut, but onlyif it determines that the defense's closingargument contained misstatements. Theprosecution's rebuttal must pertain only tothe misstatements. The bill would change the rule so that prosecutors could have a right of rebuttal toany issues raised in the defendant's closingarguments. The defense could, in turn, re-spond to the rebuttal. Both sides would belimited to five minutes in these final argu-ments. Controlled substances/needle sales In addition to adding certain drugs to the list of controlled substances, the bill wouldchange the law pertaining to illegal drugs bypermitting the sale of hypodermic needlesand syringes without a prescription. The intent of the measure is to decrease the rateof HIV infection among drug users. Regis-tered pharmacists could sell the products inquantities of 10 or less. Sex offenders The bill would require sex offenders leav- ing federal prisons to register under the sexoffender registration law. The current lawcovers offenders leaving correctional facili-ties and halfway houses other than those inthe federal system. (The sex offender regis-tration law enables law enforcement agen-cies to notify communities when a releasedoffender moves in.) The bill also would addoffenders who commit indecent exposure tothose subject to the registration law. Also, the bill would also make it manda- tory for local law enforcement agencies todisclose the information to the public. Thecurrent law only authorizes them to do so. Young people would get greater protec- tion against window peeping and other in-vasions of privacy. Current law makes it amisdemeanor to surreptitiously gaze, stare,or peep in the window of a place \"wherereasonable persons would have an expecta-tion of privacy.\" Under the bill, if the victimis a minor under the age of 16, the crimewould constitute a gross misdemeanor, sub-ject to increased penalties. The bill would also provide five-year felony penalties for indecent exposure if the crimeinvolved confining or restricting the victim.The offender would also be required to sub-mit to DNA testing upon sentencing. Crime victims The Alex and Brandon Frank Child Safety Act Alex and Brandon Frank were two Minne- sota boys, aged four and five, murdered bytheir father last July. The crime occurredduring their parents' divorce proceedings.Many people feel the system failed to re-spond to warning signs that could havehelped prevent the tragedy. The bill would tighten the rules regarding visitation when a restraining order has beenfiled against one or the other parent. A petition for marriage dissolution would have to state whether a restraining order is ineffect. If so, a judge would have to considerthe restraining order before making a deci-sion regarding visitation. In deciding cus-tody issues, the judge would have to considerany finding of domestic abuse. The act also would award grants to create or maintain a family visitation center tosafely facilitate visitation decisions.Victims of juveniles The bill would create an exception to the rule that all information regarding juvenilecourt matters are closed to the public. Peoplewho are victimized by youthful offenderswould be allowed to learn the offender'sname upon request. The names would notbe released if doing so would interfere withthe trial or if the victim's motives are suspect. Vehicle theft People who have had their cars stolen would be notified within 48 hours after thepolice have recovered the car. Confidentiality Prosecutors could opt to withhold infor- mation pertaining to victim addresses orplaces of employment for the sake of victimsafety. Keeping victims posted In addition to other measures that would inform victims of the status of certain cases,the bill would require that they be notified ifa sentence for a felony might be modified orappealed. The bill also would add vehicularhomicide to the list of offenses that requirenotification. Inmate employment, computer access Earlier this year, the public learned that an inmate with a history of sex offenses waskeeping a list of names of Minnesota chil-dren. The list was compiled through accessto the Internet. Prisoners use computers forwork and educational purposes. The crime prevention bill would forbid inmates from participating in such workactivities unless adequate security is pro-vided by the facility. Access to the Internetwould be prohibited except for work, educa-tional, and vocational purposes. Regularmonitoring of inmate computer use wouldbe required. A related provision would restrict access by probationers and parolees to the Internet. Other controls on inmate work, not re- lated to security, require that inmates becompensated at a rate similar to that paid tonon-inmates for the same work, and that thework not displace other workers. A relatedbill provision says that work performed insentence to serve programs, in which of-fenders provide work services in lieu of con-finement, must not result in displacements. Nuisances Finally, in a measure intended to help neighborhoods, the bill strengthens tenantand nuisance laws. Prostitution and fire armsviolations would be added to prohibited be-haviors in landlord-tenant covenants. A per-9 April 25, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYson filing a complaint against a tenant for nuisance or other illegal behavior could re-quest an expedited hearing. If granted, thehearing would be held in five to seven daysafter a summons is issued. Further, a nui-sance abatement action would not be broughtif a property owner improves the problem oragrees to a plan to abate the problem within30 days of receiving notice. DEVELOPMENT Caritza Taina Mariani, accompanied her father, Rep. Carlos Mariani, on the House floor.Daughters were seen throughout the Capitol complex April 24, the fifth annual National TakeOur Daughters To Work Day.Daughters' DayEconomic development, housing A bill that spends $381 million on eco- nomic development throughout Minnesotaand another $63 million on housing pro-grams passed the House April 22 by a vote of79-52. The measure ( HF2158 ) merges omnibus bills from the Economic Development Fi-nance Division and the Housing and Hous-ing Finance Division. For economic development, the bill sets aside money over the 1998-1999 state bud-geting period for a diverse group of stateagencies, from the Minnesota Historical So-ciety to the Department of Economic Secu-rity. For housing, the bill appropriates money to aid the homeless, disabled, and first-timehome buyers through programs adminis-tered by the Minnesota Housing FinanceAgency. (See Session Weekly, April 18, 1997, page 6 and page 12). Among the bill's provisions is a $10 mil- lion appropriation to help Minnesota's wel-fare families train for jobs. Federal law nowrequires families to work to receive publicassistance. The bill also sets aside $10 million to help redevelop vacated, contaminated industrialland, known as brownfields, so new busi-nesses can move in and create jobs. Themoney would not be used for the cleanup ofthe contaminated land (a separate fund doesthat). Instead, the predevelopment and jobcreation grant program would pay costs suchas land acquisition, demolition of existingstructures, and relocation of individuals orbusinesses. Minnesota's film industry also would get a $1 million boost. The money would go to theMinnesota Film Board to establish a filmproduction jobs program. It would pay pro-ducers of long-form and narrative films whodirectly create film jobs in Minnesota. TheDepartment of Trade and Economic Devel-opment would oversee and authorize thepayments.Projects not receiving funding include the Minneapolis Convention Center and the St.Paul Civic Center. The Minneapolis Con-vention Center had asked for $37.5 millionto help expand its facilities and make it morecompetitive nationally. The St. Paul CivicCenter had asked for $51 million in statebonds to help renovate the Civic Center inthe hopes of attracting a professional icehockey franchise. Gov. Arne Carlson hadrecommended $4 million in funds for theCivic Center. HF2158 now travels to the Senate. In the area of housing, a variety of pro- grams were funded. The bill includes several programs to aid the homeless and prevent homelessness. Thelargest such appropriation would mark $5.7million for grants to organizations provid-ing case management to help low-incomepeople with poor rental histories rehabilitatetheir rental records and find housing. Part ofthe funding would also go to innovativeapproaches for housing people with poorrental histories. According to Department of Economic Security figures, the number of people usingemergency shelters and transitional housingin the state has tripled over the past 11 years.Of the 4,981 Minnesotans needing servicesin 1996, 44 percent were children. Any in-crease in homelessness triggered by federaland state welfare reforms going into effectthis year could strain an already overbur-dened support system. In other housing provisions, the Afford-able Rental Investment Fund would get $16.4 million for the biennium to provide no-interest first mortgages or deferred loans forlow-income rental housing. Householdsearning 80 percent of the state median in-come and in need of affordable housing arethe target of this program. Home ownership and rental opportuni- ties for low- and moderate-income Ameri-can Indians would be provided by twoprograms. The Urban Indian Housing Pro-gram would receive $187,000 per year toassist Indians living in urban areas. The TribalIndian Housing Program would get $1.7million to help Indians living in GreaterMinnesota. The Minnesota Urban and Rural Home- steading Program would get $186,000 peryear to acquire vacant, condemned, or aban-doned single family homes for rehabilitationand sale. The properties are offered to first-time homeowners on a contract-for-deedbasis. A program that provides deferred pay- ment loans to low-income homeowners forimprovements directly related to the basichousing needs of physically disabled peoplewould receive $4.3 million per year. Theprogram is operated by local agencies and islimited to households in which one or morepeople have a long-term disability that sub-stantially affects functioning in the home. A $1 million appropriation requested by House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL Brook-lyn Center) would pay for the acquisition,demolition, and removal of substandard multi-10 SESSION WEEKLY / April 25, 1997EDUCATIONSCHOOLunit rental property. The measure was added to the bill even though some members ques-tioned whether it would run counter to exist-ing state housing policy and lead to an actualdecrease in available low-income housing. K-12 bill clears House All public school students would spend an extra three days in school, and those who failthe state's graduation tests would get threeweeks of additional classroom time, under a$6.7 billion education funding bill passedApril 24 by the House. The vote was 96-38. The omnibus K-12 education finance bill (HF1684 ), sponsored by Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee), would increase state aidfor education by 13.5 percent over the nexttwo years and provide a variety of new mea-sures to improve student achievement. House members voted to delete a provi- sion in the bill that would have provided$500,000 in grants to help school districtsthat establish school start times of 8 a.m. orlater. The funds would have been earmarkedfor increased transportation costs expectedto accompany the move to later start times. Advocates of later start times claim ado- lescent students benefit greatly when theyare allowed to get a bit more sleep before theschool day begins. Better rested students aremore prepared to learn and less likely to bedisruptive in school, proponents claim. Critics argue that changing start times for adolescents can have costly repercussionsand that the problem may be more easilysolved by having students get to bed a littleearlier in the evening. Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall) offered the amendment to delete the grant fundingfor later start times. It was approved by amargin of 69-64. Kelso's bill would spend about $225.4 million more than Gov. Arne Carlson pro-posed for the 1998-1999 biennium. Some ofthe governor's major education initiatives\u2014 including his plan to provide increasedtax deductions and new tax credits for par-ents who send their children to privateschools \u2014 are absent from the bill. However, the bill does include provisions that would target funds to assist strugglingstudents, improve school bus safety, andallow for the creation of more charter schoolsand new laboratory schools. The Senate also passed its version of the education funding legislation April 24, butthe upper chamber's bill (DFL-Mpls), has significant provisions not foundin the House bill. The Senate bill would spend $6.9 billion and would provide $100 million to allowlow-income students to receive funds to at-tend \"common schools of excellence,\" whichwould include public or private schools thatmeet certain academic standards and otherrequirements. Differences between the House and Sen- ate bills will be reconciled in conferencecommittee. Here's a look at some of the major provi- sions of the House bill. A total of $5 billion would be devoted to general education funding for school dis-tricts during the two-year budget cycle.The bill would provide increases in the perpupil funding that districts receive for eachyear of the biennium. Districts currently receive $3,505 per pupil. The bill would add $75 in 1998,bringing the sum to $3,580 per pupil. In1999, another $8 would be added, andother changes would impact the per pupilformula during that year. District coop-eration funds that districts now receiveseparately would be rolled into the perpupil funding, but revenue for transpor-tation and teacher training would be rolledout. The result is that the per pupil amountwould be $3,355, but districts would showa net gain. The bill includes a total of $86.8 million to improve technology in schools and publiclibraries. A total of $30 million for one-time grants to help all school districts pur-sue improvements, and another $20 millionin grant funding would be available on acompetitive basis according to demon-strated needs of individual districts. Thebill also would provide another $19 mil-lion for telecommunication access grantsto help school districts and regional publiclibraries get connected to the Internet. A total of $52 million would be earmarked to provide the equivalent of three weeksadditional classroom time for students whofail the basic skills tests or are likely to fail.The additional hours could be logged afterschool, during weekends, or during thesummer. All students would spend three more days in the classroom during the 1997-1998school year. Under current law, the statesets no minimum for the number of daysin a school year, but most districts sched-ule about 170 days of instruction. A total of $6.9 million would be provided to districts for transportation safety funding.That would more than double the amount currently dispersed to districts on a perstudent basis. A total of $4 million wouldbe for designated purposes, including add-ing seat belts on buses, providing adultsafety monitors, installing video cameras,installing crossing arms, or adding exte-rior strobe lights. The bill includes the governor's recom- mendation to remove a provision in cur-rent state law capping the number of charterschools allowed in Minnesota at 40. Thebill also would make it easier for existingschools to convert to charter school status. The bill includes $5 million for laboratory schools that would be distributed in grantsto at least three postsecondary institutionsfor the establishment of schools to fosterinnovative teaching techniques. Fundingfor laboratory schools would be availableto public or private postsecondaryinstitutions. A number of provisions crafted to boost accountability in the schools are includedin the bill. For example, a new state officeof educational accountability would be es-tablished. The office would monitor theperformance of Minnesota schools and stu-dents and report results directly to thepublic. Also, $5 million would be ear-marked for implementation of a statewidetesting system (as yet to be determined thissession by lawmakers) designed to mea-sure educational outcomes in publicschools. Larger school districts would be allowed to exceed the salary cap in current law forschool superintendents. State law now capsthe salary of school superintendents at 95percent of the governor's salary of $114,506a year. Some school districts have com-plained that the cap hurts their ability tocompete with districts in other states fortop superintendent candidates. The billwould allow districts with more than 5,000students to exceed the current salary cap aslong as the superintendents achieve per-formance incentives included in theircontracts.

HF1692/SF1342* memorializes the U.S. Congress to recognize Earth Day on April 22of each year as a national day of service andeducation. The bill also establishes EarthDay as a state day of service and education. Both the House and Senate passed the bill April 22. The House voted 115-11 and theSenate voted 56-0. Rep. Willard Munger(DFL-Duluth) sponsored the bill in theHouse and Sen. Jane Krentz (DFL-MayTownship) was the Senate sponsor. Earth Day has been celebrated informally by environmentally concerned citizens sincethe spring of 1970 when environmental lead-ers staged a nationwide teach-in. The day isoften marked with volunteer environmentalcleanup efforts and public education pro-grams. Earth Day has now gone interna-tional with programs planned in severalcountries. The bill, which is on its way to the governor's desk, directs the secretary of stateto transmit the state's wishes to the presidentof the United States and leaders of the U.S.Congress. Environmental spending bill Following several hours of debate and 18 amendment attempts, the omnibus envi-ronment, natural resources, and agriculturefinance bill ( HF2150 ) passed the House April 21. The vote was 110 to 23. State spending for environment and agri- culture programs will total almost $624 mil-lion over the next two-year budget cycle,under the omnibus bill. Included are fundsfor the Department of Natural Resources(DNR), the Minnesota Pollution ControlAgency (MPCA), the Minnesota Zoo, theDepartment of Agriculture, and several otherstate agencies. A little more than 62 percent of the state spending in the bill \u2014 almost $388 million\u2014 goes to the DNR. The MPCA, the nextlargest recipient under the bill, will receiveabout $83 million. The Department of Agri-culture gets $52.4 million. The spending bill also includes nearly $37 million for 89 environmental and recre-ational programs selected by the LegislativeCommission on Minnesota Resources(LCMR), which is funded from a 2-cent-per-pack cigarette tax and limited state lot-tery proceeds.House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon) unsuccessfully attempted to re-in-sert a provision abolishing the LCMR. (TheHouse Ways and Means Committee hadremoved the LCMR provision from the billApril 18.) Sviggum's amendment would have re- placed the LCMR membership with theHouse Environment, Natural Resources andAgriculture Finance Committee and the Sen-ate Environment and Agriculture BudgetDivision. The LCMR recommends fundingfor projects to enhance and protect the state'snatural resources after an extensive publicreview process. LCMR recommendationsmust be approved by the Legislature. State parks and recreation areas will get more than $57.5 million, a spending in-crease of $3.5 million over the previous two-year budget. Agriculture programs willreceive $52.4 million \u2014 $27.4 million infiscal year 1998 and $25 million in fiscal year1999. Of that amount, $44.6 million willsubsidize ethanol producers over the two-year period. An amendment to increase theethanol spending to $49.6 million, offeredby Rep. Elaine Harder (R-Jackson), failed. There are currently eight ethanol plants in Minnesota that produce a total of 92 milliongallons of ethanol per year \u2014 short of the120 million gallons needed for Minnesota tobecome ethanol self-sufficient. Since Octo-ber 1995, automobiles in the 10-county met-ropolitan area have been required to burn\"oxygenated fuel\" year round. BeginningOct. 1, 1997, all gasoline sold in the state willhave to be oxygenated. A rally in support of legislation to clean up and redevelop polluted industrial properties, knownas brownfields, is reflected in the hub cap of a dump truck that hauled in polluted dirt for theevent, which was held near the Capitol April 22.Rally reflectionThe bill appropriates $5.1 million each year for snowmobile trails and enforcement.Most of the money will go to local snowmo-bile clubs to pay for trail grooming under thestate grants-in-aid program. More than $86.5 million will be spent in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 on programs forlake, stream, and wildlife area management. Nearly $2 million is marked for non-game wildlife management programs. Another $2.7million will fund game and fish critical habi-tat programs and wetlands protection underthe Reinvest in Minnesota (RIM) program. The MPCA will continue existing pro- grams to clean up Minnesota lakes and riverswith $23.3 million in state funds, under thebill. It would receive another $15.4 millionfor air pollution programs, and almost $31.2million for protection of groundwater andmanagement of solid waste. The Senate amended HF2150 and passed it April 22. The bill now goes to a conferencecommittee. GOVERNMENT Omnibus data practices bill On April 14, the House unanimously passed the data practices omnibus bill. Thevote was 125-0. \"The bill allows greater access to some information and less to other information inways that I think are appropriate,\" said Rep.Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights),sponsor of the bill and chair of the Judiciary12 SESSION WEEKLY / April 25, 1997Committee's Data Practices Subcommittee. Bills confined to data practices have been introduced in the House since 1984, and thedata practices subcommittee has met since1987. Each year the committee considersnew alterations to the state's Data PracticesAct. \"The Legislature is handling the issuesin a deliberative way,\" said Don Gemberlingof the Public Information Policy AnalysisDivision of the Department of Administra-tion. \"This year's bill is a little smaller, butdeals with a lot of separate issues.\" That's because living in the Information Age poses a multitude of questions regard-ing the collection and dissemination of data,and the classification of data as either publicor private, he said. \"Lots and lots of billscame up this time. I think it's interesting thatwe've gone back to where the discussionstarted, which isn't [concern about] the pub-lic finding out information as much as it isthe collection of information by the govern-ment,\" Gemberling said. This year's omnibus bill ( SF1460 ) rily affects three areas of to anddissemination of records by law enforce-ment agencies; the treatment of studenthealth records; and the treatment of juvenileoffender records. The bill next will be taken up a House- Senate conference committee. Access by law enforcement The bill would make it easier for law en- forcement agencies to collect data on fugi-tives from the law if a fugitive happens to becollecting welfare benefits, or if the localsocial service agency has reason to believeanother individual on welfare could provideinformation about the fugitive. The bill says that certain welfare and hous- ing data may be disclosed to law enforce-ment officers regarding felons who are fleeingto avoid prosecution, custody or confine-ment, or are violating a condition of proba-tion or parole. The social service agency alsowould provide information on other indi-viduals if it is necessary to help catch thefugitive. The agency would be required toprovide the address, social security number,and photographs of the individual or otherhousehold members receiving food stamps.The bill also eliminates a requirement thatthe police provide the individual's socialsecurity number. Housing agencies wouldbe required to provide that same informa-tion. No information was available regarding how many cases these new provisions wouldaffect each year. The bill also would require the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) to put cer-tain criminal history data on the Internet, including a convicted criminal's identity andoffense record, which already are consideredpublic. The BCA is currently required toprovide that information at no chargethrough a computer monitor a its centraloffice. Student health records Current law requires elementary and sec- ondary schools to maintain student healthrecords \u2014 mostly immunizations \u2014 forever.The bill would change the requirement sothat schools keep those records until a stu-dent turns 23. Further, schools no longerwould be required to transfer a child's healthrecords to the health department when thestudent leaves the school. (This section of thebill was amended on the floor to prohibitthose records from being used in an immuni-zation registry. But because schools do notsubmit them for that purpose and the registrybill would not require them to, it is not clearwhat effect, if any, this provision will have.) The bill also would loosen provisions re- garding required tetanus and diphtheria(DPT) immunizations. A student who hasreceived three doses, with the last havingbeen received between the ages of six and 11,is not required to have additional immuni-zations for another 10 years. The law cur-rently requires that students in later gradesmust have had an immunization at 11 yearsof age or older. A third provision regarding student records would make it clear that school dis-tricts or school boards have the authority toenforce immunization requirements. Cur-rent law specifies that students must submitthose records within 30 days after enrollingin a new school, but does not say who hasenforcement authority. The bill also wouldexempt crisis nurseries from the immuniza-tion requirements. Juvenile records The bill would help the BCA collect some information on juveniles and authorize theagency to disclose other information. The computerized information the bu- reau currently keeps on juvenile criminalhistories is considered private. Some of itcan, however, be disclosed to other law en-forcement agencies and the court system.Under the bill, that information also couldbe disclosed to agencies in other states. Italso would clarify that the information re-leased for background checks must pertainto the juvenile's adjudication \u2014 or court \u2014history. The bill also would require the BCA to keep juvenile records \"for the longest timeperiod applicable to any item in the indi- vidual juvenile history record.\" That couldmean permanently if the juvenile goes on tocommit crimes as an adult. Conversely, the bill would require that the records be disposed of quickly should thecharges fail to stick. The bill provides that ina dismissal, the records would be destroyedimmediately. If the juvenile is not referred toa program or no petition has been filed withinsix months after the arrest, the files must bedestroyed. If the juvenile is referred to a diversion program \u2014 an alternative to jail, after whichthe record is cleared \u2014 the files are de-stroyed after he or she reaches age 21. If thejuvenile is guilty of a gross misdemeanor orfelony, the files are maintained until thejuvenile reaches age 28. The bill says that anagency that receives juvenile data from theBCA must destroy it according to the sameschedule. Other juvenile data provisions would re- quire that other law enforcement agencies toprovide the BCA with records on juvenileswho commit gross misdemeanors or felo-nies. Targeted misdemeanors include DWIand order for protection violations; fifthdegree assaults interference with privacy;harassment or restraining order violations;and indecent exposure. The bill also would require the BCA to give any other relevant information \u2014 notnecessarily included in the official juvenilerecords \u2014 to police departments to help ininvestigations. Finally, the bill would provide the public defender's office with electronic access topublic criminal and juvenile justice data. Other provisions The bill also makes changes to laws re- garding access to information on people insome professions. Judges and police officerscould request to have their names omittedfrom lists naming registered voters; andpeople in health care professions would beallowed to use addresses other than theirhome address for public purposes. Advo-cates for those provisions said they werenecessary to maintain the individuals' secu-rity. \"It raises an interesting question,\"Gemberling said. \"If it's good for somepeople, maybe it's good for others.\" The law would change regarding the records of the deceased. Health care provid-ers could destroy records seven years after apatient's death, and survivors and other in-terested parties would have fewer obstaclesin obtaining access to tax returns filed by oron behalf of someone who has died. The bill would eliminate the requirement13 April 25, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYthat government entities pay $200 to the Department of Administration for opinionsrelated to data practices law. Other bill provisions deal with tax law. For instance, the IRS could disclose to thelottery the amount of a winner's delinquentstate taxes if the individual won $600 ormore. Currently, the minimum winningsbefore disclosure is $1,000. Rap vs. Rachmaninoff It came down to rap vs. Rachmaninoff, said Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) at the April23 House Ways and Means Committee meet-ing. Rachmaninoff won when the committee voted to delete a section of the omnibus stategovernment finance bill that would haverequired Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) tosell its classical music station \u2014 KSJN-FM99.5 \u2014 to a minority-owned group with arap music format before MPR could receiveany additional public funding. The MPR must-sell provision was backed by Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City) whomaintained that MPR misused tax dollars tooutbid a minority-owned private group whenthe station came up for sale. That privatebuyer, Osskopp said, would have created astation that played an urban/contemporaryformat and served the Twin Cities' African-American community. Overall, the Ways and Means Committee eliminated many controversial provisionsand passed out a bill ( SF1905 ) that appro- priates $629 million to fund state govern-ment activity such as the Legislature, courts,administrative agencies, and numerous of-fices, boards, and commissions. The committee also deleted a section that contained pay raises for elected officials,judges, and administrative executives, alongwith a provision that would have required astate agency \u2014 including Minnesota statecolleges and universities \u2014 to obtain statepermission before contracting out consult-ant services worth more than $25,000. Members also deleted a provision that would raise the minimum wage forMinnesota's workers. Effective Sept. 1, 1997,the wage would raise to at least $5.40 perhour for employees of larger companies and$5.15 per hour for employees of smallercompanies. The provision will be consid-ered as a separate bill. \"These are things that should be dealt with separately, and not in the state departmentfinance bill,\" said House Speaker Phil Car-ruthers (DFL-Brooklyn Park). Thomas Ross, of Minneapolis, held up a classicalcompact disc and told the House Ways and MeansCommittee April 23 that he has nothing againstclassical music but would like to see MinnesotaPublic Radio (MPR) sell their classical FM radiostation. A provision in the omnibus stategovernment finance bill would have made an$809,000 state appropriation to MPR contingentupon their sale of the station, which was purchased,in part, with public funds. It was later deleted fromthe bill.Committee members added a provision that would establish a new juvenile courtaimed at keeping low-level offenders out ofthe criminal justice system. SF1905 provides a one-time $250,000 ap- propriation to the Office of Strategic andLong-Range Planning to help establish \"teencourts\" to be set up by a group of two ormore adult sponsors approved by the agency.As a participant in a teen court, juvenileoffenders accused of a minor offense wouldgo before a jury of their peers. If convicted,sentences would range from community ser-vice and mandatory counseling to payingfines and restitution. The House Rules and Legislative Admin- istration Committee also approved the bill,as amended by Ways and Means, April 23. Itnow goes to the House floor. (See Session Weekly , April 18, 1997, page 10)HUMAN SERVICES Omnibus bill advances Same sex marriages would be prohibited, drug addicts could buy clean needles at theirlocal pharmacy, and state hospital patientsburied years ago in unmarked graves wouldbe recognized, under the omnibus healthand human services spending bill. The $5.4 billion bill pays for state health and social service programs over the nexttwo years and includes a hodgepodge ofprojects and policy changes in its 365 pages. A large chunk of the bill's price tag \u2014 $1.7 billion \u2014 would pay to cover the health careneeds of poor Minnesotans under two sepa-rate programs: Medical Assistance and Gen-eral Assistance Medical Care. Another $2.2 billion would pay for certain nursing home, disability, mental health,group housing, chemical dependency, andother long term care services. About $422 million would fund the state's welfare program which was overhauled thissession after the federal government scrappedthe old system, cut benefits to legal immi-grants, and required welfare recipients towork. The bill ( SF1908 ), sponsored by Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), passed the HouseWays and Means Committee April 24. Itheads next to the floor. Below are some of the highlights in the bill. Same-sex marriages The bill prohibits marriages between people of the same gender and prohibits therecognition of such marriages in Minnesotaeven if the marriage occurred in a state thatallows people of the same gender to marry. The proposal began as an attempt to re- spond to the possibility that Hawaii mayrecognize same-sex marriages and preparefor people who might move to Minnesotafrom that state. Hawaii had passed a lawprohibiting same sex marriages, but a lowercourt ruled the law unconstitutional. Thestate has appealed to its state Supreme Court. Clean needles To help prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS among drug addicts, the bill wouldallow pharmacies to sell, without prescrip-tion, new hypodermic needles and syringes.They could only be sold from behind thecounter and not readily available on storeshelves. 14 SESSION WEEKLY / April 25, 1997 Naming the dead The bill would spend $200,000 to replace the unmarked or numbered graves of thou-sands of mentally retarded people who dieddecades ago while patients in Minnesota'sstate hospitals. The state dollars, however,would be withheld until private money raisedto replace the grave sites has been exhausted. Child care licensing With the federal welfare changes requir- ing parents on public assistance to work ifthey want a monthly helping hand, officialsanticipate a huge increase in the demand forchild care. The bill sets aside $200,000 to addtwo more fire marshal positions to the De-partment of Human Services' licensing divi-sion to speed up the licensing of child careprograms. A separate House bill deals withmany other licensing requirements for childcare programs. Assistance dogs Minnesota nonprofit groups that train dogs to help people with disabilities wouldreceive $50,000 over the 1998-1999 two-year state budgeting period. The dogs areoften rescued from animal shelters and helptheir owners to lead independent lives athome and at work. Teen gambling Lottery money in the amount of $250,000 over the biennium would fund a compulsivegambling prevention and education projectfor adolescents in St. Louis County.Women's mental health crisis center Hennepin County would become home to a one-year experimental center for womenwho are experiencing a mental health crisisas a result of childhood physical or sexualabuse. The bill spends $250,000 in fiscal year1998 and instructs the county to contractwith a four-bed adult foster care facility. Women, Infants and Children To make up for recent federal cuts to the Women, Infants and Children nutritionalprogram, the bill spends $650,000 in 1998 tomaintain the current caseload level of about95,500 monthly cases. Otherwise, some 1,900women and children would have been cutoff. In addition to the $650,000, the billappropriates another $1.5 million to the pro-gram which provides supplemental food,nutritional counseling, and health screen-ings for low-income, high-risk pregnant,breast feeding, and postpartum women, in-fants, and children under the age of five. Father adoption registry The bill appropriates $286,000 over the 1998-1999 budgeting period to pay for theDepartment of Health to register the namesof fathers \u2014 or potential fathers \u2014 with thestate. A separate bill carries the specifics of the registry where men who want to be a part oftheir children's lives can be assured of noti-fication if their child is put up for adoption.The registry is a way to protect a birth father'srights in the event his child is put up for Prescription pricesINSURANCEINSURANCE Minnesota Senior Federation members, right to left , Jim Stahl, St. Paul, Charles Spooner, Minneapolis, Gene Taylor, Minneapolis, and Janis Ray, West Concord, each wear a prescriptionbottle and a badge that reads \"Vote for Fair Rx Prices for All\" as they listen to the House debateSF1905 April 24. A discount prescription drug program is contained in the bill.adoption, and to protect children from hav-ing adoptions unduly disrupted. No insurance rate hikes A bill headed for the governor's desk would prevent insurance rate hikes for people whoare passengers on city buses involved in traf-fic accidents. The bill, sponsored by Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul), passed the House April 21 bya margin of 131-0. The Senate passed the billApril 16 by a margin of 67-0. Sen. RandyKelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored the bill inthat body. The impetus for the legislation came from an 86-year-old resident of Farrell's legisla-tive district in St. Paul. The woman was injured in January 1997 after she boarded a city bus to return to herEast Side home from a doctor's office indowntown St. Paul. As the woman walkedtoward an open seat, the bus slammed to astop to avoid a collision. The sudden stop sent the woman toppling backwards, bouncing off the windshield,and landing at the bottom of the steps insidethe bus door. She wound up spending fivedays in the hospital with a variety of injuriesand has since gone through weeks of physi-cal therapy. Unfortunately, the woman had to absorb another blow when she returned from thehospital and called the bus company to dis-cuss the accident. She was informed that thebus company would not pay for any medicalexpenses she incurred. That, she was told,was the responsibility of her own insurancecompany. The state's no-fault insurance law requires that the woman's coverage come under herown automobile insurance policy. Farrell's bill ( HF1045*/SF759 ) would pro- vide a remedy for people in such a situationwithout taking on the highly controversialarea of no-fault law. The bill would prohibit insurance compa- nies from increasing a policyholder's pre-mium if the person is involved in an accidentwhile a passenger in a bus, taxi, or commutervan. Farrell said his constituent did not see an increase in auto insurance rates after theincident on the city bus, but that he hopes toprevent anyone else in similar circumstancesfrom seeing a rate hike.15 April 25, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYTRANSPORTATION NOTESDiabetes management Health plans would be required to pro- vide coverage for training and education toassist diabetics in managing their disease,under a bill headed for the governor's desk. The bill ( HF653/SF495* ) was passed by the House April 18 by a margin of 124-5. TheSenate voted 62-2 to pass the bill April 21. The bill would expand a 1994 law requir- ing medical insurance companies and healthmaintenance organizations to provide cov-erage for syringes, blood-testing devices, andother equipment diabetics need. The aim of the proposal is to ensure dia- betics are properly trained to use the medicalequipment and to monitor their own condi-tion. Medical nutrition therapy also wouldbe required to be included in health cover-age, under the bill. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Tom Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) and Sen. Steve Novak(DFL-New Brighton). Omnibus transportation bill The omnibus transportation finance bill was adopted by the House April 23. Theproposal ( SF1881 ), which appropriates $3 billion in state dollars for roads, bridges,aviation, and public safety over the next twoyears, passed on a 102-30 vote. The state's authority to build toll roads also would be repealed by the bill. The Leg-islature created that authority only four yearsago as a possible means to pay for the ever-rising cost of highway construction. \"Peoplehave told us that they don't like tolls,\" saidRep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen), spon-sor of the amendment. Workman is con-cerned that Highway 212 in his district wouldbe converted to a pay-to-drive road. The bill also was amended to require that motorists on freeways use the left lane onlyfor passing. A ticket would be issued and afine imposed for improper use of the leftlane. Another amendment sponsored by Rep. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka) would allow trail-ers carrying dirt bikes, all-terrain vehicles, orsnowmobiles to be attached to a fifth-wheelstyle camper trailer towed by a pickup truck.Towing of boat trailers in this configurationis already allowed under current law. A conference committee will soon be ap- pointed to resolve differences between theHouse and Senate proposals. (See April 18, 1997, Session Weekly , page 15.)Transit The Metropolitan Council, which runs the metropolitan area's public transporta-tion system, would receive $130.1 millionover the morethan Gov. Arne recommended. Ofthat money, $34.6 million would go to MetroMobility, which provides rides to approxi-mately 25,000 metropolitan-area people withdisabilities. The bill also authorizes and fundsa $100,000 study of coordinating public tran-sit and school transportation in the cities ofMinneapolis and St. Paul. An additional $29.6 million would go to assist transit programs in GreaterMinnesota. Road and bridge construction State road construction projects would receive $893 million for the next two years.Local roads would get $841.6 million in stateaid, local bridges, $39.8 million. Public safety The bill calls for $111.6 million in spend- ing for the Minnesota State Patrol. Includedis $3.5 million to fund an additional 29 statetroopers \u2014 not the full complement re-quested by the governor, but 29 more thanthe Legislature authorized last year. The gov-ernor refused to enact a speed limit increasecalled for by lawmakers in 1996 because thetrooper funding was missing. Also included is $2 million for computer- aided dispatching and records managementand $1.7 million to install video cameras instate patrol vehicles. Another $69.5 millionwould go to the department's Driver andVehicle Services Division over the next bien-nium. Also, $2.6 million would go to theDepartment of Public Safety and the Minne-sota Safety Council for various public safetyprograms. The bill includes $652,000 to provide sur- vivor benefits to the families of state patrolofficers who have died or been disabled inthe line of duty. Though they are eligible forpensions, many of these officers and theirfamilies have lost their health care benefitsonce they could no longer serve as peaceofficers. An average of three officers per yearlose their lives in the line of duty inMinnesota. Aviation The bill appropriates $36.3 million for air transportation programs, including $26 mil-lion for airport development and assistance.Other funds support the Civil Air Patrol andprovide general support for aviation in thestate.Railroads and waterways A total of $6.9 million would go to fund rail and water transportation. This includesa $1 million study to look at utilizing existingfreight railroad corridors for a commuterrail service in the metropolitan area. With the close of this year's session rap- idly approaching, and a passel of omnibusbills still on the table, legislators aren't theonly ones to feel an increased sense of ur-gency. Lobbyists are also working harder toget their points across \u2014 some, apparently,a little too hard. \"I've been asked by some members to ask lobbyists not to follow them into the wash-room,\" House Taxes Committee chair Rep.Dee Long (DFL-Mpls) announced at an April21 meeting. Some things are, after all, not subject to debate.Q: How are bills amended? A: Bills going through the Legislature are often amended, which can greatly changethe thrust of a bill. Most often legislators make amendments to bills when they are being considered incommittee. Committee members are usu-ally well-versed in the subjects of the bills,and they have the time at this point to con-sider making changes. Legislators can alsoamend bills when they reach the House floor.In both cases, amendments are adopted by amajority vote. Generally, the legislator offering the amendment will have the proposal draftedby legislative staff before offering it for dis-cussion. Q: When do new laws go into effect? A: Most new laws go into effect on Aug. 1 following a legislative session unless a billspecifies another date. Exceptions are billsthat contain an appropriation, which be-come effective July 1, the same date the fiscalyear begins.16 SESSION WEEKLY / April 25, 1997A bill that attracted little controversy as it sailed through the Minnesota Legisla-ture in 1925 later became the subject of an uproar that touched the lives of promi- nent public officials and thecenter of a landmark rulingin constitutional law. The 1925 law \u2014 perhaps the most direct effort to al-low suppression of the presssince the passage of theAlien and Sedition Acts in1798 \u2014 declared certaintypes of newspapers and other publications a nuisance and allowedfor injunctions to halt their circulation. The circumstances that prompted passage of the law are somewhat uncertain. Appar-ently, it was backed by a legislator intent onsilencing a newspaper editor who was at-tacking him. But the editor died before thelaw could be applied to his work, accordingto an analysis of the case by John Hartmannpublished in the December 1960 edition ofMinnesota History . State Sen. Freling H. Stevens, a Progres- sive-Republican from Minneapolis, spon-sored the bill in upper chamber, where themeasure moved quickly through committeeand passed easily on the Senate floor. Simi-larly strong support greeted the bill in theHouse, and Gov. Theodore Christiansonsigned the legislation into law at the close ofthe 1925 session. Specifically, the law declared it a nuisance to publish \"an obscene, lewd, and lasciviousnewspaper, magazine or other periodical, ora malicious, scandalous, and defamatorynewspaper, magazine, or other periodical.\" The law set up procedures allowing a county attorney to bring action in districtcourt to receive a temporary restraining or-der blocking circulation of a publication andallowing the court to grant a permanentinjunction to prevent future circulation of apublication. In the 1920s world of \"yellow journal- ism,\" it was only a matter of time before acounty attorney somewhere in the statewould use the new law to silence one of thatday's many purveyors of newspaper sensa-tionalism. As it turned out, the 1925 gag law would be put to the test when Hennepin County At-torney Floyd B. Olson \u2014 soon to be gover-nor of Minnesota \u2014 brought action in 1927to stop distribution of the Saturday Press , aYellow journalism . . . Press freedom ruling stems from 1925 state gag law weekly Minneapolis scandal sheet published by Howard A. Guilford and Jay M. Near. Guilford and Near were old hands in the wild world of newspaper publishing. In ear-lier days, both had served as editor of theTwin City Reporter , a sensational weekly published from 1915 to 1927. Each issue ofthe paper followed a prescription calling forsteady doses of sex, sexual perversion, andattacks on public officials and prominentcitizens. When Guilford and Near began publish- ing the Saturday Press in September 1927, they announced a crusade to clean up Min-neapolis by exposing corruption among pub-lic officials. The paper's first target was Chiefof Police Frank W. Brunskill, whom the pub-lishers claimed was aligned with powerfulgangsters who were \"practically ruling Min-neapolis.\" Soon the publishers extended their criti- cism to the mayor and to Olson, whom Nearand Guilford attacked for failing to replacethe police chief or to charge him for wrong-doing. Olson quickly responded by asking a Hennepin County District Court judge togrant an injunction to block circulation ofthe Saturday Press . The lawyers for Guilford and Near did not challenge Olson's claim that the newspaperfit the description of a nuisance under the\"gag law.\" They based their defense on theclaim that the law was unconstitutional \u2014setting off a lengthy legal battle that wouldend in the U.S. Supreme Court. The district court ruled against Guilford and Near, as did the Minnesota SupremeCourt in 1928. A permanent injunction wasissued, and the publishers were out of busi-ness. However, the case had by then attracted the attention of publishers of major newspa-pers around the country. Chicago Tribune , New York Times , and Cleveland Plain Dealer editorialists weighed in on behalf of Guilfordand Near and ripped the Minnesota law. Colonel Robert R. McCormick, publisher of the Chicago Tribune, took up the cause of the Minneapolis publishers and providedfinancial backing to appeal the case to thenation's highest court. (The case would carryonly Near's name because Guilford with-drew from the litigation.) In the meantime, attempts were made in the Legislature to repeal the \"gag law,\" but allwere unsuccessful. In 1931, while the case was pending before the U.S. Supreme Court,Olson began his first term as governor bycalling for the repeal of the law he had em-braced four years earlier. \"The cases in which the law was used were proper exercises of the operation of the law,but I believe that the possibilities for abusemake it an unwise law,\" Olson said, accord-ing to Minnesota History . \"The freedoms of speech and the press should remaininviolate . . .\" Members of the House voted that year to repeal the law, but a powerful minority inthe Senate used a procedural move to blockthe effort during the final days of the session. Later in 1931, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision in the case of Near v. Min-nesota. Although the justices were split by a5-4 margin, the court's ruling would becomea significant milepost in the history of con-stitutional law. The majority opinion effectively \"nation- alized\" the freedoms of speech and press bywiping out a state law limiting such liberties,according to Minnesota History . And the ruling provided a powerful precedent for-bidding prior restraint of the press. However, Justice Pierce Butler \u2014 the first Minnesotan appointed to the Supreme Courtand the leader of the dissenters \u2014 arguedthat a ruling in favor of Near would renderthe states powerless. With the injunction finally lifted, Near resumed publishing the Saturday Press later that year, but the newspaper took on a decid-edly less inflammatory tone. Guilford soon started a new publication called the Pink Sheet , but the paper was short-lived. He returned to the Saturday Press within a year. In 1934, Guilford was shot and killed as he drove toward his Minneapolis home. Someclaimed the gangsters and corrupt officialsGuilford had tried to expose were respon-sible for his death, but no solid evidence wasfound to support such claims. The case wentunsolved. \u2014 Nick Healy Jay M. Near Photo courtesy Minnesota Historical Society17 April 25, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYThere's a booming worldwide agricultural industry that wouldseem to be a natural forMinnesota's fertile soil. It centerson a crop that has no disease prob-lems, requires no pesticides, growsquickly and densely and the en-tire plant can be used to makecommercial products. Unfortu-nately, the plant is hemp, a closecousin of mind-altering mari-juana, and outlawed in the UnitedStates under the 1972 ControlledSubstances Act. Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe (DFL-Ada) has sponsored abill ( SF1182 ) that would make Minnesota the first state to autho-rize the farming of hemp. The pro-posal is now awaiting action beforethe full Senate. The House versionof the bill ( HF349 ), sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls),calls for the state to study the issueof commercial hemp farming. It'spending before the House. Proponents say the state could reap huge economic benefits withan early entry into the hemp busi-ness. Opponents \u2014 largely lawenforcement agencies \u2014 make nodistinction between industrialhemp, which scientists say is notmind-altering, and its intoxicat-ing relative. They say hemp's le-galization would underminecurrent anti-drug efforts. The business of hemp What cannot be argued is that hemp pro- duction is a booming business. The numberof retail stores nationwide selling hemp prod-ucts, according to David Morris, of the Min-neapolis-based Local Institute forSelf-Reliance, has risen from 2 in 1988 toover 1,200 today. In 1993, worldwide hempsales were $5 million. By 1995, sales stood at$75 million, according to Hemptech, a Cali-fornia company that tracks the industry. Itestimates the amount will top $200 millionin 1997, and $600 million by 2001. In the lastfew years, industrialized hemp has been le-galized in Germany, Canada, the UnitedKingdom, and Australia. Once cultivated by both George Washing- ton and Thomas Jefferson, hemp is nowused in a variety of products, including pa- Agricultural boom . . . Minnesota hemp: a new financial high for farmers?

A draft of the Declaration of Indepen-dence was written on hemp paper and theU.S. flag sewn by Betsy Ross was made ofhemp. (The newest byproduct, Hempen Ale,made with sterilized hemp seeds, will hitliquor stores April 28.) Hemp products havealways been legal, and many of them areimported. Others are manufactured in theUnited States \u2014 since hemp commerce isprotected by the General Agreement on Tar-iffs and Trade \u2014 with hemp brought fromAsia or Europe, where the plant has beenfarmed for thousands of years. History of hemp use Hemp is believed to have been first used by the Chinese for its stem fiber around 5000B.C. It was growing in Chile by 1545 and inthe American colony at Jamestown in 1619.It was here the first law regarding marijuanawas passed: Farmers were ordered to grow was as a heavy cord fiber, orrope. Its natural resistance to rotwas perfect \u2014 and in great de-mand \u2014 for maritime uses, in-cluding sails. As Europeanseafaring expanded, so did theimportance of hemp. The crop moved west with the pioneers, with Kentucky being theprincipal producer of hemp fiberuntil the Civil War. At about thistime, in 1860, the first small cropscame to Minnesota. Thirty years later, state busi- ness executives and governmentofficials were touting the virtuesof hemp. \"[T]his fibrous plant ought to be raised to advantage in this state.The soil is favorable and nearlyevery vacant lot in Minneapolisand St. Paul, shows a luxuriantcrop of the plant growing wild,without cultivation, and I havepersonally cut a stem fifteen feethigh, in Minneapolis,\" wrote J.Carmichael Allen, a director ofMinneapolis Linen Mills, in 1891. A report the same year from the Minnesota House Committee toInvestigate Flax and Hemp said \"to each farmer in this state, grow flax; growhemp; study flax; study hemp.\" It cited thesuccess of J.T. Smith, a farmer from HeronLake, Minn., who grew 500 acres of hemp in1890. Smith's argument for widespread hempfarming is similar to that used by propo-nents today. \"A market is found in all the large cities of this country for hemp fiber,\" he said. (One of Smith's likely customers was the Stillwater State Prison, where inmates madetwine and rope from hemp from the late1800s until 1957.) A bill to subsidize the production of hemp in Minnesota \"of a quality suitable for themaking of binder twine,\" was introduced inthe 1891 House. It called for a $2 paymentfor every 100 pounds of fiber. But despite calls for its increased produc- Photo courtesy Minnesota Historical Society Continued on page 1818 SESSION WEEKLY / April 25, 1997tion, large-scale processing facilities wouldn't appear until the 1930s. Hemp processing plants The first plant, National Cellulose Corpo- ration (later renamed the Hemp ChemicalCorporation) appeared in Mankato in 1933,followed by two additional plants in Winonain 1937. The Winona Republican-Herald trumpeted the industry as one \"which promoters see agood future development bringing an in-crease in jobs . . . and a new and profitablecash crop for Winona area farmers.\" The larger of the two Winona plants, Chempco, Inc., which removed fiber fromraw hemp, had 40 employees and took hempfrom local farmers grown on about 950 acres.The smaller operation, Cannabis, Inc., had12 employees and spun hemp fiber to makerugs, mops, and \"cloth used in upholsteringfurniture,\" the Republican-Herald said. But despite local optimism, the federal Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 and anti-drugsentiment brought the fledgling industry toa quick halt. During World War II, the in-dustry was briefly resurrected, when Presi-dent Franklin D. Roosevelt initiated the\"Hemp for Victory\" campaign. \"With Philippine and East Indian sources of hemp in the hands of the Japanese. . .Ameri-can hemp must meet the needs of our Armyand Navy as well as our industry,\" the narra-tor read in a 1942 U.S. Department of Agri-culture film. \"Just as in the days when OldIronsides sailed the seas victorious with herhempen shrouds and hempen sails,\" the filmconcludes. \"Hemp for victory.\" The arguments Today, industrial hemp is permitted in 26 countries and nearly a dozen states are dis-cussing the issue. Most recently, North Da-kota Gov. Edward Schafer signed into lawMarch 23 a bill mandating North DakotaState University's agricultural experimentstation to \"study the feasibility and desir-ability of industrial hemp production.\" Pro-hemp forces include big business giants likeInternational Paper Co., the world's largestpaper firm, as well as the American FarmBureau. The latter passed a resolution in1996 calling for research into the \"viabilityand economic potential\" of hemp. Locally, both the Minnesota Agri-Growth Council and the Minnesota Farmers Unionsupport hemp growth, as did the Fargo Fo- rum in a March 30 editorial. Chris Leifeld, director of legislative affairs for the farmersunion, has said industrial hemp would haveseveral benefits for farmers.\"It's a good opportunity for our farmers to have access to a new market\" and the cropcould be easily integrated into rotation,Leifeld said. But hemp opponents \u2014 both locally and nationally \u2014 say legalizing hemp growth is astep back in the war on drugs. The federalDrug Enforcement Agency (DEA) lobbiedagainst a 1996 Colorado proposal to autho-rize a hemp pilot project, saying it was impos-sible to distinguish legal from illegal cropswhen doing air searches. While industrialhemp won't produce the \"high\" whensmoked, as marijuana does, doesn'tdistinguish between the two. \"Hemp is acontrolled substance,\" DEA spokesman JamesMcGivney recently told the Washington Post . Likewise, a Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) official opposed in-dustrial hemp at an April 9 House Agricul-ture Committee hearing. \"There are plenty of scoundrels out there who will divert this product into the illegaldrug market,\" said Michael Campion, assis-tant superintendent of the BCA. A memo distributed at the same hearing from Captain B.C. Baker, of the MissouriState Highway Patrol, also cited a \"desensi-tizing of the concerns about the harm ofmarijuana \" in opposing similar legislation.Wisconsin's attorney general has cited simi-lar concerns. Minnesota lawmakers supporting the bill are quick to voice their support of continuedanti-drug efforts. Moe also has said the cropcould do wonders for rural Minnesota. Kahnhas sought to further educate members onthe benefits of hemp \u2014 and the differencesbetween the industrial and high-octane vari-eties. Gov. Arne Carlson, according tospokesman Brian Dietz, has yet to take aposition on the matter. Whether the state allows the commercial farming of hemp, Tari Sullivan, owner ofThe Third Stone, which sells hemp-basedproducts, expects her retail business to con-tinue to grow. Since moving her store fromAlbert Lea to Minneapolis in 1994, the num-ber of hemp products has exploded, she said.Prices aren't necessarily down, she said butavailability is up. Sullivan sells everythingfrom kids clothes to women's business suits.She stocks t-shirts from three United Statesclothing companies that have begun manu-facturing hemp-blends with cotton or rayon.Demand, she said, is increasing. While shehas no immediate plans to open new stores,she has been encouraged by customers to doso. \"My business,\" she said, \"is doing 296-5900Gaming State Clarification Government Funding\"story contained on page 10 of theApril 18, 1997, Session Weekly should have said that HF1389 , sponsored by Rep.

April 18 - 24, 1997 CH39-CH66 Once a bill has passed both the House and the Senate in identical form, it's ready to besent to the governor for consideration. Thegovernor has several options when consid-ering a bill. The governor can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which results in the bill becom- ing law in the first year of the biennium. The timing of these actions is as significantas the actions themselves. In the first year of the biennium, the im-portant thing to remember is that the gover- nor has three days from the time of \"present-ment\" to veto a bill. If the governor doesn'tsign the bill within this time frame, it willbecome law with or without his signature.(Sundays are not counted in the three-daytime limit, but holidays are.) Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to eliminatethe appropriation items to which he objects.As with all vetoes, the governor must includea statement listing the reasons for the vetowith the returned bill. Here, too, the time-table is within three days after the governorreceives the bill.A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. But be-cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 atleast until the next year. The governor's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota Constitution (Article IV,Section 23).

From New York orphan to Civil War general to Minnesota's ninth governor,Hubbard built an impressive list of achieve-ments despite his lowly beginnings. After being raised by his aunt in Chester, Vt., Hubbard was an 18-year-old appren-tice to a tinsmith in Salem, N.Y., when hedecided to head west in 1854. He practiced his trade in Chicago for three years before he picked up and movedagain. This time he landed in Red Wing,Minn. \"The newcomer at once became infected with the hopefulness and enthusiasm thatwas in the air . . .\" Hubbard said in a 1905speech to the Minnesota Historical Society.There was adversity \"but the pioneer isalways hopeful, ever determined, and neverdaunted by obstacles that might discouragethe average man.\" He promptly founded the Red Wing Re-publican , installed himself as editor, and began working to drum up readership. \"The new editor was no printer, but he soon became more or less of an expert in'sticking type,' working the press, and writ-ing boom editorials in exploitation of thelocality,\" Hubbard later said. The paper (which still exists as the Re- publican Eagle ) was a success, but Hubbard left it behind during the Civil War to beginan Army career that saw him rise to therank of general in less than four years. He fought in major Civil War battles at Corinth, Vicksburg, and Nashville, and talesof Hubbard's battlefield exploits includetwice having his horse shot from under-neath him. After the war, Hubbard returned to Min- nesota and started grain and milling busi-ness ventures, and he built two railroadlines in the state. He was elected governor as a Republicanin 1881 and two years later was re-elected for a three-year term. (The three-year termwas necessary to get state elections in tunewith national elections and to begin bien-nial legislative sessions.) Hubbard's tenure as governor was rela- tively unremarkable. The significant ad-vancements attributed to his admin-istration include the creation of the stateRailroad and Warehouse Commission andinitiation of state grading and weighing ofgrain. Perhaps most significantly, the Civil War veteran signed the first state law prohibit-ing racial discrimination in public places. Hubbard, for whom Hubbard County in northern Minnesota was named, re-turned to Red Wing after his second termin office. He was later called on by Presi-dent William McKinley to serve as a briga-dier general in the Spanish-American War. The former governor lived out his final years in St. Paul and Minneapolis, where hedied in 1913 at the age of 77.22 SESSION WEEKLY / April 25, 1997 In the Hopper . . .

A phenomenal amount of food,household goods, and pet supplies were collected because it was a proper thing to do,and it was a way to ease a feeling of helplessness in a hopeless situation. The effort began when two or three people in the State Office Building decided they needed to do something for the stranded Minnesotans devastated by the worst floodin 500 years. With a letter signed by the leaders of both political parties in the Houseand Senate, and flyers and signs asking for food, supplies, and financial donationsplaced all over the complex, the plan brought a flood of donated goods to the collectionpoint in 96 hours! Even the Animal Humane Society of Hennepin County, Pets Plus,and Petfood Outlet called to lend assistance. The Saint Paul Pioneer Press donated two delivery trucks to haul the goods. Early on Saturday, April 26 at the State Office Building, and with little fanfare, scores of volunteers loaded an extraordinary collection of diapers, gloves, bleach, water,ginger ale, sponges, bath soap, washcloths, blankets, toothpaste, squeegees, and manyother items into one truck. Once it was full, they filled a second truck to capacity withpet food and supplies, kitty litter, cat crates, and dog kennels ( See photo, page 11). So, last week, while the lives of Minnesotans at the Capitol were controlled by a session deluged with controversial bills up for debate, political partisans and othersrallied, united, and performed a highly commendable act of honor and duty. With asense of purpose and much heartfelt compassion, their unselfish effort came togetherin spirit and action. The volunteers responded with help for the courageous, yet displaced Minnesotans along the state's flooded areas in and near East Grand Forks as the Red River continuedto flood the valley north toward Canada. Food, supplies, animal shelters and $10,750collected ($6,385 designated for the American Red Cross, and $4,365 for the SalvationArmy) also was shared with people in Ada, Breckenridge, Brown's Valley, Kent andMoorhead \u2014 all victims who live to the south whose towns were devastated earlier inApril by the river. And they gave to residents of cities along the Minnesota River \u2014Ortonville at the headwaters, Granite Falls, Montevideo, and others. A few hundred Minnesotans \u2014 Capitol officials and staff \u2014 once again demon- strated a united effort and responded to the call for making the needs of others far moreimportant than divided political beliefs. \u2014 LeClair G.

Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud), would require uniform,statewide testing of third, fifth, and eighthgraders beginning in the 1997-1998 schoolyear and eleventh graders beginning no laterthan the 1999-2000 school year. Opatz said the tests would be an integral part of the state's move toward an educationsystem that demands schools and studentsbe more accountable for the taxpayer fundsinvested in education. \"What we need to do is to tell schools what we expect, give them the resources they need,and \u2014 with these tests \u2014 measure theirperformance,\" Opatz said. \"Right now, wedon't know [how schools are performing].\" Statewide testing had been a controversial issue at the Capitol in years past, but this yearit drew bipartisan support. Such testing istouted as a way to provide a reliable meansfor comparing the performance of schoolsand districts. The move toward establishing a statewide testing system took a great leap forward early in the 1997 Legislative Session when Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe (DFL-Erskine)successfully moved to attach a requirementfor such testing to a separate bill. Moe's action led to an agreement between legislative leaders to lift the statutory ban onstatewide testing and instead institute suchtesting during the 1997-1998 school year.The pact was included in the first new lawproduced during the 1997 Legislative Ses-sion. (See story, page 6.)Educating students . . . Statewide testing: accountability for schools, kids A special House-Senate committee was then created to devise a more specific plan toimplement statewide testing. Opatz's bill isthe House version of the plan recommendedby the special committee. Under the bill, the basic skills tests in reading and math \u2014 already required underthe state's graduation rule and first given tostudents in the eighth grade \u2014 would count as the statewide test for that age group. Third and Fifth graders would be given tests selected by the Department of Chil-dren, Families and Learning. The depart-ment could use a test it has developed or anationally recognized test such as the Cali-fornia Achievement Test or the Iowa Test ofBasic Skills. Any test used for the statewidetesting system would have to fit in with thestate's graduation standards. Opatz said his bill is not intended to be\"overly prescriptive\" about how the testing system will work. Instead, the Departmentof Children, Families and Learning will begiven the authority to determine which testswould be given and at what time during theschool year. One of the dicey issues in the statewide testing debate concerns who would be testedand who would not. Opatz's bill would allowonly narrow exceptions to the testing re-quirements. For example, students who arenew to the United States and are not profi-cient in English would be exempt. Another key provision in the bill would require that 1997-1998 test results from eachindividual school and each district be usedto establish a baseline against which theirfuture performance could be measured. \"This sets the stage for a more sophisti- cated system of accountability that relates toperformance incentives for schools,\" Opatzsaid. \"You can't do that efficiently until youset a baseline for each school, and that's whatthese tests would do.\" Opatz said he eventually hopes to see a state aid system that rewards schools thatimprove from their baseline levels and tar-gets assistance for struggling schools.\u2014 By Nick Healy \"This sets the stage for a more sophisticated system of accountability that relates to performance incentives for schools. You can't do that efficiently until you set a baseline for each school, and that's what these tests would do.\" \u2014 Rep. Joe OpatzStudents like these third graders from Jackson Elementary School in St. Paul soon may be required to takea statewide achievement test. A bill moving through the House would require uniform, statewide testingof third, fifth, and eighth graders beginning in the 1997-1998 school year and eleventh graders beginningno later than the 1999-2000 school year.4 SESSION WEEKLY / May 2, 1997The bill, approved by 109-23 margin, is headed for a conference committee. The Sen-ate passed a statewide testing bill April 30that is very similar to the House bill but doesnot include a testing requirement for 11thgraders. \"If you don't include the 11th grade, you're removing from this testing system an entiresegment of education \u2014 namely highschool,\" Opatz said. The push for statewide testing this year has received strong support from Gov. ArneCarlson's administration and from lawmak-ers on both sides of the aisle. Bob Wedl, commissioner of the Depart- ment of Children, Families and Learning,who sat on the special committee created tocraft statewide testing legislation, said he issatisfied with the \"broad policy\" for state-wide testing included in the legislation ap-proved by the House. \"We've had no comparable statewide in- formation,\" Wedl said. \"We felt [statewidetesting] was really crucial to being able tounderstand how Minnesota as a whole isdoing.\" Rep. LeRoy Koppendrayer (R-Princeton), a long-time advocate of statewide testing,links the newfound consensus on the issue topress reports related to the performance ofpublic schools and the need for reliable mea-surements of student learning. \"The key is to make sure no kid graduates from high school who doesn't have at leastminimum competency in reading and math,\"Koppendrayer said. AGRICULTURE CHILDRENMilk prices slashed Minnesota grocers would be allowed to sell milk at lower prices under a bill ap-proved April 29 by the House Ways andMeans Committee. HF1646 , sponsored by Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul), would temporarily lift cur-rent law forbidding retailers to sell milk forless than they paid for it. The change in milkpricing policy would be in effect for one year. \"It's an attempt to free up the market,\" Trimble said. The change should bring lowerprices for consumers and may help farmersby driving up demand for dairy products, headded. Trimble and other supporters of the bill argue that the current law has helped tocreate hardships for dairy farmers and con-sumers in the state. Minnesota's dairy farm-ers have seen the prices they get for theirproduct drop significantly in recent months, but the state's consumers continue to paysome of the nation's highest retail milk prices. \"That's what we're trying to deal with here,\" Trimble said. \"We're trying to bringthe free market to bear.\" The one-year change in retail pricing regu- lation would allow lawmakers to assess thesituation during the 1998 session. If the Leg-islature takes no action at that time, existinglaw setting a floor for retail milk prices wouldthen be in effect. Critics of the bill argue that it would lead only to instability in the milk market andcould wind up hurting small grocers anddairy farmers. The Ways and Means Committee rejected an amendment to extend the period duringwhich lower milk prices would be allowedand another to make the change permanent. Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) offered the amendment to allow lower milk prices to beallowed for two years. She argued that thenew pricing policy would not be in effectlong enough before the 1998 Legislative Ses-sion for lawmakers to make a solid judgmentabout whether it should be extended. But Rep. Carol Molnau (R-Chaska) said extending the no-minimum pricing policycould hurt small, independent grocers whocannot afford to get into a price wars withlarge, chain-store competitors. \"Pushing it out for two years will be long enough to make sure [small grocers] go outof business,\" Molnau said. Kahn's amendment was rejected by a mar- gin of 12-9. An amendment proposed byRep. Phil Krinkie (R-Shoreview) that wouldhave made the pricing policy change perma-nent was rejected on a voice vote. Trimble's bill now goes to the House floor. Open court for abused kids The House passed a bill April 29 that would open to the public court cases involv-ing abused or neglected children. The votewas 84-49. Under current law, all juvenile court pro- ceedings and records are closed. HF254 would open the doors and paper work forcases involving Children in Need of Protec-tive Services (CHIPS). The bill would notapply to juvenile delinquency proceedings. Arguments for and against keeping the CHIPS hearings closed centered on protect-ing children. \"We need to open the proceedings so thatthose who care about these kids can see what goes on,\" said bill sponsor Rep. Wes Skoglund(DFL-Mpls). Later he added that scrutinyoften comes too late. \"Why do we wait untilthey're dead?\" Skoglund was part of a team that went on a fact-finding mission to Michigan, whereall juvenile proceedings are open. \"Every lastperson told me that the system was im-proved when it was opened up. The lot in lifeof many poor, neglected, and abused kidsgot better.\" Skoglund said that allowing courtroom access to organizations who care about chil-dren, as well as watchdog organizations likethe press, will increase accountability andserve children's best interests. \"Right nowgrandma, foster parents, aunts, and siblings,are locked out. This causes great harm tokids.\" Detractors said that open hearings would subject children to additional suffering. \"Inrural areas especially [where there is lessanonymity], press coverage and public scru-tiny in the courtroom could be incrediblyshaming, humiliating, and embarrassing tofamilies,\" said Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul). Bill supporters have said they aredepending on the press to not disclosechildren's names, similar to the policy itmaintains regarding rape victims Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey) said there are other ways to reform the system. \"If thereare problems we should solve them by look-ing at the system, not opening it up,\" he said,adding that it was risky to depend on thepress to be responsible. Bill supporters pointed out that many cases involving the neglect or abuse of children areopen to the public already because they in-volve the criminal activity of an adult. \"Butwhat happens if the county wants to send achild back with a dangerous offender?\"Skoglund asked. \"It's happened in this state,I hate to tell you. That's when you want[others] to get through that locked door.\" As it was first presented on the floor, the bill would have opened only CHIPS cases inHennepin County, which accounts for about40 percent of the children in the state, ac-cording to Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls). Jefferson submitted an amendmentto open CHIPS cases statewide, which passedin a 69-64 vote. Supporters also noted that judges would have the same authority to close hearings (attheir discretion) as they do in cases regard-ing other areas of law. \"Right now we're protecting the system, not the children we supposedly care so muchabout,\" said Rep. Barbara Sykora (R-Excel-5 May 2, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYCRIMEsior). \"If the system isn't working, it's high time we knew it.\" Crime bill clears floor The House passed a sweeping omnibus crime-prevention bill April 25 on a 126-5vote. The $990 million proposal funds thestate's court and correctional systems; lawenforcement and public safety agencies; anddepartments such as the attorney general'soffice and its human rights division. Under changes that took place on the floor: A provision to allow pharmacists to sell hypodermic needles and syringes withouta prescription was amended to require thatpurchasers turn in an equal number ofused needles before buying new ones. Theprogram is intended to decrease the spreadof HIV among drug users. The needle ex-change element is to reduce the incidenceof needle litter in public areas. People who interfere with facilities that are involved in selling or providing servicesfor animals or use animals for researchwould be subject to prosecution under thestate's anti-harassment and stalking laws. A provision that would have given prosecu- tors the right to rebut any statement madein the defense's final argument during acriminal trial was changed so that prosecu-tors can only respond to inflammatorystatements or misstatements of fact or law.(The Senate version of the proposal wouldallow prosecutors the last word, regardlessof what the defense says.) Additionally, a prolonged debate to adopt the death penalty for first-degree murderwas defeated on a 102-30 vote. HF163/SF1880* , sponsored in the House by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown),also includes a provision to give judges araise. Caseloads for probation officers alsowould be reduced. Counties could imple-ment drug courts; women leaving prostitu-tion would get help; and funds would besupplied to community advocacy groupshelping battered women. The state wouldpay the overtime costs for police in highcrime areas. The Department of Corrections would be expected to reduce the daily (per diem) costof housing prisoners. Layoffs would bepossible. Low income families would have easier access to representation in court matters, aswould low-income farmers. Courts alsowould be given money to launch a pilotprogram to improve the resolution of familymatters. The program would assign one judge to hear domestic abuse, probate, and juve-nile and delinquency matters within a singlefamily. Dozens of other initiatives also would be funded. A House-Senate conference com-mittee will negotiate a final version of the billto be voted on later this session. (See April 25, 1997, Session Weekly , page 5.) Lt. John Fritsche of the New Ulm Battery fired a reproduction of an artillery cannon as part of the third annual Freedom Day celebration held on the Capitol mall May 1. The event re-enactsCivil War battles.Big bangHarassing, stalking, sentencing A bill to strengthen the state's anti-stalk- ing law and toughen penalties for those vio-lating orders for protection and restrainingorders passed the House April 28. The votewas 125-7. House-Senate conferees agreed to define harassing or stalking behavior as intentionalconduct that the offender knows or has rea-son to know would cause the victim to feelfrightened, threatened, oppressed, perse-cuted, or intimidated. Importantly, the billstates that prosecutors would not be requiredto prove that the offender intended to causethose reactions in the victim, only that theoffender knew or should have known thatthe conduct would cause the reactions andthat the victim did, in fact, experience them.In the event a dangerous weapon is used during a harassment or stalking violation, the offense would be punished by a manda-tory minimum sentence. (If the weapon is afirearm, a three-year penalty applies for thefirst offense, and a five-year penalty appliesto subsequent offenses; if the dangerousweapon is not a firearm, a one-year penaltyapplies to the first offense, and a three-yearpenalty applies to subsequent offenses.) The changes were necessary given a recent Minnesota Supreme Court ruling that weak-ened the current stalking law.Similar anti-stalking language is included in the omnibus crime-prevention bill passedby the House on April 25. (See April 25,1997, Session Weekly, page 5) HF5 , sponsored by Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights), also would createfelony penalties for violating an order forprotection or a harassment restraining orderunder certain circumstances. Such caseswould include violations occurring withinfive years after sentencing from two or moreprevious protection orders or a restrainingorder violation, or if the offender possesseda dangerous weapon during the offense. Other violations of restraining orders would draw the felony penalty if the act ismotivated by race, religion, sex, sexual ori-entation, disability, age, or national origin; ifthe offender intends to interfere with a judi-cial proceeding or retaliate against an officialinvolved in a case; if the victim is a minor andthe offender is at least three years older; or ifthe offender falsely impersonates another. Under the bill, offenders could be sen- tenced to a maximum of five years in prisonand a $10,000 fine. A minimum of 30 days injail (and counseling) would be mandated fora felony protection order violation in caseswhere the court stays the sentence as a con-dition of probation. Finally, the bill would affect current law regarding how judges sentence criminals,stating that an offender may not waive theright to be sentenced under the state's sen-tencing guidelines. The measure is a result ofthe Minnesota Supreme Court's ruling inState v. Givens and is intended to promote consistency and predictability in sentencing. In the Givens case, the defendant agreed to accept probation instead of incarcerationfor a purse-snatching offense. However,under the conditions of the agreement, if he6 SESSION WEEKLY / May 2, 1997violated probation, he would serve double the jail time recommended under the guide-lines. The offender later did violate proba-tion, but appealed the sentence. The bill would make it clear that while the guidelines are advisory to the courts, theyare not rights that a defendant can waive. The bill also states that if a defendant agrees to be sentenced outside the guide-lines, he or she may not appeal the sentenceafter 90 days or after committing anothercrime, whichever is first. HF5 now goes to the governor. EDUCATIONSCHOOL Spending caps removed The first new law produced dur- ing the 1997 session removedstatutory caps on educationspending and requires uniformstatewide testing of public schoolstudents. The law lifted a provision approved by lawmakers in 1995 that called for a $337million cut in state aid to school districtsduring the next two years. Considered a top priority at the start of the legislative session, the proposal to removethe spending caps won broad, bipartisansupport. Statewide testing was initially linked to the spending caps proposal through anamendment approved on the Senate floor.The legislation that the House originallypassed did not include any such language. The eventual result was legislation to do three things: repeal the caps on educationfunding, repeal current law prohibiting state-wide testing, and establish that Minnesotawill require standardized testing of allstudents. Supporters of statewide testing tout it as a way to increase accountability in publicschools by providing a reliable measurementof student and school performance that canbe compared to results from other schoolsand districts. The specifics on how statewide testing will work are not included in the new law. Aspecial House-Senate committee was cre-ated to devise separate legislation ( HF2179 ) prescribing how statewide testing is to beimplemented. (See related story, page 3.) The repeal of the funding caps was effec- tive Feb. 15. Statewide testing will be requiredbeginning in the 1997-1998 school year. The legislation was sponsored by Rep. AliceSigned by the governor Signed by the governorJohnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park) and Sen.Keith Langseth (DFL-Glyndon). HF1*/SF3/CH1 Relays added to mercury law A bill regulating mercury-con-taining products was signed byGov. Arne Carlson April 28. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cause permanent ner-vous system damage. Since mer- cury is a volatile element, it does not degradein the environment, but becomes airborneand eventually returns to earth to contami-nate watersheds. It also accumulates in ani-mal tissue as it moves up the food chain.Consumption of fish from 90 percent ofMinnesota's lakes is currently restricted be-cause of mercury contamination. The law, sponsored in the House by Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls), adds commer-cial electrical relays to a list of products fromwhich mercury must be removed for reuseor recycling prior to disposal. The new re-striction takes effect July 1, 1998. \"When we originally passed the bill to regulate mercury recycling in products, weleft out electrical relays,\" Wagenius said onthe House floor March 20. \"These relays areshowing up in the waste stream and need tobe included [in the law].\" Regulations currently in effect include such devices as thermostats, thermometers, andswitches. Manufacturers are required to la-bel all mercury containing products andaccept them back for recycling or properdisposal. Sen. Janet Johnson (DFL-North Branch) sponsored the Senate proposal. HF949*/SF885/CH62ENVIRONMENT FAMILYGAME & FISH Signing up for fatherhood A bill to register the names of fathers \u2014 or potential fathers \u2014 with the state was ap-proved April 29 by the House Ways andMeans Committee. HF296 , sponsored by Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls), would require the Departmentof Health to establish a registry for men whowant to be assured notification if their childis put up for adoption. The registry would be for any male who is or may be a child's father but is not marriedto the mother and has not otherwise estab- lished paternity. The registry would protect a birth father's rights in the event his child is put up foradoption, and protect children and adoptiveparents from having their families \"rippedapart,\" Wejcman said. The bill aims to address scenarios where the parents of a child have little or no rela-tionship beyond the time of conception. The bill would allow a father or potential father to register from the time of concep-tion until 60 days after a child's birth. (Aman would be able to register even withoutcertainty that a pregnancy resulted from asexual encounter.) Under the bill, a father who does not register within 60 days of a child's birthwould not \u2014 under most circumstances \u2014be allowed to contest an adoption. Registering also would serve as the first step in a paternity claim. The bill says thatwithin 30 days of registering, the father wouldhave to file with the court an intent to claimparental rights. That way, a father would preserve the right to maintain an interest in the child andwould receive notice of a pending adoptionproceeding. The bill would apply only to parental rights related to adoptions \u2014 not to child support,custody, or other parental issues. HF296 now moves to the House floor. Assistant anglers allowed Anglers who need help wetting their fish- ing lines due to age, blindness, or disabilityare given a break by a bill ( HF311/SF574* ) approved April 29 by the House. The votewas 131-0. Seniors and the disabled currently receive free fishing licenses but those assisting themoften must pay for a separate license. Thebill, sponsored by Rep. Darlene Luther (DFL-Brooklyn Park), would allow aged and dis-abled persons to be assisted by an unlicensedperson as long as only one line is in the water. \"One of my constituents, Mark Jacobson, of Brooklyn Park, brought the problem tomy attention,\" Luther has said. Jacobson'smother is disabled and needs assistance topursue her favorite sport. Since she has sev-eral different assistants, Jacobson found hewould have to pay for a separate fishinglicense for each assistant. The bill now goes to the governor.7 May 2, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYHEALTHGOVERNMENT State-run drug program The House approved a $630 million om- nibus state government finance bill April 24,after members voted to retain a section thatwould put the state in the prescription drugbusiness. The final tally was 75-57. Under SF1905 , sponsored in the House by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia), thecommissioner of the Department of Admin-istration would be required to establish aconsortium to purchase pharmaceuticals inbulk. The drugs would, in turn, be sold topharmacists who would then pass the sav-ings on to consumers. Opponents of the measure argued that it would greatly expand the role of govern-ment and that the issue needed further study. Supporters said the program would re- duce the price of prescription drugs by 10percent and allow some senior citizens toavoid making a choice between buying themedicine they need and eating. The House deleted language in SF1905 that would have thrown a monkey wrenchinto the construction of a new steam plant atthe University of Minnesota, which is cur-rently under way at a site near the banks ofthe Mississippi River. The bill would haveprevented Minneapolis or St. Paul frombuilding a steam plant until the end of the1998 Legislative Session. \"What it would do is effectively delay what is going on right now,\" said Rep. HildaBettermann (R-Brandon), who introducedthe amendment to strike the steam plantsection of the bill. \"Any further delays con-tinue to cost us money.\" The members also adopted an amend- ment offered by Rep. Philip Krinkie (R-Shoreview) that would appropriate $1million for the Minnesota Film Board. Themoney, Krinkie said, would help the boardbring a Hollywood film company to the stateto produce a sequel to \"Twins,\" which starredArnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito. A conference committee will meet soon to resolve differences with the Senate version ofthe bill. (See April 18, 1997, Session Weekly , page 10.)Meetings via interactive TV The House passed a bill April 30 that would authorize state and local officials toconduct meetings via interactive television.The technology is like a telephone confer-ence call with the addition of live video.Meeting participants at different places cantalk to and hear one another through televi-sion. Under the bill ( HF829/SF755* ), spon- sored in House by Rep. Loren Solberg(DFL-Bovey), regular, special, and emer-gency meetings could be held via interactivetechnology. That means House committeemembers, for example, could vote on billswhile in locations other than a legislativecommittee room. The House has used the technology in a limited capacity over the past few years, withlegislators meeting in the State Office Build-ing linking to remote locations around thestate. There is currently one House hearingroom equipped for interactive televisionhearings. The proposal also would apply to other local units of government, such as counties,cities, and school boards. Under the bill, meetings would be open to the public and subject to the same notifica-tion requirements as other meetings. It alsorequires that all participants and observersbe able to see and hear each other. Further, atleast one legislator or member of a localgovernment unit would have to participatefrom the committee's \"home\" location wherethe meeting would normally be held. A successful amendment sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Crookston) would allowmembers of the Rural Finance Agency or theMinnesota Housing Finance Agency to offi-cially meet \u2014 and vote \u2014 by phone. Themove would save time and money, Tunheimsaid, given the diverse geographic represen-tation of those governmental bodies. A conference committee will be appointed to resolve differences in the House and Sen-ate proposals. More MinnesotaCare enrollees Minnesota hospitals and health care pro- viders would see a tax break and more of thestate's poor would become eligible for state-subsidized health insurance, under a billmoving through the House. The measure ( HF1441 ) would expand the state's MinnesotaCare program and at thesame time cut the 2 percent tax on hospitalsand health care providers (used to fund MinnesotaCare) to 1.5 percent. Overall, it is expected to cost about $30 million over the next two years to add morepeople to the insurance plan. The tax cutwould save hospitals and health care provid-ers about $81 million over the same timeperiod. The bill, sponsored by Rep. LeeGreenfield (DFL-Mpls), next goes to theHouse Ways and Means Committee. Currently, the 2 percent tax generates about $323.6 million over two years and thatdoesn't include separate revenue sources suchas premiums and other taxes collected. MinnesotaCare is a state-subsidized in- surance plan created in 1992 to extend healthinsurance to the uninsured. The programserves about 97,000 people who pay premi-ums (based on income) and co-paymentsfor some services. Currently, (depending ontheir income), single people, couples with-out children, and families with childrenyounger than 21 are covered. Specifically, the bill would affect single people and couples without children. Itwould increase the annual income limits ofthose two groups to 175 percent of the fed-eral poverty level, or $13,807 for single peopleand $18,567 for couples without children.The current income limit is 135 percent ofthe federal poverty level or $10,651 and$14,323, respectively. HF1441 also includes a prescription drug program for seniors over age 65 who earnless than $9,468 per year (120 percent of thefederal poverty level). The program would provide coverage, ef- fective Jan. 1, 1998, for certain prescriptiondrugs. Participants would be expected to paypremiums based on their income. To qualify, a senior citizen also must be enrolled in Medicare parts A and B and haveno insurance coverage for prescription drugs. The new program is expected to cost about $3.2 million over the next two years. The bill also sets aside $9 million over the next two years to provide grants and loans torural hospitals to make building improve-ments. The Department of Health wouldhave the authority to award interest-freegrants or loans of up to $1.5 million perhospital.

Beginning January1998, Minnesotans on welfaremust work or lose a chunk oftheir monthly public assistancecheck. After months of debate, Gov. Arne Carlson April 30 signed Minnesota'snew welfare law, a response to a 1996 federalact that scrapped the long-standing welfaresystem and required states to move welfarerecipients to work or face millions of dollarsin federal penalties. Minnesota's passage of the law meets the deadline (July 1, 1997) imposed by the fed-eral government requiring all states to re-port just how they plan to move welfarefamilies to work. Both bodies of the Minnesota Legislature passed a compromise version of the bill April28. The House voted 120-14 and the Senatevoted 67-0. While much of Minnesota's new law fo- cuses on moving welfare families to work,there is a second theme \u2014 softening some ofthe cuts found in the federal law aimed atimmigrants. Under the federal law, legal im-migrants will lose almost all public assis-tance benefits, including food stamps,effective this summer. Minnesota's welfare law ( HF159/SF1*/ CH85 ) will use state dollars to replace some of the cuts, but will leave most immigrantshundreds of dollars short each month com-pared to previous federal benefits. Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) and Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd) spon-sored the bill. Below is a summary of some of the new law's highlights. Immigrants Although the federal law has left legal immigrants with little, some in Minnesotawill be eligible for about $290 a month incash assistance \u2014 $203 per month as part ofGeneral Assistance (GA) and $87 per monthto replace lost food stamps. GA is a state program that offers help to those in poverty who do not qualify for otherstate or federal welfare programs. However,only those legal immigrants living in Minne-sota by March 1, 1997, will qualify for GA.Those who become elderly or disabled whileliving here also could receive GA. (Art. 3,Sec. 34) It is important to note that the $87 a month to replace lost food stamps is tempo- rary. It is only offered from July 1, 1997, toJune 30, 1998. (Art. 3, Sec. 42) In Minnesota,an estimated 16,000 legal immigrants willlose their federal food stamps in 1997. Another 5,400 elderly and disabled immi- grants are expected to lose their federalSupplemental Security Income (SSI). SSIbegan in 1974 and provides about $400 permonth to the needy who are aged, blind, ordisabled. The state's offer of GA will helpreplace that income. In addition to GA, the new law keeps cer- tain legal immigrants eligible for other Min-nesota welfare programs, from MedicalAssistance (a joint state-federal program forthose who can't afford health care) to thestate's new welfare-to-work program knownas the Minnesota Family Investment Pro-gram (MFIP). (Art. 1, Sec. 7 and Art. 3, Sec.19) The measure, however, requires that the income of a legal immigrant's Americansponsor be considered when determiningeligibility for public assistance. This is inkeeping with the federal law. Work for welfare For several years, Minnesota has experi- mented with a welfare pilot program in eightcounties that requires poor families withchildren to work for public assistance. Under the new law, that experiment will become permanent beginning Jan. 1, 1998,and cover all 87 Minnesota counties.(Art. 1, Sec. 1) The Minnesota Family Investment Pro- gram, or MFIP as it is called, allows familiesto accept lower-paying jobs while receivingsome public assistance such as extra monthlycash and subsidized child and health care. Intheory, allowing someone to work while still receiving benefits helps a low-skilled parentgain work experience and eventually obtaina better job. MFIP replaces the traditional Aid to Fami- lies with Dependent Children (AFDC) pro-gram done away with by the 1996 federalwelfare law. And, in keeping with federallaw, Minnesota's law sets a five-year, lifetimelimit on receiving MFIP welfare checks.(Art. 1, Sec. 32) There are some exceptions to the five-year limit, including victims of domestic abusewho need time to find safety before they cansettle into a job. (Art. 1, Sec. 32, Subd. 4) Under MFIP, a parent or guardian is re- quired to develop a job search and employ-ment plan and accept any suitable job oncethey've completed all the steps in their plan.As is the case now, the state will continue topay for employment and job training services. In a two-parent family, at least one parent must find work right away. Single parentfamilies have up to six months to find work.(Art. 1, Sec. 40) Income limits The new law does set income limits on how much a family can earn on the job andstill continue to receive a monthly MFIPcheck. For a family of three, a limit of $1,311 per month is set. A family of three in the currentpilot MFIP program, can earn up to $1,554per month before being cut off. Officialsmaintain the state couldn't afford the higheramount and still take the program statewide.(Art. 1, Sec. 13) Gov. Arne Carlson, center, gestures \"that's it\" after signing a landmark welfare reform law April 30 that requires families on welfare to work. He is surrounded by Lt. Gov. Joanne Benson, right, and legislators and state agency heads.9 May 2, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYPenalties for no work Families who refuse to work or otherwise break the rules will see their grant cut by 10percent for at least a month and until theviolation is corrected. For subsequent occurrences, a county will directly pay a family's rent, and possiblyutilities, out of a grant and cut the remainderby 30 percent before forwarding it to thefamily. (Art. 1, Sec. 36, Subd. 1) Education limits The law also limits the amount of postsecondary education a person may re-ceive while on MFIP. Under the currentAFDC program, some parents are allowed toattend college for four years while still re-ceiving their monthly welfare check, childcare, and health care services. Generally, the measure limits approved postsecondary or training programs to a yearor less but does allow for up to two years if thediploma or degree can be shown to help thewelfare parent earn a better income and he orshe agrees to pay back the cost of the secondyear when they earn 150 percent of the fed-eral poverty level, which is now $11,835 peryear. (Art. 1, Sec. 44, Subd. 1 and 4) New mom exemption Although most welfare recipients would be required to work, the law does allow forcertain exemptions, such as a parent whostays home to care for a child under the age ofone. In two-parent households, only one par-ent could claim the exemption, and then onlyfor 12 months in a lifetime. (Art. 1, Sec. 47) Residency requirement The law mandates a 30-day residency re- quirement to receive welfare and requiresthat, for the first year, families who move toMinnesota receive either the benefit amountthey would have received in their previousstate, or Minnesota's rate, whichever is less.(Art. 1, Sec. 8, Subd. 1a and 3; and Art. 3,Sec. 27)) Penalties split The federal welfare law puts a great deal of pressure on states to move people off thewelfare rolls or lose money. It is unclear,however, if the state plans to share that pres-sure with counties, which operate most wel-fare programs. Beginning with fiscal year 1997, each state must show that 25 percent of its families onwelfare are working at least 20 hours perweek. By fiscal year 2002, that jumps to 50percent working at least 30 hours per week.There are cash penalties for states that do notmeet the percentages.At one point a legislative proposal would have forced counties to share in the federalpenalty. But the new law takes a softer ap-proach. Instead, it requires the Departmentof Human Services and counties to worktogether to develop a plan on how to pay afederal penalty. They must report their con-clusions to the Legislature by Oct. 1, 1998.(Art. 1, Sec. 63) Drug offenses Anyone convicted of a felony drug offense after July 1, 1997, will be barred from partici-pating in MFIP until they complete theirsentence. When and if they qualify for amonthly check, the law requires counties topay rent and utilities first before mailing outthe balance. Random drug testing also isrequired. (Art. 1, Sec. 16, Subd. 1) Those convicted of a drug felony after July 1, 1997, will be barred from receiving $203per month under GA for five years after theycompleted their sentence. That is, unless theperson is in treatment or on a waiting list fortreatment. (Art. 3, Sec. 28) Parole violators and felons on the run will face a lifetime ban for both MFIP and GA.(Art. 1, Sec. 16, Subd. 2 and 3; and Art. 3, Sec.28, Subd. 2) Those convicted of fraudulentlyattempting to receive benefits in two or morestates at one time will be barred from bothMFIP and GA for 10 years. (Art. 1, Sec. 16,Subd. 4 and Art. 3, Sec. 28, Subd. 4) HF159/SF1*/CH85 Omnibus bill passes House A $5.4 billion bill that pays for state health and social service programs passed the HouseApril 28 but not before lawmakers under-went a lengthy debate about same-sex mar-riages. The bill passed The measure ( SF1908 ) includes a hodge- podge of projects and policy changes but fewdrew debate like the one that prohibits mar-riages between people of the same gender. Italso prohibits the recognition of such mar-riages in Minnesota even if the marriageoccurred in a state where they are sanc-tioned. Rep. Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), a sup- porter of the provision, introduced anamendment to delete it. His strategy was toforce a debate and a public vote on the issue.Lawmakers voted 105-24 to keep the provi-sion. The proposal responds to the possibility that Hawaii may recognize same-sex mar-riages and would affect people who mightmove to Minnesota from that state. Hawaiihad passed a law prohibiting same sex mar-riages, but a lower court ruled the law un- constitutional. The state has appealed to itsstate Supreme Court. Before passing the bill, the House added several provisions. One would revise thestate's physician abortion-reporting form toinclude the specific reason why each motherseeks an abortion. Another would shift $1.2million from family planning services andspend it on programs to teach teens aboutabstinence. Still another would spend $30million over the next two years to increasethe pay of people who work with seniors andpeople with disabilities in community-basedprograms. The omnibus health and human services bill provides money for all sorts of programsranging from welfare and nursing homes torestaurant inspections and clean needle pro-grams for addicts. A large chunk of the bill's price tag \u2014 $1.8 billion \u2014 would pay to cover the health careneeds of poor Minnesotans under two sepa-rate grant programs: Medical Assistance andGeneral Assistance Medical Care. Another $2.7 billion would pay for certain nursing home, disability, mental health,group housing, chemical dependency, andother long term care services. About $432 million would fund state wel- fare grants. Minnesota's welfare programwas overhauled this session after the federalgovernment scrapped the old system, cutbenefits to legal immigrants, and requiredwelfare recipients to work. SF1908 now sits in a conference commit- tee where differences between the House andSenate versions of the bill will be worked out. INSURANCEINSURANCE Direct OB/GYN access A new state law will forbid healthinsurers from requiring womento receive a referral in order to seean obstetrician or a gynecologist. The law, effective Jan. 1, 1998, will require that insurance com- panies and health maintenance organiza-tions allow female enrollees direct access toobstetricians and gynecologists. Under the law, women will be allowed to schedule an appointment with either healthprofessional without prior approval fromthe insurer or a referral from a \"gatekeeper\"primary care physician. The law will require direct access for an- nual examinations, any subsequent treat-ment deemed necessary by the specialist,Signed by the governor10 SESSION WEEKLY / May 2, 1997maternity care, and treatment of acute or emergency conditions. Health plans also will be barred from charging women extra for direct access. The legislation was sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown) and Sen.Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan). Gov. ArneCarlson signed the measure into law April 8. HF447*/SF398/CH26 LAW Signed by the governorInmate lawsuits A new law will clarify when aprisoner may appeal a ruling thata lawsuit was frivolous or mali-cious. Some prisoners, after having a lawsuit thrown out in court, have attempted to have the case \"retried\" throughcorrections department processes, accord-ing to Rep. Tom Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul),the bill's House sponsor. Effective Aug. 1,the new law states that inmates do not havea right to an additional hearing within thecorrectional facility's disciplinary systemregarding such a finding, and that the cor-rections department must uphold the court'sruling. Existing law provides penalties for filing the suits. Once the court has judged that aninmate's suit lacks merit, corrections offi-cials may determine and impose the appro-priate penalty, which may mean the loss ofprivileges, segregation, loss of credit for goodbehavior, or additional confinement.The billstates that the officials must limit punish-ment to that specified in the law and are\"limited to the nature and extent of theinfraction penalty to be imposed.\" The law's Senate sponsor is Sen. Jane Krentz (DFL-May Township). HF909/SF305*/CH33 LOCAL GOVERNMENTMILITARY Signed by the governor Five-year-old Tessa Farrell peeks over the top of the desk chair of her father, Rep. Jim Farrell,while spending some time on the House floor April 29.A little peek Saving Roseville tax dollars A new law will save the city ofRoseville some of its citizens'hard-earned tax dollars. It wassigned by Gov. Arne CarlsonApril 23. For a variety of reasons, cities, townships, and counties must publish legalnotices in local newspapers. The advertise-ments serve as public notice for land sales,class action lawsuits, and other governmentactions.Under current law, local governments can publish such notices only in newspaperswhose primary offices are within their juris-diction. But that limitation can cost local govern- ments more than necessary when nearbynewspapers charge substantially less for adspace. Sponsored in the House by Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), the law will allowthe city of Roseville and Independent SchoolDistrict No. 623 to officially designate anynewspaper with at least 25 percent of itscirculation within the Roseville city limits orwithin the boundaries of the school district. A letter from the Roseville City Council to the House Local Government and Metro-politan Affairs Committee detailed the prob-lem that city has faced. \"The council designated the Roseville Re- view as the official newspaper for 1996, based on substantially lower cost.\" But the letter ofthe law required the city to select the Roseville Focus, based on the paper's office location. The restriction caused Roseville to pay ap-proximately 75 percent more, an extra$4,500, for legal notices in 1996. Originally, the proposal was drafted to apply to all local governments in Minnesotabut was restricted to the city of Roseville byan amendment in the Senate. According toGreiling, the Minnesota Newspaper Asso-ciation feared that the law might be used bysome local officials to retaliate against news-papers that disagreed with their governmen-tal actions. Another Senate amendment protects lo- cal officials if errors occur in the publicationof public notices. The law takes effect upon approval of the Roseville City Council. Sen. John Marty (DFL-Roseville) spon- sored the bill in the Senate. HF356*/SF284/CH56 Enlist and enroll A bill that increases the amount of maxi- mum grant-aid to cover educational costsfor Minnesota National Guard memberspassed the House April 30 on a 133-0 vote. HF297/SF4* , sponsored in the House by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), wouldcover up to 50 percent of tuition and text-book costs at any Minnesota public institu-tion of higher education. For programsoutside of Minnesota, the grants would coverthe equivalent of half the cost of a compa-rable program at the University ofMinnesota. Currently, the tuition grant program cov- ers the equivalent of up to 75 percent of thecost of undergraduate programs at the Uni-versity of Minnesota or the same amount atanother school. But because graduate pro-grams often cost considerably more, theguard was having trouble enrolling mem-bers in programs such as medical school thatit deemed necessary or beneficial to the or-ganization. Bill sponsors have said that theprovision is necessary to keep the guard at-tractive to potential members.11 May 2, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYOUTSTATE TAXES $The national guard can target specific pro- grams and students for grant aid. The changewill not cost the guard any additional funds. A conference committee will adopt a final version of the bill. (See April 18, 1997, Session Weekly, page 14.) State flood relief The House passed a bill April 30 that would provide $21 million in relief for vic-tims of the flooding throughout Minnesota,but many lawmakers said the Legislature willeventually have to do more. The bill ( HF2129/SF1894* ), sponsored by Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison),would draw funds from the state's $522 mil-lion budget reserve and would temporarilylift some bureaucratic regulations to easerelief efforts. \"I think this is a message to the people of Minnesota and the people who are affected[by the flood] beyond our imagination,\"Peterson said. His bill passed 133-0. The bill would send $20 million to the Department of Public Safety for distributionto counties, cities, and towns affected by theflood. The money could be used for costsassociated with flooding, including their useas matching funds to receive federal emer-gency relief aid. Another $1 million would be earmarked to help state agencies deal with expensesrelated to flood relief efforts. A variety of state agency rules and fees would be waived to speed flood relief efforts.For example, a business owner would not berequired to pay fees for any state inspectionsthat may be necessary to get his or her busi-ness up and running again. The bill also would provide an adjustment in state aid to help school districts affectedby the flood. Flood relief funding included in the bill would be added to the $3 million for floodcosts that was part of a $20 million emer-gency snow removal costs bill passed earlierthis session and signed into law ( HF100*/ SF114/CH12 ). (See Jan. 24, 1997, Session Weekly, page 5; March 14, 1997, Session Weekly, page 12; March 28, 1997, Session Weekly, page 9.) It's still unclear what the total price tag will be to clean up and repair the manyhomes, businesses, and schools damaged bythe disastrous flooding this spring along theMinnesota and Red rivers. President Clinton vowed to deliver $488million in federal aid when he visited the hard-hit Red River Valley in April, but somenow say that amount may fall well short. Earlier this week, Peterson said the dam- age to housing and infrastructure in Minne-sota likely will exceed $800 million. And apreliminary Federal Reserve Bank estimateof total property damage in the Red RiverValley (including the hard-hit cities of EastGrand Forks, Minn. and Grand Forks, N.D.)offered a figure of $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion. \"This is not going to be done for a long time yet,\" Peterson said. Several other lawmakers whose districts include areas hit by flooding echoedPeterson's remarks. \"This is the first step, and it's going to be the first step in a long process of makingthese people whole,\" said Rep. Kevin Goodno(R-Moorhead). Rep. Tim Finseth (R-Angus) said state lawmakers will have to continue to work ongetting needed relief to flood victims. Capitol relief\"This is not going to be the only bill relat- ing to the flood this year,\" Finseth said. \"Thisis not enough. We will have to do more.\" In the meantime, a separate bill (not yet assigned a House File number) that wouldput a moratorium on loan foreclosures forflood victims is advancing in the House. The measure, sponsored by Rep. Irv Anderson (DFL-Int'l Falls), would allowpeople who have had their homes, business,or property damaged by flooding to avoidforeclosure on mortgages, car loans, andother types of loans. Also this week, Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL- Bovey), who chairs the House Ways andMeans Committee, announced the creationof an 18-member task force headed byPeterson to coordinate flood relief efforts inthe Legislature. The task force is expected to tour flood- damaged communities around the state andto hold hearings on relief proposals. The bill now goes to the governor. Cabin tax break The House of Representatives approved its 1997 omnibus tax bill April 25, setting thestage for comprehensive property tax andeducation finance reform. \"This bill fulfills our obligation to reform\" the system, Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls), whochairs the House Taxes Committee, said ofHF2163 , which passed on a 101-32 vote. \"There are major relief elements . . . andthere are also major reform elements.\" Indeed, HF2163 reduces the tax rates for many of the state's property tax classifica-tions, compresses the tax rate structure, andrequires the state to assume a greater share ofthe education finance responsibility. It alsomodifies the state's sales and income taxcodes, and contains new restrictions forMinnesota's Tax Increment Finance districts. Before passing HF2163 , members stripped the bill of a measure designed to protecttaxpayers from the increased local levies thatsome say could result from changing theeducation funding mechanism. By a vote of78-53, members adopted an amendment byRep. Ted Winter (DFL-Fulda) that removedthe so-called \"reverse referendum\" provi-sion. Under the reverse referendum process, any new tax \u2014 over the amount specified bythe bill's levy limits \u2014 imposed by localofficials would be subject to voter approval if State staff, officials, and legislative lobbyistsfilled two trucks with cleaning and pet suppliesfor the victims of Minnesota's floods. Theyalso raised $10,750 for the Red Cross andSalvation Army. Highlights continued on page 1712 SESSION WEEKLY / May 2, 1997 Lawmakers once again heard from propo- nents of several ideas, some old, some new, forbuilding and funding an outdoor ballpark forthe Minnesota Twins. State support for a newstadium was the subject of a joint meeting of theHouse and Senate tax committees April 30. Novotes were taken on any of the proposals. The April 30 informational meeting was co- chaired by tax committee chairs Sen. DougJohnson (DFL-Tower) and Rep. Dee Long (DFL-Mpls). \"The public has debated this issue for the past year,\" Rest told the panel as she presented thelatest version of her bill. \"It is very clear that a newballpark is not anyone's top priority, but preserv-ing major league baseball in Minnesota is.\" Now on the table and drawing the increasing support of lawmakers and the ire of tribalrepesentatives is a proposed casino on thegrounds of the struggling horse racing facility,Canterbury Park in Shakopee. Rep. MarkHolsten (R-Stillwater) and Sen. Dick Day (R-Owatonna) have proposed the state-run casinoas a revenue source to pay for a new stadium. Their bill ( HF1300/SF492 ) would authorize the Minnesota State Lottery to place 1,500 videoslot machines in a new facility at the racetrack,just a few miles from the most successful In-dian-run casino in the state, Mystic Lake. Fortypercent of the new gambling revenue would bededicated to the Environmental Trust Fund,Holsten said. Another 2 percent would go tofund urban American Indian programs. But theremainder of the money could be used for what-ever purpose the Legislature deems necessary,including a new ballpark, Holsten said. \"The citizens of Minnesota love to gamble,\" Holsten said in response to those who are op-posed to the idea. \"You can't go anywhere in thestate and not gamble.\" \"The main thing we want to stress is that this doesn't involve one dime of tax money,\" saidDay. This idea is widely opposed by leaders of Minnesota's 11 American Indian reservations whoVideo gambling on table to fund new Twins stadium now have a monopoly on casino gaming inthe state. (See related story on page 16 .) Twins owner, Carl Pohlad, wants the state to help him secure the new ballparkto help turn around the team's ailing fi-nancial picture. He says that without anew stadium he may be forced to sell theteam outside the state. Gov. Arne Carlsonsupports Pohlad's request. But publicopinion polls have consistently shown that,though Minnesotans want to keep theTwins, they don't want a new stadiumbuilt with tax dollars. Major League Baseball's Acting Com- missioner Bud Selig said without a newstadium, the Twins will leave. \"There isn't a doubt in my mind that a new stadium built the proper way, thatproduced the kind of revenue that I knowCarl and Jerry and everybody wants, willkeep this club competitive . . . But withoutit, they have no team,\" he said. Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) is the House sponsor of the bill ( HF1367 ) now before the House Taxes Committee.It would authorize the Metropolitan SportsFacilities Commission or a similar entityto design and build a $439 million retractableroof ballpark for the Twins in Minneapolis. Build-ing the ballpark would be contingent on theTwins signing a 30-year lease and advanced saleof a substantial number of private boxes, clubseats, permanent seat licenses and season tickets. Rest is proposing an amendment requiring Pohlad to donate $15 million toward construc-tion costs and invest another $35 million to bepaid back with revenues from naming rights andconcessions contracts. The bill currently requiresthat Pohlad donate $50 million, a provision hefinds unacceptable. In exchange for the state's investment in the ballpark, Pohlad has offered, and the bill re-quires, that 49 percent of the team's ownershipand net operating profits go to the MetropolitanSports Facilities Commission. This would needto be approved by Major League Baseball. Rest's bill pays for the stadium with taxes from \"There isn't a doubt in my mind that a new sta d and everybody wants, will keep this club comp e a special tax district; a 4 percent surcharge onplayer earnings; a $1 per vehicle parking taxaround the stadium; a $1 ticket surcharge; a 9percent sales tax within the stadium; a 10 per-cent wholesale tax on sports memorabilia; anda special state lottery game. If the bill falls short of the $37.9 million needed yearly to pay for the stadium, Rest toldthe committee that she would not object toadding a cigarette tax increase. Carlson's origi-nal deal with the Twins called for a 10-cents perpack cigarette tax to pay for the stadium. Thatprovision was deleted from subsequent ver-sions of the bill. Some lawmakers have other ideas for how to make up the funding deficit. The most frequentlydiscussed option has been the use of gamblingrevenue. Carlson has indicated that he wouldnot be opposed to gambling as a source of sta-dium revenue. Rest has been more circumspectbut has not closed off the gambling option.Several proposals aired at joint House-Senate tax hearing \u2014 By Steve Compton13 May 2, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYOther ballpark options There is no shortage of ideas floating around the Legislature on how to address the MinnesotaTwins' request for a new outdoor ballpark. Theyall got a hearing before a joint meeting of theHouse and Senate tax committees April 30. Theproposals include the following: HF936/SF1323 : \"We are being told we only have two choices, either build the stadium or theTwins leave,\" said Sen. Ellen Anderson (DFL-St.Paul). Anderson and Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) have sponsored a bill that offers a third option:buying the Twins. The bill would appropriate$100 million in state funds to purchase the teamfrom the Pohlads and resell it to the public. ThePohlads would be asked to continue operatingthe team for the state. HF1962/SF1727 : Sponsored by Sen. Ed Oliver (R-Minnetonka) and Rep. Barb Sykora (R-Excel-An amendment to HF1367 offered by Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul) mirrorsthe Holsten/Day proposal in nearly everyway except location. \"The best site for a state run gambling facility is on land we already own inBloomington next to the Mall of America,\"Milbert said. Such a facility would bring in $100 million per year, he said. This proposal is strongly opposed by Bloomington city officials and legislators,said Sen. William Belanger (R-Bloomington). Rep. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth) also proposes putting slot machines at Canter-bury Park, but the goal would be only to raiseenough revenue to purchase Twins ticketsand void the escape clause in the Twins' leasethat allows them to leave the Metrodomeafter the 1998 season. The Twins have lost money the last two seasons and the escape clause activates ifoperating losses continue this season. TheTwins are projecting that will be the case.Van Dellen said that buying the tickets wouldprevent the team from moving. The ticketswould be donated to charitable organiza-tions. Both the House and Senate tax commit- tees are expected to take up the stadium billsseparately next week. sior), this bill calls for the Pohlads, other privatesector investors, and the Metropolitan Sports Fa-cilities Commission to each invest $80 million inthe new stadium. The city of Minneapolis wouldprovide $30 million to purchase and prepare landfor the ballpark. The commission would pay for its investment with state revenues from an existing tax on sports,health, athletic, and country club memberships.Additional revenues would come from a tickettax, rent on the stadium, and sale of naming rightson the facility. The Twins would retain all otherstadium-related revenue. HF107 : House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) proposes to have the MetropolitanSports Facilities Commission sell off its Met Cen-ter property, use the proceeds to pay off theremaining debt on the Metrodome, and sell thedome for $1 to its current occupants, the Twinsand the Vikings. The Metropolitan Sports Facili-ties Commission would be disbanded. Marty proposal Sen. John Marty (DFL-Roseville) proposes to finance the stadium by selling revenuebonds to private investors. The bonds wouldthen be paid off with projected revenue in-creases generated by the new stadium. Sur-plus revenues would be turned over to theTwins as profit. According to an economic analysis by David Welle for the Metropolitan Sports FacilitiesCommission, the new stadium would collect$99.1 million in its first year of operation in2001. Under Marty's plan, the Twins would get$47.9 million off the top (their current annualrevenue, adjusted for inflation). Debt paymenton the ballpark would get the next $37.9 mil-lion. The remaining surplus revenue of $13.2million also would go to the Twins. The Pohlads would retain 100 percent own- ership of the team under Marty's plan and thetaxpayers would not be put at risk. dium built the proper way, that produced the kind of revenue that I know Carl and Jerry etitive . . .

Selig: Well, that's an argument, of course, that's gone on in many places for manyyears, and I guess I would say to you that if Icould take you on a trip today and show youwhat Camden Yards has done in Baltimoreafter their Memorial Stadium experience,and Jacobs Field in Cleveland, Coors Field inDenver, and many other places. There aretwo things to be made here. One is the eco-nomic argument, and economists debate that\u2014 and I've heard them all, and I've talked tothem all \u2014 the other is what I call the socio-logical influence. Now, let me cite an ex-ample from my own hometown, where we'vehad the same kind of debate, as you know, inWisconsin. Fifty years ago \u2014 48 years ago,after a very long and bitter debate \u2014 theseare always long and bitter \u2014 County Sta-dium [in Milwaukee] was built. No majorleague team had ever moved or contem-plated being moved, and there was no ex-pansion contemplated. And yet, they hadthe vision and courage to build a stadiumwithout a tenant. As a result came the verymoving Braves experience, with Hank Aaronand Eddie Mathews and Warren Spahn, theGreen Bay Packers, with Vince Lombardi,Paul Hornung and Jim Taylor, who neverwould have survived without having Mil-waukee and County Stadium. And then 28years of the Brewers, with Paul Molitor andRobin Yount, Gorman Thomas, and so onand so forth. And so you must ask yourselfthe question, and I've asked this of manypeople: was Milwaukee, Wis., not a betterplace to live because of their vision and cour-age? And unequivocally, the answer is yes,and I submit to you that any area is a betterplace to live because it has a stadium \u2014 andthe economic development, I think, is criti-cal. The very worst people can say is, well, it's An interview with Bud Selig Should public dollars be used to finance baseball stadiums? Is a newstadium the only way to increase revenue for small-market teams such asthe Twins? These questions and others were posed to Major LeagueBaseball's acting commissioner and Milwaukee Brewers owner BudSelig, who agreed to an exclusive interview with Session Weekly prior to his appearance April 29 before a joint meeting of the Legislature's taxescommittees. a wash. Well, no other public spending ofmoney ever creates an economic wash. Atthe best, it creates $200 to $300 million ayear. Session Weekly: I don't know how familiar you are with the proposal the Pohlads haveput on the table here, but Twins owner CarlPohlad has offered 49 percent of the teamto the state in return for a new stadium, yetfor years, baseball has ruled out the publicownership of teams. How will the othermajor league owners reactto Pohlad's proposal? Selig: We don't know yet. Carl has been fastidious, and[Twins President] Jerry Bell,in keeping us informed. It'sbefore the ownership com-mittee and the executivecouncil. It will continue tobe. We're reviewing all typesof new, suggested ownershipforms, but at this point Icouldn't tell you today howthat's all going to come out.I think that Carl Pohlad andhis incredible desire to keep a team here \u2014 remember,there are other communitieswilling to build stadiums,and so one has to ask them-selves \u2014 I would ask thesame question, and I'll do ittoday \u2014 if the concept of thepublic spending money is soforeign, is everybody in every other city andarena in America and the North Americancontinent and the world wrong? I used to sayin Milwaukee, Wis., are we the only smartpeople in the world? I'd say the same thing toall of you. Session Weekly: Several of the representa- tives have said to me that the extraordinar-ily high player salaries offend many of theirconstituents. Wouldn't building a new sta-dium exacerbate that phenomenon \u2014 drivesalaries up, and anger fans even more?Selig: Well, look, baseball economics and sports economics are what they are. We have,I think, made more progress in the last yearand a half in dealing with these problemsthan ever before. We now have revenue shar-ing, which is very substantial for teams likethe Minnesota Twins and the MilwaukeeBrewers. We have cost restraints, while maybenot exactly what we wanted, certainly [they]are at least a quantum leap forward fromanything we've ever had. But what do peoplereally want? They want their team to becompetitive and they want to win, and lastyear, when you see the top eight teams in theplayoffs, the eight top payroll teams, they'redrawing well. Their fans aren't angry aboutanything. The only fans that are angry arethose that lose. So with all due respect, I mayhave to disagree with that. Session Weekly: Building the stadium could essentially put the state on the hook forbonding payments for a number of years.What would happen if there was another strike. What would thestate do, in terms of mak-ing that payment? Selig: Well, number one, I can't forecast what's going tohappen in terms of \u2014 I mean,we have labor peace for fiveyears. I want to believe, and Ido believe that all parties, af-ter the 1994 experience, arenot going to let that happenin their lifetime. I feel verycomfortable with that, and Ithink that if Don Fehr [whonegotiated the agreement onbehalf of the players] werehere, he'd would not disagreewith that either. And so, Ithink that you're building \u2014after all, when you build astadium, you build it for ageneration and a half, maybetwo generations . . . Session Weekly: Well, that Metrodome here is . . . Selig: Well, okay, this has been a little bit unique, and it's true in other places, butmost stadiums will last 40 to 45 to 50 years.There has been so much that's changed since1982, that in all fairness, nobody could see. Session Weekly: Getting to revenue shar- ing, as of June 1996, the owners did come toan agreement on a revenue-sharing deal,but teams in large markets still have an \"The very worst people cansay is, well, it's a wash.

Gallagher15 May 2, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY edge, to a large extent, because TV dollars are still mostly under local control. Whatcan be done \u2014 besides putting the smallermarket teams in new stadiums where theyget a bigger slice of the revenue pie \u2014 toaddress that? Selig: Good question, but you just made the compelling case. I said that I had run a small-market team for years. It's one of the advan-tages, doing this job, having had a lot ofpractical experience, when you look aroundat markets like Minneapolis-St. Paul, Mil-waukee, Kansas City, Seattle, San Diego, youcan look at the demographics of your mar-ket. Media revenues are tied to share demo-graphics. They're tied directly to the numberof households. And so when you exploreyour options, the only way for a small mar-ket to be viable is to have a stadium thatproduces the amount of revenue that willmake it competitive, and we came to thatconclusion, and there isn't a doubt in mymind that a new stadium built the properway, that produced the kind of revenue thatI know Carl and Jerry andeverybody wants, will keepthis club competitive, as itwill the Brewers in Milwau-kee. But without it, they haveno team. Session Weekly: Team val- ues and profits, accordingto a February issue of Fi- nancial World magazine \u2014 I don't know if you're fa-miliar with that . . . Selig: I am. I'm familiar with it, but don't equate my fa-miliarity with either accu-racy or belief . Session Weekly: The point of the article was that thevalues of the franchises andthe profit margins havebeen growing, yet ownerssay their profit marginshave taken a beating. That'sessentially what Mr. Pohladhas been saying. Selig: I don't think Financial World said the profit margins have been growing becausethey're showing the industry to have a hugeloss and almost every team losing. Session Weekly: Well, how can we reconcile the value of the franchise increasing, yetthe profit margins . . .Selig: I don't know that the values of fran- chises have increased in their local markets.I don't know that that's true at all. In fact, Iwould submit to you there is no empiricaldata to support that position. The fact of thematter is, a franchise is only valuable whenit's on the loose, when it's moving, and that'swhen its value goes up. I would say that oneof the things that gets lost in all of this is thatwhen a Carl Pohlad \u2014 who struggles andstrains to keep a team in his home town,which is remarkably different from mostpeople who own sports these days \u2014 there isno question that he's taking a financial hit todo so, and a considerable financial hit. Thereis no doubt about it. Session Weekly: A lot of people, specifically in Congress, have raised the point that base-ball enjoys an anti-trust exemption. It's theonly major sport that does. Why shouldbaseball continue to enjoy the anti-trustexemption? Selig: A simple reason and I can say it here: because it's good publicpolicy. We haven't moved ateam in 25 years, and so wehave been good citizens. Session Weekly: But the specter of moving a teamcrops up continually. Selig: Well, the specter of moving a team \u2014 look, theNational Football Leaguemoved a series of teams be-cause they couldn't controlit, not because they didn'twant to \u2014 because the Na-tional Football League is veryresponsible, and I know PaulTagilabue felt very deeplyabout it. The fact of the mat-ter is, we've been good citi-zens. We haven't abused thatthing. We also have a minorleague system that needsprotection. We have 177minor league teams in thiscountry that without an anti- trust exemption would probably be out ofbusiness, and so it's still there. It may be ananomaly, I don't think there's any questionabout that, but it's there because practically,when you look at the effects of it, it's beengood public policy. Session Weekly: What would happen if Con- gress did decide to remove it?Selig: It would make it easier to move fran- chises. It'll be interesting, because the verypeople who cried about it were crying theloudest after their football teams got moved.It would hurt the minor league system, as Ijust said, terrifically, to a point that wouldharm a lot of local economies. And then Iwould ask you the question: then what goodwas done as a result of all the damage thatwas created all over? Session Weekly: Well, people who would be for the anti-trust exemption would say, cer-tainly there would be some moving of teamsaround in the beginning as the free marketshakes out. Selig: But what about the hurting [of] the entire minor league system that affects themany small towns and small and mediummarkets in America? Session Weekly: The people who were for the free market might say the market wouldanswer that question, and some mecha-nism would crop up . . . Selig: The market may answer that question, but not to the benefit of the communitiesthat have minor league teams. The marketwill answer the question, but not happily. Session Weekly: What do you think is the biggest problem facing baseball today? Selig: Continuing to deal with the disparity of revenues between clubs and we've madean enormous amount of progress and we'regoing to continue to make an enormousamount of progress, but we need to continueto be very sensitive to that problem. Session Weekly: A lot of the new parks be- ing built \u2014 Camden Yards, Jacobs Field,PacBell Park in San Francisco \u2014 are base-ball only facilities. Yet a lot of communities\u2014 Boston, New York, etc. \u2014 are investigat-ing building facilities that are multi-pur-pose stadiums so that you can put morethan one team there. Here in Minnesota,for instance the Twins share the Dome withthe Vikings. How can one reconcile the ap-parent divergence of interests between theowners, who apparently favor baseball-only stadiums for their enhanced revenueopportunities, and the obvious public needto accommodate a number of differentsports? Selig: Well, I think what we have proved over the years \u2014 this debate has gone on in a lotof places \u2014 multi-purpose stadiums justdon't work any more. They don't, for the \" There's no question, base-ball will have a commis-sioner.

Currently, Minnesota's 11 American In- dian reservations enjoy a monopoly on ca-sino gambling operations in the state. Thetribes operate 17 separate facilities from thelarge and lucrative Mystic Lake Casino inShakopee to a tiny operation in Red Lake.However, three gaming proposals are beingput forth as a source of revenue to pay for anew ballpark for the Minnesota Twins. (See story on page 12 .) In a recent Minneapolis Star Tribune poll, 60 percent of the respon- dents favored allowing slot machines at Can-terbury Park racetrack. \"Indian gaming was not granted to us by the state,\" said Bobby Whitefeather, RedLake tribal chair. \"It is inherent in our sover-eign nation rights.\" Whitefeather sought to dispel the myth that all of the state's Indian reservations aregetting rich from casino gambling. Red Lakeis in a remote area of the state, he remindedlawmakers, and its three casinos are tinycompared to some of the larger operationsnear population centers.Indian leaders speak out on stadium gaming optionbaseball team, produce the kind of revenuethey need, and for the football team, quitefrankly, it's a problem for the football team.So when you look at what needs to be done,these cities like Baltimore, now Cleveland,and many other places, building a baseball-only park makes sense because it producesthe economic result, and football, which hasa different type of facility and needs to pro-duce, can't do it together. So what you havewhen you have a multi-purpose facility, youhave two unhappy tenants. What's the plan? Session Weekly: Twenty years ago, every- body was saying multi-purpose was the wayto go. What's changed? Selig: The economics, the ability to produce revenue, everything. Session Weekly: Well, what should we do with the Metrodome, given, let's say thatthe Twins move out?Selig: Well, I think that's a problem that I shouldn't comment on because, after all, I'mnot here and I don't know what the Vikingswant. Session Weekly: A lot of people say that what baseball needs is a strong commis-sioner who has the authority to addressmatters of public confidence and integrityin business areas. For better or worse, you,as acting commissioner, seem to be per-ceived as a sort of \"chairman of the owners'board.\" When do you plan to step down infavor of a permanent replacement? Selig: Well, let me just \u2014 without getting into a lot of detail here because it's verytough \u2014 this business about the strong,independent commissioner. The union hastheir own head. We don't intervene in thatprocess. I've heard for years that commis-sioners in all sports, quote and unquote,work for the owners and so on and so forth,and the fact is, there's a lot of mythology surrounding the commissioner's job. There'sno question, baseball will have a commis-sioner. It'll have one at the right time \u2014 wehave a search committee that's under wayand looking for it \u2014 but for anybody tothink that this so-called strong, independentcommissioner will clear up some of the thingsthat we've discussed today is just, frankly,plain mythology, and you have 70 years ofhistory under the commissioners that provethat. Session Weekly: Any names on potential candidates? Selig: No. \"We are a gaming tribe but we still do not have the resources to provide basic servicesfor our people,\" he said. \"We use it to fundmedical services, a nursing home, youth rec-reation, elderly nutrition programs and ba-sic government services.\" Indian gaming in Minnesota has been one of the model operations in the country,Whitefeather said, with Indian gaming pro-ducing in excess of 14,000 new jobs in thestate, mostly for non-Indians. \"In Red Lake,we've created 300 new jobs without stateassistance.\" Whitefeather said that the proposals be- ing discussed would open the floodgates toother non-Indian gaming developments. Bill Lawrence, a Red Lake tribal member and newspaper publisher from Bemidji, toldthe panel that though there are currently60,000 Indian people in the state, 80 percentdo not live on reservations. Minneapolis'25,000 member Indian community is one ofthe poorest in the country, he said. Less than10 percent of Minnesota Indians receive anybenefit from Indian gaming, Lawrenceclaimed, and less than 5 percent receive anynoticeable benefit. \"If the Minnesota Twins and Canterbury Park are the vehicle that Minnesota Indiansmust use to work themselves out of poverty,then I and many other will support it,\"Lawrence concluded. Dallas Ross, chair of the Board of Trustees for the Upper Sioux Community and a mem-ber of the Minnesota Indian Affairs Council,told the panel that the gambling proposalswould have a negative impact on Indiantribes in the state. \"With reservation gam-ing, we have been able to realize some ben-efits for our people,\" Ross said. \"But youcan't undo in seven years what took 150years to put in place.\" Ross asked the legislators how they would be able to say \"no\" to future gaming propos-als for other causes if they say \"yes\" to thisone. \"This is a divide and conquer proposal,\" said Harlan La Fontaine of the provision togive grants from Canterbury Park gamblingto urban Indian organizations. \"Many ur-ban Indians are already benefiting both di-rectly and indirectly from tribal gaming,\" hesaid. La Fontaine is a Sisseton Dakota wholives in Minneapolis and is a member of theMinnesota Indian Affairs Council. Mike Bongo, executive director of the Min- nesota Indian Chamber of Commerce andchair of the Minneapolis American IndianCenter, said that only three tribes receivesubstantial benefits from the state's four suc- \u2014By Steve Compton Continued on page 1717 May 2, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYTRANSPORTATION5 percent of the electorate signed a petition objecting to the increase. If the voters failedto approve the measure, local officials couldnot assess the new tax. House members also accepted an amend- ment, offered by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope), that would reduce the rate atwhich seasonal and recreational propertiesworth more than $80,000 are taxed. Oppo-nents of the provision argued that approvingthe decrease would only shift the tax burdenonto an area's year-round residents, many ofwhom are struggling with high taxes as it is. \"You're giving money to millionaires,\" at the expense of blue-collar workers, said Rep.Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia), whose dis-trict is home to some of Minnesota's mostvaluable lakeshore property. The Senate has passed a different version of the bill. Differences between the two willbe resolved by a conference committee. Selling abandoned cars Minneapolis and St. Paul police would be required to hold impounded vehicles foronly 15 days before putting them on theauction block, under a bill passed by theHouse April 30. The vote was 116-17. HF342/SF166* , sponsored in the House by Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul), wascrafted to address a problem that has Minne-apolis and St. Paul impound lots overflow-ing with cars abandoned by their owners. Current state law requires a 45-day wait before an impounded vehicle can be sold.Farrell's bill would exempt Minneapolis andSt. Paul from that law and set a 15-day limit for those cities. The bill would require local approval by the city councils in Minneapolis and St. Paulbefore it could take effect. Farrell said current law causes real prob- lems in the cities, especially during wintermonths. A winter that brings heavy snowfall\u2014 such as this winter \u2014 leads to a lot ofparking violations and a lot of cars beingtowed from city streets to the impound lot. In St. Paul, where the city impound lot holds 750 vehicles, space in the lot can runout quickly, St. Paul Police Deputy ChiefTed Brown told House Transportation andTransit Committee members earlier thissession. Most people pay the fine and pick up their cars from the impound lot within a few days,but others would rather lose their vehiclesthan pay up, according to Brown. As a result,vehicles that \u2014 in effect \u2014 are abandoned Michael Battle, an 11-year-old from CapitolHill School, got up close and personal with aMadagascar hissing cockroach in the CapitolGreat Hall April 25.

He added that sincetwo of those tribes are the state's smallest,only about 1,000 Minnesota Indians receivedirect benefits from casino profits. He refuted the idea, however, that urban Indians get no benefit from casinos, citingjobs provided at nearby Treasure Island andMystic Lake casinos and the many grantsgiven to urban Indian causes from casinoproceeds. Bongo concluded by suggesting that gam- bling revenue for the stadium should havebeen discussed as part of the welfare reformpackage since it \"is corporate welfare for therich, elite, and privileged at the expense ofIndian people.\" Highlights Continued from page 296-5900Gaming State ............... 296-0504 1-888-2341112must be allowed to take up valuable lot space for 45 days before they can be sold off. \"The 45-day rule simply makes it too dif- ficult to operate efficiently,\" Brown said. A conference committee will be appointed to resolve differences with a similar bill passedby the Senate. Continued from page 1618 SESSION WEEKLY / May 2, 1997 Using the 1997 floods as an example, U.S. Sen. Rod Grams urged a jointsession of the Minnesota Legisla- ture April 28 to view the federal govern-ment as a partner in solving stateproblems. Grams, accompanied to the Capitol by representatives of seven Minnesotatowns devastated by the floods, praisedthe work of volunteers and communityleaders and the courage of flood vic-tims. He introduced mayors and citycouncil members from Ada,Breckenridge, Crookston, East GrandForks, Granite Falls, Montevideo, andMoorhead. President Clinton has requested $448 million in disaster assistance for floodvictims, Grams reminded lawmakers.\"I anticipate it will pass quickly andwith overwhelming bipartisan support.\" Grams also has introduced legisla- tion, the \"Depository Institution Disas-ter Relief Act,\" which would givehometown bankers and credit unionsmore flexibility in lending practices inareas hardest hit by the floods. Grams stressed that Minnesota's farmers will need special help. \"Nearlytwo million acres of prime farmland areunder water,\" he said. \"The loss of live-stock is enormous.\" Speaking to \"that complex, evolving relationship\" between Minnesota andWashington, Grams said that the powerof government has shifted dramaticallyover the past 50 to 75 years to the federallevel. \"There is no longer an appropri-ate balance between the powers of thestate and those of the federal govern-ment,\" he said. \"What we are striving for in 1997 is to change the role of the federal govern-ment from that of a dictator to that of apartner,\" Grams said. \"The goal of thisnew partnership should be for Wash-ington to give back to the states theauthority to meet the needs of our state'sresidents, without the historical burdenof mandates or expensive federal rules.\" Grams said that every area of respon- sibility currently held by the federal gov-Grams views state, federal government as partners ernment needs to be reexamined. \"Ifcertain powers and responsibilitieswould be more effectively carried outby the states, then those powers shouldbe restored to the states,\" he said. \"Whether here in Minnesota or in Washington, there is no governmentissue more fundamental than that ofbudget and taxes,\" said Grams, sound-ing a popular conservative theme. \"It is ineffective for the federal gov- ernment to continue playing the role ofthe middleman who collects the taxdollars from hard-working Minneso-tans and then redistributes them, mi-nus the high cost of the Washingtonbureaucracy,\" he said. \"Contrary to whatsome people think, we don't have anational debt because people are nottaxed enough. We have a debt becausegovernment spends too much money.\" Grams outlined four steps he said the federal government must take to avoida fiscal disaster: Balance the budget andpay down the debt through increasedefficiency; cut family taxes; cut taxes for small businesses and farmers; and \"ripthe tax system out by its roots and re-place it with one built on simplicity,equality, and honesty.\" The senator mentioned his own pro- posal for a $500 per-child tax credit,which has yet to pass, as one method ofcutting family taxes. \"By leaving thatmoney in the family budget, taxpayersare then empowered to use it to directlybenefit their households,\" Grams said. On nuclear power, Grams noted that Minnesota utility rate payers have con-tributed nearly $270 million into a $13billion federal fund to pay for a perma-nent national repository for nuclearwaste by Jan. 31, 1998. The federal gov-ernment has yet to identify a site for thatrepository. \"Minnesotans have the right to ex- pect Washington to live up to its legalobligations to store nuclear wastes. TheD.C. Court of Appeals agrees, and willhand down a decision in the near fu-ture,\" Grams said. He warned that aClinton Administration plan to pay anycompensation the federal court ordersin that case, could \"make the [savingsand loan] crisis appear small.\" On a more positive note, Grams pointed to federal and state efforts inwelfare reform as \"a powerful sign\" ofthe newly developing partnership be-tween the federal and state governments.\"This new approach to welfare is anacknowledgement that welfare is not aright \u2014 it is a charity from someoneelse's labor,\" he said. Grams concluded by urging legisla- tors to grasp and use the opportunity tobuild a state-federal partnership thatserves first the interests of the peopleand then the interests of the govern-ment. \"Minnesota has a strong voicethat needs to be heard,\" he said. \"Itwould be a tragedy if a lasting legacy ofthe twentieth century were the com-plete dominance of the federal govern-ment and the silencing of the voice ofthe people here on the state level.\" U.S. Sen. Rod Grams told lawmakers April 28 thatthe federal government should be a partner andnot a dictator to the states.\u2014 By Steve Compton19 May 2, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY He was born to farmer parents in Potsdam, N.Y., in 1856, and moved with his family to Olmsted County, Minn., when he was 9years old. Little about his youth distinguished him from others ofmid-19th century America, according to biographer David Bryn-Jones, but Frank Billings Kellogg would go on to become a successfullawyer, a U. S. senator, U.S. secretary of state, and jurist on the WorldCourt before dying on the eve of his 81st birthday in 1937. Today Kellogg's memory is kept alive in St. Paul by Kellogg Boulevard, downtown St. Paul's major artery along the river bluff.His Crocus Hill home still stands on Fairmount Avenue in St. Paul.A high school in Roseville, Minn., bore his name until becoming partof Roseville Area High School in the 1980s. Until recently the Nobel Peace Prize he won in 1930 for his extensive efforts to prevent war was on display in the rotunda of theState Capitol. He was the fifth American to win the prize. In Frank B. Kellogg: A Biography , Bryn-Jones describes Kellogg's ascent during the World War I era and, especially, its aftermath, inwhich countries throughout the world struggled to define andestablish interrelations. Kellogg's talents and interests werein this area and it is where, mostly in his role as U.S.secretary of state, he made his most important contribu-tions. But long before he would gain world renown for his diplomatic and peace work, Kellogg would makea name for himself in Minnesota as an attorney inpartnership with Cushman Davis, at the time oneof the state's best-known practitioners and laterMinnesota governor and U.S. senator. Kellogg had entered the legal profession through a means long-since closed. With very limitedschooling, he left the family farm for Rochester,Minn., and began work in the law office of H.A.Eckholdt, a Norwegian immigrant. By the time heleft the firm, Kellogg had prepared himself, throughindependent study, for admission to the state bar.\"Something must be credited to the less exactingstandards of legal practice in a state still compara-tively new . . .\" Bryn-Jones writes. The author also quotes from Kellogg's memoirs about his education: \". . . we did have an educa-tional institution, a modest little country schoolknown as the Old Stone School House about twomiles from our place, and in the winter I went toschool for three months; and, besides, I shouldsay that from my eleventh to my fourteenthyear, I probably went to that school for a couple ofmonths each summer. I think that after I was fourteen years old Inever went to school at all.\" That probably seemed insignificant years later, when, his career gaining momentum, Kellogg would win the first of a string of anti-trust lawsuits against railroad companies. The suits would establishKellogg's reputation and enhance important friendships he wasmaking along the way with the likes of Theodore Roosevelt. By the1910s Kellogg would be known as \"the Trust Buster,\" according toBryn-Jones. In 1916, the man who had once suffered a crisis of confidence dueMinnesota statesman . . . Frank Kellogg: rural attorney, international diplomat to his limited schooling was ready for bigger things. After decliningseveral proposals from party representatives to run for the U.S.Senate on the Republican ticket, Kellogg was finally persuaded whenabout 70 newspaper editors of the Press Association of Minnesotasigned a petition asking for his candidacy, Bryn-Jones writes. Kellogg had been an avowed and committed Republican since the day years earlier he was asked to run for county attorney in Olmstedon the Democratic ticket. \"I was a Republican and I could not thinkthat it was just the thing under the circumstances to run on theDemocratic ticket . . . And I have never regretted my decision,\"Kellogg said years later. The newspapermen, however, would ultimately hold sway over his decision to run. Kellogg served in the U.S. Senate from 1917-1923. Then, in his bid for reelection, he was astonished to be turnedout of office. According to Bryn-Jones, Kellogg had not studiedclosely enough the social and political changes to visit Minnesotaduring his term and conducted a lackluster campaign. In 1922, timeshad been hard on agriculture and labor, ushering in the era of the Farmer-Labor Party. Kellogg had made no friends with brewers as a Prohibitionist. The Republican party was in disarray. Kellogg lost his Senate seat to Henrik Shipstead of the Farmer-Labor party. Shipstead was the first non-major party candidate from Minnesota to serve in the U.S. Senate, according to Joseph A. Burnquist in Minnesota and its People, Vol I. The loss, Bryn-Jones writes, may well have spelled the end of Kellogg's political career. He prepared toleave Washington for St. Paul to resume his law practice. Instead, his record and contacts conspiredto alter that plan. In 1923, President Warren G.Harding recruited Kellogg to join the U.S. delega-tion at the Fifth Pan-American Conference in Santiago, Chile. The next year, with his friend Calvin Coolidge in office as president, Kellogg was asked to assume the office of ambassador to Great Britain. When Coolidge's secretary of state, Charles Evans Hughes resigned, the president asked Kellogg to take over the post, which he held from 1925-1929. \"On the whole, Kellogg was a reasonably capable but un- distinguished Secretary of state,\" writes L. Ethan Ellis in the Dictionary of American Biography, Vol. XI , edited by Harris Starr and Robert Schuyler. \"He was generally conservative, an irascible but still a friendly colleague and chief, not prone to long flights of fancy or of leadership . . .\" Kellogg would become an ambassador for peace to nations across the globe, according to Bryn-Jones, with his crowning achievement the Pact of Paris in 1929, which re- nounced war. Kellogg would live out his later years as an elder statesman, serving on the Permanent Court of International Justice (or World Court)and collecting awards and recognition. In 1928, Carleton Collegeconferred upon him an honorary LL.D degree; in 1931, University ofMinnesota echoed the gesture. Hamline University awarded him aDCL degree, also in 1931. That was in addition to honorary degreesfrom 12 other colleges and universities in the U.S. and around theworld. Health problems forced him to resign from the court in 1935. Photo from Frank B.

Kellogg20 SESSION WEEKLY / May 2, 1997Pipestone National Monument in southwestern Minnesota marks astone quarry that has been in use byNative Americans since prehistorictimes. Stone pipes have been used in North America for at least 2,000 years,with ancient specimens found at archeologi-cal sites as far away as Florida and Ohio. Digging at the pipestone quarry was firstNational monument . . . Pipestone quarry site long sacred to Indian peoples At an ancient time the Great Spirit, in the form of a large bird, stood upon the wall of rock and called all the tribes around him, andbreaking out a piece of the red stone formed it into a pipe and smoked it, the smoke rolling over the whole multitude. He then told his red children that this red stone was their flesh, that they were made fromit, that they must all smoke to him through it, that they must use it for nothing but pipes: and as it belonged alike to all the tribes, the ground was sacred, and no weapons must be used or brought upon it. \u2014 Dakota account of the origin of pipestone, as recorded by George Catlin, 1836. noted by French trappers in the 17th cen- tury. Indian carvers prized this durable yetrelatively soft stone, which ranged in colorfrom mottled pink to brick red. Minnesota'spipestone deposit was originally used by mostof the Plains tribes. By about 1700, though,the Dakota Sioux controlled the quarriesand distributed the stone through trade. Smoking was regarded as a sacred activity and marked many ceremonies of the Plainspeople. By the time writer and artist GeorgeCatlin visited the quarry in 1836, pipe carv-ing had evolved into a true art form with elaborate animal and human effigies. Thepopular T-shaped calumet pipes becamewidely known as theywere often encountered by whites at treatyceremonies. As America grew westward in the 19th century, pipes found their way into whitesociety through trade. Pipes became a sourceof income for their makers, taking on a sig-nificance beyond their cultural use. By the late 1840s, pipestone was an item of some value in frontier commercial trade. Increasing contact between whites and Indians inspired new subject matter for carv-ers. Effigies often depicted white politiciansand explorers, sometimes with caricaturesfar from flattering. In 1849, a piece of pip-estone was sent to Washington, D.C. to beincorporated into the Washington Monu-ment. The Sisseton and Wahpeton bands of Da- kota signed a treaty in 1851 at Traverse deSioux, Minnesota Territory, relinquishing their rights to most of southwestern Minne-sota, including the pipestone quarry area.The treaty did not, however, include theYankton Dakota Band. A separate treaty withthe Yankton in 1858 restricted the tribe to areservation 150 miles north of the quarry butset aside one square mile of land centered onthe quarry as a reservation for their use. As the quarry became increasingly lucra- tive, white settlement threatened to con-sume the Indian claim. The city of Pipestone,a mile south of the quarry, was platted in1876, and whites were soon digging new pitsand extracting the sacred stone. Other set-tlers erected homesteads on the Yanktonland. For decades the Indians struggled tomaintain their rights to the quarry and sur-rounding reservation. During this period,efforts to create a state park at the quarrystalled due to the dispute over ownership ofthe land. Finally, in 1928, the Yanktons soldtheir claim to the federal government. Ironically, as soon as the government took over the property, local residents in Pip-estone began clamoring for the establish-ment of a \"National Indian Pipestone Park\"to preserve the historical and ethnologicalvalues of the area and to \"grant quarryingrights to Indians of all tribes.\" Formal legislation to make the area a na- tional park was introduced by MinnesotaSen. Henrik Shipstead in 1934 but stalled incommittee. A similar bill put forth the fol-lowing year passed the Senate but was ig-nored by the House. Reintroduced two yearslater with the name changed to PipestoneNational Monument, the bill finally passedand was signed into law by President FranklinD. Roosevelt on Aug. 25, 1937. Federal park recognition did not unleash a flood of money to develop the 116 acre site,however. Sporadic local and federal improve-ment efforts continued for the next few years.The register for 1941 showed 1,500 out-of-state visitors. Development activity was re-newed after World War II when federalregulations governing Indian quarryingrights were adopted. The monument wasplaced on a year-round operational basis in1948. During the next decade, roads wereimproved, trails added, and visitor facilitiesupgraded. An exhibition pit was opened andlater, an adjacent visitor center. In 1957, anadditional 167 acres were annexed to thepark, bringing it to a total of 283 acres.

For years, the map lay undiscovered, tucked away in the Vose family collection,even as historians struggled to accuratelyreconstruct the old outpost, now known asFort Snelling. Recently, though, in what rep-resentatives from the Minnesota HistoricalSociety are calling perhaps their most im-portant acquisition, the document has re-surfaced. Last week, in the rotunda of the State Capitol, accompanied by guards clad inperiod uniform, state officials displayed themap for the first time since purchasing it for$11,500 from a Connecticut military docu-ment dealer. \"The map provides insight as to why some changes were made . . . in the transition fromfort to ar-chaeologist Bob Crouse said. \"We also knowthat there were other changes made and thatsome of the things constructed here werelater moved within a year and a half.\" Scholars involved with reconstructing the fort in the 1970s based their work on con-struction plans now housed at the NationalArchives in Washington D.C., and archaeo-logical evidence gathered at the site, Crousesaid. Many times, they had to guess at theanswers to basic questions. This map, Crousesaid, not only confirms as correct many ofthose decisions, it gives historians a muchmore accurate picture of the fort's evolution. \"Almost all the maps made at that time were done for official use,\" and consequentlyare owned by the federal government, JonWalstrom, historical society map curator,said at the April 25 unveiling. \"This is rare.\"Uncovering history . . . Map discovery reveals details of Fort Snelling's past The state purchased the 19-inch by 26- inch map with a donation made by John andElizabeth Driscoll, of St. Paul. The hand-drawn document is signed by its maker,Joseph E. Heckle, a quartermaster stationedat the fort, and Vose apparently used themargins to describe for his family many ofthe living conditions of the day. Vose arrived in the area around 1819 as part of a military expedition, under the com-mand of Lt. Col. Henry Leavenworth, toestablish an outpost on the frontier. Thesoldiers, looking to protect the burgeoningfur trade with a permanent American pres-ence, built a stockade at the confluence of theMinnesota and Mississippi rivers, about ahalf-mile away from where the permanentstructure would be located. Conditions at the time, according to a recent Minneapolis Star Tribune story, were brutal. Leavenworth begged his superiorsfor a transfer, even as his troops died build- ing the permanent fort. By the spring of1820, 30 men were dead, but Leavenworthgot his wish. Command of the facility wasassigned to Col. Josiah Snelling, for whomthe structure was named in 1825. The map can be seen at the Minnesota History Center, near the State Capitol, whereit will be on display until June 2, when cura-tors will move it into environmentally con-trolled storage. The historical society alsoplans to reproduce the map and publish abook explaining the margin notes and theprocess by which the map was created. \"It is rare to have an opportunity to add such a remarkable map to the collections ofthe Minnesota Historical Society,\" Walstromsaid. \"Both the information value and theartifactual value of the map are immeasur-able.\" site today includes a waterfall on PipestoneCreek, quartzite bluffs, native tallgrass prai-rie land, Pipestone National Monument is cur- rently visited by more than 100,000 peopleContinued from page 20 each year.

April 24 - May 1, 1997 Once a bill has passed both the House and the Senate in identical form, it's ready to besent to the governor for consideration. Thegovernor has several options when consid-ering a bill. The governor can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which results in the bill becom- ing law in the first year of the biennium. The timing of these actions is as significantas the actions themselves. In the first year of the biennium, the im- portant thing to remember is that the gover-Bills await governor's action nor has three days from the time of \"present-ment\" to veto a bill. If the governor doesn'tsign the bill within this time frame, it willbecome law with or without his signature.(Sundays are not counted in the three-daytime limit, but holidays are.) Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to eliminatethe appropriation items to which he objects.As with all vetoes, the governor must includea statement listing the reasons for the vetowith the returned bill. Here, too, the time-table is within three days after the governorreceives the bill. A two-thirds vote of the members in eachhouse is needed to override a veto. But be- cause only the governor can call a specialsession of the Legislature, anything vetoedafter the Legislature adjourns is history \u2014 atleast until the next year. The governor's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota Constitution (Article IV,Section 23).

Therefore,deliberations must be completed by May 19, 1997. This means very long days foreveryone, but most staff and the work they perform prevail as the silent heroes in thesefinal hours. It is not unusual for staff to work 12 to 18 hours a day as they research amendments, rewrite bills, or even as they: assist members with preparing their meeting schedules;ensure that all legislative decisions are accurately recorded; and perform many otherlegislative duties unseen by the general public. In a two-week period, some individualsaccrued more time than the 88 hours they get paid for. One, for example, chalkedup182 hours, while another spent 177 hours accomplishing assigned responsibilities! As House members meet in session to move bills toward passage, other legislators meet with the Senate in conference committees to iron out differences in companionbills. This can be a marathon effort for staff who must be available at all times to assistwith accomplishing whatever is necessary to get bills passed on to the governor. Silent heroes usually serve as observers of the legislators in conference. Quietly, they watch as members sometimes go through a process likened to an acrimoniousMonopoly game standoff (\"You can have Park Place; I will take Boardwalk!\") beforecompanion bills go back to the respective legislative bodies. Other silent heroes perform their duties in House Research, the revisor's office, majority and minority caucus leadership, the reference library, caucus media andresearch departments, the Fiscal Analysis Department, the House Public InformationOffice, the Sergeant's office and Educational Programs, and administrative servicesand supply. Heroes also include legislative assistants and committee administratorsto the elected body, TV Services, and Duplicating, where bills and House Journals getprinted, often at 3 a.m. It is not uncommon to see the main desk staff of the Chief Clerk's Office working at their stations two hours after session has ended. Others in the clerk's office maintainthe status of bills, proofread, search the index for names or numbers of bills forindividuals, and perform other duties to keep the process flowing. Other heroes like the editors, writers, and photographers of House Information and its assistants who answer hundreds of telephone inquiries, also spend an unusualamount of hours on an ongoing basis to give an up-to-date account of the Legislatureand its actions. Particular tribute is given to the pages in the Sergeant's office who are always the last to leave a committee meeting or a late night session. About 209 hours are left (as of 7 a.m., May 9) before the 1997 Legislative Session must adjourn. Legislators and staff have \". . . miles to go before [they] sleep!\" \u2014LeClair G. Lambert3 May 9, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . May 1 - 8, 1997 Highlights By Celeste Riley An omnibus DWI bill cleared the House Ways and Means Committee on May 7, andnow heads to the House floor. An oftenchallenged provision to lower the legal blood-alcohol limit from 0.10 percent to 0.08 per-cent remains in the bill. HF1004/SF985* is an effort to tighten laws that discourage and prohibit driving whileunder the influence of alcohol. Last year inMinnesota, police made 38,900 DWI arrests,a significant jump from the year before, when33,355 arrests were made, according to AlanRodgers of the Minnesota Department ofPublic Safety. \"Last year was the most [arrests] we've ever had,\" Rodgers said. \"There were so many[that] I questioned the number. It had beengoing down\" in previous years. Of 576 trafficdeaths in Minnesota in 1996, about 200 werealcohol-related, he said. Nationwide, alco-hol played a role in 17,000 of 40,000 trafficdeaths. An amendment to limit the 0.08 standard to repeat offenders only, as the Senate ver-sion of the bill currently does, was narrowlydefeated. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester)said that the lower standard will unnecessar-ily criminalize people and does not accu-rately reflect the facts about alcoholimpairment. He said that people pulled overfor unrelated traffic offenses, such as a burnedout headlight, could be arrested for a failedbreath test, even though their driving wasn'taffected. \"They [bill supporters] want a presump- tion of guilt. They don't want to have toprove the cases,\" Bishop said. \"We're goingto apply [the lower standard] whether or notdriving and behavior are being influenced.\" Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), the bill's sponsor, said that the new standardwould save lives. A House Research Depart-ment report states that based on studies ofother states, the lower level could save about14 lives every year in Minnesota and about$6.3 million in associated social costs. The 0.10 standard is arbitrary and \"wasn't based on research,\" Entenza said, addingthat . . DWI changes: Lowering the legal limit controversial blood alcohol content strongly support alower limit. Further, he said, drivers whocause alcohol-related fatalities are over-whelmingly first-time offenders, which iswhy he wants to make sure the measure isnot weakened. He was backed by Rep. DougSwenson (R-Forest Lake), who said, \"Weneed to send a message to everyone that youneed to be sober when you drive.\" If the bill becomes law, Minnesota will join 10 other states and nine countries with0.08 percent limits. Seven countries now setthe limit below 0.08 percent. According to information compiled by the House Research Department, the newlimit would mean that a 175-pound mancould drink three drinks in an hour withinthe legal limit; the fourth would put himover it. A 130-pound woman could drinktwo drinks in an hour, but would reach ablood-alcohol level of 0.077 percent, bring-ing her closer to the limit than a man wouldbe at three drinks. Other factors, of course, would make a difference, such as the amount of food peopleeat and how quickly they drink. In addition to lowering the legal blood-alcohol limit, the bill also would lower to 0.04 percent the legal limit for drivers under21 years old. An amendment to eliminate theprovision was defeated by a 13-8 vote. \"This will make criminals out of kids,\" said Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFLVirginia). \"[Aperson] Swenson cally that young drivers are overrepresentedin fatal crashes. They're inexperienced withdriving and with drinking and are generallyimmature, making them more dangerouson the road. They kill themselves and theykill others,\" Swenson said. \"All people areimpaired to some degree [at 0.04 percent ].These people are impaired more.\" While state law prohibits any alcohol con- sumption by people under 21, the 0.04 per-cent provision would make it easier to applyDWI penalties to youthful offenders. The bill also would stiffen penalties for DWI offenses. A first offense is now a misde-meanor; the second, a gross misdemeanor.Under the bill, a third offense or more within10 years would fall under a new classificationof enhanced gross misdemeanor, which couldmean two years in jail and a $3,000 fine. Drinking and driving continues to threaten Minnesotans. Last year in Minnesota, police made 38,900DWI arrests, a significant jump from the year before, when 33,355 arrests were made. A provision inthe omnibus DWI bill would lower the legal blood-alcohol limit from 0.10 percent to 0.08 percent.4 SESSION WEEKLY / May 9, 1997Mandatory criminal penalties also would be restructured. A second gross misdemeanoroffense would carry a 30-day minimum sen-tence in jail. Under the enhanced gross mis-demeanor provisions, a third DWI within 10years would net a 90-day minimum jail sen-tence with at least 30 days served; the fourthoffense within 10 years would net a 180-dayminimum sentence with at least 30 daysserved; a fifth or greater offense within 15years would result in a one-year minimumjail sentence with at least 60 days served. Theremainder of any sentence not served mustbe served on home detention using elec-tronic monitoring or under an intensive pro-bation program. If an enhanced grossmisdemeanor offense involves the endan-germent of a child or an alcohol concentra-tion of 0.20 or more, the minimum penaltieswould be advanced by one level. In otherwords, a person whose crime would nor-mally be a misdemeanor would be chargedwith a gross misdemeanor if either of the twoconditions applied. Additionally, those awaiting trial could agree to electronic alcohol monitoring as ameans of being released from detention.Under the program, the person could notconsume any amount of alcohol and wouldprovide at least one breath sample daily viaspecial equipment, which enables the resultsto be transmitted to authorities through thetelephone. Alcohol monitoring also could be used as part of a sentence after a conviction. Peoplewith two or more convictions within fiveyears (or three or more within 10 years)would participate in alcohol monitoring inaddition to other probation or sentencingconditions. Just as under pre-trial monitor-ing conditions, no alcohol consumption isallowed. The bill also says that the offendermay be required to pay the cost of the moni-toring. Other bill provisions include: Increased sanctions and penalties for driv- ers who drink and drive at a blood alcohollevel of 0.20 or more, which is twice thecurrent minimum level of impairment.Gross misdemeanor penalties would applyeven for a first offense, as would court-ordered counseling at the court's discre-tion. Electronic alcohol monitoring wouldbe mandatory as a condition of pre-trialrelease. Drivers arrested for DWI offenses would no longer be able to demand that a secondalcohol concentration test be conductedby an independent tester. The cost to have a driver's license reinstated after a suspension or revocation for anytraffic offense would be increased from$20 to $25.25. For people convicted of DWI, the current $260 fee would remainthe same. Authorities would have an easier time im- posing vehicle forfeiture penalties for DWIoffenses. Instead of having to wait for aconviction, cars could be impounded afterthe offender's driver's license has been re-voked. A \"not-a-drop\" standard would apply to school bus drivers. This means any alcoholdetected could result in the loss of a driver'slicense. Currently, bus drivers are subjectto a 0.04 blood-alcohol level to define im-pairment. Drivers of commercial vehicleswould be breaking the law with a level of0.04 or more blood alcohol content. Entenza said the bill would have a positive fiscal impact because it increases fees fordriver's license reinstatement and suspen-sions and other fees. Rukavina said the costsof the bill will be \"astronomical\" because itwould tie up the court system and cost policedepartments more for additional DWItesting. BUSINESSSALES Signed by the governorUnauthorized switches The practice is known as slam- ming and loading. A long-dis-tance telephone company sends acustomer a check, a sweepstakesform, or a survey. What the cus-tomer often doesn't realize is that by participating or signing, they've autho-rized the company to remove (\"slam\") thecustomer's long-distance service and replace(\"load\") it with a new one. A new law signed by the governor estab- lishes the practice as consumer fraud andauthorizes the attorney general's office totake action at a customer's request. The law, effective April 30, 1997, says it is fraudulent to change a customer's servicewithout the customer's verified consent, andthat it is the responsibility of the telephonecompany to prove consent. \"If there's any question\" on the customer's part about the switch being legally autho-rized, \"the company has to have an authori-zation in writing,\" said Rep. Mike Delmont(DFL-Lexington), the House bill's sponsor. A 1996 law required that a long-distance company reinstall a customer's original ser-vice at no charge and then re-bill the cus-tomer at a lower rate if the original chargeswould have been lower. The new bill addsthat the company could be required to ab-sorb the long-distance costs accrued while the unauthorized service was in effect. Sen. Janet Johnson (DFL-North Branch ) sponsored the Senate proposal. HF1123*/SF1156/CH68 CHILDREN Signed by the governorStudying autism A bill to establish a task force to study the treatment of autism hasbeen signed into law. Autism is a disorder that affects children and consists of a preoc-cupation with inner thoughts, daydreams, delusions, and hallucinations.The individual lacks a connection with real-ity and the self often predominates to thetotal exclusion of the rest of the world. Under the new law, the departments of human services and children, families andlearning are charged with establishing thetask force which will study the spectrum ofautistic disorders; treatment options, includ-ing behavioral therapy, and outcome dataon these treatment options; the role ofschools, state agencies, and counties in pro-viding services to children with autism; fund-ing options for children with autism; the useof behavioral therapy day treatment pro-grams, and the use of school and MedicalAssistance funds for these programs. A final report is due to the Legislature by Jan. 15, 1999, and must make recommenda-tions on how to improve the treatment op-tions available to children with autism usingexisting dollars. Also, it must recommendways to inform and educate families withautistic children on available resources andexpertise for the treatment of autism. Rep. Fran Bradley (R-Rochester) and Sen. Sheila Kiscaden (R-Rochester) sponsored thenew law, which becomes effective Aug. 1,1997. HF750/SF652*/CH69 CRIME Signed by the governorHarassing, stalking, sentencing A new law to strengthen the state's anti-stalking law andtoughen penalties for those vio-lating orders for protection andrestraining orders was signed bythe governor. The law defines harassing or stalking be- havior as intentional conduct that the of-fender knows or has reason to know wouldcause the victim to feel frightened, threat-5 May 9, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY EDUCATIONSCHOOLened, oppressed, persecuted, or intimidated. Importantly, the bill states that prosecutorswould not be required to prove that theoffender intended to cause those reactions inthe victim, only that the offender knew orshould have known that the conduct wouldcause the reactions and that the victim did,in fact, experience them. In the event a dan-gerous weapon is used during a harassmentor stalking violation, the offense would bepunished by a mandatory minimum sen-tence. If the weapon is a firearm, a three-yearpenalty applies for the first offense, and afive-year penalty applies to subsequent of-fenses; if the dangerous weapon is not afirearm, a one-year penalty applies to thefirst offense, and a three-year penalty appliesto subsequent offenses. The changes were necessary given a recent Minnesota Supreme Court ruling that weak-ened the current stalking law. The law also creates felony penalties for violating an order for protection or a harass-ment restraining order under certain cir-cumstances. Such cases will include violationsoccurring within five years after sentencingfrom two or more previous protection orrestraining order violations, or if the of-fender possessed a dangerous weapon dur-ing the offense. Other violations of restraining orders will draw the felony penalty if the act is moti-vated by race, religion, sex, sexual orienta-tion, disability, age or national origin; if theoffender intends to interfere with a judicialproceeding or retaliate against an officialinvolved in a case; if the victim is a minor andthe offender is at least three years older; or ifthe offender falsely impersonates another. Under the law, offenders could be sen- tenced to a maximum of five years in prisonand a $10,000 fine. A minimum of 30 days injail (and counseling) will be mandated for afelony protection order violation in caseswhere the court stays the sentence as a con-dition of probation. Finally, the law clarifies that an offender may not waive the right to be sentencedunder the state's sentencing guidelines. Theprovision is a result of the Minnesota Su-preme Court's ruling in State v. Givens , and is intended to promote consistency and pre-dictability in judicial sentencing. In the Givens case, the defendant agreed to accept probation instead of incarcerationfor a purse-snatching offense. However,under the conditions of the agreement, if heviolated probation, he would serve doublethe jail time recommended under the guide-lines. The offender later did violate proba-tion, but appealed the sentence.The law makes it clear that while the guide- lines are advisory to the courts, they are notrights that a defendant can waive. The law also states that if a defendant agrees to be sentenced outside the guide-lines, he or she may not appeal the sentenceafter 90 days or after committing anothercrime, whichever is first. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) and Sen.Ember Reighcott Junge (DFL-New Hope). HF5*/SF32/CH96 Statewide testing finalized A bill that would establish a statewide testing system requiring uniform exams tobe given to virtually all students at severalgrade levels is on its way to the governor. The bill ( HF2179*/SF1934 ), sponsored by Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud), wouldrequire uniform statewide testing of third,fifth, and eighth graders beginning in the1997-1998 school year. The bill passed both the House (102-32) and Senate (59-0) May 5. Opatz said the tests would be an integral part of the state's move toward an educationsystem that demands schools and studentsbe more accountable for taxpayer funds in-vested in education. Statewide testing had been a controversial issue at the Capitol in years past, but this yearit drew bipartisan support. Proponents claim such testing would provide a reliable meansfor comparing the performance of schoolsand districts. The first law passed during the 1997 ses- sion ( HF1*/SF3/CH1 ) mandated that state- wide testing would begin during the1997-1998 school year. Opatz's bill prescribeshow that testing system will work. Under the bill, the basic skills tests in reading and math \u2014 already required underthe state's graduation rule and first given tostudents in the eighth grade \u2014 would countas the statewide test for that age group. Third and fifth graders would be given tests selected by the Department of Chil-dren, Families and Learning. The depart-ment could use a test it has developed or anationally recognized test such as the Cali-fornia Achievement Test or the Iowa Test ofBasic Skills. Any test used in the statewidetesting system would have to be aligned withthe state's graduation standards. The version of the bill initially approved by the House also called for testing of 11thgraders beginning during a later year, but theSenate bill did not call for testing at the highschool level. Instead, the bill now would ask districts to assess the performance of students at thesecondary level according to the standardswithin the Profile of Learning, a state-devel-oped system of measurements of overall stu-dent performance, and a part of the newlydeveloped graduation standards. The bill calls for the assessment of second- Sixth graders from Washington Elementary School in New Ulm, Minn., got a special lessonfrom historic site guide Pamela Larson May 7 as part of Minnesota Statehood Week.

The commissioner would be required to report to the Legislature in 1998 on plans forassessment at the high school level. The bill would allow only narrow excep- tions to the statewide testing requirements.For example, students who are new to thiscountry and are not proficient in Englishwould be exempt. Another provision in the bill would re- quire that the 1997-1998 test results fromeach school and each district be used toestablish a baseline against which their fu-ture performance could be measured. Test results would be reported to the pub- lic in three forms: a raw number represent-ing the mean score for each school anddistrict, a mean score of all students exceptthose who are new to a school or district, anda mean score of all students except thosereceiving limited English proficiency instruc-tion. The results released to the public also would include the number of students onfree and reduced-price lunch programs, thenumber of special education students, andthe number of students with limited Englishproficiency at each site. Rep. Becky Kelso (DFL-Shakopee), who chairs the House K-12 Education FinanceDivision, said the new testing system is im-portant mostly because it will inform par-ents and other taxpayers. \"Students have always taken tests,\" Kelso said. \"It's not the tests that work to helpschools and help students. It is the changethat comes with public understanding ofstudent achievement.\" ELECTIONSGOVERNMENT Absentee voting Any voter who wishes to vote by absentee ballot could do so under a bill passed by theHouse May 6 on an 81-50 vote. HF74/SF78* would eliminate existing re- strictions that bill supporters say keep ab-sentee participation unnecessarily low.However, voters still would be asked to statea reason \u2014 any reason \u2014 for voting byabsentee ballot. Under current law, voters must provide one of several reasons to vote outside anofficial polling place: an expected absencefrom the precinct, illness, disability, reli-gious discipline, observance of a religiousholiday, or service as an election judge in another precinct. The bill would eliminatethose provisions. \"This way no one has to lie about being out of the precinct,\" said Rep. Tom Osthoff(DFL-St. Paul), the bill's sponsor. \"We canhelp about 5 percent of the public to partici-pate in the process who are not currentlyparticipating.\" Opening the process of absentee balloting is intended to increase voter participation,according to Osthoff and Secretary of StateJoan Growe, who previously testified in sup-port of the bill. In Ramsey County, where afour-year pilot program for unrestrictedabsentee balloting began in 1993, absenteevoters have grown to 12 percent, comparedwith a statewide average of 6 percent. Bill sponsors believe the proposal will es- pecially encourage the elderly to vote, givenrecent consolidations of polling places thathave made their locations more difficult forsuch residents to reach. \"Last election we were able to get the numbers up in my district \u2014 which has oneof the lowest turnouts in Minnesota \u2014 by afew thousand votes,\" said Rep. Andy Dawkins(DFL-St. Paul). \"We did it by knocking ondoors and getting people to register. A lot ofpeople took advantage of the ability to voteby absentee ballot without having to articu-late a reason.\" The absentee ballot initiative is not the same as a vote-by-mail program, propo-nents have noted. In the latter, ballots areautomatically sent to all registered voters.With absentee voting, voters must requestthat a ballot be sent to them. Other provisions would enable hospital patients to have ballots delivered to them byhand. The bill also says that individuals couldreceive only one ballot each, and ballots canbe received and sent via fax machine. The bill now goes to a conference committee. Vote by mail Under a bill passed by the House May 6, more Minnesotans would be able to vote bymail. The vote was 72-59. Under current law, rural cities and towns with 400 or fewer registered voters are ableto conduct mail-in elections. HF168/SF703* , sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy), would allow voters in precinctswith 50 or fewer voters to vote by mail.Adding the precinct designation, even withthe smaller number of voters, allows moreareas to participate in mail-in voting. That'sbecause some towns with populations ofmore than 400 lie in more than one county,creating very small precincts within metro- politan areas. The bill would allow those precincts to avoid the expense of operating a pollingplace and other election-related efforts fortheir limited number of voters. \"This is a bill that allows very small pre- cincts to vote by mail. Statewide, it affectsonly about 284 registered voters,\" Tunheimsaid. The bill now returns to the Senate. New home for revenue Consultants retained by the Legislature to study alternative locations for the Depart-ment of Revenue building have recom-mended that the agency relocate to a new sitein Inver Grove Heights. Jim Steinmann, the executive director of the Los Angeles-based SGS Group, said at aMay 6 informational meeting of the HouseCapital Investment Committee and the Sen-ate Finance Committee's State GovernmentDivision that his firm had evaluated fourpossibilities, including refurbishing thedepartment's existing 10 Riverfront Plazabuilding, opposite downtown St. Paul on theMississippi River. Of the four, he said, con-structing a new building at the intersectionof Interstate 494 and Highway 52 in InverGrove Heights presents the most cost-effec-tive solution to the department's need formore space. The project, he said, carries aprice tag of $49.5 million. \"We support his recommendation for con- struction in Inver Grove Heights,\" said rev-enue department Assistant CommissionerJohn Lally, adding that the proposal emergedout of a competitive-bid process. The revenue department has occupied its current site since 1988, when it relocatedfrom the Centennial Office Building. At thattime, the state negotiated a five-year lease \u2014with five one-year renewal options \u2014 withSt. Paul's JLT Group, who built the buildingto department specifications. Last year, thedepartment exercised its last renewal optionand paid JLT $6.3 million in rent. Now, according to the SGS study, the de- partment, has outgrown the riverfront build-ing. It will need even more space by 2010,when it will employ nearly 1,500 workers.Perhaps more importantly, Steinmann said,the pace of technological innovation showsno sign of slowing and the new buildingwould provide an increased capacity to ex-pand the department's information infra-structure.7 May 9, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYHEALTH\"We have built into specification every bit of specification for technology that we areaware of in 1997,\" Steinmann said. \"This is a40-year building, at least.\" A new building, Steinmann said, would cost less than retrofitting the existing loca-tion, which he said also has air quality issues. The latest SGS report represents some- thing of a departure from previous recom-mendations. At a Feb. 25 meeting, Steinmannpresented the joint committee with twometropolitan locations: a downtown St. Paulsite at East 11th and Wabasha streets or thecorner of 13th and Robert streets, currentlyoccupied by the state's motor pool. The InverGrove Heights location would be nearly $50million cheaper than either of those, accord-ing to the latest analysis. James Erickson, representing JLT, dis- agreed with Steinmann's remarks. The state,he said, could purchase the Riverfront Plazabuilding for $38.9 million, $10 millioncheaper than the cost attached to the SGSproposal. That money, he said, could beapplied toward renovations. \"I want you to know, you have a Cadillac of a building here,\" Erickson said, addingthat he was not aware of any air-qualityconcerns. \"We have an elegant proposal onthe table. We have a magnificent building indowntown St. Paul . . . negotiate with us.\" Erickson also pointed out that current law requires the Legislature to locate its princi-pal administrative offices in or near the Capi-tol, a point that Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St.Paul) reiterated. \"If we start doing this, we're never goingManaging managed care A bill that would create a patient protec- tion act in Minnesota to help consumers anddoctors better deal with health plans andinsurance companies passed the House May6. The vote was 132-0. HF1365/SF960* is a beginning and a deli- cate compromise between consumer groups,health care providers, health maintenanceorganizations (HMOs), and insurance plans,said House sponsor Rep. Linda Wejcman(DFL-Mpls). Although she asked lawmakers not to alter her bill and risk dismantling the compro-mise, several amendments were successful. Calling the bill \"Swiss cheese\" with \"holes everywhere,\" Rep. Ron Abrams (R-Minnetonka) successfully offered an amend-ment he said would provide more consumerprotection. He labeled the original bill not tough enough and said the compromise leaned toofar in favor of the HMOs and insurancecompanies. It is important to note, however, that the bill would not affect self-insured businesses,which the state cannot regulate. Roughly The Grim Reaper, played by Yellow Cloud, of Duluth, was on hand with the MinnesotaWelfare Rights Coalition as they protested Minnesota's new welfare law in the Capitolrotunda May 7.Welfare ritesto stop,\" Trimble said of the move towardthe suburbs. \"There'll always be land some-where that's cheaper. What are we going todo with that [Riverfront Plaza] land, peddleit off to McDonald's?\"one-third of Minnesotans are in self-insured plans. Below are some of the highlights of the bill. Health plans would be prohibited from retaliating against doctors and other healthcare providers simply because they criti-cized a health plan's coverage or made arecommendation about the desirability ofa plan. Doctors and other providers alsowould be free to discuss \u2014 without fear ofretaliation \u2014 diagnostic, treatment, or re-ferral options not covered or limited underthe health plan. Insurance companies and HMOs also could not punish a health care provider foradvocating on behalf of a patient or for tell-ing the patient about the financial agree-ment between himself or herself and thehealth plan. Furthermore, health plans could not re- taliate against doctors or other providerswho support or oppose legislation and tes-tify on bills either before the Legislature orthe U.S. Congress. Retaliation can take many forms. A health plan, for instance, could choose to eliminatea doctor from its network of providers. In certain cases, health plans now hire outside doctors \u2014 often from other states\u2014 to review what medical tests or proce-dures are appropriate for which condi-tions. They can overrule therecommendation of a patient's doctor.Under the bill, only doctors licensed inMinnesota could review cases involvingMinnesota patients. This, Abrams said,would help keep the review doctors ac-countable. Customers enrolled in a health plan or even potential customers would have the rightto see a clear explanation of the healthplan's financial agreement with the doc-tors and other providers in its network.Specifically, portions of the agreement thatwould in any way make it advantageous forthe provider to limit the care offered mustbe disclosed. Under the bill, patients would be notified of their right to their medical records. Themeasure states that every time a healthrecord is generated, the provider shall no-tify the patient of his or her right to receivea copy. This provision is the result of anamendment by Rep. Eileen Tompkins (R-Apple Valley). A separate provision introduced by Rep. Mike Osskopp (R-Lake City) requireshealth plans to make public their top fivehighest salaries, including all types of com-pensation.8 SESSION WEEKLY / May 9, 1997INDUSTRY Signed by the governorHealth care directives A Minnesota driver's license can tell you a lot about a personbesides age, height, and weight. Anew state law, effective Jan. 1,1998, will allow for a bit moreinformation to be included on that small plastic card. Existing law requires a driver's license ap- plication to include space to indicate whethera driver has a living will, a document thatdeclares a person's preferences for medicaltreatment to prolong life under dire circum-stances. A short message to emergency and medi- cal personnel is included on the licenses ofpeople who indicate that they have livingwills. The new law will expand the health-care related information that can be included ona driver's license. Under the law, the license application will allow people to indicate if they have a \"livingwill/health care directive,\" and the changewill be reflected in the message that appearson licenses. The expanded license designation will serve people who have granted another per-son durable power of attorney for healthcare and people who have other written ad-vance health care directives allowed understate law.INSURANCEINSURANCE Signed by the governor The departments of commerce and health would review contracts between healthplans and doctors and assess civil penaltiesfor violations. Health plans would be required to estab- lish, when appropriate, a way for consum-ers to apply for a standing referral to aspecialist. Oftentimes, a patient must seetheir regular doctor over and over again toget permission to see a specialist. Several state agencies would be required to study together the feasibility of consolidat-ing the numerous consumer help officesexisting today. Currently, the state has be-tween 15 and 20 different places in govern-ment for consumers to call to complainabout their health care, said Rep. TomHuntley (DFL-Duluth). The Department of Commerce and the Department of Health would be requiredto report to the Legislature by Jan. 15,1998, on how to develop a complaint reso-lution process for health plans to offer totheir customers. The bill heads next to a conference com- mittee to work out the differences betweenthe House and Senate versions.(Durable power of attorney for health care is an arrangement by which someone is des-ignated to make decisions regarding medicaltreatment for you if you are unable to makethose decisions yourself.) Gov. Arne Carlson signed the measure into law April 28. The legislation was spon-sored by Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester)and Sen. Jane Ranum (DFL-Mpls). HF179*/SF178/CH60 Underground communication Beneath public streets, countless miles of lines and cables run under the pavement, allcarrying services for water, electricity, sewer,natural gas, telephones, and cable television. The underground has become even busier in recent years with the advent of new tech-nologies and new uses for the technology,such as those for telephones. The result?Increased demand for limited space. The House passed a bill May 2 that would regulate the rights-of-way to the under-ground for telecommunications and relatedcompanies. HF322/SF442* , sponsored in the House by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Har-ris), was passed on a 128-4 vote. Jenningssaid the bill is the result of months of nego-tiation between local governments and in-dustry members, and successfully balancespublic and commercial interests. Under the proposal, towns and cities would manage underground access by requiring:registration and permits; plans for construc-tion; construction performance bonds andinsurance coverage; and project data reports.They also could establish installation andconstruction standards; location require-ments for equipment and facilities; coordi-nation and andremoval requirements for abandonedequipment. Cities may recover \"actual costs\" from the companies for providing administrative ser-vices, such as processing applications, con-ducting inspections, and issuing permits,but may not charge more. Currently, citiescan charge only $25 in fees. The telecommu-nications companies remain fully respon-sible for returning road or other surfaces totheir previous condition. Cities must treat companies equally, ac- cording to the bill, and may not deny under-ground access except when necessary forhealth or safety reasons, or in the event of asubstantial breach of the terms and condi-tions of access (or several other relatedconditions).In the event of a dispute, the bill would require a review by the authorized unit ofgovernment, which would have to submit areport in support of its decision. A companythen could ask to have the matter settledthrough arbitration, paid for equally by bothparties. Finally, the bill would direct the Public Utilities Commission to develop a set ofstatewide standards to govern use of theright-of-way. The rules would apply to con-struction standards, maintenance, and re-pair. A report to the Legislature would bedue by November 1997. The bill now returns to the Senate. Managing diabetes Health plans will be required to provide coverage for training andeducation to assist diabetics inmanaging their disease under anew state law effective Aug. 1. The measure passed 124-5 in the House April 18 and 62-2 in the SenateApril 21. Gov. Arne Carlson signed the legis-lation into law April 28. The law will expand a 1994 law requiring medical insurance companies and healthmaintenance organizations to provide cov-erage for syringes, blood-testing devices, andother equipment diabetics need. The aim of the new law is to ensure diabet- ics are properly trained to use the medicalequipment and to monitor their own condi-tion. The law also will require medical nutri-tion therapy to be included in healthcoverage. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Tom Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) and Sen. SteveNovak (DFL-New Brighton). HF653/SF495*/CH57 Preventing rate hikes A new state law effective April 29 will prevent insurance ratehikes for people who are passen-gers on city buses involved in traf-fic accidents. Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) spon-sored the measure in the Legislature. Gov.Arne Carlson signed the proposal into lawApril 28. The impetus for the legislation came from an 86-year-old resident of Farrell's legisla-tive district in St. Paul.Signed by the governor9 May 9, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Kelly Rand Waters, of Minneapolis, found a sunny spot in the rotunda to attend to her 4- month-old daughter, Sequoia, during a rally celebrating International Midwives Day. TheMinnesota Midwives Guild and Minnesotans for Midwifery, together with other interestedorganizations, are a part of the Midwives Regulation Task Force, which is pursuing statelicensure for direct-entry midwives in Minnesota.Floor sessionThe woman was injured in January 1997 after she boarded a city bus to return to herEast Side home. As the woman walked to-ward an open seat, the bus slammed to a stopto avoid a collision. The sudden stop sent the woman toppling backwards, bouncing off the windshield, andlanding at the bottom of the steps inside thebus door. She spent five days in the hospitalwith a variety of injuries and has since en-dured weeks of physical therapy. Unfortunately, the woman had to absorb another blow when informed that the buscompany would not pay for any of her medi-cal expenses. That, she was told, was theresponsibility of the her own insurance com-pany. The state's no-fault insurance law requires that the woman's coverage come under herown automobile insurance policy. The new state law provides a remedy for people in such a situation without taking onthe highly controversial area of no-fault law. The law prohibits insurance companies from increasing a policyholder's premium ifthe person is involved in an accident while apassenger in a bus, taxi, or commuter van. According to Farrell, his constituent did not see an increase in auto insurance ratesafter the incident on the city bus, but the lawwill prevent anyone else in similar circum-stances from seeing a rate hike. HF1045*/SF759/CH64 LABOR Wage hike approved Minnesota's minimum-wage workers would get a pay increase under a bill ap-proved by the House May 8 on a vote of 76-56. HF892 , sponsored by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia), would raise the state's mini-mum wage for employees of large businesses(those with gross sales over $500,000 annu-ally) to $5.40 per hour on Sept. 1. Workers atsmall businesses would have to be paid atleast $5.15. Currently in Minnesota, there are three separate minimum wage levels. Businesseswith more than $362,500 in annual salesmust pay their workers at least $4.25 anhour, while companies with lesser sales mustpay a minimum of $4 per hour. A federallymandated minimum wage of $5 per houraffects only businesses with annual grosssales of more than $500,000. The federallevel will increase to $5.15 on Sept. 1, 1997. Rukavina characterized HF892 as a small gesture of support for Minnesota's workingclass and, in light of the recent welfare re- form legislation requiring recipients to work,necessary to sustain a decent standard ofliving. The bill, he said, would put nearly$500 into the pocket of someone holdingdown a minimum-wage job. He also compared the increase to another bill now before the Legislature that wouldraise the pay of many of Minnesota's judgesand state agency executives. \"I think that we should certainly make a commitment here today,\" Rukavina said.\"Certainly the lowest paid workers in Min-nesota deserve a raise.\" Opponents of the bill argued that the free market, not the state, should determinewages. Indeed, said Rep. Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) the increased wage under HF892 could hardly be termed a \"livable wage.\" \"The fact of the matter is,\" Sviggum said, \"it's not the role of the government to deter-mine what the wage level is.\" During the course of debate on the floor, several members pointed out that Gov. ArneCarlson will most likely veto HF892 . Carlson vetoed similar legislation in 1994 and 1996. The bill now goes to the Senate. Electing the Met Council A bill that would transform the Metro- politan Council into an elective body passedthe House May 6 on a vote of 68-62. The Metropolitan Council, created in 1967, is responsible for comprehensive re-gional planning for the seven-county metro-politan area. One of the largest regionalgovernments in the nation, it also overseesthe regional bus system, several wastewatertreatment facilities, and Metro Mobility, atransit operation serving the disabled. It hasan annual budget of about $360 million,which is partially paid by property taxes, andmanages about 3,500 employees. The coun-cil is governed by a board of 17 membersappointed by the governor, each represent-ing a different portion of the metro region. \"The Metropolitan Council is the second largest unit of local government in the state\"after Hennepin County, said Rep. MyronOrfield (DFL-Mpls), the bill's sponsor. Hesaid that when an official body has as muchauthority as the council, it should be andusually is elected. \"Taxation without repre-sentation is fundamentally contrary to ourconstitution .\" Under HF423 , Metropolitan Council elec- tions would be nonpartisan and public fund-ing provided for qualified candidates.

Other amendments set limits of campaign spending for Met Council offices, set up aMetropolitan Policy Advisory Committee,and set 1996 as the council's tax levy baseyear. Several other amendments failed, includ- ing one from Rep. Marty Seifert (R-Marshall)to limit campaign contributions from non-citizens to Met Council candidates. Underquestioning, Seifert said that his amend-ment was trying to be proactive in responseto the foreign contribution scandal at thefederal level. \"We don't have to wait until thedefecation hits the fan to take action,\" Seifertsaid. The amendment failed on a 68-62 vote.HF423 now goes to the Senate. (See March 21, 1997, Session Weekly, page 12, and March 28, 1997, Session Weekly , page 15.) In recognition of Holocaust RemembranceWeek, Rabbi Joseph A. Edelheit, of TempleIsrael, held Torah scroll No. 248 from theCzech Memorial Scroll Trust as he led a prayeron the House floor May 5. The scroll, whichsurvived the holocaust, is from Tabor,Bohemia, where all people of Jewish heritagewere killed.Holocaust rememberance TRANSPORTATION Travel time slashed Speed limits would increase on Minne- sota interstates and divided highways under a bill awaiting action from Gov. Arne Carlson. The proposal calls for speed limits to jump from 65 mph to 70 mph on rural interstates,from 55 mph to 65 mph on metropolitanarea interstates, and from 55 mph to 65 mphon four-lane, divided highways throughoutthe state. However, the bill would leave the speed limit at 45 mph on a piece of Interstate 35Estretching from Interstate 94 south to Sev-enth Street in St. Paul. The proposed speed limit hikes are in- cluded in a bill ( HF458/SF724* ) sponsored by Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar). TheHouse approved a bill May 5 by a margin of120-13. Last year, lawmakers moved to boost the speed limit to 65 mph on rural, dividedhighways, but Gov. Arne Carlson blockedthe increase by ordering the commissionerof transportation to maintain the current 55 mph limit on such roads. The current proposal would void that or- der, reinstating the speed limit increase ap-proved by the Legislature last year. And thebill would add new increases. Carlson has said that he will not allow an increase in speed limits unless it is accompa-nied by additional funding to hire more statetroopers to tighten up enforcement. Juhnke'sbill does not include any such funding, but itcould be included in separate legislation be-ing considered this session. Juhnke's bill is not the first speed limit increase to be approved by the House thisyear. In early April, House members passeda separate bill ( HF1540 ) calling for a jump in speed limits, but it stalled in the Senate. The earlier bill would have increased the speed limit on a stretch of Interstate 35E inSt. Paul that has become known as the \"prac-tice freeway\" because of its 45 mph limit. After years of controversy over whether to build the stretch of highway, the debateshifted to the speed allowed on the road afterit was completed in the late 1980s. Critics of the 45 mph limit argue it is unnecessary and largely ignored by motor-ists, but supporters claim the lower limit wascrucial to the agreement to complete con-struction of the freeway and keeps noiseTitle transfers Car buyers who fail to promptly transfer the title on the vehicle would face new pen-alties, under a bill passed May 5 by the House.The vote was 132-0. The bill ( HF609/SF1404* ), sponsored Rep. Ron Erhardt (R-Edina), would clampdown on violators of state law regarding titletransfers. Some car buyers do not transfer the title on a vehicle for a variety of reasons, Erhardtsaid. For example, the buyer may not want topay for insurance or may not have a driver'slicense. (State law requires proof of insur-ance and a valid driver's license in order toobtain a title.) To get around the law, some illegal drivers buy cheap used cars with plenty of time lefton the tabs and do not follow title transferrequirements. When a title is not transferred, problems can arise for car sellers, who may be heldliable for parking tickets or other infractionsoccurring after the vehicle has been sold. Currently, it is a misdemeanor for a buyer to fail to apply for a title transfer within 14days of acquiring a vehicle. The bill wouldgive buyers just 10 days to apply for a titletransfer and to pay the necessary fees. The Department of Public Safety would suspend the registration on the vehicle if thebuyer does not transfer the title within 10days of the sale, under the bill. If the vehicle registration is suspended, the buyer would have to pay an additional $5reinstatement fee along with the normal titletransfer charges. If after 14 days the buyerstill has not transferred the title, an addi-tional $2 late fee will be applied. Also, law enforcement officers could im- pound a vehicle if the registration has beensuspended because the buyer failed to trans-fer the title. The bill now goes to the Senate. Correction The May 2, 1997, Session Weekly reported that seniors, like the disabled,currently receive free fishing licenses. Freesenior fishing licenses were eliminated bythe 1994 Legislature. Seniors pay adiscounted rate of $4.50 for their licenseinstead of the $14 fee. People withdisabilities do receive their fishing licensesfree of charge.levels down in surrounding neighborhoods. Under Juhnke's bill, the limit would re- main at 45 mph on the approximately four-mile segment of Interstate 35E.

Gallagher A couple of years ago, in the kitchen of one of Minnesota's correctional facilities, a fightbroke out among several inmates. In theensuing melee, one of the prisoners foundhimself on the business end of a frozen porkchop taken up as a weapon by one of thecombatants. Unfortunately, the handsome young pris- oner, who had hoped to pursue a career inmodeling upon his release from the big house,got his face cut in the brawl, thereby dashingany dreams he had of earning a living on thestrength of his good looks. So, like hundreds of other inmates who suffer property losses or on-the-job injurieswhere the state may be responsible, he fileda claim (based on a loss of future income)with the Minnesota Legislature's JointHouse-Senate Subcommittee on Claims. The subcommittee, said clerk D'Ann Knight, did not compensate \"Pork ChopCharlie,\" as he came to be known to claimspersonnel. \"Ninety percent of the claims come from inmates,\" Knight said, adding that she pro-cesses about 200 of them a year. \"We'resometimes called the Court of Last Resort.\" Some of the claims, she said, seek com- pensation for injuries suffered by prisoners,conditionally released inmates, or patientsat state hospitals who work in a communityservice program. The vast majority, though,come from prisoners for lost or damagedproperty. The subcommittee, Knight said, will not hear any claims with a value of less than $10. \"It's amazing, though, how many claims I get that are right around $11,\" she said. Randy Hartnett, the Department of Cor- rections' assistant claims officer, said an in-mate starts the process by filing a claim at theinstitution. The majority of them, he said,have some validity and are paid by the facil-ity. \"After all,\" Hartnett said, \"we have thou- sands of inmates who have tens of thousandsof pieces of property that are moved thou-sands of times, and sometimes things do getlost or damaged.\" Hartnett reviews those claims the institu- tion denies, and if he denies it also, writes aletter to the prisoner explaining why. At thatpoint, he said, the inmate can bring the claimbefore the legislative subcommittee. Claimsover $2,500 automatically go to the subcom-mittee.Claims subcommittee . . . Disgruntled folks seek pay from joint panel It used to be, Hartnett said, that inmates could file a claim for free, but in 1994 theLegislature attached a $5 fee to the process. Ifthe claim is upheld, the fee is returned. \"I think what that did is eliminate a lot of the specious claims,\" he said. Of course, not all claims come from pris- oners. For example, Knight said, several years ago, a number of state employees \u2014 andlegislators \u2014 filed claims after the gate at theState Office Building's parking garage mal-functioned and began closing before carshad cleared the gate path. At first, she said,the car owners contacted the Department ofAdministration about making good on thedamage, but the department refused becausethe consequences were not the result of anystate employee's action or inaction. The disgruntled automobile owners turned to the subcommittee for relief. \"Needless to say,\" Knight said, \"the sub- committee ordered the department to payit.\" Last year, the annual claims bill included $4,180 to a Grygla, Minn., individual whooverpaid tax on an airplane purchase in 1989and another $4,000 to a man who built auseless stone wall to prevent erosion basedon erroneous information from the Depart-ment of Natural Resources. The subcommittee, Hartnett said, alsohears claims from citizens who suffer dam- ages due to the actions of escaped prisonersor who feel they have been injured by thedepartment. In these cases, according to amemo issued by subcommittee counsel CraigLindeke (who is also an attorney in the Of-fice of the Revisor of Statutes), the group actsas a \"court of equity\" and is not bound bylegal or procedural rules. Instead, the memosays, the subcommittee pays claims \"if rulesof fundamental fairness requires it.\" Members of the 80th Legislature's claims subcommittee, which meets seven or eighttimes a year to hear cases, have yet to benamed. \"I hear they'll be named after the session,\" Knight said.

Open heartsurgery, pacemakers, artificial heart valves,organ and bone marrow transplants all werepioneered here. The state is home to world-renowned medical institutions such as theMayo Clinic, University of Minnesota Medi-cal College, Abbott-Northwestern Hospital,and Medtronics. It hasn't always been this way. When the Minnesota Territory was first settled by non-natives, a variety of unregulated health carepractices were common. Euro-pean immigrant and NativeAmerican families shared andpracticed traditional folk medi-cine handed down for genera-tions in their respective cultures.On the other end of the spec-trum were allopathic, homeo-pathic, and eclectic physicianstrained at various East Coast andEuropean colleges and universi-ties. In between were all mannerof bone-setters, snake oil huck-sters, and self-proclaimed \"doc-tors.\" Various surgeons served with the U.S. Army at Fort Snelling,but the first trained private prac-titioner is thought to be Dr.Christopher Cork. A graduate ofthe University of Heidelberg,Cork set up practice in a tama-rack log house on the banks ofthe St. Croix River in 1841. Dr.John Jay Dewey, the first physi-cian to call St. Paul home, hungout his shingle in 1847. By 1851, there were 11 trained allopathic doctors in the state.The term allopathy is applied tostandard medical practice as weknow it today. It is the treatmentof disease by medicines that pro-duce effects opposite of thoseproduced by the disease. In 1853,the allopaths organized themselves into theMinnesota Medical Society, a forerunner oftoday's Minnesota Medical Association. One of the reasons Minnesota's early allo- pathic practitioners had trouble establishingthemselves was that their profession hadlargely lost public confidence. While allopa-thy had made great strides in the scientificunderstanding of human anatomy and dis-Health care history . . . State medical licensing follows public's pocketbooks ease pathology in the 1700s and early 1800s,the therapies it offered, such as bloodlettingand the administration of toxic medicines,did more harm than good. When a medicaldoctor appeared at a patient's door, the GrimReaper often followed. Allopaths, homeopaths in harmony Homeopathy, another major branch of medicine practiced in early Minnesota, wasmore popular with the public. Homeopathyis based on the idea that diseases are cured bygiving very small doses of drugs, which in ahealthy person and in large doses would produce symptoms like those of the disease. The big advantage of homeopathy was that,even when ineffective, the treatment at leastwas not harmful. Patients under homeo-pathic care had a higher survival rate and thepublic responded by flocking to homeopathicdoctors. Public revulsion against allopathic treat- ments had caused many states to repeal alllaws restricting other medical practitioners by the 1850s. When Minnesota became astate in 1858, no medical regulation wasincluded in the state's laws. In addition to allopaths and homeopaths, there were a few eclectic physicians whoformed their own medical society in 1861.The eclectics borrowed freely from all schoolsof thought, using herbal, homeopathic, andallopathic cures to treat their patients. Presentday naturopathy has been called \"the neweclectic medicine.\" Relations between Minnesota's allopathic and homeopathic physicians both con- tentious and cooperative. In theirrespective professional journals,they criticized each other's medi-cal theory and practice. But inthe real world of patient treat-ment, individual doctors bor-rowed freely from the otherschool's techniques, andallopaths and homeopaths oftenconsulted with each other. The first Minnesota medical law regulated not the practitioners,but those beyond the reach oftheir treatment. A bill passed in1875 allowed all legally consti-tuted medical colleges and asso-ciations to claim the bodies ofpersons buried at public expensefor purposes of dissection andstudy. Homeopaths, who had formed their own medical society in1867, attempted to pass statemedical regulations in 1870 and1875. They joined forces withthe allopaths in 1880 and a got abill through the Senate. But inthe confusion following the 1881State Capitol fire, the Housenever acted on the bill. The Minneapolis Homeopathic Hospital began taking in patientsin 1882 and the Minnesota Ho-meopathic Medical College opened in 1886 in Minneapolis. Finally in 1887, the state passed laws regu- lating medical practice and created the Min-nesota Medical Examiners Board to licenseand oversee physicians. Formal education The following year, the University of Minnesota founded its Medical Department. Beginning July 1, 1997, acupuncturists will need a license to practice inMinnesota. The state is an internationally recognized center for medicalinnovation, but it hasn't always been that way. When the MinnesotaTerritory was first settled by non-natives, a variety of unregulated healthcare practices were common.13 May 9, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYThe Minnesota Homeopathic Medical Col- lege was incorporated as a separate college ofmedicine alongside the allopathic medicalcollege. Both had identical curricula, buthomeopaths additional The university's homeopathic years and its graduates had a higher suc-cess rate in passing the state licensing examthan those from the allopathic college. Homeopathy's reluctance to improve its training standards in other states or to sub-mit to scientific testing left the professionopen to persistent criticism by the AmericanMedical Association throughout the 19thcentury. That, combined with dramatic im-provements in allopathic medicines andother therapies, led to a gradual decline inpublic interest in homeopathy. Theuniversity's homeopathic college was shutdown in 1909 when only three students en-rolled. The last meeting of the MinnesotaHomeopathic Medical Society was held in1923. Homeopathy was revived in the 1960s and is practiced today by private nonlicensedpractitioners, naturopathic doctors, and afew medical doctors and nurses. Due to theirnon-toxic nature, homeopathic remedies arewidely available without prescription. Theyare sold at health food stores and were re-cently added to the product line at Byerly'sgrocery stores. Founded in 1995, the Northwestern School of Homeopathy in Minneapolis now offers a36-month training program in classical ho-meopathy. The Minnesota HomeopathicAssociation was started this year with 15members and the goal of achieving legaldefinition and certification of homeopathicpractice in the state, said association presi-dent Valerie Ohanian. The association hopesto be included in the Legislature's delibera-tions about complementary medicine(See sidebar). Osteopathy gains equal status osteopathic medi- cine grew out of allopathy. Osteopathic doc-tors receive training similar to medicaldoctors but with a special emphasis on thebody's musculo-skeletal system. The firstosteopathic office in Minnesota was openedin Red Wing in 1894 by doctors Harry andCharlie Still, sons of osteopathy's founderAndrew Taylor Still. The state was in the middle of an epidemic of black diphtheria when the new doctorsarrived and they threw themselves into thebattle, helping many survive after local doc-tors had admitted defeat. The medical doc-tors were so upset that they had the StillsWhen the omnibus Health and Human Services bill ( SF1908 ) went to a conference committee this week, itcontained a $20,000 appropriation andother provisions to study the scope ofcomplementary medicine practiced inMinnesota. That provision was all that remained of a bill ( HF396/SF523 ) introduced this session to license and regulatenaturopathic doctors. The original bill wassponsored by Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Linda Berglin (DFL-Mpls)in response to a request from anaturopathic doctor, Helen Healy; andthe Minnesota Association ofNaturopathic Physicians. Last summer, the state Board of Medical Practice accused Healy of practicingmedicine without a license and soughtan injunction to stop her from doing so.Healy's practice includes treating clientswith herbal remedies, nutritionalcounseling, and massage, among othernatural and non-invasive techniques. Shehas practiced in St. Paul since 1983. The legal action taken against her prompted an outpouring of support forHealy from clients and other supportersof alternative medical care. The caseended in September when Healy and themedical board signed an agreementallowing her to continue providinnaturopathic consultation butprohibiting her from calling herself aphysician and, among other restrictions,requiring that she have each client signan informed consent form at least onceeach year. The bill would have provided state licensure and regulation for naturopathicdoctors under the auspices of the Boardof Medical Practice. Licensed naturopathswould have been required to complete afour-year degree in naturopathy at arecognized college and a two-yearinternship under a licensed practitioner.The bill passed the Senate Health andFamily Security Committee and evengained the support of the MinnesotaMedical Association, which hastraditionally opposed licensingnaturopaths. But when it reached theSenate Government Operations andVeterans Committee, all references tonaturopathy were deleted, leaving onlyprovisions for a study of complementarymedicine. Those provisions were laterincorporated into the omnibus HealthNaturopathic licensing . . . State to study complementary medical therapies and Human Services bill. This was the third recent attempt to license naturopaths in Minnesota.Previous bills had been introduced in1986 and 1993. From 1927 to 1974,naturopaths were able to legally practiceby simply registering with the state Boardof Healing Arts. Since then, they haveexisted in legal limbo. The complexity of medical licensing combined with dozens of committeehours devoted to welfare reform thissession pushed the naturopathic issue tothe back burner. In addition, legislatorsheard complaints from a variety of peoplewho have been practicing under the labelof naturopathy but who lack the four-year degrees that would have beenrequired for licensing under the bill.Lawmakers in both houses are promisingthat subcommittees will hold hearingson complementary medicine during theinterim this summer and fall. \"The irony for me is that the state is saying I can't practice without a licenseand yet they haven't set up a licensingprocedure,\" Healy said. Healy is one of six naturopathic doctors in the state that hold four-year degrees.\"Naturopaths don't come to Minnesotabecause it doesn't have licensure,\" Healysaid. Twelve other states, mostly on theeast and west coasts, do licensenaturopaths. Current state law permits only medical doctors and osteopaths to \"prevent ordiagnose correct or treat in any manneror by any means, methods, devices, orinstrumentalities, any disease, illness,pain, wound, fracture, infirmity, deformityor defect of any person\" except byauthority of the board. Healy said that definition is overly broad and could be construed to prohibita parent from giving their child vitaminsor to shut down weight-loss clinics. \"Theycould just remove that clause from thelaw and I would be safe,\" said Healy, whosaid her practice does not includepharmaceutical medicines or surgery. Massage therapists and Oriental body workers also came in for licensing thissession ( HF1135/SF1011 ) but their bill died in committee for many of the samereasons. They also will be included in thecomplementary medicine study andinterim hearings. \u2014S.C.arrested and jailed for practicing medicine without a license. But the brothers didn't stay behind bars for long. A noisy mob of people whose fami-lies had been helped by the osteopaths gath-ered around the jail demanding their release.The sheriff, fearing a riot, set the doctorsfree. From that day, the osteopaths wereescorted on their calls by two stalwart men,\"Big Ole\" and \"Little Ole\" Olson, whose children had been saved by the Stills. The Minnesota Osteopathic Medical So- ciety was founded in 1899 and is still activetoday. Legislation to license osteopathic phy-sicians first passed in 1909 and was expandedin 1923. With no school of osteopathy, thereare currently only about 150 osteopaths prac-ticing in Minnesota.14 SESSION WEEKLY / May 9, 1997Rise of complementary medicine Since the 1970s, public disenchantment with mainstream medicine has grown. As allopathicmedicine has evolved ever more miraculoushigh-tech diagnostic gadgets and invasive thera-pies, some patients have become more alien-ated from the medical mainstream.Increasingly, health consumers have turned toalternative healers for a more humanistic andholistic approach to their health needs. A 1993 study published in the New En- gland Journal of Medicine indicated that one- third of all Americans were using some formof alternative health care, spending a total of$14 billion annually, mostly out of their ownpockets. In the Twin Cities, a 1995 studyconducted by the health organization Allinarevealed that two-thirds of area householdshad used some form of alternative therapy inthe past two years. These studies have not gone unnoticed by the medical industry. Local health care pro-viders have responded by including acu-puncture, massage, chiropractic, nutrition,reflexology, biofeedback, meditation, herbaltherapy, and other alternatives along withmainstream medicine, in a mix that is nowbeing called complementary medicine.HealthPartners, Allina, HealthEast, andUnited Hospital all have recently incorpo-rated complementary therapies.The University of Minnesota has added alternative therapies to its medical schoolcurriculum and the College of St. Catherineis offering a 10-month course to bring healthcare professionals up to speed on the variouscomplementary models. With all of this change taking place, state regulation has some catching up to do. The most recent addition to medical li- censing in Minnesota was for acupunctur-ists. Since President Richard M. Nixonopened relations with China in the 1970s,there has been a growing interest in acu-puncture and traditional Chinese medicinein this country. This trend has been fed inMinnesota by the influx of East Asian immi-grants since the end of the Vietnam War. Chinese medical practice and theoretical development traces its history back 4,500years and is based on ideas about the flows ofbioelectrical energy in the body. Westernmedicine has accepted acupuncture for lim-ited purposes such as anesthesia and paintreatment. The Acupuncture Association of Minne- sota was founded in 1979 and approachedthe Department of Health about licensing in1980, according to Edith Davis, a foundingmember of the organization and presidentof the Minnesota Institute of Acupunctureand Herbal Studies. Fifteen years later, in1995, the Legislature approved licensure for acupuncturists under the state Board ofMedical Practice. That provision goes intoeffect on June 30 of this year. The acupuncture association currently has about 35 members and estimates there are70 trained acupuncturists in the state. Thatnumber has been fed by the 32 graduates ofthe Minnesota Institute of Acupuncture andHerbal Studies in St. Paul. Founded in 1990,the school offers a three-year program inacupuncture and an additional year cover-ing herbal therapies. The state Board of Medical Practice cur- rently licenses 14,423 physicians (both medi-cal and osteopathic doctors) to practice inMinnesota. The board consists of five publicmembers, 10 licensed medical doctors andone doctor of osteopathy. The board alsoregulates physical therapists, athletic train-ers, physicians assistants, respiratory carepractitioners, athletic trainers, and healthcare corporations. Chiropractic, perhaps the oldest alterna- tive therapy, has been licensed by its ownboard in Minnesota since 1919. Separatestate boards also govern licensing for nurses,optometrists, pharmacists, and podiatrists. U.S. SenatorsSenatorRod Grams BuildingWashington, D.C. (202) D.C.15 May 9, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYBy Nick Healy A Texas woman's garage sale bargain turned out to be a long lost memento of aformer speaker of the Minnesota House ofRepresentatives and a link to an unusualchapter in the history of the Legislature. Forty-two-year-old Mission, Texas, resi- dent Frances Wilson knew she had foundsomething valuable when she lifted a tar-nished platter from the table at a garage salenot far from her border-town home late lastyear. \"It was so heavy I said, 'Darn, I wonder what that is,'\" Wilson said. \"I looked at theback and it said sterling silver, so I knew itwould be at least worth its weight.\" Wilson paid the 50-cent asking price, took the platter home, and later began to scrubaway the thick layer of black that covered theentire piece. Armed only with a steel woolpad, Wilson cleaned away enough filth touncover the Minnesota state seal inscribedon the oval-shaped platter, along with a spe-cial message revealing its origin. \"Presented to the honorable H.H. Dunn, speaker of the House of Representatives, bythe members of the 37th session. 1911,\"reads the inscription. How did an 86-year-old gift to a Minne- sota politico find its way to a junk sale at theopposite end of the country? That remains amystery. Just who was Dunn? That is aninteresting story in its own right. \"He must have been a pretty important fellow,\" Wilson said. \"This is not a play-thing. This is a very valuable antique.\" Indeed, Howard H. Dunn did hold an important post in the Legislature, but he wassomething of a political oddity with a briefcareer marked by unusual entrances andexits. Dunn first came to the Legislature in 1897, when he assumed a Senate seat amid contro-versy. The seat in the upper chamber had be- longed to Frank A. Day, a Martin Countynewspaper publisher who held the positionof president pro tempore of the Senate. In January 1895, fresh from election to a four-year term, Day was elevated to lieutenantgovernor when Gov. Knute Nelson was chosento represent Minnesota in the U.S. Senate andhis second-in-command, David M. Clough,moved up to the governor's office. But Day did not want to relinquish his position in the Senate, and he continued toact as a member of the body.Minnesota statesman . . . Speaker Dunn's platter turns up tarnished in Texas to Dunn, a \"wet\" supported by the brewerylobby, and fellow Republican Joseph A.A.Burnquist, a \"dry\" backed by the Anti-Sa-loon League of Minnesota. \"[P]olitical agents of the brewers were active in [Dunn's] behalf,\" according toDunn critic Lynn Haines in a review of the1911 session published that year. Dunn'sdetractors also claimed the \"brewery ma-chine\" extended generous political favors tothose who supported him. Dunn oversaw the House during the 1911 session and the special session of 1912, nei-ther of which produced significant legisla-tion favored by the prohibition movement. However, the 1911 session did produce important legislation of another variety. Thatyear, lawmakers passed a measure abolish-ing capital punishment in the state. Dunn returned to the House for the 1913 session, but by then the tide had turned infavor of the progressives within his party. Hedid not seek another turn as speaker, nor didhe seek re-election to the House the follow-ing year. For now, the sterling silver platter given to Dunn at the height of his atypical politicalcareer remains in the hands of an amateurantique and cookie jar collector in Texas. Wilson said she would like to see the plat- ter returned to Minnesota, but she wants afair price for the piece. She is hoping to get$2,500 for the platter, although an antiquedealer told her it could be worth as much astwice that. \"When you know you've got an antique and you know it's worth something, youdon't want to give it away,\" Wilson said. She contacted the Minnesota Historical Society in December 1996, and was told totake a picture of the platter and mail it inalong with a letter indicating the asking price.The historical society would have to con-sider the historical value of the platter and anacquisitions committee would have to de-cide in favor of purchasing it before any dealcould be completed. Wilson said she is still planning to send the necessary information to the historical soci-ety, but in the meantime, she is open to otheroffers. \"I know it would be worth more to the people of Minnesota than it is to the peopleof Texas,\" Wilson said. Former Speaker of the House H. H. Dunn Photo courtesy Secretary of State's Legislative ManualAt the opening of the 1897 session, Day arrived to take his seat, but Dunn, who waspracticing law in Fairmont, Minn., at thetime, also was there, with a certificate ofelection in hand and prepared to take theoath of office. After some debate, the Senate decided that Dunn was rightly entitled to the seat. Heserved the remaining two years of Day'sterm, but Dunn then left politics for morethan a decade. (The Minnesota SupremeCourt later rejected the Senate's decision,but the ruling came after the conclusion ofthe 1897 session.) Dunn's name did not show up on a ballot again until 1910, after he had moved his lawpractice to Albert Lea, Minn. He was electedto the House as a Republican, and the 44-year-old managed the now-unthinkable featof becoming speaker in his first term in thelower chamber. Various accounts of Dunn's climb to the speaker's chair agree that his selection forthe job was very much a product of theuncertain political times. The Legislaturewas dominated by Republicans then, butmembers of the party were hardly unified. Many had followed the progressive lead of Theodore Roosevelt, but others were moreconservative defenders of the status quo.The temperance movement also producedsharp lines of separation. The fight for the speakership came down16 SESSION WEEKLY / May 9, 1997 So far 2,200 bills have been introduced during the 1997 Legislative Session.

Kelly-DFL21 May 9, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYHF Vetoed Signed Description CH SFTracking the Bills . . . May 2 - May 8, 1997 Once a bill has passed both the House and the Senate in identical form, it's ready to besent to the governor for consideration. Thegovernor has several options when consid-ering a bill. The governor can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which results in the bill becom- ing law in the first year of the biennium. The timing of these actions is as significantas the actions themselves. In the first year of the biennium, the im- portant thing to remember is that the gover-Bills await governor's action nor has three days from the time of \"present-ment\" to veto a bill. If the governor doesn'tsign the bill within this time frame, it willbecome law with or without his signature.(Sundays are not counted in the three-daytime limit, but holidays are.) Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to eliminatethe appropriation items to which he objects.As with all vetoes, the governor must includea statement listing the reasons for the vetowith the returned bill. Here, too, the time-table is within three days after the governorreceives the bill. A two-thirds vote of the members in eachhouse is needed to override a veto.

Royce Hanson's 1989 book, Tri- bune of the People:The Minnesota Legis-lature and Its Leadership , provides a look at the Legislature during the 1980s andoffers a historical perspective. But thebook also reveals how much things havechanged in just 10 years. Back then, for example, House mem- bers could eat and drink at their deskswithout restraint. Today, they use re-straint. But there are other fundamental changes that have forever altered theway lawmakers \u2014 and the lawmakingprocess \u2014 works. Until the 1970s, only the speaker and majority leader had private offices. Eachmember's desk on the House floorserved as his or her office, where theyoften met with constituents. In 1963,House Speaker Lloyd Duxbury closedthe floor to visitors an hour before ses-Do you know? sion \"to give members a little time freeof interruptions,\" Hanson writes. Backthen, formality was seen as obstructingexpedience. Today, it's likely to be seenas promoting it. Instead of the army of highly trained research analysts who today help draftmost bills and attend every committeehearing, in the 1970s \"there was noprofessional staff to assist members indrafting bills, conducting research, orserving constituents.\" Members usedtelephones from a bank in the hallwayoutside the chamber and shared a com-mon secretarial pool. The revisor's of-fice \u2014 which makes sure every bill sayswhat it means and means what it saysin the proper legalese \u2014 was adjacentto the Supreme Court. Today, the of-fice and its 56 employees sit atop theState Office Building, and cover theentire seventh floor. But perhaps the biggest change hasbeen in the lawmaking task itself, which has grown progressively more complexand the pace more frenzied since ses-sions became annual events with a 1972constitutional amendment. In the 1960s, when members met for three or four months every two years,legislative service could be viewed \"as aregular but minor invasion of their worklife,\" even for leadership. Today, mem-bers are more likely than ever before toconsider legislative service a primary ca-reer. In Hanson's book, the age of the \"citi- zen legislature\" was thought to be on thewane. It cited many retiring memberswho left the Legislature because of theincreased workload and modest pay. That trend may be continuing. In 1963, no House member professed to be a full-time legislator, the same as in 1973. In1983, 11 said they were; today, 18 makethat claim.23 May 9, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYFriday, May 2 HF2186\u2014Kalis (DFL) Capital InvestmentBonding bill authorizing spendingto acquire and better public landand buildings, capital improvementsprovided, bonds issued and moneyappropriated.

At atime long forgotten, some teacher thought the trek to see government in action wasa worthy activity; the plan soon spread to schools across the state. Now, during theclosing days of the legislative session, the descent upon the Capitol can be over-whelming for those who work in the building, but it's satisfying to know that a uniquelearning experience is in progress. Some visiting sixth-graders were students from Plainview Elementary near Rochester, and schools in the towns of Amboy, Brainerd, Blue Earth, Le Sueur, Menahga, Osakis, andas far as Blackduck. In April 1997, 16,183 lively grade schoolers arrived by the yellowbusloads, while another 22,000 eager youth will visit by the end of May. Upon arrival, the grade schoolers bound up the 40 majestic granite steps of the statehouse where they are greeted on the first level by one of the 21 spirited tourguides. These dedicated souls work for the Minnesota Historical Society and greatlyenjoy showing off the state's crown jewel of all its buildings. The rotunda in the center of the 434-feet long edifice is their first stop on the whirlwind 45-minute tour. Here visitors are shown the brass and glass L' Etoile du Nord (Star of the North) state symbol in the floor. Around the periphery are favorite relics for sixth-graders. These are the battle flags of past wars, including one carriedby the Minnesota 1st Regiment at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. Looking up, theschool children can see the magnificent six-feet tall crystal chandelier with 92 lightbulbs hanging from the inner dome, over 110 feet above their heads. ( See page 25.) The guides then take the exuberant visitors to the bust of Cass Gilbert, the visionary architect who designed the building. The guides note that Gilbert's use of 22 types ofmarble and other stone, and his strong sense of perspective, symmetry, and decorproduced an elaborate design of visual harmony surpassed by only a few buildings inthe country. Grade schoolers are led to and up a unique free-standing marble staircase designed by Gilbert. On the second level, or \"grand floor,\" they view the House and Senatechambers and move on to the Supreme Court ceremonial chamber on the east wingwhere, in past years, the ghostly likeness of a long since deceased Supreme Courtjustice was often sighted! Another quick side trip takes the group to the third level ( see cover ) past the painting of a man with six toes; they climb a long flight of hidden stairs; then walkoutside to get a close-up view of the highlight of their trip \u2014 the Golden Horses \u2014some 104 feet above street level. Many sixth-graders may not return to this priceless piece of history but they will remember how the guides, the lawmakers, and staff they met talked about CassGilbert and the Minnesota State Capitol with praise and wonderment. \u2014LeClair G. Lambert3 May 16, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYWeek in Review . . . May 8 - 15, 1997 Highlights By F.J. Gallagher Minnesota teenagers should smoke 'em if they've got 'em, because under legislationpassed by the House May 15, it will be a lotharder for youth to buy cigarettes. \"The one missing element in our law so far has been the responsibility of the retailer,\"HF117 sponsor Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL- New Hope) said of the bill, which passed 86-46. \"The retailers have been noticeablyabsent.\" HF117 , Rest said, would bring the retail- ers into the regulatory fold. The bill wouldrequire communities to license tobacco sell-ers and conduct at least one compliancecheck, or \"sting\" operation, on each licenseholder every year. In a \"sting,\" someonebetween the ages of 15 and 18 years oldwould attempt to purchase cigarettes ille-gally under the direct supervision of theauthorities. The bill also prohibits the sale of cigarettes from vending machines, except for those inlocations \u2014 such as a bar \u2014 where peopleunder 18 are not allowed. It also bans theopen display of single packages of cigarettesor smokeless tobacco in stores, except forthose that derive at least 90 percent of theirrevenue from tobacco sales. Under HF117 , cigarette manufacturers would be required to disclose whether theirproduct contains ammonia, arsenic, cad-mium, formaldehyde, or lead. The bill also spells out a number of admin- istrative penalties that would be imposed onlicensees and store clerks convicted of sellingtobacco products to a teenager, in additionto similar provisions that would apply to theminor who attempted the purchase. Any license holder convicted of a first offense would draw a $75 fine. A secondoffense within a two-year period would costthe retailer $200 and the third offense withinthe same period would warrant a $250 pen-alty, plus a seven-day suspension of the to-bacco license. The clerk who sold the tobacco would receive a $50 civil fine. (Clerks already faceup to a year in jail and a $3,000 criminalpenalty for selling tobacco to a minor.)Youth and tobacco . . . Penalties target sales to minors, punish retailers Any juvenile found to have illegally pur- chased tobacco \u2014 a petty misdemeanor un-der the law \u2014 could receive a fine of up to$100, a community service sentence, proba-tion, or be required to participate in sub-stance abuse programs. If the minor used adriver's license to commit the act, the licensewould be suspended for 90 days. The proposal explicitly states that local governments may pass ordinances that aremore strict than HF117 . The bill would re- quire tobacco retailers affected by such aproposal to be notified 30 days prior to anymeeting on the possible changes. Last session, a bill to limit youth access to tobacco was derailed by the same issue. Afterthe House rejected a provision that wouldhave prohibited local units of governmentfrom enacting tobacco sales ordinancestougher than those contained in the bill, itwas pulled by its author and never resur-faced. So-called \"pre-emption\" laws of vary-ing strengths already are on the books inmore than two dozen states. Although the HF117 ultimately passed, its A bill targeting youth access to tobacco passed the House May 15. The proposal would require communities to license tobacco sellers and conduct at least one compliance check, or \"sting\"operation, on each license holder every year. It also would \u2014 for the first time \u2014 punish store ownersfor tobacco sales to minors. Clerks and the buyers would face new fines as well. approval was by no means a certainty. Manymembers rose to speak against the bill. \"How many people are we going to turn into criminals over a lousy cigarette?\" askedRep. Mike Osskopp (R- Lake City). Indeed, HF117 narrowly avoided being sent back to the conference committee thatgenerated the version accepted by the House.A motion to reject the committee's reportknotted the House on a 66-66 vote, and themeasure failed. The Senate must now adopt the confer- ence committee's report, before the bill canbe sent to Gov. Arne Carlson to be signedinto law or vetoed. Gubernatorial spokesman Brian Dietz said Carlson has not yet taken a position on thebill. Look for a preliminary wrap up of the 1997 session in next week's issue of Session Weekly .4 SESSION WEEKLY / May 16, 1997ELECTIONSDWI Pillows talk at the polls People in some areas of Minnesota might want to carefully plan which room of thehouse should be the master bedroom. Thedecision could determine the location oftheir polling place. According to a bill passed by the House May 6, if an individual's home lies in morethan one precinct, the \"official\" one wouldbe \"the precinct in which a majority of theroom in which the individual usually sleepsis located.\" The provision has become necessary as more housing developments are being builton agricultural land which also serves tomark school district boundaries, accordingto Joe Mansky, director of the Elections Di-vision of the Office of the Secretary of State.No figures are available to determine theDWI bill clears House House members voted May 12 in favor of a bill intended to save lives by getting tougheron alcohol-impaired drivers. The bill passed98-35. Sponsored by Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), the most contested provision inHF1004/SF985* would lower the legal alco- hol limit from the current 0.10 percent to0.08 percent. \"We know we'll reduce the number of people in Minnesota who will die from drunkdrivers,\" said Rep. Doug Swenson (R-ForestLake), adding that states that have loweredthe limit have reduced alcohol-related traf-fic fatalities by 16 percent. He said that medi-cal evidence shows many driving-relatedskills are affected at 0.08 percent, includingsteering, braking, and speed control. Rep. Tom Rukavina (R-Virginia) said the bill will render otherwise lawabiding peoplecriminals and cost the state large sums toarrest and prosecute drivers. \"Quit doingbad things to good people,\" he said. Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) said that the bill was \"overkill\" and offered an amend-ment to apply the 0.08 percent limit to repeatoffenders only. Entenza said that drivers who cause alco- hol-related fatalities are overwhelminglyfirst-time offenders. Bishop's amendmentfailed on a 68-65 vote. The bill's other major provisions would increase penalties for drunken driving, in-crease restrictions on teen drinking and driv-ing, apply drunken driving restrictions toboats, increase the use of electronic alcoholmonitoring for violators, and increase finesand penalties for driving with a blood alco-hol content of 0.20 percent or higher. As presented on the floor, the bill would have applied a 0.04 percent blood alcohollevel to drivers under 21 years old. Rep.Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) successfullyoffered an amendment that would apply the0.04 provision to 16-18 year olds only. Whilestate law prohibits alcohol consumption bypeople under 21, the provision will lower thethreshold at which DWI penalties will applyto young drivers. The House also removed a provision that would have limited a suspect's right to re-quest additional testing to determine bloodalcohol content. Last year in Minnesota police made 38,900 DWI arrests, a significant jump from theyear before, when 33,355 arrests were made,according to Alan Rodgers of the Minnesota Department of Public Safety. A House Research Department report states that based on studies of other states,the lower level could save about 14 livesevery year in Minnesota and about $6.3 mil-lion in associated social costs. If the bill becomes law, Minnesota will join 10 other states and nine countries with0.08 limits. Seven countries set the limit atbelow 0.08. The House research report states that the new limit would mean that a 175-poundman could drink three drinks per hour withinthe legal limit; the fourth would exceed it. A130-pound woman could drink two drinks,but would reach a blood alcohol level of0.077, bringing her closer to the limit than aman would be at three drinks. Other factors will make a difference, such as the amount of food people eat and howquickly they drink. Other provisions would apply a \"not a drop\" standard to school bus drivers, whowould risk permanent job disqualification iffound to have any alcohol in the blood streamwhile driving a bus. Current law sets thelimit at 0.04 percent. Further, the cost to have a driver's license reinstated after a suspension or revocationfor any traffic offense would be increasedfrom $20 to $25.25. For people convicted ofDWI, the current $260 fee would remain thesame. The bill will be heard next in a conference committee.number of people the provision would af- fect. The bill ( HF127/SF72* ), sponsored in the House by Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins), passed on a 123-8 vote. In addition to many technical changes, the bill would require courts to provide thesecretary of state's office with the names ofconvicted felons (who are ineligible to vote),and of those whose voting rights have beenrestored after having served sentences forfelony crimes. The state currently has norecord-keeping capacity to keep track of suchconvicts. The bill also provides that all candidates for county sheriff must be licensed peaceofficers. Under current law, candidates areobligated only to complete basic police train-ing courses before serving or running. The bill now goes to the governor. Caucuses: lowering the age Many laws directly affect the lives of mi- nors, but only people 18 and older have a sayin their making. HF703/SF1170* , sponsored by Rep. Andy Dawkins, (DFL-St. Paul) would open part ofthe elections process to 17-year-olds. Thebill passed the House May 14 on a 68-64vote. Under the proposal, anyone who is 17 years old at the time of precinct caucusescould participate as a delegate or voter. Thebill stipulates that the young people must beenrolled in school at the time of the caucusand live within the precinct. \"This is a babystep toward voting,\" Dawkins said. \"We'renot going to open the general elections to 17-year-olds.\" The change would be at the option of the local political party organizing the caucus.\"The bill doesn't make it mandatory, butpermits each local unit of government tochoose whether it wants to open the caucus\"to certain minors, he said. \"The best reasonI can give for the bill is that we really need tohave a cross-generational dialogue about thedemocratic process.\" Dawkins said the measure is a way to encourage and nurture the interest of youngpeople in the political process. The bill now returns to the Senate. Need to find out who represents you at the Capitol? Call the House Public Information Office at (612) 296-21465 May 16, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Campaign limits The House passed a bill May 13 that would add to and clarify limits on campaign contri-butions. The vote was 128-3. In addition to existing law which prohib- its candidates from collecting more than$300 in contributions from any one sourceduring an election year, the new languageadds that a candidate's committee is underthe same prohibition. (For candidates whoseterritory has more than 100,000 people, thelimit is $500.) Previous law did not specifythat committees were subject to the limits.The change is intended to control the influ-ence of special interests on elected publicofficials. In floor action, the bill was amended to add that legislators who are running for otheroffices, whether local or federal, may notsolicit or accept contributions from lobby-ists during a regular session of the Legisla-ture. HF1463/SF1255* , sponsored in the House by Rep. Mark Mahon (DFL-Bloomington),is now headed for conference committeedebate. ENERGY ENVIRONMENT Looking down from the second floor of the Capitol rotunda, master weaver BounxouChanthraphone, of Minneapolis, talked with visitors as she worked at her loom May 9 duringAsian Heritage Month Day on the Hill.Weaving masterKeeping track of voters Under a bill passed by the House May 14, the U.S. Postal Service will provide the Of-fice of the Secretary of State with the namesof people who file permanent change of ad-dress orders. The secretary of state's officeand county auditors will use the data to keeptheir records current and to accurately directvoters to polling places.Biomass and wind power A bill passed by the House May 14 would remove a hurdle that energy-producing fa-cilities normally face before they can startdoing business. The vote was 111-20. The facilities in this case are wind and biomass plants. HF1508/SF1328* , sponsored by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls),would remove the requirement that the plantowners obtain costly and time-consumingcertificates of need \u2014 proof that the stateneeds the facility \u2014 before they can be built.The certificate process usually takes 18months to three years. According to Rep. Loren Jennings, (DFL- Harris), not only does the state want to en-courage the wind and biomass energyindustry, it has mandated that a major en-About once a month the postal service would provide the secretary of state's officewith the lists. The office would provide theinformation to county auditors, who wouldsend registered voters the location of theirnew polling places. The intent of the bill is to improve record- keeping as well as to encourage voting. About 25,000 Minnesotans change resi- dences each year. At present, the secretary ofstate's office has no way of tracking them. HF294/SF73* , sponsored by Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins), now heads back tothe Senate.ergy buyer in the state, Northern States Power Co. (NSP), purchase a specified amount ofenergy from those sources. That means with-out the new provision, the state would berequiring a certificate of need from the samebusiness the state already has mandated thatNSP buy from. The bill also gives the Public Utilities Com- mission regulatory authority over the biom-ass and wind energy purchases made by autility company. Lastly, the bill requires the Department of Agriculture to study funding mechanisms tomake biomass energy projects more viable.The study would look at tax exempt bonds,public and private financing, the develop-ment of an authority to facilitate invest-ment, and credit payments, according to thebill. As initially introduced by Kubly, the bill would have gone much further. The statewould have helped fund the Minnesota Agri-Power project, a public/private partnershipwhich Kubly said would have been the larg-est biomass energy project in the world. Theproject would have created a 75-megawattenergy-generating plant in Granite Falls,Minn. The energy would have been pro-duced by burning alfalfa stems and otherbiomass products to create a gas for fuel.Those provisions failed in committee. The bill now awaits the governor's signa- ture. Lottery environment funding The bill extending the state lottery's rev- enue dedication to the Environmental TrustFund now moves to the House floor follow-ing its May 15 approval by the House Rulesand Legislative Administration Committee. HF113 , sponsored by Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth), would extend thededication of 40 percent of net lottery pro-ceeds to the trust fund for environmentalprojects until the year 2020. Under the Min-nesota Constitution, that dedication is set toexpire in 2000. The bill also would allow upto 25 percent of the annual revenues depos-ited in the fund to be used for land acquisi-tion and development until 2020. According to a report from the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources(LCMR), the lottery has contributed $149million to the Environmental Trust Fundsince it began in 1991. The fund is currentlyworth about $140 million. The LCMRprojects it will reach $1 billion in assets by6 SESSION WEEKLY / May 16, 1997FAMILY Send e-mail comments regarding Session Weekly to: session@house.leg.state.mn.us We thank you for your input. The editors2016. To date, the trust fund has contributed approximately $60.5 million to 87 environ-mental projects. Forty more projects are pro-posed for 1998-99, which would increasetotal trust fund expenditures to about $81million. HF113 has had a long and torturous road through the legislative process this year.Changes made to the original bill led Mungerto withdraw the proposal on two occasions,stalling its progress for weeks. When the billreached the House Ways and Means Com-mittee last week, House Minority LeaderRep. Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon) introducedan amendment guaranteeing citizens \"theprivilege to take game and fish.\" Like the Munger bill, the Sviggum pro- posal would be a constitutional amendmentrequiring voter approval. Questioned about what problem his amendment would solve, Sviggum indicatedthat while hunting and fishing, some sportsenthusiasts have been accosted by animalrights activists seeking to interfere with theseactivities. Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Vir-ginia) added that trapping rights had beenrestricted by law in recent years. The Sviggum amendment was approved by the Ways and Means Committee May 14but was removed by the House rules com-mittee the next day. Sviggum said he introduced his amend- ment because he had been unable to get ahearing on the issue in the House Environ-ment and Natural Resources Committee,which Munger chairs. Munger promised May15 to give the hunting and fishing rightsproposal a hearing in his committee nextyear. HF113 now goes to the house floor. Early childhood funding New laws requiring welfare parents to work are expected to move another 12,500 Min-nesota children into day care over the nextfew years. To prepare for that onslaught, abill awaiting the governor's signature setsaside a record $200.4 million. The measure also would pay some parents to stay at home with their newborns for thefirst year of life. In all, the omnibus early childhood and family education bill ( HF2147*/SF1858 ) would spend $393.6 million over the state's1998-1999 two-year budgeting period. In addition to child care, the bill appropri- ates money for programs such as early child-hood education, community education, af- ter school programs, adult basic education,Head Start, food shelves, and homeless shel-ters. Sponsored by Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL- Park Rapids) and Sen. Pat Piper (DFL-Aus-tin), a compromise version of the bill passedthe House May 12 by a vote of 123-10, andthe Senate May 13 by a vote of 65-0. Providing the dollars for child care is in the state's best interest, lawmakers say. Un-der a new federal welfare law, states are pun-ished for not moving their welfare parents towork. Specifically, Minnesota could losemillions in federal aid. Logically, if Minne-sota expects its welfare parents to work, childcare assistance is essential. Part of the $200.4 million for child care \u2014 $99 million \u2014 would pay for the child careneeds of welfare parents now required towork under federal law. About $92.5 million would be placed into an existing program that helps low- andmoderate-income working families pay forchild care using an income-based, sliding-fee scale. There are currently about 5,600Minnesota families on a waiting list for theBasic Sliding Fee program. The money in thebill is expected to eliminate most, if not all,of the waiting list. The Basic Sliding Fee program has be- come a vital part of the state's effort to trimits welfare rolls. Without the program, thecost of child care can often push a working-poor family onto welfare. A portion of the money set aside for the Basic Sliding Fee program would pay for aprovision that encourages stay-at-homeparenting for some working-poor families.In effect, it would pay parents on the BasicSliding Fee child care program to stay athome with their child for the first year of life. Eligible families already would have had to qualify for the Basic Sliding Fee program.They'd receive 75 percent of the average costof licensed family home day care for aninfant in their county. The bill instructs theDepartment of Children, Families and Learn-ing to begin the program by July 1, 1998. Another $7.7 million in the bill would go toward child care development grants andwould be spent to encourage more people toenter the child care profession by offeringforgivable loans for course work and train-ing. A portion of the money also would beused to expand child care facilities. And finally, the remaining $1 million would be used to administer the programs. Below is a listing of some of the bill's highlights. A mandatory $5 monthly co-payment forfamilies using state-subsidized child care. Families with incomes between 75 and 100percent of the federal poverty level wouldbe required to make a $5 co-payment eachmonth, regardless of how many childrenthey have. For a family of two, 75 percentof the poverty level equals $7,957 and 100percent equals $10,610. The co-paymentswould increase based on income for fami-lies earning more than 100 percent of thepoverty level. $29.7 million over the two-year budgeting period would pay for a program that bringbabies and toddlers together with theirparents to learn about a child's emotional,physical, mental, and educational devel-opment. The Early Childhood Family Edu-cation (ECFE) program is a 23-year-oldprogram designed for children from birthto kindergarten and their parents. $2 million for a newly created early child- hood infant grant development program.It would provide money to local ECFEprograms that come up with creative waysto focus on infant development and aparent's role in stimulating and nurturingtheir infant's intellectual and emotionaldevelopment. $9.8 million would pay for after-school enrichment programs. Grants are providedto select neighborhoods so they may offerafter-school programs for 9- to 13-year-olds. The program's purpose is to reducejuvenile crime, school suspensions, andincrease student achievement. $37.5 million would pay for Head Start. Head Start is a federal/state program thatprovides low-income preschool childrenwith emotional, social, health, nutritional,and psychological services. $25 million would pay for adult basic edu- cation over the biennium. The programprovides educational opportunities foradults with low educational levels. Servicesinclude literacy training, work force edu-cation, and General Educational Develop-ment (GED) preparation. $2.5 million would pay for Minnesota food shelves. The increase is in anticipation ofan even greater demand on food shelvesthis spring when many of Minnesota's poorwill see a cut in their federal food stamps.7 May 16, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Ann Woods, of Minnesota Pipes and Drums May 15 played a bagpipe processional withmembers of the Minnesota Law EnforcementHonor Guard to open the House floor sessionand honor peace officers killed or woundedin the line of duty.Peace Officer Day GAMBLING HEALTH GOVERNMENTAll in good fun The House passed a bill May 12 that would let social organizations continue to host cardgames and distribute prizes without beingsubject to gambling restrictions. The votewas 119-12. HF613/SF566* , sponsored by Rep. Tom Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul), would allowtournaments or contests involving social \u2014 including cribbage, skat,sheephead, bridge, euchre, pinochle, gin, 500,smear, and whist \u2014 as long as the events donot provide direct financial benefit to thehost organization, and the sum of all prizesdoes not exceed $200. The games in questionare generally held at VFW posts, AmericanLegion halls, Moose and Elk lodges, Knightsof Columbus halls, and senior citizen cen-ters. Often, a fee is charged for participationin the games, and the winner or winners inthe games may win part of the door fee. \"As we've developed statutes and laws to prohibit illegal gambling, we've inadvertentlywiped out social card games,\" said Rep. MikeDelmont (DFL-Lexington), who chaired theSubcommittee on Gambling of the HouseRegulated Industries and Energy Commit-tee. He said the committee's task was to for-mulate a bill that would allow the games tocontinue without expanding gambling law. Another provision would increase by 5 percent the amount that organizations thathost legal gambling, such as bingo, can claimas expenses. Current law says that 60 percentof the gross profits from bingo and 50 per-cent from other legal gambling can be claimedfor expenses. The bill would raise the amountsto 65 percent and 55 percent, respectively. Lastly, the bill would ease up on owners of premises where illegal gambling has takenplace. Before the owner's permit could berevoked, the Gambling Control Board wouldhave to prove that the owner knew the un-lawful activity was going on. The bill now awaits the governor's signa- ture. Flood aid A new state law, effective May 7, provides $21 million in relief for victims of the flood-ing throughout Minnesota, but most law-makers agree the state eventually will have todo more. The law will draw funds from the state's $522 million budget reserve for flood reliefand will temporarily lift some bureaucratic regulations to ease relief efforts. Gov. ArneCarlson signed the measure May 6. Under the law, $20 million goes to the Department of Public Safety for distributionto counties, cities, and towns affected by theflood. The money can be used for costs asso-ciated with flooding, including their use asmatching funds to receive federal emergencyrelief aid. Another $1 million is earmarked to help state agencies deal with expenses related toflood relief efforts. A variety of state agency rules and fees will be waived to speed flood relief efforts. Thebill also will provide an adjustment in stateaid to help school districts affected by theflood. It's still unclear what the total price tag will be to clean up and repair the manyhomes, businesses, and schools damaged bythe disastrous flooding this spring along theMinnesota and Red rivers. Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison) and Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe (DFL-Erskine) sponsored the $21 million floodMinnesotaCare money cut Although a bill moving through the House would expand the number of people eligiblefor MinnesotaCare, a state-subsidized healthinsurance program for the poor, it may be anincrease in theory only. The House May 2 cut MinnesotaCare's funding in half. The vote was 125-6. Under the bill ( HF1441/SF1208* ), the 2 percent tax on hospitals, doctors, and otherhealth care providers used to pay forMinnesotaCare would be cut to 1 percent. That cut, according to bill sponsor Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls), would causeMinnesotaCare to be \"deeply in the red\" infour years. His proposal would have cut thetax to 1.5 percent. At 1.5 percent, Greenfield said, doctors and hospitals see a tax break, and there is stillenough money left over to welcome morepeople into the program. There's evenenough to create new prescription drug cov-erage for low-income seniors who need helpwith medication costs and earn less than$9,468 per year (or 120 percent of the federalpoverty level). As the bill now stands, he said, there's not enough money \u2014 not enough to welcomemore poor people, not enough for seniordrug coverage, and possibly not enough forthose currently on MinnesotaCare. It is esti-mated that MinnesotaCare would have an$89 million deficit by 2001 if current enroll-ment is not cut. Greenfield said he hopes to restore some of the cut when the bill goes to a conferencecommittee to work out differences betweenthe House and Senate versions. The Senatebill would cut the tax to 1.75 percent. Rep. Todd Van Dellen (R-Plymouth) spon- sored the amendment to cut the tax to 1percent and said that talk of impending dras-tic cuts to the program was simply untrue. A separate amendment by Rep. Kevin Knight (R-Bloomington) eliminated den-tists from the list of health care providersrequired to pay the MinnesotaCare tax. Basedon a 1 percent tax, that would slash about$30 million by 2001 from the program. MinnesotaCare is a state-subsidized in- surance plan created in 1992 to extend healthinsurance coverage to the uninsured. Theprogram serves about 97,000 people whopay premiums based on income and co-relief measure in the Legislature.

Currently, (de- pending on their income), single people,couples without children, and families withchildren younger than 21 are covered. Specifically, HF1441/SF1208* would af- fect single people and couples without chil-dren. It would increase the annual incomelimits of those two groups to 175 percent ofthe federal poverty level, or $13,807 for singlepeople and $18,567 for couples without chil-dren. The current income limit is 135 per-cent of the federal poverty level, or $10,651and $14,323, respectively. An additional12,000 people are expected to joinMinnesotaCare as a result of the expandedeligibility. But at the same time MinnesotaCare would welcome more poor people, it also would setan asset limit on new applicants. The pro-gram would be limited to families with lessthan $30,000 in assets and individuals withless than $15,000 in assets. The asset testwould exclude a home and personal itemsand is expected to eliminate some 4,000 to5,000 people from the program. Minimum wage hike By a vote of 90-43, the House passed leg- islation May 14 that would raise the pay ofMinnesota's minimum-wage workers. Under HF892 , the minimum wage for employees of large businesses (those withannual gross sales in excess of $500,000)would rise to $5.15 per hour. Workers atsmaller companies would have to be paid atleast $4.90 per hour. The bill would takeeffect Sept. 1. Currently in Minnesota, there are three separate minimum wage levels. Businesseswith more than $362,500 in annual salesmust pay their workers at least $4.25 anhour, while companies with lesser sales mustpay a minimum of $4 per hour. A federallymandated $5-per-hour minimum wage af-fects only those businesses with annual grosssales in excess of $500,000. The federal levelwill increase to $5.15 on Sept. 1. \"The fact of the matter is,\" Rukavina said of HF892 , \"this will bring an increase in wages to a number of Minnesotans.\" Several members who argued against HF892 pointed out that Gov. Arne Carlson will most likely veto the bill because it doesnot contain a tip credit that would allowemployers to count a portion of an employee'sgratuities toward the minimum wage. More-over, said Rep. Tim Pawlenty (R-Eagan),HF892 lacks a so-called \"opportunity wage.\"House members acknowledged the accomplishments of the Bloomington Jefferson High School State Academic Decathlon Champions after they were introduced by Rep.

The bill would have allowed displaced local government employees to remain withtheir original employer if the employees hadseniority rights under a union contract. Italso would have required that new serviceproviders hire \u2014 in order of seniority \u2014from those being laid off by the local govern-ment unit. \"This bill is nothing more than a state mandate dictating how local governmentsshould handle labor relations,\" Carlson wrotein his veto message. \"It mandates a series ofpersonnel policies which should be left tothe local management process or collectivebargaining.\" Carlson said the bill might have prevented the hiring of employees based on qualifica-tions and forced local governments to hiremore employees than needed.

Current state law requires that workers select a union through a secret ballot elec-tion process. In his veto message Carlson wrote that the bill would \"irreparably harm the relation-ship between public employees and man-agement.\" He added that \"the certification election process now in place ensures that publicemployees are guaranteed a fair procedurefree of intimidation and coercion when de-ciding upon their right to organize.

Arne Carlson struck down legislation May 13 thatwould have allowed Minneapo-lis to maintain its own licensingprogram for building contrac- tors and remodelers through 2005. The Legislature enacted a statewide li- censing procedure for contractors in 1991that supersedes the local requirements. TheMinneapolis program is set to expire in 2000. \"Any advantages of a distinct licensure program by Minneapolis are greatly out-weighed by the needless duplication inher-ent within such a parallel arrangement,\"Carlson wrote in a letter announcing hisveto decision. \"Moreover, a unique licen-sure program could give unfair advantage toa certain group of building contractors andremodelers.\" Minneapolis officials, including Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton, had testified beforethe House Commerce, Tourism and Con-sumer Affairs Committee that the state'slicensing procedure did not provide adequateprotection for residents, given the advancedage of much of the city's housing stock. The proposal was sponsored by Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. LindaHiggins (DFL-Mpls). HF970/SF868*/CH146 RETIREMENT Vetoed by the governorPension veto A largely technical bill ad- dressing the pensions of publicemployees from firefighters topipefitters was vetoed May 13by Gov. Arne Carlson. Carlson agreed that most of the bill, which exceeds 100 pages, addressed \"genuine needsand resolve[d] serious problems in the pen-sion and retirement policy area.\" But hecited four specific trouble spots with themeasure: First, the bill creates a problem by extend- ing state pension coverage to seasonal em-ployees of the Department of Revenue.Carlson said the move would cost the state$91,000 annually, and the bill provides nofunding; Second, it allows employees of the Minne- sota Zoological Garden, the Lola and RudyPerpich Center for Arts Education, and thestate academies for the blind and deaf todevelop individual retirement account plans, rather than have their pensions con-trolled by the Minnesota State RetirementSystem. Carlson said the move would \"de-stabilize the funding of defined benefitplans\"; Third, the bill moves certain control of appropriations relating to state police andfire aid from the Department of Revenueto the Department of Finance. Since therevenue department administers both pro-grams, the appropriation authority shouldremain there, Carlson said. And finally, it allows a part-time teacher in Minneapolis to make a lump sum backpayment to cover a period of time when noretirement contributions were made. Whileadmitting the provision held no cost forthe state, Carlson objected, saying it \"couldapply to many members and should bethoroughly examined before this policy iscreated.\" The proposal was sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. SteveMorse (DFL-Dakota). HF1129/SF995*/CH139 TRANSPORTATIONTECHNOLOGY Electronic signatures The House brought Minnesota businesses one step closer to the digital age May 14,approving a bill that would give electronicsignatures the full force of legal protection.The vote was 95-38. \"This is something that our banks and our insurance companies . . . and anybody who isgoing to compete known as the Minnesota electronic authentication act. HF56/SF173* , sponsored in the House by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) and modeledafter a law set to take effect in Washingtonstate in January 1998, allows for the fullauthentication of documents transmittedbetween computers. The process relies on aset of two cryptographic key codes builtaround one-of-a-kind mathematical formu-las known as algorithms. One key, held pri-vately by the user, encodes documents witha digital signature; the other is held in trustby a public certification authority and usedby recipients to verify an encoded document'sintegrity. The bill defines the rules of the digital authentication system and mandates thatthe secretary of state set up a transitionalpublic certification authority until privatesector firms, which would be licensed and regulated by the secretary's office, can step inand take over the verification process. HF56/ SF173* also spells out the range of liability assumed by the system's subscribers andprovides penalties for acts of fraud. Perhaps most importantly, Kahn said, the entire electronic signature system would re-main voluntary. Businesses would not berequired to participate. Moreover, the statewould not assume any financial burden be-cause the cost of doing business would beassumed by the private sector firms \u2014 whocould set whatever price the market couldbear \u2014 when they take over as certificationauthorities. Kahn estimated that July 1998 would be the earliest the system could go on-line. House members, though, did not approve the bill without questioning the degree ofsecurity provided by the encryption codes. \"With all the hackers we have out there, I'm a little concerned\" about the increasedpotential for fraud, said Rep. Peg Larsen (R-Lakeland). It seems, she continued, that every time a bold, new technological innovation comesalong, some ne'er-do-well rises to the chal-lenge and finds a way to beat the system. Other representatives felt the bill linked the process to technology that may be state-of-the-art today, but obsolete a couple ofyears from now. \"Couldn't we just wait and not jump too quickly?\" asked Rep. Jim Rostberg (R-Isanti),adding that perhaps a study of the issuemight be more prudent. Both concerns, Kahn said, would be ad- dressed by the private sector firms as theykeep abreast of the developing technology. HF56/SF173* awaits Gov. Arne Carlson's signature. Transportation bill passes The omnibus transportation finance bill was given final approval by the House May13. The vote was 100-30. The bill ( SF1881 ), which appropriates $3 billion in state dollars for roads, bridges,transit, aviation, and public safety over thenext two years, now goes to the governor. Funding for 29 additional state troopers was taken out in conference and is missingfrom the final bill. Gov. Arne Carlson hadrequested additional troopers in his trans-portation budget proposal. (Carlson refusedto enact a proposed speed limit increase last10 SESSION WEEKLY / May 16, 1997Signed by the governoryear because funding for new troopers wasmissing.) Also gone is a repeal of state authority to build toll roads. The Legislature created thetoll road authority only four years ago as apossible means to pay for the ever-rising costof highway construction, but has yet to useit. Rep. Tom Workman (R-Chanhassen),had wanted to remove the state's toll roadauthority out of concern that Highway 212in his district would be converted to a pay-to-drive road. A provision requiring that freeway mo- torists use the left lane only for passing wasalso removed in conference. (See April 18, 1997, Session Weekly , page 15 and April 25, 1997, Session Weekly , page 15.) Transit The Metropolitan Council, which runs the metropolitan area's public transporta-tion system, would receive $100.7 million.Of that money, $2 million would go to helppeople leaving welfare obtain work-relatedtransportation, and $34.6 million would goto Metro Mobility, which provides rides toapproximately 25,000 metropolitan-areapeople with disabilities. The bill also re-quires a study of coordinating public transitand school transportation in Minneapolisand St. Paul. A total of $27 million would go to assist transit programs in Greater Minnesota. Anadditional $925,000 is appropriated to helpeconomically disadvantaged people outsidethe Twin Cities Metropolitan Area withwork-related transportation. Road and bridge construction State road construction projects would re- ceive $1.6 billion for the next two years. Localroads would get $841.6 million in state aid. Public safety The bill calls for $102.9 million in spend- ing for the Minnesota State Patrol. (Thegovernor refused to enact a speed limit in-crease called for by lawmakers in 1996 be-cause funding for new troopers was missing.) Also included is $2.1 million for com- puter-aided dispatching and records man-agement, and $1.7 million to install videocameras in state patrol vehicles. Another$69.5 million would go to the department'sDriver and Vehicle Services Division overthe next biennium. Also, $2.6 million wouldgo to the Department of Public Safety andthe Minnesota Safety Council for variouspublic safety programs.Aviation The bill appropriates $36.3 million for air transportation programs, including $26 mil-lion for airport development and assistance.Other funds support the Civil Air Patrol andprovide general support for aviation in thestate. Railroads and waterways A total of $3.9 million would go to fund rail and water transportation. This includesa $1 million study to look at using existingfreight railroad corridors for a commuterrail service in the metropolitan area. Statewide testing Gov. Arne Carlson signed leg- islation into law May 12 that willrequire uniform, statewide test-ing of virtually all Minnesota pub-lic school students. The new law, effective May 13, will require uniform statewide testing ofthird-, fifth-, and eighth-graders beginningin the 1997-1998 school year and a newbrand of assessment of students at the highschool level beginning no later than the 1999-2000 school year. Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud), who sponsored the measure in the House, saidthe tests will be an integral part of the state'smove toward an education system that de-mands schools and students be more ac-countable for taxpayer funds invested ineducation. Statewide testing had been a controversial issue at the Capitol in years past, but this yearit drew bipartisan support. Proponents claimsuch testing would provide a reliable meansfor comparing the performance of schoolsand districts. The first law passed during the 1997 ses- sion ( HF1*/SF3/CH1 ) mandated that state- wide testing would begin during the1997-1998 school year. The latest statewidetesting law prescribes how that testing sys-tem will work. Under the law, the basic skills tests in reading and math \u2014 already required underthe state's graduation rule and first given tostudents in the eighth grade \u2014 will count asthe statewide tests for that age group. Third-and-fifth graders will be given tests selected by the Department of Children,Families and Learning. The department canuse a test it has developed or a nationally recognized test such as the CaliforniaAchievement Test or the Iowa Test of BasicSkills. Any test used in the statewide testingsystem will have to be aligned with the state'sgraduation standards. The new law also asks districts to assess the performance of students at the secondarylevel according to the standards within theProfile of Learning, a state-developed sys-tem of measurements of overall student per-formance, and a part of the newly developedgraduation standards. The law calls for the assessment of second- ary students to begin during the 1999-2000school year, but it leaves the choice of testinginstruments and processes to the commis-sioner of the Department of Children, Fami-lies and Learning. The commissioner is required to report to the Legislature in 1998 on plans for assess-ment at the high school level. The law allows only narrow exceptions to the statewide testing requirements. For ex-ample, students who are new to this countryand are not proficient in English will beexempt. Another provision in the law requires that the 1997-1998 test results from each schooland each district be used to establish a baselineagainst which their future performance couldbe measured. Test results will be reported to the public in three forms: a raw number representingthe mean score for each school and district,a mean score of all students except those whoare new to a school or district, and a meanscore of all students except those receivinglimited English proficiency instruction. The results released to the public also will include the number of students on free andreduced-price lunch programs, the numberof special education students, and the num-ber of students with limited English profi-ciency at each site. Sen. Larry Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls) spon- sored the measure in the Senate. HF2179*/SF1934/CH138 New Laws Signed by the governorHelping dairy farmers Gov.

Earth Day, which falls on April 22, has been celebrated informally by environmen-tally concerned citizens since the spring of1970, when environmental leaders staged anationwide \"teach-in.\" The day is often marked with volunteer environmental cleanup efforts and publiceducation programs. Earth Day has now goneinternational with programs planned in sev-eral countries. Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth) spon- sored the resolution the Krentz (DFL-May Township) was theSenate sponsor. HF1692/SF1342*/Res. 4 Strawberry fields A resolution calling for better treatment of California straw-berry workers has been signed bythe governor. Strawberry workers, repre- sented by the United Farm Work- ers Union, are conducting a nationalcampaign to call attention to their plight.The typical strawberry worker earns about$8,500 per season for working as many as 12hours a day, stooped over the low berryplants. Despite record production levels and sales revenue of $650 million per year in the straw-berry industry, most workers have not had asignificant raise in 10 years. According to the resolution, workers also claim a variety of workplace abuses includ-ing: demand for sexual favors in exchangefor employment; hiring and firing on whim;lack of fresh water and clean toilet facilities;and lack of health care in an occupation thatexposes them to hazardous pesticides andchronic back injuries. Strawberry workers who have struggled tochange these practices and organize a union have faced firing and blacklisting. Workerswho have voted for union representationhave seen the fields they work plowed under. The resolution, which will be transmitted to President Bill Clinton and to the governorof California, puts the state on record alongwith a number of other states, consumergroups, environmental organizations,churches, labor organizations, and others insupport of the strawberry workers cause. Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Steve Novak (DFL-New Brighton) spon-sored the resolution. HF1877/SF1675*/Res. 3 Selling abandoned vehicles Minneapolis and St. Paul po- lice will be required to hold im-pounded vehicles for only 15 daysbefore putting them on the auc-tion block under a new state law. Signed May 6 by Gov. Arne Carlson, the law will address a problem thatleaves Minneapolis and St. Paul impoundlots overflowing with cars abandoned bytheir owners. Current state law requires a 45-day wait before an impounded vehicle can be sold.The new law will exempt Minneapolis andSt. Paul from that law and set a 15-day limitfor those cities. The law requires local approval by the city councils in Minneapolis and St. Paul beforeit takes effect. Supporters of the new measure said cur- rent law causes real problems in the cities,especially during winter months. A winterthat brings heavy snowfall leads to a lot ofparking violations and a lot of cars beingtowed from city streets to the impound lot. In St. Paul, where the city impound lot holds 750 vehicles, space in the lot can runout quickly, according to St. Paul PoliceDeputy Chief Ted Brown. Most people pay the fine and pick up their cars from the impound lot within a few days,but others would rather lose their vehiclesthan pay up, according to Brown. As a result,vehicles that \u2014 in effect \u2014 are abandonedmust be allowed to take up valuable lot spacefor 45 days before they can be sold off. Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored themeasure. HF342/SF166*/CH108Signed by the governorMinnesota dairy farmers have seen a sig- nificant drop in the prices they get for theirproducts, while the state's consumers con-tinue to pay exceptionally high retail pricesfor milk. Low prices paid to farmers are driving them out of the dairy business, according tosupporters of the resolution. The state is los-ing an average of three dairy operations a day. Currently, the Minnesota dairy industry generates $3.5 billion in annual gross rev-enue and employs about 39,000 people. The resolution calls for an end to a pricing system that is \"profoundly unfair and dis-criminatory against Minnesota and UpperMidwest dairy producers.\" It also requests that Minnesota and neigh- boring states be allowed to form a compactto guarantee dairy farmers a fair minimumprice if a similar compact already formed bynortheastern states is allowed to stand. The resolution was sponsored by Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) and Sen.Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples). HF1067*/SF1283/Res. 2Signed by the governor12 SESSION WEEKLY May 16, 1997 Inside the courtroom . . . Is the jury selection process fundamentally flawed? By Celeste Riley While the judicial process in the United States is patterned after that ofEngland, when it comes to selecting juries for criminal trials the two systems arean ocean apart. High-profile cases such as the O.J. Simpson and Oklahoma City bombing trials haveheightened awareness of the sometimes ex-haustive and time-consuming jury selectionprocess. At the local level, tales of beingdismissed for personal details \u2014 such ashaving friends who are police officers orhaving been the victim of a purse snatcher \u2014are common. The selection process can takehours, days, or weeks. In England, by contrast, once the first 12 jurors called from the jury pool are seated,the trial is likely to get under way \"with littlemore fanfare than a bow by the lawyers andcourt officials to the judge as he takes hisplace on the bench,\" according to E.C. Friesenand I.R. Scott in English Criminal Justice . Importantly, lawyers may not question thejurors. \"The jury box is filled with twelvejurors drawn from the voters lists . . . Thefirst juror is called, and before he is sworn,the counsel for the defence must object or beforever foreclosed,\" the authors write. \"Thefirst twelve called without objection consti-tute the jury. The contrast with the analo-gous procedure in American courts isstriking.\" Despite the differences, the court systems of both countries are known for high stan- dards of fairness and impartiality. Both are also known, however, for sometimes ren-dering highly controversial verdicts. In theU.S., the outcome of the Simpson trial standsout. England has raised eyebrows for wronglyconvicting and imprisoning Irish nationalsfor terrorism. Reps. Charlie Weaver (R-Anoka), Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), and Jim Farrell(DFL-St. Paul), each with extensive court-room experience, recently discussed the rela-tive merits of both systems. Their verdict? The American system of jury selection issuperior and should stay the way it is. \"The American system is much more con- cerned with protecting the rights of the de-fendant and does a better job of making surethe jury members are free of prejudice. Theemphasis in England is on speedy trials,\"said Entenza, who was trained in Englandand worked in the legal system there. \"Whensomeone's life and liberty are at stake, it's worth it to go the extra mile. The courts here have a high standard for convictions beyonda reasonable doubt.\" \"In England, you're guilty until proven innocent. The burden is on the defense,\"said Farrell, a former public defender whonow works as a prosecutor. But the public perception of a painstak- ing, time-consuming, yet arbitrary selectionprocess that weeds out qualified jurors isskewed due to the high-profile cases, Weaversaid. That scenario is more likely to happen in \"celebrity\" cases as a result of the intensescrutiny and the likelihood that jurors haveprior knowledge of the case. He said in mostcourtrooms, the jury selection process ismore expeditious. \"In 90 percent of my cases, jury selection is over within three hours. I don't thinkthat's unreasonable to ensure fairness,\"Weaver said. He said that once the prelimi-nary winnowing process is complete, mostof those remaining will wind up on the jury. Still, does the more careful American pro- cess result in better juries? \"In most cases,you probably could simply take the next 12[in the jury pool \u2014 like in England] and geta fair and impartial verdict,\" Weaver said.\"But neither side wants people who are pre-disposed one way or the other. In America,dismissal because of bias is the exception,not the norm. At least the American systemlets you weed out the neo-Nazis and otherobviously prejudiced people.\" Yet Weaver agreed that some attorneys can take the process too far. Either side mayoverstate the importance of little things, likethe last magazine a juror read or the mes-sages on the bumper stickers on their cars. \"Idon't think jurors should be eliminated be-cause of [pre-trial] publicity. The question iswhether or not they can be objective.\" \"If you take the American system to the \"The key is to let the system work \u2014 not to manipulate it. It's a dynamic system. It's an amazing thing for me to watch when justice occurs. It works when everyone tells the truth and you can tell the jury, 'Here it is. You decide.'\" \u2014Rep. Jim FarrellPicking a jury in American can take hours, days, or weeks. In England, by contrast, once the first 12jurors called from the jury pool are seated, the trial is likely to get under way \"with little more fanfarethan a bow by the lawyers. . .\"13 May 16, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYextreme you could wind up with a bunch of imbeciles on the jury,\" Entenza said. \"If youavoid people who know anything about thecase, you're eliminating everyone who readsthe newspapers.\" All agreed that it's up to judges to control excesses. After the prosecution and defensehave exercised their options to dismiss acertain number of jurors (five for the de-fense, three for the prosecution), the judgehas final say on those who remain. \"When[either side] starts asking jurors stupid ques-tions \u2014 like, 'What's your favorite TV show?'\u2014 the judge should say, 'Knock it off,'\"Farrell said. \"I've watched too many judgesexercise either too much control or too little.\" No movement is afoot at the Legislature to reform the jury selection process, nor, ac-cording to the representatives, should therebe. Any such effort would immediately raiseissues regarding the constitutional separa-tion of powers, Entenza pointed out. Yet, ifthe Legislature were to act, there are areas inwhich it could promote improvements.Weaver noted that the educational level ofjurors is diminished when either side insistson jurors who know nothing about the case.The Legislature could enact measures to as-sure the inclusion of a wide variety of jurors,for instance. \"The key is to let the system work \u2014 not to manipulate it,\" Farrell said. \"It's a dynamicsystem. It's an amazing thing for me to watchwhen justice occurs. It works when everyonetells the truth and you can tell the jury, 'Here it is. You decide.'\" Whether you prefer the expeditious English way of selecting jurors, or the ponder- ous American method, be glad you were not among those accused in parts of medievalEurope, where offenders were tried by ordeal , a forerunner of the jury system. According to Frederick G. Kempin, Jr., in his Historical Introduction to Anglo- American Law , there were four forms of ordeal: hot water (often called the \"caul- dron\"), cold water, hot iron, and morsel. \"In the ordeal of cold water, the accused crouched, placed his arms beneath his knees, was bound around his knees and body by a rope, and let down into a pool. Ifthe water received him and he sank he was innocent and was, it is to be hoped,immediately pulled out of the water. \"In the ordeal of the hot iron, the accused held a red-hot iron in his hand, its weight increasing with the severity of the crime, and carried it nine feet. The hand was thenbandaged. If after three days the wound was clean, the accused was innocent. \"In the ordeal of the hot water, the water was heated to a high heat and the accused was required to plunge his arm into the cauldron and retrieve a stone suspended bya cord. The more severe the crime the deeper the stone was placed, from wrist to elbowdepth. \"In the ordeal of the morsel the accused was required to try to swallow a morsel of bread or cheese, perhaps with a feather imbedded in it. If he could swallow, he wasinnocent, but if he gagged on it he was guilty. Evidence from early cases is said toindicate a preponderance of acquittals.\" Whether the defendant was subjected to burning, drowning, or choking depended on whether he was poor and unfree, a lay freeman, or clergy member. Unfortunately, things got worse for the accused before they got better. In 1275, according to Kempin, authorities managed to turn a seemingly good idea \u2014 jurytrials \u2014 into another burden for the defendant. If he refused to submit to a jury \u2014typically made up of his accusers \u2014 he would undergo \"a legal torture in which theaccused was laid on the ground and his chest was loaded with successively heavierweights until he either submitted to trial by jury or expired.\" \u2014 C.R.Would you prefer . . . Hot water, cold water, hot iron, or loaded morsel?

Mandatory insurance, increased education passes By Nick Healy After a winter during which 32 people died in snowmobile accidents and manyothers were injured, the House ap- proved a bill May 13 that would prescribe avariety of new measures to improve snow-mobile safety. The vote was 76-54. The bill ( HF551/SF94* ) would require snowmobilers to carry liability insurance,expand safety training requirements, andprovide new revenue for trail maintenanceand law enforcement. \"I think it is a good step in the right direction,\" said Jan Schlosser, whose 15-year-old daughter, Stacy, was killed by aspeeding snowmobiler in December 1996.\"People are going to think twice before theyget on a snowmobile and head off down thetrail.\" Stacy Schlosser, her twin sister, and some friends were walking on a road near EastBethel, Minn., when Stacy was struck by asnowmobiler traveling at a speed estimatedto be near 80 mph. Jan Schlosser said stepped up enforce- ment of snowmobile laws could help to pre-vent such tragedies, and that requiringsnowmobilers to carry liability insurancecould prevent other families from experi-encing unnecessary hardships in the after-math of snowmobile accidents. The man responsible for the death of Stacy Schlosser did not have insurance, and thefamily has had to absorb financial lossesfrom medical and funeral expenses. \"I don't understand the opposition to [the insurance requirement],\" Schlosser said. \"It'snot only to protect the people who are killedor injured by snowmobilers, it's to protectthe snowmobilers.\" Under the bill, snowmobile owners would be required to carry a minimum of $60,000in liability insurance, which proponents ofthe bill estimate would cost about $70 a year.Proof of insurance would be required toregister a snowmobile with the state. \"I think it is reasonable if you're going to be driving a snowmobile that you have li-ability insurance,\" said Rep. Kathleen Sekhon(DFL-Burns Township), who is sponsoringthe bill. \"If someone is injured, there's goingto be help for that person . . . I was surprisedto learn liability insurance isn't required ofsnowmobilers. That just seems like commonsense.\" Criticism of the bill focused on the newexpenses it would require of snowmobilers. In addition to insurance costs, the fee forstate registration would jump from $30 to$45 for three years and a new $10 annualpermit fee would be required to ride on statetrails and grant-in-aid trails maintained bylocal snowmobile clubs. \"An awful lot of people who don't have the resources are simply not going to registertheir snowmobiles,\" said Rep. Tom Bakk(DFL-Cook), who argued that the additionalcosts would be especially burdensome forpeople with moderate incomes who ownolder machines and use them only occasion-ally. \"It's a tragedy that this year 32 people lost their lives,\" Bakk said, \"[but] the provisionsin this bill related to insurance and lowerspeed limits are not going to save lives.\" The bill would reduce the nighttime speedlimit for snowmobiles from 50 mph to 40 mph. Sekhon said the change would im-prove safety by providing snowmobilersmore time to react and avoid accidents whenout after dark. Current law requires people under 18 to take a safety training course before they canoperate a snowmobile. The bill would ex-pand the training requirements to includesnowmobilers aged 29 and under. The increased registration fees and the new charge to ride on state trails wouldpump new revenue into improving trailsacross the state. Under the bill, 50 percent ofthe money in the state's snowmobile trailsand safety account would be earmarked forgrant-in-aid trails and 30 percent would goto state trails. (The remaining 20 percentwould be designated for law enforcementand safety education efforts.) \"We have a 1970s trail system for 1990s technology,\" said Rep. Leslie Schumacher(DFL-Princeton), a supporter of the bill.\"We need this influx of money.\" The death toll in snowmobile accidents during the past winter was the highest inMinnesota since 1972. While many this yearhave called for legislation aimed at improv-ing snowmobile safety, concerns have beenraised about the effects such legislation couldhave on what has grown into a multimillion-dollar industry in the state. During debate on the House floor, Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison), who hasworked on the snowmobile safety issue sinceearly in the legislative session, tried to allayconcerns that resorts and other businesseswould suffer as a result of the bill. \"We're not going to kill this sport,\" Peterson said. \"We're going to improve thesport.\" Schlosser, who has been a visible leader in efforts to pass new snowmobile safety mea-sures, said the bill would be something posi-tive to come out of the tragedies experiencedby her family and others. \"Stacy's gone, and it hurts every day,\" Schlosser said. \"I figure if I can help to pre-vent someone else from having to go throughthis \u2014 just one person \u2014 then it is worth theeffort.\" The bill now goes to the Senate . Jan Schlosser, of East Bethel, listened to the House floor debate on a bill that would impose a40 MPH night time speed limit for snowmobilersand make snowmobilers carry liability insurance.She held a picture of her daughter, Stacy, whowas killed Dec. 22, 1996 by a drunk snowmobiledriver.15 May 16, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYA bill for an act ating to civil actions; modifying and expanding rovisions for sanctions in civil actions; Statutes subdivision 6; and 609.5314, subdivision 3; proposing coding for new law in Minnesota Statutes, chapter 549; repealing Minnesota Statutes 1994, section 549.21.

Stadium bill rejected; enters realm of living dead By Steve Compton Like the goalie-masked psycho-killer in a grade-Bslasher movie, the Twins sta-dium proposal just refusesto die. No matter how manytimes it's killed, it gets backup and keeps moving. After stalling and bouncing back in a pair of committees, the bill ( HF1367 ) sponsored by Rep. Ann H. Rest (DFL-New Hope) wasdealt a seemingly fatal blow following three-and-one-half-hours of mayhem in a May 12House Taxes Committee meet-ing. House Speaker Phil Carru-thers was blud- geoned to death that same dayin the Senate Tax and Tax LawsCommittee. By the time the House Taxes Committee vote was taken onHF1367 , the much amended bill bore little resemblance to itsoriginal form. Rest herself in-troduced several amendmentsto change the deal with the own-ers and redefine funding sourcesfor the estimated $506 millionstadium proposal. One such amendment \u2014 ap- proved by the panel \u2014 limitedthe sports memorabilia tax toitems related to baseball. But Rest failed to convince the panel that a 5-cent-per-packcigarette tax would be a goodway to help pay for the ballpark.Rest, who cast the lone vote forthe amendment, said that tax-ing cigarettes is better than ex-panding gambling in the state. \"I don't seeany connection between smoking and thestadium,\" said Rep. Ted Winter (DFL-Fulda),speaking against the amendment. The mea-sure failed 21-1. Another funding proposal to place state- owned slot machines at Canterbury Parkracetrack was introduced and then with-drawn by Rep. Todd Van Dellen (R-Ply-mouth), only to be reintroduced by Rep. DeeLong (DFL-Mpls), chair of the committee.The gambling amendment contained no ref-erence to a baseball stadium, but earmarkedgambling revenue for flood relief and a new hockey arena to be built in St. Paul. Rep.Andy Dawkins (DFL-St. Paul) also wantedto add an increase the working family taxcredit. In the end, the gambling amendmentfailed on a 21-4 vote. Another Van Dellen amendment did pass. It deleted all of the stadium bill's languageand called for a state-sponsored plan to buyenough Twins tickets to make the team prof-itable this season. Van Dellen argued thatthis would void a provision in the Twinscontract with the Metrodome which allows the team to get out of their lease if they have three consecutive money-losing, low-atten-dance seasons. The Twins have threatenedto exercise that option and leave the state ifthe Legislature doesn't help build a new sta-dium. \"This [ticket buyout] takes the gun away from our head and gives us an equal negotiat-ing posture with the owner,\" Van Dellen said. The amendment passed 13-12, effectively becoming the main bill, but then was re-jected on the final 16-9 vote. But don't get up for more popcorn yet.Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul) has enlisted Rest to help him breathe new lifeinto a stadium proposal. The two lawmakersare discussing a bill authorizing Gov. ArneCarlson to negotiate a stadium deal on hisown for the state. Carlson would be requiredto reduce the cost of the $506 million projectenough to pay for it with user fees and,failing that, authorize a state-operated ca-sino. Rest has been opposed to gambling as a source of revenue, but her previous attemptsto pay for the stadium only with user fees have always come up short. Even if the Milbert-Rest sta- dium proposal fails in the finaldays of the session, there is still aglimmer of life remaining for anew ballpark. Winter, chair ofthe House Rules and LegislativeAdministration Committee, in-troduced a resolution ( HF2207 ) which passed that committeeMay 15, directing the LegislativeCommission on Planning andFiscal Policy to study and makerecommendations, \"on ways andmeans to secure and provide fora long-term commitment of pro-fessional major league sportsteams, specifically major leaguebaseball.\" The commission rec-ommendations would be due inthe Legislature by Sept. 1, 1997. Any stadium-related proposal has until May 19, the last day ofsession, to pass. The Twinsballpark issue could also be re-visited during a special session,which Carlson has said he maycall for in September when finaldamage estimates have been cal-culated concerning the record flooding in northwestern Minnesota. HF2207 next goes to the House floor. Efforts to find a way to pay for a new outdoor baseball stadium for the Minnesota Twins are still in limbo. Proposals to raise the money by hikingthe cigarette tax or installing state-owned slot machines at CanterburyPark racetrack have failed. One proposal calling for a state-sponsored buyout of Twins tickets this season to make the team profitable has also failed.

May 9 - 15, 1997 Once a bill has passed both the House and the Senate in identical form, it's ready to besent to the governor for consideration. Thegovernor has several options when consid-ering a bill. The governor can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which results in the bill becom- ing law in the first year of the biennium. The timing of these actions is as significantas the actions themselves. In the first year of the biennium, the im- portant thing to remember is that the gover-Bills await governor's action nor has three days from the time of \"present-ment\" to veto a bill. If the governor doesn'tsign the bill within this time frame, it willbecome law with or without his signature.(Sundays are not counted in the three-daytime limit, but holidays are.) Only on appropriations bills can the gov- ernor exercise the line-item veto authority.This option allows the governor to eliminatethe appropriation items to which he objects.As with all vetoes, the governor must includea statement listing the reasons for the vetowith the returned bill. Here, too, the time-table is within three days after the governorreceives the bill. A two-thirds vote of the members in eachhouse is needed to override a veto.

Observant visitors to the Capitol may notice, suspended high above theirheads in the middle of the dome, anornate crystal chandelier. Usually, said Carolyn Kompelien, of the Capitol Historic Site Program, thechandelier remains unlit. But there arethose occasions, she continued, whenthe massive fixture illuminates the ro-tunda. The chandelier, Kompelien ex- plained, is always lit on the anniversaryof Minnesota's admittance to theUnion: May 11. This year, that date fellon a Sunday, so the maintenance per-sonnel brightened the rotunda on Fri-day as well, so citizens could enjoy thewarm glow. Inaugurations, too, are occasions worthy of the light, although lately, shesaid, the trend has been toward holdingthe events outside the Capitol. \"It's just sort of been forgotten,\" Kompelien said of the inaugural tradi-tion. The lamp is also lit during times of sadness. Whenever the body of a Min-nesota dignitary lies in state, the chan-delier provides the light. Legendarystatesman Hubert H. Humphrey was Capitol chandelier: illuminating Minnesota politics whenever he feels like it. Indeed, oneCapitol docent recalls hearing somenoise coming from the rotunda afterhours one evening. Curious, the guidewent forth to explore and there, danc-ing a polka under the blazing chande-lier, was Gov. Rudy Perpich and hiswife, Lola, along with several friends. Kompelien said there are no official regulations regarding the lighting ofthe usually dormant chandelier. The fixture itself dates from 1904, when it was purchased from a NewYork City manufacturer at a cost of$1,250. In 1991 dollars, the chandelierwould cost nearly $20,000. The original specifications called for \"the very best quality French cut crys-tals\" and required that the fixture hang\"about 28 feet from the top of thedome.\" The light has a diameter of six feet and a circumference of nearly 20 feet. Itfeatures 92 75-watt lamps mounted ona ribbed, metal framework and can, bymeans of an electric motor, be raisedand lowered as needed. The chandelierand the chain together weigh nearly2,500 pounds. \u2014F.J.G.Though the glowing crystal orb may look small from the ground, this 6-foot highchandelier is suspended by a massivechain 120 feet above the State Capitol'srotunda floor.

Printed on paper which 50% recycled,20% post-consumer content. Printedonre cycledpaperThe empty chambers, hallways, and hearing rooms of the Capitol and State Office Building are a sharp contrast to the frenzied activity that is the norm between Januaryand May. Lawmakers have gone home to wait for the special session while legislativeleaders are conferring with the governor to reach a compromise on equitable languagefor three bills they have yet to agree on. The smell of cooking bratwursts from the Ulcer Gulch snack bar has subsided, and the hordes of lobbyists who mill about to engage legislators in talk on some last-minuteissue are all back in their respective home offices. Yet, the dedicated experts \u2014 thehistorical society tour guides \u2014 continue to inform the general public about theglorious history of the state, the magnificent architecture and artwork of the Capitol,and the rooms where issues get debated, made into law, or defeated. One aspect not noticed very often is the Capitol building's unique \"personality.\" When the lawmakers are in session, the building may easily embrace a thousandpeople on a daily basis, but its statues and pillars and gilded ceilings seem to becomemere observers of the process for which the building is intended. On a day when toursare sporadic and the halls are empty, except for an occasional staffer deliveringpaperwork, not only are the different types of marble columns more obvious to thecasual observer, the portraits of past governors even seem to take on a more prominentstance. Another \"feeling\" of the building is one experienced on a quiet Saturday or Sunday afternoon. This disposition is likened to a quiet walk through a classic art museum.The great impressions of Minnesota's political and historical past are depicted in softcolors, gold inlaid inscriptions, brass, wood, and stone. Very obvious and some oftensubtle works of art take the concept of a museum a step further. Not only are objectson walls, the walls and ceilings themselves are works of unique art. The most impressive \"feel\" of the building has not been experienced by most visitors. Its a rare occasion for those few who have found themselves alone in thebuilding after 10 p.m. and the lights have been subdued. No eeriness prevails. Whatis experienced is a sense of warmth, peace, and a very comfortable feeling \u2014 even if itis not true that \"All is right with the world.\" The State Capitol building can be a great teacher if its transient \"personalities\" are observed and heeded. -LeClair G. LambertMay 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 3Week in Review . . . May 15 - 19, 1997 Highlights By F.J. Gallagher When the members of the 80th Legisla- ture convened Jan. 7, they knew that theywould have to make decisions affecting Min-nesota citizens on the most fundamentallevels. During the course of the session, legisla- tors \u2014 working with a projected budgetsurplus of nearly $2.3 billion \u2014 wrestledwith policy decisions of historic magnitude,redefining welfare and changing the wayMinnesota educates and evaluates its stu-dents. Yet, as the House adjourned just before midnight on May 19, the specter of a specialsession emerged as more than just a possibil-ity. Indeed, when legislators found them-selves hamstrung over a disagreement withGov. Arne Carslon on $150 million worth ofeducation tax credits, it became an absolutecertainty. The House proposed a number of changes to Minnesota education, lengthening theschool year, putting new dollars into schoolcomputers, and increasing per-pupil fund-ing by slightly more than 2 percent. Yetmembers refused to include a provision thatwould provide low- and moderate-incomeparents with a tax credit to help defray thecost of tutoring, summer school or tuition ata private school. As a result, Carlson has threatened to veto Regular session closes . . . Stalemate on tax credits forces special session a number of the major spending bills sent tohim by the Legislature, including a tax billthat would rebate more than $500 million ofthe state's budget surplus back to the taxpay-ers. What's more, the governor has vowed to call members back for a special session \u2014perhaps as early as June \u2014 so they can in-clude his education tax credit proposal.(House and Senate leaders will re-enter ne-gotiations with the governor's office on May27.) The governor has signed many of the bills sent to him by the Legislature, though \u2014welfare reform, for example. Beginning July 1, most families receiving cash assistance from the state will face a 60-month, lifetime limit on benefits. As of Jan.1, 1998, local governments will use a packageof sanctions, wage incentives, and child-careaid to help poor parents move into the workforce. The governor also agreed to remove caps on K-12 education spending that would haveforced the state's school districts to imposedrastic cutbacks on their programs. The Legislature also has sent the governor a number of other major bills, many of whichstill await his signature as of this writing. At the start of the session, nearly every lawmaker cited the need to reform the state'scomplex property tax system, a convolutedcode responsible for some of the highest tax rates in the country. Although many of the serious reform pro- visions relating to tax increment financingand local government aid fell by the wayside,a bill finally emerged that featured \u2014 inaddition to the rebates \u2014 long-term ratecuts for businesses and market-rate apart-ments. Legislators also pumped more dollars into the criminal justice system, which is one ofthe fastest-growing areas of state spending.In addition to the extra funding, the Legisla-ture also sent the governor a bill that wouldallow many of the state's prisons to beginhousing prisoners two to a cell. The state's innovative MinnesotaCare pro- gram, which provides health coverage tolow-income citizens, is also in for somechanges that would make more residentseligible, while saving doctors and health pro-viders money. The program is funded by a 2 percent tax on the revenue generated by health care pro-viders. Over the next two years, that tax willdrop to 1.5 percent, saving medical serviceproviders nearly $40 million. A separate plan passed by the Legislature would put the state into the prescriptiondrug business. The state would purchasedrugs in bulk and pass the savings \u2014 esti-mated at around 10 percent of current retail Gov. Arne Carlson, left, and House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum urged conferees negotiating the omnibus K-12 finance bill May 16 to includeCarlson's plan for education tax credits, which would help subsidize privateschool tuition.House Speaker Phil Carruthers and Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, behind , encouraged Gov. Arne Carlson at a May 22 press conference to sign the omnibus K-12 Finance finance bill and avert a Special Session.4 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYAGRICULTURE Cheap milk Grocers would be allowed to set milk prices as low as they please during one month of theyear under a bill approved May 19 by theHouse. The vote was 121 to 13. Current state law prohibits retailers from selling milk for less than what they paid forit. The law is supposed to protect farmersand small grocers from being negatively af-fected by pricing wars. But Minnesota dairy farmers and con- sumers have not fared well in recent months. The state's farmers now get some of the lowest prices in the nation for their prod-ucts, and Minnesota consumers continue topay some of the highest milk prices in thecountry. Rep. Steve Trimble (DFL-St. Paul) origi- nally sought to lift the law prohibiting be-low-cost milk prices for a period of one year. Trimble argued that the change would allowfor more competition in the market andcould drive up demand for dairy products. However, the proposed one-year suspen- sion of the pricing law did not survive inconference committee. The final version of the bill ( HF1646/ SF1834* ) would suspend the dairy pricing law during the months of June, July, andAugust this year and in June every year there-after. The annual, month-long period of un- constrained pricing would be declared \"DairyMonth.\" The bill also calls for the Depart-ment of Agriculture to report to the Legisla-ture in 1998 on the many factors that areinvolved in dairy pricing and the potentialeffects of deregulation. Rep. Tony Kielkucki (R-Lester Prairie) argued that the bill would benefit only thelarge, chain-store retailers who could affordto knock milk prices down extremely lowjust to attract customers. \"It's going to have a very negative impact on the small grocers who have to try tocompete with the big grocery stores,\"Kielkucki said. But those small grocers are working at a disadvantage under the current law, Trimblesaid. Large grocers can afford to sell milk atcost because they have other revenue sources,such as slotting fees paid for prominent place-ment, that small grocers can't match, headded. Trimble said small grocers and consumers may be better served by simply allowing themarket to function freely. The bill now goes to the governor.Helping dairy farmers Gov. Arne Carlson signed a resolution April 21 asking thefederal government to providerelief for Minnesota dairy farm-ers who are currently feeling afinancial squeeze. The resolution \u2014 to be sent to Congress, the president, and the Department of Agri-culture \u2014 asks for changes in the federalmilk pricing system. Minnesota dairy farmers have seen a sig- nificant drop in the prices they get for theirproducts, while the state's consumers con-tinue to pay exceptionally high retail pricesfor milk. Low prices paid to farmers are driving them out of the dairy business, according tosupporters of the resolution. The state islosing an average of three dairy operations aday. Currently, the Minnesota dairy industry generates $3.5 billion in annual gross rev-enue and employs about 39,000 people. The resolution calls for an end to a pricing system that is \"profoundly unfair and dis-criminatory against Minnesota and UpperMidwest dairy producers.\" It also requests that Minnesota and neigh- boring states be allowed to form a compactto guarantee dairy farmers a fair minimumprice if a similar compact already formed bynortheastern states is allowed to stand. The resolution was sponsored by Rep. Steve Wenzel (DFL-Little Falls) and Sen.Dallas Sams (DFL-Staples). HF1067*/SF1283/Res. 2Signed by the governor BONDING New revenue building A bill that would provide $73 million in new bonding funds for construction of abuilding to house the Department of Rev-enue was approved May 19 by the House.The vote was 110-20. The bill ( HF632 ), (DFL-Bovey), a totalof $111 million in bonding revenue andother expenditures for projects includingthe revenue building, flood damage reduc-tion, cleanup of contaminated lands, andrenovation of the Capitol cafeteria. This year, the search for a home for the revenue department has been the focus ofsignificant concern. The department cur-rently occupies a building located at 10 RiverPark Plaza, opposite downtown St. Paul on Grocers would be allowed to set milk prices as low as they please during one month of the year undera bill on its way to the governor.prices \u2014 on to consumers. Never far from the front pages or lawmak- ers' telephones was the issue of the Minne-sota Twins and owner Carl Pohlad's effort topersuade legislators to help fund a new base-ball stadium. A broad range of options were considered, from an increased cigarette tax to an expan-sion of gambling to an outright purchase ofthe team. One by one, all ideas were shotdown.May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 5BUSINESSthe Mississippi River, but the building is not owned by the state. The department has been at its current location since 1988, when it relocated fromthe Centennial Office Building in the Capi-tol complex. At that time, the state negoti-ated a five-year lease \u2014 with five one-yearrenewal options \u2014 with St. Paul's JLT Group,which constructed the building to meet de-partment specifications. Last year, the department exercised its last renewal option and paid JLT $6.3 million inrent. According to a report by consultantshired by the Legislature, the department hasoutgrown the current building, and the de-partment will need even more space by 2010,when it will employ nearly 1,500 workers. The consultant recommended that the agency be moved to a building that would beconstructed on a site in Inver Grove Heights.However, the bonding bill does not pre-scribe precisely where a new facility wouldbe constructed, nor does the bill mandatethat a new building be constructed at all. A total of $74.9 million would be available for the revenue department project, underthe bill. That amount includes $1.9 millionfor design costs approved as part of 1996bonding legislation, and $73 million in newbond funds included in the current bill. Under the bill, the Minnesota Depart- ment of Administration could opt to pur-chase the current building, but the amountavailable to purchase it would be capped at$23 million. (Earlier this session, an officialrepresenting JLT said the state could pur-chase the building for $38.9 million.) The bill would allow construction of a new facility in Inver Grove Heights only ifthe Department of Administration is notable to purchase the current site for $23million or less and determines that it is notfeasible to construct a new building withinthe Capitol complex. The amount availablefor an Inver Grove Heights facility would becapped at $46 million. (The consultant recommended construc- tion of a building at the intersection of Inter-state 494 and Highway 52 in Inver GroveHeights, and told lawmakers the projectwould carry a price tag of $49.5 million.) The bill would require only that the rev- enue department building be located withineight miles of the State Capitol, but the mea-sure includes provisions designed to easeany effort to locate a new building within theimmediate Capitol area. Under the bill, the building would not have to conform with the comprehensiveplan for the Capitol area, and the projectwould not have to be selected through adesign competition as is typically required within the Capitol complex. The bill now goes to the governor. Here are some highlights of other provisions inthe measure. A total of $7 million would be made avail- able for cleanup of contaminated indus-trial sites \u2014 so-called brownfields. Manysuch sites are found in urban areas.

Efforts to reduce the damage caused by floods in Minnesota would receive an in-fusion of $4 million. The funds would go tothe Department of Natural Resources foran existing grant program that providesfunds to local government for planningand implementing flood mitigation mea-sures.

A 1996 law provided $1.2 million for renovation of the cafeteria, but thatamount proved to be well short of theestimated price tag for the project. Thecurrent proposal would increase the totalbond revenue for the cafeteria project to atotal of $2.24 million. A total of $3 million would be provided to local governments to rehabilitate deficientbridges. The funds could be used to repairor replace bridges, cover the local match-ing funds requirements for federal bridgerehabilitation grants, or to pay costs asso-ciated with abandonment of bridges.6 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYfrom vending machines, except for those in locations \u2014 such as a bar \u2014 where peopleunder 18 are not allowed. It also bans theopen display of single packages of cigarettesor smokeless tobacco in stores, except forthose that derive at least 90 percent of theirrevenue from tobacco sales. Under HF117 , cigarette manufacturers would be required to disclose whether theirproduct contains ammonia, arsenic, cad-mium, formaldehyde, or lead. The bill also spells out a number of admin- istrative penalties that would be imposed onlicensees and store clerks convicted of sellingtobacco products to a teenager, in additionto similar provisions that would apply to theminor who attempted the purchase. Any license holder convicted of a first offense would draw a $75 fine. A secondoffense within a two-year period would costthe retailer $200 and the third offense withinthe same period would warrant a $250 pen-alty, plus a seven-day suspension of the to-bacco license. The clerk who sold the tobacco would receive a $50 civil fine. (Clerks already faceup to a year in jail and a $3,000 criminalpenalty for selling tobacco to a minor.) Any juvenile found to have illegally pur- chased tobacco \u2014 a petty misdemeanor un-der the law \u2014 could receive a fine of up to$100, a community service sentence, proba-tion, or be required to participate in sub-stance abuse programs. If the minor used adriver's license to commit the act, the licensewould be suspended for 90 days. The proposal explicitly states that local governments may pass ordinances that aremore strict than HF117 . The bill would re- quire that tobacco retailers to be affected bysuch a proposal must be notified 30 daysprior to any meeting on the possible changes. Last session, a bill to limit youth access to tobacco was derailed by the same issue. Aftera provision that would have prohibited localunits of government from enacting tobaccosales ordinances tougher than those con-tained in the bill, it was pulled by its authorand never resurfaced. So-called \"pre-emp-tion\" laws of varying strengths already are onthe books in more than two dozen states. CHILDREN Signed by the governorSigned by the governor Liquor laws New regulations affecting the distribution and sale of alcoholicbeverages went into effect retro-active to Oct. 1, 1996, under leg-islation signed by Gov. ArneCarlson. Under the law, no one may deliver alco-holic beverages anywhere in Minnesota ex- cept to a licensed wholesaler's warehouse, ifthe drink was manufactured outside the state.Exceptions exist for liquor just passingthrough during the course of interstate com-merce or for legally sanctioned personal con-sumption. Minnesota law allows an individual to import up to one liter of hard liquor or 2.25gallons of beer or wine from another statewithout paying an excise tax. People enter-ing the state from a foreign country canimport up to four liters of hard liquor or 2.5gallons of beer or wine for home use. Minnesota wineries, and those in states that have a reciprocal agreement with Min-nesota, may ship up to two cases of productper year to individuals. The law also prohibits merchants from soliciting sales, other than those to licensedwholesalers, through the mail and from ac-cepting sales orders over the Internet. The Department of Public Safety's Division of Liquor Control and Division of Alcohol andGambling are consolidated by the law. Depart-ment representatives had testified before theHouse Commerce, Tourism and ConsumerAffairs Committee that they had already mergedthe two divisions and that the law would merelymake the change official. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL-Kennedy) and Sen. Sam So-lon (DFL-Duluth). HF524/SF277*/CH129 Unauthorized switches The practice is known as slam- ming and loading. A long-dis-tance telephone company sendsa customer a check, a sweepstakesform, or a survey. What the cus-tomer often doesn't realize is thatby participating or signing, they've authorized the company to remove(\"slam\") the customer's long-distance ser-vice and replace (\"load\") it with a new one. A new law signed by the governor estab- lishes the practice as consumer fraud andauthorizes the attorney general's office totake action at a customer's request. The law, effective April 30, 1997, says it is fraudulent to change a customer's servicewithout the customer's verified consent, andthat it is the responsibility of the telephonecompany to prove consent. \"If there's any question\" on the customer's part about the switch being legally autho-rized, \"the company has to have an authori-zation in writing,\" said Rep. Mike Delmont(DFL-Lexington), the House bill's sponsor.Stop luring businesses Gov. Arne Carlson signed a resolution April 26 asking thefederal government to put a stopto practices that allow states tolure businesses, including pro-fessional sports franchises, away from other states. The resolution states that business incen- tive programs have resulted in counterpro-ductive economic competition betweenstates that saps the nation's readiness to com-pete in a global economy. Ranking high among the list of concerns included in the resolution is the practice ofusing public resources to lure professionalsports teams away from other states. MajorLeague Baseball's exemption from federalanti-trust laws is another. \"States, in the aggregate, would be better off providing a less burdensome tax climatefor all businesses and a quality educationsystem\" rather than frittering away moneyto attract individual companies, the resolu-tion states. The resolution calls for Congress to repeal the anti-trust exemption for professionalbaseball and to take other steps to mitigateeconomic competition between states. The resolution will be sent to members of Minnesota's congressional delegation andother officials in Congress. Also, it will go togovernors and legislative leaders in each state. Rep. Jim Knoblach (R-St. Cloud) and Sen. Arlene Lesewski (R-Marshall) sponsored theresolution.

Autism is a disorder that affects children and consists of a preoc-cupation with inner thoughts. Signed by the governorA 1996 law required that a long-distance company reinstall a customer's original ser-vice at no charge and then re-bill the cus-tomer at a lower rate if the original chargeswould have been lower. The new bill addsthat the company could be required to ab-sorb the long-distance costs accrued whilethe unauthorized service was in effect. Sen.

(Art. 9,Sec. 10) Many of the bill's original provisions, in- cluding the establishment of a statewide gang-fighting strike force and arson strike force,and revisions to the juvenile justice system,remain in the bill. Under the bill, work loads for probation officers would be reduced; women leavingprostitution would find help; and moneywould travel to community advocacy groupsto help battered women. The Department of Corrections (DOC) would be expected to reduce the daily (perdiem) cost of housing prisoners, makinglayoffs possible. Low-income families would have easier access to legal representation in court, aswould low-income farmers. Courts wouldbe given money to launch a pilot program toimprove the resolution of family matters.The program would assign one judge to heardomestic abuse, probate, juvenile and delin-quency matters for a single family. County attorneys, public defenders, vic- tim advocates, and shelter personnel wouldbe trained in how to help victims of crimesthat involve possible exposure to HIV. The DOC would construct a new building for the wilderness endeavors program forjuvenile offenders at Thistledew Camp innorthern Minnesota. Below are some otherhighlights of HF163/SF1880* in more detail. Gang strike force A major initiative in this year's crime- prevention bill is to establish a gang taskforce and oversight council. The strike forcewould look at gang problems throughoutthe state, and be overseen by the council,which would be made up of top law enforce-ment officials from across the state. In addi- tion to setting up the strike force, the councilwould develop a plan to investigate and pros-ecute crimes committed by gangs. The strikeforce would assist and train local govern-ments and law enforcement agencies to iden-tify gang members. (Art. 8, Sec. 8 ) A second tool to fight gangs would be a gang intervention pilot grant program, inwhich the DOC, through local agencies,would provide services to gang memberswho want to leave their gang. To qualify forhelp, a gang member must be under 25 yearsold and not currently serving time. Theymust not have received similar servicesthrough other programs, and must complywith the program requirements and be em-ployable. (Art. 2, Sec. 3) The DOC would report back to the Legis- lature on the program's success by January1999. Arson strike force The bill would set up an arson-fighting strike force that would provide expert inves-tigative and prosecutorial assistance to localagencies in complex and serious cases ofarson. The strike force would consist of rep-resentatives from the fire marshal's depart-ment, the BCA, the attorney general's office,police and fire department officials, thecounty attorney's association, private detec-tives, and other experts. The law responds toan epidemic of arson fires throughout thestate, especially fires related to gang vio-lence. (Art. 8, Sec. 20) In addition to battling fires, the strike force would help train public safety person-nel and set up educational programs forthem and for prosecutors. Related provisions in the bill would estab-8 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYlish a statewide juvenile fire-starter inter- vention network, and make clear that refus-ing to testify or produce evidence in an arsoncase can be punished through district courts.Further, a person who commits arson in aneffort to conceal another crime could notonly be convicted of both crimes but sen-tenced for both. (Art. 8, Sec. 21) Juvenile crime Closely associated with efforts to combat gang problems are initiatives to address prob-lems among juveniles, the focus of manycommittee hearings. The bill includes at leastfive measures to prevent juvenile crime. Community service grant pilot project. Children under age 16 in high-crime neighborhoods in Ramsey and Hennepincounties would be recruited to perform vol-untary community service. The projectwould provide funding to community-basedorganizations to administer the project. Thegoal is to encourage good citizenship anddiscourage illegal activity among partici-pants. The programs could offer childrenscholarships, gift certificates, tickets for en-tertainment or group outings, or other non-monetary rewards. The bill stipulates that participating com- munity agencies must be closely connectedwith the community and local governmen-tal units, represent a diverse population, havea demonstrated ability to successfully coor-dinate the program and to interact with ju-veniles, and have a successful history workingwith schools and parents of juveniles. (Art.2, Sec. 8) Enhanced probation pilot project; Ramsey County This program would provide intensive monitoring and coordination between juve-nile probation officers, local law enforce-ment personnel, and culturally specificcommunity nonprofit agencies. The focus ofthe effort would be juveniles on probationwho are considered at risk for committingviolent crimes and are associated with gangand drug activities in Ramsey County. The goal is to discourage young people from criminal activity by providing inten-sive intervention by the involved commu-nity and law enforcement groups. The countymust provide a status report to the Legisla-ture by March each year. (Art. 2, Sec. 4) Pilot for school-based probation in Anoka and Dakota counties Established by the DOC, the program would select one middle or junior high schooland one senior high school in each countyfor an experiment in placing probation of- ficers within schools to help address behav-ioral incidents by students on probation.The officers would work with school person-nel, families, and other agencies to coordi-nate responses to behavioral problems. Areport on the project's effectiveness wouldbe due to the Legislature by January 1999.(Art. 2, Sec. 5) Pilot for juvenile gun offenders in Hennepin County Juveniles in Hennepin County who are caught illegally possessing a pistol would becommitted to a local county correctionalfacility for not less than 30 days. Twenty-three of those days could be stayed (post-poned), however, if the juvenile successfullycompletes a 40-hour course on gun educa-tion after seven days. The county wouldreport on the project's effectiveness by Janu-ary 1999. (Art. 2, Sec. 7) General crime provisions The bill would make more than 30 changes to crime-fighting laws. Certain misdemeanorcrimes, including prostitution, tamperingwith a motor vehicle, damage to property,and some weapons and controlled-substancecrimes, would become gross misdemeanorsand subject to increased penalties if the de-fendant has a history of committing thosecrimes. The measure is an effort to clean upneighborhoods plagued by petty crime anddrug dealers. In that same interest, witnessesto the crimes would be kept apprised of thefinal outcomes of the cases.Elderly and handicapped people would get more protection against con artists. Thebill would make it a gross misdemeanor tocommit certain types of fraud that wouldcause the victim to lose assets or income.(Art. 3, Sec. 12) Criminals should stop when asked to by police. The bill would increase from a grossmisdemeanor to a three-year felony the crimeof fleeing a police officer while in a motorvehicle. (Art. 3, Sec. 13) This year a loophole was discovered in the law regarding harboring a fugitive: It didn'tcover the abettor if the fugitive happened tobe on probation. The bill makes it clear thatyou can't harbor fugitives from the law \u2014whether on probation or not. (Art. 3, Sec.13) Sex offenders The bill would require the DOC and gov- ernmental agencies to develop a plan to re-quire sex offenders leaving federal prisons toregister under the Community NotificationAct. The current law covers offenders leav-ing correctional facilities and half-way housesother than those in the federal system. Also,the bill would make it mandatory for locallaw enforcement agencies to disclose theinformation to the public. The current lawonly authorizes them to do so.

The crime occurred at a time when their parents were divorcing.Many people feel the system failed to re-spond to warning signs that could havehelped prevent the tragedy. The bill would tighten the rules regarding visitation when a restraining order has beenfiled against a parent. A petition for marriage dissolution would have to state whether a restraining order is ineffect. If so, a judge would have to considerthe restraining order before making a deci-sion regarding visitation. In deciding cus-tody issues, the judge would have to considerany finding of domestic abuse. The act also would award grants to create or maintain a family visitation center tosafely facilitate visitation decisions. (Art. 7,Secs. 8, 40) Victims of juveniles The bill would create an exception to the rule that all information regarding juvenilecourt matters are closed to the public. Peoplewho are victimized by youthful offenderswould be allowed to learn the offender'sname upon request. The names would notbe released if doing so would interfere withthe trial or if the victim's motives are suspect.(Art. 7, Sec. 4) Confidentiality Prosecutors, with court approval, could opt to withhold information pertaining to avictim's address or place of employment forthe sake of the victim's safety. (Art. 7, Sec. 20) Keeping victims posted In addition to other measures that would inform victims of the status of certain cases,the bill would require prosecuting authori- ties to keep victims apprised of investigativedata collected by law enforcers, within cer-tain guidelines. (Art. 7, Sec. 5) Victims alsowould be notified if an offender's sentencefor a felony might be modified or appealed.(Art. 7, Sec. 22) Restorative justice Local units of government could provide forums where an offender could meet withthe victim, the victim's family, and othersrelated to the case to discuss the impact ofthe offense on the victim and community,assign an appropriate sanction, and providemethods for reintegrating the offender intothe community if he or she is from the com-munity. (Art. 2, Sec. 11) Inmate employment, access to computers Earlier this year, the public learned that an inmate with a history of sex offenses waskeeping a list of names of Minnesota chil-dren. The list was compiled through accessto the Internet. Prisoners use computers forwork and educational purposes. The bill would forbid inmates from par- ticipating in such work activities unless ad-equate security is provided by the facility.Access to the Internet would be prohibitedexcept for work, educational, and vocationalpurposes. Regular monitoring of inmatecomputer use would be required. A related provision would restrict access to the Internet by those on probation andparolees. (Art. 9, Sec. 18) Nuisances Finally, in a measure intended to help neighborhoods, the bill strengthens tenantand nuisance laws. Prostitution and firearmsviolations would be added to prohibited be-Harassing, stalking, sentencing A new law to strengthen the state's anti-stalking law andtoughen penalties for those vio-lating orders for protection andrestraining orders was signed bythe governor. The law defines harassing or stalking be- havior as intentional conduct that the of-fender knows or has reason to know wouldcause the victim to feel frightened, threat-ened, oppressed, persecuted, or intimidated.Importantly, the bill states that prosecutorswill not be required to prove that the of-fender intended to cause those reactions inthe victim, only that the offender knew orshould have known that the conduct wouldcause the reactions and that the victim did,in fact, experience them. In the event a dan-gerous weapon is used during a harassmentor stalking violation, the offense will be pun-ished by a mandatory minimum sentence. Ifthe weapon is a firearm, a three-year penaltyapplies for the first offense, and a five-yearpenalty applies to subsequent offenses; if thedangerous weapon is not a firearm, a one-year penalty applies to the first offense, anda three-year penalty applies to subsequentoffenses. The changes were necessary given a recent Minnesota Supreme Court ruling that weak-ened the current stalking law. The law also creates felony penalties for violating an order for protection or a harass-ment restraining order under certain cir-cumstances. Such cases will include violationsoccurring within five years after sentencingfrom two or more previous protection orrestraining order violation, or if the offenderpossessed a dangerous weapon during theoffense. Other violations of restraining orders will draw the felony penalty if the act is moti-vated by race, religion, sex, sexual orienta-tion, disability, age or national origin; if theoffender intends to interfere with a judicialproceeding or retaliate against an officialinvolved in a case; if the victim is a minor and A new law to strengthen the state's anti-stalking law has been signed by the governor. Changes werenecessary given a recent Minnesota Supreme Court ruling that weakened the original stalking law.Signed by the governorhaviors in landlord-tenant agreements. Aperson filing a complaint against a tenant fornuisance or other illegal behavior could re-quest an expedited hearing. If granted, thehearing would be held five to seven days aftera summons is issued. Further, a nuisanceabatement action would not be brought if aproperty owner improves the problem oragrees to a plan to abate the problem within30 days of receiving notice. (Art. 12, Sec. 4)10 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYthe offender is at least three years older; or if the offender falsely impersonates another. Under the law, offenders could be sen- tenced to a maximum of five years in prisonand a $10,000 fine. A minimum of 30 days injail (and counseling) will be mandated for afelony protection order violation in caseswhere the court stays the sentence as a con-dition of probation. Finally, the law clarifies that an offender may not waive the right to be sentencedunder the state's sentencing guidelines. Theprovision is a result of the Minnesota Su-preme Court's ruling in State v. Givens , and is intended to promote consistency and pre-dictability in judicial sentencing. In the Givens case, the defendant agreed to accept probation instead of incarcerationfor a purse-snatching offense. However,under the conditions of the agreement, if heviolated probation, he would serve doublethe jail time recommended under the guide-lines. The offender later did violate proba-tion, but appealed the sentence. The law makes it clear that while the guide- lines are advisory to the courts, they are notrights that a defendant can waive. The law also states that if a defendant agrees to be sentenced outside the guide-lines, he or she may not appeal the sentenceafter 90 days or after committing anothercrime, whichever is first. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Falcon Heights) and Sen.Ember Reighcott Junge (DFL-New Hope). HF5*/SF32/CH96 DEVELOPMENT Double-bunking inmates Most inmates would share cells at an $89 million prison to be constructed in RushCity, Minn., under a bill approved May 19 bythe House. The vote was 130-0. The bill ( HF268 ), sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown), would alter astate law requiring that inmates be placed inseparate cells whenever possible in close-custody prisons \u2014 such as the one plannedfor Rush City \u2014 and maximum-securityfacilities. A 1996 bonding measure provided $89 million for construction of a prison that wasoriginally expected to house at least 800 pris-oners in six residential units. The 1996 law also included a provision requiring the Department of Administra-tion to investigate the feasibility of double-bunking prisoners in one of the residentialunits. This session, lawmakers were told that thefunding approved last year would fall short of the amount needed to construct the prisonaccording to the original plans. The Department of Corrections offered revised plans calling for the construction ofonly four residential units with 136 cells ineach. Three of the four units would be madeup of double-occupancy cells, which wouldpush the facility's capacity to 952 inmates. Under the bill, double-bunking would be allowed only in corrections facilities at cer-tain security levels identified within a newclassification system. The Department of Corrections would institute a six-level security system, with onebeing the minimum level of security and sixbeing the maximum. Double-bunking would be allowed only at facilities at level four or under, and RushCity would be a level four. Stillwater and St.Cloud would be level five, and Oak ParkHeights (the state's only maximum-securityprison) would be level six. Contrary to current law, which calls for inmates to be in single cells whenever pos-sible, the bill would require facilities at secu-rity levels of four or under to permit multipleoccupancy \"to the greatest extent possible.\" The double-occupancy cells at Rush City are expected to measure 84.2 square feet.Cells at St. Cloud are only 48 square feet, andthose at Stillwater are 60 square feet. The bill now goes to the governor. Economic development, housing A $412.9 million bill that sets aside money for job creation, tourism, trade, and a varietyof housing assistance programs is on its wayto the governor's desk. A compromise version of the omnibus economic development and housing financebill passed both the House and Senate May16. The measure (DFL-Bricelyn), mergesomnibus bills from the Economic Develop-ment Finance Division and the Housing andHousing Finance Division. For economic development, the bill sets aside money for a diverse group of stateagencies, from the Department of Trade andEconomic Development to the Departmentof Economic Security. For housing, the bill appropriates money to aid the homeless, disabled, and first-timehome buyers through programs adminis- tered by the Minnesota Housing FinanceAgency. Among the economic development bill's provisions is a $6.5 million appropriation tohelp Minnesota's welfare families train forjobs. Federal law now requires families towork to receive public assistance. Minnesota's film industry also would get a $1 million boost. The money would go to theMinnesota Film Board to establish a filmproduction jobs program. It would pay pro-ducers of long-form and narrative films whodirectly create new film jobs in Minnesota.The Department of Trade and EconomicDevelopment would oversee and authorizethe payments. Below is a listing of some of the bill's other provisions: $6 million would go to the Minnesota Youth Program which provides servicesyear-round for young people between theages of 14 and 21. That dollar figure isabove the state base funding of about $6million. Participants receive education,skills training, and other support serviceson an individual basis. They receive aca-demic enrichment designed to improvethe young person's reading and math skills. $2.5 million would go to Mankato State University to establish a rural policy anddevelopment center to research issues af-fecting rural Minnesota, encourage col-laboration across higher educationinstitutions to help with problem solving,and provide a resource center for ruralcommunities. $300,000 would go to the Minnesota His- torical Society to distribute locally forMinnesota's territorial sesquicentennialand millennium celebrations. $250,000 would go to Ramsey County to expand the Sister-to-Sister mentoring pro-gram which pairs up former welfare moth-ers with those currently on welfare to helpthem move off public assistance. Thecounty would be required to match themoney. $25,000 would go to study the feasibility of a state museum housing fishing-relatedartifacts, equipment, and memorabilia. TheMinnesota Historical Society must presentstudy recommendations to the Legislature. $500,000 would pay for a LeRoy Neiman Museum of Art in St. Paul. A dollar-for-dollar match from other sources, however,is required. Neiman, an artist, is a native ofSt. Paul. $1 million would help low-income Minne- sotans pay household energy bills andweatherize their homes.May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 11Housing initiatives The omnibus bill also authorizes spend- ing $58.4 million in state funds on housingprograms, $5.4 million more than the gover-nor recommended. Homeless assistance, prevention The housing portion of the bill includes several programs to aid the homeless andprevent homelessness. According to Depart-ment of Economic Security figures, the num-ber of people using emergency shelters andtransitional housing in the state has tripledover the past 11 years. Of the 4,981 Minneso-tans needing services in 1996, 44 percentwere children. Any increase in homelessnesstriggered by federal and state welfare re-forms going into effect this year could strainan already overburdened support system. The largest appropriation would mark $5.7 million for the Family Homeless Preventionand Assistance Program, which grants fundsto organizations providing case managementto help low-income people with poor rentalhistories rehabilitate their rental records andfind housing. Part of the funding would alsogo to innovative approaches for housingpeople with poor rental histories. The bill provides $3.1 million for rental housing assistance to individuals sufferingfrom a mental illness and to families with amentally ill adult member. A $1.2 million program will help families experiencing financial hardships who areabout to lose their homes to foreclosure. Affordable rental housing The Affordable Rental Investment Fund would get $14.6 million for the biennium toprovide no-interest first mortgages or de-ferred loans for the construction of low-income rental housing. The aim of thisprogram is to provide affordable housing forhouseholds earning up to 80 percent of thestate median income. Indian housing programs Home ownership and rental opportuni- ties for low- and moderate-income Ameri-can Indians would be provided by twoprograms. The Urban Indian Housing Pro-gram would receive $187,000 per year toassist Indians living in urban areas. The TribalIndian Housing Program would get $1.7million each year to help Indians living inGreater Minnesota. Homestead support The Minnesota Urban and Rural Home- steading Program would get $186,000 peryear to acquire vacant, condemned, or aban-doned single-family homes for rehabilita- tion and sale. The properties are offered tofirst-time homeowners on a contract-for-deed basis. Accessibility Loan Program A program that provides deferred pay- ment loans to low-income homeowners forimprovements directly related to the basichousing needs of physically disabled personswould receive $4.3 million per year. Theprogram is operated by local agencies and islimited to households in which one or morepersons have a long-term disability that sub-stantially affects functioning in the home. Acquisition and demolition A $750,000 appropriation requested by House Speaker Phil Carruthers (DFL Brook-lyn Center) would pay for the acquisition,demolition, and removal of substandard multi-unit rental property. The measure was addedto the bill even though some members ques-tioned whether it would run counter to exist-ing state housing policy and lead to an actualdecrease in available low-income housing. DWI Tougher DWI sanctions An omnibus DWI bill cleared the House floor May 19 without the controversial pro-vision to lower drivers' legal blood alcohollimit to 0.08 percent. The vote was 85-47.That provision, passed by the House butapplied only to repeat offenders by a Senateproposal, was deleted by conferees. The 0.08 provision had been criticized by some who said it would unnecessarilycriminalize people and did not accuratelyreflect the facts about alcohol impairment. But Rep. Matt Entenza (DFL-St. Paul), the bill's House sponsor, said the new stan-dard would save lives. A House ResearchDepartment report states that based on stud-ies of other states, the lower level could saveabout 14 lives every year in Minnesota andabout $6.3 million in associated social costs. HF1004/SF985* is an effort to tighten laws that discourage and prohibit driving whileunder the influence of alcohol. Last year inMinnesota, police made 38,900 DWI arrests,a significant jump from the year before, when33,355 arrests were made, according to AlanRodgers of the Minnesota Department ofPublic Safety. Of 576 traffic deaths in Minnesota in 1996, about 202 were alcohol-related. Nationwide,alcohol played a role in 17,000 of 40,000 traffic deaths. Over the next biennium the bill would appropriate $248,000 to the public safetydepartment; $171,000 to the attorneygeneral's office; and $22,000 to the Board ofPublic Defense for costs associated with thebill. (Sec. 73, Subd. 1-3) Despite the disappearance of the 0.08 per- cent provision, a measure to lower to 0.04the legal limit for drivers under age 19 re-mains. (Sec. 28, Subd. 1) While state law prohibits any alcohol con- sumption by people under 21, the 0.04 pro-vision would make it easier to apply DWIpenalties to youthful offenders. The bill also would stiffen penalties for DWI offenses, especially for repeat offensesand for driving with a blood-alcohol level of0.20 (twice the legal limit) or more. A newlevel of DWI crime, called an enhanced grossmisdemeanor, would be imposed for threeor more DWI violations within 10 years, orfor a second or greater violation if the of-fense involves a blood-alcohol level of 0.20or more. Under the new classification, anoffender could receive up to two years in jailand a $3,000 fine A first DWI offense at a blood alcohol level of 0.20 or more would now be a gross misde-meanor, subject to a minimum sentence of30 days incarceration (with work release); 48hours consecutive incarceration; or 80 hoursof community service. The period of driver'slicense revocation would double. (A firstDWI offense is now a misdemeanor; thesecond, a gross misdemeanor.) After onemotor vehicle DWI offense at 0.20, licenseplates would be impounded. After two DWIconvictions, the vehicle could be forfeited,and a driver's license would be revoked fortwice the current length of time. (Sec. 38) Mandatory criminal penalties also would be increased. A third offense would result ina minimum 90-day jail sentence, with atleast 30 days served. A fourth would mean aminimum 180-day sentence with at least 30days served. A fifth or greater offense wouldmean a one-year sentence with at least 60days served. (Sec. 32, Subd. 3) In all three cases, the remainder of any sentence not served must be served on homedetention using electronic monitoring orunder an intensive probation program, dur-ing which no alcohol consumption is per-mitted. The bill provides for a greatlyincreased use of the high-tech monitoring,which enables law enforcers to obtain breathtest results through the telephone. (Sec. 37,Subd. 3f) Additionally, those awaiting trial could12 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYagree to electronic alcohol monitoring as a means of being released from detention, andmonitoring could be used as part of a sen-tence after a conviction. People with two ormore convictions within five years (or threeor more within 10 years) would participatein monitoring in addition to other proba-tion or sentencing conditions. The bill alsosays that the offender may be required to paythe cost of the monitoring. (Sec. 28, Subd.1c; Sec. 30, Subd. 1d) Drivers of snowmobiles, motor boats, and other off-road recreational vehicles, such asall-terrain vehicles, would be subject to thesame DWI laws that apply to automobiledrivers. Most sanctions, including the loss ofa driver's license, would apply only to repeatoffenders. All offenders would continue tobe subject to a misdemeanor penalty andlose operating privileges pertaining to thatrecreational vehicle after a first offense, inaccordance with current law. (Sec. 2, Subd.1.; Sec. 4, Subd. 1) A \"not-a-drop\" standard would apply to school bus drivers. That means any alcoholdetected could result in the loss of a driver'slicense. Currently, bus drivers are subject to a0.04 blood-alcohol level. Drivers of commer-cial vehicles would be breaking the law with alevel of 0.04 or more. (Sec. 42, Subd. 1) Finally, the bill would direct the commis- sioner of public safety to undertake a publicawareness campaign to educate the publicon the license plate impoundment and ve-hicle forfeiture laws. (Sec. 71) HF1004/SF985* now awaits the governor's signature. A DWI bill is on its way to the governor's desk without a controversial provision to lower the legalblood alcohol limit to 0.08 percent. EDUCATIONSCHOOL K-12 omnibus bill Gov. Arne Carlson is expected to veto a $6.7 billion K-12 education finance packagepassed by the Legislature because the billdoes not include tax credits and expandedtax deductions for private school tuition andother education expenses. The omnibus K-12 finance bill ( HF1684*/ SF1925 ), sponsored by Rep. Becky Kelso, was approved by the House May 19 in thewaning hours of the legislative session. Thevote was 115-18. The Senate passed the billthe same day by a margin of 56-10. \"The governor has stated on several occa- sions that he intends to veto the bill,\" saidBrian Dietz, the governor's press secretary.\"I have no indication otherwise that it willnot be vetoed.\" The bill would add three days to the school year for all public schools and provide healthyincreases in the per-pupil funding schoolsreceive in general education revenue. Cur-rently, districts get $3,505 per pupil. The billwould add $76 per pupil in 1998 and another$79 in 1999. And the bill would provide $89.5 million to improve technology in schools and a $100-million increase in compensatory revenue tohelp students from low-income homes, es-pecially those children who have failed or arelikely to fail the state's basic skills test re-quired for high school graduation. \"We managed to fund the basic operating costs of education at an inflationary level,and along with that there are some signifi-cant steps toward reform,\" Kelso said.However, the bill does not include any- thing resembling the governor's proposal toprovide funds to parents for education ex-penses such as tutoring, computer hardwareand software purchases, and private schooltuition. The governor originally sought $150 mil- lion in tax credits and expanded tax deduc-tions for education expenses, but near theclose of session he offered a more modest$75 million plan as negotiations on the K-12finance bill progressed. Kelso said the governor's proposals would have required much-needed funding to betaken away from other portions of the edu-cation budget. \"It's not a trivial amount of money,\" Kelso said. \"There's no way we could have sub-tracted that amount from other things we'refunding in the K-12 bill without it having anegative impact.\" The governor was not satisfied with a counter-offer from DFL leaders on educa-tion to expand the tax deduction for educa-tion expenses and to provide a lesser amountin tax credits for parents of public schoolstudents. The DFL proposal would have al-lowed state funds to be used for costs oftutoring, remedial efforts, computer pur-chases, and other expenses, but not for pri-vate school tuition. Efforts to compromise stalled over the issue of allowing state funds to be used to payprivate school tuition. \"That was a deal-breaker,\" Dietz said.Kelso said any move to provide state money for private school tuition in the form of a taxcredit would be \"a major change ideologi-cally\" that most lawmakers do not favor. \"What the governor wanted was simply not there to give,\" Kelso said. \"There was notsupport for his proposal. There was not 51percent of the Minnesota House that wouldhave voted for it.\" The version of the K-12 funding bill that emerged from conference committee in-cluded many of the provisions earlier ap-proved by the House. The bill would provide$7.9 million to help students with limitedproficiency in English and $5 million toimplement a system of uniform, statewidetesting. Dietz said the bill is missing some of the governor's education initiatives \u2014 such as aplan to provide funds to help get more char-ter schools up and running \u2014 aside from hisproposed tax credits and deductions. But,Dietz said the bill is \"decent\" and would farebetter with the governor if some agreementcould have been reached on the issue of taxcredits and deductions.May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 13\"If the tax credit portion would have been included, the bill probably would have beensigned already,\" Dietz said. The probability of a veto means the issue of school finance will likely be the focus of aspecial session of the Legislature. Only thegovernor can call a special session, and he isexpected to do so. \"Right now, it's very hard to see where the common ground is,\" Kelso said. \"I can't lookdown this road right now and see where theend is.\" A new law will require uniform, statewide testing of third, fifth, and eighth graders beginning in the1997-1998 school year and a new brand of assessment of students at the high school level beginningno later than the 1999-2000 school year. Signed by the governorSigned by the governorStatewide testing Gov. Arne Carlson signed leg- islation into law May 12 that willrequire uniform, statewide test-ing of virtually all Minnesotapublic school students. The new law, effective May 13, will require uniform, statewide testing ofthird, fifth, and eighth graders beginning inthe 1997-1998 school year and a new brandof assessment of students at the high schoollevel beginning no later than the 1999-2000school year. Rep. Joe Opatz (DFL-St. Cloud), who sponsored the measure in the House, saidthe tests will be an integral part of the state'smove toward an education system that de-mands schools and students be more ac-countable for taxpayer funds invested ineducation. Statewide testing had been a controversial issue at the Capitol in years past, but this yearit drew bipartisan support. Proponents claimsuch testing would provide a reliable meansfor comparing the performance of schoolsand districts. The first law passed during the 1997 ses- sion ( HF1*/SF3/CH1 ) mandated that state- wide testing would begin during the1997-1998 school year. The latest statewidetesting law prescribes how that testing sys-tem will work. Under the law, the basic skills tests in reading and math \u2014 already required underthe state's graduation rule and first given tostudents in the eighth grade \u2014 will count asthe statewide tests for that age group. Third and fifth graders will be given tests selected by the Department of Children,Families and Learning. The department canuse a test it has developed or a nationallyrecognized test such as the CaliforniaAchievement Test or the Iowa Test of BasicSkills. Any test used in the statewide testingsystem will have to be aligned with the state'sgraduation standards.The new law also asks districts to assess the performance of students at the secondarylevel according to the standards within theProfile of Learning, a state-developed sys-tem of measurements of overall student per-formance, and a part of the newly developedgraduation standards. The law calls for the assessment of second- ary students to begin during the 1999-2000school year, but it leaves the choice of testinginstruments and processes to the commis-sioner of the Department of Children, Fami-lies and Learning. The commissioner is required to report to the Legislature in 1998 on plans for assess-ment at the high school level. The law allows only narrow exceptions to the statewide testing requirements. For ex-ample, students who are new to this countryand are not proficient in English will beexempt. Another provision in the law requires that the 1997-1998 test results from each schooland each district be used to establish a baselineagainst which their future performance couldbe measured. Test results will be reported to the public in three forms: a raw number representingthe mean score for each school and district,a mean score of all students except those whoare new to a school or district, and a meanscore of all students except those receivinglimited English proficiency instruction.The results released to the public also will include the number of students on free andreduced-price lunch programs, the numberof special education students, and the num-ber of students with limited English profi-ciency at each site. Sen. Larry Pogemiller (DFL-Mpls) spon- sored the measure in the Senate. HF2179*/SF1934/CH138 Spending caps removed The first new law produced during the 1997 session removedstatutory caps on educationspending and requires uniformstatewide testing of public schoolstudents. The law lifted a provision approved by lawmakers in 1995 that called for a $337million cut in state aid to school districtsduring the next two years. Considered a top priority at the start of the legislative session, the proposal to removethe spending caps won broad, bipartisansupport. Statewide testing was initially linked to the spending caps proposal through anamendment approved on the Senate floor.The legislation that the House originallypassed did not include any such language. The eventual result was legislation to do14 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYthree things: repeal the caps on education funding, repeal current law prohibiting state-wide testing, and establish that Minnesotawill require standardized testing of all stu-dents. Supporters of statewide testing tout it as a way to increase accountability in publicschools by providing a reliable measurementof student and school performance that canbe compared to results from other schoolsand districts. The specifics on how statewide testing will work are not included in the new law. Aspecial House-Senate committee was cre-ated to devise separate legislation ( HF2179 ) prescribing how statewide testing is to beimplemented. The repeal of the funding caps was effec- tive Feb. 15. Statewide testing will be re-quired beginning in the 1997-1998 schoolyear. The legislation was sponsored by Rep. Alice Johnson (DFL-Spring Lake Park) and Sen.Keith Langseth (DFL-Glyndon). HF1*/SF3/CH1 ELECTIONSSigned by the governor Signed by the governorPillows talk at the polls People in some areas of Minne- sota might want to carefully planwhich room of the house shouldbe the master bedroom. The de-cision could determine the loca-tion of their polling place. According to a new law, if an individual's home lies in more than one precinct, the\"official\" one would be \"the precinct in whicha majority of the room in which the indi-vidual usually sleeps is located.\" The provision has become necessary as more housing developments are being builton agricultural land which also serves tomark school district boundaries, accordingto Joe Mansky, director of the Elections Di-vision of the Office of the Secretary of State.No figures are available to determine thenumber of people the provision will affect. In addition to many technical changes, the law requires courts to provide the secre-tary of state's office with the names of con-victed felons (who are ineligible to vote),and of those whose voting rights have beenrestored after having served sentences forfelony crimes. The state currently has norecord-keeping capacity to keep track of suchconvicts. The law also says that candidates for county sheriff must be licensed peace officers. Un-der current law, candidates are obligated only to complete basic police training coursesbefore serving or campaigning. Effective Aug. 1, 1997, the law was spon- sored by Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL Hopkins)and Sen. John Marty (DFL-Roseville). HF127/SF72*/CH147 City council terms A new state law will ensure that members of the St. Paul CityCouncil will continue to serve atwo-year term. The Legislature passed election laws in 1994 and 1995 designed to get all municipalities on a fall ballotingschedule. But one of the unintended conse-quences of those changes was to make all citycouncil terms four years long, starting Jan. 1,1998. This was news to many declared candi- dates for the capital city council, who thoughtthey were vying for a two-year stint. Officials in St. Paul were outraged, and saw the law as a direct attack on the citycharter, which calls for two-year councilterms. (Voters in St. Paul rejected a changefrom two- to four-year terms with referen-dums held in 1984 and 1986.) State officials admitted they had no evil intentions when they drafted changes to stateelection law. They were just trying to get ridof some spring elections in the name ofuniformity. The new law becomes effective upon ap- proval of the St. Paul City Council. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Sharon Marko (DFL-Newport) and Sen.Chuck Wiger (DFL-White Bear Lake). HF658/SF612*/CH153 ENERGY The Legislature passed several new election laws this session: one increases the number ofMinnesotans able to vote by mail; another ensures that St. Paul City Council members continue toserve two-year terms; and, still another links your polling place to the bedroom.Vote by mail Under a new law effective Aug. 1, 1997, more Minnesotans willbe able to vote by mail. Under current law, rural cities and towns with 400 or fewer reg-istered voters are able to conduct mail-in elections. The new law will allowvoters in precincts with 50 or fewer voters tovote by mail. Adding the precinct designation, even with the smaller number of voters, allows moreareas to participate in mail-in voting. That'sbecause some towns with populations ofmore than 400 lie in more than one county,creating very small precincts within metro-politan areas. The law will allow those precincts to avoid the expense of operating a polling place andother election-related efforts for their lim-ited number of voters. House sponsor Rep. Jim Tunheim (DFL- Kennedy) has said the law will affect about284 registered voters statewide. Sen. Linda Scheid (DFL-Brooklyn Park) sponsored the proposal in the Senate. HF168/SF703*/CH145 Biomass and wind power Effective Aug. 1, 1997, a new law will remove a hurdle thatenergy-producing facilities nor-mally face before they can startdoing business. The facilities in this case are wind and biomass energy-producing plants.The law will remove the requirement thatthe plant owners obtain costly and time-consuming certificates of need \u2014 proof thatthe state needs the facility \u2014 before they canSigned by the governorSigned by the governorMay 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 15be built. The certificate process usually takes 18 months to three years. Not only does the state want to encourage the wind and biomass energy industry, it hasmandated that a major energy buyer in thestate, Northern States Power Co. (NSP),purchase a specified amount of energy fromthose sources. That means that without thenew provision, the state would be requiringa certificate of need from the same businessthe state already has mandated that NSP buyfrom. The law also gives the Public Utilities Com- mission regulatory authority over thebiomass and wind energy purchases madeby a utility company. Lastly, the law requires the Department of Agriculture to study funding mechanisms tomake biomass energy projects more viable.The study should look at tax-exempt bonds,public and private financing, the develop-ment of an authority to facilitate invest-ment, and credit payments. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Gary Kubly (DFL-Granite Falls) and Sen. DeanJohnson (R-Willmar). HF1508/SF1328*/176 ENVIRONMENT Environmental spending bill The omnibus environment, natural re- sources, and agriculture finance bill(HF2150 ) is now pending before the gover- nor. Under the revised bill, state spending for environment and agriculture programs willtotal almost $647 million over the next two-year budget cycle. Included are funds for theDepartment of Natural Resources (DNR),the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency(MPCA), the Minnesota Zoo, the Depart-ment of Agriculture, and several other stateagencies. Just over 62 percent of the state spending in the bill \u2014 almost $368.6 million \u2014 goesto the DNR. The MPCA, the next largestrecipient will receive about $86.7 million.The Department of Agriculture recieves $54.9million. The spending bill also includes $37.2 mil- lion for environmental and recreational pro-grams selected by the Legislative Commissionon Minnesota Resources (LCMR), which isfunded by a 2-cent-per-pack cigarette taxand some state lottery proceeds. (Sec. 15) The MPCA will continue existing pro- grams to clean up Minnesota lakes and riverswith $25.7 million in state funds. It willreceive another $16 million for air pollution programs, and almost $31.5 million for pro-tection of groundwater and management ofsolid waste. (Sec. 2) Highlights of the bill, sponsored by Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. SteveMorse (DFL-Dakota) are below. Fishing license fees Both residents and nonresidents would have to pay more to wet a line in Minnesotalakes and rivers. Annual licenses for residents would be $15, up from the current $13. Minnesotaseniors would see a $1 hike and would pay$5.50 instead of $4.50 per year. Nonresidents would pay $31, up from $27.50 per year. Fees would also be raised for temporary fishing licenses, fish houses, and trout stampsfor residents and nonresidents alike. (Sec.83) Ethanol The bill would appropriate $49.6 million in subsidies over the two-year period forethanol producers. Ethanol is made from the fermentation of corn and other agricultural products andhas been used as an additive in gasoline tomake it burn more cleanly. There are currently six major ethanol plants in Minnesota that produce a total of92 million gallons of ethanol per year. Thatis still short of the 120 million-gallon stategoal which would allow Minnesota to be-come ethanol self-sufficient. The state stillimports ethanol from plants in Illinois, Iowa,and Nebraska. Since October 1995, automobiles in the 10-county metropolitan area have been re- A $600,000 appropriation in the omnibus environment bill would go to the DNR for a new electronicgame and fish licensing system. quired to burn \"oxygenated fuel\" year round.(The law was enacted in 1991 because theTwin Cities was in violation of federal Envi-ronmental Protection Agency clean air re-quirements. Adding one part ethanol forevery 10 parts of gas is one way to oxygenategas.) Beginning Oct. 1, 1997, all gasoline sold in the state will have to be oxygenated, whichwill further increase demand for ethanol.(Sec. 7, Subd. 3) Snowmobile safety, trails The bill increases the snowmobile regis- tration fee by $15, pushing the total chargeto $45 for three years. The bill also requiresout-of-state snowmobilers to pay $15 for apermit to operate their machines on statetrails or grants-in-aid trails maintained bylocal clubs. New revenue generated by thefee increases will help pay for improvementsto an overburdened and out-of-date trailsystem. The bill also would expand snowmobile safety training requirements to include allsnowmobile operators 25 and under by 2002.Safety training also would be required of anyoperator convicted of careless or recklessoperation of a snowmobile and those whoviolate snowmobile speed limits twice withinone season. The bill also prohibits the use of snowmo- biles with metal traction devices on pavedstate trails. (Sec. 64) A total of $5.2 million will be spent each year for snowmobile trail improvements.Most of the money will go to local snowmo-bile clubs to pay for trail grooming under thestate grants-in-aid program. (Sec. 5, Subd.6) Local law enforcement agencies will beable to apply for grants from a $800,000 fund16 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYto expand their snowmobile enforcement activities. The DNR also will get $200,000 forspecial equipment to increase the effective-ness and safety of snowmobile law enforce-ment. (Sec. 5, Subd. 8) State parks, trails, recreation Funding for state parks and recreation areas would total more than $53.8 million. A total of $6 million \u2014 $3 million each year \u2014 would go to maintain and operatethe metropolitan regional park system. An-other $500,000 more would go to expandand improve state park and recreational ar-eas. (An additional $7 million from theLCMR would supplement the funds formetropolitan and state parks.) A $75,000 appropriation is for predesign and design for a Minnesota rock, gem, andmineral interpretative center to be locatedwithin Moose Lake state park near primerock collecting areas. The DNR would ini-tiate the architectural and engineering de-sign for the center, the focal point of whichwould be the display of Lake Superior agatesas well as rocks, gems, minerals, and geologicartifacts indigenous to Minnesota. (Sec. 5,Sud. 5) Trail improvements include $900,000 for the gateway segment of the Willard MungerTrail in North St. Paul and Roseville. Othertrails to be improved include the HeartlandTrail, Root River Trail, and Harmony Trail.(Sec. 5, Subd. 6) Another $142,000 would fund a survey of state trails accessible to people with disabili-ties. (Sec. 5, Subd. 9)Fish and wildlife The DNR will spend more than $82.3 million in fiscal years 1998 and 1999 onprograms for fish and wildlife management. Non-game wildlife management programs will get $1.9 million. Another $2.7 millionwill fund game and fish critical habitat pro-grams and wetlands protection under theReinvest in Minnesota (RIM) program. (Sec.5, Subd. 7) The LCMR recommendations add another $3.2 million for RIM programs. Stagecoach Trail The bill authorizes the creation of a 40- mile historic trail through Dodge, Olmsted,and Steele counties. The Stagecoach Trailwill originate at the Douglas Trail near Roch-ester and extend west along the ZumbroRiver Valley to Owatonna. Paralleling U.S.Route 14, the trail will pass throughMantorville, Wasioja, and Rice Lake StatePark. Rep. Steve Sviggum (R-Kenyon), sponsor of the original trail legislation, had explainedthat the multi-purpose paved trail will beused primarily for biking and hiking. Un-paved portions of the trail would be devel-oped for horseback riding, mountain biking,and snowmobiling. No funding is allocatedfor trail development this year. (Sec. 65) Livestock odor research The bill requires the MPCA to monitor livestock feedlots for violations of the state'sambient air quality standards for hydrogensulfide emissions. The agency must respondto citizen complaints about feedlot odor anduse portable monitoring equipment. (Sec.115) The University of Minnesota would re-ceive $400,000 for livestock odor research. Another $125,000 would go to the Minne-sota Institute for Sustainable Agriculture forresearch, development, and promotion oflow odor alternative hog production systems. Deer winter survival HF2150 includes a provision authorizing the DNR, along with members of the Minne-sota Deer Hunters Association, to form aworking group and develop recommenda-tions on feeding and other options to ensurethe winter survival of deer. Winter deer feeding has been a matter of controversy for several years. Opponentsargue that the state spends too much inmoney and staff time on deer feeding anddoesn't save enough deer to make it worth-while. Deer feeding supporters, such as Rep.Tom Bakk (DFL-Cook), argue that such criti-cism fails to take public support for theprogram into account. Million of state dol-lars have been spent and thousands of vol-unteers have distributed food for deer overthe past several years. (Sec. 144) Electronic licensing A $600,000 appropriation would go to the DNR for a new electronic game and fishlicensing system. License agents would be able to run the magnetic strip on Minnesota driver's licensesthrough their equipment to pull up personalinformation to print on the buyer's fish orgame license. License fees also could be elec-tronically transferred. The DNR would con-tract with a private vendor to operate thesystem. A pilot project is planned for the summer and fall of 1998 with full implementationplanned for March 1999. (Sec. 5, Subd. 9) Food stamp supplement $1 million is allocated to create and ad- minister a \"Minnesota Grown\" coupon pro-gram to provide food supplements toMinnesota residents who are non-citizenswho have lost their eligibility for federal foodstamps The coupons will be redeemable forMinnesota-grown produce and meat prod-ucts. (Sec. 7, Subd. 3) White pines The oldest, tallest, and most majestic trees in Minnesota's forests are the white pine.But with only 2 percent of the state's originalwhite pine population still standing, conser-vationists, the timber industry, and stateofficials are all concerned about the tree'sfuture.

Signed by the governor Signed by the governorChanges to state parks Land would be added to four state parks, an additional park would get a new name,and another would be allowed to sell beer inits lodge under a bill passed by the HouseMay 19. The vote was 133-0. HF299 , sponsored by Rep. Tom Bakk (DFL-Cook), authorizes the Department ofNatural Resources to add land to the follow-ing state parks. Bear Head Lake State Park in St. Louis County would add 160 acres of adjacentundeveloped land, wooded with maturered and white pine trees. The additionwould prevent a proposed housing devel-opment near the Taconite State Trail. Forestville State Park in Fillmore County would get an adjacent 40-acre parcel onthe south branch of the Root River. Theriver is a designated trout stream and thesurrounding bluffs contain excellent habi-tat for the endangered timber rattlesnake. John Latsch State Park in Winona County would gain access to the Mississippi Riverwith a 120-acre parcel that includes pri-vately owned water access, a resort, andcampground. The resort would continueto be privately operated under contractwith the state and would be allowed to sell liquor by the drink. Split Rock Lighthouse State Park in Lake County would acquire 80 acres of landalong the Lake Superior shore northeast ofthe park. The land is currently owned bythe Congdon family and includes GoldRock Point, the largest of the few exposedgranite cliffs on the North Shore. It alsocontains 3,700 feet of lake shore and accessto the Madeira shipwreck, one of the mostpopular diving sites in the Great Lakes. The bill also changes the name of O.L. Kipp State Park in Winona County to GreatRiver Bluffs State Park. O.L. Kipp is the firststate park encountered by travelers enteringthe state from the east on Interstate 90. GreatRiver Bluffs is a more descriptive name thatpark officials believe will attract more tour-ists to the park. Another provision of the bill would allow Itasca State Park in Clearwater County toadd beer to the wine menu in its restaurant.And visitors to Tettegouche State Park wouldbe allowed to use the Palisade Head parkinglot for up to one hour without buying a statepark permit. The Senate added a provision to the bill authorizing St. Louis County to sell tax-forfeited land along Amity Creek in Duluth. The bill now goes to the governor. Mercury emissions regulated New rules regulating incinera- tor mercury emissions will be-come law on Aug. 1, 1997. Under the new law, mercury testing procedures will be relaxedfor incinerators with a proven track record of low emissions. New incinera-tors will be required to run a smokestackmercury test every three months. The billallows incinerator operators with emissionsbelow 50 percent of their permitted mercurylimit for three consecutive years to cut backtesting to once every three years. If any subsequent test reveals mercury emissions greater than 50 percent of theincinerator's permitted mercury limit, thefacility will have to conduct yearly stack sam-pling until emissions once again drop below50 percent. The purpose of the new law is to reward superior performance, Peter Torkelson, astaff engineer for the Minnesota PollutionControl Agency has said. Most mercury in the environment origi- nates from incinerator smokestacks. Burn-ing of municipal wastes and fossil fuels, oftento generate electricity, are the primary sourcesof smokestack mercury. Once airborne, mer- cury eventually returns to earth and con-taminates the watershed. Studies of the sludgeaccumulated on Minnesota lake bottomsindicate that the state's mercury problemsstarted with industrialization in the 1850sand peaked in the 1970s. Since then the rateof mercury contamination has droppedslightly. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Janet Johnson(DFL-North Branch). HF742/SF780*/CH189 Relays added to mercury law A bill regulating mercury-con- taining products was signed byGov. Arne Carlson April 28. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can cause permanent ner-vous system damage. Since mer- cury is a volatile element it does not degradein the environment, but becomes airborneand eventually returns to earth to contami-nate watersheds. It also accumulates in ani-mal tissue as it moves up the food chain.Consumption of fish from 90 percent ofMinnesota's lakes is currently restricted be-cause of mercury contamination. The law, sponsored in the House by Rep. Jean Wagenius (DFL-Mpls), adds commer-cial electrical relays to a list of products fromwhich mercury must be removed for reuseor recycling prior to disposal. The new re-striction takes effect July 1, 1998. \"When we originally passed the bill to regulate mercury recycling in products, weleft out electrical relays,\" Wagenius said onthe House floor March 20. \"These relays areshowing up in the waste stream and need tobe included [in the law].\" Regulations currently in effect include such devices as thermostats, thermometers, andswitches. Manufacturers are required to la-bel all mercury-containing products and ac-cept them back for recycling or properdisposal. Sen. Janet Johnson (DFL-North Branch) sponsored the Senate proposal. HF949*/SF885/CH62 Earth Day Gov. Arne Carlson signed a resolution April 29 asking theU.S. Congress to recognize EarthDay as a national day of serviceand education. The resolution, which also es- tablishes Earth Day as a state day of serviceSigned by the governor18 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY and education, requires the secretary of state to transmit the state's wishes to the presidentand leaders in Congress. Earth Day, which falls on April 22, has been celebrated informally by environmen-tally concerned citizens since the spring of1970, when environmental leaders staged anationwide \"teach-in.\" The day is often marked with volunteer environmental cleanup efforts and publiceducation programs. Earth Day has now goneinternational with programs planned in sev-eral countries. Rep. Willard Munger (DFL-Duluth) spon- sored the resolution the Township) was theSenate sponsor. HF1692/SF1342*/Res. 4Gov. Arne Carlson signed a resolution April 29 asking the U.S. Congress to recognize Earth Day as anational day of service and education. FAMILY Early childhood funding Federal changes requiring wel- fare parents to work are expectedto move another 12,500 Minne-sota children into day care overthe next few years. To preparefor that onslaught, a new state law sets aside a record $200.4 million. The measure also will pay some parents to stay at home with their newborns for the firstyear of life. Gov. Arne Carlson signed the omnibus early childhood and family education billinto law May 16. It spends $393.6 millionover the state's 1998-1999 two-year budget-ing period.In addition to child care, the new law, much of which is effective July 1, 1997, ap-propriates money for programs such as earlychildhood education, community education,after school programs, adult basic educa-tion, Head Start, food shelves, and homelessshelters. Providing the dollars for child care is in the state's best interest, lawmakers say. Un-der a new federal welfare law, states are pun-ished for not moving their welfare parents towork. Specifically, Minnesota could losemillions in federal aid. Logically, if Minne-sota expects its welfare parents to work, childcare assistance is essential. Part of the $200.4 million for child care \u2014 $99 million \u2014 will pay for the child careneeds of welfare parents now required towork under federal law. (Art. 4, Sec. 63,Subd. 3) About $92.5 million will be placed into an existing program that helps low- and mod-erate-income working families pay for childcare using an income-based, sliding-fee scale.There are currently about 5,600 Minnesotafamilies on a waiting list for the Basic SlidingFee program. The money in the new law isexpected to eliminate most, if not all, of thewaiting list. (Art. 4, Sec. 63, Subd. 2) The Basic Sliding Fee program has be- come a vital part of the state's effort to trimits welfare rolls. Without the program, thecost of child care can often push a working-poor family onto welfare. A portion of the Basic Sliding Fee dollars will pay parents on the program to stay athome with their child for the first year of life. Eligible families (those already qualified for the Basic Sliding Fee program) will re-ceive 75 percent of the average cost of li-censed family home day care for an infant in their county. The measure instructs the De-partment of Children, Families and Learn-ing to begin the program by July 1, 1998.(Art. 4, Sec. 22) Another $7.7 million will go toward child care development grants to encourage morepeople to enter the child care profession byoffering loans for course work and training.A portion of the money also would be usedto expand child care facilities. And finally, the remaining $1 million will be used to administer the programs. Below is a listing of some of the new law's highlights. A mandatory $5 monthly co-payment for families using state-subsidized child carewill be instituted. Families with incomesbetween 75 and 100 percent of the federalpoverty level will be required to make a $5co-payment each month, regardless of howmany children they have. For a family oftwo, 75 percent of the poverty level equals Besides a record $200.4 million for child caresubsidies, the omnibus early childhood andfamily education law spends $29.7 million to payfor a program that brings babies and toddlerstogether with their parents to learn about achild's emotional, physical, mental, andeducational development. Signed by the governorMay 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 19$7,957 and 100 percent equals $10,610. The co-payments will increase for familiesearning more than 100 percent of the pov-erty level. (Art. 4, Sec. 37, Subd. 2) $29.7 million over the two-year budgeting period will pay for a program that bringsbabies and toddlers together with theirparents to learn about a child's emotional,physical, mental, and educational devel-opment. The Early Childhood Family Edu-cation (ECFE) program is a 23-year-oldprogram designed for children from birthto kindergarten and their parents. (Art. 1,Sec. 18, Subd. 3) $2 million will fund a newly created early childhood infant grant development pro-gram. It will provide money to local ECFEprograms that come up with creative waysto focus on infant development and aparent's role in stimulating and nurturingtheir infant's intellectual and emotionaldevelopment. (Art. 1, Sec. 18, Subd. 7) $9.8 million will pay for after-school en- richment programs. Grants are providedto select neighborhoods so they may offerafter-school programs for 9- to 13-year-olds. The program's purpose is to reducejuvenile crime, school suspensions, andincrease student achievement. (Art. 2, Sec.31, Subd. 11) $37.5 million will pay for Head Start, a federal/state program that provides low-income preschool children with emotional,social, health, nutritional, and psychologi-cal services. (Art. 1, Sec. 18, Subd. 8) $25 million will pay for adult basic educa- tion over the biennium. The program pro-vides educational opportunities for adultswith low educational levels. Services in-clude literacy training, work force educa-tion, and General EducationalDevelopment (GED) preparation. (Art. 2,Sec. 31, Subd. 18) $2.5 million will pay for Minnesota food shelves. The increase is in anticipation ofan even greater demand on food shelvesthis spring when many of Minnesota's poorwill see a cut in their federal food stamps.(Art. 3, Sec. 8, Subd. 4) Rep. Tony Kinkel (DFL-Park Rapids) and Sen. Pat Piper (DFL-Austin) sponsored thelegislation. HF2147*/SF1858/CH162Signing up for fatherhood A bill to register the names of fathers \u2014 or potential fathers \u2014 with the state is on itsway to the governor. HF296/SF203* would require the Depart- ment of Health to establish a registry for menwho want to be notified if their child is putup for adoption. The registry would be for any male who is or may be a child's father but is not marriedto the mother and has not otherwise estab-lished paternity. The bill is aimed mainly atcouples who have little or no relationshipbeyond the time of conception. The registry would protect a birth father's rights in the event his child is put up foradoption, and protect children and adoptiveparents from having their families \"rippedapart,\" House sponsor Rep. Linda Wejcman(DFL-Mpls) has said. A father or potential father could register from the time of conception until 30 daysafter a child's birth. (A man would be able toregister even without certainty that a preg-nancy resulted from a sexual encounter.) A father who does not register within 30 days of a child's birth would not \u2014 undermost circumstances \u2014 be allowed to contestan adoption. By failing to register, a father\"is considered to have abandoned the child.\" Registering also would serve as the first step in a paternity claim. Within 30 daysafter being notified of a pending adoption,the father could file with the court an intentto claim parental rights. That way, a fatherwould preserve the right to maintain an in-terest in the child. The bill would apply only to parental rights related to adoptions \u2014 not to custody orother parental issues. It would affect babiesborn on and after Jan. 1, 1998. The omnibus health and human services finance bill ( SF1908 ) carries a $286,000 ap- propriation to get the registry up and run-ning.

The law allows tournaments or contests involving social skill games \u2014 in-cluding cribbage, skat, sheephead, bridge,euchre, pinochle, gin, 500, smear, and whist\u2014 as long as the events do not provide a direct financial benefit to the host organiza-tion, and the sum of all prizes does notexceed $200. The games in question are gen-erally held at VFW posts, American Legionhalls, Moose and Elk lodges, Knights of Co-lumbus halls, and senior citizen centers. Of-ten, a fee is charged for participation in thegames, and the winner or winners in thegames may win part of the door fee. Another provision increases by 5 percent the amount that organizations that host le-gal gambling, such as bingo, can claim asexpenses. Previous law said that 60 percentof the gross profits from bingo and 50 per-cent from other legal gambling can be claimedfor expenses. The law raises the amounts to65 percent and 55 percent, respectively. Lastly, the law eases up on the owners of premises where illegal gambling has takenplace. Before the owner's permit can be re-voked, the Gambling Control Board has toprove that the owner knew the unlawfulactivity was occurring. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Mike Delmont (DFL-Lexington) and Sen. JimVickerman (DFL-Tracy). HF700/SF566*/CH155 Game, fish, and snowmobiles This year's omnibus game and fish bill would regulate snowmobiles, provide youthdeer licenses, and declare opposums to be anofficial state nuisance. HF313/SF254* , sponsored by Rep. Bob Milbert (DFL-South St. Paul) and Sen. Den-nis Frederickson (R-New Ulm), is on its wayto the governor. Under the bill, snowmobiles would have to be registered in the legal name of theowner and registration numbers must beclearly visible on the vehicle for law enforce-ment purposes. In the past, owners havebeen allowed to register under nicknamesand use fancy (and often difficult to read)lettering to display registration numbers ontheir snowmobiles. These practices some-times made it difficult for enforcement per-sonnel to identify a snowmobile's owner.Snowmobilers under 18 also would be re-quired to wear helmets. In addition, the bill would prohibit the operation of airboats at any time on lakesdesignated for wildlife management pur-poses.20 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY GOVERNMENT Signed by the governorYoung deer hunters Young people would be encouraged to take up hunting by two provisions of the bill.A $5 youth deer license would be authorizedallowing residents under age 16 to hunt deer.With the license, youth must be accompa-nied by a licensed hunter 18 years of age orolder who possesses a valid deer tag. Anydeer taken by the youth would have to betagged by the older hunter. The commis-sioner of the Department of Natural Re-sources (DNR) also would be authorized toestablish special hunts for youth to take bigor small game in designated areas. Playing with opposums Opossums would join the list of nuisance animals that could be taken without permitby the occupant of a property where theanimal is causing damage. Already on the listare mink, squirrel, rabbit, hare, raccoon,lynx, bobcat, fox, muskrat and beaver. Thisprovision also says that a DNR conservationofficer must be notified when such an ani-mal is killed. Current law requires that theanimal be brought to an officer. Gun safety The DNR would be authorized under the bill to set up a two-year pilot program topromote the safe use and storage of firearms.The program is to be \"value-neutral\" con-cerning gun ownership. The demonstrationprogram would be conducted in two schooldistricts: one in the Twin Cities metropoli-tan area and one in Greater Minnesota. Areport on the pilot program would be sub-mitted to the Legislature by Jan. 15, 1999. Assistant anglers allowed Anglers who need help wetting their fishing lines due to age,blindness, or disability will get abreak under a new law effectiveAug. 1, 1997. The disabled currently receive free fishing licenses but those assisting themoften must pay for a separate license. Thelaw, sponsored in the House by Rep. DarleneLuther (DFL-Brooklyn Park), will allow agedand disabled people to be assisted by anunlicensed person as long as only one line isin the water. \"One of my constituents, Mark Jacobson, of Brooklyn Park, brought the problem tomy attention,\" Luther has said. Jacobson'smother is disabled and needs assistance topursue her favorite sport. Since she has sev-eral different assistants, Jacobson found hewould have to pay for a separate fishing license for each assistant. Sen. Linda Scheid (DFL-Brooklyn Park) sponsored the Senate proposal. HF311/SF574*/CH95 Financing state government The House approved a $654 million om- nibus state government finance bill May 16.The vote was 92-39. In addition to funding the legislative and administrative functions of state govern-ment, SF1905 also funds a number of other projects, most notably: $15,000 for a portraitof Gov. Arne Carlson and $15,000 for an oilpainting replica of former Gov. Rudy Perpichand his wife, Lola; $200,000 for the HockeyHall of Fame in Eveleth, Minn., (which hasoperated at a loss for years); and $450,000for an American Bald Eagle Center inWabasha, Minn. SF1905 also would allow the Legislature to increase the number ofpaid leadership positions. Under the bill,each legislative house could expand its lead-ership from three positions to five, each ofwhom would be paid at 140 percent of therank-and-file members, or $41,519, up from$29,657. (Art. 2, Sec. 3) The version of SF1905 adopted by the House contains substantially fewer provi-sions than previous editions. As the bill pro-ceeded through the legislative process,members deleted language pertaining to rais-ing the minimum wage, providing pay in- creases for the state's top executives andjudges, and purchasing the Minnesota Twins. SF1905 , sponsored in the House by Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL-Virginia) and in theSenate by Sen. Len Price (DFL-Woodbury)now goes to the governor for his signature. Appropriations For the 1998-99 biennium, the bill would appropriate more than $100 million in oper-ating funds for the Legislature, $53 millionfor the attorney general's office, and $7 mil-lion for the offices of the governor and thelieutenant governor. SF1905 also would fund a number of diverse state initiatives, in addi-tion to the gubernatorial portraits and theeagle center, through the Department ofAdministration. The department's biennialappropriation, which totals nearly $95 mil-lion, includes projects such as the Children'sMuseum and the Intergovernmental Infor-mation Systems Advisory Council. (Art. 1,Sec. 12) The bill also would strengthen the state's debt collection agency. Under SF1905 , debts owed to any state government entity thatbecome more than 121 days past due wouldhave to be collected through the MinnesotaCollection Enterprise. The Legislature es-tablished the collection enterprise severalyears ago to collect debts in a more costeffective manner. Monuments to posterity SF1905 would appropriate slightly more than $1 million to the Capitol Area Architec- Among its many spending projects, the omnibus state government finance bill would spend $15,000for an oil painting replica of former Gov. Rudy Perpich and his wife, Lola, to be displayed in theCapitol. Before he died, Perpich tried to include his wife in his official Capitol portrait but was denied.The above photograph of Perpich and his wife would be replaced with the painting.May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 21tural and Planning Board for new monu- ments. The bill would allocate $455,000 in 1998 for the two gubernatorial portraits, thepredesign of a monument dedicated to CoyaKnutson (the state's first female congres-sional representative), and the completionof the Women's Suffrage Memorial Garden. The planning board also would be di- rected to develop standards regarding gu-bernatorial portraits, paying \"particularattention to whether the governor's spouseshould be included in the official portrait.\"(Art. 1, Sec. 14) Another $110,000 would fund a matching grant for a memorial to be constructed inPark Rapids, Minn., honoring veterans from\"all wars involving armed forces of the UnitedStates.\" (Art. 1, Sec. 19) Prescription drugs SF1905 also allocates $250,000 over the biennium to the Department of Administra-tion to establish a prescription drug-buyingprogram. (Art. 1, Sec. 12) The program would allow the department to establish a consortium to purchase phar-maceuticals in bulk. The drugs would, inturn, be sold to pharmacists who would thenpass the savings \u2014 estimated at 10 percent ofcurrent prices \u2014 on to consumers. (Art. 2,Secs. 28-31) Technology The bill would elevate the state's Office of Technology to the status of a state agency,with an executive director appointed by thegovernor. The office would be responsiblefor ensuring that all of the state's technologi-cal development proceeds in a logical man-ner. The technology office would review andcoordinate intergovernmental operating sys-tems, and direct the architecture of the state'stechnology infrastructure. (Art. 3, Secs. 7-10) The technology office's director also would appoint a manager for Minnesota's NorthStar system, which would become the offi-cially sanctioned on-line service for con-ducting government business. Governmentunits planning or providing on-line services(such as World Wide Web pages) would berequired to do so through North Star, andthe office would develop outreach programsto other statewide systems, such as schoolsand libraries. (Art. 3, Sec 13) SF1905 also would enhance Minnesota's 911 service, requiring cellular and wirelessaccess providers to cooperate and imple-ment an enhanced emergency capability thatmeets the standards dictated by the FederalCommunications Commission. (Currently, a number of rural Minnesota counties arewithout enhanced 911 service, which allowsa dispatcher's computer terminal to pin-point the exact location of a caller.) The Minnesota Highway Patrol and other civic entities would operate 10 answeringpoints, and the local governments would berequired to ensure that any 911 call made bya cellular phone would be automatically con-nected to one of those points. (Art. 3, Secs.18-31) Community-based planning SF1905 also contains provisions aimed at reining in urban sprawl. Under the bill, com-munities would be encouraged to work to-gether and prepare comprehensive growthplans, in concert with the state's Office ofStrategic and Long-Range Planning and otheragencies. The legislation builds on 11 goals for growth outlined by the Metropolitan Coun-cil. Accordingly, municipalities could estab-lish joint powers boards to oversee thedevelopment process by assembling a long-range blueprint for growth which incorpo-rates the Met Council's ideas. Communitiesthat chose to do so would be required tosubmit the outline to the state's planningoffice for review and comment. (Art. 4, Secs.1-12) Grant funds of $375,000 for the second year of the biennium would encourage coun-ties or joint planning districts to adopt sucha plan. A grant of $350,000 the first year ofthe biennium would be available to a jointpowers board in the St. Cloud area to ad-dress community planning. Three grants of $50,000 would await additional counties orboards willing to participate in a planningpilot project. (Art. 1, Sec. 11) The bill would establish an advisory coun- cil on community-based planning, whichwould be required to report back to the 1998Legislature with ideas on how to better imple-ment community-based ideas. The 18-mem-ber council would hold state-wide meetings,encourage citizen involvement, and developstrategies for coordinating growth plans.(Art. 4, Sec. 13) The bill also creates an alternative dispute resolution process that would allow com-munities to address any conflicts that mightarise out of the planning process. (Art. 6) Year 2000 glitch None of the accounting software programs used throughout the vast network of stateoffices know what to make of the digits \"00\"when used to signify a year \u2014 such as theyear 2000. Nor can they accommodate afour-digit year code. So at the turn of the millenium, millions of transactions will become impossible, suchas writing paychecks, paying Medicare andMedicaid bills, or paying vendors. The bill provides up to $23 million over the biennium to solve the problem. Of that amount, $8 million will be held and spent only if the governor gives his ap-proval, after consulting with the LegislativeAdvisory Commission. The Department of Administration will report to the Legislature by Dec. 15 of thisyear on the progress of the project. (Art. 1, House computers The 1997 Legislative Session marks the first year all House members had access to laptopcomputers to cut down on the whirlwind of paper moving across their desks. Using thecomputers, members could access the text of bills as well as receive e-mail messages. 22 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYSec. 12, Subd. 7) Public broadcasting HDTV Just over $9 million in the bill would fund public broadcasting efforts. Minnesota's largest public television sta- tion plans to construct a digital broadcaststation in anticipation of shifting industrystandards and the state is going to help footthe bill. SF1905 includes a one-time $750,000 ap- propriation for Twin Cities Public Televi-sion, which runs KTCA (Channel 2) andKTCI (Channel 17), to help pay for the digi-tal transmission facility \"and develop high-definition digital television capability.\" Digital television stations will be able to provide a High-Definition TV signal com-parable in quality to a 35 mm Hollywoodfilm. In place of the HDTV signal, the stationcould choose to broadcast four signals oflesser quality through the same digital cable,allowing for a much broader range of pro-gramming. Twin Cities Public Television plans to build the digital station, at a total cost of $2.25million, and have it on line by August 1998.It would be one of the first such stations inthe world. (Art. 1, Sec. 12, Subd. 8) Ice arenas The bill spends $5 million to build more indoor ice arenas and renovate existing fa-cilities across Minnesota. One million dollars would be for grants of up to $100,000 for rinks in need of repair.The remaining $4 million can be doled inamounts up to $250,000 for new facilities.The Minnesota Amateur Sports Commis-sion administers the program, which wasstarted by the 1995 Legislature and $2.9 mil-lion in funds. (Art. 1, Sec. 26) HEALTH Signed by the governorMeetings via interactive TV A new law signed by the gover- nor will allow official bodies, in-cluding the Legislature, toconduct meetings via interactivetelevision. The technology is like telephone conference calling with the addi- tion of live video. Meeting participants atdifferent places can talk to and hear eachother through television. Legislators have said the measure would enable them to spend more time amongtheir constituency while continuing to con-duct legislative business. The measure alsoapplies to other units of government, such ascounties, cities, and school boards, where it can have an even bigger impact. Under the law, each member of a body participating in the meeting via interactiveTV is considered present and can participatein all proceedings, if an organization's rulesallow it. The bill states that interactive meetings are permissible provided that: all members of the body can hear and seeeach other; members of the public present at the regu-lar meeting location can see and hear alldiscussion and testimony and all votes ofmembers of the body; at least one member of the body is physi-cally present at the regular meeting place;and all required public notice is provided, andincludes information that the meeting willbe conducted via interactive television. The law also allows members of the Rural Finance Agency or the Minnesota HousingFinance Agency to officially meet \u2014 andvote \u2014 by phone. The move will save timeand money given the diverse geographic rep-resentation of those governmental bodies. The measure, effective May 16, 1997, was sponsored by Rep. Loren Solberg (DFL-Bovey) and Sen. Carol Flynn (DFL-Mpls). HF829/SF755*/CH154 More MinnesotaCare enrollees Minnesota hospitals and health care pro- viders would see a tax break and more of thestate's poor would become eligible for state-subsidized health insurance under a billawaiting the governor's signature. The ( HF1441/SF1208* ) would expand the state's MinnesotaCare programand at the same time cut the 2 percent tax onhospitals and health care providers (used tofund MinnesotaCare) to 1.5 percent for twoyears. Whether to continue the tax breakwould be discussed after the two years runout. The Legislature passed a compromise ver- sion of the bill May 19. Rep. Lee Greenfield(DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Linda Berglin (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the bill. Overall, it is expected to cost about $32 million over the next two years to add morepeople to the insurance plan. The tax cutwould save hospitals and health care provid-ers about $54 million over the same timeperiod. Supporters of the measure main-tain the MinnesotaCare account is strong now and can withstand a tax cut. Others,however, wanted a deeper tax cut, down to 1percent. Currently, the 2 percent tax gener-ates about $323.6 million over two years andthat doesn't include separate revenue sourcessuch as premiums and other taxes collected. MinnesotaCare is a state-subsidized in- surance plan created in 1992 to extend healthinsurance coverage to the uninsured. Theprogram serves about 97,000 people whopay premiums based on income and co-payments for some services. Currently, (de-pending on their income), single people,couples without children, and families withchildren younger than 21 are covered. Specifically, the bill would affect single people and couples without children. Itwould increase the annual income limits ofthose two groups to 175 percent of the fed-eral poverty level, or $13,807 for singles and$18,567 for couples without children. Thecurrent income limit is 135 percent of thefederal poverty level, or $10,651 and $14,323,respectively. At the same time MinnesotaCare would welcome more poor people, it also would setan asset limit on new applicants. The pro-gram would be limited to families with lessthan $30,000 in net assets and individualswith less than $15,000 in net assets. The assettest would exclude a home and personalitems and is expected to eliminate some4,000 to 5,000 people from the program. HF1441/SF1208* also includes a prescrip- tion drug program for seniors over age 65who earn less than $9,468 per year (120percent of the federal poverty level). The program would provide coverage, ef- fective Jan. 1, 1999, for prescription drugscurrently covered by Medical Assistance.Participants would be expected to pay anannual $120 premium and satisfy a $300annual deductible. To qualify, a senior citizen also must be enrolled in Medicare and have no insurancecoverage for prescription drugs. Taking into account premiums paid by Minnesota seniors, the new program is ex-pected to cost about $3.7 million over thenext two years. Among other highlights, the bill: Increases the reimbursement rate for den- tists who care for MinnesotaCare patientsby 15 percent. Eliminates the $400 annual surcharge doc- tors pay on their license to practice inMinnesota. Sets aside $7.5 million over the next two years to provide grants and loans to ruralhospitals to make building improvements.May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 23The Department of Health would have the authority to award interest-free grants orloans of up to $1.5 million per hospital. Sets up a maximum $150 million emer- gency reserve fund just in case the federalgovernment decides to cut back on healthcare dollars to the states. The reserve wouldhelp MinnesotaCare cushion the blow. Eliminates certain people currently on Gen- eral Assistance Medical Care, a free state-run health care program, and makes themeligible for MinnesotaCare, where premi-ums are paid based on income. Expands MinnesotaCare coverage to in- clude nonpreventative dental care \u2014 ex-cluding orthodontic services \u2014 for certainadults whose family income is less than 175percent of the poverty level. Currently,these services are covered for children un-der 21 and pregnant women, but adults areonly covered for preventative dental care.A 50 percent co-pay would be required foradults, under the bill. HIGHER EDUCATION Signed by the governorLegislation pending before the governor would make more Minnesotans eligible for MinnesotaCare,the state's subsidized health insurance program, and would save health providers money by cuttingtheir tax from 2 percent to 1.5 percent. The tax revenue funds the MinnesotaCare program. Health care directives A Minnesota driver's license can tell you a lot about a personbesides age, height, and weight.A new state law, effective Jan. 1,1998, will allow for a bit moreinformation to be included onthat small plastic card. Existing law requires a driver's license ap- plication to include space to indicate whethera driver has a living will, a document thatdeclares a person's preferences for medicaltreatment to prolong life under dire circum-stances.A short message to emergency and medi- cal personnel is included on the licenses ofpeople who indicate that they have livingwills. Under the new law, the license application will allow people to indicate if they have a\"living will/health care directive,\" and thechange will be reflected in the message thatappears on licenses. The expanded license designation will serve people who have granted another per-son durable power of attorney for healthcare and people who have other written ad-vance health care directives allowed understate law. (Durable power of attorney for health care is an arrangement by which someone isdesignated to make decisions regardingmedical treatment for you if you are unableto make those decisions yourself.) The legislation was sponsored by Rep. Dave Bishop (R-Rochester) and Sen. Jane Ranum(DFL-Mpls). HF179*/SF178/CH60 Omnibus higher education bill Gov. Arne Carlson signed the $2.3 billion omnibus higher edu-cation finance bill May 20, afterthe House approved the mea-sure May 15 by a vote 118-14. The governor used his line-item veto to remove a $100,000 appro-priation from the bill that would have fundeda loan repayment assistance program forlawyers who provide legal service to under- privileged clients. (See related story. page 39) The law, sponsored in the House by Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL-Winona) and in theSenate by Sen. LeRoy Stumpf (DFL-ThiefRiver Falls), funds the University of Minne-sota, Minnesota State Colleges and Univer-sities (MnSCU), and the Higher EducationServices Office (HESO) through the 1998-99 biennium. The bill also addresses the rising cost of higher education, primarily through tax in-centives. For example, the \"EdVest\" provi-sions in the law allow individuals to set asidemoney, which is tax-exempt, to pay for highereducation. The legislation also imposes a number of technical changes to the state's higher edu-cational systems. HESO and MnSCU The state will spend more than $2.3 billion on higher education through the 1998-99biennium. (Art. 1, Sec. 1) The Higher Education Services Office, which distributes financial aid to Minnesotastudents, will receive $277.6 million for thetwo-year period to fund a variety of initia-tives, including: $19 million for a state work-study pro- gram; $12 million for an on-line library catalog; more than $10 million for the Learning Network of Minnesota, a distance-learn-ing program; and $250,000 to provide grants to students of color enrolled in nursing programs. (Art.1, Sec. 2) MnSCU will receive a state appropriation for the biennium of more than $1 billion,with each campus' share of the fund deter-mined by a formula that maintains the 1997allocations, adjusted for enrollment, and addsa share of the new dollars. According to the law, the funding must be used for improvement of programs, libraryacquisitions and student services, while hold-ing down tuition increases. (Art. 1, Sec. 3) University of Minnesota The University of Minnesota will receive a $1.1 billion appropriation, with the vastmajority of the money allocated to instruc-tional expenditures. The non-instructional expenditures in- clude, along with a number of other projects,an unspecified amount for a career and edu-cation planning system, $3 million for amulti-sheet ice and tennis facility, and morethan $100 million for agricultural and exten-sion services. (Art. 1, Sec. 4) Signed by the governor24 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYIn addition, the Legislature requires the university to report back on a variety ofefforts. Specifically, the university must pre-pare an annual statement on its programsfor female athletes and its Title IX compli-ance status (Art. 1, Sec. 4). Moreover, theschool will have to address the problemsassociated with transferring credits from thestate college system, and provide a detailedreport on current and planned informationtechnology expenditures. (Art. 1, Sec. 6) College affordability The law also contains several initiatives aimed at helping families and individualspay for higher education. Under the law, Minnesota will offer \"Go- pher State Bonds.\" A portion of the statebonds sold to pay for the construction ofnew state facilities will be marketed in smalldenominations, similar to U.S. SavingsBonds, and the first $25,000 in bonds held byan individual are exempt from consider-ation in determining a student's financialaid eligibility. The first $25,000 of a family'ssavings or other assets is also exempt fromthe financial aid calculations. The \"EdVest\" initiative contained in the law is meant to encourage families or indi-viduals to set aside money for higher educa-tion by providing new tax incentives. Individuals can contribute to a state-man- aged account, and the interest earned is tax-exempt, until withdrawal. When the moneyfinally is withdrawn it will then be taxed tothe student, not the parent, effectively low-ering the tax obligation. The state will also make matching grants,up to a $300 annual maximum. Families earning under $50,000 per year can receive a15 percent in-kind contribution from thestate, while those with annual incomes be-tween $50,000 and $80,000 can get a 5 per-cent bonus. The law also specifies penaltiesfor early withdrawal and for spending themoney on something other than educationexpenses. (Art. 2, Secs. 12-16) Keeping technologically fit The law enacts a number of technology initiatives, including $12 million for theMinnesota Library Information Network,or MNLink, which Pelowski has called \"themother of all on-line services for libraryaccess.\" It provides Internet linkage amongpublic libraries, school and private libraries,and U of M and MnSCU libraries. The highereducation institutions will provide staff andtechnical support. (Art. 1, Sec. 2, Subd. 8) The law also appropriates money to de- velop courses that could be delivered throughthe Virtual University. The program is acollaboration between the U of M, MnSCU,and private colleges that enables students toregister for classes via the Internet at almostevery college and university in the state. \"This would serve as a gateway leading to all higher education existing in Minnesota,\"Pelowski explained at an earlier meeting.\"It's the first time the three entities haveworked together to enhance higher educa-tion in the state.\" The plan is based on the World Wide Web page currently used by the University ofMinnesota. According to information fromJohn Gunyou of the Minnesota Office of The $2.3 billion omnibus higher education finance bill holds $1.1 billion for the University ofMinnesota, including $3 million for a multi-sheet ice and tennis facility, and more than $100 millionfor agricultural and extension services.Technology, the plan is meant to improveaccess to course offerings, expand choices indegree programs, allow for the transfer ofcredits between schools, and increase off-campus learning opportunities. The law funds research for finding ways to add course work to the program. Also funded is the Minnesota Career and Education Planning System, a program to al-low K-12 and college students to access careerinformation that would help them devise edu-cational plans. (Art. 1, Sec. 3, Subd. 3) Another $1.5 million, matched by the U of M or private sources, will fund a U of MInternet initiative for research and develop-ment of telecommunications networks. (Art.1, Sec. 2, Subd. 6) HF2136/SF1888*/CH183 HOUSING Protecting tenants A new law prohibits landlords from penalizing tenants for call-ing 911 for emergency assistance. The law responds to a problem that developed after some citiespassed anti-crime ordinances that penalize landlords whose properties aresubject to frequent police visits. As a result,some landlords began warning tenantsagainst calling police, often with the threat ofeviction. Many targets of the warnings havebeen women who suffer domestic abuse. Effective July 1, 1997, a landlord may not impose a penalty on a tenant for calling 911in response to domestic abuse or any othersituation, and any lease provisions that woulddo so could not be enforced. The law supersedes any local regulations and authorizes the attorney general's officeto investigate and prosecute violations. Itwould slap landlords with civil penalties foractual damages or $250, whichever is greater,and would award them to tenants, in addi-tion to any attorneys' fees incurred to obtainthem. The law clarifies that tenants are not ex- empt from any penalties resulting from leasebreaches or disruptive behavior. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Michael Paymar (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen.Dave Johnson (DFL-Bloomington).

Beginning January 1998, Minnesotans on welfaremust work or lose a chunk oftheir monthly public assistancecheck. After months of debate, Gov. Arne Carlson April 30 signed Minnesota'snew welfare law, a response to a 1996 federalact that scrapped the long-standing welfaresystem and required states to move welfarerecipients to work or face millions of dollarsin federal penalties. Minnesota's passage of the law meets the deadline ( July 1, 1997)imposed by the federal govern-ment requiring all states to reportjust how they plan to move fami-lies on welfare to work. Both bodies of the Minnesota Legislature passed a compromiseversion of the bill April 28. TheHouse voted 120-14 and the Sen-ate voted 67-0. While much of Minnesota's new law focuses on moving wel-fare families to work, there is asecond theme \u2014 softening someof the cuts found in the federallaw aimed at immigrants. Underthe federal law, legal immigrantswill lose all public assistance ben-efits, including food stamps, ef-fective this summer. Minnesota's welfare law (HF159/SF1*/CH85 ) will use state dollars to replace some ofthe cuts, but will leave most im-migrants hundreds of dollarsshort each month compared toprevious federal benefits. Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL- Mpls) and Sen. Don Samuelson(DFL-Brainerd) sponsored thebill. Below is a summary of some of the new law's highlights. Immigrants Although the federal law has left legal immigrants with little,some in Minnesota will be eli-gible for about $290 a month incash assistance \u2014 $203 per month as part ofGeneral Assistance (GA) and $87 per monthto replace lost food stamps. GA is a state program that offers help to those in poverty who do not qualify for otherstate or federal welfare programs. However, only those legal immigrants living in Minne-sota by March 1, 1997, will qualify for GA.Those who become elderly or disabled whileliving here also could receive GA. (Art. 3,Sec. 34) It is important to note that the $87 a month to replace lost food stamps is tempo-rary. It is only offered from July 1, 1997, toJune 30, 1998. (Art. 3, Sec. 42) In Minnesota,an estimated 16,000 legal immigrants willlose their federal food stamps in 1997. Another 5,400 elderly and disabled immi- grants are expected to lose their federalSupplemental Security Income (SSI) laterthis summer. SSI began in 1974 and providesabout $400 per month to the needy who are aged, blind, or disabled. The state's offer of GA will help to replace that income. In addition to GA, the new law keeps cer- tain legal immigrants eligible for Minnesota'swelfare programs, from Medical Assistance(a joint state-federal program for those who can't afford health care) to the state's newwelfare-to-work program known as the Min-nesota Family Investment Program (MFIP).(Art. 1, Sec. 7 and Art. 3, Sec. 19) The measure, however, requires that the income of a legal immigrant's Americansponsor be considered when determiningeligibility for public assistance. This is inkeeping with the federal law. Work for welfare For several years, Minnesota has experi- mented with a welfare pilot program in eightcounties that requires poor families withchildren to work for public assistance. Under the new law, that experiment will become permanent beginningJan. 1, 1998, and cover all 87 Min-nesota counties. (Art. 1, Sec. 1) The Minnesota Family Invest- ment Program, or MFIP as it iscalled, allows families to acceptlower-paying jobs while receiv-ing some public assistance suchas extra monthly cash and subsi-dized child and health care. Intheory, allowing someone to workwhile still receiving benefits helpsa low-skilled parent gain workexperience and eventually obtaina better job. MFIP replaces the traditional Aid to Families with DependentChildren (AFDC) program doneaway with by the 1996 federalwelfare law. And, in keeping withfederal law, Minnesota's law setsa five-year, lifetime limit on re-ceiving MFIP welfare checks. (Art.1, Sec. 32) There are some exceptions to the five-year limit, including vic-tims of domestic abuse who needtime to find safety before they cansettle into a job. (Art. 1, Sec. 32,Subd. 4) Under MFIP, a parent or guard- ian is required to develop a jobsearch and employment plan andaccept any suitable job oncethey've completed all the steps intheir plan. As is the case now, thestate will continue to pay foremployment and job training ser-vices. In a two-parent family, at least one parent must find work right away. Singleparent families have up to six months to findwork. (Art. 1, Sec. 40) Minnesota's new welfare law will require poor families with children towork for their welfare check. It will replace the traditional Aid to Familieswith Dependent Children (AFDC) program. And, in keeping with federallaw, Minnesota sets a five-year, lifetime limit on receiving welfare checks.26 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYIncome limits The new law does set income limits on how much a family can earn on the job andstill continue to receive a monthly MFIPcheck. For a family of three, a limit of $1,311 per month is set. A family of three in the currentpilot MFIP program, can earn up to $1,554per month before being cut off. Officialsmaintain the state couldn't afford the higheramount and still take the program statewide.(Art. 1, Sec. 13) Penalties for no work Families who refuse to work or otherwise break the rules will see their grant cut by 10percent for a least a month and until theviolation is corrected. For subsequent occurrences, a county will directly pay a family's rent, and possiblyutilities, out of a grant and cut the remainderby 30 percent before forwarding it to thefamily. (Art. 1, Sec. 36, Subd. 1) Education limits The law also limits the amount of postsecondary education a person may re-ceive while on MFIP. Under the currentAFDC program, some parents are allowed toattend college for four years while still re-ceiving their monthly welfare check, childcare, and health care services. Generally, the measure limits approved postsecondary or training programs to a yearor less but does allow for up to two years if thediploma or degree can be shown to help thewelfare parent earn a better income. He orshe must agree to pay back the cost of thesecond year when they earn 150 percent ofthe federal poverty level, which is now $11,835per year. (Art. 1, Sec. 44, Subd. 1 and 4) New mom exemption Although most welfare recipients would be required to work, the law does allow forcertain exemptions, such as a parent whostays home to care for a child under the ageof one. In two-parent households, only oneparent could claim the exemption, and thenonly once in a lifetime. (Art. 1, Sec. 47) Residency requirement The law mandates a 30-day residency re- quirement to receive welfare and requiresthat, for the first year, families who move toMinnesota receive either the benefit amountthey would have received in their previousstate, or Minnesota's rate, whichever is less.(Art. 1, Sec. 8, Subd. 1a and 3; and Art. 3, Sec.27)Penalties split The federal welfare law puts a great deal of pressure on states to move people off thewelfare rolls or lose money. It is unclear,however, if the state plans to share that pres-sure with counties, which operate most wel-fare programs. Beginning with fiscal year 1997, each state must show that 25 percent of its families onwelfare are working at least 20 hours perweek. By fiscal year 2002, that jumps to 50percent working at least 30 hours per week.There are cash penalties for states that do notmeet the percentages. At one point a legislative proposal would have forced counties to share in the federalpenalty. But the new law takes a softer ap-proach. Instead, it requires the Departmentof Human Services and counties to worktogether to develop a plan on how to pay afederal penalty. They must report their con-clusions to the Legislature by Oct. 1, 1998.(Art. 1, Sec. 63) Drug offenses Anyone convicted of a felony drug offense after July 1, 1997, will be barred from partici-pating in MFIP until they complete theirsentence. When and if they qualify for amonthly check, the law requires counties topay rent and utilities first before mailing outthe balance. Random drug testing also isrequired. (Art. 1, Sec. 16, Subd. 1) Those convicted of a drug felony after July 1, 1997, would be barred from receiving$203 per month under GA for five years afterthey completed their sentence. That is, un- less the person is in treatment or on a waitinglist for treatment. (Art. 3, Sec. 28) Parole violators and felons on the run would face a lifetime ban for both MFIP andGA. (Art. 1, Sec. 16, Subd. 2 and 3; and Art.3, Sec. 28, Subd. 2) Those convicted offraudulently attempting to receive benefitsin two or more states at one time will bebarred from both MFIP and GA for 10 years.(Art. 1, Sec. 16, Subd. 4 and Art. 3, Sec. 28,Subd. 4) HF159/SF1*/CH85 Minnesota's new welfare law softens some ofthe cuts found in the federal law aimed atimmigrants. Under the federal law, legalimmigrants will lose all public assistance benefits,including food stamps, effective this summer.Governor receives omnibus bill Same sex marriages would be prohibited, drug addicts could buy clean needles at theirlocal pharmacy, and state hospital patientsburied years ago in unmarked graves wouldbe recognized, under the omnibus healthand human services finance bill now await-ing the governor's signature.

A large chunk of the bill's price tag \u2014 $1.8 billion \u2014 would cover the health care needsof poor Minnesotans under two separateprograms: Medical Assistance and GeneralAssistance Medical Care. Another $2.7 billion would pay for certain nursing home, disability, mental health,group housing, chemical dependency, andother long-term care services. About $507 million would fund the state's welfare programs, which were overhauledthis session after the federal governmentscrapped the old system, cut benefits to legalimmigrants, and required welfare recipientsto work. Rep. Lee Greenfield (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Don Samuelson (DFL-Brainerd) sponsoredSF1908* . The Legislature passed the bill May 16. The House voted 112-19 and the Senatevoted 54-12. Below are some of the highlights in the bill. Same-sex marriages The bill prohibits marriages between people of the same gender and prohibits therecognition of such marriages in Minnesotaeven if the union occurred in a state thatsanctions such marriages. The proposal began as an attempt to re- spond to the possibility that Hawaii mayrecognize same-sex marriages and preparefor people who might move to Minnesotafrom that state. Hawaii passed a law prohib-May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 27INDUSTRYiting same sex marriages, but a lower court ruled the law unconstitutional. The state hasappealed to its state Supreme Court. (Art.10) Clean needles To help prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS among drug addicts, the bill wouldallow pharmacies to sell, without prescrip-tion, new hypodermic needles and syringes.They could be sold only from behind thecounter and could not be readily availableon store shelves. (Art. 2, Sec. 17, Subd. 2) Naming the dead The bill would spend $200,000 to replace the unmarked or numbered graves of thou-sands of mentally retarded people who dieddecades ago while patients in Minnesota'sstate hospitals. The state dollars, however,would be withheld until private money raisedto replace the grave sites has been exhausted.(Art. 1, Sec. 2, Subd. 7) Child care licensing With the federal welfare changes requir- ing parents on public assistance to work ifthey want a monthly helping hand, officialsanticipate a huge increase in the demand forchild care. The bill sets aside $200,000 to addtwo more fire marshal positions to the De-partment of Human Services' licensing divi-sion to speed up the licensing of child careprograms. A separate House bill deals withmany other licensing requirements for childcare programs. (Art. 1, Sec. 2, Subd. 2) Assistance dogs Minnesota nonprofit groups that train dogs to help people with disabilities wouldreceive $50,000 over the 1998-1999 two-year state budgeting period. The dogs areoften rescued from animal shelters and helptheir owners lead independent lives at homeand at work. (Art. 1, Sec. 2, Subd. 8) Living at home nursing The bill spends an additional $650,000 to expand from 15 to 27 the number of living-at-home/block nurse programs. These com-munity-based programs, which are locatedthroughout the state, enable seniors to liveindependently in their homes. To avoid nurs-ing homes, the programs provide nurse homevisits and coordinate health and personalcare services on a sliding fee basis. They alsoprovide homemaking services, counseling,and health training for both the elderly per-son and his or her family. (Art. 1, Sec. 2,Subd. 8)Teen gambling Lottery money in the amount of $250,000 over the biennium would fund a compulsivegambling prevention and education projectfor adolescents in St. Louis County. (Art. 1,Sec. 2, Subd. 8) Public housing seniors To help keep folks out of nursing homes, the bill sets aside $75,000 to help frail seniorand disabled citizens living in public hous-ing \u2014 especially those with language andcultural barriers \u2014 hook up with commu-nity support services and remain in theirhomes. (Art. 1, Sec. 2, Subd. 9) Women's mental health crisis center Hennepin County would become home to a one-year experimental community-based crisis center for women who are expe-riencing a mental health crisis resulting fromchildhood physical or sexual abuse. The billspends $200,000 in fiscal year 1998 and in-structs the county to contract with a four-bed adult foster care facility. (Art. 1, Sec. 2,Subd. 9) Women, Infants and Children To make up for recent federal cuts to the Women, Infants and Children nutritionalprogram, the bill spends $650,000 in 1998 tomaintain the current caseload level of about95,500 monthly cases. Otherwise, some 1,900women and children would have been cutoff. In addition to the $650,000, the billappropriates another $1.5 million to the pro-gram which provides supplemental food,nutritional counseling, and health screen-ings for low-income, high-risk pregnant,breast feeding, and postpartum women, in-fants, and children under the age of 5. (Art.1, Sec. 3, Subd. 2) Father adoption registry The bill appropriates $286,000 over the 1998-1999 budgeting period to pay for theDepartment of Health to register the namesof fathers \u2014 or potential fathers \u2014 with thestate. A separate bill ( HF296/SF203* ) carries the specifics of the registry, where men whowant to be a part of their children's lives canbe assured of notification if their child is putup for adoption. The registry is a way toprotect a birth father's rights in the event hischild is put up for adoption, and to protectchildren from having adoptions unduly dis-rupted.Alternative medicine study The Department of Health would receive $20,000 to study the scope of complemen-tary or alternative medicine in Minnesotaand whether it is covered by health insur-ance. Also, the study is expected to recom-mend whether Minnesota should license orregulate alternative medicine providers. (Art.1, Sec. 3, Subd. 2) Underground communication Beneath public streets run countless miles of lines andcables, all carrying services forwater, electricity, sewer, naturalgas, telephones, and cable televi-sion. The underground has become even busier in recent years with the advent of new tech-nologies and new uses for the technology,such as those for telephones. The result?Increased demand for limited space. A new law will regulate the rights-of-way to the underground for telecommunicationsand related companies. Proponents have saidit successfully balances public and commer-cial interests. Under the law, most of which became effective May 10, 1997, towns and cities willmanage underground access by requiring:registration and permits; plans for construc-tion; construction performance bonds andinsurance coverage; and project data reports.They also can establish: standards; location and facilities; coordinationand timing requirements; and removal re-quirements for abandoned equipment. Cities may recover \"actual costs\" from the companies for providing administrative ser-vices, such as processing applications, con-ducting inspections, and issuing permits,but may not charge more. Currently, citiescan charge only $25 in fees. The telecommu-nications companies remain fully respon-sible for returning road or other surfaces totheir previous condition. Cities must treat companies equally and may not deny underground access exceptwhen necessary for health or safety reasons,or in the event of a substantial breach of theterms and conditions of access (or severalother related conditions). In the event of a dispute, the law requires a review by the authorized unit of govern-ment, which would have to submit a reportin support of its decision. A company thenSigned by the governor28 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYcould ask to have the matter settled through arbitration, paid for equally by both parties. Finally, the law directs the Public Utilities Commission to develop a set of statewidestandards to govern use of the right-of-way.The rules will apply to construction stan-dards, maintenance, and repair. A report tothe Legislature is due by November 1997. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris) and Sen. Steve Novak(DFL-New Brighton). HF322/SF442*/CH123 INSURANCELABOR Preventing rate hikes A new state law effective April 29 will prevent insurance ratehikes for people who are passen-gers on city buses involved intraffic accidents. Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) spon-sored the measure in the Legislature. The impetus for the legislation came from an 86-year-old resident of Farrell's legisla-tive district in St. Paul. The woman was injured in January 1997 after she boarded a city bus. As the womanwalked toward an open seat, the bus slammedto a stop to avoid a collision. The sudden stop sent the woman toppling backwards, bouncing off the windshield, andlanding at the bottom of the steps inside thebus door. She spent five days in the hospitalwith a variety of injuries and has since en-dured weeks of physical therapy. The woman had to absorb another blow when informed that the bus company wouldnot pay for any of her medical expenses.That, she was told, was the responsibility ofher own insurance company. The state's no-fault insurance law requires that the woman's coverage come under herown automobile insurance policy. The new state law provides a remedy for people in such a situation without taking onthe highly controversial area of no-fault law. The law prohibits insurance companies from increasing a policyholder's premium ifthe person is involved in an accident while apassenger in a bus, taxi, or commuter van. According to Farrell, his constituent did not see an increase in auto insurance ratesafter the incident on the city bus, but the lawwill prevent anyone else in similar circum-stances from seeing a rate hike. HF1045*/SF759/CH64Direct OB/GYN access A new state law will forbid health insurers from requiring women toreceive a referral in order to see an obstetri-cian or a gynecologist. The law, effective Jan. 1, 1998, will require that insurance com-panies and health maintenanceorganizations allow female en-rollees direct access to obstetri-cians and gynecologists. Under the law, women will be allowed to schedule an appointmentwith either health professional without priorapproval from the insurer or a referral froma \"gatekeeper\" primary care physician. The law will require direct access for an- nual examinations, any subsequent treat-ment deemed necessary by the specialist,maternity care, and treatment of acute oremergency conditions. Health plans also will be barred from charging women extra for direct access. The legislation was sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown) and Sen.Deanna Wiener (DFL-Eagan). HF447*/SF398/CH26 Managing diabetes Health plans will be required to provide coverage for training andeducation to assist diabetics inmanaging their disease, under anew state law effective Aug. 1. The law will expand a 1994 law requiring medical insurance companies andhealth maintenance organizations to pro-vide coverage for syringes, blood-testingdevices, and other equipment diabetics need. The law is to ensure that diabetics are properly trained to use the medical equip-ment and to monitor their own condition.The law also will require medical nutritiontherapy to be included in health coverage. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Tom Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul) and Sen. SteveNovak (DFL-New Brighton).

Strawberry workers, repre- sented by the United Farm Work- ers Union, are conducting a nationalcampaign to call attention to their plight.The typical strawberry worker earns about$8,500 per season for working as many as 12hours a day. Despite record production levels and sales revenue of $650 million per year in the straw-berry industry, most workers have not had asignificant raise in 10 years. According to the resolution, workers also claim a variety of workplace abuses includ-ing: demand for sexual favors in exchangefor employment; hiring and firing on whim;lack of fresh water and clean toilet facilities;and lack of health care in an occupation thatexposes them to hazardous pesticides andchronic back injuries. Strawberry workers who have struggled to change these practices and organize a unionhave faced firing and blacklisting. Workerswho have voted for union representationhave seen the fields they work plowed under. The resolution, which will be transmitted to President Bill Clinton and to the governorof California, puts the state on record alongwith a number of other states, consumergroups, environmental organizations,churches, labor organizations, and others insupport of the strawberry workers cause.

HF1877/SF1675*/Res. 3 Human rights loopholes Effective Aug. 1, 1997, a new law will add \"individuals\" to thelist of those prohibited fromengaging in acts of reprisalagainst someone who files adiscrimination complaint. Under current law, individuals are pro- hibited from engaging in reprisals only ifthey are employees. If they quit or are fired,they are free to perpetrate reprisals againstthose who complained against them. In testimony before the House Labor- Management Relations Committee earlierIf you will be visiting the Capitol in the near future, call the Capitol Historic Site Program at (612) 296-2881 to schedule a tour.Signed by the governorMay 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 29LAWthis year, Ken Nicolai of the Department of Human Services explained the problem. \"Astudent attending one of Minnesota's col-leges . . . filed a sexual harassment complaintagainst a professor who was subsequentlyfired by the college. He then took severalactions against her, including filing a law-suit. We found it constituted reprisal, butthat we had no jurisdiction over such indi-viduals.\" The bill was sponsored by Rep. Luanne Koskinen (DFL-Coon Rapids) in the Houseand by Sen. David L. Knutson (R-Burnsville)in the Senate. HF814/SF323*/CH171 Omnibus data practices bill On May 19, the House passed the omni- bus data practices conference committeereport. The vote was 84-49. New language added by conferees would enable juvenile justice officers to obtain in-formation about students from schools. Thatinformation would include the student'sname, address, telephone number, birth date,school schedule, attendance record, photo-graphs, and parents' names, addresses, andtelephone numbers. (Sec. 3, Subd. 8) Under another provision added in confer- ence committee, homeowners in Washing-ton and Ramsey counties would have to beasked before a governmental agency couldsell their names to commercial interests.Property owners could request that theirnames and addresses be excluded. (Sec. 29) This year's omnibus bill ( HF1460*/ SF1277 ) primarily affects three areas of law: access to and dissemination of records bylaw enforcement agencies, the treatment ofstudent records, and the treatment of juve-nile offender records. HF1460*/SF1277 was sponsored in the House by Rep. Mary Jo McGuire (DFL-Fal-con Heights), chair of the JudiciaryCommittee's Data Practices Subcommittee,and in the Senate by Sen. Don Betzold (DFL-Fridley). It now awaits the governor'sapproval. Access by law enforcement The bill would make it easier for law en- forcement agencies to collect data on fugi-tives from the law if a fugitive happens to becollecting welfare benefits. The bill says that certain welfare and hous- ing data may be disclosed to law enforce-ment officers regarding felons who are flee- ing to avoid prosecution, custody or con-finement, or are violating a condition ofprobation or parole. (Sec. 5, Subd. 2) The bill also requires that the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA), in conjunc-tion with a criminal and juvenile justice in-formation policy group, report to theLegislature with a plan to make convictionrecords data available at locations beyond theBCA's central office. The report is due inJanuary 1998. (The original House bill wouldhave required the BCA to put certain crimi-nal history data on the Internet, including aconvicted criminal's identity and offenserecord, which already are considered public.)The BCA is currently required to provide thatinformation at no charge through a com-puter monitor at its central office. (Sec. 52) Student health records Current law requires elementary and sec- ondary schools to maintain student healthrecords \u2014 mostly immunizations \u2014 for-ever. The bill would make schools keep thoserecords until a student turns 23. (Sec. 5,Subd. 2) The bill also would loosen provisions re- garding required tetanus and diphtheria(DPT) immunizations. A student who hasreceived three doses, with the last receivedbetween the ages of 6 and 11, is not requiredto have additional immunizations for an-other 10 years. The law currently requiresthat students in older grades must have hadan immunization at 11 years of age or older.(Sec. 23, Subd. 10) A third provision regarding student records would make it clear that school dis-tricts or school boards have the authority toenforce immunization requirements. Cur-rent law specifies that students must submitthose records within 30 days after enrollingin a new school, but does not say who hasenforcement authority. The bill also wouldexempt crisis nurseries from the immuniza-tion requirements for up to five consecutivedays of attendance. (Sec. 21, Subd. 5) Juvenile records The bill would help the BCA collect some information on juveniles and authorize theagency to disclose other information. The computerized information the bureau currently keeps on juvenile criminalhistories is considered private. Some of itcan, however, be disclosed to other law en-forcement agencies and the court system.Under the bill, that information also couldbe disclosed to agencies in other states. Italso would clarify that the informationreleased for background checks must per- tain to the juvenile's adjudication \u2014 or court\u2014 history. (Sec. 47, Subd. 1) The bill also would require the BCA to keep juvenile records \"for the longest timeperiod applicable to any item in the indi-vidual juvenile history record.\" That couldmean permanently if the juvenile goes on tocommit crimes as an adult. Conversely, the bill would require that the records be disposed of quickly should thecharges fail to stick. The bill provides that inthe case of a dismissal of charges, the recordswould be immediately destroyed. If the juve-nile is not referred to a diversion program orno petition has been filed within six monthsafter the arrest, the files must be destroyed. If the juvenile is referred to a diversion program \u2014 an alternative to jail, after whichthe record is cleared \u2014 the files are de-stroyed after he or she reaches age 21. If thejuvenile is found guilty of a gross misde-meanor or felony, the files are maintaineduntil the juvenile reaches age 28. The bill saysthat an agency that receives juvenile datafrom the BCA must destroy it according tothe same schedule. (Sec. 47, Subd. 2) Other juvenile data provisions would re- quire other law enforcement agencies to pro-vide the BCA with records on juveniles whocommit gross misdemeanors or felonies.Targeted misdemeanors include DWI andorder for protection violations; privacy; restraining order violations; andindecent exposure. (Sec. 48, Subd. 1) The bill also would require the BCA to give any other relevant information \u2014 notnecessarily included in the official juvenilerecords \u2014 to police departments to help ininvestigations. (Sec. 49) Finally, the bill would provide the public defender's office with electronic access topublic criminal and juvenile justice data.(Sec. 51) Other provisions The bill also would allow some health care professionals to use addresses other thantheir home address for public purposes.Advocates for the provision say it is neces-sary for security reasons. (Sec. 4, Subd. 2) Other bill provisions deal with tax law. For instance, the Internal Revenue Service(IRS) could disclose to the state lottery theamount of a winner's delinquent state taxesif the individual won $600 or more. Cur-rently, the IRS is not notified unless some-one wins at least $1,000. (Sec. 41, Subd. 7)30 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYChilling public participation The House passed a bill May 16 that would protect citizens from lawsuits intended tokeep them from exercising their free speechrights. The vote was 124-7. They're called SLAPP suits, for strategic litigation against public participation. A fewyears ago, it came to the attention of courtsand lawmakers that some parties \u2014 usuallycommercial interests \u2014 were using the courtsto effectively deny others \u2014 usually privatecitizens or citizen groups \u2014 their right tofree speech. In such a scenario, a developer proposing to build a garbage dump encounters protestsfrom local citizens. He sues them, possiblyfor defamation. The suit will very likely fail in court, but bill supporters say the threat of the lawsuitcan have a chilling effect on public participa-tion. In 1994, the Legislature passed a law to protect against SLAPP suits, requiring de-velopers or others filing the legal action toprove that they had been harmed by theperson or people whose words or actionswere at issue. If developers could not, such alawsuit was to be dismissed. But some have avoided the law by suing in federal rather than state court. HF642/SF848* addresses that problem by allowing an action for damages and attorneyfees in state court against someone who suesan individual in federal court in a SLAPPsuit. The bill says: \"If the person demonstrates that the respondent's action in federal courtwas brought for the purpose of harassment,to inhibit the person's public participation,to interfere with the . addition to attorney'sfees. HF642/SF848* , sponsored in the House by Rep. Wes Skoglund (DFL-Mpls), haspassed the Senate and now heads to thegovernor's desk. Inmate lawsuits A new law will clarify when a prisoner may appeal a ruling thata lawsuit was frivolous or mali-cious. Some prisoners, after having a lawsuit thrown out in court, have attempted to have the case \"retried\" throughcorrections department processes, accord-ing to Rep. Tom Pugh (DFL-South St. Paul),the bill's House sponsor. Effective Aug. 1,the new law states that inmates do not have Minnesota law-enforcement officers whohave died in the line of duty were honoredat a candlelight service on the State Capitolgrounds May 15. Dakota County DeputySheriff Barak Bjorge and his son, William, 3,remember Bjorge's co-worker, Luther Klug,who was killed last July.LOCAL GOVERNMENT Signed by the governorOfficer memoriala right to an additional hearing within thecorrectional facility's disciplinary systemregarding such a finding, and that the cor-rections department must uphold the court'sruling. Existing law provides penalties for filing the suits. Once the court has judged that aninmate's suit lacks merit, corrections offi-cials may determine and impose a penalty,which may mean the loss of privileges, segre-gation, loss of credit for good behavior, oradditional confinement.The bill states thatthe officials must limit punishment to thatspecified in the law and are \"limited to thenature and extent of the infraction penalty tobe imposed.\" The law's Senate sponsor is Sen. Jane Krentz (DFL-May Township). HF909/SF305*/CH33 Saving Roseville tax dollars A new law will save the city of Roseville some of its citizens'hard-earned tax dollars. It wassigned by Gov. Arne CarlsonApril 23. For a variety of reasons, cities, townships, and counties must publish legalnotices in local newspapers. The advertise-ments serve as public notice for land sales, MILITARYSigned by the governorclass action lawsuits, and other governmentactions. Under current law, local governments can publish such notices only in newspaperswhose primary offices are within their juris-diction. But that limitation can cost local govern- ments more than necessary when nearbynewspapers charge substantially less for adspace. Sponsored in the House by Rep. Mindy Greiling (DFL-Roseville), the law will allowthe city of Roseville and Independent SchoolDistrict No. 623 to officially designate anynewspaper with at least 25 percent of itscirculation within the Roseville city limits orwithin the boundaries of the school district. A letter from the Roseville City Council to the House Local Government and Metro-politan Affairs Committee detailed the prob-lem that city has faced. \"The council designated the Roseville Re- view as the official newspaper for 1996, based on substantially lower cost.\" But the letter ofthe law required the city to select the Roseville Focus, based on the paper's office location. The restriction caused Roseville to pay ap-proximately 75 percent more, an additional$4,500, for legal notices in 1996. Originally, the proposal was drafted to save all local governments in Minnesotamoney in publishing legal notices. It wasrestricted to the city of Roseville by an amend-ment in the Senate. According to Greiling, the Minnesota Newspaper Association feared that the lawmight be used by some local officials toretaliate against newspapers that disagreedwith their governmental actions. Another Senate amendment protects lo- cal officials if errors occur in the publicationof public notices. The law takes effect upon approval of the Roseville City Council. Sen. John Marty (DFL-Roseville) spon- sored the bill in the Senate. HF356*/SF284/CH56 Enlist and enroll A new law effective Aug. 1, 1997, will increase the maximum amount of a Minne-sota National Guard member's educationalgrant. Under the law, sponsored in the House by Rep. Loren Jennings (DFL-Harris), up to 50percent of tuition and textbook costs at anyMinnesota public institution of higherMay 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 31OUTSTATEeducation will be covered. For programs outside of Minnesota, the grants would payfor the equivalent of half the cost of a com-parable program at the University of Minne-sota. Currently, the tuition grant program cov- ers the equivalent of up to 75 percent of thecost of undergraduate programs at the Uni-versity of Minnesota or the same amount atanother school. But because graduate pro-grams often cost considerably more, theguard was having trouble enrolling mem-bers in programs such as medical school.Proponents have said that the change is nec-essary to keep the guard attractive to poten-tial recruits. The national guard can target specific pro- grams and students for grant aid. The changewill not cost the guard any additional funds. Sen. Dean Johnson (R-Willmar) spon- sored the Senate proposal. HF397/SF4*/CH160 Flood aid A new state law, effective May 7, 1997, provides $21 million inrelief for victims of the floodingthroughout Minnesota, but mostlawmakers agree the state even-tually will have to do more. The law will draw funds from the state's $522 million budget reserve for flood reliefand will temporarily lift some bureaucraticregulations to ease relief efforts. Gov. ArneCarlson signed the measure May 6. Under the law, $20 million goes to the Department of Public Safety for distributionto counties, cities, and towns affected by theflood. The money can be used for costs asso-ciated with flooding, including their use asmatching funds to receive federal emergencyrelief aid. Another $1 million is earmarked to help state agencies deal with expenses related toflood relief efforts. A variety of state agency rules and fees will be waived to speed flood relief efforts. The bill alsowill provide an adjustment in state aid to helpschool districts affected by the flood. It's still unclear what the total price tag will be to clean up and repair the manyhomes, businesses, and schools damaged bythe disastrous flooding this spring along theMinnesota and Red rivers. Rep. Doug Peterson (DFL-Madison) and Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe (DFL-Erskine) sponsored the $21 million floodrelief measure in the Legislature. HF2129/SF1894*/CH105 SPORTS Signed by the governorA new state law provides $21 million in relief for victims of Minnesota's spring floods, but the losscolumn is still being calculated and lawmakers agree the state eventually will have to do more. Snowmobile safety Lawmakers approved several new snow- mobile safety measures after a winter seasonthat brought a startling death toll from snow-mobile accidents. Bills awaiting Gov. Arne Carlson's signa- ture aim to expand safety trainingrequirements, laws, and crack down ondrunken snowmobilers. Thirty-two peoplewere killed in snowmobile accidents, themost since 1972. Earlier this month, the House approved a bill ( HF551/SF94* ) that provided a neatly packaged formula for snowmobile safetychanges, but the bill was not taken up in theSenate. However, many of the bill's provisions were included in other larger bills and werepassed. Omnibus measures related to game and fish ( all include snowmobile safety pro- visions. All three have been sent to the gov-ernor and await his signature or veto. Two controversial snowmobile safety pro- posals debated this session did not make thecut. The snowmobile safety bill earlier ap- proved by the House included provisionsthat would have required snowmobile own-ers to buy liability insurance and reduced thenighttime speed limit for snowmobiles. Butneither of the provisions was attached toanother legislative vehicle. Under the environment finance bill, the snowmobile registration fee would be in-creased by $15, pushing the total charge to $45 for three years. Increased revenue gener-ated by the fee increases will help pay forimprovements to an overburdened and out-of-date trail system. The bill also would require out-of-state snowmobilers to pay $15 for a permit tooperate their machines on state trails or grant-in-aid trails maintained by local clubs. A total of $800,000 would be provided during the 1998-99 biennium for grants toassist local law enforcement agencies imple-ment new snowmobile enforcement efforts,under the bill. The bill also would expand snowmobile safety training requirements to include allsnowmobile operators 25 and under by 2002. Safety training also would be required of any operator convicted of careless or reck-less operation of a snowmobile and thosewho violate snowmobile speed limits twicewithin one season. The game and fish bill would require that snowmobiles be registered in the legal nameof the owner and registration numbers mustbe clearly visible on the vehicle. In the past, owners have been allowed to register under nicknames and use fancy let-tering for their registration numbers. Suchpractices sometimes made it difficult forenforcement personnel to identify asnowmobile's owner. The bill also would require snowmobilers under 18 to wear helmets. And the measurewould allow for an indicator to be placed onthe driver's license or state identificationcard of any individual who completes a snow-mobile safety training program. Under the omnibus DWI measure, snowmobilers would be subject to the sameDWI laws for repeat offenders that apply toautomobile drivers.32 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYBills awaiting Gov. Arne Carlson's signature aim to expand safety training requirements, improve enforcement of snowmobile laws, and crack down on drunken snowmobilers. Thirty-two peoplewere killed in snowmobile accidents, the most since 1972. Individuals convicted of a first offense for operating a snowmobile while intoxicatedwould be prohibited from operating a snow-mobile for one year. The penalties for repeat offenders would include driver's license suspension, manda-tory alcohol assessment, extended proba-tion and monitoring, vehicle forfeiture forcertain repeat offenses, and the civil andcriminal penalties for refusing to take a blood-alcohol test. TAXES Omnibus tax bill For many members of the 80th Legisla- ture, reforming the state's property tax sys-tem topped the year's political agenda. OnMay 19, the House passed a bill that, in thewords of some members, may not contain allthe elements of reform, but certainly pro-vides a measure of relief. \"This bill doesn't achieve final reform \u2014 and given the resources allotted toward thatthis year, it wasn't possible,\" said Rep. DeeLong the HouseTaxes Committee. \"It doesn't accomplish allthe goals, but it puts us on the road.\" HF2163 , which passed May 19 on a 127-6 vote, also contains revisions to the state'ssales and income tax codes and changes tothe Tax Increment Financing (TIF) mecha-nism, along with dozens of other tax provi-sions. The bill awaits Gov. Arne Carlson's signature. Property tax reform, relief Under HF2163 , most Minnesota taxpay- ers would receive a rebate of some sort,based on the amount of property taxes theypaid in 1997. The rebate, which would itself be taxable, could be taken as a credit againsttaxes owed for 1998 or refunded directly tothe taxpayer. Homeowners would get back 20 percent of their 1997 property tax paid, while renterswould receive 18 percent of that portion oftheir rent that constituted property tax pay-ments. There is no cap on the rebate amount.(Art. 1, Sec. 16) HF2163 would cut the rates for many of the property tax categories, with commer-cial/industrial properties enjoying some ofthe largest reductions. Beginning with taxespayable in 1998, the rate at which the firsttier of the commercial property classifica-tion is taxed would fall from 3 percent to 2.7percent. The upper tier would be set at 4percent, down from 4.6 percent. (Art. 1,Secs. 6-9) The bill also would compress the rate struc- ture \u2014 that is, spread the levies more evenlyacross the existing classes. For example, the value of properties that qualify for the firsttier of the residential homestead classifica-tion would increase to $75,000 from $72,000,while the first-tier value of commercial/in-dustrial properties would expand to $150,000from $100,000. (Art. 1, Secs. 6-9) The levy charged on market-rate apart- ments also would fall, from 3.4 percent to 2.9percent. (Art. 1, Sec. 8) Low-income housing would be treated as a single classification and become subject tonew guidelines. In exchange, the propertieswould be taxed at a rate of 1 percent. (Art. 1,Sec. 8) To qualify for the reduced rate, the unit would have to be certified by the MinnesotaHousing Finance Agency as meeting mini-mum housing standards and occupied byindividuals who meet income guidelines.Moreover, the unit would be subject to afive-year rent restriction and, in the metro-politan area, at least 20 percent of the apart-ments would have to be made available tofamilies that qualify for Section 8 certifi-cates, the federal government's rent subsidyprogram. (Art. 1, Sec 4) The bill, which would reduce the General Education Levy and increase the state's shareof education funding from 60 to 65 percentof the total, also would allow taxpayers aneducation homestead credit. This credit,equal to roughly 32 percent of the property'sgeneral education tax, could not exceed $225.(Art. 1, Sec. 12) Wind energy conversion systems used to generate electrical power also would becomesubject to increased property tax levies. Whilesmall-scale systems (those that generate lessthan two megawatts of electricity) built afterJan. 1, 1991, would be exempt, all other wind An omnibus tax bill, awaiting the governor's signature, does little to reform the property tax systemin Minnesota, but it does promise property owners a one-time, 20 percent tax rebate.May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 33power stations would be taxed at higher levels. (Art. 2, Sec. 7) Senior citizen deferrals Taxpayers over the age of 65 could defer a portion of their property tax burden if they'velived in their homes for more than 15 yearsand their total annual household incomedoes not exceed $30,000. A senior citizen could defer up to 5 per- cent of the total household income, not toexceed an aggregate value of 75 percent ofthe property's worth. In exchange, the countytreasurer would issue a lien against the prop-erty, payable when the house is sold, theowner dies or discontinues the deferment,or the property no longer qualifies as a home-stead. The provision is aimed at preventing se- nior citizens who live on fixed incomes frombeing priced out of their homes by risingproperty values and taxes. (Art. 14) The budget reserve The state's budget surplus is estimated at $2.3 billion and HF2163 would use some of that money to accomplish the changes to theproperty tax code. The bill establishes a Prop-erty Tax Reform Account of $46 millionspecifically for that purpose and appropri-ates another $46 million for the account in2000. (Art. 9, Sec. 2) The bill also mandates a budget reserve of $522 million, effective July 1, 1997. (Art. 9,Sec. 5) Levy limits and tax truth HF2163 also would impose levy limits on communities. The commissioner of the De-partment of Revenue would determine alevy limit base for each municipality, using1997 figures weighted for inflation and popu-lation increases. Property taxes within a givencommunity would then be limited to thatbase figure, minus the amount of generalpurpose aids provided by the state. Some exceptions do exist, though. Com- munities could administer new levies thathad been approved by referendum or tocope with floods or other natural disasters.Levies to meet fund-matching requirementsassociated with federal or state programsalso are excepted. (Art. 3, Secs. 1-9) The bill also defines changes to the state's Truth-in-Taxation laws. School districtswould be required to certify to county audi-tors their proposed levies and break themdown into three components: the state-de-termined amount, the voter-approved leviesand any remaining sum. This breakdownwould, in turn, be clearly itemized on theproperty tax notices sent to taxpayers. (Art. 4, Sec. 1) Communities would also have to provide more specific budget information in news-paper advertisements pertaining to publichearings of property tax matters. Currently,the ads merely state the time and place of thehearing. (Art. 4, Sec. 5) Income tax provisions HF2163 contains a number of changes to the state's income tax code, providing sev-eral new income tax credits to Minnesotataxpayers. The bill would provide a tax credit for insurance premiums related to long-termcare coverage, if the policy provided a mini-mum of $100,000 worth of benefits and in-cluded the inflation protection specified byfederal law. Taxpayers could take 25 percentof their premiums not deducted for federaltax purposes as a credit, up to $100 perindividual. The credit would become effective for taxes payable in 1999. (Art. 5, Sec. 7) HF2163 also would create a job-training tax credit that could be taken against thecorporate franchise tax. Employers of peoplewho have graduated from an approved train-ing program could receive a credit \u2014 up to$20,000 per employee \u2014 for each traineehired. The credit would essentially reim-burse the company for fees paid to the train-ing program. The credit is aimed at moving people into the workforce by allowing charitable organi-zations to train low-income, underskilled,individuals who might otherwise fall throughsociety's safety net. (Art. 5, Sec. 8)Programs would have to be certified by the commissioner of the Department ofChildren, Families and Learning, and pro-vide education in basic skills, thinking skills,and personal qualities. The program wouldhave to spend at least $5,000 per student andlast for at least six months. Upon gradua-tion, the jobs in which trainees are placedwould have to pay at least $9 per hour duringthe first year, and $10 per hour thereafter. The state would provide up to $1.2 million in job-training credits over the next fiveyears. (Art. 5, Sec. 8) The bill also imposes new regulations on third-party bulk income-tax filers, such aspayroll services, and calls for a handful ofnew taxation studies; most notably on busi-ness and telecommunications taxes. (Art. 5,Secs. 10,18) Sales tax changes The bill includes an array of sales-tax ex- emptions. Currently, the state draws a distinction between capital equipment, which is alreadyexempt from sales tax, and replacement capi-tal equipment, which is subject to a declin-ing rate that is administered through a refundmechanism. HF2163 would eliminate this distinction and the refund process, exempting all capitalequipment at the time of purchase, effectiveJune 30, 1998. The revenue department esti-mates this move would cost the state morethan $76 million in the coming biennium.(Art. 7, Sec. 8) \"Inputs\" used for taxable services, such as laundry, dry cleaning, building maintenance,telephone and cable television, and country The omnibus tax bill would permanently exempt the purchases of used farm machineryfrom the state sales tax.34 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYclub dues also would be exempted from the sales tax. Thus, the chemicals used in dry clean-ing or building maintenance, for example,would become tax-free. (Art. 7, Sec. 19) The bill would extend the sales tax to certain items that are now tax-free. For in-stance, unheated, ready-to-eat food, such assandwiches and salads sold at supermarkets,would become taxable, as would pre-paidtelephone cards. (Art. 7, Sec. 4) Tax Increment Financing Many communities have come to rely on Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts tocreate economic development. Using TIF, a local government would cre- ate a specific district in which property taxvalues are frozen. As a developer proceedswith a project, the increase in property valueover the frozen amount, known as the incre-ment, would be diverted from the normalrevenue stream (education finance, local ser-vices, etc.) to finance the economic develop-ment. A recent report by the Office of the Legis- lative Auditor determined that, in manycases, communities have incorrectly appliedthe state's existing TIF dollars. As a result,HF2163 contains new provisions designed to crack down on the abuses of TIF through-out the state. Although the TIF provisions in the final version of HF2163 aren't as strong as they were in previous incarnations, the bill wouldrequire development authorities to conductphysical, on-site inspections of propertiesbeing considered for TIF action. In addition,the bill imposes a number of restrictions onthe uses to which TIF money can be put, andadopts explicit definitions aimed at tighten-ing the use of TIF district creation. (Art. 10,Secs. 1-10) Mandates on local governments HF2163 also regulates the imposition of state mandates on local governments. Thebill would require the Department of Fi-nance to report to the Legislative Coordinat-ing Commission on the financial impact ofnew rules on local governments. Moreover, legislative staff would have to prepare fiscal notes detailing the impact onlocal governments of bills introduced in theLegislature. The notes must accompany anybill that would impose a new mandate. Thisprovision would require detailed explana-tions of how and why a mandate was beingimposed. (Art. 11, Secs. 1-6)Regional development commissions Reining in urban sprawl has become a priority for many legislators. If HF2163 be- comes law, the bill would allow local govern-ments to establish regional developmentcommissions aimed at fostering cooperativegrowth policies. The commissions, with members chosen by the governor or his designee, would re-view and comment on local developmentplans. Each year, the commission would berequired to produce a report on its activities.(Art. 12, Sec. 7, 21) Taxing minerals The body of tax law surrounding Minnesota's bountiful mineral resources alsowould change under HF2163 . For example, high-yield ore would be sub- ject to an additional tax of 3 cents per ton,beginning in 1997, for each percentage pointby which the ore exceeds 72 percent iron.(Art. 8, Sec. 7) The bill also reduces the taconite develop- ment fund from 20.4 cents per ton to 15.4 centsper ton for 1998 and 1999. (Art. 8, Sec. 8) Taxing trash HF2163 would impose the solid waste management tax on residential generatorsand political subdivisions that provide solidwaste management services to residentialgenerators. Vendors would collect the 9.75percent tax when they sell the bags or stickersused in waste collection. (Art. 13, Sec. 7) Commercial generators would be taxed at 17 percent of the price of their waste man-agement services. (Art. 13, Sec. 8) Solid-waste fees imposed by local govern- ments, though, would be exempt from thetax, as would a variety of materials, includ-ing waste generated outside Minnesota andsome recycled waste. (Art. 13, Sec. 11) Part of the tax revenue \u2014 $22 million or 50 percent, whichever is greater \u2014 would bedeposited into the state's solid waste fund.The remainder would be directed into thegeneral fund. (Art. 13, Sec. 18) Other provisions The bill also contains a number of miscel- laneous measures, many of which wouldallow specific local governments to enactparticular taxes within their jurisdictions.Hennepin County, for example, would im-pose a deed and mortgage tax, as wouldRamsey County, and cigarette retailers couldpass on manufacturers' discounts as lowerprices under the Unfair Cigarette Sales Tax.(Art. 16) Local government associations also wouldhave to disclose the amount of money they spend hiring state government lobbyists.(Art. 16, Sec. 1) HF2163 also updates the state's tax code with respect to changes in the federal system.(Art. 6) TECHNOLOGY Electronic signatures A new law brings Minnesota businesses one step closer to thedigital age, and gives electronicsignatures the full force of legalprotection. The Minnesota Electronic Au- thentication Act allows for the full authenti-cation of documents transmitted betweencomputers. The process relies on a set of twocryptographic key codes built around one-of-a-kind mathematical formulas known asalgorithms. One key, held privately by theuser, encodes documents with a digital sig-nature; the other is held in trust by a publiccertification authority and used by recipi-ents to verify an encoded document'sintegrity. The law defines the rules of the digital authentication system and mandates thatthe secretary of state set up a transitionalpublic certification authority until privatesector firms, which would be licensed andregulated by the secretary's office, can step inand take over the verification process. It alsospells out the range of liability assumed bythe system's subscribers and provides penal-ties for acts of fraud. Perhaps most importantly, House spon- sor Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) has said,the entire electronic signature system wouldremain voluntary. Businesses would not berequired to participate. Moreover, the statewould not assume any financial burden be-cause the cost of doing business would beassumed by the private sector firms \u2014 whocould set whatever price the market couldbear \u2014 when they take over as certificationauthorities. Kahn estimated that July 1998 would be the earliest the system could go on-line. Thelaw calls for the Office of the Secretary ofState to adopt rules, effective July 12, 1998,to implement the law.

The editorsTransportation bill signed Gov. Arne Carlson signed the omnibus transportation financebill into law May 16. The new lawappropriates $3 billion in statedollars for roads, bridges, tran-sit, aviation, and public safety. Sen. Jane Ranum (DFL-North Branch) and Rep. Bernie Lieder (DFL- Crookston)sponsored the bill. Transit The Metropolitan Council, which runs the metropolitan area's public transporta-tion system, will receive $100.7 million. Ofthat money, $2 million will go to help peopleleaving welfare obtain work-related trans-portation, and $34.6 million will go to MetroMobility, which provides rides to approxi-mately 25,000 metropolitan-area people withdisabilities. The council is also prohibited from rais- ing fares for regular bus service during the1998-1999 biennium. (Art. 1, Sec. 3) A total of $27 million will go to assist transit programs in Greater Minnesota. Anadditional $925,000 is appropriated to helpeconomically disadvantaged people outsidethe Twin Cities metropolitan area with work-related transportation. (Art. 1, Sec. 1) Road and bridge construction State road construction projects will re- ceive $1.6 billion for the next two years.Local roads will get $841.6 million in stateaid. (Art. 1, Sec. 2) Public safety The new law calls for $102.9 million in spending for the Minnesota State Patrol.(The governor refused to enact a speed limitincrease called for by lawmakers in 1996because funding for new troopers was miss-ing.) Also included is $2.1 million for com- puter-aided dispatching and records man-agement, and $1.7 million to install videocameras in state patrol vehicles. Another $69.5 million goes to the department's Driver and Vehicle Services Di-vision over the next biennium. Also, $2.6 mil-lion goes to the Department of Public Safetyand the Minnesota Safety Council for variouspublic safety programs. (Art. 1, Sec. 4) Aviation The law appropriates $36.3 million for airtransportation programs, including $26 mil- lion for airport development and assistance.Other funds support the Civil Air Patrol andprovide general support for aviation in thestate. (Art. 1, Sec. 2) Railroads and waterways A total of $3.9 million will go to fund rail and water transportation. This includes a $1million study to look at using existing freightrailroad corridors for a commuter rail ser-vice in the metropolitan area. (Art. 1, Sec. 2) Communications system A total of $9.9 million over the biennium will be used to pay for equipment and per-sonnel to build a digital radio communica-tions system that eventually will link all metroarea public safety personnel. In 1996, the state made a $15 million bonding commitment to such a system us-ing radio channels in the 800 megahertzrange. (The Metropolitan Council also wasgiven $13 million in bonding authority forthe project.) The channels can be \"trunked,\"or connected, so that several police, ambu-lance, or fire personnel could talk simulta-neously across a number of channels. Currently, individual police departments, for example, communicate on separate ra-dio bands, which sometimes creates prob-lems when different departments need totalk to one another. (Art. 1, Sec. 2) Traveling to work A total of $2.9 million in grant funds rec- ognizes the increasing number of those mov-ing from welfare to work as a result of newstate and federal legislation. Exactly $2 million will go to organizations in the metro area and $925,000 to those inGreater Minnesota who will also seek federalor private dollars to transport economicallydisadvantaged people to jobs and employ-ment-related activities, including child care. The state funds could be used to subsidize worker bus fares, enhance public transpor-tation service, or provide transportation forworkers. (Art. 1, Secs. 2-3) City bus to school The Metropolitan Council, in conjunc- tion with the Minneapolis and St. Paul schoolboards, will develop a plan to use publicbuses to carry school kids to and from school(at no cost to the student). An advisorycouncil composed of government, schooland union officials, parents and studentswill also assist in formulating the plan, whichwill be submitted to the Legislature by Jan.30, 1998. The plan should accommodate atleast 75 percent of students in the two dis- tricts who are in grades 9-12 and be ready forthe 1998-1999 school year, and in subse-quent years for those in grades seven andeight as well. (Art. 1, Sec. 3) HF1881*/SF none/CH159 Title transfers Car buyers who fail to promptly transfer the title on the vehiclewill face new penalties under anew state law. Some car buyers do not trans- fer the title on a vehicle for avariety of reasons, according to House sponsor Rep. Ron Erhardt (R-Edina).For example, the buyer may not want to payfor insurance or may not have a driver'slicense. (State law requires proof of insur-ance and a valid driver's license in order toobtain a title.) To get around the law, some illegal drivers buy cheap used cars with plenty of time lefton the tabs and do not follow title transferrequirements. When a title is not transferred, problems can arise for car sellers, who may be heldliable for parking tickets or other infractionsoccurring after the vehicle has been sold. Under existing law, it is a misdemeanor for a buyer to fail to apply for a title transferwithin 14 days of acquiring a vehicle. Thenew law, effective Aug. 1, will give buyersjust 10 days to apply for a title transfer andpay the necessary fees. The Department of Public Safety will be able to suspend the registration on the ve-hicle if the buyer does not transfer the titlewithin 10 days of the sale, under the law. If the vehicle registration is suspended, the buyer will have to pay an additional $5reinstatement fee in addition to the normaltitle transfer charges. If after 14 days thebuyer still has not transferred the title, anadditional $2 late fee will be applied. Also, law enforcement officers will be able to impound a vehicle if the registration hasbeen suspended because the buyer failed totransfer the title. Sen. Claire Robling (R-Prior Lake) spon- sored the Senate proposal. HF609/SF1404*/CH13536 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYSigned by the governorRegulating brokers Minnesota will regulate auto- mobile brokers under legislationsigned by Gov. Arne Carlson. Under the law, carried in the House by Rep. Matt Entenza(DFL-St. Paul), brokers will be considered motor vehicle dealers who mustbe licensed by the state. Wholesalers, auc-tioneers, scrap metal processors and salvagelots, along with new- or used-car sales com-panies, already are considered motor vehicledealers. A broker, as defined by the law, is anyone who arranges the sale or lease of a motorvehicle and collects a fee for the service. To obtain a license, brokers must main- tain a commercial space, either owned out-right or leased for at least one year, dedicatedto operating the brokerage. The broker alsomust observe \"conspicuously posted\" busi-ness hours and have either personnel or ananswering service on hand to field consumerquestions. The law also imposes a handful of new requirements on brokers, in addition to thelicense procedure. For example, brokers cannegotiate sale or lease prices, but may notrepresent themselves as the seller of the ve-hicle, and the broker may not accept a downpayment of more than $500. Brokers also areprohibited from the actual business of mo-tor vehicle sales, including executing con-tracts, describing warranties or safetyfeatures, and performing any pre-sale prepa-rations to the vehicle that would normally bethe domain of a dealer. The law, which becomes effective Aug. 1, 1997, also outlines penalties brokers may besubject to if they violate any of its licensing orsales provisions. Sen. Linda Scheid (DFL-Brooklyn Park) sponsored the Senate proposal. HF890/SF890*/CH92 Signed by the governor Signed by the governorSelling abandoned vehicles Minneapolis and St. Paul po- lice will be required to hold im-pounded vehicles for only 15 daysbefore putting them on the auc-tion block under a new state law. Signed May 6 by Gov. Arne Carlson, the law will address a problem thatleaves Minneapolis and St. Paul impoundlots overflowing with cars abandoned bytheir owners. Current state law requires a 45-day wait before an impounded vehicle can be sold.The new law will exempt Minneapolis andSt. Paul from that law and set a 15-day limit for those cities. The law requires local approval by the city councils in Minneapolis and St. Paul beforeit takes effect. Supporters of the new measure said cur- rent law causes real problems in the cities,especially during winter months. A winterthat brings heavy snowfall leads to a lot ofparking violations and a lot of cars beingtowed from city streets to the impound lot. In St. Paul, where the city impound lot holds 750 vehicles, space in the lot can runout quickly, according to St. Paul PoliceDeputy Chief Ted Brown. Most people pay the fine and pick up their cars from the impound lot within a few days,but others would rather lose their vehiclesthan pay up, according to Brown. As a result,vehicles that \u2014 in effect \u2014 are abandonedmust be allowed to take up valuable lot spacefor 45 days before they can be sold off. Rep. Jim Farrell (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. Randy Kelly (DFL-St. Paul) sponsored themeasure. HF342/SF166*/CH108 Young drivers A new law will ensure that 15- year-olds are allowed restricteddriver's licenses to help out onthe family farm. The measure, effective April 24, 1997, provides an exception to a previous law requiring anyone under age 18to hold a learner's permit for at least sixmonths before becoming eligible for a driver'slicense. The 1996 Legislature passed the new learner's permit requirements, which tookeffect Feb. 1, 1997, with hopes that the lawwould give teenagers more driving experi-ence before they can hit the road on theirown. But the law had an unintended side effect, according to House sponsor Rep. TorreyWestrom (R-Elbow Lake). It cut in half thetime farm families could benefit from a statelaw allowing 15-year-olds to get restricteddriver's licenses allowing them to help withfarm business. Restrictions placed on such licenses allow 15-year-olds whose parents are farmers todrive only during daylight hours and onlywithin 20 miles of the family farm. The new law exempts 15-year-olds who are otherwise eligible for a restricted farmdriver's license from the new six-monthlearner's permit requirement. Sen. Jim Vickerman (DFL-Tracy) spon- sored the Senate proposal. HF768/SF475*/CH48Travel time slashed Speed limits would increase on Minne- sota interstates and divided highways undera bill awaiting action from Gov. Arne Carlson. The proposal calls for speed limits to jump from 65 mph to 70 mph on rural interstates,from 55 mph to 65 mph on metropolitanarea interstates, and from 55 mph to 65 mphon four-lane, divided highways throughoutthe state. The proposed speed limit hikes are in- cluded in a bill ( HF458/SF724* ) sponsored by Rep. Al Juhnke (DFL-Willmar). Last year, lawmakers moved to boost the speed limit to 65 mph on rural, dividedhighways, but Gov. Arne Carlson blockedthe increase by ordering the commissionerof transportation to maintain the current 55mph limit on such roads. The current proposal would void that or- der, reinstating the speed limit increase ap-proved by the Legislature last year. And thebill would add new increases. Carlson has said that he will not allow an increase in speed limits unless it is accompa-nied by additional funding to hire more statetroopers to tighten up enforcement. Juhnke'sbill does not include any such funding.

Under current law, voters must provide one of several reasons to vote outside anofficial polling place: an expected absencefrom the precinct, illness, disability, reli-gious discipline, observance of a religiousholiday, or service as an election judge inanother precinct. The bill would have elimi-nated those provisions. It also would have permitted military per- sonnel stationed overseas to vote by fax, ascould hospital patients admitted within sevendays of an election. Gov. Arne Carlson supported the military vote by fax, but had \"serious reservations\" inallowing hospital patients to do so. He spe-cifically cited the \"potential impact of any ofthe proposed changes to the integrity of ourelection laws,\" and noted that only threeRepublicans supported the bill. \"Significant changes to election laws . . . are too important to be entirely one-sidedand lacking in bipartisanship,\" he said. Bill sponsors said they were only looking to increase voter turnout. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Tom Osthoff (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. John Marty(DFL-Roseville). HF74/SF78*/CH166 Caucuses: lowering the age A bill to open up part of the elections process to 17-year-olds was vetoed by thegovernor. Under the proposal, anyone 17 years old at the time of precinct caucuses could haveparticipated as a delegate or voter. \"This is a responsibility best left to mature eligible voters and goes well beyond simplyincreasing a young person's interest and par-ticipation in the political process,\" Carlsonsaid. He expressed concern that an ineligiblevoter would be able to influence or deny theselection of a candidate. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Andy Dawkins, (DFL-St. Paul) and Sen. LindaScheid (DFL-Brooklyn Park). HF703/SF1170*/CH168Keeping track of voters A bill calling for the U.S. Postal Service to provide the Office of the Secretary of Statewith the names of people who file perma-nent change of address orders has been ve-toed. The intent of the bill was to improve record-keeping as well as to encourage vot-ing. But Gov. Arne Carlson thought \"the un- intended outcome of this process may actu-ally be more confusion on the part of theelectorate, in which case the status quo iscertainly preferable.\" Under the bill, the postal service would have provided the secretary of state's officewith the lists each month. The office wouldhave provided the list to county auditors,who were to send registered voters informa-tion about their new polling places. About 25,000 Minnesotans change resi- dences each year. At present, the secretary ofstate's office has no way of tracking them. Carlson said \"efficiency and accuracy within the electoral system is best accom-plished the way it always has been \u2014 lettingthose who exercise their right to vote toregister in their new precinct.\" The measure was sponsored by Rep. Betty Folliard (DFL-Hopkins) and Sen. John Marty(DFL-Roseville). HF294/SF73*/CH167St. Louis Park cleanup vetoed Gov. Arne Carlson vetoed a bill which would have authorized the cleanup of a con-taminated site in St. Louis Park. The siteknown as NL Industries/Tara Corp./GoldenAuto would have been made a high-prioritysite for receipt of contamination cleanupfunds. In his veto message, Carlson said that current law contains a detailed process forapplication and review of contaminationcleanup grants and that the project had notgone through that process. \"Funding of projects outside the existing competitive process undermines the objec-tive and comprehensive process that is cur-rently in place,\" Carlson wrote. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Richard Jefferson (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. Steve Kelley(DFL-Hopkins). HF1755*/SF1584/CH165ELECTIONS LABOR Minimum wage hike Saying he would not accept changes to Minnesota's minimum wage law that do notconform to the federal law, Gov. Arne Carlsonvetoed a bill May 16 to raise the state mini-mum wage. A House motion May 19 toAs of May 22, Gov. Arne Carlson has vetoed 11 bills and line-item vetoed appropriationsfrom another bill. 38 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLYLOCAL GOVERNMENToverride the governor's veto failed on a vote of 82-52. A two-thirds majority (90 votes) isneeded for a veto override. The House first passed the bill on a 90-43 vote May 14, but several Republicans whothen voted for the bill voted against theoverride attempt. Carlson's veto was prompted by what the bill lacked rather what it would do. Carlsonwanted provisions for a tip credit and anopportunity wage. A tip credit would allowemployers of workers receiving tips to makea deduction from hourly wages paid. Theopportunity wage is often called a trainingwage because it allows employers to pay aworker under 20 years of age $4.25 an hourfor the first 90 days on the job. House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum (R- Kenyon) distributed a letter from CarlsonMay 19 proposing a compromise on the tipcredit issue. Sviggum urged lawmakers totake the offer seriously. But bill sponsor Rep. Tom Rukavina (DFL- Virginia) ignored Sviggum's suggestion andurged his Republican colleagues to overridethe veto. Under HF892 , the minimum wage for employees of large businesses (those withannual gross sales in excess of $500,000)would have risen to $5.15 per hour. Workersat smaller companies would have been paidat least $4.90 per hour. Carlson vetoed similar proposed mini- mum wage increases in 1994 and 1996. Currently in Minnesota, there are three separate minimum wage levels. Businesseswith more than $362,500 in annual salesmust pay their workers at least $4.25 anhour, while companies with lesser sales mustpay a minimum of $4 per hour. A federallymandated $5-per-hour minimum wage af-fects only those businesses with annual grosssales in excess of $500,000. The federal levelwill increase to $5.15 on Sept. 1. Union sign-up recognition A bill that would have allowed public sec- tor employees to unionize without holdingelections was vetoed by Gov. Arne CarlsonMay 9. The bill would have required public sector employers to recognize and the commis-sioner of the state Department of Labor andIndustry to certify an employees' union oncethe union had signed up 60 percent of thework force. Current state law requires that workers select a union through a secret ballot elec-tion process. In his veto message Carlson wrote that thebill would \"irreparably harm the relation- ship between public employees and man-agement.\" He added that \"the certification election process now in place ensures that publicemployees are guaranteed a fair procedurefree of intimidation and coercion when de-ciding upon their right to organize. This billwould upset these existing safeguards.\" The measure was sponsored by Rep. Rob Leighton (DFL-Austin) and Sen. JohnHottinger (DFL-Mankato). HF1106/SF1693*/CH115 Binding arbitration A bill to mandate a binding arbitration process during initial contract negotiationsbetween an employer and a union was ve-toed by Gov. Arne Carlson. \"Mandating third party intervention dur- ing the initial contracting stage would upsetthe delicate balance of interests inherent tothe employer/employee relationship,\" hesaid. Carlson also thought the legislation would be pre-empted by the National Labor Rela-tions Act, which stipulates that both partiesto an arbitration must voluntarily submit tothe process. \"I will not support legislation which will lead the state to needless litigation,\" he said. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Mary Murphy (DFL-Hermantown) and Sen. EllenAnderson (DFL-St. Paul). HF1936*/SF1823/CH152 Government worker protection A bill detailing the rights of employees when local governments consolidate andmust issue layoffs was vetoed by Gov. ArneCarlson May 9. The bill would have allowed displaced local government employees to remain withtheir original employer if the employees hadseniority rights under a union contract. Italso would have required that new serviceproviders hire \u2014 in order of seniority \u2014from those being laid off by the local govern-ment unit. \"This bill is nothing more than a state mandate dictating how local governmentsshould handle labor relations,\" Carlson wrotein his veto message. \"It mandates a series ofpersonnel policies which should be left tothe local management process or collectivebargaining.\" Carlson said the bill might have prevented the hiring of employees based on qualifica-tions and forced local governments to hire more employees than needed. Statemicromanagement of public employee rela-tions could threaten innovation and con-solidation of services, Carlson said. The proposal was sponsored by Rep. Luanne Koskinen (DFL-Coon Rapids) andSen. Linda Higgins (DFL-Mpls). HF1078/SF854*/CH116 Met Council elections A bill to transform the Metropolitan Coun- cil into an elective body was vetoed by Gov.Arne Carlson. \"An elected Metropolitan Council is about as necessary as another house of the Legisla-ture,\" he said. The Metropolitan Council, created in 1967, is responsible for comprehensive re-gional planning for the seven-county metro-politan area. One of the largest regionalgovernments in the nation, it also overseesthe regional bus system, several wastewatertreatment facilities, and Metro Mobility, atransit operation serving the disabled. It hasan annual budget of about $360 million,which is partially paid by property taxes, andmanages about 3,500 employees. The coun-cil is governed by a board of 17 membersappointed by the governor, each represent-ing a different portion of the metro region. \"An elected council would, by design, force council members to be parochial to theirown constituents and individual districts,\"Carlson said. He also opposed financingcouncil elections with council funds andsaid criticism leveled at the council is unfair.Instead, fault lies with the Legislature,Carlson said, because of its \"unabashed will-ingness . . . to place increased demands council.\" House sponsor Rep. Myron Orfield (DFL- Mpls) has pushed for an elected council ineach of the last four sessions. \"The Metropolitan Council is the second largest unit of local government in the state\"behind Hennepin County, Orfield has said,arguing that when an official body has asmuch authority as the council, it should beand usually is elected. \"Taxation withoutrepresentation is fundamentally contrary toour constitution .\" Sen. Carol Flynn (DFL-Mpls) sponsored the proposal in the Senate. HF423*/SF175/CH151May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKL Y 39RETIREMENTHIGHER EDUCATIONMinneapolis construction Gov. Arne Carlson struck down legisla- tion May 13 that would have allowed Min-neapolis to maintain its own licensingprogram for building contractors andremodelers through 2005. The Legislature enacted a statewide li- censing procedure for contractors in 1991that supersedes the local requirements. TheMinneapolis program is set to expire in 2000. \"Any advantages of a distinct licensure program by Minneapolis are greatly out-weighed by the needless duplication inher-ent within such a parallel arrangement,\"Carlson wrote in a letter announcing hisveto decision. \"Moreover, a unique licen-sure program could give unfair advantage toa certain group of building contractor andremodelers.\" Minneapolis officials, including Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton, had testified beforethe House Commerce, Tourism and Con-sumer Affairs Committee that the state'slicensing procedure did not provide adequateprotection for residents, given the advancedage of much of the city's housing stock. The proposal was sponsored by Rep. Linda Wejcman (DFL-Mpls) and Sen. LindaHiggins (DFL-Mpls). HF970/SF868*/CH146 Pension veto A largely technical bill addressing the pen- sions of public employees from firefightersto pipefitters was vetoed May 13 by Gov.Arne Carlson.Carlson agreed that most of the bill, which exceeds 100 pages, addressed \"genuine needsand resolve[d] serious problems in the pen-sion and retirement policy area.\" But hecited four specific trouble spots with themeasure: First, the bill creates a problem by extend- ing state pension coverage to seasonal em-ployees of the Department of Revenue.Carlson said the move would cost the state$91,000 annually, and the bill provides nofunding; Second, it allows employees of the Minne- sota Zoological Garden, the Lola and RudyPerpich Center for Arts Education, and thestate academies for the blind and deaf todevelop Individual Retirement Accountplans, rather than have their pensions con-trolled by the Minnesota State RetirementSystem. Carlson said the move would \"de-stabilize the funding of defined benefitplans\"; Third, the bill moves certain control of appropriations relating to state police andfire aid from the Department of Revenueto the Department of Finance. Since therevenue department administers both pro-grams, the appropriation authority shouldremain there, Carlson said. And finally, it allows a part-time teacher in Minneapolis to make a lump sum backpayment to cover a period of time when noretirement contributions were made. Whileadmitting the provision held no cost forthe state, Carlson objected, saying it \"couldapply to many members and should bethoroughly examined before this policy iscreated.\"No loan forgiveness Gov. Arne Carlson used his line- item veto authority to strike$100,000 from the omnibushigher education finance bill May20. The money would have funded the \"Loan Repayment Assistance\" programfor graduates of Minnesota law schools work-ing as lawyers in the state. The vetoed language would have repaid the law school loans of barristers who metincome guidelines and provide legal servicesfor the economically disadvantaged or non-profit organizations, Native American tribalgovernments, or public defense offices. Carlson, in his veto message announcing the action, pointed out that he vetoed asimilar provision last year. \"My position on the use of state funding for this purpose has not changed,\" Carlsonwrote. The measure was sponsored by Rep. Gene Pelowski (DFL-Winona) and Sen. LeRoyStumpf (DFL-Thief River Falls). HF2136/SF1888*/CH183The proposal was sponsored by Rep. Phyllis Kahn (DFL-Mpls) and Sen.

HF1129/SF995*/CH139 Minnesota's Clean Indoor Air Act of 1975, which eventually restricted smok-ing in many public places, includinghospitals and child care centers, was arevolutionary crackdown seen as a vic-tory for non-smokers everywhere. Smokers should be advised that the 1901 Legislature had plans to go muchfurther. At the time, cigarettes were not in fashion. In fact, North Dakota hadbarred their sale for many years. Min-nesota state Sen. Charlie Halvorson wasnot a fan of smokes or smokers and introduced a bill to ban the sale of ciga-rettes in Minnesota. On Feb. 18, 1901,the bill passed the Senate with only fivenegative votes. The House held onto the bill for more than a month. Expected oppositionnever manifested, and the House, withan amendment, passed the bill March22, by a 72-36 margin. Four days later, the Senate took up the matter again.The body accepted the House amend-ment, but then rejected the measure25-27. The issue died that session. Although the sale of cigarettes is still permitted in the state, periodic changesdo continue to be made to the CleanIndoor Air Act. The latest, in 1994,prohibited smoking in common areasof apartment buildings, such as laundryrooms, mail rooms, and hallways. It's a fact!Line-item vetoed by the governor40 May 23, 1997 / SESSION WEEKLY Tracking the Bills . . . as of May 22, 1997 Exactly 4,258 bills were introduced by the Legislature during the regular session \u2014 2,255 by the House and 2,003 by the Senate. Of those, 251 bills (and four resolutions) were passedby both bodies during the 1997 session and sent to the governor. So what happened to the other 4,003? Some were duplicates, some were folded into other bills, but most are in limbo, awaiting legislative action when the next regular session beginson Jan. 20, 1998. And what happened to the 251 bills (and four resolutions) that have been sent to the governor? Most were signed into law, some were vetoed, and some are awaiting the governor's attention.Here's a quick review of the governor's veto authority during the first year of the biennium. Once a bill has passed both the House and the Senate in identical form, it's ready to be sent to the governor for consideration. The governor has several options when considering a bill.The governor can: sign the bill and it will become law; veto the bill; line-item veto individual items within an appropriations bill; or do nothing, which, in the first year of the biennium, results in the bill becoming law. The timing of these actions is as important as the actions themselves.But the important thing to remember in the first year of the biennium is this: the governor has three days from the time of \"presentment\" to veto a bill. If the governor doesn't sign the bill within this time frame, it will become law without his signature. (Sundays are not counted in the three-day time limit, but holidays are.) (For bills passed in the Special Session, however, the governor has 14 days from \"present- ment\" to veto them \u2014 the same rules that apply in the second year of a biennium. If thegovernor takes no action on a bill during this time, the bill is vetoed in what is commonlyreferred to as a \"pocket veto.\") Only on appropriations bills can the governor exercise the line-item veto authority. This option allows the governor to eliminate the appropriation items to which he/she objects. Aswith all vetoes, the governor must include a statement listing the reasons for the veto with thereturned bill. Here, too, the timetable is within three days after the governor receives the bill. A two-thirds vote of the members in each house is needed to override a veto. So the Legislature, either next year or when it is called into special session before then, could vote tooverride the governor's veto. The governor's veto authority is outlined in the Minnesota Constitution (Art. IV, Sec. 23).So what happens to the bills that weren't approved by the Legislature this year?Bills that were awaiting floor action on the General Orders Calendar now return to the last committee they were acted upon, where they will stay unless acted upon by the 1998Legislature. This rule also applies to any bill up for consideration on the Consent Calendar,Calendar, or Special Orders. For appointed conference committees that have not submitted a report upon adjournment, the bill returns to the body it originally came from and is laid on the table. The conferencecommittee is then disbanded. Bills that are passed by one body and not the other remain alive for the second year of the biennium. The house that approved the bill in the first year need not repass the bill in thesecond. Bills pending before the Rules and Legislative Administration Committee from either body return to the standing committee to which the bill was previously referred. Bills vetoed by the governor are returned to the body where the bill originated and laid on the table. Bills remaining in standing committees can be taken up in the second year of the biennium in the committee to which they were last referred. After each session, a comprehensive summary of all bills that were signed into law or vetoed is published.
