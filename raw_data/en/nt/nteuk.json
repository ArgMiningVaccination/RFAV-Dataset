Call your doctor right away if you have the following symptoms of an [allergic reaction](https://www.medicinenet.com/allergies_quiz/quiz.htm): - worsening of other medical problems in people who also use ProAir Digihaler including increases in blood [sugar](https://www.medicinenet.com/sugar_addiction_pictures_slideshow/article.htm) [low potassium](https://www.medicinenet.com/low_potassium_hypokalemia/article.htm)levels in your blood The most common side effects of ProAir Digihaler include: [urinary tract infection](https://www.medicinenet.com/urinary_tract_infection/article.htm) - your it is pounding or racing ( [palpitations](https://www.medicinenet.com/palpitations_overview/article.htm)) [chest pain](https://www.medicinenet.com/chest_pain/article.htm) - fast [dizziness](https://www.medicinenet.com/dizziness_dizzy/article.htm) [sore throat](https://www.medicinenet.com/sore_throat_pharyngitis/article.htm) [runny nose](https://www.medicinenet.com/runny_nose/symptoms.htm) These are not all of the possible side effects of ProAir Digihaler.

Bronchospasm - For treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm or [prevention](https://www.medicinenet.com/prevention/article.htm)of symptoms associated with bronchospasm, the recommended dosage for adults and children 4 years of age or older is 2 inhalations repeated every 4 to 6 hours. - More frequent administration or a larger number of inhalations is not recommended. In some patients, 1 inhalation every 4 hours may be sufficient. Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm - For prevention of [exercise](https://www.medicinenet.com/exercise_and_fitness_quiz/quiz.htm)-induced bronchospasm, the recommended dosage for adults and children 4 years of age or older is 2 inhalations 15 to 30 minutes before exercise.

Other short-acting sympathomimetic [bronchodilators](https://www.medicinenet.com/bronchodilators_for_asthma/article.htm) should not with ProAir Digihaler. If additional adrenergic [drugs](https://www.medicinenet.com/drugs_what_you_should_know_about_your_drugs/article.htm) are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects. Beta-Blockers - Beta-adrenergic-receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as ProAir Digihaler, but may produce severe bronchospasm in [asthmatic](https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_pictures_slideshow/article.htm)patients. - Therefore, patients with [asthma](https://www.medicinenet.com/asthma_quiz/quiz.htm)should not normally be treated with [beta-blockers](https://www.medicinenet.com/beta_blockers/article.htm). However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after [myocardial infarction](https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_attack/article.htm), there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic-blocking agents in patients with asthma. - In this setting, consider cardioselective beta-blockers, although they should be administered with caution. Diuretics - The [ECG](https://www.medicinenet.com/electrocardiogram_ecg_or_ekg/article.htm)changes and/or [hypokalemia](https://www.medicinenet.com/low_potassium_hypokalemia/article.htm)which may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. - Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non-potassium sparing diuretics. Consider monitoring potassium levels. Digoxin - Mean decreases of 16% and 22% in serum [digoxin](https://www.medicinenet.com/digoxin/article.htm)levels were demonstrated after single dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. - The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving albuterol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. - Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving ProAir Digihaler should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with [monoamine oxidase inhibitors](https://www.medicinenet.com/mao_inhibitors-oral/article.htm)or [tricyclic antidepressants](https://www.medicinenet.com/tricyclic_antidepressants-oral_injection/article.htm), or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the [cardiovascular system](https://www.medicinenet.com/heart_disease_pictures_slideshow_visual_guide/article.htm)may be potentiated. - Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAO inhibitors or tricyclic [antidepressants](https://www.medicinenet.com/antidepressants/article.htm). Is ProAir Digihaler safe to use while pregnant or breastfeeding? - There are no randomized clinical studies of use of albuterol during [pregnancy](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy_planning_preparing_for_pregnancy/article.htm). - Available data from published epidemiological studies and postmarketing case reports of pregnancy outcomes following inhaled albuterol use do not consistently demonstrate a risk of major [birth defects](https://www.medicinenet.com/birth_defects/article.htm)or [miscarriage](https://www.medicinenet.com/miscarriage_causes_and_symptoms/article.htm). - There are clinical considerations with use of albuterol in [pregnant](https://www.medicinenet.com/pregnancy/article.htm)women. - There are no available data on the presence of albuterol in [human milk](https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm), the effects on the [breastfed](https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm)child, or the effects on milk production. - However, plasma levels of albuterol after inhaled therapeutic doses are low in humans, and if present in [breast milk](https://www.medicinenet.com/breastfeeding/article.htm), albuterol has a low oral bioavailability.
