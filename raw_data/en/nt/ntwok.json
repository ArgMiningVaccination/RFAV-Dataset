The list of research projects for 2017 was collated by: \u0084Assessing which of the reported 2015-2016 projects were ongoing \u0084Auditing the online Research Governance Service for new projects commenced in 2017 \u0084Circulating the project list to Heads of Department, Heads of Service and clinical trials staff to check for completeness. The list of publications and other research activity was collated by: \u0084SMHS/EMHS library staff performing detailed searches on key investigators for 2017 publications \u0084Submissions provided by investigators on an agreed template ( Appendix A ). 4 SMHS Research Report 2017From the SMHS Chief Executive This report highlights the large volume of research activity conducted acro ss SMHS during 2017. It also demonstrates the high level of dedication of our staff in communicating and translating their research through publication. This is something of which we should all be proud. The past year has seen significant changes to the research environment with the ongoing implementation of the online Research Governance Service (RGS), which changed the process of research submission and review across WA Health. I would like to thank staff for their dedication to supporting the implementation of this system and the additional training and learning undertaken to facilitate its capability. In the future, the system will provide critical information about research activity within SMHS and WA Health more broadly. In 2017 we also saw the introduction of the National Mutual Acceptance (NMA) Scheme which aims to make it easier for WA sites to be included in national research projects without having to undergo additional ethical and scientific review. We are already starting to see a large number of projects coming to SMHS through this scheme. There is a large diversity of research conducted within SMHS with projects including sponsored clinical drug trials, national collaborative trials as well as a range of locally initiated projects aiming to improve patient outcomes. Research is critical to SMHS and the community it serves. It is a credit to our investigators that this research impacts beyond the local setting with the outcomes of these projects often having national and international significance. Paul Forden Chief Executive South Metropolitan Health Service 5 SMHS Research Report 2017Acknowledgements This Research Report was developed with contributions from: \u0084Researchers from multiple departments as detailed within this report \u0084Heads of Service, Clinical Trials Coordinators and administrative staff \u0084Staff from the SMHS/EMHS Library \u0084SMHS Research, Ethics and Governance (REG) Unit team members. 6 SMHS Research Report 2017Executive summary The South Metropolitan Health Service (SMHS) Board has outlined research as a key enabler to deliver on its strategic priority of Excellence in the delivery of safe, high quality clinical care .1 1 SMHS Strategic Plan 2017-2020 link 2 Melbourne Health link 3 2015-16 SMHS Research ReportIt is also recognised that research is a pivotal enabler of the other four strategic priorities of SMHS: \u0084Provide a great patient experience \u0084Engage, develop and provide opportunities for our workforce \u0084Strengthen relationships with our community and partners \u0084Achieve a productive and innovative organisation which is financially sustainable. The attraction and retention of credible researchers is extremely important to SMHS, as \"research is fundamental to achieve excellence in care and improve patient and consumer outcomes\".2 In 2017, the majority of research in SMHS has been conducted at Fiona Stanley Hospital (FSH). However, a significant number of projects involve collaboration across SMHS sites including Fremantle Hospital and Rockingham General Hospital (RGH). This report showcases research activity in FSFHG and RkPG and is a testament to the passion of our researchers and is worthy of celebration. SMHS has recently developed an operational plan for research which will provide the direction for research in SMHS over the next three years. This report aims to capture all research activity during a calendar year. It is important to note that many projects take place across a number of years and as such will appear in multiple annual reports. A number of the projects being conducted in 2017, and captured in this report, have been carried over from the 2015-2016 report. As such, the number of projects reported represents total research activity, rather than the number of new projects. In 2017, FSFHG was involved in 320 projects, which is an increase from the 2015 and 2016 SMHS Research Report3. This increase in projects was consistent across all services. The research activity at RkPG was consistent with the 2015-2016 report with 16 trials being conducted in 2017. In addition to the large number of projects being conducted, there were 347 publications produced in 2017, which is an increase compared to the previous two years (353 across both 2015 and 2016). These publications often involve collaboration across departments and services. For this report, these publications have been recorded once under a single department. Due to the methods used to collate the publications it is likely that some will have been missed if investigators have not self-reported. In addition, some researchers may have published under affiliations other than SMHS i.e. their respective universities. 7 SMHS Research Report 201792 ethics approvals granted in 2017155 governance approvals in 2017 Research projects 176 FSFHG Service One projects23 FSFHG Service Two projects 51 FSFHG Service Three projects 8 FSFHG Service Five projects 16 RkPG service projects42 FSFHG Service Four projects 20 FSFHG other service projects There were 92 ethics approvals granted in 2017 by the SMHS Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC). This is a decrease in the number of approvals from previous years, according to the 2015-2016 report (205 approvals in 2016 alone). This reduction in activity can be attributed to the separation of the Royal Perth Hospital HREC from SMHS, with the establishment of East Metropolitan Health Service (EMHS). There were 155 site authorisations processed by the SMHS governance team in 2017. This also represents a decrease from 211 in 2016. However, this can also be largely attributed to the separation of Royal Perth Hospital authorisations from SMHS. Table 1 below provides a high level summary of research activity by group and specialty/department /service for the 2017 calendar year.

Implementation of this system enabled WA Health to qualify for the National Mutual Acceptance Scheme in 2017. \u0084National Mutual Acceptance (NMA) Scheme 2017: Introduced in mid-2017 this process allows the HREC approval granted by a Lead HREC to be applicable across Australia (excluding the Northern Territory). This reduces duplication and promotes the inclusion of Western Australian sites in projects being led by other jurisdictions. \u0084Low risk fast track 2017: In late 2017 a low risk fast track process was trialled in an effort to reduce the time to approval for low risk research. The trial was a success and new processes have been implemented to review low risk projects through an expedited process. During the trial 25 projects were reviewed which resulted in 17 site authorisations and 5 ethics approvals. Only two studies received both ethics approval and site authorisation and 5 projects were still under review at the completion of the trial period but later received approval. Average time for ethics approval during the trial was 14 days. Average time for site authorisation during the trial was 4 days, with 50% completed in 2 days or less. Site authorisations were signed off by the Manager of the Research Ethics and Governance Unit. A number of recommendations were made at the conclusion of the trial. These are currently being implemented. 11 SMHS Research Report 201712 SMHS Research Report 2017Overview of SMHS research activity Ethics approvals, site authorisations (governance approvals) and project closure activity data for the calendar year is provided in the tables below. 2017 Research activity Table 2: Ethics approvals SMHS 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017Ethics Approval 92 Table 3: Governance approvals FSFHG RGH Total 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017Site Authorisations 142 13 155 Table 4: Closed projects SMHS 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2017Projects Closed 17* *An audit of expired and closed projects is planned for early 2018. 13 SMHS Research Report 2017Waiver of consent SMHS HREC granted 30 waivers of consent in 2017 as per table 5 below.

(Investigator initiated). Andrew MaioranaHeart patients taking part in exercise study While exercise has been shown to be good for you when you have coronary heart disease, researchers at Fiona Stanley hospital (FSH) want to find out which form of exercise is best for these patients. FSH Head of Exercise Physiology and principal investigator, Andrew Maiorana, said they want to find the most effective ways to engage coronary patients in exercise. \"Exercise is really good for heart disease. If we can determine the best way to maintain good overall health and fitness, then we can encourage our cardiac patients to get moving,\" Andrew said. \"We are comparing pool-based exercise, gym exercise and participants continuing their usual activity to compare the effects on fitness, strength, body composition, artery health, blood test results and brain blood flow,\" he said. Andrew said the study is recruiting patients over 18 years of age who have had a cardiac episode at least six months ago. \"We are recruiting people who have been diagnosed with coronary heart disease, with a previous heart attack, stent or coronary artery bypass graft surgery, who are willing to commit to a 12 week program,\" he said. 77 year old former patient, Herbert Auchli, joined the study following a heart scare almost three years ago. \"I thought I had really bad indigestion. After a trip to the health clinic and an ambulance to FSH, I ended up having three stents inserted into a blocked artery,\" he said. Herbert has always been interested in research, so he jumped at the opportunity and encourages others to do the same. \"Research is an important part of our society. I am doing something for the community by doing something for myself and am really enjoying the program so far,\" he said. The study is in collaboration with FSH, Curtin University, The University of Western Australia and Royal Perth Hospital and is funded by the National Heart Foundation and the Spinnaker Foundation. 25 SMHS Research Report 2017Herbert Auchli takes a break during his exercise program with Physiotherapist and Curtin University PhD student, Anna Scheer and FSH Head of Exercise Physiology and principal investigator, Andrew Maiorana. 26 SMHS Research Report 201727 SMHS Research Report 2017Cardiothoracic Surgery 1 3 Projects Title CPI An enhanced database module: A multicentre, retrospective cohort study of valve surgery registry patientsIan Gilfillan Publications Skiba R, Merry C.

Survival of Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Patients in the Modern Era in Australia and New Zealand . Heart Lung and Circulation. 2017:in press. 51 SMHS Research Report 2017In Focus International Lung Screen Trial (ILST). Dr Annette McWilliamsLandmark study to detect lung cancer early Fiona Stanley Hospital (FSH) is taking part in an international lung cancer screening study to determine the most effective methods for early lung cancer diagnosis. Lead Investigator and FSH Respiratory Physician Dr Annette McWilliams said lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths in Australia. \"A lot of work has been done in lung cancer screening in past 15 years to get to this point, we are now part of a landmark study,\" Dr McWilliams said. \"The use of low dose chest CT scans has been shown to save lives from lung cancer but we do not yet have a lung cancer screening program in Australia.\" The study is recruiting participants aged between 55 to 80 years of age who are current or former smokers to undertake a risk assessment, breathing test and, if eligible, a low-dose chest CT scan and then tracked for five years. Patients with suspicious lesions are seen in the FSH Fast Track Lung Cancer Clinic for management, diagnosis and treatment, and continue as part of the study. Dr McWilliams hopes this trial is the catalyst for change in how lung cancer is diagnosed in Australia to lead to better survival outcomes. \"Currently, the survival rates for lung cancer are only 15 per cent, as most patients have advanced, incurable disease at the time of diagnosis,\" Dr McWilliams said. \"Smoking cessation remains crucial but about 60 per cent of lung cancers in Australia occur in people who have already quit smoking or have never smoked. 52 SMHS Research Report 2017\"Lung cancer screening with low dose chest CT has been proven to reduce lung cancer deaths and save lives.\" Several countries including the USA and Japan have either implemented lung cancer screening or are evaluating implementation methods. This study, also underway in Canada and Hong Kong, will provide crucial information for implementation of lung cancer screening in Australia in partnership with Cancer Council NSW. The aim is to recruit 500 local participants at FSH, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital and Osborne Park Hospital.

Dr Lewis MarshallReducing the rates of HIV presentations in WA Reducing the number of HIV presentations by providing access to vital medication is Sexual Health Physician Dr Lewis Marshall's aim in a state-wide implementation research study. Dr Marshall is part-way through the study which has focused on creating strategies and disseminating a co-formulated pill of the medications Tenofovir and Emtricitabine. \"We know the medication works. We just need to get the logistics right and get men who have sex with other men onto the medication,\" Dr Marshall said. \"We ask suitable participants to take the medication once daily and then present for follow up every three months, this has been shown to reduce the risk of contracting HIV by more than 90 per cent.\" Dr Marshall said early indicators showed the strategy has been successful with a drop in HIV presentations. \"From what we can see so far, HIV rates in WA have dropped from 88 new cases in 2016 to 68 in 2017,\" he said. \"There is still no cure for HIV but there is very effective treatment to manage the condition and this is really having an effect on the community.\" The study is also looking at the impact of this medication on the rates of gonorrhoea, syphilis and chlamydia. \"By reducing the risk of contracting HIV, we need to determine the effect of increased sexually transmitted infections and anecdotally we are seeing a surge,\" Dr Marshall said. \"In having participants monitored every three months, we hope to catch any infections early, to treat them and reduce the spread of infection amongst the community.\" To date, Dr Marshall and his team at Fremantle Hospital's South Terrace Clinic have recruited 90 patients to the study, with the hope of getting to150 by the time recruitment finishes in September. 58 SMHS Research Report 2017Dr Marshall said he was passionate about undertaking research as maintaining best practice was crucial in providing the best patient care. \"Research is a critical function and must instruct everything we do to ensure we are continuously improving patient outcomes,\" he said. When the trial ends in April 2019, the drug will be available through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and patients will still be encouraged to attend sexual health clinics for three monthly monitoring. The study was initiated by the Department of Communicable Diseases control branch and has been coordinated by the Kirby Institute.

Dr Ed O'LoughlinResearch focus on patient outcomes Undertaking research to ensure better patient outcomes is what drives Fiona Stanley Hospital (FSH) Anaesthetist Dr Ed O'Loughlin. Dr O'Loughlin, who has has seven anaesthesia-related studies underway, said the style of perioperative research had changed over the years. \"Our focus in research has shifted over the past few years as we place more of an emphasis on what we can do to make a patient's health outcomes better not only now, but in the weeks, months and years following their stay in hospital,\" he said. Under Dr O'Loughlin's leadership as a principal investigator at FSH and on the National Health and Medical Research Council, the hospital is participating in a global, $4.6 million, 8880 participant trial called PADDI. \"We are looking at the effect of a very commonly used anti-nausea medication, Dexamethasone, and whether or not it contributes to patients getting infections after their surgery,\" Dr O'Loughlin said. \"Half of the patients are being given this medication post-surgery to decrease swelling and make them feel better, but we don't know if it is increasing the rates of infection, resulting in poorer outcomes. \"This study is a prime example of our change in research focus. A medication might make a patient feel better in the first 24 hours but make them worse a month to six months later.\" The impact of the work of the anaesthesia and pain research team can be felt not only by the individual patient, but also their family, the community and health service. \"We, the whole research team, focus on those things that matter to patients, which include getting them back home and moving, as well as reducing delirium and complications,\" Dr O'Loughlin said. \"Research is critically important for us to know whether our interventions are making a difference in the lives of patients. \"I am forever curious and enjoy challenging the status quo to find the best results for our patients.\" 62 SMHS Research Report 2017Anaesthetist and Raine Clinician Research Fellow Dr Ed O'Loughlin. 63 SMHS Research Report 2017Intensive Care 11 18 Projects Title CPI A multicentre survey of the sources of health information used by surrogate decision makers of patients admitted to the Intensive Care UnitEdward Litton A Multi-centre, Randomised, Single Blinded Clinical Trial Comparing Liberal vs Conservative Oxygen Therapy in Mechanically Ventilated Adults in the Intensive Care Unit (The ICU-ROX Trial)Edward Litton A survey of Post-Intensive Care Syndrome in Patients Discharged from Intensive Care Units in Western AustraliaRavikiran Sonawane ADRENAL Study - Adjunctive coRticosteroid trEatment iN criticaAlly ilL patients with septic shock.

Dale Edgar Listening to patients to improve outcomes Giving patients a voice and learning from their experiences is at the core of the latest research project by Senior Physiotherapist Dale Edgar. This study is exploring the patient journey to see how the system and clinicians can work to decrease the risk of complications and deliver better outcomes after general surgery. \"By speaking with our patients and understanding where the shortfalls are, it will assist with informing on potential interventions,\" Dale said. \"We hope by adding exercise intervention (prehabilitation), it will give us time with patients to not only do a work up in the gym, but provide tailored education and manage expectations.\" Dale has been a senior researcher and allied health professional in the State Adult Burns Unit for almost 20 years. He has published more than 80 articles and been involved in more than 100 research projects. Dale is using this experience to cross-pollinate and assist in making change across different specialities. \"I hope to take my learnings and understanding from my work in burns and propagate this across other areas,\" Dale said. \"Similar work has also been completed in cardiovascular and upper abdominal surgery. Pulling all of the knowledge from these fields together to make change in general surgery should have a significant impact. \"While there may be different risk profiles and areas of risk in each speciality, the one constant is that patients require a general anaesthetic which increases the risk of respiratory and circulatory complications. 80 SMHS Research Report 2017\"The assumption is that if we can reduce the risks of patients having an anaesthetic by assisting them to be fitter and stronger for surgery we hope to mitigate complications and improve overall outcomes.\" The study has commenced recruitment to four focus groups, a mix of pre and post-operative patients. Dale believes this interaction with patients will improve all aspects of their experience, make the patient journey as efficient as possible and give them the best chance of a good outcome. \"Understanding the power of the patient's voice is crucial for us to improve the patient journey and their quality of life after the experience,\" Dale said.

Jennifer Nicholas Understanding determinants of health Understanding how health literacy impacts people with type 1 diabetes in managing their condition is part of a study being undertaken at the Fiona Stanley Hospital Diabetes Clinic by The University of Western Australia PhD student and Nurse Practitioner Jennifer Nicholas. By looking at health literacy data, Jennifer's project aims to inform strategies which can be used to mitigate risk factors contributing to poorer diabetes health outcomes. \"The management of diabetes is complex and very unique to each person living with the condition,\" Jennifer said. \"We want to understand the relationship between health literacy, diabetes knowledge, contextual factors, psychological distress and coping styles, and how these may influence diabetes-related health outcomes. \"Healthcare professionals need to understand how to clearly identify individual barriers and then plan individual care accordingly. Understanding and having access to health information may be one of these barriers for patients.\" The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare has identified that approximately 60 per cent of Australians have less than adequate health literacy. \"There is little Australian data showing the association between health literacy, knowledge and psychological factors associated with the burdens that can influence health outcomes for adults with type 1 diabetes,\" Jennifer said. \"This study aims to fill a gap in knowledge and provide data to guide our health care practices, with the aim of more targeted and personalised diabetes self-management education to every individual.\" The study aims to recruit 100 participants. 100 SMHS Research Report 2017Nurse Practitioner Jennifer Nicholas. 101 SMHS Research Report 2017Corporate research Medical Education 2 3 Office of the Chief Executive 1 0 Projects Title CPI/PI Changes in intern awareness and knowledge of risks of ionising radiation exposure from common diagnostic imaging procedures after the introduction of a mandatory learning module.Updesh Dhillon 'Clinical handover' Education for young doctors at Fiona Stanley Hospital: evaluating the impact of video-based teaching on knowledge, confidence and practiceHeidi Waldron Exploring the perspectives of project staff, on patient involvement in healthcare projects, in Western Australian (WA) public hospitals and health services.Melanie Wright Publications Benwell N, Hird K, Thomas N, Furness E, Fear M, Sweetman G.

Dr Ravikiran Sonawane Learning to thrive after a patient survives Understanding the effect of surviving a stint in an intensive care unit (ICU) is the premise of a new study by Rockingham General Hospital ICU Consultant Dr Ravikiran Sonawane. Dr Sonawane said the number of patients leaving ICU alive has increased steadily over the years. \"Survival rates in ICUs have been improving with enhanced care. Our focus is now shifting to not only improving survival but also quality of life, so patients can resume their baseline quality of life again after a significant stay in hospital,\" he said. \"When patients leave ICU we are finding they have what we call 'post-intensive care syndrome' (PICS), where they suffer from physical weakness and mental affliction. \"These symptoms are serious and can last months and, in some cases, the rest of their lives. \"The effect of weakness has a huge impact on their day to day functioning and overall lifestyle. In addition to this, people can experience increased anxiety, nightmares, partial recollection and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms which can be difficult to overcome without support. \"In the older population we are finding these after effects can sometimes change patient's treatment decisions.\" The study will survey 100 patients throughout their first year of discharge from the ICU, at six and 12 month intervals, to analyse their emotional wellbeing and the community resources they may be using to aid their recovery. Dr Sonawane hopes the study will help raise issues to shape the future of ICU services and allow for ICUs to offer follow up outpatient clinics. \"If we can extend the scope of an ICU beyond survival and into discharge we hope to assist patients in achieving a holistic recovery,\" he said. \"By doing this research we can improve our practices and give patients the best chance at life.\" 108 SMHS Research Report 2017Rockingham General Hospital ICU Head of Department and Researcher Dr Ravikiran Sonawane. 109 SMHS Research Report 2017 Projects Mental Health CPI/PI A Mixed-Methods Investigation of Perceived Barriers and Enablers of Sport Participation for Young People Experiencing a First Episode Psychosis.Daniel Gucciardi Altitudes East-West: A randomised controlled trial of Moderated Online Social Therapy for carers of first episode psychosis clients in real world settingsYael Perry South Metropolitan Pregnancy and Emotional Wellbeing Study (SMPEWS)Megan Galbally Rheumatology CPI/PI Australian Rheumatology Association Database - A longitudinal study of the long-term effects of arthritis and its treatments in Australia (ARAD)Helen Keen Publications Harrison CA, Hauck Y, Ashby R.
