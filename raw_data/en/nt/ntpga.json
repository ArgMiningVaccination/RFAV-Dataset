Figure 2: Top U.S. COVID-19 Vaccine Supply Chain Suppliers Facilities. Pfizer and BioNTech Pfizer can integrate most of its manufacturing and distribution in the United States. The company, however, was part of operation warp speed for distribution ( [Slaoui & Hepburn, 2020](#ref-slaoui2020developing)). According to the company's yearly review, the company has ten manufacturing facilities and two distribution centers, as shown in Fig. [3](#fig:PfizerLocations) . ( [Inc., 2018](#ref-Pfizer2019)), However, only a handful of sites are directly involved in manufacturing its Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, as highlighted in Fig. [4](#fig:PfizerManufacturing) and Fig. [5](#fig:PfizerCovid). - St. Louis, Missouri plant - The process starts at this manufacturing plant in the DNA production and raw materials of their COVID-19 Vaccine. - Drug Formulation in Andover, Massachusetts or Germany facility - RNA messenger through DNA incubation with genetic building blocks takes place in the Andover facility for the U.S. market while international market is supplied by facilities located in Germany - Fast shipment to next facility in helicopters or jets at the beggining of the manufacturing process - Lipids production & other raw materials - U.K. Croda International - Formulation, Fill and Finish in Kalamazoo, Michigan - LNP production step in Kalamazoo is reported to be the bottleneck of the U.S. supply chain. \"Combining mRNA and lipids into lipid nanoparticles is the biggest hurdle in the manufacturing process\" ( [Lowe, 2021](#ref-Derek2021)) - Two production lines producing 600 vials/min - LNP production step in Kalamazoo is reported to be the bottleneck of the U.S. supply chain. \"Combining mRNA and lipids into lipid nanoparticles is the biggest hurdle in the manufacturing process\" ( Moderna Moderna is a U.S.-based pharmaceutical company founded in 2010 with primary headquarters located in Cambridge, MA, and specialized in the research and development of mRNA-based therapeutics. The company is part of Operation Warp Speed and backed by Venture Capital investments ( [Moderna, 2021](#ref-Moderna2021)); other takeaways about the company are shown in Fig. [6](#fig:ModernaProfile).

Each 0.5 mL dose of the Janssen COVID-19 Vaccine is formulated to contain 50 billion virus particles of the Ad26 vector encoding the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 Vaccination Landscape The World Health Organization (WHO) provides weekly bulletins with the status of COVID-19 Vaccine clinical trials in the world. The bulletin is updated twice per week and includes information from several data sources such as Pubmed ( [Canese & Weis, 2013](#ref-canese2013pubmed)), the ClinicalTrials.gov (ICTRP) ( [Organization, 2021](#ref-ICTRP)) and other researchers in industries with registered trials for clinical information ( [R&D Blue Print, 2021](#ref-whovaccines2021)). In addition, several news organizations and research teams have been reporting periodic updates and keeping track of changes, for instance, the New York Times ( [Carl Zimmer, 2021](#ref-nytVaccTracker)) and Bloomberg ( [Bloomberg, 2021](#ref-bloombergVacTracker)), to mention some examples of such efforts to inform the general public. According to the sources mentioned before, there are 73 vaccines being researched around the world in clinical trials on humans, 16 have reached the final stages of testing, known as Phase III. Of these, at least 182 pre-clinical vaccines are under active investigation in animals as of Feb. 23, 2021 Table 1 tbl.
