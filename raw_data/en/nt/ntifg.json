We aim to provide tailored programs you can personalise to your preferences.", "sitename": "Goddess Retreats", "date": "2021-10-18", "cleaned_text": "Cosmetic acupuncture works to reduce wrinkles, eliminating acne and scarring, buffing out fine lines and lifting sagging skin, as well as improving your skin colour and texture without use of any harsh chemicals. It works internally to optimize your health while simultaneously enhancing the natural appearance of your skin. It is a great natural alternative to treatments such as botox, chemical peels and face-lift surgeries. During the session, tiny and fine needles are inserted along specific points along the face, releasing energy and those amazing, feel-good endorphins. How? The petite needles stimulate blood flow and cellular re-growth, producing collagen and utilising your body's magnificent natural healing processes. Optional: Adding electroacupuncture (a form of acupuncture where a small electric current is passed between pairs of needles) in the Cosmetic Acupuncture treatment can give you even faster and better results. *This is included as an option in our [Wellness Goddess Retreat](https://www.goddessretreats.com/goddess-packages/wellness-retreat-bali-detox/) packages. This is also an individual option that can be added while on your retreat program for an additional fee. Subject to availability. "}
