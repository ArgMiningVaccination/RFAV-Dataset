It is said to have the effect of nourishing tonic and boosting immunity, and is also used as a Chinese herbal medicine. It is a fruit that is expected to have beneficial effects, especially for women, such as anemia and postpartum confinement. Since each grain is small and dry, I soak it in hot water for about 2 minutes, put it in yogurt, and eat it every breakfast. It is recommended to soak it in hot water as it will soften your body. Longan is a fruit tree native to South Asia and India. If you break the smooth 2-3 cm outer skin, you will find black seeds in the almost transparent jelly-like flesh, so it looks like a dragon's eye! It seems that the name came from. It is also known as a medicinal food in Chinese medicine, and is said to have a nourishing tonic, especially a blood-replenishing (blood-supplementing) effect. It is perfect for supplementing blood and recovering energy during menstruation, after childbirth, and after illness. This product is said to be dried longan flesh (longan meat in Chinese medicine). When the sweetness of the flesh itself dries, it is concentrated tightly and the sweetness is felt. Also, the characteristic of longan meat is the unique smoked incense, which I like very much. By the way, my partner has had asthma for 30 years, but when I have asthma, eating this longan meat seems to ease my asthma, so it is a regular medicine at home that I always have. "}
