It aims to measure the ability of cat owners to assess acute pain in cats using the FGS, compared with veterinarians' assessments, with participants asked to score facial images of 10 cats with different levels of pain resulting from natural conditions (surgery or disease). The research team is headed by WSAVA Global Pain Council members Drs Beatriz Monteiro and Paulo Steagall, who are working with veterinary student Netta Lee from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, on the project. The results will be published in an open-access peer reviewed scientific journal. Dr Beatriz Monteiro Member of the WSAVA Global Pain Council The study will help us to learn whether owners are able to tell if their cat is in pain by looking at their faces and using the Feline Grimace Scale. We would be grateful if WSAVA members would spread the word among their cat-owning clients and encourage them to complete the survey. We hope to increase pain awareness among owners. This might prompt them to take their cat to the veterinarian earlier if they are suspected to be in pain. The survey is open until May 15 and is available in both English and Spanish. It is anonymous and will take about 20 minutes to complete. It is open to anyone over 18, as long as they do not have veterinary training and they either own - or have owned - a cat. The study is being run in collaboration with International Cat Care and is supported by WSAVA Platinum Partner, Zoetis. The Facebook posts below can be used to promote the study. Links to the survey are also below. Thank you for your support and we will update WSAVA members on the results of the study when they are available. "}
