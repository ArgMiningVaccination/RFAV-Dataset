JYNNEOS is currently being used internationally to address mpox. For more information, refer to [CDC: Mpox Vaccination Basics](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/mpox/vaccines/index.html). Vaccine strategy Minnesota's vaccine strategy focuses on equity. To best reach people who are at highest risk for mpox, we are working with a wide range of clinics, tribal clinics, and clinics serving those experiencing homelessness. Providers are using the following strategies to vaccinate: - Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) Vaccinate people with a documented exposure to a person with mpox. - Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) Provide vaccine to people who are at high potential for exposure to mpox, or those at high risk for an occupational exposure. Currently, the vaccine is for people who do not have symptoms of mpox infection and are at risk of mpox disease, including: - Those exposed in the past 14 days to someone who has been diagnosed with mpox infection or someone who has not received test results back yet but has been told by their provider it is most likely a mpox infection. - Identify as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men (MSM), or transgender (including trans man, trans woman, or nonbinary or gender-nonconforming person). - Engage in sex work, or exchange sex for food, money, substances, shelter, etc. - Sexual partners of people with the above risks. - Other person deemed at high risk per clinical judgement or public health recommendation. Outreach and priority should be focused on people who are eligible by the above criteria and: - Living with HIV. - Immune-compromising condition (leukemia, lymphoma, generalized malignancy, solid organ transplantation, therapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites, radiation, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, high-dose corticosteroids, being a recipient with hematopoietic stem cell transplant <24 months post-transplant or 24 months but with graft-versus-host disease or disease relapse, or having autoimmune disease with immunodeficiency as a clinical component). - On or eligible for HIV PrEP. - Deemed at a higher risk for mpox infection per clinical judgement or public health recommendation (e.g., treated for a sexually transmitted infection [STI] in the last 6 months, people experiencing homelessness, incarcerated, or traveling to an area with community transmission of mpox cases). Vaccine access Many health care providers and community clinics across Minnesota have received vaccine or have access to it. If you are at highest risk and would like to get vaccinated, start by contacting your primary care provider. If you do not have a provider or your provider does not have vaccine, visit the [CDC: Mpox Vaccination Basics](https://mpoxvaxmap.org/view/) to search for Mpox Vaccine Locator tool for additional clinics that have reported on the vaccine locator site that they have vaccine available. Mpox vaccine administration Why is the mpox vaccine being given intradermally? The JYNNEOS vaccine can be given between the layers of the skin (intradermally) on the forearm, upper arm, or upper back for most people 18 years and older or into the fatty tissue of the upper arm (subcutaneously) for all ages it is recommended for. Giving JYNNEOS intradermally is preferred as it allows for more people to get vaccinated since it takes less vaccine than giving it subcutaneously. People can have the vaccine administered subcutaneously when they prefer to receive it this way. Are the side effects different if I get the mpox vaccine subcutaneously or intradermally? Common reactions were similar when receiving it either subcutaneously (e.g., in the fatty tissue of the upper arm) or intradermally (e.g., between the layers of the skin). However, redness, swelling, itching, thickening or discoloration of the skin where the vaccine was given was more common when given intradermally and could last several days or weeks. Am I protected after getting vaccinated? Your body will start to build protection in the days and weeks after your first vaccine dose, but it may take at least two weeks after receiving the second dose of JYNNEOS to get the most protection. Getting two doses of JYNNEOS vaccine by either the intradermal or subcutaneous route may reduce the severity of mpox symptoms and hospitalization. It is important to continue practicing prevention measures, even after vaccination. "}
