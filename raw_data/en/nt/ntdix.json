She was nowhere near as thorough and helpful as Dr. Tachdjian is and I never went back, despite knowing I needed follow ups. To note: this is the same doctor that others have started reviewing (in an attempt to steal my glory) under his name only. Same awesome allergist: [yelp.com/biz/raffi-tachd...](http://www.yelp.com/biz/raffi-tachdjian-md-santa-monica)8/23/2009Previous review LOVE my allergist. Made an appointment here after I had a random allergic reaction and wound up in the ER when I couldn't breathe. Figured I should get tested before I wound up dead in the gutter. I saw Raffi Tachdjian MD, who aside from being dreamy is a fantastic physician. During our first appointment he knew I didn't feel well overall, he did a mini-physical to make sure there was nothing major wrong with me. Above and beyond the call of duty. I'm feeling much better now, and I'm sure part of that is having my allergies under control. I had no idea I even had seasonal allergies. He listens, never rushes, and thoroughly explains everything. Plus, he's a humanitarian. He started a charity where he lights up the lives of sick babies with music.

I like to picture him strumming his banjo and saving the world from hay fever. Superhero Allergist. The staff working there is great. They're all friendly and organized, easy to work with. I tried getting allergy shots, but despite them making it as easy and fast as possible, I couldn't maintain visiting the doctor 2-3 times a week. So, now I have a list of things I'm allergic to. I have an Epi Pen in my purse in case I ever need to stab my thigh with an emergency supply of adrenaline. Feeling better. Not having a runny nose all the time definitely helps. - 4/28/2015 I have never been to such an efficient office! All of the staff were very courteous and had vibrant happy personalities. They educated me well on all the subjects I had concerns about and more. I only work in Santa Monica but will be a loyal patient after such a great experience. Special thank you to Dr. HO!! She is extremely professional and very well educated. Thank you to all of the wonderful staff for providing me with one of the best experiences I've ever had! - 8/15/2016 I got referred here by a neighbor a few years back. Recently I have started the allergy immunization process. I did the cluster process and now I'm in the maintenance stage. I noticed my allergies have gotten better. The process was very painful and time consuming, but if you suffer from major allergies it's a small price to pay. Dr. Gellar and Dr, ho are both super nice and the staff is amazingly nice and friendly. The staff made my time spent there a lot more entertaining. - 3/12/2015 It is always a great experience when I go see Dr. Gellar. Shanna who works at the front desk is always pleasant. I am usually in and out really quickly. Very rarely do I have to wait long which is nice because I have to take my lunch break to go. Normally other doctor offices have no regard for their patients time. I have been coming here for years and I will continue coming here :) - 7/8/2014 My experience with Dr Tachdjian was rewarding one. I had a non allergic and uncommon cause to my hives and Dr Tachdjian impressively reached a diagnosis and sent me in the right direction. In addition to having a very personable manner, he is accessible and very attentive to my concerns. I wish I could be as complimentary of the front desk staff. In particular Shanna, desperately needs to remember that she is a part of a service industry. As a receptionist it is imperative to be professional, polite, and welcoming. She falls far short in all these areas. In no way would I entertain hiring her as one my of my employees let alone staffing her at the front desk. Fives stars for Dr Tachdjian. Zero for lack of front desk common courtesy. - 12/14/2012 My doctor is Raffi Tachdjian. He is a young guy (around 40), very warm, very bright and very charming. Most importantly, he is a great diagnostic physician. I had been suffering from sinus problems for over twenty years. I saw many different types of doctors but no one seemed to find an effective long term cure for my problem. Dr. T put me on IGG infusion therapy. I have been giving myself the infusions for over a year now. This is the healthiest year of my adult life and I have Raffi to thank. So, happy holidays, Dr. T. You have truly changed my life!
