Integrative medicine practitioners partner with you to navigate which approaches, from both conventional as well as complementary practices, are best suited for you in your journey to wellness. Here are the practices I've found to have the most profound results for my patients. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE Mind-Body Support Mind-body encompasses many different ways of supporting the healing journey both physically and mentally. I focus on gentle movement through Tai Chi and Qigong, restoring and optimizing proper sleep function, meditation and breathwork. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE nutrition What you eat matters. Simple changes to your day to day food choices can have a huge impact on your health and your ability to respond to stress. I can work with you to make sure you get the nutrition your body needs to heal. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE acupuncture Acupuncture is supported by a wealth of research to provide relief for a wide range of conditions like chemo-therapy associated nausea or fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, dental pain and chronic stress. I offer auricular (ear) acupuncture and am happy to talk with you about finding local licensed acupuncturists who can offer more extensive protocols. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE herbal medicine The plant world has some potent medicines but finding high quality, evidence-based remedies can be hard. I offer curated recommendations from trusted 'gold-standard' suppliers ensuring they are appropriate to be taken alongside any existing medication you may be taking. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE Council Council is a practice of deep listening and authentic speaking that has parallels in wisdom-traditions all over the world. Integrative Medicine seeks to acknowledge and care for the whole person, including each person's physical/emotional/mental and spiritual self as well as their health in relation to others, to community and to the world. I find Council to be an essential tool in the practice of integrative medicine.
