Chinese herbal medicine is focused on treating and resolving the symptoms you are experiencing. In order to do this most effectively, the practitioner will perform a diagnostic intake that paints a picture of you as a whole person. Your practitioner will examine your tongue, feel your pulse, ask about your chief symptoms, and also ask constitutional questions such as body temperature, quality of sleep and nature of digestion. The goal is to provide an herbal formula that will help your body regulate itself in a more healthful manner. There are hundreds of herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine that can be combined into thousands of formulas to treat a very large number of symptoms and conditions. If you take pharmaceutical medications, our licensed practitioner, Dr. Rose, will cross-check the specific herbs in your formula through a drug-herb interaction database prior to dispensing your medicine, to ensure that there will not be any adverse effects. Chinese herbal medicine can help treat things such as acute onset of the common cold, stress, insomnia, digestive issues, chronic illness, and autoimmune issues. Herbs are dispensed in the form of granules (which are a concentrated powder mixed with water). Our herbal medicine supplier is SunTen, a Taiwan based company which has industry leading standards for testing for purity, pesticides and heavy metals of their herbal products. "}
