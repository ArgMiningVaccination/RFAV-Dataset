Tylenol After Shots and Autism?? My dd just had her 4 month shots today. She started screaming tonight in pain, so we gave her Tylenol as recommended by her pediatrician. The same happened at her 2 month shots. Upon googling after, I find this legitimate study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044872/](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5044872/) It states proof that Tylenol after the MMR shot is definitely linked to autism. I also found other studies against its use. Now I know she did not get the MMR shot, but I'm still kinda freaking out. Anyone else experience this?

My LO has paracetamol after his vaccinations and I am sure he will be just fine not worried at all. I recommend not googling these sorts of things. One study is not fact. There is no link between autism and shots. Not the MMR, not tylenol afterwards, nothing. Also: This study is a review of previously collected data. It's not a randomized controlled trial which has much more research validity. This just says that Tylenol in general is linked to autism. Also their study size was 200 kids. So I wouldn't call this a legitimate study. I thought it was 155... maybe I missed. 200 somewhere... tiny tiny group O good lord here we go again HAHAHA Is this a troll post? No, I'm not a troll, promise. I've posted on here before. :) I just kinda had a freak out after going to Dr Google. The responses make me feel better. I just have a general distrust of pharmaceutical companies (partially based on friends' experiences as drug reps). I'm following the vaccination protocol, though... I don't want to open that can of worms here! I'm sorry for calling you a troll! Vacccine posts always make me so wary! totally understood. No worries! one small study does not mean tylenol is definitely linked to autism. I call shenanigans.
