We are back to talk about education and empowerment, how to empower you to take control of this pandemic that's occurring... Certainly we would ask that you conti nue with your basic immunity, that's your vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc and a probiotic. In addition, there are some Theresa Fontenot December 10, 2020 Page 5 great formulas out there. This one is probably my favorite and I was only able to get I think 40 of these and they are backordered thr ough t he whole nation until May. ImmuCore is a multidimensional immune support system that kind of gives you lots of different products. T here is C in there, and D, and Niacin, and Z inc...but this also includes like some mushroom extracts and mushrooms are huge right now if you are looking into following anything on social media they are talking lots about these mushrooms and mushroom extracts that can really help....We also have something called TH1 s upport and I love TH1 support. When we think of our immunity, we call it TH1 which is innate , or our natural body's ability to fight infection....We want to increase TH1 , our innate immunity, and this is how to do that. ... [W]hen we do increase our innate immunity sometimes we can start to create thes e things called cytokines . They are an inflammatory reaction to help fight so what we do know is as we are trying to improve our immunity we also want to kind of fight a little bit of that inflammatory effect... so we can do that... I often will add Meriva whic h is an optimized curcumin form to it. And a nother way to kind of help bring down some of that inflammation is by doing Inflavanoids . This has curcumin in it . It also has quercetin and several other things that can kind of help bring down some of that inflammation . In the days to come we will talk about protocols if you happen to be getting ill. It doesn't have to be just from the Corona virus, it can be any cold or virus that is coming on and Essential Defense ... is a way to do that. It is a combination of different Chinese herbal products that you actually take rapidly . I use it for a couple different protocols. One of them is when someone is starting to get sick... I will probably make a suggestion of combining that with some thing called Andrographis and that is a product that I have in the other room but we often do together. So what we know is that there is lots of information out there and there is probably a lot of questions. I have been researching the majority of it and again what I want to do is empower and educate, so give us a call and let's see if we can answer any of those questions.

B ut the thing I want to really do is calm everybody's nerves. We have the ability th rough functional medicine to give you some information to make you feel more empowered that you can take some control over some immunity, how can we boost our immunity and there is some good information on how we can decrease symptoms of viruses , and this being a virus that we know at this point has no way to really t reat it, then what we need to do is real ly work on our immunity. And I have been, what I would honestly say is day trading on supplements over the past few days , it has been insane. You will find out since there is not much that is available at this time through the pharmaceutical industry , people are depending more on our innate, or our own immunity so I have done plenty of research on both basic and advance d protocols for your immunity and we are going to be here to offer that to you and do it in a very safe way. \" [March 24, 2020 Facebook post at https://www.facebook.com/ReNewMedSpa/ ] In a March 19 , 2020 Facebook post you state : \"A message from our fearless leader on Covid 19!\" This post includes a video in which you state : \"...We want to be a resource to empower and educate the community on what we can do to boost our immunity, and to make it through this difficult time that is going on.
