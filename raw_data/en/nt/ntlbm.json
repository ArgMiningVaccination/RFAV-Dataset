NATUROPATHY Natruopathy is a complimentary therapy which uses holistic principles to treat the underlying cause and the whole patient and develop preventative measures to reduce recurrence. Naturopathic treatment is specific to each individual, it aims to uncover the underlying stressors that may be dimishing vitality, causing disease, illness and emotional disturbance, preventing you from achieving your full potential. The role of the naturopathic clinician is to facilitate this process through teaching and providing a range of holistic medicines. The healing power of nature is a principle that underlies all natural medicine. It is the belief that the body has the ability to heal itself, given the proper support. Its basic laws looks at the: - the education of the patient to empower them as to the laws of healthy eating - supporting the body's own systems - the use of natrual and non-toxic therapies - the patient needs to take responsibility as to their own health. The Naturopath draws on many different modalities to encourage and administer change and strength. These include herbal medicine, nutrition dietary lifestyle changes and nutritional supplementations, flower essence therapy along with various other modalities as well as diagnostic techniques including iris analysis, tongue and nail sign analysis. AROMATHERAPY Aromatherapy is a holistic treatment, it is caring, hands on therapy which seeks to induce relaxation, to increase energy, to reduce the effects of stress and to restore lost balance to mind, body and soul. Essential oils used in Aromatherapy are pure aromatic essences which are extracted or steam distilled from flowers, leaves, foliage and roots of herbs, shrubs and trees. Each oil has a unique medicinal property and all essential oils are highly antiseptic. Their quality depends on many factors- the country where the plant has been gathered, the quality of the crop depending on climatic changes, the way they are collected and stored. There are good years for essential oils as there are for wines, and it is somewhat dependant on the way they are obtained, matured and preserved. When diluted with a massage or carrier oil and applied externally they are very powerful penetrative oils. Absorbed into the bloodstream they can relax, refresh and restore. One of the most advantageous aspects of using essential oils medicinally is that they enter and leave the body without leaving toxins behind and without unpleasant side effects. Unlike chemical drugs, essential oils do not, as far as is know, remain in the body. Essential oils are therefore therapeutic physically and emotionally and have many different uses from relaxing a baby after a bath; repelling insects and treating their stings; relieving muscle strain; aches and pains; air deoderiser; excellent for all types of stress; establishing a romantic atmosphere, and much more. Different essential oils are prescribed or administered to individuals for specific ailments or needs as are herbal tinctures. REFLEXOLOGY Reflexology is a form of healing that can be traced bact at least 5000 years to Egypt, the first evidence deriving from the tombs of the physicians as Saqhara. Modern Reflexology was introduced to America in the early 1900's by Dr. William Fitzgerald, an ear, nose and throat specialist who learned a form of reflex therapy while studying in Europe. His early studies resulted in what is known as zone therapy, which shows 10 vertical zones through the body corresponding to the 10 fingers and toes. When continuous pressure is applied to these zones, it proved to produce an analgesic effect along the entire zone. Later it was found that an intermittent pressure had a stimulating effect on the organs of the body, assisting them to function more effectively. Reflexology works as a form of communication between the practitioner and the client to assist the client to come back to a state of balance and harmony at every level. By stimulating the reflex points on the feet, changes can be activated at the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual levels simultaneously. The effects of Reflexology include reduced stress and tension, improved circulation, feeling of peace and wellbeing, improved vitality, deep relaxation, shifts in emotional blocks, improved skin tone and texture, detoxification, improve immune system function, lowered blood pressure and improved sleep. Generally a session will take from 45-90 minutes depending on your needs. Experience shows that generally 4-6 sessions once a week are required to achieve good results. To assist you to achieve your desired results additional sessions may be necessary but this is best discussed during a consultation. Where acute conditions exist it may be necessary to carry out Reflexology sessions more frequently. Reflexology is a natural means of healing, it treats the person in a holistic way, it stimulates a persons own healing energy, it is non intrusive and is compatible with all other healing modalities. People at any age with any ailment can benefit from these therapies.
