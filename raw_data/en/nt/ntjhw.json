Donnie received his herbal training through [Sequoia College](https://www.cos.edu/en-us) and is a professional member of the [American Herbalists Guild](https://www.americanherbalistsguild.com/). He was trained as a clinical nutritionist through the National Institute of Nutritional Education and holds certification through the [National Association of Nutrition Professionals](https://nanp.org/). Donnie is also professed as a Secular Franciscan (SFO), which equips him with the breadth and wisdom to touch on the spiritual aspects of healing. Donnie has authored two books: [Herbal Medicine, Healing and Cancer](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/herbal-medicine-healing-cancer) [Adaptogens in Medical Herbalism: Elite Herbs and Natural Compounds for Mastering Stress, Aging and Chronic Illness.](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/medical-herbalism) In addition, he has been involved in authoring and co-authoring dozens of articles that have appeared in major industry publications and national journals. On the education side, each year Donnie Yance gives several lectures across the USA at major hospitals and conferences for both patients and health care providers, as well as making radio and podcast appearances. After decades of extensive research and clinical practice, Donnie developed a comprehensive approach to healing called the [Eclectic Triphasic Medical System (ETMS)](https://www.donnieyance.com/etms-model/). Now also practiced as Mederi Medicine/Mederi Care, ETMS consists of a holistic diagnostic and therapeutic methodology rooted in American Eclectic herbal tradition, constitutional energetics, and contemporary clinical nutrition\u2014continuously updated and honed with the latest scientific research at the molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. In 2011, the [Centre for Natural Healing](https://naturahealthproducts.com/centre-for-natural-healing) (now [Mederi Center](https://medericenter.org/)), where Donnie Yance has conducted his successful clinical practice since 1992, merged with the [Mederi Foundation](http://www.mederifoundation.org/), a 501(c)(3) organization established by Yance in 2005. ETMS is the care model employed by the [Mederi Center's](https://medericenter.org/) clinical practice team and the Foundation's professional educational training and clinical research programs. Over the past two decades, Donnie Yance has built a library of well-established, world-class research on the medicinal value and multifaceted interactions of over one hundred botanicals and their key constituents, with major emphasis in the area of Oncology. This incredible collection will be available to health care professionals through the [Mederi Academy](https://medericenter.org/practitioners/education/education-overview.html). Donnie Yance is also the founder and formulator of [Natura Health Products](https://naturahealthproducts.com/), for which he created a unique line of therapeutic-grade botanical and nutritional supplements. The current Natura portfolio consists of over forty formulations derived from botanical and nutritional agents acquired from around the world. These products have made a significant contribution to his tangible success in improving the health of his patients, specifically by providing therapeutic amounts of key ingredients that would otherwise be unattainable anywhere in the world.
