We've harnessed the natural properties of Coconut Oil which has its origins in Ayurvedic Medicine Our passion and practice are our own, but they are inspired by these ancient principles. Ayurveda (also called Ayurvedic medicine) is one of the world's oldest whole-body healing systems. Ayurvedic medicine originated in India and has been evolving for the past 5,000 years. It's considered to be a Vedic practice. The Vedic sciences - Yoga being one of them - are primarily focused on the development of the full human potential, both mental and spiritual. It's a lot to take in, but fear not! There are simple points of entry for the modern seeker of Ayurvedic wisdom, and Dr. Ginger'sis one component you can start within the journey toward achieving a balanced, healthy body. Ayurvedic teachings are centered on achieving a body's healthy balance. This balance is affected by food, environment, relationships, and emotional health. This emphasis on the balance of overall lifestyle distinguishes Ayurvedic medicine from modern medicine. Modern medical practice centers around a transactional relationship between symptoms and treatment. If you have a headache you take an aspirin, right? The Ayurveda would prefer to explore the imbalance at the root of the symptoms. The key to understanding those symptoms is the doshas. The doshas are three elemental substances, Vata, Pitta, and Kapha, that make up the essence of a person. The balance of the three is unique for each person. When the balance within a person is tipped, symptoms will manifest. Practitioners of Ayurveda seek to understand the balance of the individual and then identify the cause of the imbalance that is leading to their symptoms. While there is not a full scientific review of the entire body of Ayurvedic practice, individual elements have shown scientific value. Oil pulling is an ancient proven practice for oral hygiene. It involves swishing oil in the mouth \"pulling\" the oil between the teeth. It is believed that the practice is over 3,000 years old. And oil pulling has definite positive results for improved oral care. Bacteria in the mouth are all single-cell organisms. These organisms are covered in a membrane composed of fats. When these fats come in contact with oil during an oil pulling session, they adhere to one another and come loose in the oil. Dr. Ginger's Coconut Oil Mouthwash takes this practice and maximizes its effectiveness by adding two modern coefficients - Xylitol and Zinc Chloride - to our key ingredient which is Coconut Oil. These powerful ingredients magnify the benefits, taking the oil pulling practice to a whole new level. Dr. Ginger's also tastes great, motivating you to get the most out of your rinsing sessions without the unpleasant oily flavor or texture. Human nature being what it is, we all know we'll use something more frequently if it's a pleasant & fun experience! So if you are a seeker of Ayurvedic practice, or just someone looking for a more natural oral care solution, we invite you to add Dr. Ginger's line of natural products to your routine for a more balanced, "}
