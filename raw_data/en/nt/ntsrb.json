You can still get COVID-19 after vaccination, but your symptoms are likely to be much less severe. Vaccination helps you avoid hospitalization and death. What we know - Vaccinations can prevent most COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths. - COVID-19 vaccines are effective against many [variants](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-Variants.aspx)of the virus. - People with weak immune systems are more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms, even if vaccinated. What we're still learning - How long COVID-19 vaccine protection lasts Once you're vaccinated Vaccination makes it safer to return to the activities you love. Continue to keep everyone safer by staying aware of local public health recommendations. Read more from CDPH: Vaccines and variants Vaccination has proven very effective against COVID-19 variants. The best thing we can do to protect ourselves from getting very sick from COVID-19 is to stay up-to-date with vaccines. As of April 18, 2023, the FDA has authorized the use of the updated Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for all doses given to anyone 6 months of age and older. What you need to know People who are already vaccinated - Most people should get one dose of the updated vaccine. - People 65 years and older who have received one dose of the updated vaccine may receive one additional dose, at least four months after their initial dose. - People with weak immune systems who have already received the updated vaccine may receive one additional dose, at least two months after their initial dose, with a doctor's approval. For individuals with weak immune systems who are between 6 months and 4 years of age, their eligibility for additional doses will depend on the vaccine they previously received. - Children 6 months through 5 years of age who have already received one, two, or three doses of the original vaccine should receive one to two doses of the updated vaccine, with a doctor's approval. The number of doses recommended will depend on which vaccine they have already received and the number of doses received. People who are unvaccinated - Most adults who are unvaccinated should get one dose of the updated vaccine. Multiple doses are not required. - Children aged 6 months through 5 years who are currently unvaccinated may receive either: - A two-dose series of the Moderna vaccine (for children 6 months through 5 years of age) OR - A three-dose series of the Pfizer vaccine (for children 6 months through 4 years of age) - Children who are 5 years of age may receive two doses of the Moderna vaccine or one dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Variants See [variants now present in California](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-Variants.aspx). More info about COVID-19 variants from CDPH: Additional doses Additional doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine are available for those 65 years and older or those who have weak immune systems. This includes people who: - Get active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood - Got an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Got a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Have moderate or severe immune deficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) - Have advanced or untreated HIV infection - Are taking high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that suppress the immune response Children aged 6 months and older with these conditions may be eligible for an additional dose of the vaccine. Talk to your doctor to see if getting an additional dose is right for you. If you meet these criteria, you can book your shot at [My Turn](https://myturn.ca.gov/). See [questions and answers about additional doses](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/ThirdVaccineDoseQandA.aspx). Digital vaccine record You can now get a digital copy of your vaccination record. This is called the [Digital Vaccine Record](https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/) (DVR). It's available to you if: - You got vaccinated in California, and - Your information matches what is recorded in the state's immunization systems. [Learn more about your digital vaccine record](/dcvr). Side effects After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some mild side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. More serious side effects rarely happen. Mild side effects Common mild side effects include: - Soreness, redness, or swelling where you got the shot - Feeling tired, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea Side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects. Rare but serious side effects Myocarditis and pericarditis Some young people have developed inflammation of heart muscle or membrane after getting Pfizer, Moderna, or Novavax. This is very rare. The CDC says the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the risks. Some people may consider waiting 8 weeks between doses of Pfizer, Moderna, or Novavax. More time between doses may reduce the risk of myocarditis. Males aged 12-39 may benefit the most from waiting 8 weeks. Reporting side effects of vaccines If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to: [VAERS](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html)(Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) When to call the doctor In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider if: - The redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours - Your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you have a severe reaction, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. Learn more about [COVID-19 vaccines and rare severe allergic reactions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html). Read more in the CDC's [Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html). Questions and answers Getting vaccinated How many COVID-19 vaccine doses do I need, and how far apart should I get them? For everyone 6 and older who doesn't have a weak immune system: Pfizer and Moderna: - One dose of the updated vaccine For Novavax: - Two doses 3-8 weeks apart, followed by an additional dose People who have weak immune systems may need additional doses at different times. See the [CDC's vaccine recommendations for those with weak immune systems](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html). Read [Additional doses](#Booster-shots-and-additional-doses) to see if you are eligible. Will I need an additional dose? People are best protected when they stay up to date on their COVID-19 vaccination. Everyone 6 months and older is eligible for at least one updated vaccine dose. Those at higher risk \u2014 including people 65 years and older, and people 6 years and older with weak immune systems \u2014 are also eligible for an additional dose. The CDC recommends additional doses of Pfizer or Moderna for those with a weak immune system. This includes those who: - Get active cancer treatment for tumors or cancers of the blood - Got an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Got a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system - Have moderate or severe immune deficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome) - Have advanced or untreated HIV infection - Get active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that suppress immune response Children 6 months to 5 years old with these conditions who got the Moderna vaccine may be eligible for an additional dose of Moderna. Additional doses should be the same vaccine as the initial dose. Talk to your doctor to see if getting an additional dose is right for you. If you meet these criteria, you can book your dose at [My Turn](https://myturn.ca.gov/). Can I mix and match COVID-19 vaccines from different manufacturers? Yes, people ages 6 years and older may mix and match after completing their first vaccination series. In the United States, that means: - Two shots of the original Pfizer vaccine, or one dose of the updated vaccine; - Two shots of the original Moderna vaccine, or one dose of the updated vaccine; - Two shots of the Novavax vaccine; or - One shot of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (this vaccine is no longer authorized). Then, people 6 and older may receive either updated booster. In some cases, people 18 and older who are unable or unwilling to get the updated booster can get the Novavax booster. Some people may prefer the vaccine they got before, and others may prefer to get a different booster. CDC recommendations now allow for this type of mix-and-match dosing for booster doses. Mixing vaccines is not allowed for children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years. Children in this age group who receive the Moderna vaccine can get the Moderna booster, and children in this age group who receive the Pfizer vaccine can get the Pfizer booster. What if I was vaccinated outside the United States? Can I get a vaccination or additional dose here? Yes. Here's what the CDC recommends: - If you were vaccinated outside the U.S. with a vaccine approved or authorized by the FDA, you can get an additional dose. You must follow [U.S. eligibility and timing schedules](https://myturn.ca.gov/en_US/eligibility.html). - If you got one or both doses of a World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listed (EUL) vaccine, you can get: - A second dose, or - Additional dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. You must follow [U.S. eligibility and timing schedules](https://myturn.ca.gov/en_US/eligibility.html). - If you got a COVID-19 vaccine that's not WHO-EUL, you should start over. Get an FDA-authorized vaccine and follow its [timing schedule](https://myturn.ca.gov/en_US/eligibility.html). Schedule your vaccination at [My Turn](https://myturn.ca.gov/). How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost? Nothing. COVID-19 vaccinations are free. Do I need to be a California resident to get a COVID-19 vaccine? No. Vaccine eligibility is based on age. Residency or immigration status does not matter and will not be checked at your vaccine appointment. How do I cancel or reschedule my vaccine appointment through My Turn? If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, you can do so on the [Manage your appointments](https://myturn.ca.gov/manage) page. You will be asked to confirm your appointment with: - Your appointment confirmation number, and - Either your cell phone number or your email address. I've already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine? Yes. The CDC recommends that people who have already had COVID-19 get a COVID-19 vaccine. We do not know how long your protection lasts from getting infected again after you recover. People who get vaccinated after infection have additional protection against COVID-19. One [study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7032e1.htm?s_cid=mm7032e1_e&ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM63289&ACSTrackingLabel=MMWR%20Early%20Release%20-%20Vol.%2070%2C%20August%206%2C%202021&deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM63289) showed that unvaccinated people who already had COVID-19 are more than twice as likely as vaccinated people to get it again. Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 while I am currently sick with COVID-19? No. Wait until you have recovered and have met the [criteria for ending isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html). This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 between their first and second dose. Will COVID-19 vaccine sites be accessible? Yes. All vaccine clinics in California are required to meet ADA requirements. How do I get a COVID-19 vaccination at home? If you are medically fragile or have mobility issues, you may be eligible for an in-home vaccination. Check with your doctor or [local health department](/get-local-information/#County-websites). You may also call [211](tel:211). LA County residents (except in Long Beach and Pasadena) can make an [In-Home COVID-19 Vaccination Request](https://lacpublichealth.sjc1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_79t9X8nww90Tdfo). If you need help or have questions, call 833-540-0473. This line is open every day from 8:00AM-8:30PM. As of August 31, 2022, [My Turn](https://myturn.ca.gov/) no longer offers in-home vaccination. How do I get transportation to a vaccine site? If you do not have a way to get to a vaccination site, you can receive free transportation through: [My Turn](https://myturn.ca.gov), or - By calling the state's COVID-19 hotline at [1-833-422-4255](tel:1-833-422-4255).

When are you up-to-date with your COVID-19 vaccines? Everyone aged 6 years and older is considered to be up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccinations when they receive 1 updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine recommendations range from 1 to 3 doses depending on age and brand. Talk to your doctor to find out how many doses are right for you or your child, or [visit My Turn to see your vaccine eligibility](https://myturn.ca.gov/en_US/eligibility.html). Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19? No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on viral tests. If your body develops an immune response, you may test positive on antibody tests. This shows that you may have protection against the virus. How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine? California law strictly limits how personal information can be shared. The state prevents individuals being identified in shared data. Read more at CDPH's [California Data Use Agreement and Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/California-Data-Use-Agreement.aspx). Should I keep my COVID-19 vaccination record card? Yes. Keep your vaccination record card in a safe place to prevent loss or damage. The [Digital Vaccine Record](https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/) (DVR) portal gives you a digital copy of this record. If you've lost your paper card, print out your digital record. You can use it at any place where you would show your paper card. Read CDPH's [Vaccine Record Guidelines & Standards](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Vaccine-Record-Guidelines-Standards.aspx) for complete details. If I get a booster shot or additional dose, will it show on my digital vaccine record? They will not automatically show on your digital vaccine record. You will need to go to the [Digital Vaccine Record](https://myvaccinerecord.cdph.ca.gov/) portal to get a new QR code. Wait 14 days for your new dose to show up in the California Immunization Registry before you try to get a new QR code. Vaccination for children Do providers need parental consent before administering a COVID-19 vaccine to a minor? Yes. Before vaccinating a minor, vaccine providers must get consent from a: - Parent, - Legal guardian, or - Other adults having legal custody. There are some exceptions: [Emancipated minors](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=FAM\u00a7ionNum=7050.)do not need the consent of a parent or guardian to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. - Providers may accept written consent. It must be from the parent or legal guardian of an unaccompanied minor. This consent must verify the parent/guardian has received the [Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet](https://www.fda.gov/media/167212/download)or the [Moderna EUA Fact Sheet](https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download). - Phone or video consent is acceptable. The parent/guardian must confirm that they received the [Pfizer EUA Fact Sheet](https://www.fda.gov/media/167212/download)or the [Moderna EUA Fact Sheet](https://www.fda.gov/media/144638/download). Reading the fact sheet to the parent/guardian is an option. Families should check with their vaccine provider on acceptable forms of consent. See CDPH's [Vaccine Minor Consent Guidance](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID-19-Vaccine-Minor-Consent-Guidance.aspx) for more details. Why should I vaccinate my child? Cases of COVID-19 infection in children are increasing. We must get young people vaccinated to prevent more hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccinations protect children from the most severe outcomes of COVID-19. These can include MIS-C, hospitalization, and death. Vaccinations can also shrink the pool of people vulnerable to COVID-19. By getting children 6 months and up vaccinated, families can be safer as we get back to doing the things we love. My child has had reactions to other vaccines. Should they still get the vaccine? Yes, unless they have had life-threatening allergic reactions to components of COVID-19 vaccines. Allergic reactions to these vaccines are rare. Talk to your child's doctor before vaccination if they've had: - Severe allergies - Flu vaccination reactions Can children who have pre-existing conditions like asthma get vaccinated? Yes. Children can still receive the COVID-19 vaccine even if they have pre-existing health conditions. Talk to your doctor or clinic about your child's specific conditions before scheduling their vaccines. Why did it take longer for the COVID-19 vaccine to be approved for youth? For safety reasons, new vaccines and medicines are typically first given to adults, who have fully developed their immune systems. When they are found to be safe and effective, they are given to children. Clinical trials prove COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. They result in a strong antibody response in children who receive them. Vaccinations for employees I'm an employer and want to help my employees get vaccinated. How do I do that? The [Employer Vaccination Toolkit](https://saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov/employer-vaccination-toolkit/) provides all the information you need to: - Partner with local providers for offsite vaccination events - Request a worksite mobile clinic - Help employees find and book vaccination appointments - Share and promote resources that support employees in getting vaccinated Can an employer require COVID-19 vaccination for all employees entering a workplace? Yes, if certain requirements are met. Under the ADA, an employer may insist all employees to meet a standard that is: - Job-related, and - Meets a business need This could include a safety-related standard requiring COVID-19 vaccination. If an employee cannot be vaccinated because of a disability, the employer may not require them to. The exception to that is if the employee's non-compliance poses a threat to their health or safety or that of others in the workplace. Read more: Vaccine limitations If I get a COVID-19 vaccine, will I still need a flu shot? Yes. The COVID-19 vaccine does not provide protection against flu. Are there certain populations who should not get a COVID-19 vaccine? What about people with allergies? The [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html) that: - If you had a severe reaction to an mRNA vaccine or its ingredients: - Do not get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. - If you had a reaction to the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but your doctor considered it not severe: - You likely can receive another dose of the same vaccine. Ask your doctor if you're unsure. - If you are allergic to PEG: - Do not get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. - If you are allergic to polysorbate: - Do not get the Novavax vaccine. - Ask your doctor if you can get the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. People with medical conditions can get vaccinated if they are not allergic to vaccine ingredients. Learn more about [vaccination considerations for people with underlying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html). To learn about the ingredients in authorized COVID-19 vaccines, [see the CDC's overview of COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/overview-COVID-19-vaccines.html#mrna). If I'm pregnant or breastfeeding, should I get the COVID-19 vaccine? Yes. The CDC strongly recommends that you get vaccinated if: - You're pregnant, - You could be pregnant, or - You're breastfeeding. If you get COVID-19 while you are pregnant, you are more likely to get severely ill. You also increase your risk of pregnancy complications and premature birth. The vaccines are safe and beneficial for you and your baby. Talk to your doctor if you have questions about getting a COVID-19 vaccine. For more information, read: How long should I wait to get the vaccine after I've had COVID-19? The [CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fpfizer%2Fclinical-considerations.html) that if you tested positive, had only mild symptoms, and were not treated, you should: - Wait until your symptoms are improving, and - You meet [criteria to stop isolation](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/duration-isolation.html)before getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Consider waiting 90 days to get the vaccine if you recently recovered from COVID-19. Waiting is not required. Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as another vaccine? Yes, you can get a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines at the same visit. This includes the flu shot and routine vaccinations for kids. Learn more about [getting more than one kind of vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html#Coadministration). Vaccine choices Will I have a choice between the various COVID-19 vaccines? Yes. Both [My Turn](https://myturn.ca.gov/) and [Vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/search/) allow you to search for vaccines by manufacturer. Read CDPH's [Choosing the COVID-19 Vaccine That is Right for You](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Which-Vaccine-is-Right-for-Me-Fact-Sheet.pdf). Are the COVID-19 vaccines FDA-approved? The FDA can allow using vaccines before full approval. This is called an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). It lets us respond quickly to emergency situations like a pandemic. - The Pfizer vaccine has an EUA for use in anyone aged 6 months and up - The Moderna vaccine has an EUA for use in anyone aged 6 months and up - The Novavax vaccine has an EUA for use in anyone aged 12 and up - The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was authorized for use for those 18 years and older from February 2021 through June 2023 How can I convince my family and friends to take a COVID-19 vaccine? Talking with family and friends about the benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine can be hard. Try to listen without judgment and identify the root of their concerns. Things to remember to help open the discussion include: - Listen to questions with empathy - Ask open-ended questions to explore concerns - Ask permission to share information - Help them find their own reason to get vaccinated - Help make their vaccination happen "}
