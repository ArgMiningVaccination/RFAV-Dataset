On the morning of Match Day (see article), our faculty announced prizes and honors earned by senior class members and then further distracted them by having them pose for their class picture. With the countdown to the noon distribution of match envelopes, we effectively launched our senior class. They did exceptionally well, match-ing in competitive residencies from Boston to California and from Michigan to T exas. The next major event is Alumni Weekend. Boston University School of Medicine is at an exciting point in our evolution, and I look forward to speaking with many of you about our efforts to advance excellence across our missions of education, research, patient care, and community service. Our faculty is committed to teaching the next generation of scientists, physicians, physician assistants, and other health care professionals. We completed the integration of the second- year curriculum a few years ago and Dr. Douglas Hughes, our associate provost of academic affairs, has now launched efforts to integrate our first year's medical course of study. We also are experimenting with providing leadership training (negoti- ating skills, conflict management, and even spreadsheets and accounting) for our medical students. Managing a clinical ser - vice or a laboratory research team requires skills we weren't taught in medical school. Y ou may have noticed that we have changed the name of this publication from Campus and Alumni News to Boston University Medicine to best reflect our mission and our message. As you will see in this first issue of Boston University Medicine, through the generosity of our alumni and friends, we continue to invest in student scholarship aid, faculty recruitment, and classroom and laboratory renovations to enhance our students' experience on campus. Y ou will read about the transformation of an empty lot behind the student residence into a recreation area with basket - ball and volleyball courts, a field for soccer, Frisbee, or football, and even nine raised bed planters for growing vegetables. Our faculty is engaged in an incredible breadth of discov - ery and innovation, from basic curiosity-driven science, to the study of clinical interventions, to studies of neighborhoods and populations to transform health care. We remain deeply com-mitted to Boston and our community.Discovering underlying pat - terns in disease mechanisms is central to developing better treatment and prevention. Our faculty has developed out - standing clinical and research reputations in a number of seemingly diverse diseases (Alzheimer's disease, amy - loidosis, prion infections, and sports-related chronic traumatic encephalopathy), each of which is characterized by the accu- mulation of abnormally folded proteins. We cover some of the faculty doing this research in the current issue and on the cover. As evidenced by their research and teaching, outstanding faculty and our ability to recruit and retain them are key to the School's success. Endowed professorships help make this pos-sible. The Department of Dermatology celebrated the instal- lation of two accomplished physicians, Drs. Vincent Falanga and Michael Lichtman, as the Barbara A. Gilchrest Professor of Dermatology and the Peter E. Pochi Assistant Professor of Dermatology. The two chairs honor two of our most distin- guished dermatology faculty, Drs. Gilchrest and Pochi, and support a senior investigator and launch a promising assistant professor, respectively. We congratulate all four faculty mem- bers and the department's chair, Dr. Rhoda Alani. Also in this issue we pay tribute to one of the School's most renowned faculty members, Alan Peters, who recently retired. Dr. Peters is a legend in the field of neuroanatomy as well as on the Medical Campus. Last fall we celebrated his long and productive career and we wish him well in his retirement. Last winter we lost two of our most respected colleagues, Kenneth Edelin and Joel Alpert. Dr. Edelin headed our Department of Ob-Gyn for many years and also served as associate dean for minority affairs. A 42-year member of the BUSM community, Dr. Alpert chaired the Department of Pediatrics as well and served as assistant dean for student affairs. We will miss both of them.

Realizing that stu-dents needed recreation space immediately, Antman approached John Barton, Medical Campus executive director of facilities, with the idea of transforming the site into a green space that could be used for sports and other activities. Working together, they devel-oped a plan and a budget. Antman says that Barton was the one who dubbed the space the \"Field of Dreams.\"field of dreams Space for recreation and gardening offers students welcome respite By l eslie f riday CYDNEY S COTT J ust over a year ago, Dean Karen Antman, MD, was strolling past the newly opened Medical Student Residence on Albany Street when she spotted stu-dents tossing a football in the small courtyard abut - ting the building. The tight space called for some creative, and potentially dangerous, catches. \"They kept careening into the benches and rose bushes,\" says Antman, who also serves as Medical Campus provost. \"Clearly they needed a field.\" Claire Wang (MED'16) examines the green beans growing in raised beds on the Field of Dreams.

The field now boasts an NBA-sized basket - ball court, a sand volleyball court, and a grass field for sports like soccer, Ultimate Frisbee, and football as well as nine raised vegetable beds, where students can help themselves to fresh produce. The Field of Dreams offers an essential respite to the stress of medical school. \"No matter how wonderful a student you were Without the field, most students would have to go to a gym, the Charles River Campus, or the South End to play sports. \"It definitely allows students to have access to their hobbies.\" PEPPERS PHOTO COURTESY OF ANGELA JACKSONone of the amenities of the f ield of dreams behind the Medical student r esidence on Albany street is the nBA-sized basketball court, where students can play a pickup game. www.twitter.com/ BuMedicine Red bell peppers were among the many vegetables planted last summer. before, medical school is difficult,\" says Angela Jackson, a BUSM associate professor of medicine and associate dean for student affairs. \"It's more demanding, more anxiety-producing, and just being able to balance life is impossible.\" And while extracurricular activities are available for BUSM students, Jackson says, \"there is something about just getting your hands in the dirt and eating the product of your work.\" On a recent autumn afternoon, Barton swipes his BU identification card to enter the gated field. Any BU student with a valid ID has access to the area. So far, Barton says, the University has had no problems with trespassing or vandalism, despite the high-traffic area.There's still some work to do on the field. Barton points to the volleyball court, which he'd like to expand in the coming months, and the grass that's been reluctant to take hold. Still, the field is already popular. On a recent weeknight, students were playing a pickup basketball game on the new court. And the garden, although tired and wilting after a long growing season, produced a nice crop of eggplants, kale, brussels sprouts, tomatoes, and a wide variety of herbs. Claire Wang (MED'16) comes to the gar - den occasionally to pick bell peppers and chilies to mix into stir-fries, and she sees people playing basketball nearly every night. Without the field, most students would have to go to a gym, the Charles River Campus, or the South End to play sports, she says. \"It definitely allows students to have access to their hobbies.\" Jackson recruited students via email to participate in the garden. Those interested compiled a wish list of fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Some even solicited suggestions from parents knowledgeable about garden-ing. After pruning their choices, the students presented a list to Jackson, Antman, and Barton, and Barton's team planted them in early summer. \"This year was trial and error,\" says Barton, who envisions planting fruit trees and blue-berry bushes in the future. Although the field is enhancing the quality of life for current BUSM students, it will even-tually be replaced by two buildings that will provide critically needed additional housing. The first will eliminate the raised beds and sand volleyball court; the second will occupy the remainder of the field. \"Given the fundraising required for either building,\" Antman says, \"I believe we will have most of the field for some time.\" This story first appeared in BU T oday. n4 Boston University School of Medicine PHOTO BY FRANK CURRANCAMPUS news two renowned dermatologists and longtime BUSM Department of Dermatology faculty members were honored during a professor - ship installation ceremony held on the Medi- cal Campus on November 8, 2013. Former Dermatology Chair Barbara Gilchrest, MD, and former Herbert Mescon Professor of Der - matology Peter Pochi (MED'55) were lauded for their seminal contributions to the field and recognized with named professorships. \"Our recent professorship installations allowed the Department of Dermatology at Boston University School of Medicine to celebrate its illustrious past, outstanding present, and bright vision for the future,\" says Rhoda Alani, MD, Herbert Mescon Professor and Chair of the Department of Dermatology. \"This was truly a celebration of the dedica- tion to excellence that epitomizes Boston University.\" Barbara Gilchrest served as BUSM profes- sor and chair of dermatology for 23 years, growing the department from 1.5 members to more than 40 full-time clinicians and researchers. An internationally recognized expert in skin aging, pigmentation, and other effects of light on normal and diseased skin, she has authored or co-authored more than of dermatology and pathology and head of the Dermatopathology Section. \"Under her leadership, four endowed professorships, one career development award, and two inter - national fellowships were established in our department. In addition, she was able to con- vince BU leadership to give dermatology its own building. How many departments in the country have their own building?\" The first occupant of the Barbara A. Gil- chrest Professorship of Dermatology is Vin-cent Falanga, MD, vice chair for research and program director for the Department of Der - matology and research professor of biochem- istry. \"Dr. Vincent Falanga was appointed as the Barbara Gilchrest Professor of Derma- tology, connecting two world-renowned lead-ers in skin disease research and two former department chairs through this new profes- sorship,\" Alani notes. \"Both Drs. Falanga and Gilchrest are widely viewed as true visionar - ies in their fields of translation wound healing research, and photobiology, skin pigmenta-tion, and photoaging, respectively. It is truly amazing to have two such legendary figures in dermatology at our institution and to honor them in such a fashion.\" A Harvard Medical School graduate, Falanga completed his internship and resi-dency in internal medicine at the University of Miami Jackson Memorial Hospital, a dermatology residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and a dermatopathology fel- lowship at Roger Williams Medical Center. He has been a BUSM faculty member for 15 years, also serving as assistant dean of clinical and faculty affairs and director of the BUSM Ambulatory Medical Clerkship at Roger Wil-liams Medical Center. A specialist in wound healing, Falanga was the first to successfully test and use autolo-gous cultured bone marrow-derived mesen- chymal stem cells in human chronic wounds and the first to use a human recombinant growth factor in nonhealing wounds. He led the research showing the effectiveness of living bioengineered skin in venous ulcers, which became the first-ever FDA-approved bioengineered skin for wounds.

Pochi Assis- tant Professor of Dermatology,\" says Alani. \"A longtime member of the BU Dermatology faculty, Dr. Pochi is currently professor emeri- tus at BU, where he had an illustrious career in academic dermatology and dermatologic research. His most notable accomplishments were in critical discoveries related to the roles of hormones and retinoids in the develop- ment of acne in patients. His discoveries were critical to the development of retinoid and hormonal therapies for the treatment of recal- citrant acne and his previous contributions were recognized by his appointment as the first Herbert Mescon Professor of Dermatol- ogy. Dr. Pochi retired from practice in 1991; however, he continued to make significant contributions to our institution through his generous donation of time and resources to the School of Medicine, for which he received its Distinguished Alumnus Award.\" A 1955 BUSM graduate, Pochi completed his internship and dermatology residency at BUSM. The author of more than 150 publica- tions, he was associate editor of the Journal of Investigative Dermatology and on the editorial boards of the Archives of Dermatology and the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatol- ogy. He was elected to the board of directors of the American Academy of Dermatology and was vice president of the Society for Investi- gative Dermatology. Pochi also has received the BUSM Frederick Jackson Faculty Award for Excellence in Teaching. Clinical Associate Professor of Dermatol- ogy Michael Rosenbaum (MED'78), recalls that when he was a dermatology resident, \"Dr. Pochi showed me by example, great wis-dom, compulsive tenacity in clinical problem solving, and total respect for each individual patient's unique life situation and personality. In addition to being the heart and soul of BU dermatology for decades, Dr. Pochi has been a tireless and loyal supporter and builder of the School of Medicine as a whole.\" \"In naming Dr. Lichtman\u2014a new faculty member in dermatology\u2014as the Peter E. Pochi Professor, we link the department's illustrious past to its brightest and best hope for the future,\" adds Alani. \"Dr. Lichtman will be pursuing a translational research program dedicated to the use of stem cells to treat patients with recalcitrant wounds. He will work collaboratively with Dr. Falanga in these efforts, thus bringing the entire celebration full circle. We were delighted to honor these tremendous lead- ers in dermatology and to celebrate their accomplishments and contributions to our specialty in such a meaningful way.\" Lichtman graduated from the University of Washington School of Medicine and com-pleted his internal medicine residency at New York Presbyterian-Columbia Univer - sity Medical Center and dermatology train-ing at the University of Texas Southwestern. Simultaneously, he was a postdoctoral fellow at Brigham and Women's Hospital, where he served as clinical director of the Angiogenesis and Wound Healing Cen- ter. His research focus is on the interface between immunology and stem cell biology to improve treatment of complex wounds. \"This event celebrates four careers, all active within the School of Medicine,\" says Dean Karen Antman, MD. \"Drs.

The Association of American Medical Colleges estimates that the United States will face a shortage of 91,500 doctors by 2020, up from the 62,900 fore- cast for 2015. The reasons for the shortage? An aging baby boomer generation that will require increasing medi- cal resources and the health insurance coverage to some 32 million currently uninsured Americans made possible by the Affordable Care Act by 2019. Physician assistants are licensed to practice medicine as part of a team that includes physicians. Along with nurse practitioners, they have become a growing part of medical prac- tices, largely because the bill for their services is less than that for physicians. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the number of PA jobs is expected to grow by 39 percent between 2008 (74,800) and 2018 (nearly 104,000). \"The United States needs a larger health professional workforce to care for aging baby boomers, and the demand for midlevel medical providers is increasing rapidly,\" says Dean Karen Antman, MD. \"The cur - rently available PA programs are turning down very qualified can-didates for lack of slots.\" Like their medical school counterparts, physician assis-tant students enrolled in the new BU program will learn medical sciences, clinical sci- ences, and clinical skills. The 28-month curriculum, divided into seven semesters, will con- sist of 12 months of traditional lectures and seminar ses-sions, followed by 16 months of hands-on clinical educa- tion in hospitals and clinics. PA students will also be required to submit a thesis proposal. Physician assistants are educated as generalists, says Mary L. Warner, MMSc, PA-C, a BUSM assistant professor of medicine and program direc- tor of the Physician Assistant Program. \"Unlike physicians, physician assistants change specialties at least three times over the course of their career,\" Warner says. \"The most com- mon way PAs learn to practice in new specialties is the appren-tice model, with on-the-job training by their supervising physicians.\" While PAs are not required to do residencies after earning their degree, short-term residency programs in special-ties like obstetrics are available. Physician assistants per - form many of the same tasks as doctors. Among their responsi- bilities are performing physical exams, ordering lab tests and diagnosing illnesses, prescrib- ing medications and develop- ing treatment plans for patients, and\u2014when working in surgical settings\u2014assisting in surgery. First launched in 1965 at Duke University, the physi-cian assistant profession was initially intended to address the primary care shortage in rural and underserved areas. The BU degree program is designed to educate PAs who will care for a diverse population of patients in a variety of health care settings. BU's PA Program offers several innovations not found at other schools. Students will benefit from a flipped class- room, where professors assign video lectures and online read-ing to be completed at home, with classroom time reserved for problem solving and answer - ing questions. The anatomy lab, says Warner, will offer a full dissection lab, unusual for PA programs, and a physiology lab, also not widely available at other programs, as well as a strong research curriculum. \"In our partnerships with Boston Medical Center and the VA Boston Healthcare System,\" she says, \"the clinical education will focus on learning to care for patients from vulnerable populations.\" More than 1,000 people have applied for the 28 slots in the inaugural class, which Warner attributes to the short - age of primary care provid- ers and the strong projected growth prospects for the profession\u2014as well as BUSM's national reputation.

Thirty-seven percent of the class is entering primary care residencies in internal medicine, family medicine, and pediatrics. Eighteen graduates will stay on the Medical Campus training at Boston Medical Center (BMC) and two graduates are in the combined BMC/Boston Children's Hospital pediatrics program. Surgical residencies increased this year to nine percent of the class from three percent in 2013, and emergency medicine continues to be an area of particular interest with seven percent of the class matching in this specialty. \"Y ou are now ours and we love having you as alumni,\" Jean Ramsey, MD, associate dean for alumni affairs, said to the class. \"We will work with you to help keep you in contact and keep your class together.\" nCAMPUS news for a Match d ay video\u2014go.bu.edu/bumc/matchdaySpring 2014 | www.bumc.bu.edu 9AssociATe deAn for Md , MpH (SPH'86, MED'92), has been appointed associate dean for Continuing Medical Education (CME), stepping up from his previous position as assistant dean.

By Mary HopkinS Spring 2014 | www.bumc.bu.edu 11 PHOTO: C ONOR O THEISPOT .COM12 Boston University School of Medicine 12 Boston University School of Medicinecover s Tory l MISFOLDED PROTEINS Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, with five million Americans currently afflicted. It costs the nation $203 billion a year, an amount expected to increase to $1.2 trillion by 2050. Parkinson's disease (PD) afflicts as many as one million people, cost - ing approximately $25 billion in treatment, disability, and lost income from work. While amyotrophic lateral sclero- sis (ALS), prion diseases, and the various amyloidoses are rarer, the course of these degenerative diseases still has much to teach us. n What they and other devastating and costly diseases such as cancer and diabetes have in com-mon is that there is a growing understanding of the role that misfolded proteins plays in their occurrence.Humans are perfect examples of bio- logical self-assembly, and proteins are the building blocks of this formation. They make us who we are. They are the engines of vital functions such as growing and differentiating cells, catalyzing metabo- lism, stimulating immune responses, and building muscle. They function inside and outside of cells carrying signals between them or protecting them. Proteins are chains of amino acids whose sequences are determined by our genes. What ordains a protein's function is how the amino acid chain folds into a three-dimensional structure. A properly folded protein is able to carry out its intended function. BUSM researchers are studying how this process goes awry, leading to the mis-folding and aggregation of proteins that then accumulate in tissues, resulting in a variety of pathological conditions. Teams of basic science and clinical investigators focus on broadening our understanding of this biochemical malfunction, creating a knowledge base for developing thera- peutics to prevent or treat a variety of degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, ALS, or amyloidosis. \"Cells have normal mechanisms to cope with misfolded proteins,\" says David Harris, MD, PhD, professor and chair of biochemistry. \"Perhaps one- third of the proteins that a cell makes misfold, but there are adaptive mecha- nisms that cells employ to degrade the misfolded proteins or to refold them in a proper way.\" Harris explains that sometimes those adaptive mechanisms are overwhelmed and misfolded proteins start accumulat- ing in cells either inside the cell or outside of it, inhibiting the normal function of the cell or becoming toxic to it. Protein misfolding can be caused by genetic muta- tions and environmental influences. Age is a common predisposing factor in that as cells age, they may not be as capable of dealing with the stresses that cause pro-teins to misfold. \"Some of the most common degenera- tive diseases like Alzheimer's or the rarer ones like prion diseases, both of which I study, are diseases that result from mis- folding of proteins in the central nervous system,\" he says. \"This has therapeutic consequences since, if these diseases Spring 2014 | www.bumc.bu.edu 13 share a common underlying mechanism, then the compounds used to treat the diseases can be used for more than one disease. Or, at least some of the strategies used to treat one disease may be appli- cable to others.\" Harris has been studying prion dis- eases\u2014which are unusual due to their infectiousness\u2014for 20 years. \"The whole prion field has attracted the attention of scientists for a long time because of the nature of the infectious agent,\" says Harris. \"With bacteria and viruses we understand how they propagate and grow, but the infectious compound that causes prion diseases is not a bacterium or a virus. It is a naked protein molecule that is actually an altered version of a normal protein that sits on the surface of cells and has a normal function in the body. Dur - ing the course of infection, the normal protein is continuously converted into a form with an abnormal shape in a self- perpetuating process akin to ice crystal formation.\" Harris researches how this abnormal protein damages neurons and what forms of it are the most pathogenic. Although prion diseases are rare, the prion protein exists throughout nature. \"There is evidence that other neurode-generative diseases like Alzheimer's that are not infectious propagate through the central nervous system by a prion-like or self-templating mechanism,\" he says. \"The to misfold, thereby producing a self-perpetuating effect. This doesn't mean that Alzheimer's disease can be transmitted from one person to another, but it does mean that the abnormal proteins that aggregate in the brain can spread along neuroanatomical pathways in a mechanism that is similar to what prions do.\" Plaques, the abnormal aggre-gation of misfolded proteins that build up between nerve cells in the brain, are made of the A\u00df peptide. This buildup is believed to inhibit signaling between cells, result- ing in memory loss and the other intellec- tual and physical declines associated with Alzheimer's disease. Benjamin Wolozin, MD, PhD, profes- sor of pharmacology and neurology who \" Cells have normal mechanisms to cope with misfolded proteins.

This process is not random aggregation; it is controlled and reversible. Once the stress goes away, the stress granules disperse and protein synthesis returns to normal. So, that means that an intracellular function we thought was unchangeable is totally changeable.\" BenJAMin Wolozin, MD, PhD, professor of pharmacology and neurologystudies Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and ALS, realized a different model for looking at abnormal protein activity in neurodegen- erative diseases. \"What I am working on in one sense fits in with what everyone else is doing, but in another sense sets out an entirely new paradigm for understanding what is going on,\" Wolozin says. \"Proteins allow you to be yourself. What happens when you are injured? Your body recognizes the problem and adapts by temporarily shift- ing the kinds of proteins it makes from the specialized proteins that give rise to the amazing variety of biological activi- ties occurring in normal body function, to proteins to deal with the injury. This shift in the types of proteins produced is accomplished by a class of proteins termed RNA-binding proteins. These RNA-binding proteins normally reside in the nucleus, which in response to stress flood out into the cytoplasm, where they bind up RNA, forming RNA-protein com- plexes that are termed stress granules. \"The essential point of the process is that stress granules form based on the same type of protein aggregation that occurs in disease. This process is not random aggregation; it is controlled and reversible. Once the stress goes away, the stress granules disperse and protein syn- thesis returns to normal. This means that an intracellular function we thought was unchangeable is totally changeable.\" According to Wolozin, the misfold- ing and aggregation is in equilibrium. Normally, the aggregation of proteins to form stress granules rapidly reverses after the stress is removed, but with chronic disease, whether caused by genetic muta- tions as in ALS or with Alzheimer's, the dispersal part of the process, for different reasons, does not occur. \"What happens in Alzheimer's is a pathological protein, tau, mis-localizes and accumulates,\" says Wolozin. \"In its benign state, tau actu- ally helps axons extend. Under stress it redistributes, in part to stimulate stress granule formation. The RNA-binding pro- teins bind with the misfolded tau protein, forming stress granules in the neurons. We have shown that presence of tau in neurons is okay, and transient coupling with RNA-binding proteins to form stress cover s Tory l MISFOLDED PROTEINSSpring 2014 | www.bumc.bu.edu 15 CONOR DOHERTY\" When we look at the brains of patients who died of Alzheimer's disease, we can observe under the microscope two hallmarks of the disease\u2014plaques made of the protein A\u00df peptide and tangles made of the protein called tau. As a result of misfolding, these proteins aggregate and precipitate in the brain, and when they precipitate in the brain they become toxic.\" cArMelA ABrAhAM, PhD, professor of biochemistrygranules is also good, but chronic coupling gives you disease. \"When we look at one neurodegenera- tive disease after another it is all the same story,\" Wolozin adds. \"There is a common pathway. You normally sequester the RNA-binding proteins into stress granules for a short period of time, and then they disperse. However, if you bang your head a lot, as in sports-related concussions, or when there is a genetic mutation or a chronic disease like diabetes that reduces blood flow to the brain, you have chronic stress to the brain that causes these pro- tein aggregates to form, persist, and get bigger; these persistent, pathological stress granules disrupt nerve function. If they don't disaggregate, pathology and disease result. We are working on devel-oping methods to reverse the growth of stress granules, and in fact have identified a nontoxic compound that reverses a type of pathological stress granule (TDP-43) found in ALS.\" Wolozin's discovery of a single system of protein aggregation for an array of neu-rodegenerative diseases has important implications for developing therapeu-tics for these conditions. \"The idea that the body needs protein aggregation and there is one system built around this that chronic disease and aging hijack, causing dysfunction, opens up new avenues for basic science and translational research discovery.\" Carmela Abraham, PhD, professor of biochemistry, and members of her labora-tory conduct both basic science and trans- lational research; the former to determine the function of certain proteins in the brain and the latter to produce com- pounds that can be developed as drugs to treat Alzheimer's and other neurodegen-erative diseases. \"When we look at the brains of patients who died of Alzheimer's disease, we can observe under the microscope two hall- marks of the disease\u2014plaques made of the protein A\u00df peptide and tangles made of the protein called tau,\" says Abraham. \"As a result of misfolding, these proteins aggre- gate and precipitate in the brain, and when they precipitate in the brain they become toxic.\" Her lab uses high throughput screens to identify molecules that inhibit cover s Tory l MISFOLDED PROTEINS Clockwise from top: NIA AD Pathology:Pathological pathways in Alzheimer's disease.

Additionally, Klotho is reduced in all cancers. \"We don't study cancer, however, if we find molecules that are effective in increasing Klotho, we can look to produce drugs that may be effective in cancer treatment and prevention as well as in neurodegenerative disease,\" she notes. \"We will do this in collaboration with cancer researchers as we focus on what we know best, neuro- science.\" Amyloidosis is a term for diseases that have the extracellular deposition of insoluble fibrillar proteins in tissues and organs in common. Amyloids are protein aggre-gates created from misfolding of proteins and are associ- ated with numerous diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, type 2 diabetes, prion diseases, and amyloidoses caused by a plethora of different proteins. For more than 50 years, the BU Amy - loidosis Center has been a world leader in the research and treatment of systemic types of amyloidosis in conjunction with Boston Medical Center, which has 600- 700 amyloidosis patient visits each year. In addition, as an accredited diagnostic laboratory, the center receives samples from all over the world. The most common form of amyloidosis in the US is AL or primary amyloidosis, which is an acquired plasma cell disorder where amy - loid fibrils made up of immunoglobulin light chain proteins build up in organs of the body. Symptoms can occur in any organ of the body and include heart failure, protein in the urine or kidney failure, enlarged liver, neuropathy, or enlarged tongue. Secondary, or AA amyloidosis, is caused by a chronic infection or an inflammatory disease such as tubercu-losis, osteomyelitis, rheumatoid arthri-tis, familial Mediterranean fever, or inflammatory bowel disease. Infection or inflammation causes elevation of an acute phase protein, SAA, a portion of which deposits as amyloid fibrils. AA amyloidosis usually begins as disease in the kidneys, but other organs can also be affected. Medical or surgical treatment of the underlying chronic infection or inflammatory disease can slow down or stop the progression of this type of amy - loid. A second clinical trial to evaluate a new treatment with a targeted inhibitor molecule, Kiacta, has just begun. There are several types of inher - ited amyloidoses, the most common of which is caused by a mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene that produces abnormal transthyretin protein. The abnormal TTR protein deposits as amy - loid fibrils. Symptoms of disease are usually neuropathy and cardiomyopathy and occur in mid-to late-life; untreated A\u00df peptide from forming. \"We are work - ing to develop compounds that prevent the formation of A\u00df peptide that clogs the brains of people with Alzheimer's.\" Abraham is also examining the role of the anti-aging protein Klotho in normal aging and disease. Her projects focus on identifying Klotho receptors in the brain and defining the signaling pathways by which Klotho exerts its protective effects on neurons and oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells. She is also study - ing Klotho's transcriptional regulation and has identified compounds to thera- peutically exploit these protective effects. \"We found that Klotho expression is considerably decreased in the aged brains of monkeys, rats, and mice,\" she says. \"It is even more reduced in Alzheimer's. The idea is to find out why it is reduced and how to bring it back to levels found at younger ages. In animal models, a higher level of Klotho resulted in healthier mice and an increased life span of up to 30 percent. This suggests to us Klotho is a protective protein that is good for all of us to have.\" Klotho circulates in the blood and cere- bral spinal fluid and binds to an unknown receptor that Abraham is trying to find. \"It initiates some biochemical pathways in the cell that make the cell protected from all sorts of insults,\" she explains. \"One of its protective properties is against oxidative stress, which is correlated to misfolded proteins.\" The Klotho research entailed high throughput screening of some 150,000 molecules to identify those that elevate Klotho to the levels determined to be pro-tective. Abraham's research with animal models has found that genetically engi- neered mice with Alzheimer's who also have higher levels of Klotho do not have all of the symptoms of the disease, such as learning and memory deficits. Her group also found that Klotho helps repair myelin, the insulating material around neuronal axons that allows for cell-to-cell communication. This is an impor - tant discovery for the potential treatment of multiple sclerosis in which an autoim-mune attack destroys the myelin. Abraham recently published a paper on genetic mutations that change the DNA of Klotho in some people, which has an effect on health and life span. cover s Tory l MISFOLDED PROTEINS Stress granules highlight novel molecular pathology in the Alzheimer's brain.

Treatment traditionally has been liver transplantation. In collaboration with George Murphy, PhD, of the BU Center for Regenerative Medicine and assistant professor of medicine, it has been possible to recapitulate this multi- organ disease. \"George used the IPSC (induced pluripotent stem cell) technol-ogy to take cells derived from patients to make stem cells in the lab to generate cells similar to the patient's liver cells that produce the misfolded proteins,\" explains David Seldin, MD, PhD, profes- sor of medicine and microbiology and director of the Amyloidosis Center. \"He also was able to generate target tissue cells, neuronal and heart cells.\" In a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Associa-tion ( JAMA) in December, led by John Berk, MD, associate professor of medi- cine at BUSM and clinical director of the Amyloidosis Center, researchers dem-onstrated that diflunisal, a generic anti- inflammatory drug, successfully reduced neurological decline and preserved the quality of life in patients with familial ATTR. Diflunisal is an inexpensive and safe medication marketed over the past 40 years for arthritis and pain. \"The proteins of origin for these degenerative diseases are very differ - ent, and the function or sequence of an antibody light chain or A-beta or TTR or prion protein doesn't seem to be very similar, but the amyloid fibrils and struc- tures they form are identical under the electron microscope, so there is some-thing similar in the pathologic structure that the precursor proteins assume,\" says Seldin. \"In addition, the mechanisms of tissue damage are probably similar; that is an active area of research.\" Seldin stresses the importance of mis- folded protein research. \"You can view this body of research as the key to aging. If we could prevent proteins from misfold-ing in the brain, people might not lose their memory and develop dementia. In the rest of the body, we might keep organs functioning normally longer than they now do. Understanding and correcting misfolded proteins could be the key to helping people to live better and longer.\" n20 Boston University School of Medicinen BUsM Awarded $3M nih Grant to study link between obesity and Breast cancer in African American Women Gerald V.

According to the authors, not only does SNAP make life much better for children and families, it also saves society money. Unfortunately, they also point out that despite convincing evidence of the beneficial effects of SNAP on child health, legislators have targeted SNAP for cuts as they struggle to address the federal bud-get, lagging economy, and the US Farm Bill. \"SNAP acts as a vaccine against food insecurity and hunger,\" said lead author Deborah Frank, MD, director of BMC's Grow Clinic for Children and founder and principal investigator of Children's HealthWatch. Food insecurity is the measure of a household's ability to get enough health-ful food in socially acceptable ways so all of its members can live active, healthy lives. \"Our research consortium, Children's HealthWatch, has for more than a decade accumulated data on the impacts of food insecurity and interventions to decrease food insecurity among low- income babies and young children,\" Frank explained. She and her colleagues found that the youngest Americans and their families are at highest risk of food insecurity. \"Infants and young children in the first three years of life\u2014the most critical period for the growth of the body and brain\u2014are the most physiologically vulnerable to lasting ill effects of food insecurity on health and learn-ing.

If one of these risk factors clearly leads to PD, the risk factors could enable earlier detection of PD and open new ave-nues in the quest for therapies that could slow or stop disease progression.

Enrollment in the initial study is complete, with over 600 participants. BUSM and BMC have been part of PPMI for three years and are expected to begin enrollment for the new, pre-motor arm of the study immediately. \"Understanding risk factors for Parkinson's disease could help to identify therapies that may prevent the onset of motor symptoms in future generations of PD patients,\" said Principal Investigator Samuel Frank, MD. \"We are proud to participate in this innovative research and will look to the local community to continue to volun-teer for this key study.\" Volunteers can easily get involved in this research by being one of 10,000 individuals to complete a brief online survey about their sense of smell.

Based in Pondicherry, India, the joint program will establish cohorts of TB patients and their household con-tacts (people who live in the same household) who have been exposed to the disease. This will allow the research-ers to determine the impact of co-morbidities\u2014such as smoking, alcoholism, worm infections, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition\u2014on the risk of developing TB and patient response to treatment. \"India accounts for 30 percent of the global burden of TB and is one of the countries with the highest burden of the disease,\" said Jerrold Ellner, MD, professor of medi- cine at BUSM, chief of the section of infectious diseases at BMC, and US principal investigator. \"This study will identify new diagnostic biomarkers that will help deter - mine who, among heavily exposed persons, is at greatest risk of contracting the disease and targets for interven-tion,\" he added.

Binge drinking is a common and risky pattern of alco- hol consumption that is responsible for more than half of the 80,000 alcohol-attributable deaths that occur each year in the United States. \"If alcohol policies were a newly discovered gene, pill, or vaccine, we'd be investing billions of dollars to bring them to market,\" said Tim Naimi, MD, MPH, senior author of the study, and associate professor of medicine at BUSM and attending physician at BMC. While previous research demonstrates that individual alcohol policies can reduce risky drinking and alcohol-related harms, this is the first study to characterize the is the most important and effective public health program we have for reducing the health impacts of food insecu-rity,\" added Frank, who is also professor of child health and well-being at BUSM. According to the authors, there is strong evidence of the beneficial effects of SNAP on childhood food insecu-rity. When utilized by pregnant women, SNAP benefits are associated with decreased rates of low birth weight. In households with children, SNAP reduces the risk of food insecurity; enhances intake of B vitamins, iron, and cal- cium; and lowers the risk of anemia, obesity, poor health, developmental delays, hospitalization for failure to thrive, low academic test scores, and reports for child abuse or neglect. Children aged five through nine from SNAP-participating families had better academic outcomes and less obesity. \"Scientific evidence shows that SNAP is a wise invest - ment in the brains and bodies of American children\u2014 an investment that should be increased, not curtailed,\" stressed Frank. n common Anti-inflammatory drug can Treat Amyloidosis A study led by researchers from the Amyloidosis Center at BUSM and Boston Medical Center demonstrates that diflunisal\u2014an inexpensive, generic, and safe anti-inflam- matory drug marketed over the past 40 years for arthritis and pain\u2014successfully reduced neurological decline and preserved the quality of life in patients with familial trans- thyretin amyloidosis (ATTR). Published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), this study is one of the first examples of successful repurposing of a generic drug to treat a rare disease. The National Institutes of Health has advocated this research strategy as a way to increase the availability of treatments for rare diseases such as amyloidosis. John Berk, MD, associate professor of medicine at BUSM and clinical director of the Amyloidosis Center, designed the trial, led the international consortium of researchers, and served as the study's corresponding author. Jeffrey Kelly, PhD, a biochemist at the Scripps Research Institute, and Peter Dyck, MD, a neurologist at Mayo Clinic Rochester, were instrumental in developing the study. Familial amyloidosis is a rare inherited disorder in which mutated transthyretin protein aggregates in the blood and forms insoluble fibrils that cause tissue dam- age. Patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis develop debilitating peripheral and autonomic nerve damage, heart disease, and weight loss.

States with stronger policy scores had lower rates of binge drink - ing, and states with larger increases in policies also had larger decreases in binge drinking over time. \"Unfortunately, most states have not taken advantage of these policies to help drinkers consume responsibly, and to protect innocent citizens from the devastating secondhand effects and economic costs of excessive drinking,\" added Naimi. Overall, analyses showed that the policy environ- ment was largely responsible for state-level differences in binge drinking. \"The bottom line is that this study adds an important dimension to a large body of research demon-strating that alcohol policies matter\u2014and matter a great deal\u2014for reducing and preventing the fundamental build- ing block of alcohol-related problems,\" said Naimi. The study was supported by a National Institutes of Health grant. n Molecule That c ould Aid lung cancer detection and Treatment identified BUSM researchers have discovered a molecule that could help lead to noninvasive detection of lung cancer as well as treatment. Using RNA sequencing, the team looked at airway epithelial cells and identified a regulatory molecule less abundant in people with lung cancer that inhibits lung cancer cell growth. The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that this molecule may aid in diagnosing lung cancer in its earlier stages and could potentially, when at healthy lev - els, aid in treating the disease. MicroRNAs are a new class of molecules classified as important activity regulators of other genes. In this study, the research team used a next-generation RNA sequenc- ing technology and identified that a microRNA named miR-4423 in epithelial airway cells plays a major role in how these cells develop. In epithelial cells from the airway of smokers with lung cancer, levels of miR-4423 were decreased. \"These results suggest measuring the levels of microRNAs like miR-4423 in cells that line the airway could aid in lung cancer detection through a relatively noninvasive procedure,\" said Avrum Spira, MD, MSc, Alexander Graham Bell Professor of Medicine and chief of the Division of Computational Biomedicine at BUSM and one of the study's senior authors. \"Our findings open up the option to study whether returning miR-4423 levels to normal in the airway could help stop cancer growth and potentially be a way to treat lung cancer,\" said Catalina Perdomo, PhD, a researcher in the Division of Computational Biomedicine at BUSM and the paper's lead author. This study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health's National Cancer Institute Early Detection Research Network; the National Science Foundation Integrative Graduate Education and Research T raineeship; and Merit Review grants. n screening T ool to detect intimate Partner violence among f emale v eterans identified BUSM researchers have identified a promising screening tool to detect intimate partner violence (IPV) in females in the VA Boston Healthcare System. The findings, which appear in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, accu-rately detected 78 percent of women identified as abused within the past year by a more comprehensive and behav - iorally specific scale. IPV is a major public health issue, particularly among women receiving medical care at VA facilities. The researchers cite lifetime reports of IPV as high as 74 per - cent among this population, reinforcing the critical need for both brief and accurate screening tools. The four- item screening tool studied is called HITS (Hurt/Insult/Threaten/Scream) and can be used in under four min- utes; it is unique in that it assesses psychological IPV in addition to physical aggression. The study found that nearly 29 percent of women who had been involved in a recent intimate relationship reported physical, sexual, and/ or severe psychological IPV in the past year. The tool demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity in detecting IPV in this sample. Report of IPV in the past year was associated with higher scores for depression and Post T raumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The use of the HITS screening tool was also found to assess sexual IPV with a sensitivity of 87 percent, signify - ing that very few cases of sexual IPV go undetected. \"Further research is needed to validate questionnaire answers by mail with in-person clinical assessment, how - ever, HITS has the potential to effectively and efficiently identify a high proportion of female VHA patients who have experienced past-year IPV,\" explained lead author Intimate part - ner violence is a major public health issue, particularly among women receiving medi-cal care at VA facilities. \"These results suggest measuring the levels of microRNAs like miR-4423 in cells that line the airway could aid in lung cancer detection through a relatively noninvasive procedure.\"24 Boston University School of MedicineKatherine Iverson, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry at BUSM and clinical research psychologist at the VA Boston Healthcare System and the VA's National Center for PTSD. According to Iverson, the screening tool can quickly identify high-risk patients and coordinate referrals to more comprehensive support services.

The study raises awareness of the effects that tragic events such as terror attacks and mass shootings have not only on those directly affected but also on those with PTSD and other pre-existing psy - chological conditions. The researchers urge health care systems to be prepared in the future to treat individuals who were either directly or indirectly affected by such tragedies. Led by researchers at BUSM and the US Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD in Boston, this study was published online in the Journal of Traumatic Stress. PTSD is a psychiatric disorder defined by serious changes in cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and psy - chological functioning that can occur in response to a psychologically traumatic event. Previous studies have estimated that approximately eight percent of the US population will develop PTSD in their lifetime. That num- ber is significantly greater among combat veterans; as many as one out of five suffer symptoms of the disorder. Using data from an ongoing study of Boston-area vet - erans diagnosed with PTSD, the researchers conducted 71 telephone interviews within one week of the bombings. Because the researchers had symptom data from partici- pants approximately two months before that event, they were able to compare those levels with results from the interview one week after it. Of those interviewed, 38 percent reported that they were emotionally distressed by the bombings and the subsequent lockdown of Boston and other commu- nities. A majority of those participants said that the bombings caused them to experience flashbacks and the re-emergence of unwanted memories relating to their own past traumas. \"The effects felt by the veterans were likely due to the- matic similarities between the Marathon explosions and BUSM research the study raises aware- ness of the effects that tragic events such as terror attacks and mass shoot - ings have not only on those directly affected but also on those with Pt SD and other pre-existing psychological conditions.the veterans' own traumatic combat experiences, espe- cially for those deployed to recent conflicts character - ized by attacks involving improvised explosive devices,\" said Mark Miller, PhD, associate professor at BUSM and a clinical research psychologist at the National Center for PTSD at the VA Boston Healthcare System, who served as the study's principal investigator. There was no significant change of symptoms between the pre- and post-event data across the sample as a whole. However, for those who reported being personally affected, there was a strong correlation between distress at the time of the bombings and change in the severity of PTSD symptoms. According to the researchers, this change was primarily attributable to increases in intrusion and avoidance symptoms. \"This study highlights the fact that tragic local and national events of this type can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of individuals already suf - fering from PTSD,\" said Miller. \"It is crucial that relevant health care organizations understand this phenomenon and be prepared in the wake of tragedy to care not only for those who are directly impacted, but also for those with pre-existing psychological conditions, including our nation's veterans with PTSD.\" This study was funded by the US Department of Veterans Affairs.\"The effects felt by the veterans were likely due to thematic similarities between the Marathon explosions and the veter-ans' own traumatic com-bat experiences.\" Spring 2014 | www.bumc.bu.edu 25FACULTYnews Untangling the Brain's Wiring Alan Peters, PhD, Pioneering Neuroanatomist LAN PETERS, PhD, former BUSM chair and Waterhouse Professor of Anatomy and Neurobiology, retired last fall after 47 years on the Medical Campus. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, when he was a lecturer in anatomy at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, the detailed, or fine structure of the brain was not well understood. However, a revolution in better understanding the central nervous system was under way, as electron microscopic and neuron-tracing tech- niques were developed. It was the beginning of \" Alan Peters is one of the foremost anatomists of the mammalian nervous system. He was one of the first to determine the structure of myelin sheaths in the central nervous system and use light and electron microscopy to characterize the ultrastructure of neuroglia and neurons, as well as the micro circuitry and organization of neurons in the cerebral cortex and the organization of thalamocortical projections.\" \u2014The History of Neuroscience in Autobiography, Volume 5, ed. Larry r. s quireADr. Alan Peters and his longtime research associate Claire Folger at the Jeol transmission electron microscope.26 Boston University School of Medicineunderstanding the characteristics of nerve and neuroglial cells and how neuron cells connect to each other through synapses. Peters was pivotal to this revolution in knowl-edge and characterization of these struc- tures. He was the first to show the spiraled structure of the central myelin sheath and among the first to examine the development and comparative anatomy of nerve sheaths. This work and his early examination of the fine structure of the cerebral cortex, about which little was known at the time, not only advanced the understanding of the nervous system, it brought Peters to the attention of BUSM. The School was looking for a chair for the Department of Anatomy, which was essen-tially a teaching department with little in the way of a research program. \"They were looking for a scientist who would build up the research program,\" recalls Peters. In 1966, at the age of 36, he became chair of the depart - ment and served in that position for 32 years. He was also named Waterhouse Professor of Anatomy and Neurobiology. According to Peters, when he came to BUSM in 1966, there were five fac-ulty members teaching approximately 80 medical students and the department \"had some reputation for studying the ner - vous system.\" T oday, the Department of Anatomy & Neurobiology houses some 29 core faculty members, 22 affiliated faculty members, and seven postdoctoral fel-lows. In addition to teaching medical and dental students, the department is training 18 PhD and MD/PhD students along with 16 master's degree students. The depart - ment's research comprises 12 laboratories and is funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Veterans Administration, and private foundations and industry. Born in Nottingham, England, Peters received his undergraduate (1951) and doctoral (1954) degrees in zoology at the University of Bristol, England. \"In the old days in the British school sys- tem, you took an exam to go to grammar school at the age of 11,\" says Peters. \"The brightest were assigned to read classics, the second, or A group did German and physics, while a third group, mine, did biology, and the fourth group did general studies.\"When it came time for me to attend uni- versity, I was accepted at Cambridge to study medicine, but at that time those returning from the war got preference for University places so that I would have had to wait for two years to start medical studies. I didn't want to wait that long, and so I decided to study zoology instead.\" After obtaining his PhD, Peters fulfilled his two years of military service, after which he went to the University of Edinburgh as a post - doctoral fellow in anatomy. \"I decided I liked anatomy more than zoology, and I thought the brain was the most interesting part of the body to study,\" he says. \"Not much was known about the detailed structure of the brain at that time, and so it seemed a good topic for study.\" Peters's early work focused on light micro- scopic silver staining of nervous tissue, one of the few methods available for examining the nervous system by light microscopy in tissue sections. While this represented a continu-ation of his graduate work, he soon became interested in the emerging field of electron microscopy. \"Very little was known at that time about the fine structure of nerve cells and their supporting neuroglia, and so almost every time we examined a thin section by electron microscopy, we saw something new and profiles of pieces of various cells types,\" he explains. \"The problem was to identify the origins of the various types of profiles that we saw in thin sections being examined by elec- tron microscopy.\" While a visiting professor at Harvard Medical School from 1963 to 1964, Peters began work with Sanford Palay, MD, Bullard Professor of Neuroanatomy at Harvard, and Henry deF. Webster, MD, who became chief of the section of neuropathology at the National Institutes of Health. In 1970 the FACULTY news AlAn PeTers is an exceptional neuroscientist whose uncompromising standards of excellence throughout a long and remarkably productive career have advanced the art and science of our field, most notably related to a presentation of the fine structure of the nervous system. he has set global standards for understanding how the nervous system is organized at the cellular level and how it ages. his generous dedication as a scientist, fueled by his inexhaustible curiosity and remarkably vast depth of knowledge, produced a legacy of highly respected graduates and postdocs\u2014as well as many others whom he less formally men-tored\u2014who have made significant contributions to the discipline. i attribute my professional accomplishments and love of my career to Alan Peters, my mentor since i first came to BUsM as his postdoctoral fellow in 1972. he taught me to capture the beauty that resides in the art of electron microscopy and has been a trusted source of realistic appraisal and encouragement. he ingrained in me the belief that extremely high standards are attainable and to never settle for just \"good enough\" in both scientific thinking and the written expression of it. he exemplifies that clarity in all forms of expression is key to the successful communication of ideas. no one has had his degree of influence on my professional development. As a mentor, department chair, and friend, Alan Peters has been unfailingly fair, supportive, and generous with his time. he is always professional and leads by example. he is notably acces-sible, respectful, and approachable. indeed, he is a genuine model of the complete gentleman and academician.ThoUGhT s on AlAn PeTers By Deborah Vaughan, PhD, professor of anatomy & neurobiology\" We wanted to know how behaviors change and which components of the brain might be responsible for cognitive decline. We tried to fig - ure out how the two fit together.\" \u2014Alan p eters, p hDSpring 2014 | www.bumc.bu.edu 27three researchers produced the definitive text, The Fine Structure of the Nervous System, which was so successful that three editions were eventually published, the last in 1991. In the late 1960s there were few stud- ies of the characteristics of cells and their processes in the cerebral cortex. \"In reality, the only way to approach the problem of the identification of characteristics of the vari- ous components of the cerebral cortex was to sit down at the electron microscope for long hours and take pictures of anything that looked interesting. We would then go over the micrographs and use grease pencils to try to label each profile and assign it a cell type,\" Peters recalls. Peters and his associates published some of the first studies that described the com-ponents of the cerebral cortex, including the classification of dendritic spines. They developed methods for estimating the num- ber of synapses on the surfaces of neuronal cell bodies and described the organization of pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex into modules. With visiting researcher Alfonso Fairen, he also developed a Golgi/EM tech- nique that made it possible, for the first time, to examine neurons by light microscopy and then by electron microscopy to unravel their synaptic connections. In the early 1970s, Peters began study - ing changes in the normal brain as it ages; he and his colleagues were among the first to establish that normal cognitive decline is not due to significant neuronal loss from cerebral cortex, which had been the accepted assumption until then. Working with Marrot Sinex, MD, BUSM chair of biochemistry at that time, they obtained the first program project grant from the National Institute on Aging to study the effects of aging on the brain. After the first five years, Peters became the principal investigator on the grant, which was subsequently funded for 30 years. \"We wanted to know how behaviors change and which components of the brain might be responsible for cognitive decline,\" explains Peters. \"So we tried to figure out how the two fit together.\" In 1974, he and Deborah Vaughan, PhD, now BUSM profes- sor of anatomy and neurobiology, published one of the first studies of the effects of age on neuroglial cells. (Some of the electron microscopic images that show the effects of aging on the vari-ous components of the brain can be found at www.bu.edu/ agingbrain, a website Peters and his longtime collaborator Claire Folger recently created.) T oday, Peters continues his work in the department's Laboratory of Electron Microscopy, where he focuses on the effects of normal aging on the cerebral cortex and white matter. During his career, Peters served as an affiliate scientist at the Y erkes Regional Primate Research Center of Emory University in Atlanta. Among his many honors, Peters received the Henry Gray Award from the American Association of Anatomists and FIGURE 1 FIGURE 2 the Sanford L. Palay Award from the Journal of Comparative Anatomy. He is a fellow of the American Association of Anatomists and received an honorary doctor of science from the University of Edinburgh in 2011. He served as president of the American Association of Anatomy and chairman and president of the American Association of Anatomists. In 1995, a special issue of the Journal of Comparative Neurology was dedi-cated to him, and his portrait was included in a 2001 photo exhibition of Boston-area leaders titled \"Beautiful Minds.\" He has been included in Who's Who in America, Men of Achievement, International Who's Who in Medicine, and Who's Who in Frontiers of Science and T echnology . He has authored more than 200 scientific publications and authored or co-authored 19 books. At age 83, with more than half a century of seminal research to his credit and the legacy of having created an outstanding program that helps advance the careers of scientists who themselves have made major contribu- tions to understanding the structure of the brain, Peters believes it is a good time to retire. He fondly characterizes his BU years as \"excellent and collegial\" and cites the many opportunities for collaboration that the Boston scientific community afforded him. \"It has been a great privilege and joy to have had the opportunity to work with Alan Peters, who is a true giant in the neuroana- tomical sciences, as well as a gracious, warm, and thoughtful colleague,\" says Jennifer Luebke, PhD, associate professor of anatomy and neurobiology and director of the depart - ment's graduate program. \"His vast knowl- edge of the fine structure of the brain, his deep scientific insights, his extraordinarily beautiful and elegant body of work, and his uncompro- mising and exemplary standards have been a constant inspiration to me, as they have been to countless others around the world. Without question, Dr. Peters's seminal work on the fine structure of the nervous system will continue to inspire and motivate generations of neuro- scientists to come.\" \"Boston University School of Medicine has been singularly privileged to have had the decades of scientific rigor, pioneering discov - ery, and exemplary mentoring that Dr. Alan Peters has given to our School and commu- nity,\" says Dean Karen Antman, MD. \"His remarkable career highlights how enriching the pursuit of scientific knowledge is and how much it contributes to the world.\" n(figure 1) Electron micrograph of a dendritic spine receiving an excitatory synapse from The Fine Structure of the Nervous System .

Ciraulo, Md, professor and chair of psychiatry and chief of the BMC Department of Psychiatry, co-edited the recently published second edition of the Clinical Manual of Addiction Psychopharmacology, a thorough update on the pharmacology of drugs and abuse and the medications used to treat dependence. The manual delves into a broad range of addictive substances and covers sig-nificant advances that have been made since the publi-cation of the first edition. \"This book is an invalu- able reference for clinicians, including psychiatrists, psychiatric residents and fellows, as well as other mental health practitioners who encounter individuals with substance-related disorders in the course of their clinical work,\" said Dr. Ciraulo. \"The material is presented in an orga-nized fashion with the most up-to-date information on psychopharmacology.\" Ciraulo co-edited the manual with Henry R. Kranzler, MD, Leah R. James p okines, phd , daBfa, assistant profes-sor in the BUSM Forensic Anthropology Program, recently co-edited a groundbreaking reference book, Manual of Forensic Taphonomy. The word 'taphonomy' derives from ancient Greek, with 'tapho' referring to burial and 'nomos' to laws. The book represents the first update in the field in more than a decade. The field of taphonomy examines postmortem changes in bodies, for both recent forensic cases and archaeological/paleonto-logical research on more ancient remains. The work studies changes to bones caused by multiple forces, including the effects of marine and freshwater environments, scaveng-ing, thermal alteration, and human ritual and cemetery practices. The inherent vari-ations in bone structure and morphology affecting their differential survival and the survivability of DNA in vary - ing environments are also examined. Pokines's research includes vertebrate oste- ology, zooarchaeology, taphonomy, and paleoecol- ogy, and he has ongoing archaeological projects in the Bolivian Andes (Tiwanaku and related sites), the Nile Delta (T ell Timai), and the Paleolithic site of northern Jordan.

AwA rDs Benjamin Wolozin, Md , phd, professor of pharmacology and neurology, received the Alzheimer's Association Zenith Fellows Award, a $450,000 grant dispersed over three years. Initiated in 1991, the award sup- ports cutting-edge basic science or biomedi-cal research that addresses fundamental problems related to early detection, etiology pathogenesis, treatment, and/ or prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The Wolozin Lab won the award with its proposal \"It T akes TIA to T angle: The Role of RNA-Binding Proteins in AD.\" The lab already has discovered an RNA-binding protein that induces tau misfolding, one of the essen-tial steps that leads to cognitive loss in AD. This award will allow the Wolozin Lab to experimentally induce the misfolding, inves-tigate the factors that regulate it, and\u2014in the future\u2014possibly design therapeutics to prevent it. n kenneth C. e delin, Md, on December 30, 2013, at the age of 74. Dr. Edelin was the for - mer BUSM associate dean for Minority Affairs, now Diversity & Multicultural Affairs, profes- sor and chair of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston City Hospital, now BMC. He was well known for a 1975 manslaugh- ter conviction for performing a legal abortion, which was over - turned on appeal in a landmark test of medical, legal, religious, and political issues surrounding abortion in America. Dr. Edelin was recognized for his concern for indigent patients, and spoke often of the need for legal and safe abortions as a necessary alternative to the dangerous back-alley practices of the past. Dr. Edelin received his bach- elor's degree from Columbia College in 1961 and his medical degree from Meharry Medical College in Nashville, T ennessee, in 1967. He served in the US Air Force from 1968 to 1971, rising to captain with an internship at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. After his discharge, he completed a medical residency at Boston City Hospital from 1971 to 1974. He became the FACULTY news IN Memoriam hospital's first black chief resi-dent in obstetrics and gynecol- ogy in 1973, and that October \u2014nine months after Roe v. Wade\u2014performed the abortion that led to his arrest. After his acquittal, Dr. Edelin became a professor of obstet - rics and gynecology at BUSM and chair of the department for a decade, until 1989. He also was chief of obstetrics and gynecol- ogy at Boston City Hospital and managing director of the Roxbury Comprehensive Community Health Center, the largest pro-vider of primary health services for Boston's African American community. He was chair of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America from 1989 to 1992, and a director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and of the Guttmacher Institute, which promotes reproductive health. He served as associate dean for minority affairs under Deans Chobanian and Antman and was beloved by the many medical students for whom he served as an outstand-ing role model. He retired from teaching in 2006, but returned to the School frequently during his retirement for academic and student events. He authored many articles on the prevention of teenage pregnancy and the perils of sub- stance abuse during pregnancy. In 2007 he published a mem- oir, Broken Justice: A True Story of Race, Sex and Revenge in a Boston Courtroom. His case was the sub- ject of a 1978 book, The Baby in the Bottle by William A. Nolen, and a play, As to the Meaning of Words, by Mark Eichman that was staged in New Y ork in 1981. *Information contained in this obituary is based on information from the New Y ork Times.

It seems like just yesterday that they began their journey at the White Coat Ceremony and the Graduate Medical Sciences welcoming events. I am exceedingly proud to be a part of an institu- tion with such an engaged and qualified student body. While they may be leaving the halls of BUSM, they are joining the distinguished ranks of the BUSM alumni family. They are the new face of the School's alumni and the future leaders of our profession. I feel fortunate that in my position as associate dean for alumni affairs, part of what I do is bring students and alumni together. A great example of this is the Phonathon pro- gram, which gives students a unique opportunity to connect directly with alumni. In just a short conversation, alumni can offer invaluable insight and counsel. In turn, students make alumni feel connected to BUSM, reassure them that their generosity is having a real and meaningful impact, and rein-force the fact that students today are every bit as dedicated as they ever were. I am happy to report that thirty-nine stu- dent and alumni volunteers raised more than $90,000 from generous alumni donors in just two nights! Another student/ alumni collaboration is just around the corner: the 2014 BUSM Alumni Weekend is May 2-3 at BUSM and the T aj Boston hotel. This is a wonderful opportu- nity for alumni to return to campus and learn what it's like to be a current BUSM student\u2014and what better way of doing that than having student-run tours and discussion panels? Come join your fellow classmates and see firsthand the amazing advancements the School has made! If you can't make it to Boston, you can still stay con- nected through this magazine, our alumni e-newsletter, and reunion mailings. Let us know how you are doing by sharing your career and life updates. We look forward to hearing from you. Best regards, Jean E.
