These cutting-edge treatments - which include cancer vaccines, cellular therapies, immune checkpoint inhibitors and other drugs - can sometimes overstimulate the immune system, leading to side effects that range from minor to serious. Some are easily managed with steroids, while others require care from experts in specific organ systems or immunosuppression (techniques to curb the immune response). Sometimes these side effects necessitate suspending the patient's cancer treatment, and there may be questions about whether it's safe to restart. The UCSF Cancer Immunotherapy Toxicity Evaluation (CITE) Program cares for patients with complex, difficult-to-treat side effects from immunotherapy. If you're experiencing such side effects, you may be finding it challenging to get a correct diagnosis and access to appropriate providers. The CITE Program brings together a dedicated, experienced team of oncologists and other specialists who will collaboratively manage your condition. Our care team also serves as a resource for doctors outside UCSF seeking second opinions on their patients with immunotherapy-related side effects. The CITE Program is one of a kind in the Bay Area and among the first of its kind in the nation. In addition to patient care, our team is dedicated to advancing research on immunotherapy through clinical trials (studies of promising new treatments) and the banking of blood and tissue specimens. Our program works closely with other specialty groups at UCSF, including the Cancer Immunotherapy Program, which evaluates these agents in early phases of development.
