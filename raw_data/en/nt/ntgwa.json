In the near future, the challenges related to feeding are anticipated to escalate, encompassing the nutritional needs to sustain an overpopulated world. Therefore, it is expected that a better understanding of the interactions between microorganisms within the digestive tract will allow their modulation in order to provide an improvement in the immune system, feed efficiency or the promotion of nutritional characteristics in production animals, among others. In the present study, the main effects of experimental diets in production animals were described, emphasizing the diversity of the bacterial populations found in response to the diets, ordering them between polygastric and monogastric animals, and then describing the experimental diets used and their effect on the microorganisms. It is hoped that this study will help as a first general approach to the study of the role of the microbiome in production animals under different diets.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-08-31", "cleaned_text": "this context, the number of research projects related to solving food problems has increased, studies based on the microbiome being a focus of great interest, especially those related to diets in animals. To begin with, it is necessary to differentiate between the terms microbiota and microbiome, the former being defined as the \"set of microorganisms present in a defined environment\" [ [2](#B2-microorganisms-11-02219)], while microbiome can refer to the microorganisms present in a given habitat that have different physicochemical properties, interact with their environment and can confer microbiological resistance to their host [ [3](#B3-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Furthermore, the microbiome involves and considers interactions between bacteria, archaea, viruses, and fungi, as well as between biotic and abiotic factors involved [ [4](#B4-microorganisms-11-02219), [5](#B5-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The alteration of the microorganisms involved in the microbiome can cause dysbiosis, which consists of the imbalance of a healthy microbiome, where the symbiotic relationships of the microbiota are diminished, altering productivity, and causing health problems [ [6](#B6-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Although, studies on the microbiome have increased during the last years, they are mostly based on humans, existing a smaller number related to animals destined to food production [ [7](#B7-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [8](#B8-microorganisms-11-02219)]. At the same time, studies highlight the action of tannins to reduce fiber degradation, as well as polyphenols to help reduce methane gas production [ [9](#B9-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Other studies have proposed that the concentration of polyphenols affects the intestinal epithelial barrier of pigs in vitro using chestnut extracts, an important source of polyphenols, which at low concentrations can have a protective effect on intestinal epithelial cells [ [10](#B10-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In monogastric animals such as chickens and pigs the consumption of dietary fiber exerts significant effects on the integrity of the intestinal mucosa. Therefore, a dietary fiber deficiency leads to loss of functions of the intestinal mucosa due to the degradation of polysaccharides by bacteria [ [11](#B11-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In addition, the microbiota has been implicated in the immune response as demonstrated in mouse experiments [ [12](#B12-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [13](#B13-microorganisms-11-02219)]. This implies that a better understanding of the microbiota could avoid the use of synthetic agents such as antibiotics in the fight against pathogens. This coincides with the vision of consumers to produce healthier animals and decrease the promotion of resistance genes [ [14](#B14-microorganisms-11-02219)]. On the other hand, the interactions between dominant microorganisms and variations within the microbiota have been scarcely described in animals, where the multiple variants, including genetic and functional, and diverse life spans between individuals make it even more difficult to assess. Therefore, more studies are required to compile and structure the information generated and thus help to improve animal production and its derivatives in an economic and healthy environment that ensures a benefit to the animal [ [15](#B15-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The present review aims to describe the main effects of experimental diets in production animals, according to changes in the composition of the basal diet and inclusion of feed additives, and their relationship with the proliferation or inhibition of different microorganisms present in the intestinal microbiome. A summary of the diets can be found in the [supplementary material (Table S1)](#app1-microorganisms-11-02219). 2. Microbiome [16](#B16-microorganisms-11-02219)]. These interact in a homeostasis within the organism in a complex system where, by any alteration, microbial populations can trigger chains of metabolic reactions that influence at a structural level and affect in a physiological way the development and growth of intestinal mucosa [ [17](#B17-microorganisms-11-02219)]. These components interact within the organism in a multi-complex system, maintaining a state of homeostasis. However, by any alteration, microbial populations can trigger cascades of metabolic reactions that profoundly influence the structural and physiological aspects, ultimately affecting the development and growth of the intestinal mucosa [ [18](#B18-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The composition of microbial populations is diverse; for example, it is estimated that just within the human gastrointestinal tract live about 100 trillion microorganisms, which are taxonomically classified by genus, family, order, and phylum [ [19](#B19-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The onset of microbiome formation is not entirely clear, theorizing that newborn mammals have a sterile microbiome and that it is created at the first interaction outside the womb [ [20](#B20-microorganisms-11-02219)]. It has also been indicated that in mammals colonization begins at birth and starts with the colonization of aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria in the first instance through the passage of the vaginal canal, which can vary between species and leaves doubts in cases where cesarean sections are performed [ [21](#B21-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In turn, it is established that initial colonization is fundamental for the development of the neonate; for example, in ruminants the period from birth to weaning is of great importance for the colonization of the microbiome in the rumen and is linked to the concept of coevolution between the microorganisms and the individual [ [22](#B22-microorganisms-11-02219)]. It has also been pointed out in other studies, based on the immune metabolism and microorganisms, that stress caused at weaning can influence immune development and cause a dysbiosis in the microbiota that alters the homeostasis between microorganisms with the promotion of pathogenic colonies [ [23](#B23-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Other studies add concepts such as the \"social microbiome\", highlighting that individuals of the same group have a greater similarity between their microbial populations compared to those that do not share the same environment and, therefore, lacking interactions. However, these studies also indicate that diets, genetics, and geographical locations contribute to similarities in microbial composition between species, suggesting that it is not necessarily related to the social transmission of microorganisms between individuals [ [24](#B24-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Additionally, it has been established that factors associated with captivity, such as zoos, farms, and laboratories, can trigger metabolic problems, and modify digestion and reproduction by increasing stress [ [25](#B25-microorganisms-11-02219)]. So, comparing the same species that have been placed in captivity or in the wild, differences in the relative abundance of bacterial taxa can be found [ [26](#B26-microorganisms-11-02219)]. However, it has been determined that the main influencing factor on the microbiota is the diet used in animals, whether in captivity or in a controlled environment [ [25](#B25-microorganisms-11-02219)]. And to a lesser degree it has been reported that contact with soil, water or other exogenous elements contribute to the conformation of the microbial community; for example, in ruminants it has been described that up to 3% of the microbial community is composed of these exogenous microorganisms [ [27](#B27-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [28](#B28-microorganisms-11-02219)]. On the other hand, there is research that analyzes the change of the microbiome using specific supplements in diets, such as additives, hormones, amino acids, probiotics and vitamins. To help exemplify productive animals, the following is a review of experimental diets that influenced the microbiome ordered according to type and species. The studies are categorized into two groups: firstly, those that made modifications to the basal diet, involving alterations in composition ratios, the addition of foods with distinct qualities, or replacement of specific components. Secondly, we explore those investigations that added supplements, such as probiotics, hormones, amino acids or vitamins, among others relevant factors. 3. Ruminant Animals [29](#B29-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The function of the different compartments is diverse and highly specialized. The feed once ingested by the ruminant enters the esophagus and then the pre-stomach (rumen, reticulum, and omasum) where a process of fermentation and decomposition occurs, and then enters the abomasum where chemical and enzymatic digestion occurs [ [30](#B30-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The rumen is constituted by different microorganisms and is where volatile fatty acids are generated in addition to other proteins for the ruminant in the fermentation process carried out especially by archaea. On the other hand, it is important to highlight that the whole process involves the use and expulsion of nitrogen into the environment in the form of methane gas (CH4), which has no nutritional value for the animal and so it is eliminated as a by-product of rumen fermentation, a product of the archaea using carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) present in the rumen after fiber degradation [ [31](#B31-microorganisms-11-02219)]. At least 65% of emissions of pollutant gases such as methane gas that contaminate the terrestrial atmosphere are produced by the livestock sector, most of them produced by ruminants, and cattle destined for meat or milk production being mainly responsible as generating most of the CH4 emissions [ [32](#B32-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Studies have highlighted that there are communities of microorganisms responsible for lower methane gas elimination in ruminants; specifically in studies with lambs it was lower H2 production [ [33](#B33-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In turn, studies in dairy cows show that CH4 emission is mainly linked to H2-producing bacteria such as Ruminococcaceae, Christensenellaceae, and Lachnospiraceae, and that in the high CH4 emission group, Succinivibrionaceae and Methanosphaera spp. communities are found in lower abundance [ [34](#B34-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Thus, research to reduce CH4 emissions is a latent problem, for which different alternatives have been evaluated [ [35](#B35-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [36](#B36-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The temperature inside the rumen ranges between 38 to 42 \u00b0C and the pH is normally between 5.5 to 7.0, depending on the diet. The microorganisms present are composed of bacteria, archaea, protozoa and fungi, of which bacteria have a concentration between 1010 to 1011 bacteria per milliliter in the rumen [ [37](#B37-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [38](#B38-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Among those classified methanogens, the genera Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii and rumen archaea [ [39](#B39-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The rumen archaea generally use H2 for the production of CH4; it is estimated that a reduction or inhibition of the archaea in the rumen would produce an increase in H2 that would affect the functions of the enzymes, reducing the efficiency in the conversion of food into nutrients [ [40](#B40-microorganisms-11-02219)]. However, it is known that there are varieties that can use formate, acetate, methyl compounds, and ethanol as an alternative to H2 [ [39](#B39-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [41](#B41-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The concentration of fungi in the rumen is 103 and 106 zoospores per milliliter, belonging to the class Neocallimastigomycetes, being anaerobic fungi found in the digestive and proteolytic activity, their main function being fiber digestion by degrading structural polymers of plant origin [ [37](#B37-microorganisms-11-02219), [42](#B42-microorganisms-11-02219)]. 3.1. Cattle [43](#B43-microorganisms-11-02219)]. By 2021, beef production reached a total of 58.152 million tons, where the United States is the largest beef producer reaching 12.730 million tons followed by Brazil and China [ [44](#B44-microorganisms-11-02219)]. By 2030, beef production is expected to reach 44 million tons worldwide [ [45](#B45-microorganisms-11-02219)]. On the other hand, in 2021, dairy production reached a production of 544.072 million tons of cow's milk, with the European Union being the main producer with 145.700 million tons, followed by the United States and India [ [46](#B46-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Demand for dairy products is estimated to increase over the next 50 years [ [47](#B47-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In cattle it has been described that can be found throughout the gastrointestinal tract. In turn, genera such as Prevotella, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, unclassified Rikenellaceae, unclassified Christensenellaceae, and unclassified Bacteroidales have been reported in the rumen digesta, and Butyrivibrio, unclassified bacteria, Desulfobulbus, and in the abomasum, Prevotella, Butyrivibrio, and Ruminoccocus have been described. Other genera such as unclassified Enterobacteriaceae have been described in the small intestine lumen and Acinebacter in samples of the small intestine mucosa. Finally, in the large intestine section, unclassified Peptostreptococcaceae, Turicibacter, and Clostridium genera have been seen in lumen was used to modify ruminal fermentation and maximize forage yield. The observed results showed an increase in populations of cellulolytic bacteria highlighting Ruminococcus flavefaciens and Fibrobacter succinogenes that possess specific mechanisms for cellulose adhesion and breakdown [ [53](#B53-microorganisms-11-02219)], accompanied by a reduction in lactate-producing bacteria such as Streptococcus bovis. This shift among populations led to an increase in volatile fatty acids (VFA) and an increase in the amount of protein due to a decrease in the protozoan Entodinium, which is responsible for ingesting bacteria and reducing the microbial protein supply to the small intestine. Therefore, the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae provided higher energy efficiency and better nitrogen utilization [ [54](#B54-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [55](#B55-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The results of this experiment indicated that, in the supplemented experimental group, the proportion of Bacteroidetes was higher than that of Firmicutes. At the family level the populations found in the experimental groups were Prevotella, Fibrobacteraceae and Burkholderiales. However, in control animals it was found that in populations of the phylum Firmicutes, the orders Clostridiales, Erysipelotrichales and Lactobacillales were more abundant than in experimental cows [ [56](#B56-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [57](#B57-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The experiment was conducted on three groups of supplemented cows; a control diet (25 g flaxseed oil/kg DM (FO); a diet with 25 g flaxseed oil/kg DM and 1.2 g propolis-based product/kg DM (PBP); and a diet with flaxseed oil, PBP and 375 IU vitamin E/kg DM (PBP-E). The results indicated that the diet supplied with flaxseed oil (FO) produced a decrease in protozoa, with a greater number of Entodinium and a lower number of Isotricha, an increase in bacterial species Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, and a reduction in the populations of Anaerovibrio lipolytica and Methanobrevibacter ruminantium. Therefore, PBP and PBP-E treatments did not have a significant impact on microbial populations. However, they possess positive effects on milk quality by antioxidant activity and do not affect digestive parameters [ [58](#B58-microorganisms-11-02219)]. 3.2. Sheep [59](#B59-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In sheep studies the predominant microorganisms in the regions encompassing the sheep stomach have been Prevotella, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, and Butyrivibrio. been described. On the other hand, the three most dominant genera in the small intestine are Escherichia, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminocococcus; in the small intestine Ruminocococcus, unclassified Ruminococcaceae and Prevotella. R. flavefaciens, B. fibrisolvens and S. ruminantium are found. Predominant throughout the gastrointestinal tract are the genera of Prevotella, designed by E. Du et al. (2022) used castrated male lambs of the Hu breed and supplemented them with diets based on total mixed ration (TMR) with different inclusion levels of forage canola, from 0, 100, 200, 200, 300 and 400 g/kg1, in order to know the effects on meat quality and the changes caused in the microbiome. Results at the phylum level indicated that Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes accounted for ~92.5% of the total taxa and dominated rumen In contrast, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes, Tenericutes, and Euryarchaeota were less abundant, representing 0.1-10.0% of the total bacteria for all lambs. In addition, among the cellulose degrading microorganisms, the following genera were found Fibrobacter, Eubacterium and Ruminiclostridium. The conclusion was that the inclusion of forage canola increases the levels of amino acids and intramuscular -linolenic acid in terms of meat quality, in addition to promoting the growth of cellulolytic bacteria in the rumen [ [57](#B57-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [64](#B64-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Research by Kafantaris et al. (2017) used grape pomace in male Chios lambs to use polyphenols as prebiotic supplements to improve intestinal health. For this purpose, they used diets containing a standard diet for the control group. The experimental group used a diet containing silage with grape The indicated a reduction in Enterobacteriaceae in the fecal microflora, accompanied by a reduction in Escherichia coli, as well as other pathogenic bacteria. In turn, the population of Bifidobacterium, beneficial bacteria in polyphenol treatment, increased [ [65](#B65-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [66](#B66-microorganisms-11-02219)]. One study used Hu Chinese lambs randomized in a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial arrangement with a first factor of high metabolizing energy (HE) and low metabolizing energy (LE), with 4 treatments of high protein (HP) and low protein (LP) for the second factor, respectively. The results detected 16 phyla, highlighting Bacteroidetes as the most dominant, followed by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes. At the genus level, 126 were identified, highlighting Prevotella, the gut group, Succinivibrionaceae, and Ruminococcaceae, present in all treatments. At the genus level, the dominant members of the high metabolizing energy (HE) group samples contained mainly Veillonellaceae, Succinivibrionaceae, and Veillonellaceae. Low metabolizing energy (LE) groups were dominated by Bacteroidales and Lachnospiraceae. The results obtained give a profile of bacteria present in the microbiome under varying energy and protein, thereby offering a valuable profile for future studies [ [67](#B67-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [68](#B68-microorganisms-11-02219), [69](#B69-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Gebeyew et al. (2021) used male Hulunbuir lambs fed diets with normal protein (NP), low protein (LP) and an LP diet supplemented with Met and Lys (LP + RML). The results indicated that LP + RML diets increased the Paenarthrobacter population in the jejunum and ileum. Ruminococcus and Clostridium were reduced in the jejunum and enriched in the ileum; Saccharimonas decreased in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum; and Gastranaerophilales proliferation increased in the duodenum. This study concluded that the inclusion of methionine and lysine does not result in adverse alterations in the microbiota gut, conversely, contributes to a healthier microbial community [ [70](#B70-microorganisms-11-02219)]. 3.3. Goats [71](#B71-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The cause of their popularity is due to the healthier nutritional qualities present in goat meat (Chevon), containing a lower level of fat, saturated fat and cholesterol. It also has a higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), being healthier than other red meats [ [72](#B72-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Among the genera identified in the stomach are Prevotella, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group. the Romboutsia, WCHB1-41_ge, p-1088-a5_gut_group, and Christensenellaceae_R-7_group. Finally, the large intestine region presents a higher abundance of the genera Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, Bacteroides UCG-010_ge, UCG-005, and Alistipes [ [73](#B73-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In the main hemp seeds (linoleic acid) and flaxseeds (alpha linoleic acid) as feed supplements. Three treatments were carried out: control diet; diet supplemented with flaxseed; and diet supplemented with hempseed. The results for the two experimental treatments showed the predominance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes phyla with a high abundance of Prevotellaceae and Veillonellaceae and a low abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Lachnospiraceae. The Prevotellaceae family was dominant in the experimental diets at both sampling times. In all treatments, the genus Methanobrevibacter was the main Archaea found. At the genus level, flaxseed supplementation increased Succinivibrio spp. and Fibrobacter spp. populations, while decreasing the relative abundance of Prevotella spp. Based on this research, it is manifested that fatty acid intake in the diet of alpine goats modifies the intestinal microbiome, which would also affect the fatty acids presented in milk [ [78](#B78-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [79](#B79-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The research used Boer goats, providing a control diet (basal diet without additives) plus two experimental diets: a basal diet +1.5% (w/w) of of Andrographis paniculata with whole plant powder (APW). The results found that the treatment that included Andrographis paniculata powder favored the growth of the genus Ruminococcus (albus, flavefaciens) and Fibrobacter succinogenes [82](#B82-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [83](#B83-microorganisms-11-02219)]. (2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)-butanoic acid) and isopropyl ester which are usually supplied at the post-ruminal stage. HMBi can consistently provide methionine by degrading at slower rate in the rumen. In addition, it provides multiple benefits in terms of biological activity, nutrient digestibility, and milk composition. Chen et al. (2020) tested the effects of HMBi on different parameters in Xiang Dong black goats. They used a control supplied by a basal diet and implemented with HMBi at the following proportions: 0%; 0.05%; 0.10%; and 0.20%. At the microbiota level, most frequently found phylum was Bacteroidetes followed by Firmicutes; at the genus Succinivibrio; Succinivibrio, Bilophila, and Ruminobacter could be related to increased feed intake, although further studies are needed to determine their role. It was concluded that methionine administration had no detrimental effects on goats [ [84](#B84-microorganisms-11-02219)]. 4. Monogastric Animals [85](#B85-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In turn, the microorganisms present in the microbiome are dependent on multiple factors including diet. However, external factors like temperature can cause heat stress in animals, where in animals which, in turn, affects the intestinal composition and microbiota. Animals with absence of sweat glands such as chickens and pigs, experience differences in their bacterial composition as a result [ [86](#B86-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Other sources of stress such as confinement, geographical location, husbandry systems or factors such as breed and age are also determinants [ [87](#B87-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Therefore, the microorganisms found among monogastrics are different from each other. 4.1. Chickens [88](#B88-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [Figure 4](#microorganisms-11-02219-f004)). The ingested food is hydrated, ground into small particles, acidified and attacked by endogenous enzymes to obtain the macronutrients. The stomach has oxyntopeptic cells responsible for secreting both hydrochloric acid and pepsinogen, and lipase resulting from reflux from the duodenum can also be found. The functions of the proventriculus and gizzard (ventriculus) are, respectively, to initiate primary digestion using digestive enzymes and to exert a mechanical function by grinding the food to a suitable size to continue through the digestive tract [ [89](#B89-microorganisms-11-02219), [90](#B90-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The pH values present in some areas of the digestive system are: beak (6.7); crop (6.4); ileum (6.7); rectum (7.1). As described, the pH in chickens is more acidic than in other mammals and does not change during the life span. On the other hand, the constituent microorganisms of the microflora are obtained by the interaction of newly hatched chicks and the eggshell surface, changing over time [ [91](#B91-microorganisms-11-02219)]. It has been recorded that Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 is predominant in newly hatched chicks in the cecum, duodenum, and feces. However, Lactobacillus is more abundant in later stages such as after 35 days. Therefore, the genera found in feces are lactobacillus and Escherichia-Shigella, in the cecum Alistipes Blautia, Ruminiclostridium_5, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, and genus Acinetobacter in the duodenum [ [92](#B92-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Among the most recurrent genera within the tract [Figure 4](#microorganisms-11-02219-f004)) [ [93](#B93-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [94](#B94-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Recent research proposed the use of the active components present in Achyranthes japonica (AJE) as a feed supplement in Ross 308 broiler chickens [ [66](#B66-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Therefore, four experimental diets were used, a basal diet (CON), followed by treatments containing both the basal diet and different percentages of AJE extract: T1 (0.025% AJE), T2 (0.05% AJE), and T3 (0.1% AJE). In the fecal microflora, it was found that the Lactobacillus increased as AJE increased, while E. coli and Salmonella populations decreased as AJE increased. Thus, Park & Kim (2020) conclude that diets with AJE can improve parameters in broilers, such as growth performance, dry matter digestibility, and nitrogen. [95](#B95-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [96](#B96-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [97](#B97-microorganisms-11-02219)]. An investigation tested the effect of xylanase inclusion in ROSS 308 broilers by applying four experimental diets: Control (CON), control plus xylanase (XYL); control plus emulsifier and emulsifier (XYL + EMU). These diets were administered according to an initial phase (1 to 11 days), emphasizing the use of corn and rapeseed oil as supplementary fat, and in the growth and finishing phases (from 11 to 25 and from 25 to 42 days) beef tallow was integrated. Analyses showed that there were no significant differences in the populations of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Escherichia coli in the treatments containing xylanase or emulsifiers. On the other hand, Clostridium (butyric acid-producing bacteria) showed a decreased relative abundance in the emulsifier-containing groups. However, the other butyric acid-producing bacteria were largely unaffected by emulsifier treatment. Consequently, fermentation in the cecum and enzymatic digestion in the duodenum and ileum were favored upon EMU and XYL ingestion [ [98](#B98-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [99](#B99-microorganisms-11-02219)]. It is proposed that the application in Ross 308 chickens can improve intestinal health and improve the growth performance. A study conducted by Kwak et al. (2021) used three experimental diets in this type of chickens: (basal populations in the SPL diet at the phylum level were enhanced in the Firmicutes population over Bacteroidetes. At the genus level Lactobacillus increased in abundance and Streptococcus decreased. At the species level Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus salivarius and Akkermansia muciniphila showed an increase while Streptococcus gallolyticus was reduced in both the BAM and SPL treatments. It was concluded that the SPL diet contributed to improve intestinal defenses and alleviate inflammation, which promotes growth in animals [ [100](#B100-microorganisms-11-02219)]. 4.2. Pigs [101](#B101-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Its digestive system is composed of the mouth where the food is introduced, and the stomach which is made up of four regions and includes the esophageal, cardiac, fundic, and pyloric regions ( [Figure 5](#microorganisms-11-02219-f005)). The function of the cardia region is to mix the food by means of a mucus, then the gastric glands of the fundus digest the food with hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes, and thus the food is directed to the fundus. The pyloric region subsequently secretes mucus into the digestive membranes that serve as protection. Other structures present are the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum), where food absorption takes place; the liver secretes bile fluid and the pancreas secretes enzymes, followed by the large intestine constituted by the cecum which digests the fibrous part, and then the colon and rectum. The gastric system found in pigs performs similar functions as in humans. However, it presents some differences in size and shape; the porcine cecum is relatively larger, the porcine colon is spiral oriented and pigs lack an appendix [ [90](#B90-microorganisms-11-02219), [102](#B102-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Therefore, the anatomical, physiological, and immunological similarities between humans and pigs mean that the microorganisms present in pigs have similarities to those found in the human digestive system [ [103](#B103-microorganisms-11-02219), [104](#B104-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The microorganisms normally found in pigs can be classified into the following phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, highlighting the presence of Firmicutes phylum populations in the duodenum and jejunum, and of the Proteobacteria phylum in the gastric and compartments gut Subdoligranulum are present in most of the gastrointestinal tract of swine. [107](#B107-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Therefore, the search for sustainable carbohydrate alternatives for animal consumption has intensified, and studies have evaluated the administration of processed carbohydrates not suitable for human consumption that fall under the classification of Former foodstuff products (FFPs) [ [108](#B108-microorganisms-11-02219)], in Large White \u00d7 Landrace pigs using a standard diet for post-weaning piglets for the control group (CTR) and in the experimental group (FFPs) a standard diet including 30% residues of bakery products and wheat-derived varieties as carbohydrate sources. The results indicated that an inclusion of FFPs decreased microbial diversity and decreased the proportion of the genus lactobacillus, and increased the genera of bacteria belonging to the proteobacteria; however, it did not generate major changes in the microbial community and no problems in growth performance were observed [ [109](#B109-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [110](#B110-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [111](#B111-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Butyric acid can be found in salt form as sodium butyrate or as a triglyceride called tributyrin, both of which are used in humans and animals as prodrugs [ [112](#B112-microorganisms-11-02219)]. A work by Sun et al. (2020) sought to apply sodium butyrate in the diet of pigs using pigs from Yorkshire-Landrace \u00d7 Duroc boar crosses. The study considered three treatments: (1) basal diet; (2) basal diet + 40 ppm bacitracin; and (3) basal diet + 0.2% sodium butyrate. The results indicated in the cecum, with abundance from highest to lowest, respectively. At the genus level, treatment 3, containing sodium butyrate compared to treatment 1, showed a higher relative abundance of Anaerovibrio, Megasphaera, and Prevotella, and a decrease in Flavobacterium populations compared to group 1. On the other hand, the populations of the genus Dorea, Blautia, Desulfovibrio, Coprococcus, Succinivibrio, and Ruminococcus were decreased in the group with sodium butyrate, in contrast to group 2 containing zinc bacitracin. The authors proposed that the addition of sodium butyrate to the diet improves the small intestinal mucosa, promoting epithelial cell growth, and increasing villus length. In addition, it decreases carbohydrates and proteins entering the cecum and consequently decreases the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria [ [113](#B113-microorganisms-11-02219)]. On the other hand, Wang et al. (2019) proposed the use of tributyrin over sodium salt, pointing out that the latter tends to be absorbed by the upper digestive tract, whereas tributyrin can cross this barrier and be absorbed by the lower digestive tract. In this study, different levels of tributyrin were used in pigs (Duroc \u00d7 (Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire)) and a control diet was used followed by three dietary treatments with 250, 500 and 750 mg/kg of tributyrin. The results showed that the use of tributyrin increased the Lactobacillus/E. coli ratio, which is indicative of good intestinal health, thus reducing the negative health effects of E. coli infection [ [114](#B114-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [115](#B115-microorganisms-11-02219)], which acidify the pH of the intestinal tract, controlling pathogens and yeast hydrolysates that are sensitive to pH. In addition, Bacillus coagulans bacteria contain active substances such as -glucan and mannan which are constituents of the cell wall [ [116](#B116-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Therefore, it is expected that the use of Bacillus coagulans can help improve the health of the gastric system in animals and strengthen the immune system by functioning as a prebiotic. In a study by Shin et al. (2019), [Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire] \u00d7 Duroc pigs and three treatments were used: (1) Control diet (CON) and enramycin (20 mg/kg); (2) Diet with Bacillus coagulans (20 mg/kg, BC group); and (3) Diet with yeast hydrolysates (3000 mg/kg, YH group). The diet belonging to the BC group significantly increased the number of Bifidobacterium in the colon, followed by a decrease in E. coli counts. The YH diet increased Lactobacillus and Bacillus counts in the cecum, apart from increasing Bifidobacterium and Bacillus in the colon. Therefore, an increase in microbial populations beneficial to the host could be detected, demonstrating the immunological role of the probiotic Bacillus coagulans [ [117](#B117-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Another probiotic alternative is the use of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum proposed by authors Shin et al. (2019), which can enhance and stabilize the microbiota as well as other lactic acid bacteria [ [118](#B118-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The study used pigs (Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire \u00d7 in Aliquots of 50 mL/kg diet, 1.25 \u00d7 109 CFU/kg diet were fed to the experimental group. The most abundant phyla were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes in all diets; at the family level 19 different families of bacteria were found with significant differences in Prevotellaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, Sphaerochaetaceae, Spirochaetaceae, and Christensenellaceae, with a higher abundance in Prevotellaceae and Ruminococcaceae. Therefore, a higher abundance of Spirochaetaceae, Eryspelotrichaceae, Sphaerochaetaceae, and Christensenellaceae was found in the experimental diet and a lower abundance of Prevotellaceae. It was concluded that the microorganisms involved have effects at the immunological level and on the weight gain of the animals. On the other hand, the experimental diet helped in the development and integrity of the intestinal epithelium [ [119](#B119-microorganisms-11-02219)]. 5. Fish [120](#B120-microorganisms-11-02219), [121](#B121-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In 2020, global fish production from aquaculture reached an all-time high of 214 million tons, distributed among other marine products such as aquatic animals and algae [ [122](#B122-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Efforts in this industry are focused on increasing yields and decreasing costs associated with production by optimizing fish farming. Understanding the microbiome is also fundamental in fish, as it is involved in the development and efficiency of the gastrointestinal tract, resisting infections and maintaining the homeostasis of the organism [ [123](#B123-microorganisms-11-02219)]. With respect to the colonization and formation of the microbiome in fish, it is estimated that it starts in the eggs, by the influence of the surrounding water and in the content of the first food, initially giving discrepancies in the identification of native microbial communities, concluding that there are species-specific colonizing bacteria with which it starts [ [124](#B124-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [125](#B125-microorganisms-11-02219)]. 5.1. Salmon [126](#B126-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Its gastrointestinal system is composed of an esophagus, and a U-shaped stomach and intestine with the presence of pyloric caecae attached to it [ [127](#B127-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Although it is a carnivorous fish, it has been proposed to use diets from terrestrial plant sources to improve economic and environmental sustainability, causing farmed Atlantic salmon to change their diet. This has a direct impact on their microbiome, which exhibits variations based on whether their diet is carnivorous or vegetarian [ [128](#B128-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In samples of the digesta in the proximal intestine the most abundant in the digesta of the midgut and distal segment, and in a higher relative abundance in the distal mucosa. Represented as central microbiota of [129](#B129-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [130](#B130-microorganisms-11-02219)]. An experiment developed Y. Li et al., 2021 used in Salmo salar two diets; a commercially relevant reference diet (REF) and produced from black soldier fly (BSF) larvae, which is an important source of chitin. The BSF diet increased the relative abundance of Actinomyces, Bacillus, Brevibacterium, Corynebacterium, and Enterococcus, highlighting that the microbiota is modified by feed and/or feed composition to the salmon. In addition, the study points out that chitin can favor Bacillus bacteria, as they can produce chitinase [ [131](#B131-microorganisms-11-02219)], this being beneficial for the probiotic role of Bacillus bacteria against pathogens. [132](#B132-microorganisms-11-02219)]. A study conducted in salmon (Salmo salar) included two types of diets, the first based on soybean meal (30% SBM) and the second on fermented soybean meal (30% FSBM). The results showed that the Paracoccus genus was found in the SMB diet and the Acinetobacter, Shewanella, and Altererythrobacter genera in the FSBM diet. In addition, a higher amount of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Pediococcus of the phylum Firmicutes, was reported for both intestinal samples [ [133](#B133-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [134](#B134-microorganisms-11-02219)]. 5.2. Rainbow Trout [135](#B135-microorganisms-11-02219)]. It belongs to the Teleosts, so it shares characteristics in its intestinal morphology with other fish, presenting a stomach consisting of cardiac, fundic and pyloric regions, forming a J-shape, which by surface extension benefits enzymatic digestion [ [136](#B136-microorganisms-11-02219)]. It has been reported through sequencing that Cetobacterium, Yersinia, Ralstonia, Hafnia and Carnobacterium are the most abundant the intestinal mucosa and Yersinia, Serratia, the distal lumen [ [137](#B137-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In turn, other studies indicate that under a diet with insect protein directly related genera are Oceanobacillus, Bacillus, Paenibacillus and Cetobacterium within the intestines [ [138](#B138-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In the case of a central microbiota in Oncorhynchus mykiss it is difficult to describe since they encompass around 52 taxa in some studies, from among them we can highlight the classes study by et al., 2019 also employed the species Hermetia illucens, known as black soldier fly, to study how the intake of Hermetia illucens (Hi) meal in different 10); 20% (Hi 30% (Hi 30) can modulate the gut microbiota of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The results indicated the presence of the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, of which the most influenced by diet were Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria, which responded better to a higher proportion of Hi, except for Proteobacteria, which was decreased in the 20% and 30% treatments. In addition, the order of Lactobacillales, which at the genus level includes Facklamia, Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, and Pediococcus known as lactic acid bacteria (LAB), was favored Hi-containing diets. The genera Actinomyces, Brevibacterium, named at the species level in the diets with Hi. Consequently, the experimental diets increased BAL bacteria and butyrate-producing bacteria, and fermentable chitin was stated to be an element acting as a prebiotic [ [141](#B141-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [142](#B142-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [143](#B143-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Under this context, a study used rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) with treatments that included: vegetable protein as the control (CV); a fish base diet (CF); and diets containing protein from Hermetia illucens (H), known as black soldier fly, where 10% (H10), 30 (H30) and 60% (H60) of the vegetable protein was replaced by C. Also, poultry by-product meal (P) diets were used as another source of animal protein. That description is elaborated from parts extracted from slaughtered poultry being an economical feed, rich in nutrients and essential amino acids, which has been tested in species such as Sparus aurata [ [144](#B144-microorganisms-11-02219)]. P was used at 30% (P30) and 60% (P60) of the CV diet. Finally, a combination of 10% and 50% of H and P, respectively, (H10P50) was used. In all diets at the phylum level the populations present were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Tenericutes. With respect to the control, the diets with insect meal had a higher amount of Gammaproteobacteria, Enterococcus, and Actinomyces followed by a decrease in Pseudomonas. In addition, the occurrence of Erysipelothrix was reported compared to diets with CV or P. Therefore, it is concluded in this study that none of the diets had any negative effect. Diets that included insect meal helped to increase the diversity of intestinal microorganisms, with chitin being the prebiotic agent provided [ [145](#B145-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In summary, diets based on insect meal were beneficial and serve as a replacement for other types of animal protein, obtaining similar nutritional benefits in addition to providing a healthier microbiome. [146](#B146-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Its use in rainbow trout diets has not been studied and that is why the team of Wang et al., 2020, designed diets for trout containing: yam extract; a control and Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were found; the O1 treatment the population of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes decreased compared to the control. The opposite happened to the populations of Patescibacteria, which increased in the O3 treatment. At the genus Anaeroplasma, Candidatus_Saccharimonas, Ruminococcaceae, Lactobacillus, Rikenella, Lachnospiraceae, Bifidobacterium and Marvinbryantia were mentioned for a total of 10 phyla. Taking into account the changes between phylum populations, it was determined that Ruminococcoccaceae_UCG, Lactobacillus, Rikenella, Lachnospiraceae _NK4A136_group, Eubacterium, Bifidobacterium and Marvinbryantia had a lower relative population for the treatment with 0.1% yam extract, while the Lachnospiraceae _NK4A136_group and the [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group were reduced in the treatment with 0.2% extract. On the contrary, in the treatment with 0.4 extract Bifidobacterium, Marvinbryantia, and Candidatus_Saccharimonas increase. It is concluded that at the phylum level the treatment that produced more significant changes was O1 with 0.1% of yam extract, which greatly reduced the microbial diversity, fortunately this was recovered by increasing the concentration in the treatment with 0.4% of extract where at the genus level Bifidobacterium, Marvinbryantia, and Candidatus_Saccharimonas were favored and increased their population. Therefore, Bifidobacterium, Marvinbryantia, and Candidatus_Saccharimonas are beneficial bacteria that regulate homeostasis in the microflora, regulate metabolism and fulfill bactericidal function, treatment with 0.4% of yam extract being the recommended dose [ [147](#B147-microorganisms-11-02219)]. 5.3. Tilapia [148](#B148-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Is omnivorous and zooplankton detritus, and macrophytes [ [149](#B149-microorganisms-11-02219)]. It is part of the teleosts, consisting of a gastrointestinal gut consisting of the esophagus, Y-shaped stomach, and intestine [ [150](#B150-microorganisms-11-02219)]. It has been noted that Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria were the central phyla of intestinal microorganisms in tilapia, the most common genus being Cetobacterium within the inner, mid and hindgut [ [151](#B151-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Other studies focused on studying the stomach, midgut and hindgut segments, with sequenced luminal and mucosal samples, determining that the stomach section the [154](#B154-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Frequent streptococcal infection in fish leads to economic losses in the aquaculture industry, which is why there is a desire to find solutions to this infection [ [155](#B155-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) is reported to be the fish most susceptible to Streptococcus iniae (S. iniae) infection. In an investigation by Foysal et al., 2019, diets containing 0.5 g and 1.0 g/100 g of commercial garlic powder (TG1 and TG2, respectively) where fed. Fish were used that had been previously injected with bacterial suspension and placed in eight different aquaria: two for control without S. iniae (C1); and two for control with S. iniae, but without garlic supplementation (C2S). The last four were used for supplementation of the treatments with garlic and S. iniae in the mentioned proportions. In the control diets without bacteria, the following populations were found at the phylum level: Fusobacteria, Fusobacteriia, Fusobacteriales, Proteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Aeromonadales were found. The most remarkable result included the decrease in OTU counts for Vibrio (pathogen) with the 1.0 g garlic diet. Therefore, it was concluded that supplementation with 1.0 g garlic (TG2) was the most effective against S. iniae infection by improving the health status of fish [ [156](#B156-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [157](#B157-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [158](#B158-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Nile tilapia were used with a total of five isonitrogenous (315.65 g/kg crude protein) and isocaloric (18.7 MJ/kg crude energy) experimental diets. One control diet was used without sericite supplementation and the other four were fed with different concentrations of sericite (2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 g/kg). Experimental feeding in tilapia had an effect on the linear growth of bacteria, E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae in the stomach and intestine as sericite supplementation increased, implying that sericite administration may have bactericidal effects to buffer the aqueous pH and oxidation state. At a general level the experimental diet improved growth performance, digestive enzymes, and hematological and immunological parameters in fish [ [159](#B159-microorganisms-11-02219)]. 6. An Approach to the Functions of Microorganisms [160](#B160-microorganisms-11-02219)]. As ruminants are similar both morphologically and functionally, many of the microorganisms found are coincident in their digestive tract. One genus frequently observed in studies was Prevotella belonging to the phylum Bacteroidetes. It has been shown that it can prevent rumen acidosis in cattle by preventing the proliferation of acid-producing bacteria that disrupt digestive processes in cattle [ [161](#B161-microorganisms-11-02219)]. On the other hand, its colonization has been shown to decrease the relative abundance of Firmicutes such as the Ruminococcaceae family known for their fibrolytic activity [ [162](#B162-microorganisms-11-02219), [163](#B163-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Although Prevotella is present in many animals, its abundance has been increased in diets containing carbohydrates with a high level of dietary fiber as in studies in ruminants [ [164](#B164-microorganisms-11-02219)]. such as Holstein dairy cows and Hu lambs, as proposed by Wang et al. (2020) and Du et al. (2022), respectively. However, the diet proposed by Cremonesi et al. (2018) presented a decrease in the Prevotella genus, in the face of a diet with flaxseed as a dietary lipid supplement in alpine goats. This has been observed in diets that integrate a high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), impairing the ruminants [ [165](#B165-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [166](#B166-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Firmicutes bacteria have been found to be associated with protein and fat metabolic activity. Therefore, a diet with a high amount of protein and fat increases the proportion of Firmicutes bacteria [ [167](#B167-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In ruminant animals, bacteria of the species Ruminococcus flavefaciens belonging to the phylum Firmicutes are cellulolytic bacteria involved in the breakdown of cellulose in the rumen. This gram-positive bacterium is able to form a cellulosome, i.e., a multienzyme complex composed of four protein components (ScaA, ScaB ScaC and ScaE) and cellulose-substrate-degrading and Ruminococcus albus were found in diets containing fiber in studies described by Zhu et al., 2017 and Yusuf et al., 2017. Now, their decrease in the diet that included Piper sarmentosum described by Zhou et al., 2020, hints that bioactive compounds inhibit bacteria of the genus Ruminococcus, which has also been described by other authors who describe compounds such as tannins and essential oils exerting an antimicrobial role on gram-positive bacteria [ [170](#B170-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, present in the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants [ [171](#B171-microorganisms-11-02219)], showed an increase in its population under a diet containing flaxseed oil and vitamin E, described by Yoshimura et al., 2018, due to its role in the biohydrogenation process and the increase in compounds involved in biohydrogenation such as stearic acid (C18:0). As for the genus Bifidobacterium, of the phylum Actinobacteria, the diet that employed grape pomace in lambs [ [65](#B65-microorganisms-11-02219)], a food with high antioxidant power, presented an increase in its population, a result that agrees with other diets that have implemented antioxidants and that have presented an improvement in meat quality in terms of fatty acid content in lambs [ [172](#B172-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Bacteria of the genus Lactococcus, belonging to the order Lactobacillales, are considered within the group of lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB) [ [173](#B173-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Their presence was detected in Holstein Friesian cows in the diet presenting Ascophyllum nodosum [ The increase triggered in Lactococcus lactis and Lactococcus garvieae populations could be attributed to the fact that Ascophyllum nodosum, brown algae composed of polysaccharides, peptides, and nutritional compounds, can be used by the genus Lactococcus for the production of lactic acid. [174](#B174-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Its presence has been attributed to higher feed efficiency, higher milk production and its protein quality in dairy cows [ [175](#B175-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In diets proposed by Cremonesi et al. (2018) that integrated flaxseed in alpine goats, the genus Succinivibrio was increased, as was also seen before the integration of essential oils in diets [ [176](#B176-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [177](#B177-microorganisms-11-02219), [178](#B178-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [179](#B179-microorganisms-11-02219)]. In the diet proposed by Zhu et al. (2017), which used the fungus Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a positive effect on increasing Fibrobacter succinogenes was detected, as has also been seen with other cellulolytic bacteria in diets incorporating the fungus [ [180](#B180-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Similarly, diets used in goats [ [80](#B80-microorganisms-11-02219), [81](#B81-microorganisms-11-02219)], in treatments including Andrographis paniculata and Piper sarmentosum, respectively, showed a population increase in Fibrobacter succinogenes. In the former, possibly due to the increase in ruminal pH caused by ruminal bacteria, which subsequently provides benefits [ [181](#B181-microorganisms-11-02219)]. On the other hand, the decrease in Fibrobacter succinogenes populations after the inclusion of Piper sarmentosum suggests that the inhibitory causes of bioactive compounds, such as tannins, affect other gram-positive bacteria, as well as essential oils, which have been shown to inhibit the relative abundance of Fibrobacter succinogenes as with other metagenomic bacteria in the rumen [ [176](#B176-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [182](#B182-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The cause is due to the antioxidant power of polyphenols which promotes the growth of lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (Pozuelo et al., 2012). Similar results are observed in diets proposed by Kwak et al., 2021, which used a diet that included dietary soropholipids in chicks, and J. H. Park & Kim, 2020, which used an Achyranthes japonica in chicks where it increased the population of Lactobacillus. [183](#B183-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Diets used by Sun et al., 2020, that used sodium butyrate, showed an increase in the Prevotella genus in the cecum, where it is attributed that sodium butyrate could positively modify the mucosal walls of the small intestine decreasing the entry of carbohydrates and proteins to the cecum and increasing the population of bacteroidetes including the Prevotella genus. This genus has been described as helping the maturation of the intestinal mucosa by the production of acetate [ [184](#B184-microorganisms-11-02219)]. Similar result has also been seen in chickens upon the inclusion of sodium butyrate (800 mg/kg) benefiting bacteroidetes proliferation [ [185](#B185-microorganisms-11-02219)]. The study by C. Wang et al., 2019, used a basal diet with tributyrin which increased the population of Lactobacillus, while other studies report that the use of tributyrin decreases Lactobacillus populations by reducing intestinal pH due to the production of butyric acid in the hydrolysis of tributyrin [ [186](#B186-microorganisms-11-02219)]. with diets involving Hermetia illucens. In addition, it should be considered that the chitin present in insect meal reduces the abundance of Proteobacteria as it is a type of insoluble fiber analogous to cellulose found in vegetables [ [190](#B190-microorganisms-11-02219)]. [191](#B191-microorganisms-11-02219)], were reduced in their population in the diet incorporating garlic (Allium sativum) by Foysal et al., 2019, in tilapia, this is attributed to the beneficial bioactive qualities found in garlic improving the immune response [ [192](#B192-microorganisms-11-02219)]. 7.
