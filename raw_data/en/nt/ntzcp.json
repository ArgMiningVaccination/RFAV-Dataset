Acupuncture has been around for more than 5,000 years and is based on the premise that most diseases are the result of energy disruption. This Chinese system of natural healing is concerned with restoring proper energy flow throughout the body and to all organs. If all parts of the body are not functioning properly, pain, disease, organ malfunction and suffering are inevitable. Where does the interruption of energy flow occur? Energy flow can be disrupted by a) meridians/channels of energy throughout the body, just under the surface of the skin b) spinal column where vertebrae become misaligned or c) both. How can we detect if there is a blockage in energy flow? There are many methods, such as signs/symptoms, organ reflex points, instrumental findings, skin irritations, and advanced meridian graphing How are acupuncture treatments performed? After the skin points are determined, we can use one of over 30 methods of stimulation. The most common technique we use a more modern approach of Electrical Stimulation of the specific points. This technique is safer than using needles, there is no danger of infection, no blood, and the technique is virtually painless.
