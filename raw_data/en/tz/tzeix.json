The first dilution to be registered must be at least a 1 in 10,000 dilution of the starting material. The Scheme does not allow indications (description of diseases or conditions for which the product is used for). To qualify for the Simplified Registration Scheme, the products must: - be for oral or external use (excluding injections) - be sufficiently dilute to guarantee safety - make no therapeutic claims Under the National Rules Scheme there is no restriction on the first dilution to be authorised or the pharmaceutical form. You can claim that your product is used within the UK homeopathic tradition for the relief or treatment of minor symptoms and conditions which don't require the supervision of a doctor. You must submit data that demonstrates quality, safety and use within the UK homeopathic tradition and you must include details of your labelling and product literature with your application. How to apply For initial, variation and renewal applications, submit the [Registration Application Form](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1140769/Registration_application_form_for_a_THR.doc) with the required documents through [MHRA submissions](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/mhra-portal-register-to-submit-forms). You need to submit your application using the [eCTD format](http://esubmission.ema.europa.eu/ectd/). If you can't use eCTD you can use the Non-eCTD electronic Submissions (NeeS) process. Email [RIS.NA@mhra.gov.uk](mailto:RIS.NA@mhra.gov.uk) if you have any questions about submitting your application. MHRA usually takes 210 days to evaluate your application if we receive all the required documents and they are valid. Submissions through MHRA Submissions This UK national system is available and provides a simple and secure mechanism for exchange of information between applicants and the MHRA. The purpose of the system is to: - provide a secure method of communicating with regulatory agencies via one platform - allow submission of an application once to reach all required agencies - reduce the burden for both industry and regulators of submitting/handling applications on CD-ROM and DVD If you are a first time MHRA Submission user and wish to register an organisation/university or trust to manage multiple users on the system, follow the guidance and [register with MHRA Submissions](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/registering-to-make-submissions-to-the-mhra-from-1-january-2021).
