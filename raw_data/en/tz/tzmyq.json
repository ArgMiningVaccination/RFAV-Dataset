While resolutions encompass all aspects of health, improved energy levels is a predominant wish. Healthcare practitioners frequently see clients complaining of fatigue. Unless there is a detectable pathological illness associated with the fatigue, most allopathic medical doctors have little to offer these individuals. Alternatively, bodywork professionals typically rely on energy invigoration techniques, however, their effects are temporary. An Integrated Solution Integrative medicine borrows both from allopathic and complementary medical knowledge to offer state-of-the-art health solutions. When it comes to fatigue, integrative medicine successfully bridges the gap between healthcare systems. The approach to combating fatigue supplied by Lipid Replacement Therapy (LRT) is integrative medicine at its best. Components of LRT include: - Western science chronicles the body's energy manufacturing process on a cellular level. - Breakdown of the energy production system is confirmed by contemporary research. - Nutritional medicine provides a safe and proven method to repair the damaged structures responsible for energy production. Lipid Replacement Therapy Representing multiple medical perspectives, LRT is an effective, supplement-based, non-stimulant approach to naturally increase physical energy levels. LRT replaces phospholipids in cell membranes, resulting in improved function. Researchers Dr. Denham Harman and Dr. Bruce Ames have demonstrated that nutritional intervention can provide a healthier, more energetic life by supporting the health of energy-producing mitochondria. While many holistic healthcare practitioners have been schooled to examine how every system affects every other, looking at body dysfunction from a microscopic perspective is illuminating. Working backwards to understand energy's abundance begins with the question, \"What is energy and where does it come from?\" Basics of Energy Production Although numerous factors can cause fatigue, solutions to increasing energy levels are restricted by the available metabolic energy supply. Remembering back to biology class, the human body's principal energy molecule is adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP production occurs primarily in mitochondria, where an electrical chemical gradient is generated from the pumping of protons across its inner membrane (much like a battery). The charge builds, reaches a threshold and releases, providing the power to create ATP's high-energy phosphate bond, the foundation of our body's fuel. The ability of the mitochondria to host the production of energy relies on the health of its membranes. The membrane's lipid component allows it to remain fluid-like, ensuring an effective gradient for energy transfer. Oxidation by free radicals stiffens the membrane, making it less conductive, reducing energy levels. Spurred by age, disease, trauma and toxins, oxidative damage to the lipid membrane is considered to be the predominant cause of impaired mitochondrial function. Several clinical studies document the relationship between oxidation, membrane phospholipid loss, membrane damage and fatigue. Protecting cell membrane integrity is the key to enhancing cellular health, energy and metabolic efficiency. Nutritional Medicine Protects and Heals the Membrane Nutritional medicine is based on the premise that a healthy body requires the correct balance of foods, vitamins and nutrients. LRT is the actual replacement of damaged cellular lipids with healthy lipids. Essential for restoring membrane fluidity and function, LRT employs the following lipids to repair cell membranes: phosphatidylcholine - other polyunsaturated phosphatidyl lipids - glycolipids Clinical studies demonstrate a reversal of damage, restoration of cellular function and a return to normal energy levels when high concentrations of unoxidized, undamaged lipids are delivered to cells. LRT requires several additional nutrients to be effective. Unfortunately, individuals whose weakened digestive systems pass nutrients quickly are unable to reap lipids' benefits. In order to ensure lipids are utilized, nutritional medicine specifies the inclusion of essential fatty acids and probiotics (good bacteria) to nourish and balance the digestive tract, aiding nutrient absorption. While lipids rebuild membranes, and fatty acids and probiotics ensure their delivery, antioxidants can stop the damage from occurring. The inclusion of antioxidants, found in amino acids, vitamins and minerals, adds another dimension of protection by preventing phospholipid oxidation and free radical production. LRT supplies nutritional supplementation with the appropriate balance of lipids, fatty acids, probiotics and antioxidants to support, protect and heal our microscopic, energy-supplying structures. How You Can Help In addition to the short-term benefits of invigorating massage techniques, bodyworkers can offer a proven long-term solution to fatigued clients by suggesting or selling a nutritional supplement based on LRT. Incorporating this approach to membrane health can make the difference between clients dragging through the day as opposed to being vibrant and energetic. Integrative medicine's LRT combines the wisdom of nutritional therapy with a comprehension of biochemistry to end fatigue, making achievement of your clients' 2006 health goals possible.
