In this course, we will take a holistic and naturopathic approach to understanding and effectively treating the world's most common inflammatory joint disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Together, we will explore the RA's etiology, pathology, diagnosis, and conventional treatment. From this understanding, we will take a deep dive into assessing and addressing this condition through a naturopathic lens and model. Dr. Tim will highlight a variety of natural medicine options that may be part of the holistic toolkit when treating RA, including aromatherapy, nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, and gemmotherapy. Since every practitioner has their own strengths and proclivities with natural medicine modalities, this course will focus especially on the philosophical approach to addressing RA. That way, regardless of the tool that is used, the root cause of the disease may be addressed. Beyond gaining a deeper understanding of RA, this course is designed to inspire holistic thinking that can be applied to any clinical case going forward. If you suffer from RA yourself or wish to treat your patients via a more holistic and integrative approach, then this course is a must!
