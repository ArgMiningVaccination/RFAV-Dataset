Dealing with Stress Why do my problems keep coming back? The answer: Stresssss! Stress is the number one cause of a lot of health problems, from headaches to heart disease. What is stress? Borrowed from the engineering term used to describe physical forces on mechanical objects, stress in the body is described as a physical and emotional reaction to the world around us. Stressors can be obvious - like a loud jackhammer or a physically demanding job - or more subtle - like anxiety formed from years of worrying about a sick parent. Our bodies learn to cope with stress in different ways over time, and these coping mechanisms can create new, and sometimes worse, stresses. Chiropractic care can help interrupt this cycle and restore your mind, body and spirit to a more balanced place. Patients subjected to chronic stress - continued stress over a long period of time - were found to have higher rates of high blood pressure, diabetes, infertility, damage to immune response, damage to muscle tissues, and slower healing from injury. Stress has also been directly linked in both humans and animals to cardiovascular disease. There are three different forms of stress: - Chemical stress [nutrition, hydration, preservatives, pesticides, air quality, water quality] - Physical stress - Micro stress [repetitive stress disorder, the way you sit, sleep, stand, posture] - Macro stress [car accidents, falls, sports injuries] - Emotional stress [deadlines at work, school, family, financial worries, anxiety] How chiropractic, massage, acupuncture can help with stress! Chiropractic care for stress The most prominent symptom of chronic stress is prolonged muscle tension and contraction. Chiropractors can directly address this issue, as they work primarily with the spine, which is the root of the nervous system and the path through which nerve impulses travel from the brain to the rest of the body controlling all of your bodies functions. Chiropractic care can relieve the uneven pressures that result from prolonged muscle tension and contraction (stress), re-align your spine, and help relax your entire body, promoting better health. Acupuncture for stress [Acupuncture](benefits-of-acupuncture.php) is proven to impact a number of chronic health conditions, stress included. It is believed to stimulate the central nervous system to release natural chemicals that alter bodily systems, pain, and other biological processes. Evidence suggests that acupuncture impacts the body on the following levels: - Activation of your body's natural opioid system, which may help reduce pain and better sleep quality and quantity - Stimulate your hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which impact numerous body systems - Stimulate the conduction of electromagnetic signals, which may release immune system cells or pain-killing chemicals - Change the secretion of neurotransmitters and neurohormones, which may positively influence brain chemistry Massage for stress We've all walked away from a hands-on massage feeling relaxed and less stressed.
