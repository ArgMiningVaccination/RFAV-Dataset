To know how SonoVive works, It can help to Understand How Hearing Works. - First, soundwaves enter the ears, moving towards the eardrum. - The sound waves create vibrations on the eardrum, causing the malleus, incus, and stapes bones in the middle ear to vibrate. - Tiny hairs in the cochlea capture and interpret these vibrations, transforming them to electrical signs. Various sounds cause various kinds of vibrations and scales of oscillations, leading to different tones of sound and different intensities of sounds. - The auditory nerve carries electrical signs to the brain, where your brain translates this signals to sound. - Hearing is a complicated procedure involving complex systems in the ear. Also, the procedure itself is easy: sound waves cause vibrations, and vibrations get changed into electrical signals your brain can understand. It all takes place at the speed of light between your ears and your brain, helping you to hear sound. The most common cause of hearing loss is loud noise. If your ears are exposed to loud noises over and over again, it damages the interior ear, leading to permanent hearing loss and increasing the chance of tinnitus. Many of the leading causes of hearing problems consist of: - Loud noises, like noises from loud music, lawn mowers, or snow blowers - Earwax or fluid buildup, both of which actually block sounds from travelling in between your eardrum and inner ear - Punctured eardrum (punctured eardrums could be caused by infections, pressure, or putting objects in your ear) - Health problems, like diabetes and high blood pressure levels - Some people also experience hearing problems due to cancer, heart disease, strokes, brain injuries, or tumors. Other people get hearing problems due to genetics. Otosclerosis, for instance, is believed to be hereditary, and it leads to an irregular expansion of bone that prevents structures in the ear from working properly. Science Behind Hearing Before we dig in to the working of Sonovive and how it's a helpful Supplement for Hearing Loss, it is important to know about the working of the ears and how the hearing sense gets impacted.

Medication and surgical procedures provide great results. - Sensorineural Hearing Loss is the hearing impairment due to damaged auditory never or injuries in the inner ear.
