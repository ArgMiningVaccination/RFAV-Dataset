Thousands of people every year succumb to this particular disease and unfortunately, there has been no proper cure for it yet. Millions of researchers work day and night to find the perfect medication for cancer. Such a research led to the conclusion that inclusion of homeopathy can be an integrated approach to cure cancer. Homeopathy is an age-old therapy which works on the theory of treating like with like, which basically means a homeopath would use tiny doses of the substance which would cause the illness if given in large doses. Homeopathy is more of an organic way of treating diseases. Though there is no proof that homeopathy can actually cure cancer but people using this very way of treatment say that they feel better or more in control of the situation. Homeopathy as a cancer treating mechanism is more of a natural way which makes patients feel relaxed.

Usually, homeopathy is not the primary ground of treatment but it is used in combination with other approaches of treatment.
