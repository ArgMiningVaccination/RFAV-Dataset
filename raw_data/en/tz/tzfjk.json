The body weight gain, weights of adipose tissues, and adipocyte size were reduced in ECE-treated obese mice compared to those in high-fat diet-induced obese mice. ECE treatment also resulted in significant decreases in serum total cholesterol,triglyceride, and leptin concentrations, relative to concentrations in untreated obese mice.Furthermore, ECE significantly suppressed the elevated mRNA expression levels receptor , fatty subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese mice. In addition, ECE treatment inhibited 3T3-L1preadipocyte differentiation and fat accumulation. These results suggest that ECE amelioratedhigh-fat diet-induced obesity by downregulating expression of some lipogenesis-related genes diet, leptin, lipogenesis Obesity is a serious public health problem that results from the imbalance occuring when energy intake exceeds expenditure. Obesity is associated with numerous metabolic disorders, including hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, osteoarthritis, and certain types of cancer [Lei et al., 2007]. Many pharmacological approaches for the prevention and treatment of obesity have been suggested. Therapies for obesity include suppression of nutrient absorption and administration of drugs thatcontrol lipid utilization [Lee et al ., 2011]. However, current anti-obesity drugs have been reported to causeserious side effects including constipation, insomnia,vomiting, headache, stomachache, and heart attack [Bray, 2001]. In contrast, many oriental medicinal herbs are reported to be useful for the control of obesity,hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia without significant side effects [Khan al., 2004]. Elsholtzia ciliata (Thunb.) Hylander, a flowering plant that belongs to the family Lamiaceae, is a weed native toAsia. It has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of common cold, fever, headache, diarrhea, andedema in Korea, Japan, and China [Yeung, 1985; Ahn,2000]. E.ciliata has been seeds of this plant are sometimes used for flavoring food. E.ciliata contains an essential and rosefuran [Sohn et al., 1998]. It has been reported that essential oil extracted from E. ciliata inhibits lipid peroxidation [Jeong et al., 2005], and that a methanol extract of E. ciliata showed potent inhibitory activity against pancreatic lipase in a screen of medicinal plants for anti-obesity agents [Kim et al ., 2006]. However, the potential anti-obese activities of E .ciliata have not been studied in vivo until now. In the present study, the effects of a 70% ethanol extract of E. ciliata ( E. ciliata extract, ECE) on body weight, blood lipid levels, and fat accumulation in high-fat diet-induced obese miceand 3T3-L1 preadipocytes levels of lipid metabolism-related genes in adipose tissue were investigated. Materials and Methods Preparation of ECE. E. ciliata was purchased as a dried herb from Omniherb Co. (Yeoungcheon, Korea)and authenticated based ciliata 389 characteristics by the Classification and Identification Committee of the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM). The committee was composed of nine expertsin the fields of plant taxonomy, botany, pharmacognosy, and herbology. A voucher specimen (no. JA-108) was deposited at the herbarium of the Department of HerbalResources Research at the KIOM. The dried aerial parts of E. ciliata (100 g) were extracted twice with 70% ethanol using a 2-h reflux extraction, and the extract was concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was filtered, lyophilized, and subsequently stored at 4 oC. The yield of the dried extract from starting crude materials was 8.24% (w/w). Animals and diets . Male purchased from Daehan Biolink Co. (Eumsung, Korea) and maintained for 1 week prior to experiments. They were housed in an air-conditioned animal room with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 22\u00b11oC and 50\u00b110% humidity. Mice were provided with a laboratory diet and water ad libitum . All experimental protocols involving the use of animals were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and approved by the Committee on Animal Care of the KIOM. For induction of obesity, the mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (Rodent diet D12492, Research diet, New Brunswick, NJ) consisting of 60, 20, and 20% fat,protein, and carbohydrates, respectively, in accordance with previously published reports [Choi et al ., 2007]. Normal mice were fed a commercial standard chow diet (Orient Bio Inc., Seongnam, Korea). Orlistat and Bangpoongtongsungsan (BPT) were used as a positive control for treating obesity. The mice were randomlydivided into five groups (n=7) that were fed a normal diet (ND), a HFD, a HFD plus ECE (HFD+ECE), a HFD plus Orlistat, or a HFD plus BPT for 6.5 weeks. ECE or BPT were dissolved in normal saline and orally administered to the mice at 400 mg/kg/day for 6.5 weeks. The dose of ECE used in these experiments was determined frompreliminary dose-range experiments based on published report [Song et al., 2009]. Orlistat was administered to the mice at 15.9 mg/kg. The ND and HFD control mice were treated with vehicle (normal saline) only. Body weight and food intake were measured twice per week. Biochemical analysis of blood. At the end of the experimental period, the mice were fasted for 15 h priorto being sacrificed. The mice were anesthetized with ether, and then blood samples were obtained from eachmouse. Blood samples were centrifuged at 2000\u00d7g for 15 min at 4 oC, and serum was obtained and stored at 70oC before analysis. Serum levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol were analyzed with an automatic analyzer (Hitachi 7080, Hitachi Co., Tokyo, Japan). Theconcentration of was measured with mouse leptin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), according to themanufacturer's instructions. The absorbance was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Adipose tissue weight and histological analysis. After blood collection, the white adipose tissues (subcutaneous, epididymal, and retroperitoneal) were removed from mice and weighed immediately. For adipocyte staining, adipose tissues were fixed in 10% neutral formalin solution for 1 day and embedded in paraffin. All tissueswere cut at a thickness of 6 mm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To examine the sizes of adipocytes, the area of each adipocyte was measured in 20 cells ofrepresentative sections using light microscopy (Olympus BX51, Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) and an image analysis program (Image-Pro Plus 5.0, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Tissue was homogenized, and total RNA was isolated with the easy-BLUE total RNA extraction kit (Intron, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For cDNA synthesis, 1 mg total RNA was mixed with premix containing oligo (dT) primer and diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water to a finalvolume of 20 L and incubated at 45 oC for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by heat inactivation at 95oC for 5 min. Subsequently, cDNAs were amplified with gene-specific primers using the Taq PCR master mix (QIAGEN, Hilden, according to the instructions. The 20- mixture contained 1L cDNA, 10 L 2\u00d7 PCR master mix containing 1.5 mM MgCl 2, 0.1M of each primer, and water. After a 15-min preincubation at 94oC, PCR amplification was performed for 35 cycles under the following cycling conditions: 30 s of denaturation at 94oC, 30 s of annealing at 60oC, and 1 min of extension at 72oC. Gene-specific primers (Table 1) were designed using Primer3 softwarebased on gene sequences from the GenBank database. The relative expression levels of target genes were normalized using Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydro- genase (GAPDH) as an and differentiation. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were supplemented with g/mL streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 at 37oC. The cells were grown in 12-well plates to confluence. To induce differentiation, 2-day post-confluent cells were stimulated with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) plus 0.5 Yoon-Young et al. xanthine, 1 \u00b5M dexamethasone, and 10 \u00b5g/mL insulin for 2 days. After this induction, the cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and 10 \u00b5g/mL of insulin for 2days. Thereafter, cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS for 4 days. The medium was changed daily. Various concentrations of ECE were added along with thedifferentiation medium. On day 8, differentiation was assessed by morphological changes and Oil red O staining method. The cytotoxicity test was performed to examinethe effect of ECE on the viability of 3T3-L1 cells using MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a al., 1987]. Oil red O staining. The differentiated cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) andthen fixed with 10% formalin for 30 min. The fixed cells were stained with 0.3% Oil red O solution for 1 h. The cells were visualized by Olympus CKX41 microscope(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and photographed at 100\u00d7 magnification by Motic image Plus 2.0 program (Motic, Causeway Bay, Hong Kong). To quantify the intracellularlipids, the stained lipid droplets were dissolved with isopropanol (500 \u00b5L/well), and the absorbance was measured at 520 nm using spectrophotometer (BioRad).The optical density of fully differentiated adipocyte was taken as 100% of relative lipid content. Statistical analysis. Differences between groups were examined using an unpaired Student's t-test and analysis of variance (ANOV A) followed by Duncan's multiple range test. All data are presented as means\u00b1SE. Differenceswere considered significant when the p value was less than 0.05.Results Body weight, food intake, and food efficiency ratio (FER). The body weight, body weight gain, food intake, and FER of the mice in the three treatment groups are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 2. The final body weight of the HFD group was significantly higher than that of the ND group. However, the body weight of the HFD+Orlistat and HFD+BPT groups were decreased compared to the HFD group (Fig. 1). HFD+ECE mice showed 13% lowerTable 1.

Significant differences between the ND and HFD 391 body weight than HFD-fed mice (Fig. 1), and body weight gain was significantly decreased in the ECE- treated group relative to the HFD group (Table 2). Duringthe feeding period, food intake was higher in the ND group than in HFD group, but did not differ significantly between the HFD and ECE-treated groups (Table 2). TheFER was higher in the HFD group than in the ND group; however, in the ECE-treated group, the FER was significantly decreased compared to that in the HFDgroup (Table 2). Serum biochemical levels. HFD-fed mice showed significantly higher serum leptin levels than ND-fedmice. However, the ECE-treated group had lower serum leptin levels than the HFD group (Fig. 2A). ECEtreatment of HFD-fed mice significantly inhibited the HFD-induced increases in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels (Fig. 2B and C). Weights and histology of adipose tissue. To investigate whether ECE decreases adiposity, mice weresacrificed, and adipose tissues were removed andweighed.

Adipocyte sizes of all groups areshown in Fig. 4. Adipocytes in subcutaneous, retroperitoneal, and epididymal adipose tissues were significantly larger in the HFD group than in the NDgroup (Fig. 4A). ECE treatment significantly decreased adipocyte size relative to that in HFD-fed mice (Fig. 4A and B). Expression levels of lipogenesis-related genes in adipose tissue. To understand the mechanism involved inthe effects of ECE on lipid metabolism, the mRNAexpression levels of lipogenesis-related genes in adipose tissue were investigated (Fig. 5). Compared with normal mice, the HFD-induced obese mice had increased mRNAlevels of adipocyte markers proliferator- activated receptor fatty acid synthase (FAS) in the subcutaneous adipose tissue. However, ECE treatment significantly decreased the mRNA PPAR , FAS, and adipocyte fatty (aP2) their levels HFD group (Fig. 5A and B). 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation. When differentiating adipocytes were stained with the fat- specific oil red O at day 8, a fully differentiated state, a significant difference was observed between ECE-treated and non-treated control cells (Fig. 6A), indicating adipocytedifferentiation was suppressed by the ECE treatment. The result of oil red O quantification showed ECE significantly decreased lipid accumulation (Fig.6B). ECEat all tested concentrations did not affect the viability (data not shown). Discussion In the present study, ECE treatment of HFD-induced obese mice decreased body weight gain, inhibited adipose tissue accumulation, and reduced adipocyte size. ECE treatment of HFD-fed mice also reduced serumtriglyceride and total cholesterol levels. These results show that E. ciliata has potent anti-obesity and Fig. 5.

Relative changes (A) and representative bands (B) of PPARg, FAS, aP2 the ND and HFD groups: Significan hypolipidemic vivo . In addition, ECE treatment inhibits 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation. These results show that ECE effectively inhibits adipogenesis in vitro. Adipocytes in adipose tissue secrete a variety of proteins called adipocytokines including leptin, a key fat-secreted regulator of food intake and energy expenditure.Plasma leptin concentrations are usually positively correlated with adiposity (excessive body fat) and body weight changes in humans and rodents [Maffei et al., 1995]. In the present study, serum leptin levels were lower in the ECE-treated group than in the HFD group. Moreover, in the histological examinations of whiteadipose tissue, adipocyte size was significantly smaller in the ECE-treated group than in the HFD group. These results suggest that the reduced serum leptin levelsassociated with ECE treatment may be attributable to decreased fat accumulation in the adipose tissue as well as weight loss. PPAR , a lipogenic transcription factor predominantly expressed in adipose tissue, plays an important role in theregulation of adipocyte differentiation, lipid synthesis, and glucose homeostasis [Schoonjans et al., 1996; Rosen et al., 2000]. Lipogenic transcription factors regulate the gene expressions of enzymes involved in lipid synthesis such as FAS, aP2, the biosynthesis of aP2 is an intracellular fatty acid-binding protein that binds long chain fatty acids with high affinity [Coe and Bernlohr, 1998]. In the present study, ECE treatmentin HFD-fed mice significantly decreased the mRNA levels of lipogenesis-related genes such as PPAR , aP2, and FAS in the adipose tissue of obese mice. However, further study is needed to clarify the pharmacological mechanisms of ECE and to identify the active component(s) responsible for its anti-obese effects. In conclusion, the administration of ECE to HFD- induced obese mice significantly reduced body weightgain and adipose tissue weight, adipocyte size, and serumcholesterol, triglyceride, and leptin levels. These results suggest that ECE may prevent the development of obesity and hyperlipidemia in HFD-induced obese mice by downregulating lipogenic gene expression in adipose tissue. Acknowledgment.
