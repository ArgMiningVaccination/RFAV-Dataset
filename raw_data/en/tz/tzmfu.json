Abstract: Based on their antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties, pla nt-derived remedies and herbal products have been used since ancient times for wound an d burn cure as well as for treating chronic skin diseases like dermatitis and eczema. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymer nanofiber devices are currently fabricated using sophisticated engineering techniques. Such nanofiber structures have proven efficacious for the localized delivery of therapeutic agents for the treatment of wounds due to their unique physical-chemical prope rties such as large surface-area-to- volume ratio, high porosity, impr oved cell adherence, cellular proliferation and migration, as well as controlled in vivo biodegradation rates. The remit of this communication is to hi ghlight the methodology used for the fabrication of nanofiber mats and dres sings for the localised delivery of herbal products and plant-deriv ed ingredients for wound healing . Keywords: dressings; biodegradab localise d delivery botanical remedies; wound healing 1. Introduction Nonwoven nano-and micro-fibrous structures are becoming popular for a wide variety of applications such as biomedical devices, water filtration, prot ective garment materi al, electrical and optical applications, sensors a nd nanofibers reinforced composi tes [1]. Nanoscale materials also offer 371 AIMS Materials Science Volume 4, Issue 2, 370-382. potential usages for creating surgical devices like dressings a nd mats, cardiovascular stents, targeted- delivery of therapeutic agents, smart nanofibrous textiles for the management of lymphedema in cancer survivors. Nanofibres are known to mimic collagen fibril s in the extracellular matrix. Due to their smaller size in the range of 1-100 nm, nanoparticles can easily penetrate through cellular and microbial membranes and seem to exhibit differential uptake eff iciency in the target cells and injured tissue over normal cells. These attributes of nanoparticles not only enhance their permeation and retention effect in diseased organs and tissues but also improv e therapeutic potency, resulting in lower toxicity to normal cells or tissues [2]. The multifold pr operties of nanofiber devices, namely large surface-area-to-volume ra tio, high porosity, improved cel l adherence, cellular proliferation and migration, as well as controlled in vivo biodegradation rate promote their candidature for many biomedical applications as illustrated in Figure 1, including, scaffolds, drug delivery systems, implants, prosthesis and wound care [3-7]. Figure 1. Some potential biomedical applic ations of nanofiber structures . Traditional dressings consisted of cotton swabs and gauze dress ings for managing the chronic and highly exuding wounds over centuries. This practice subsequ ently led to the development of advanced wound and burn care dressings for the localised delive ry of therapeutic products and the modern nonwoven polymeric wound care scaffolds. Advanced antimi crobial wound care dressings or bioactive dressings are comprised of a wide variety of material s such as sodium alginate, ionic silver, chitosan, hydrocolloid, foam, gel or paste, molecular iodine, a nd have been marketed for several years. The fabrication of modern and novel biocompatible dressi ngs which incorporate bioactive wound healing materials like growth factors have been reported in [7]. Growth factors help to repair the damaged tissues and promote healthy cellular growth. Wounds often provide a favourable environment for the colonization of microbes which delay healin g. Incorporated anti-septic and anti- inflammatory agents and growth factors in modern dressings are slowly released at the wound surface and consequently minimize the opportunity for infection and promote healing. Because of its effectiveness against a broad range of micro-organisms, silver is included in many wound and 372 AIMS Materials Science Volume 4, Issue 2, 370-382. healthcare products. Silver nanoparticles release silver ions i n sustainable form to maintain desired concentration for antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and wound h ealing activity, while minimizing the toxic effect of silver. Silver accelerates healing of injur ed tissue through anti-microbial, anti- inflammatory, and anti-oxidant effect. The emergence of bacteri al resistance to silver and its potential to induce cross-resistance to antibiotics has also be en reported [6]. In cell culture experiments done with human mesenchymal stem cells, silver ions were found to be much more toxic than silver nanoparticles [7]. However, despite of these risks, the use of silver-containing dressings (e.g., Hydrofiber dre ssing, polyurethane foams and ga uzes) is increasing in wound and burn care products. Currently, the development of a variety of biocompatible dressings is the focus of attention of biomedical researchers [8,9,10]. These dressing s serve as vehicle for the promising delivery of wound or burn care ingredients or even allogenic ce lls which may provide a specific wound healing benefit. Further, th e dressing acts to maintain a locally moist environment needed for wound healing. Currently, the health care professionals encounter many problem s arising from patients suffering from injuries related to wounds, diabetic ulcers and burns [11]. Some wounds and burns damage the underlying structures like bone, muscle, tendon, art eries and nerves, which are deeper and need medical supervision to prevent infection and loss of f unction [12]. There are many ointments, topical gels and creams available in the market for treating wounds, but the most common disadvantage is the easily washing off or removal of the medica ment from the application site, which ultimately results in therapeutic failure. In addition, patient compliance is also a matter of concern, which can result in therapy failure. Several clinical studies a nd animal experiments demonstrate that nanofibers with diameter range of 50-1000 nm offer a great pote ntial in biomedical applications due to their large size area, high porosity and small pore size. No nwoven nanofibrous scaffolds or patches for wound care have shown to produce skin substitutes w ith optimal cellular organization, tissue proliferation and to r educe wound contraction [13]. Non-woven nanofibrous membranes o f both biopolymers and synthet ic polymers are useful for making wound dressings. Such mater ials decrease infection and m orbidity, since they fit well with pathophysiological and biochemical environment of wound healing [5,14-17]. cellulous , alginate and silk fibroin blended natural or synthetic active agen t containing silver nanoparticl es and silver salts, vitamins, antibiotics, curcumin, growth factors have been prepared [18-25]. The nanofi brous wound care dressings which promote cellular proliferation and subsequent healing have been reported in the literature [18-25]. Silver containing polymeric na nofiber dressings have been studi ed by several investigators [16,20,21,22,25]. Also, it has been reported by t he present authors that the chitosan/sericin composite nanof ibers have a promising potentia l for making wound care dressings due to their antibacterial properties [26]. 2. Localized Delivery of Botanical Remedies through Nanofiber D evices In the beginning of 19th century allopathic or synthetic medicines became the primary m ode of pharmacotherapy. Fortunately in the 21st century, there are many choices for treating communicable and non-communicable diseases with synthetic pharmaceuticals, a lternative remedies, natural health products (NHPs), nutraceuticals, and dietary supplements. In sp ite of the enormously rapid 373 AIMS Materials Science Volume 4, Issue 2, 370-382. development of new drug discoveries made in the field of allopa thy, plant-derived products, Ayurvedic remedies, and Chinese medicines still remain the majo r source of therapy in the developing countries. Many botanical products have shown anti-b acterial, anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. Emerging evidence suggests th at herbal remedies containing flavonoids, carotenoids, anti-oxi dants and anti-inflammatory ag ents not only decrease oxidative stress by scavenging free radical s, but also modulate gene and protein expression a nd thereby modify endogenous metabolic pathways and homeostasis, and consequently reduce the risk of cardiovascular and chronic diseases multifactorial in origin. Self-medication with NHPs and plant-derived therapies is becoming popular globally among the lay population. Accordin g to the WHO studies of 2008 [27], around 80% population in developin g countries relies on traditi onal plant-derived remedies, and such traditional medicines make around 25% market share of the entir e pharmacotherapy cache. In view of the high cost of synthetic drugs, the developing countries a re desperately looking for cost- effective alternative therapies for treating communicable and n on-communicable diseases, including wounds and burns as well as skin disorders like dermatitis and eczema. However, the safety and efficacy remain critical issues f or botanical healing agents us ed for treating communicable and non- communicable diseases, wounds, bur ns and diabetic foot ulcers. Biocompatible and biodegradable polymer micro- and nano-fiber d evices fabricated from nanofiber materials with sizes le ss than 1 \u00b5m are especially us eful in the field of medicine because these nanomaterials tend to replicate the molecular components of in vivo cellular and bimolecular environment. As mentioned earlier, the nanofiberous devices are beneficial for burn and wound healing due to their large surf ace-area-to-volume ratio, high p orosity, improved cell adherence, cellular proliferation and mi gration, as well as controlled in vivo biodegradation rates. The large surface area of polymer nanofiber mats not only allows increase d close interactio n of therapeutic agents and exchange of O 2 and CO 2 with tissues but also provides a mechanism for sustained relea se and localised delivery of plant-derived remedies, analgesics, a ntibiotics, and growth factors needed for burn and wound healing. In addition, the high porosity of n anofiber mats and dressings permits diffusion of nutrients and removal of waste products from the a pplication site. With all these attributes and functions, nanofiber devices promote wound and b urn healing. Owing to their multifacet properties, the nanofiber mats/dressings created fro m both natural and synthetic polymers have attracted the attention of surgeons, physicians, biomedica l researchers, and industry. Their envisioned potential applications are due to the optically tran sparent functional materials and nano- composites required for making scaffolds to grow stem cells, wo und healing dressings and mats, transdermal patches, targeted drug-delivery systems, tissue com patibility and biodegradability, improved cell adherence, and relatively lower manufacturing cos t [28-31]. Furthermore, as illustrated in Figure 2, tissue engineering techniques, namely nanofibrous polymer scaffolds used for stem cell growth and regeneration and of cells have proven succ essful in the wound and burn healing process [2]. To enhance the therapeutic efficiency, poorly solu ble synthetic drugs and plant-derived materials can be incorporated into nanofiber devices during the ir fabrication. On the basis of large surface-area-to-volume ratio and high porosity, the nanofiber m ats or dressings provide mechanisms for the localized sustained release of herbal products and plan t extracts in their nano-to-micro forms to treat burns and wounds as well as some inflammation-related chronic skin diseases, e.g., dermatitis and eczema. Several examples can be cited from the p ublished literature where nanofiber materials have been utilised for the localised delivery of plan t-based remedies for wound care. For instance, crude bark extract of Tecomella undulata blended with nanofibers of synthetic polymers 374 AIMS Materials Science Volume 4, Issue 2, 370-382. PCL/PVP with solvents chloroform/methanol has been reported for wound healing [32]. Bionanocellulose-based dressings are used for treating burns an d diabetic ulcers [33]. Aloe vera with biocompatible and biodegradable polymer PCL with chloroform sol vent was investigated for wound dressing [34]. Nanofibe rs of PCL and butanol, dichloromethane, hexane and methanol loaded with extraction of Centella Asiatica were utilized for topical drug administration and wound healin g [35]. Shikonin loaded nanofibers fabricated (DCM) and N,N- dimethylformamide (DMF) have been tried for wound cure and/or a topic dermatitis [36]. Also, for skin t issue engineering [37]. Figure 2. Diagrammatic representation of stem cells growth for wound hea ling. Furthermore, silk nanofiberous dressing fabricated from biomate rial silk have shown promising approach in the treatment of skin wounds [38,39,40]. A comparat ive study was done to evaluate the safety and efficacy of colostrum powder dressing with conventio nal dressing in the management of deep wounds. It was found that the colostrum dressing group not only required less number of dressing changes, but also show ed rapid healing, short healing time, and decreased pain compared to the conventional dressing group. T he results suggest that colos trum powder dressings are safe and effective for healing deep wounds, and may be used as an adjunc t therapy for the management of deep wounds [41]. Biopolymers cellulose is one of the most abun dant natural product that has attracted the attention of basic researchers involved in the bi omedical applications of nanomaterials [42-47]. Studies have shown that cellulose nanofi bers derived from wood and plants have widespread applications in pharmaceutical industry and bio medical areas due to their biocompatibility, physical and mechanical properties. These mat erials can be useful for drug delivery, make foams and aerogels as well as cell carriers, biomaterial s ubstitutes, and scaffold synthesis [48-51]. In addition, cellulose nanofibers are highly hydrophilic in nature and owing to their large surface area have a great potential for making woun d dressings [45]. 3. Fabrication of Nanofiber Structures Fabrication of polymeric nano/micro fibrous structures is an in creasingly emerging tissue engineering area that offers pot ential applicati ons in biomedic al sciences and biotechnology industry, 375 AIMS Materials Science Volume 4, Issue 2, 370-382. as well as for making scaffolds, stents, targeted drug delivery systems, implants and prosthesis. To produce these sophisticated devic es, electrospinning technique is a widely accepted method for making micro- to nano-scale structures using high voltage to cr eate an electrically charged jet of polymer solution or melt from the nozzle or needle [46-51]. Sin ce 1930, nanofibers have been produced from a variety of polymer s, both natural and synthetic [52]. It has been reported that compared to mechanical spinning processes, electrospininning is simple, economical and most versatile technique for produci ng nanofibres co-evaporation, and co -axial electrospinning have reported number of investigators [5,6,14,57-60]. Fabri cation of nanofiber structur es is illustrated in Figure 3. Figure 3. Different Techniques of electrospinning. Several authors have pointed out that a variety of nanofiber st ructures can be tailored by electrospinning multicomponent mixtures and post-modification f fabricated nanofibrous membranes. present, electrostatic spinni ng process is used for producin g nanofibers with diameters in the range of 10-100 nanometers. Similar techniques have been described in the literature by several investigators. Melt- or solvent-(s)-based polymer solution can be used for the fabrication of nano- and micro-fibers. The machine set up used for electrospinning and the fabrication of nanofiber s is shown in Figure 4. Furthermore, the various steps involved from polymer solution t o fabrication of nanofibers by the electrospinning technique are illustrated in Figure 5. With the application of high voltage, the polymer suspended in the solution or melt form results in the f ormation of charged polymer called meniscus, and consequently the high voltage electric field prod uces a Taylor cone meniscus that is formed during electrospinning process [61,62]. Further, the high electric field is strong enough to overcome the surface tension of Taylor cone to a moving jet and the resulting jet is solidified into micro- to nano-fibers after solvent evaporation. 376 AIMS Materials Science Volume 4, Issue 2, 370-382. Figure 4. ( a ) A s e t u p o f electrospinning device called nanospinner; (b) Schematic representation of elect rospinning process. Figure 5. Various stages of polymer solution to the f abrication of nanofibers. The nano- and micro-fiber struct ures offer a great potential fo r the localised delivery of herbal products alone or in combination with synthetic drugs. For syst emic delivery of products administered orally, the extremely high surface area of nanofib ers can enhance the absorption and bioavailability of poorly solubl e xenobiotics because the large surface area leads to increased dissolution rate in the gastrointestinal tract [63,64]. The in vitro release of drugs f rom the electrospun nanofibers composed of water-in soluble and nonbiodegradable pol ymer was found to be dependent on the drug: polymer ratio and fiber diameter [65]. There are a number of technical conditions that usually affect the nanofiber diameter, viz., viscosity of polym eric solution, voltage strength, distance between nozzle and fiber collector plate, flow rate of pump, no zzle diameter and fiber diameter [66]. 377 AIMS Materials Science Volume 4, Issue 2, 370-382. The relationship between fiber diameter and equipment nozzle di ameter calculated from experimental and numerical data is discussed in [67]. Another technique used for the fabrication of polymer-based mic ro- and nano-fiber structers is called airbrushing method shown in Figure 6. In this technique, the polymer solution is injected using compressed air to make nanofibers of a wide range of regu lar and irregular shapes onto a collector [68,69,70]. Figure 6. Set up used for making airbrushing nano- and micro-fiber structures. The airbrushing method is not only comparatively cost effective , but also is more safer than other electrospining techniques, since fabrication can be accom plished without using any type of high voltage equipment [71,72,73]. Furthermore, it's a easily a pplicable technique for creating the highly porous and lower modulus a ligned and loosely packed bund les of nanofibers using a larger array of polymer solutions at th e higher injection rates. It ha s been reported that airbrushing method can be applied for direct nanofib er deposition onto different t arget sites for surgical homeostasis, as surgical sealant, or for tissue reconstruction [74,75]. It ther efore appears that nanofiber dressings loaded with herbal products or plant-derived extracts could be potentially used for the localised delivery of botanical remedie s for wound and burn healing. Sometimes, the wounds may get inf ected and the infection may sp read systemically. Under such circumstances, the topical application of a therapeutic agent a lone may not be effective for wound treatment and the topical thera py may need to be supplemented w ith alternate routes of drug administration (e.g., oral, intravenous, intramuscular, etc.). This may constitute one potential limitation of the localized deliv ery of antimicrials and/or bot anical remedies in wound healing. 4. Conclusions Limited numbers of studies have been done for the localised del ivery of plant-based remedies for wound and burn care as well as atopic dermatitis using bioc ompatible and biodegradable dressings. Considering the meagre amount of work done in this a rea and the promising biomedical applications of drug-coated nanofiber structures, further well designed clinical studies are needed to determine the localised and controlled delivery of botanical an d synthetic products for wound and burn healing. The unique physico-chemical properties of nanofib er dressings and mats render them highly useful for several novel biomedical applications. The fi ndings of research studies discussed in 378 AIMS Materials Science Volume 4, Issue 2, 370-382. our review paper open a range of possibilities for further mech anistic studies of the localised and controlled delivery of botanical extracts as well as for creati ng possible alternative treatment of wound and burn healing. Plant-deri ved remedies and herbal produ cts have been used since ancient times for wound and burn cure as well as for treating chronic s kin diseases like dermatitis and eczema. In view of the high cost of synthetic drugs, the develo ping countries are desperately looking for cost-effective alternativ e therapies for wound and burn car e as well as dermatitis and eczema.
