The COVID-19 vaccines work with your immune system so your body will be ready to fight the coronavi - rus if you are exposed to it. 2 People of color are especially vulnerable to severe COVID-19.

Older people and those living with chronic medical conditions such as heart disease and diabetes are more likely to experience severe \u2014 even fatal \u2014 cases of COVID-19.
