The analysis was quantitative and qualitative andincluded investigation of both manifest and latent magazine story messages.Results: Manifest analysis noted that CAM was largely represented as a treatment for a patient with a medically diagnosed illness or specic symptoms. Discussions used biomedical terms such as patient rather than consumer and disease rather than wellness. Latent analysis revealed three themes: (1) CAMs were described as good butnot good enough; (2) individualism and consumerism were venerated; and (3) questions of costs were raised inthe context of confusion and ambivalence. Introduction Conventional medicine has been both the dominant form of health care in the Western world and growing in importance through the process of medicalization1since the Flexner Report in 19102and the development of antibiotic and antipsychotic drugs in the early part of the 20th century.3The process of medicalization has been both entrenched and ac-celerated up since the 1970s. 4Conrad argues that the essence of medicalization is denitional power or ''dening a prob- lem in medical terms, usually as an illness or disorder or using a medical intervention to treat it.''4The supremacy of the medical model is justied by its (supposed) reliance on posi- tivistic science.3,5 At the same time, however, there is no doubt that the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) has increased in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada and elsewhere in the Western world.6In 1993, Eisenberg and his colleagues7reported on the extent of the use of unconventional medicine in a national sample of the U.S. population. Massage, herbs, spirituality, religion, energyhealing, folk remedies, megavitamin therapy, commercialweight loss programs, lifestyle diets, and support groups were among the various therapies included in the national utilization survey. Thirty-four percent (34%) of their re-spondents had used one or more unconventional therapies. In 1998, Eisenberg and colleagues published the results of a national follow-up survey and found that the utilization ratehad grown to 42.1%. 8Eisenberg and colleagues8estimated that there were 629 million visits to CAM providers in 1997at an out-of-pocket cost of 27 billion dollars in the United States. The frequency of CAM practitioner visiting was higher than that of conventional medicine, and the out-of-pocket costs were about equal for the two types of health care. 9More recently, the National Center for Health Statistics found that 36% of Americans used some form of CAM, butwhen prayer and megavitamin therapy were included, 62%were considered to be CAM users. 9Notably, however, the majority of people did not ''confess'' to their allopathic physicians about their CAM utilization.9 The Canadian Community Health Survey indicated, too, that the frequency of CAM use (professional services only) among Canadians is signicant and has risen. During the1994-1995 time period, 15% of Canadians over the age of 12 used alternative medical treatment. 10The rate rose to 20% of Canadians in 2003.10The rates of CAM utilization have been estimated to be between 10%11and 20%12in the United Kingdom. It is thus clear that a sizable minority of people in each of these countries uses some type of CAM. Determining what tocall CAM is, however, challenging; ''alternative, comple- mentary, holistic, unorthodox, unconventional, non-scientic, some of the options. 13However dened, CAMs, their utilization, and deciding what forms of ''treat- ment'' to include in these statistical estimates are prob- lematic.14There are areas of incommensurability among Department of Sociology, Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.THE JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE Volume 16, Number 1, 2010, pp. 125-130\u00aaMary Ann Liebert, Inc. DOI: 10.1089 =acm.2009.0124 125 different CAMs including (1) the lack of shared principles, (2) disparate theories and goals of the various CAM practices, (3) the (sometimes) inclusion of CAM within conventional med- icine, and (4) porous and changing boundaries between dif-ferent types of CAM. 15There have been a number of typologies for distinguishing among CAMs. One, by Gold- stein,16suggests that the following core beliefs give CAM its coherence; (1) holism (e.g., mind-body unity), (2) vitalism (a life force that promotes healing), (3) an emphasis on spiri- tuality and =or religion (often using secular language such as therapeutic touch), (4) the notion that health is more than theabsence of symptoms, (5) the idea that health can only be gained through hard work and is possible even in the presence of disease, and (6) the belief that the healer is also a partner. Many of the treatments included in the various types of CAM do not require consultation with a professional. Others require consultation with health care providers such as chi-ropractors, naturopaths, homeopaths, and =or acupunctur- ists. CAMs vary in cost. Some, such as prayer, are free. Many others, such as commercial weight loss diets, megavitamins,and the services of professional practitioners can be costly.Depending on which CAMs are included, there are different levels of utilization. Utilization rates of the disparate types of CAM are undoubtedly associated with different social classand other sociodemographic variables. Many studies have found a positive relationship between education level, in- come, and CAM use. 10,17In addition, women, whites, and more highly educated and younger people are more frequent users of CAM.17-19Spiritual healing appears to be associated with nonwhites.19 CAM utilization rates appear to be increased by the presence of a serious chronic or life-threatening illness.20-22 For instance, studies have found utilization rates of between 1 in 10 and 2 in 3 in cases where people have been diagnosedwith cancer. 22Whether or not disappointment with con- ventional medicine plays a signicant role in CAM use is empirically unclear,23,24nor has the argument that people choose CAM to assert personal control been widely sup- ported.19Social networks appear to have an impact on CAM choice.13 In Western societies, there is evidence of the sustainability of the medicalization thesis at least in the near future.3,4,25,26 At the same time, strong arguments have been made for the increasing use of CAM and for the integration of CAMs intomainstream medical practice. 27Critical assertiveness among health care consumers and a greater willingness to question the safety and efcacy of conventional or allopathic medicineboth play a role in this trend. 28Moreover, various CAMs are presently being included in medical school curricula and used by conventional doctors,3,26as adjuncts to and inte- grated into conventional treatments. There are a number of new peer-reviewed scientic journals focusing on CAMs.28 Clearly there is evidence of change in the areas of CAM and conventional medicine. Media Analysis One of the possible contributions to CAM understandings, use, and its increase may be the mass media. Mass media often reflect and reinforce a system ''of values, beliefs andmorality that supports the established order and the class interests that dominate it.'' 29Health and social policies related to diagnosis, treat- ment, prevention, health promotion, research directions, and supportive services, among other things, are related to media portrayal.29The research will examine the framing of stories regarding CAM where framing is thought to establish the boundaries regarding what and how topics will be discussed by selecting some ''aspects of a perceived reality.''30More simply, frames are ''like the border around a picture that separates it from the wall.''30 Mass Media and the Portrayal of CAM Available research is scant. There were only three articles found on the portrayal of CAM in the mass media. Doel and Segrott31have examined issues in regard to the portrayal of CAM in health and lifestyle magazines designed specicallyfor women. 31They argue that the focus in these magazines is on the ways in which CAM may be used as a part of women's quest for ''well-being'' and as a reflection of womentaking personal responsibility as increasingly ''smart'' and discerning consumers. They also argue that specic diseases have been replaced with a generic ''dis-ease'' with life, so thatthe reasons to use CAM have no limits. 31 Kirkman32undertook an interpretive content analysis of CAM, in New Zealand women's magazines. She found that both conventional medicine and CAMs were presented inmagazines with approximately equal frequency and found a blurring of boundaries between orthodox practitioners and alternative therapists. 32 The purpose of this research is to analyze and describe the portrayal of CAM in popular mass media magazines with circulation rates of greater than 1 million. Magazines used forthis article include Better Homes and Gardens *,Business Week *,Good *,Time, and U.S. News and World Report . Six (6) of these magazines are marked with an (*) to indicate that their audiences are largely female. The others are directed to general audiences. Methods Sample =population This study was based on allfull-text articles (without graphics) on the topic of CAM in the English language mag-azines with circulation rates of more than 1 million and available in Canada and published in Canada or the United States from 1980 to 2005 . It also included Maclean's magazine because it is the highest circulating national newsmagazine available in Canada even though its circulation gures do not reach 1 million. The Reader's Guide to Periodicals Index was used to locate allarticles indexed under complementary and =or al- ternative medicine and any internal links mentioned. These included acupuncture, chiropractics, naturopathy, holisticmedicine, home remedies, alternative medicine, and home- opathy. These years were selected in order to provide enough data over a long enough period of time to avoid the bias of theselection of 1 year only when a particular event, such as theannouncement of new ''natural'' treatment product might occur. The time period was also selected in order to accrue a sufcient number of articles for analysis. It must be noted thatmeanings may have changed and over time in an impercep- tible manner and that we may have inadvertently excluded126 CLARKE ET AL. some articles because of our specic search strategy. For ex- ample, searching for articles on natural medicine may have resulted in a different series of stories. It is important to note that there were many other articles on CAM in mass maga-zines but they were excluded because the circulation rates of these magazines did not reach 1 million. Data analysis Initially, all articles were read to categorize them for man- ifest, surface, or intended content, and as focusing on one type of CAM or another, mentioning a disease or not, referring to users as patients or consumers, associating CAM utilizationwith disease or wellness, mentioning celebrity, social class, or gender among other things (a full copy of the manifest coding categories is available from the authors). 33,34Subsequently, for the latent, subsurface, or unintended analysis, all articles were read and summarized as to their framing of CAM, topics of discussion, and types of attitude toward CAM.35 With qualitative data analysis concerns such as reliability and validity become credibility, transferability, dependabil- ity, and conrmability.36These criteria were attended to in the data analysis. Results Manifest analysis There is a growth in the numbers of articles over time. There were 9 articles found on the topic between 1985 and1994 and 28 found between 1995 and 2004 under the terms CAM. Table 1 indicates the types of illnesses and diseases dis- cussed in the CAM articles and the frequency with which they appeared. CAM was usually discussed in the context of specic symptoms and diseases. Table 2 indicates how often articles used the terms ''patient'' and ''consumer.'' CAM is referred to in the context of a biomedical model through the deployment of the term''patient,'' with more than three times the frequency as theterm ''consumer.'' Table 3 indicates the gender to which the articles were directed. In this population of articles, gender neutralityprevails. Eight-one percent (81%) of the articles were directed at either both men and women or neither men nor women. Table 4 indicates how often articles were focused on dis- ease, wellness, or both. Again, most articles focused on dis- ease or disease in addition to wellness. Only 11% described CAM solely in respect to wellness, prevention, or holism. A very small minority of articles described individuals and among these, there were very few references to income or occupation or other indices of social class or status. Latent analysis Theme 1: Medicalization persists. The rst signicant theme in the latent analysis is the persistence of a biomedical perspective in articles about CAM. Six aspects of this follow. 1. Good but not good enough An underlying and consistent theme in many articles that discuss CAM is that it is good, but not good enough. That is,rather than being an alternative, CAM is best thought of as complementing and being used in conjunction with con-ventional medicine. Following are a few quotations taken from a variety of articles and illustrating this theme: (1) ''Naturopathic doctors (NDs) can provide add-on treatmentif you're being seen by an MD for a chronic health conditionsuch as diabetes or heart disease'' (10; 48);* and (2) ''There is one point on which doctors and reputable alternative ther- apists agree: Natural therapies should be used in conjunctionwith, but not instead of, conventional medicine'' (63; 38). 2. Potentially dangerous Readers are frequently warned to beware of CAM. Poten- tial users are advised of its putative dangers. ''Skeptics worry that the new permissiveness could hurt consumers by en-couraging useless or even dangerous medical practices'' (32;Table 1.Conditions Treatable by Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatment for:No. of times appeared in article Back =joint muscle pain 10 Headaches =migraines 8 Bites =stings =burns 7 Arthritis 5 Heart disease 4Nausea 5Premenstrual syndrome =menopause 5 Respiratory (asthma, chronic lung disease) 5 Cancer 4Indigestion 4 Substance abuse 4 Congestion 3Earaches 3Irritable bowel syndrome 3 Skin conditions 3 Tooth =mouth 3 Acquired immune deciency syndrome 2Allergies 2 Colic 2 Depression 2Diabetes 2 Erectile dysfunction 2 Insomnia 2Overeating =weight loss 2 Sore throats (laryngitis) 2 Carpel tunnel 1 Constipation 1Cradle cap 1Diarrhea 1 Hemorrhoids 1 High blood pressure 1High cholesterol 1 Malarial conditions 1 Multiple sclerosis 1Parkinson disease 1Reynaud syndrome 1 Scurvy 1 Stroke 1 *Numbers after quotations in the data analysis in this section all refer to magazine and page numbers from the data bibliographyavailable from the rst author.PORTRAYAL OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 127 56). A frequently expressed fear was that CAM would become the primary source of health care: ''Conventional wisdomholds that the only real danger of alternative medicine is that it might keep you from seeing your primary physician, in- creasing the risk that a serious illness will go undiagnosed''(18; 62). ''Stick with mainstream medicine for any condition that's life threatening and any ailment easily controlled with well-tailored medication (such as diabetes)'' (18; 62). 3. Lacking evidence CAM is said to lack research and empirically based evi- dence regarding safety and efcacy. One doctor describes theresearch that has been done on CAM therapies as ''hokum'' (18; 60). CAMs are described as unsafe and ineffective be- cause they ''defy basic laws of chemistry and physics or runcounter to commonly held notions of anatomy'' (48; 56). 4. Should be used along with conventional medical care CAM portrayal also includes a notion that it should only be used in addition to conventional medicine. As one article states, ''We should recognize that modern medicine or tradi-tional home remedies may be valid at different times for dif-ferent reasons, and there will be times when both can work together toward the goal of healing'' (57; 67). For example, one article explains that, ''in some cases, the best method is acombination of East meets West'' (48; 66). In another article the universe is described as ''one big medicine cabinet'' (51; 77). However, U.S. medicine was still considered the best. Peopleare advised that ''the next time you come down with some- thing that doesn't require surgery\u2014we'd never leave the States for that\u2014consult your atlas'' (51; 77). 5. Against the advice of conventional doctors The popularity of CAM is said to have grown despite general resistance from allopathic practitioners. In otherwords, ''in the spirit of if-you-can't-lick-'em-join-'em, scores of doctors and hospitals across the country are exchanging their traditional adversarial position for one of cooperation''(76; 69). Few doctors were presented as enthusiastic about this integration. One exception follows: ''Today, in large part thanks to Harvard-educated Andrew Weil, M.D., 58, and amovement he helped forge, integrative medicine\u2014an amal- gam of drugs and surgery, Western medicine, and alterna-tive treatments from acupuncture to homeopathy\u2014is one of the fastest growing health disciplines'' (13; 156). 6. CAM is to be used after conventional medicine has been tried Individuals are encouraged to treat themselves with CAM only when conventional medicine does not work. For exam-ple, after being diagnosed as human immunodeciency virus-positive, one man began ''investigating alternative therapies almost immediately'' (63; 35). ''Now 48, Mountfordcredits a range of alternative treatments, from nutritional counseling to acupuncture and herbs, which helped to alle- viate the side-effects of AIDS drugs and to control his pain''(63; 35). In another example, after Rosario Farro discovers that she has breast cancer for the second time in 8 years, she refuses to undergo radiation and chemotherapy ''convinced that theywould do more harm than good'' (63; 37) and decides to take ''massive doses of vitamins and minerals under the supervi- sion of a physician interested in holistic health'' (63; 37). Theme 2: Individualism and consumerism are venerated. The second major theme is that CAM utilization reflects in- dividual choices made by patients or consumers who aredescribed as free and able to determine what they themselves think is best. In this context, individual choice may be glo- ried and the personal characteristics of CAM users pre-sented as particularly admirable. 1. Holism and individualism One of the chief appeals in the positive portrayal of CAM is the idea that patients =consumers are not just bodies be- cause ''their goals are to prevent illness, treat the whole person, and help the body heal itself via natural means'' (10;48). This view is said to acknowledge the uniqueness of each individual. ''Homeopaths often individualize treatment, matching remedies to a patient's particular pattern ofsymptoms'' (48; 56). 2. Individuals should have free choice The individual is described as an active consumer with ''more health care options'' (63; 34) to choose from. Many articles contained guides to educate the modern health con-sumer. One article begins: ''Ready for the plunge? This guidewill give you an informed insider's perspective'' (67; 29). 3. Health is the responsibility of the individual CAM articles also accentuate that the individual is re- sponsible for a healthy life and lifestyle and for choosing CAM to promote these ideals. For example, ''a cornerstone ofcare at the Marino clinic is that patients must actively work to help themselves, including altering diet, quitting smoking and getting more exercise'' (46; 135).Table 2.Use of Terms: Patient Versus Consumer AudienceNo. of articles that use terminologyPercentage of total (%) Consumer 4 24% Patient 13 76%Total 17 100% Table 3.Mention of Gender of ''Patient'' in Article Gender No. of articles Percentage of total Female 3 8% Male 4 11%Both =neutral 30 81% Total 37 100%Table 4.Focus of Article: Disease Versus Wellness Focus No. of articles Percentage of total Disease 20 54% Wellness 4 11% Both 13 35%Total 37 100%128 CLARKE ET AL. Theme 3: Costs. There is little discussion of the nancial aspects of CAM. In some articles, allopathic medicine was described as the superior form of medicine. CAM was thus reserved for the rich because CAM was usually not covered byhealth care insurance but was an out-of-pocket expense. In other articles, CAM was described as providing a cheaper alterna- tive for (uninsured) individuals from lower socio-economicpositions. It was noted that some insurance companies have begun to cover CAM in an effort to cut costs, ''Intrigued by the possibility that patients might nd real relief withcheaper therapies, insurers are beginning to cover certainalternatives'' (56; 1 of 2). 1. People pay for CAMs themselves Despite the move toward some insurance coverage, most people are portrayed as paying for CAM. Thus, CAM is not a choice for individuals from all socio-economic positions. Thecost of CAM is noted in the following example, ''Be prepared to pay your bill'' (80; 64). Despite the cost, ''these days, middle-of the road Americans like Trembour are turning inincreasing numbers to such unconventional approacheswhen they feel sick'' (65; 106). 2. Prot motive of CAM sometimes questioned Several articles included a critique of the prot orientation of CAM as compared to conventional medicine. The idea of a competition between conventional and CAM medications issometimes encouraged. ''Conventional medicine is looking more closely at the competition'' (48; 56) and critiqued. ''The bottom line is that the manufacturers of homeopathic rem-edies are raking in hundred of millions of dollars a year for products that may not be more effective than ordinary tap water and are probably not as pure'' (70; 1 of 2). Discussion The rst point to be emphasized is that there were more than three times as many articles on various CAMs in the second decade analyzed as there were in the rst (1985-1994, 1995-2004). This growth in the frequency of articles reflectsthe growing utilization rates for CAM. However, ongoing ambivalence was demonstrated by the fact that CAM was usually contextualized by perspectives such as disease (anidea pertinent to the biomedical model) and patients ratherthan wellness and consumers (relevant to CAM). Both men and women tended to be addressed in these stories. In the latent analysis, CAM is presented as good but not as good as conventional medicine. CAM was sometimes de- scribed as devoid of scientic value, as potentially dangerous unless used under the jurisdiction of an allopathic practi-tioner or for trivial health concerns. Those who choose CAM are described as differing from others because they are es- pecially concerned about their health and well-being and assubscribing to the belief that CAM is uniquely designed for the whole of the body, mind, and spirit. Individuals are portrayed as having the right to choose a healthy lifestyle,which is said to include the use of CAM when this is desired,when faced with a serious illness, or when conventional medicine does not work. There is little mention of the social or economic constraints involved in using CAM. However, what was included was contradictory. Sometimes conventional medicine was de-scribed as too expensive. Yet, for those covered by insurance it was CAM that was costly because CAM was seldom covered. In addition, there was some discussion about the possibility that CAM providers and companies manufacturing treat-ments were nancially motivated rather than altruistic, as conventional medicine was said to be. These ndings underscore the continued valorization of medicalization as the dening perspective regarding the good and the bad in health care. CAM is described as holistic care not because it takes into consideration the individual inthe context of family, friends, neighborhood, work, church,or any other aspect of social life but because it emphasizes the glorication of the individual who is seen not only as a biological organism, as is the tendency of conventionalallopathic medicine, but as a complex whole, composed of body-mind-spirit. This individualizing strategy may be particularly impor- tant in a situation in which medicalization is, as Conrad 4 argues, being advanced less as a result of the interests ofthe medical profession, as it was in the past, and more in theinterests of free enterprise and capitalism, particularly thepharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. 25The under- scoring of the image of the individual as an active consumer and the appeal to freedom of choice represent an indirect wayof buttressing capitalism and both conventional medicine and CAM. Individualizing is also reflective of the variety of rights movements, including other health and tness movements. Goldstein suggests that there are signicant economic for- ces behind the growth of CAM. 25Among the major economic beneciaries on the global stage are medical associations, thepharmaceutical industry, Health Maintenance Organizations, insurance companies, media conglomerates, and Internet providers as well as the interests of political, bureaucratic andnew social movements' actors and interests. 25These organi- zations have all been growing along with the expansion in CAM and certainly stand to gain as CAM becomes more widely accepted. Conclusions This media analysis suggests that there is a sort of battle going on in the public sphere of media portrayal. On the one hand is the portrayed assumption that allopathic medicalcare is itself the ''gold standard'' for thinking about bodiesand health. However, the biomedical model maintains a shaky position of dominance. On the other hand, there is a competing idea of the benets of CAM for the new inde-pendent and ''whole'' person of the future. Further research on this topic should compare media in different jurisdictions and follow the changes in media representation as theprevalence rates for CAM utilization change, and, most likely, increase.
