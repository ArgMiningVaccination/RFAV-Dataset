Whole-person health \u2014optimal wellbeing in mind, body and spirit \u2014reflects our heritage and guides our future. Adventist Health Portland is part of Adventist Health, a faith-based, nonprofit health system serving more than 75 communities in California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington. Community has always been at the center of Adventist Health's mission\u2014to share God's love by providing physical, mental and spiritual healing. The Com muni ty Health Nee ds Assess ment is on e way we put ou r faith- based mission into act ion. Eve ry three years, we co nduct this assessment with our com munity . The proces s involve s input and representati on fr om al l: communit y , minority , elderly and othe r underserve d populations. We u se the Communi ty He alth Nee ds Assess ment to achi eve the se goal s: Learn about the community's most pressing health needs Understand the health behaviors, risk factors and social determinants that impact our community's health Identify community resources and prioritize needs Collaborate with community partners to develop collective strategies Partnering with our communities for better health While conducting the Community Health Needs Assessment we solicited feedback and input from a broad range of stakeholders. Contributors to the process included these partners: Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborate Multnomah County Public Health Department Portland Adventist Community Servicesiii Data Sources The assessment drew from publically available secondary data sources, as well as from nationally recognized data sources. We collected data on key health indicators, morbidity, mortality, and various social determinants of health from the Census, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Community Commons, County Health Rankings and various other state and federal databases. The Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborative includes 15 hospitals, 4 health departments and 2 Coordinated Care Organizations in the Clackamas, Multnomah and Washington counties of Oregon and in Clark County, Washington. This unique public-private partnership serves as a platform for collaboration around health improvement plans and activities that leverage collective resources to improve the health and wellbeing of our communities. Executive Summary One of the goals of any CHNA is improving the preparation process, data gathering and addressing gaps in our previous CHNA. We believe we have addressed the short falls with this document. We have also continued our membership with the Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborate and we continue to use the CHNA generated by that organization as a major supplement to our own CHNA. The following bullet points are the major findings of this report. Since our 2013-2016 CHNA it has been observed that the concentration of our patients, either receiving charity care and Medicaid, has increase by a substantial amount in a number the zip codes in our service area. Black/African Americans experienced the greatest number of disparities with the highest level of concern relative to other communities of color. Chronic diseases and conditions \u2014such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and arthritis \u2014are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems. The suicide rate is increasing in Oregon Diabetes is becoming more common in the United States. Diabetes and obesity have more than doubled among Oregon adults since 1990. Obesity is the number two cause of preventable death in Oregon and nationally, second only to tobacco use. Obesity prevalence among Oregon adults has risen dramatically in the past two decades. During 2014, heart disease was the second leading cause of death in Oregon. In 2014, COPD was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. and Oregon. 10.8% of adults and 7.8% of children in Oregon had asthma in 2011. Allergies are the sixth leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S. Up to one-third of cancer cases in the United States are related to excess weight or obesity, physical inactivity, and/or poor nutrition.iv Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in both men and women in the United States. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. While mental disorders are common in the United States, their burden of illness is particularly concentrated among those who experience disability due to serious mental illness (SMI). Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United S tates and is the fifth leading cause among people aged 65 years and over. In 2013, suicide was the second leading cause of death among persons aged 15-24 years, the second among persons aged 25-34 years, the fourth among person aged 35-54 years, the eighth among persons aged 55-64 years, the seventeenth among persons 65 years and older, and the tenth leading cause of death across all ages. People with mental health disorders are more likely than people without mental health disorders to experience an alcohol or substance use disorder. The higher percentage of people who were current illicit drug users in 2014 than in prior years appears to reflect trends in marijuana use. Nonmedical pain reliever use continued to be the second most common type of illicit dru g. In 2009-2010, Oregon was one of the top ten states for rates of drug-use in several categories. By 2013, the number of individuals receiving treatment had increased by more than 107% compared with 2004. From 2010 -2014, there was an approximate 2.6-fold increase in the number of reported acute hepatitis C cases from 850 to 2,194 cases, respectively. Chlamydia is the most common reportable illness in Oregon. More than 13,000 cases occurred in 2012. Oregon's rate of early syphilis infections greatly increas ed during the last eight years. There were 0.7 cases per 100,000 people in 2007 and 10.5 cases per 100,000 people in 2014. This represents a 1500% increase. Increases continue during 2015. About 110,000 more Oregonians were poor in 2014 than in 2009 at the end of the Great Recession. Multnomah County child poverty prevalence is higher for all communities of color than nationally. Between 2014 and 2015, homelessness among individuals increased in 19 states. The largest increases were in New York (3,492 more people), California (2,391), Oregon (1,473), Washington (1,136), and Illinois (802).v A review of the results of the community surveys shows similar concerns. Those concerns are as follows: Behavior/Mental Health Access to Affordable Health Care Life Style Concerns surrounding: Drug and Alcohol Abuse Health Eating Habits Obesity Lack of Exercise Social Determinates of Health Housing Homelessness vi Prioritization process Prioritizati on o f the needs of our communi ty came fro m the cooperati on o f our Hospita l Col laborative group .

Services & Programs Our network of services is here to serve all of our communities' health needs. Our emphasis on wellness and whole -person care means that we don't just treat our patients after they get sick, we want to keep them healthy. Adventist Health Medical Group Arthritis and Bone Care Cancer Care Cardiac Care Diabetes and Endocrine Care Diagnostic and Imaging Services Family Birth Place Home Care Hospitalist Service Internal Medicine JobCare Laboratory Mental Health Nutrition Orthopedics Palliative Care Pastoral Care Primary Care/ Family Medicine Pulmonary Medicine Rehabilitation Robotic -Assisted Surgery Sleep Disorders Center Stroke Care Surgery Urgent Care Wellness Services Women's Services Wound Healing and Hyperbaric Medicine Introduction On behalf of the Adventist Health -Portland (AHP), the hospital's Community Outreach Committee under the guidance of the Community Benefit Compliance Committee and the hospital's Administration and Board , conducted a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) to distinguish the unmet m edical and public health needs within the greater East Multnomah County area. The study has two objectives. One objective was to meet the state and federal requirement that the hospital conduct a comprehensive community health needs assessment every three years. The second, ultimately more important objective was to conduct a study that would provide a guide for AHP to build a consensus on the area's health care needs and provide a basis for the implementation plan to best direct our resources to improve th e health of the area's residents. The information for this report was collected from multiple primary and secondary sources. First, our membership with the Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborate gave us access to the group's in -debt analysis of the com munity health needs of Multnomah County. Secondly, a Community Health Expert survey was sent to public health experts within the hospi tal and through the community. The data also includes a review of publicly collected health and demographic statistics. Adventist Medical Center, like other non -profit hospitals, is a tax-exempt institution and has a statutory obligation to provide community services. The State of Oregon and the Federal government require non -profit hospitals to report the value of the commu nity services provided during the year. The government identities that collect this data have the responsibility to assure the public that all healthcare organizations claiming non -profit, tax - exempt status fulfill their fiduciary obligation by providing c ommunity benefit commensurate in value to the organization's tax savings. The guidelines used to determine what activities qualify as measurable community benefit, for both the state of Oregon and the Internal Revenue Department, are based on the guidelin es created by the Catholic Hospital Association. Members of the AMC Community Benefit Compliance Commit tee served on various committees with the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Healthcare Services to develop the State's community benefit collection and reporting process. With the passage of the Accountable Care Act, non -profit hospitals will be receiving additional scrutiny. In creating this document, one of the greatest challenges was updating the secondary data from our previous CHNA. Data sources used at that time often were either not updated with current data or there were methodology changes for the more current data. An example would be data that was previously reported as an annual figure are now reported as a three -year average. Some data was extracted from a one -time report . 6 Executive Summary One of the goals of any CHNA is improving the preparation process, data gathering and addressing gaps in our previous CHNA. We believe we have addressed the short falls with this document. We have also continued our membership with the Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborate and we continue to use the CHNA generated by that or ganization as a major supplement to our own CHNA. The following bullet points are the major findings of this report. Since our 201 3 CHNA , it has been observed that the concentration of our patients, either receiving charity care and Medicaid, has increase by a substantial amount in a number of zip codes in our service area. Black/African Americans experienced the greatest number of disparities with the highest level of concern relative to other communities of color.

Allergies are the 6th leading cause of chronic illness in the U nited States . Up to one -third of cancer cases in the United States are related to excess weight or obesity, physical inactivity, and/or poor nutrition. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in both men and women in the United States. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. While mental disorders are common in the United States, their burden of illness is particularly concentrated among those who experience disability due to serious mental illness (SMI). Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and is the fifth leading cause among people aged 65 years and over. 7 In 2013, suicide was the second leading cause of death among persons aged 15 -24 years, the secon d among persons aged 25 -34 years, the fourth among person aged 35 - 54 years, the eighth among persons aged 55 -64 years, the seventeenth among persons 65 years and older, and the tenth leading cause of death across all ages. People with mental health disorde rs are more likely than people without mental health disorders to experience an alcohol or substance use disorder.

About 110,000 more Oregonians were poor in 2014 than in 2009 at the end of the Great Recession. Multnomah County child poverty prevalence is higher for all communities of color than nationally. Between 2014 and 2015, home lessness among individuals increased in 19 states. The largest increases were in New York (3,492 more people), California (2,391), Oregon (1,473), Washington (1,136), and Illinois (802). A review of the results of the two surveys shows similar concerns a mong the both. Those concerns are as follows: Behavior/Mental Health Access to Affordable Health Care Life Style Concerns surrounding: Drug and Alcohol Abuse Health Eating Habits Obesity Lack of Exercise Social Determinates of Health Housing Homelessness 8 Whom We Serve In conducting a community health needs assessment, a hospital has many decisions to make. One of the decisions a hospital needs to make is to determine what is the community that they serve as it applies to their needs assessment. The Tre asury Department and the IRS allow a hospital facility to take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances in defining the community it serves. A hospital needs to make sure that it does nothing to exclude any at risk populations. Adventist M edical Center (AMC) is a member of the Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborate (HCWC) (see appendix C). The Needs Assessment that was developed by the HCWC is substantial and meets the Federal requirements required. The decision was made by the AMC Communi ty Benefit Committee to supplement the work completed with the Collaborate with a Community Health Needs Assessment of a more narrowly defined area. We established our service area using our hospital's patients declared place of residence. Our service area would direct where we would allocate our hospital resources to be used to address the community needs identified by this needs assessment. In keeping with the spirit of recent IRS proposed regulations, AMC has determined from its hospital patient bas e, the zip codes where our patients live. \"Finally, if a hospital facility uses a method of defining its community that takes into account patient populations, these proposed regulations require the hospital facility to treat as patients all individuals who receive care from the hospital facility, without regard to whether (or how much) they or their insurers pay for the care received or whether they are eligible for financial assistance.\" 78 FR 20523 April 2, 2013 This data set was draw from 46,819 unduplicated patients from January 2015 to June 2016. In the following table, the top 22 zip codes are listed. This represents 77.96% of the 46,819 patients. The first column list the zip codes in order of total amount of patients from most to least. For each zip code, the number of Charity Care and Medicaid patients for that zip code is listed along with the total of both. For each category, a percent of the zip codes total patient counted is listed. For example, for zip code 97236, 6.65% of the 3,803 patients from that zip code had received Charity Care and 42.83% had Medicaid. Please note that the 46,819 patients are patients that were either inpatients or outpatients that use AMC hospita l facilities for health care services. AMC patients that were patients exclusively of AMC Home Health Services, AMC Hospice or Adventist Health Medical Group are not counted as part of this group. The second table represents the top ten zip codes for AMC patients using either Charity Care or Medicaid and a column for combined total of Charity Care and Medicaid patients. For zip code 97236, 51.39% of the AMC patient count for 97233 were either Charity Care or Medicaid patients. It also had the lowest median income for those ten zip codes. 9 Total Unique (unduplicated) patients that provided Zip Code. The Zip Codes chosen above had a minimum of 500 patients Total patient count for those patients providing Zip Codes is 46,819. Unique patients are the unduplicated count of patients (each individual patient only counted once). Above chart includes hospital patients only.

The following is from the Federal Register / Vol. 79, No. 250 / Wednesday, December 31, 2014 /Rules and regulations (b) Conducting a CHNA \u2014(1) In general. To conduct a CHNA for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, a hospital facility must complete all of the following steps: (i) Define the community it serves. (ii) Assess the health needs of that community. (iii) In as sessing the health needs of the community, solicit and take into account input received from persons who represent the broad interests of that community, including those with special knowledge of or expertise in public health. (4) Assessing community health needs. To assess the health needs of the community it serves for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, a hospital facility must identify significant health needs of the community, prioritize those health needs, and identify resources (such as organizations, facilities, and programs in the community, including those of the hospital facility) potentially available to address those health needs. For these purposes, the health needs of a community include requisites for the improvement or maintenance of health status both in the community at large and in particular parts of the community (such as particular neighborhoods or populations experiencing health disparities). These needs may include, for example, the need to add ress financial and other barriers to accessing care, to prevent illness, to ensure adequate nutrition, or to address social, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence health in the community. A hospital facility may determine whether a health need is significant based on all of the facts and circumstances present in the community it serves. In addition, a hospital facility may use any criteria to prioritize the significant health needs it identifies, including, but not limited to, the burden, sco pe, severity, or urgency of the health need; the estimated feasibility and effectiveness of possible interventions; the health disparities associated with the need; or the importance the community places on addressing the need. (5) Persons representing th e broad interests of the community \u2014(i) In general. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, a hospital facility must solicit and take into account input received from all of the following sources in identifying and prioritizing significant health needs and in identifying resources potentially available to address those health needs: (A) At least one state, local, tribal, or regional governmental public health department (or equivalent department or agency), or a State Office of Rural Health described in section 338J of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254r), with knowledge, information, or expertise relevant to the health needs of that community. 16 (B) Members of medically underserved, low -income, and minority populations in the communi ty served by the hospital facility, or individuals or organizations serving or representing the interests of such populations. For purposes of this paragraph (b), medically underserved populations include populations experiencing health disparities or at r isk of not receiving adequate medical care as a result of being uninsured or underinsured or due to geographic, language, financial, or other barriers. (ii) Additional sources of input. In addition to the sources described in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, a hospital facility may solicit and take into account input received from a broad range of persons located in or serving its community, including, but not limited to, health care consumers and consumer advocates, nonprofit and community -based organ izations, academic experts, local government officials, local school districts, health care providers and community health centers, health insurance and managed care organizations, private businesses, and labor and workforce representatives. Two Survey App roach In order to be compliant with above IRS regulations, AMC has chosen two different community surveys to be able to take into account the various groups that need to be represented. In order to not duplicate responses, AMC has chosen to use the Health y Columbia Willamette (HCWC) has their main source of primary data for our service area. Use the following link to view the full HCWC CHNA: https://multco.us/healthy -colu mbia -willamette -collaborative/reports A second survey (Service provider) was conducted to gather the opinions of the community from various health experts in our community.

Where data by county was not really available, statewide data was used. 20 Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities According to the Multnomah County Health Department Report \"2014 Report Card on Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities\" December 2014 (The full report can be found at http://web.multco.us/health/reports ), \"In Multnomah County, all racial and ethnic groups examined in this report experienced some disparities relative to their non - Latino White counterparts. A striking number of disparities exist for Black/African Americans and American Indian/Alaska Natives. Numerous disparities also exist for Latinos and Asian/Pacific Islanders, but those communities also fared better than non -Latino Whites for some indicator s. Non -Latino Black/African American Black/African Americans experienced the greatest number of disparities with the highest level of concern relative to other communities of color. As shown in Figure 1, of the 33 indicators examined in this report, Black /African Americans experienced disparities for nine indicators that require inter - vention and 18 indicators that need improvement . There were only four indicators where a disparity was not detected. There were no indicators where the group fared significan tly better than the non - Latino White comparison group. Black/African Americans experienced a geographic disparity for each of the physical environment indicators.\" Black/African Americans experienced the largest number of health disparities among racial/ ethnic groups in Multnomah County. The report shows statistically significant disparities for 9 of the 18 health indicators for African Americans. Health indicators requiring improvement/intervention include: Cigarette use Obesity Teen birth rates Health Insurance Children with untreated tooth decay First trimester prenatal care Low birth weight babies Infant mortality Stroke mortality Prostate cancer mortality Gonorrhea HIV incidence Diabetes mortality Coronary Heart Disease All cancer 21 Relative to their White non -Hispanic counterparts African Americans: continued to have significantly higher proportions of mothers who did not receive prenatal care . in their first trimester experienced an infant mortality rate that was almost twice as hi gh. had a higher stroke mortality rate. had a diabetes mortality rate more than two and a half times as high. were almost two times as likely to die of prostate cancer though there was no disparity in other forms of cancer. Homi cide rates about six times higher. Social and Economic indicators with improvement needed include: Children living in poverty Children living in single -parent households Children not meeting third -grade reading standards Unemployment 22 Asian/Pacific Islanders Asian/Pacific Islanders experienced fewer health disparities than other racial/ethnic groups in Multnomah County. For 11 indica tors, Asian/Pacific Islanders, did significantly bet ter than non - Latino Whites. Though this group, as a whole, fared well for ma ny indicators, it is likely that aggregation of data into this large group is masking some disparities being experienced by sub -groups of Asian/Pacific Islanders. More attention should be given to disaggregated data for this population. A supplemental repo rt focusing on Pacific Islander health disparities is forthcoming. Health indicators with improvement needed include: First trimester prenatal care Low birth weight babies Homicide rates Adults without health insurance was the one indicator that requires intervention level for Asian/Pacific Island ers. The percentage without health insurance is more than two times higher among non -Latino Asian/Pacific Islanders in Multnomah County than among non -Latino Whites. Relative to their White non -Hispani c counterparts Asian/Pacific Islanders: continued to have significantly higher proportions of mothers who did not receive prenatal care in their first trimester. continued to have higher proportions of low birth weight births. experienced a higher homicide rate. Social and Economic indicators with improvement needed include: Third -grade reading level Post -high school education Native Americans There are statistically significant disparities in 5 of the 18 health indicators for Native Americans and 12 at the needs improvement level . However, for seven of the other health indicators, Native Americans did not have a sufficient number of events to calculate a rate. Health indicators requiring intervention: Teen births Current cigarette smoking Adults with no physical activity outside of work Health indicators needing improvement include: No first trimester prenatal care Stroke mortality 23 Infant mortality Low birthweight Self-reported mental health Relative to their White non -Hispanic counte rparts: Native American had higher rates of teen births. Native Americans continued to have significantly higher proportions of mothers who did not receive prenatal care in their first trimester. Social and Economic indicators with improvement needed incl ude: Are more than twice as likely to have children living in poverty Twice as likely to have children not meeting third -grade reading standards Lack of post -high school education Hispanics There are statistically significant disparities in 6 of the 18 health indicators for Hispanics. There were also eight indicators where Latinos fared significantly better than non -Latino Whites. Health indicators requiring intervention include: Obesity First trimester prenatal care Untreated tooth decay Teen birth rate Lack of health insurance Health indicators needing improvement include: HIV incidence Diabetes mortality rates Overall health status Relative to their White non -Hispanic counterparts Hispanics: continued to have significantly higher proportions of mothers who did not receive prenatal care in their first trimester experienced a teen birth rate that was 3.5 times higher . Latino adults were two times more likely to lack health insurance Social and Economic indicators with improvement needed include: Are more than twice as likely to have children living in poverty 24 Twice as likely to have children not meeting third -grade reading standards Lack of post -high school education Homicide ra te From the \"Facing Race - 2013 Legislative Report Card on Racial Equity. Whites are far less likely to face poverty than communities of color in Oregon. In 2012, the poverty rate for Whites was only 15 percent, but 30 percent for Latinos, 34 percent for Native Americans and Alaska Natives, 36 percent for Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders and 41 percent for African Americans. As for public education, in Multnomah County, just 7 percent of White students do not graduate from high school compared to 3 0 percent of students of color. In Oregon's placement of children in foster care, Native American youth are more than five times as likely to be placed into foster care; African American youth are four times as likely, and Pacific Islanders are twice as l ikely to white youth. Oregon's population is increasingly diverse \u2014more multiracial, multicultural and multilingual. From 1990 to 2012, Oregonians of color have increased from just 9.2 percent of the state's population to 22.4 percent. Communities of colo r face greater obstacles to health insurance than White Oregonians generally do. The primary source of health coverage in Oregon \u2014 job-based insurance \u2014 is not accessed by people of color to the same degree given the higher unemployment and underemployment ra tes. While two out of three uninsured Oregonians in 2012 were White, Oregonians of color were significantly over -represented among the uninsured. http://www.safetyandjustice.org/files/Facing%20Race%202013.pdf 25 Leading Causes of Death From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention site website: Chronic Diseases: The Leading Causes of Death and Disability in the United States Chronic diseases and conditions \u2014such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and arthr itis\u2014are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems. As of 2012, about half of all adults \u2014117 million people \u2014had one or more chronic health conditions. One of four adults had two or more chronic health conditions. Seven of the to p 10 causes of death in 2010 were chronic diseases. Two of these chronic diseases \u2014heart disease and cancer \u2014together accounted for nearly 48% of all deaths. Obesity is a serious health concern. During 2009 -2010, more than one -third of adults, or about 78 million people, were obese (defined as body mass index [BMI] 30 kg/m2). Nearly one of five youths aged 2 -19 years was obese (BMI 95th percentile). Arthritis is the most common cause of disability. Of the 53 million adults with a doctor diagnosis of arthr itis, more than 22 million say they have trouble with their usual activities because of arthritis. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, lower -limb amputations other than those caused by injury, and new cases of blindness among adults. http://ww w.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/index.htm United States ' leading causes of death 2014 National Vital Statistics Reports, Diseases of heart (heart disease) Malignant neoplasms (cancer) Chronic lower respiratory diseases Accidents (unintentional injuries) Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) Alzheimer's disease Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) Influenza and pneumonia Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis (kidney disease) Intentional self -harm (suicide) Bold print are causes of death whose position on the list has change since 2010 United States ' leading causes of death 2010 - National Vital Statistics Reports, Vol. 61, No. 4 Diseases of heart (heart disease) 26 Malignant neoplasms (cancer) Chronic lower respiratory diseases Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) Accidents (unintentional injuries) Alzheimer's disease Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis (kidney disease) Influenza and pneumonia Intentional self-harm (suicide) Data source: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf Oregon's Leading Causes of Death 2014 Malignant neoplasms (cancer) Diseases of heart (heart disease) Chronic lower respiratory diseases Cerebrovascular diseases (s troke) Accidents (unintentional injuries) Alzheimer's disease Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) Intentional self -harm (suicide) Alcohol -induced Deaths Oregon 's Leading Causes of Death 2011 Malignant neoplasms (cancer) Diseases of heart (heart disease) Chronic lower respiratory diseases Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) Accidents (unintentional injuries) Alzheimer's disease Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) Alcohol -induced Deaths Suicide Data source: http://public.health.oregon.gov/BirthDeathCertificates/VitalStatistics/annualreports/11v2/Pages/chapter6.aspx Oregon's Leading Causes of Death 1990 -2007 Malignant neoplasms (cancer) Diseases of heart (heart disease) Chronic lower respiratory diseases Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) Accidents (unintentional injuries) Alzheimer's disease Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) 27 Alcohol -induced Deaths Influenza and pneumonia Source of data: http://www.dhs.state.or.us/dhs/ph/chs/data/arpt/07v2/chp6toc.shtml Mult nomah County 's leading causes of death 2014 Malignant neoplasms (cancer) Diseases of heart (heart disease) Chronic lower respiratory diseases Accidents (unintentional injuries) Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) Alzheimer's disease Diabetes mellitus ( diabetes Multnomah County 's leading causes of death 2011 Malignant neoplasms (cancer) Diseases of heart (heart disease) Chronic lower respiratory diseases Accidents (unintentional injuries) Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) Alzheimer's disease Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) Data source: http://public.health.oregon.gov/BirthDeathCertificates/VitalStatistics/annualreports/11v2/Documents/Chapter%206/Table635.pdf Multnomah County 's leading causes of death 2007 Malignant neoplasms (cancer) Diseases of heart (heart disease) Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) Accidents (unintentional injuries) Chronic lower respiratory diseases Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) Alzheimer's disease Data source: http://www.dhs.state.or.us/dhs/ph/chs/data/arpt/07v2/chapter 6/table635.pdf 28 Clackamas County 's leading causes of death 2014 Malignant neoplasms (cancer) Diseases of heart (heart disease) Chronic lower respiratory diseases Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) Accidents (unintentional injuries) Alzheimer's disease Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) Clackamas County 's leading causes of death 2011 Malignant neoplasms (cancer) Diseases of heart (heart disease) Chronic lower respiratory diseases Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) Accidents (unintenti onal injuries) Alzheimer's disease Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) Data source: http://public.health.oregon.gov/BirthDeathCertificates/VitalStatistics/annualreports/11v2/Documents/Chapter%206/Table635.pdf Clackamas County 's leading causes of death 2007 Malignant neoplasms (cancer) Diseases of heart (heart disease) Cerebrovascular diseases (stroke) Accidents (unintentional injuries) Chronic lower respiratory diseases Alzheimer's disease Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) Data source: http://www.dhs.state. or.us/dhs/ph/chs/data/arpt/07v2/chapter6/table635.pdf Leading Causes of Death Summary Nationally -Accidents moved up to 4th, Influenza and pneumonia moved up one, Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis (kidney disease) and stroke moved down one.

Health Behaviors include measures of smoking, diet and exercise, alcohol use and risky sex behavior. Clinical care includes measures of access to care and quality of care. Social and economic factors include measures of education, employment, income, family and social support, and community safety. The physical environment includes measures of environmental quality and the built environment. The health outcomes ranking is based on measures of mortality and morbidity. The mortality rank represents length of life and is based on a measure of premature death; the years of potential lif e lost prior to age 75. The morbidity rank is based on measures that represent health -related quality of life and birth outcomes. Four morbidity measures were combined: self -reported fair or poor health, poor physical health days, poor mental health days, and the percent of births with low birth weight. 31 Date Updated: September 25, 2015 32 Prevalence of Selected Chronic Conditions among Adults by County County Arthritis Asthma Heart Attack Coronary Heart form BRFSS, by County, Oregon, 2010 -2013, Chronic Diseases among Oregon Adults Prevalence of Selected Chronic Conditions among Adults by County County Stroke Diabetes High Blood Pressure High Blood form BRFSS, by County, Oregon, 2010 -2013, Chronic Diseases among Oregon Adults Rates for both of the above tables are age -adjusted. Age-adjusting a rate is a way to make fairer comparisons between groups with different age distributions. For example, a county h aving a higher percentage of elderly people may have a higher rate of death or hospitalization than a county with a younger population, merely because the elderly are more likely to die or be hospitalized. The same distortion can happen when we compare rac es, genders, or time periods. Age adjustment can make the different groups more comparable. 33 Date Updated: September 25, 2015 34 Preventive Clinical Services Performed Age-adjusted Prevalence of Preventive Health Screening among Adults by County County Current1 on colorectal cancer screening (5075 years old; %) Pap test within past three years (women 2165 years old with a cervix; %) Mammogram within past two years (women 5074 years old; %) Cholesterol checked within past fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in the past year; a colonoscopy wit hin the past 10 years; or, a sigmoidoscopy within the past five years as well as an FOBT within the past three years.

Neither adult nor child targets are likely to be met in the foreseeable future. This is in part due to low rates among adolescents and non -senior adults, and persistent gender differences among adults. About the Data: Data source is the ALERT Immunization Information System.

Accessed 7 -24-2016. 38 Falls Among Older Adults in Oregon Fatal falls The rate of fatal falls among adults age 65 years and older was 91.9 per 100,000 in 2013, an increase of 46% since 2000. Older men have a higher risk of fatal fall, compared to women within the same age group. The rate of fatal falls among people age 85 ye ars and older is 21 times greater than for those age 65-74 years. An aging population, combined with increased life expectancy means fatal falls will likely continue to increase in the future. Fall hospitalizations In 2013, the rate of fall hosp italization in Oregon was 964.4 per 100,000 adults age 65 and older. Women were hospitalized more often than men. There were 1,230.5 hospitalizations per 100,000 women age 65 and older in 2013, compared to 643.8 per 100,000 men age 65 and older. Hospitaliz ation increases with age; those age 85 years and older are 7 times more likely to be hospitalized than those age 65 -74 years. http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/InjuryFatalityData/Documents/Fact%20Sheets/Falls_Older_A dults _2015 v02262015.pdf 39 Pregnancy -Childbirth How does CDC define pregnancy -related deaths? For reporting purposes, a pregnancy -related death is defined as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 1 year of pregnancy termination \u2014regardless of the duration or site of the pregnancy \u2014from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes. In the United States Of the 3,404 deaths within a year of pregnancy termination that occurred during 2011 -2012 and were reported to CDC, 1,329 were found to be pregnancy -related. The pregnancy -related mortality ratios were 17.8 and 15.9 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Considerable racial disparities in pregnancy -related mortality exi st. During 2011 -2012, the pregnancy - related mortality ratios were \u2014 11.8 deaths per 100,000 live births for white women. 41.1 deaths per 100,000 live births for black women. 15.7 deaths per 100,000 live births for women of other races. 40 The reasons for th e overall increase in pregnancy -related mortality are unclear. The use of computerized data linkages by the states, changes in the way causes of death are coded, and the addition of a pregnancy checkbox to the death certificate in many states have likely improved identification of pregnancy -related deaths over time. Whether the actual risk of a woman dying from pregnancy -related causes has increased is unclear. Many studies show that an increasing number of pregnant women in the United States have chronic h ealth conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and chronic heart disease. These conditions may put a pregnant woman at higher risk of pregnancy complications. Although the overall risk of dying from pregnancy complications is low, some women are at a hig her risk than others. The higher pregnancy -related mortality ratios during 2009 -2011 are due to an increase in infection and sepsis deaths. Many of these deaths occurred during the 2009 -2010 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 pandemic which occurred in the United Sta tes between April 2009 and June 2010. Influenza deaths accounted for 12 percent of all pregnancy -related deaths during that 15-month period. Variability in the risk of death by race, ethnicity, and age indicates that more can be done to understand and red uce pregnancy -related deaths. 41 Perinatal Quality Vitamin D Studies Vitamin D inadequacy (<50 nmol /L) is estimated to affect about 38% of U.S. reproductive -aged women and 28% of U.S. pregnant women. Among pregnant women, vitamin D deficiency varies significantly by racial and ethnic groups, ranging from 13% of non -Hispanic white women to 80% of non -Hispanic black women. Women who have low levels of vitamin D may be at higher risk for problems during pregnancy, including preterm birth, but more research is needed to clarify the relationship between pregnancy problems and vitamin D. CDC conducted a study in Michigan, North Carolina, and Washington State to examine vitamin D levels in stored blood samples of women who had a preterm birth. An additional analysis confirmed seasonal changes in levels of 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (a substance used to measure vitamin D status), with peak levels in summer and the lowest levels in winter. However, there are smaller seasonal changes among black mothers. CDC also funded researchers at the University of Pittsburgh to conduct a study examining whether vitamin D deficiency an d variations in vitamin D receptor genes are associated with risk of preterm birth in pregnant women . Smoking in Pregnancy Despite decreases in smoking prevalence over recent years, about 19% of women of reproductive age are smokers (2009 data), and about 10% of women reported smoking during pregnancy in 2011 (25 states). In addition to a variety of negative pregnancy outcomes , smoking during pregnancy is associated with 5% -8% of the cases of preterm birth. CDC is actively working to improve reproductive health outcomes through the reduction of smoking among women before, during, and after pregnancy in the United States and glo bally. Teen Pregnancy Trends in Teen Pregnancy by Age The declines in teenage pregnancy have been much steeper for younger than for older teenagers. The rate for teenagers 15 -17 years of age dropped more than half, from 77.1 per 1,000 in 1990 to 36.4 in 2009. The rate for older teenagers 18 -19 years of age fell as well, by 38 percent from its 1991 peak (172.1 per 1,000) to 106.3 in 2009. 42 The rates in 2009 for these age groups were also lower than for any year during the 1976 - 2009 period.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that in 2012, 9.9% of the population of Oregon were diagnosed with diabetes (7.2% in 2010, 6.8% in 2007). It is estimated that 27.8% of these have undiagnosed diabetes. It was the 7th leading cause of death in 2014. Diabetes is becoming more common in the United States. From 1980 through 2014, the number o f Americans with diagnosed diabetes has increased fourfold (from 5.5 million to 22.0 million).

Assuming low incidence and relatively high diabetes mortality, total diabetes prevalence (diagnosed and undiagnosed cases) is projected to increase from 14% in 2010 to 21% of the US adult population by 2050. However, if recent increases in diabetes incidence continue and diabetes mortality is relatively low, prevalence will increase to 33% by 2050. A middle -ground scenario projects a prevalence of 25% to 28% by 2050. Intervention can reduce, but not eliminate, increases in diabet es prevalence. These projected increases are largely attributable to the aging of the US population, increasing numbers of members of higher -risk minority groups in the population, and people with diabetes living longer. Effective strategies will need to be undertaken to moderate the impact of these factors on national diabetes burden. Our analysis suggests that widespread implementation of reasonably effective preventive interventions focused on high -risk subgroups of the population can considerably reduc e, but not eliminate, future increases in diabetes prevalence. \" http://www.pophealthmetrics.com/content/8/1/29 In 2014, diabetes was the 7th leading cause of death in both Multnomah and Clackamas Counties.

Nearly 40 percent of middle -age adults, ages 40 to 59, were obese (39.5 percent), which was more than younger adults, ages 20 to 39 (30 .3 percent) or older adults, ages 60 and over (35.4 percent). More than 6 percent of adults were severely obese (body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher). More women than men, ages 20 and over, have higher rates of obesity and extreme obesity (36.1 percent a nd 8.3 percent versus 33.5 percent and 4.4 percent). Obesity rates were highest among Black (47.8 percent) adults, followed by Latino (42.5 percent) and White (32.6 percent) adults and lowest among Asian American (10.8 perfect) adults. Children: Approximat ely 17 percent of children and teenagers (ages 2 to 19) were obese from 2011 to 2012, and 31.8 percent were either overweight or obese. More than one -in-12 children (8.4 percent) are obese in early childhood (2 - to 5-year -olds). By ages 12 to 19, 20.5 percent of children and adolescents were obese. More than 2 percent of young children were severely obese, 5 percent of 6 -to 11 -year -olds were severely obese and 6.5 percent of 12 - to 19 -year -olds were severely obese. Racial and ethnic inequities persist a mong children also; 22.5 percent of Latino children and 20.2 percent of Black children are obese, compared to 14.1 percent of non -Latino White and 6.8 percent of Asian -American children. RACIAL AND ETHNIC INEQUITIES AND OBESITY Among adults: Obesity rates are higher among Black (47.8 percent) and Latino (43 percent) adults than Whites (32.6 percent) and Asian Americans (10.8 percent). Rates of obesity (56.6 percent) and severe obesity are highest among Black women. Nearly 78 percent of Latino and 76.2 percent of Black adults are either overweight or obese, compared to 67.2 percent of Whites and 38.6 percent of Asian Americans. Black women are more than twice as likely to be severely obese and Latinas are nearly 1.5 times more likely to be severely obes e than White women. A reported 54 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native adults, ages 20 to 74, are obese and 81 percent are overweight or obese, according to an Indian Health Survey data. 59 Among children: Overweight and obesity rates are higher, start at earlier ages and increase faster among Black and Latino children than among White children. More than 20 percent of Black, 22.4 percent of Latino, 14.1 percent of White and 8.6 percent of Asian American children and teenagers ages 2 to 19 are obes e.

The prevalence of obesity was 36.5% (crude estimate) among U.S. adults during 2011 -2014. Overall, the prevalence of obesity among middle -aged adults aged 40 -59 (40.2%) and older adults aged 60 and over (37.0%) was higher than among younger adults aged 20 -39 (32.3%). No significant difference in prevalence was observed between middle -aged and older adults (Figure 1). Overall, the prevalence of obesity among women (38.3%) was higher than among men (34.3%). For adults aged 20 -39 and 40 -59, the prevalence of obesity was higher among women than among men, but the difference between older women and men aged 60 and over was not significant. Among both men and women, the prevalence of obesity followed a similar pattern by age. Men aged 40 -59 (38.3%) had a higher prevalence of obesity than men aged 20 -39 (30.3%). Women aged 40 -59 (42.1% ) had a higher prevalence of obesity than women aged 20 -39 (34.4%). The prevalence of obesity among men and women aged 20 -39 was lower than among men and women aged 60 and over, except the difference for men was not significant.

Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics. 2015 The prevalence of obesity among adults by race and Hispanic origin The prevale nce of obesity was lowest among non -Hispanic Asian adults (11.7%), followed by non-Hispanic white (34.5%), Hispanic (42.5%), and non -Hispanic black (48.1%) adults. All differences were significant. The pattern among women was similar to the pattern in the overall 62 adult population. The prevalence of obesity was 11.9% in non -Hispanic Asian, 35.5% in non - Hispanic white, 45.7% in Hispanic, and 56.9% in non -Hispanic black women. The prevalence of obesity was lower in non -Hispanic Asian (11.2%) men compared with non-Hispanic white (33.6%), non -Hispanic black (37.5%), and Hispanic (39.0%) men. No difference in obesity prevalence was observed between non -Hispanic black and non -Hispanic white men, nor was there a difference between non -Hispanic black and Hispanic me n (Figure 2). The only differences by sex were found among non -Hispanic black and Hispanic adults. The prevalence of obesity among non -Hispanic black women was 56.9% compared with 37.5% in non-Hispanic black men. The prevalence of obesity was 45.7% among Hispanic women compared with 39.0% in Hispanic men. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db219.pdf 63 Oregon According to the Oregon Public Health report \"2015 State Health Improvement Plan\", Obesity is the number two cause of preventable death in Oregon and nationally, second only to tobacco use. Obesity related conditions account for 1,400 deaths in Oregon each year. Preventing obesity among Oregonians lowers the risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, high blood pressure, high chole sterol, arthritis, stress and depression. Each year, Oregon spends about $1.6 billion ($339 million paid by Medicaid) in medical expenses for obesity -related chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Annual medical costs of persons who are o bese are estimated to be $1,429 higher than those who are not obese. Obesity prevalence among Oregon adults has risen dramatically in the past two decades, from 11.2% in 1990 to 26.8% in 2013. (27.9% in 2014) . The obesity rate for the state of Oregon wa s 25.9%. Multnomah County was 21.4% Clackamas count was 25.2%. Obesity is less prevalent among younger (18 -24) and older (75+) age groups. Obesity is most prevalent between the ages of 35 to 74. 64 Obesity among adults by sex, race and ethnicity, Oregon 2010 -2011 Information from State Health Improvement Plan 65 Between 1999 -2002 and 2011 -2014, the prevalence of obesity was stable among children aged 6 -11; increased among adolescents aged 12 -19; and increased from 1999 -2002 to 2003 -2006 among those aged 2 -5, then declined through 2011 -2014. Excess body weight in children is associated with excess morbidity during childhood and excess body weight in adulthood (13 -16). Obesity among children is defined as a body mass index at or above t he sex-and age -specific 95th percentile of the CDC growth charts (15,16). From 1988 -1994 to 1999 -2002, obesity increased among children aged 2 -19. Among children aged 2 -5, the prevalence of obesity increased from 1999 -2002 to 2003 - 2006 and then declined t hrough 2011 -2014. Among children aged 6-11, the prevalence of obesity was stable from 1999 -2002 to 2011 - 2014. Between 1999 -2002 and 2011 -2014, the prevalence of obesity among adolescents aged 12 -19 increased 28%. SOURCE: CDC/NCHS, Health, United States, 2015, Table 59. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). 66 In 2011 -2014, among children and adolescents aged 2 -19, Hispanic children and adolescents had the highest prevalence of obesity (21.9%) and non-Hispanic Asian children and adolescents had the lowest prevalence (8.6%) http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus15.pdf 67 Heart Disease and Stroke According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics report \"Summary Health Statistics: National Health Interview Survey, 2014\" The age-adjusted percentages (with standard errors) of selected circulatory diseases among adults aged 18 and over, by selected characterist ics: United States, 2014 Summary Health Statistics: National Health Interview Survey, 2014 All Types of Heart Disease Coronary Heart Disease Hypertension Stroke Total 10.9 (0.21) 5.5 (0.16) 24.5 (0.27) 2.4 (0.010) Sex: Male 12.2 (0.31) 7.3 (0.26) 25.3 (0.41) 2.5 (0.15) Female 9.8 (0.27) 4.0 (0.17) 23.7 (0.35) 2.4 (0.13) Race: White 11.1 (0.24) 5.6 (0.18) 23.5 (0.30) 2.3 (0.11) Black or African American 10.3 (0.53) 5.5 (0.41) 33.1 (0.73) 4.0 (0.34) American Indian or Alaska Native 13.7 (2.80) 6.0 (1.44) 26.4 (3.02) 3.0 (0.84) Asian 6.0 (0.65) 3.3 (0.47) 19.5 (0.96) 1.5 (0.34) Hispanic or Latino 7.8 (0.47) 4.9 (0.40) 23.0 (0.64) 2.4 (0.27) Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 19.1 (5.51) 6.9 (2.06) 36.4 (6.50) *8.6 (3.84) * Estimates are considered unreliable.

In 2001, for the first time, more deaths (five) resulted from cancer than from heart disease. During 201 4, heart disease was the second leading cause of death; 6,523 Oregonians succumbed to it, 1,339 fewer than from malignant neopla sms. The crude death rate decreased from 165.8 in 2013 to 164.6 in 2014, while the age -adjusted death rate decreased from 134.6 per 100,000 population to 131.3. By comparison, the age -adjusted death rate was 264.2 in 1990, 101.2% higher than the 2014 rate. Heart disease was listed on 6,266 death certificates as a contributing factor in decedents' death, but not the underlying cause. The 2014 crude death rate for heart disease was 20.3% higher for males than females (180.0 versus 149.6). The 2014 age -adjust ed death rate for heart disease was 69.3% higher for males than females (170.5 versus 100.7). Heart disease was the leading cause of death for Oregonians age 85 or older and one of the top -five causes among all Oregonians, except decedents less than one y ear of age. It was the second leading cause of death for residents aged 55 - 84. The median age at death was 83 years in 2014. The relatively older ages at which Oregonians died from heart disease suppress its rank among the causes of premature death; there were 24,665 years of potential life lost, making it the third leading cause of premature death following cancer and unintentional injuries. Excluding counties with fewer than 20 deaths due to heart disease, the age -adjusted death rates for eight Oregon c ounties during 2012 -2014 were significantly higher than the state rate (132.1): were recorded for four counties: Benton (106.5), Washington (112.6), Lane (123.8) and Clackamas (125.1). 69 Cerebrovascular disease (Stroke) Accounting for 5.3% of all deaths, cerebrovascular disease was the fourth leading cause of mortality among Oregonians. The number of d eaths attributed to cerebrovascular disease increased from 1,769 in 2013 to 1,821 in 2014. The number of deaths in which this disease was a contributing factor remained the same in 2014 as in 2013 at 1,557 deaths. For the past decade, the crude death rate for this cause has trended downward; however, between 2013 and 2014, the crude death rate increased from 45.1 per 100,000 population to 46.0 per 100,000 population. The age - adjusted death rate remained at 37.0 in 2014. \"More females than males died from cerebrovascular disease, and the male crude death rate was 16.4% lower than the female rate (41.8 versus 50.0). However, the age -adjusted rate for males was 16.8% higher than the rate for females (40.3 versus 34.5)\". \"Fatal cerebrovascular disease was uncommon before age 45, but it was the fifth most common cause of death among Oregon residents aged 65 -74 and fourth most common cause of death among Oregonians aged 75 and older. Nearly three -fourths (73.0%) of the deaths occurred after age 74, and the me dian age at death decreased from 84 in the previous year to 83 years in 2014. During the three -year period 2012 - 2014, two counties had an age - adjusted death rate significantly higher than the state rate (37.2): Linn (45.1) and Josephine (44.3). Two countie s had a significantly lower rate: Yamhill (30.7) and Washington (31.4). The cerebrovascular disease death rate has long been higher in Oregon than in the United States as a whole.

More than half of the deaths due to heart disease in 2009 were in men. About 610,000 Americans die from heart disease each year \u2014that's 1 in every 4 deaths . Coronary heart disease is the most common type of heart disease, killing more than 385,000 people annually. Every year about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack . Of these, 525,000 are a first heart attack and 210,000 happen in people who have already had a heart attack.2 Coronary heart disease alone costs the United States $108.9 billion each year. Th is total includes the cost of health care services, medications, and lost productivity. In the United States, someone has a heart attack every 34 seconds . Each minute, someone in the United States dies from a heart disease -related event. Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most racial/ethnic groups in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics, and whites. For Asian Americans or Pacific Islanders and American Indians or Alaska Natives, heart disease is second only to ca ncer. Risk Factors High blood pressure, high LDL cholesterol, and smoking are key heart disease risk factors for heart disease. About half of Americans (47%) have at least one of these three risk factors. 5 Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including: Diabetes Overweight and obesity Poor diet Physical inactivity Excessive alcohol use Heart disease is the leading cause of death for people of most ethnicities in the United States, including African Americans, Hispanics, and whites. For American Indians or Alaska Natives and Asians or Pacific Islanders, heart disease is second only to cancer. Below are the percentages of all death s caused by heart disease in 2008, listed by ethnicity.4 Race of Ethnic Group % of Deaths African Americans 23.8 American Indians or Alaska Natives 18.4 Asians or Pacific Islanders 22.2 Hispanics 20.8 Whites 23.8 All 23.5 Heart Disease Fact Sheet|Data & Statistics|DHDSP|CDC 74 Stroke Facts Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States, killing nearly 130,000 Americans each year \u2014that's 1 of every 19 deaths . A stroke, sometimes called a brain attack, occurs when a clot blocks the blood supply to the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts. Someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds . Every four minutes , someone dies of stroke. Every year, about 800,000 people in the United States have a stroke. About 610,000 of these are first or new strokes; 185,000 are recurrent strokes. Stroke is an important cause of disability. Stroke reduces mobility in mo re than half of stroke survivors age 65 and over. Stroke costs the nation $34.0 billion annually, including the cost of health care services, medications, and lost productivity. You can't control some stroke risk factors, like heredity, age, gender, and e thnicity. Some medical conditions \u2014including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, overweight or obesity, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) \u2014can also raise your stroke risk. Avoiding smoking and drinking too muc h alcohol, eating a balanced diet, and getting exercise are all choices you can make to reduce your risk. Stroke Facts | cdc.gov Risk Factors High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smokin g are major risk factors for stroke. About half of Americans (49%) have at least one of these three risk factors. Several other medical conditions and unhealthy lifestyle choices can increase your risk for stroke.75 Medical Conditions High blood pressure. High blood pressure, also called hypertension, can greatly increase your risk for stroke. Smoking cigarettes, eating a diet high in salt, and drinking too much alcohol can all raise your blood pressure. High blood cholesterol. High blood cholesterol can bu ild up fatty deposits (plaque) on blood vessel walls. The deposits can block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke. Diet, exercise, and family history affect blood cholesterol levels. Heart disease. Common heart disorders can increase your risk for str oke. For example, coronary artery disease (CAD) increases your risk because a fatty substance called plaque blocks the arteries that bring blood to the heart. Other heart conditions, such as heart valve defects, irregular heartbeat (including atrial fibril lation ), and enlarged heart chambers, can cause blood clots that may break loose and cause a stroke. Diabetes. Having diabetes can increase your risk of stroke and can make the outcome of strokes worse. Diabetes is a condition that causes blood to build up too much sugar instead of delivering it to body tissues. High blood sugar tends to occur with high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Overweight and obesity. Being overweight or obese can raise total cholesterol levels, increase blood pressure, and prom ote the development of diabetes. Previous stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). If you have already had a stroke or a TIA, also known as a \"mini -stroke,\" there is a greater chance that you could have a stroke in the future. Sickle cell disease. This i s a blood disorder that is associated with ischemic stroke, and mainly affects African -American and Hispanic children. A stroke can happen if sickle cells get stuck in a blood vessel and clog blood flow to the brain. About 10% of children with sickle cell disease will have a stroke. Tobacco Use Smoking injures blood vessels and speeds up the hardening of the arteries. The carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke reduces the amount of oxygen that your blood can carry. Secondhand smoke can increase the risk of stro ke for nonsmokers. Alcohol Use Drinking too much alcohol r aises your blood pressure, which increases the risk for stroke. It also increases levels of triglycerides, a form of cholesterol, which can harden your arteries. 76 Physical Inactivity Not getting enou gh exercise can make you gain weight, which can lead to increased blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Inactivity also is a risk factor for diabetes. Stroke Heredity Family history. Having a family history of stroke increases the chance of stroke. Find o ut more about this type of risk at CDC's genomics and disease prevention Web site. Age and gender. The older you are, the more likely you are to have a stroke. For ages 65 and older, men are at greater risk than women to have a stroke. Race and ethnicity. Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indian/Alaska Natives have a greater chance of having a stroke than do non -Hispanic whites or Asians. See CDC's interactive maps to learn more about race and the risk for stroke. http://www.cdc.gov/stroke/risk_factors.htm 77 Health Promotion and Prevention Programs Oregon Health Authority Center for Prevention and Health Promotion 5 Year Strategic Plan 5-Year Heart Disease and Stroke Health Outcome (July 2012 - June 2017) By June 30, 2017, the rate of heart attack hospitalization among Oregon adults ages 74 or younger will be reduced by 12 percent. The 2010 baseline was 135 hospitalizations per 100,000 people under the age of 74 and the 2017 target is 119 hospitalizations per 100,000 people under the age of 74. Leading risk factors for heart disease and stroke include diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, tobacco use and physical inactivity.

Healthy People is a set of goals and objectives with 10-year targets designed to guide national health promotion and disease prevention efforts to improve the health of all people in the United States. 79 80 About Healthy People | Healthy People 2020 81 Blood Cholesterol The following is from the NCHS Data Brief No. 226 December 2015 During 2011 -2014, approximately 12% of adults had high total cholesterol and nearly 19% had low HDL cholesterol. Overall and when examined by sex, non -Hispanic black adults had a lower prevalence of high total cholesterol than non -Hispanic white and Hispanic adults. Non -Hispanic black men had a lower prevalence of low HDL cholesterol than non -Hispanic white and Hispanic men; non -Hispanic black and non -Hispanic Asian women had lower prevalence of low HDL cholesterol than non -Hispanic white a nd Hispanic women. Declining trends between 2007 -2008 and 2013 -2014 were seen in the prevalence of both high total cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol among adults. These results are based on measured cholesterol only and do not take into account whether cholesterol -lowering medications were taken. Total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol are two lipid measures that clinicians may use to assess patient health. In fact, clinicians may use both of these lipid measures, in addition to systolic blood pressure, s moking, and diabetes, to calculate the risk of developing diseases associated with atherosclerosis, such as heart disease and stroke (5). Therefore, both of these lipid measures are important to clinical practices designed to reduce cardiovascular disease in the United States. Total cholesterol is also used to monitor the health of the U.S. population. One of the Healthy People 2020 goals regarding total cholesterol is to reduce the percentage of adults with high total blood cholesterol levels to 13.5% (6 ). For 2011 -2014, approximately 12% of adults aged 20 and over had high total cholesterol, thus meeting this goal. Adults aged 20 -39 and 60 and over also achieved this goal, but adults aged 40 -59 (16.0%) did not. This target was met in all sex and race and Hispanic -origin groups except for non -Hispanic white women (13.8%). Definitions High total cholesterol : Serum total cholesterol greater than or equal to 240 mg/dL. Low HDL cholesterol : Serum HDL cholesterol less than 40 mg/dL. Healthy People 2020; Hear t Disease and Stroke, Object 7 : Reduce the proportion of adults with high total blood cholesterol levels, target: 13.5% 82 Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey During 2011 -2014, 12.1% of adults had high total cholesterol and 18.5% had low high - density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The prevalence of high total cholesterol was lower in non -Hispanic black men than in non-Hispanic white, non -Hispanic Asian, and His panic men, and lower in non -Hispanic black women than in non -Hispanic white and Hispanic women. Low HDL cholesterol prevalence was lower in non -Hispanic black and non -Hispanic Asian men and women than in Hispanic men and women; in non -Hispanic black men a nd women than in non -Hispanic white men and women; and in non -Hispanic Asian women than in non - Hispanic white women. From 2007 to 2014, the percentage of adults with high total and low HDL cholesterol declined. Approximately 12% of adults had high total cholesterol during the 4 -year period. Overall, the percentage with high total cholesterol was lowest for adults aged 20 -39 and highest for adults aged 40 -59: 7.5% for age group 20 -39, 12.9% for 60 and over, and 1 6.0% for 40 -59. The percentage of men with high total cholesterol was higher for those aged 40 -59 (15.3%) than for those aged 20 -39 (8.2%) or 60 and over (7.3%). The percentage of women with high total cholesterol was lower for those aged 20 -39 (6.8%) than for those aged 40 -59 (16.7%) or 60 and over (17.7%) (Figure 1). A lower percentage of men (10.6%) than women (13.0%) had high total cholesterol. The percentage with high total cholesterol did not differ by sex for those aged 20 -39 and 40 -59, but was low er for men aged 60 and over (7.3%) than for women in the same age group (17.7%). Overall, the percentage of adults with high total cholesterol was lower for non -Hispanic black (8.6%) than for non -Hispanic white (12.5%) and Hispanic (13.1%) adults. The same race and Hispanic -origin patterns were seen in men (7.3%, 10.8%, and 13.5%, respectively) and in women (9.6%, 13.8%, and 12.5%, respectively). Overall and for men, the prevalence of high total cholesterol was lower in non -Hispanic black than in non -Hispan ic Asian subgroups, but this difference was not seen in women. Non -Hispanic white women had higher prevalence of high total cholesterol (13.8%) than non -Hispanic white men (10.8%) (Figure 2). 83 84 More than 18% of adults aged 20 and over (27.9% of men an d approximately 10.0% of women) had low HDL cholesterol over the 4 -year period. Overall, the percentage of adults with low HDL cholesterol was lower among those aged 60 and over (15.3%) than among those aged 20 -39 (19.5%) or 40 -59 (19.8%). A lower percenta ge of men aged 60 and over (25.0%) than those aged 40 -59 (30.2%) had low HDL cholesterol. A lower percentage of women aged 60 and over (7.2%) had low HDL cholesterol compared with those aged 20 -39 (11.7%) or 40 -59 (9.9%). The percentage with low HDL choles terol was consistently lower in women than in men in each age group (Figure 3). Overall, the prevalence of low HDL cholesterol was lower in non -Hispanic black (13.6%) and non-Hispanic Asian (15.2%) adults than in non -Hispanic white (19.1%) and Hispanic (21.1%) adults. The prevalence of low HDL cholesterol was lower in non -Hispanic bla ck (20.7%) and non - Hispanic Asian (25.0%) men than in Hispanic (30.7%) men. A lower percentage of non -Hispanic black men had low HDL cholesterol compared with non -Hispanic white men (28.4%), but no difference was observed between non -Hispanic Asian and non -Hispanic white men. The prevalence of low HDL cholesterol was lower in non -Hispanic black (8.0%) and non -Hispanic Asian (6.7%) women than in non -Hispanic white (10.3%) or Hispanic (11.8%) women. The 85 percentage with low HDL cholesterol was consistently low er in women than in men of the same racial and ethnic group (Figure 4).

Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics. 2015. 86 NCHS Data Brief No. 226 December 2015 Cholesterol helps the body build new cells, insulate nerves and produce hormones. Howe ver, too much cholesterol in the blood can build up on the walls of arteries and block blood flow to vital organs such as the heart and brain, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. High cholesterol is also an indicator for diabetes, as elevated level s of cholesterol are seen in people with insulin resistance. High cholesterol is caused by excess fat \u2014 particularly trans fats \u2014 in the diet, being overweight or obese, lack of physical activity and cigarette smoking. High cholesterol tends to affect so me more than others. Age and genetic predisposition are important factors that contribute to high cholesterol. Poor nutrition, excessive intake of trans fats, lack of physical activity and cigarette smoking can also trigger high cholesterol or make treatin g high cholesterol more complicated. There are no symptoms of high cholesterol. Many people have never had their cholesterol checked and are unaware that they are at risk for the associated chronic diseases. Cholesterol levels can be determined with a simp le blood test. Preventing high cholesterol or lowering cholesterol levels if already high can be achieved through eating a healthy diet low in trans fats, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, not cigarette smoking and treating high cholester ol through medication. In Oregon, 64% of adults with diabetes and 67% of adults with heart disease or stroke have high cholesterol, compared with 33% of the general population. 87 Oregon adults with less than a high school education are 23% more likely to h ave high cholesterol and 24% less likely to have had a cholesterol screening in the past five years compared to Oregon adults with a college degree. During the last 20 years, high cholesterol in the Oregon adult population increased by 26%, from 26% in 19 90 to 33% in 2011. More than 1.1 million adults in Oregon have high cholesterol. The percentage of adults who have high cholesterol increased 27% during the past 20 years, from 25.8% in 1990 to 32.7% in 2011 . Fewer Oregon adults (32.7%) currently report hi gh cholesterol compared to the overall U.S. population (34.2%). However, the prevalence of high cholesterol among adults in Oregon and the United States has been fairly similar over time. More African American (38.3%) and American Indian/Alaska Native (38. 6%) persons reported high cholesterol compared to other racial and ethnic groups (Figure 2.4.11) The percentage of non -Latino African American persons who reported high cholesterol was 12.6% higher than non -Latino white persons (Figure 2.4.11). 88 Age-adjusted Prevalence of High Cholesterol Among Adults, by County, 2008 -2011 Clackamas 33.1% Multnomah 32.4% Oregon Dataset 2008 -2011 Note: Age-adjusted estimates are adjusted to the 2000 Standard Population using three age groups (18 -34, 35-54 and 55+) Age-adjusted Prevalence of High Cholesterol County, 2010 -2013 Clackamas 34.2% Multnomah 30.8% Oregon 31.8% Oregon Health Authority, Public Health Division, He alth Promotion and Chronic Disease Prevention section.

Abnormal Cholesterol Among Children and Adolescents in the United States, 2011 -2014 Duong Nguyen, D.O.; Brian Kit, M.D., M.P.H.; and Margaret Carroll, M.S.P.H. Approximately one out of five children and adolescents (21%) had at lea st one abnormal cholesterol measure (high total cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, or high non -HDL cholesterol). Of the three cholesterol measures examined in this report, low HDL cholesterol was the most common abnormality. In general, prevalence of high t otal cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, and high non -HDL cholesterol was greater in adolescents aged 16 -19 compared with children aged 6-8. Children and adolescents with obesity had the highest prevalence for all cholesterol measures examined, most notably with low HDL cholesterol where prevalence was five times greater among those with obesity than for those of normal weight, similar to previous studies. Some CVD risk factors, including cholesterol, track from childhood into adulthood. To identify children with abnormal cholesterol values, clinical practice guidelines endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend monitoring cholesterol for all children, including those aged 9 -11 years. In this analysis, 7.4% of children and adolescents aged 6 -19 had high total cholesterol. Continued monitoring of abnormal cholesterol levels among children and adolescents may inform public health interventions to promote long -term cardiovascular health and prevent CVD in adulthood. One in five youths had high total cholesterol, low high -density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, or high non -HDL cholesterol. Prevalence of low HDL cholesterol (13.4%) was greater than high non -HDL cholesterol (8.4%) or high total cholesterol (7.4%). 89 Preva lence of high total cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, and high non -HDL cholesterol was greater in adolescents than children. Girls had higher prevalence than boys for high total cholesterol and high non - HDL cholesterol, but lower prevalence for low HDL c holesterol. Youth with obesity had greater prevalence of high total cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, and high non -HDL cholesterol than youth of normal weight. The prevalence of high total cholesterol among U.S. children and adolescents was 7.4% (Figur e 1). The prevalence of high total cholesterol was greater among adolescents aged 16 -19 (8.9%) than children aged 6 -8 (6.0%). The prevalence of high total cholesterol was lower in boys (5.9%) than in girls (8.9%). The prevalence of high total cholesterol w as greater among non - Hispanic black and non -Hispanic Asian children and adolescents and lower among non -Hispanic white and Hispanic children and adolescents. The prevalence of high total cholesterol was greater in children and adolescents with obesity (11. 6%) than in those of normal weight (6.3%) and in those who were overweight (6.9%). Overall, 13.4% of all children and adolescents had low HDL cholesterol (Figure 2). There was an increasing age trend in the prevalence of low HDL cholesterol, from 7.7% for children aged 6 -8 to 18.4% for adolescents aged 16 -19. Boys (14.8%) had a higher prevalence of low HDL 90 cholesterol than girls (12.0%). Both non -Hispanic black (7.4% ) and non -Hispanic Asian (8.2%) children and adolescents had a lower prevalence of low HDL cholesterol than non -Hispanic white (14.4%) or Hispanic (15.6%) children and adolescents. The prevalence of low HDL cholesterol increased with increased body mass in dex (BMI). Furthermore, the prevalence of low HDL cholesterol among children and adolescents with obesity (33.2%) was almost five times higher than for children and adolescents of normal weight (6.8%). The overall prevalence of high non -HDL cholesterol among children and adolescents was 8.4% (Figure 3). The prevalence of high non -HDL cholesterol among adolescents aged 16 -19 was higher than among children and adolescents aged 6 -8, 9-11, and 12 -15, and no differences were seen between children and adolesce nts in the other age groups. The prevalence of high non-HDL cholesterol was greater in girls (9.4%) than in boys (7.5%), but did not differ among race and Hispanic origin groups. High non -HDL cholesterol prevalence increased with increased BMI, and the pre valence among children and adolescents with obesity (16.7%) was almost three times higher than children and adolescents of normal weight (5.7%). 91 The above children and adolescents' data from the NCHS Data Brief No. 228 December 2015 Nguyen DT, Kit BK , Carroll MD.

Products - Data Briefs - Number 228 - December 2015 92 High blood pressure (hypertension) High blood pressure is a common condition in which the long -term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. Blood pressure is determined both by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure. You can have high blood pressure (hypertension) for years without any symptoms. Even without symptoms, damage to blood vessels and your heart continues and can be detected. Uncontrolled high blood pressure inc reases your risk of serious health problems, including heart attack and stroke. High blood pressure generally develops over many years, and it affects nearly everyone eventually. Fortunately, high blood pressure can be easily detected. And once you know yo u have high blood pressure, you can work with your doctor to control. By Mayo Clinic Staff high blood pressure (hypertension) - Mayo Clinic High Blood Pressure in the United States Having high blood pressure puts you at risk for heart attack and stroke , which are leading causes of death in the United States. About 75 million American adults (32%) have high blood pressure \u2014that's 1 in every 3 adults . About 1 in 3 American adults has prehypertension \u2014blood pressure numbers that are higher than normal \u2014but not yet in the high blood pressure range. Only about half (54%) of people with high blood pressure have their condition under control. High blood pressure was a primary or contributing cause of death for more than 410,000 Americans in 2014 \u2014that's more than 1,100 deaths each day . High blood pressure costs the nation $48.6 billion each year. This total includes the cost of health care services, medications to treat high blood pressure, and missed days of work. 93 Risk Factors for High Blood Pressure Having certain medical conditions can increase your chances of developing high blood pressure. These conditions include Prehypertension (http://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/conditions.htm). Diabetes (http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/index.html). Unhealthy behaviors can also inc rease your risk for high blood pressure, especially for people who have one of the medical conditions listed above. Unhealthy behaviors include Smoking tobacco. Eating foods high in sodium (http://www.cdc.gov/salt) and low in potassium. Not getting enough physical activity. Being obese. Drinking too much alcohol High Blood Pressure Fact Sheet|Data & Statistics|DHDSP|CDC Oregon 2013 Adult Hypertension rate: 31.8% among states: 24/51 2010 Hypertension 2030 Projected Cases a t current rate: 989,454 Oregon Data Source: Oregon State Obesity Data, Rates and Trends: The State of Obesity 94 High blood pressure More than 900,000 adults in Oregon have high blood pressure. The percentage of Oregon adults with high blood pressure increased 33% during the past 20 years, from 20.7% in 1990 to 27.6% in 2011. Fewer Oregon adults (27.6%) report high blood pressure compared with the overall U.S. population (30.2%), which has been consistent over time. The percentage of African American persons who report high blood pressure was nearly double that of white persons. Diabetes also increases a person's risk for developing high blood pressure . Among adults with diabetes: 68% have high blood pressure; 73.2% of those with high blood pressure ar e taking medication for high blood pressure. Among adults surviving a heart attack: 50% have high blood pressure; 89% of those with high blood pressure are taking medication for high blood pressure. The proportion of adults with high blood pressure has bee n increasing over the last 15 years in Oregon and nationally. Fewer Oregon adults reported high blood pressure compared with the overall U.S. population, which has been consistent over time. From 1995 to 2011, the percentage of Oregonians with high blood p ressure increased by 16.5%. The prevalence of high blood pressure increases greatly with age. More than half of Oregonians aged 65 and older had been diagnosed with high blood pressure, compared to less than 13% of adults aged 18 -44. High blood pressure i s called the \"silent killer\" because many people don't realize they have it. High blood pressure often has no warning signs or symptoms. The only way to detect whether or not you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure measured by a doctor or health professional \u2014 it is quick and painless. Lowering blood pressure by changes in lifestyle \u2014 such as quitting cigarette smoking, exercising or taking medication \u2014 can lower the risk of heart disease and heart attack. 95 http://public.health.orego n.gov/DiseasesConditions/ChronicDisease/Documents/OHA8582_AllVolumes.pdf 96 Healthy People 2020 objective - Reduce the proportion of adults with hypertension to 26.9%. 97 Prehypertension Prehypertension is blood pressure that is slightly higher than normal. Prehypertension increases the risk that you will develop chronic, or long -lasting, high blood pressure in the future. If your blood pressure is between 120/80 mmHg and 139/89 mmHg, you have prehypertension. Learn more about how blood pressure is measured(http://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/measure.htm). You can take steps to control your blood pressure(http://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/control.htm) and keep it in a healthy range. Blood Pressure Levels Normal Systolic: less than 120 mmHg Diastolic: less than higher Diastolic: 90 mmHg or higher Conditions That Increase Risk for High Blood Pressure | cdc.gov 98 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a progressive disease that makes it hard to breathe. \"Progressive\" means the disease gets worse over time. COPD can cause coughing that produces large amounts of mucus (a slimy substance), wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and other symptoms. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of COPD. Most people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke. Long -term exposure to other lung irritants \u2014such as air pollution, chemical fumes, or dust \u2014also may contribute to COPD. What Is COPD? - NHLBI, NIH COPD includes two main illnesses: chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Most people who have COPD have both of these conditions. Chron ic lower respiratory disease, primarily COPD, was the third leading cause of death in the United States in 2011. Fifteen million Americans report that they have been diagnosed with COPD. More than 50% of adults with low pulmonary function were not aware th at they had COPD; therefore, the actual number may be higher. The following groups were more likely to report COPD: People aged 65 -74 years. Non -Hispanic whites. Women. Individuals who were unemployed, retired, or unable to work. Individuals with less than a high school education. People with lower incomes. Individuals who were divorced, widowed, or separated. Current or former smokers. Those with a history of asthma.

Women have higher rates of COPD than men throughout most of their lifespan, although it appears that they are especially vulner able before the age of 65. The profile of the \"typical\" woman with COPD is not that different from the \"typical\" man with the disease, and also looks a lot like the average smoker. She is most likely to be white, to reside in a southeastern or Appalachian state and to have an income below the poverty level. A small number of people have a rare inherited form of COPD called alpha -1 antitrypsin deficiency, which occurs about equally in women and men. Women with COPD experience the disease differently than me n, in ways that increase their burden. COPD is a disease that brings with it a heavy burden on patients and families. It often means years of poor health, lost productivity and costly healthcare expenses. Women with COPD have more frequent disease flare -ups, which are a sudden worsening of COPD symptoms that are often caused by a cold or other lung infection. These bouts of illness may require urgent care or emergency department visits, and sometimes hospitalization. Each flare up accelerates the progressiv e loss of breathing ability, eventually leading to long -term disability and death.\" Copyright \u00a92013 by the American Lung Association.

Asthma is a serious health and economic concern in the United States. It's expensive. Asthma costs the United States $56 billion each year. The average yearly cost of care for a child with asthma was $1,039 in 2009. In 2008, asthma caused: 10.5 mil lion missed days of school 14.2 million missed days of work It's common. In 2010: 18.7 million adults had asthma. That's equal to 1 in 12 adults. 7 million children had asthma. That's equal to 1 in 11 children. It's deadly. About 9 people die from asth ma each day. In 2009, 3,388 people died from asthma. What makes a person more likely to have asthma? Gender: Women are more likely to have asthma than men. In children, boys are more likely to have asthma than girls. Age: Adults ages 18 to 24 are more l ikely to have asthma than older adults. Race and ethnicity: Multi -race and black adults are more likely to have asthma than white adults. Black children are 2 times more likely to have asthma than white children. Education level: Adults who didn't finish high school are more likely to have asthma than adults who graduated high school or college. Income level: Adults with an annual household income of $75,000 or less are more likely to have asthma than adults with higher incomes. http://www.cdc.gov/asthma/ 102 National National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Adult Self -reported Asthma Prevalence Rate by State, BRFSS 2013 Table A -2a.

They also have greater percentage of smokers. In addition to the risk factors for the lower income population, the lack of medical insurance or assistance makes it difficult for those with asthma to afford the medications and care necessary to control their disease. Death rates due to asthma have consistently decreased since 1999. ____ ___________________________ In a 2013 report \"The Burden of Asthma\", by the Oregon Asthma Program, it is stated that in 2011, 10.8% of adults and 7.8% of children in Oregon had asthma, meaning that almost 387,000 Oregonians had asthma. The burden of asthma is both economic and personal, affecting the state with direct costs (e.g., hospitalizations and emergency department visits) and indirect costs (e.g., missed school and work days and days of restricted activity) as well as reducing the quality of life fo r people with asthma and their families. Asthma Risk Factors: One in four Oregonians with asthma is a smoker (25.3%), which is a higher percentage than among people who do not have asthma (20.0%). Tobacco smoke is an asthma trigger. People with asthma s hould not smoke or be exposed to secondhand smoke. Those who do smoke should be offered tobacco cessation assistance such as the Oregon Tobacco Quit Line. Adult Oregonians with asthma report lower exposure to secondhand smoke (13.3%) than those without asthma (18.3%). However, no one with asthma should be exposed. Over 94% of adults (those with or without asthma) report having rules against smoking in the home. A smaller percentage of adults with asthma (87.7%) and without asthma (89.1%) have rules against smoking in the car. A higher percent of extremely obese people reported having asthma (20.4%) than healthy weight individuals (8.5%). Most Oregonians with asthma live in homes with carpeting in the bedroom (78.7% of adults and 76.2% of childr en) and dogs in the home (69.3% of adults and 106 76.2% of children). In addition, many live in homes where there were wood burning stoves (34.3% of adults and 31.9% of children) or mold had been seen or smelled in the past 30 days (15.0% of adults and 11.3% o f children). These are all important indoor asthma triggers. Common asthma triggers include tobacco and other smoke, animals with fur or feathers, breathing cold air, pollen from trees, flowers, and plants, mold or mildew, and other sources. Direct costs associated with asthma include hospitalization and emergency visits. More than one out of four Oregon adults with asthma smoke, and 13% of non -smoking adults with asthma report being exposed to secondhand smoke, both of which are significant triggers for asthma. Conversely, although 94% of Oregon adults with asthma say they have rules against smoking in the home, many are exposed to secondhand smoke , a major asthma trigger. ________________________________ Data source: Oregon Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, National data from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

More than 50 million Americans suffer from allergies each year. Allergies are an overreaction of the immune system to substances that generally do not affect other individuals. These substances, or allergens, can cause sneezing, coughing, a nd itching. Allergic reactions range from merely bothersome to life -threatening. Some allergies are seasonal, like hay fever. Allergies have also been associated with chronic conditions like sinusitis and asthma. Who's at Risk? Anyone may have or develop a n allergy - from a baby born with an allergy to cow's milk, to a child who gets poison ivy, to a senior citizen who develops hives after taking a new medication. Can It Be Prevented? Allergies can generally not be prevented but allergic reactions can be. O nce a person knows they are allergic to a certain substance, they can avoid contact with the allergen. Strategies for doing this include being in an air-conditioned environment during peak hay -fever season, avoiding certain foods, and eliminating dust mite s and animal dander from the home. They can also control the allergy by reducing or eliminating the symptoms. Strategies include taking medication to counteract reactions or minimize symptoms and being immunized with allergy injection therapy. The Bottom L ine The most common allergic diseases include: hay fever, asthma, conjunctivitis, hives, eczema, dermatitis and sinusitis. Food allergies are most prevalent in young children and are frequently outgrown. Latex allergies are a reaction to the proteins in la tex rubber, a substance used in gloves, condoms and other products. Bees, hornets, wasps, yellow jackets, and fire ants can cause insect sting allergies. Allergies to drugs, like penicillin, can affect any tissue or organ in the body. Anaphylaxis is the most severe allergic reaction. Symptoms include flush; tingling of the palms of the hands, soles of the feet or lips; light -headedness, and chest -tightness. If not treated, these can progress into seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, shock, and respiratory distre ss. Anaphylaxis can result in death. Food, latex, insect sting, and drug allergies can all result in anaphylaxis.

An allergic condition is a hypersensitivity disorder in which the immune system reacts to substances in the environment that are normally considered harmless. Food or digestive allergies, skin allergies (such as eczema), and respiratory allergies (such as hay fever) are the most common allergies among children. Allergies can affect a child's physical and emotional health and can interfere with daily activities, such as sleep, play, and attending school . A severe allergic reac tion with rapid onset, anaphylaxis, can be life threatening. Foods represent the most common cause of anaphylaxis among children and adolescents. Early detection and appropriate interventions can help to decrease the negative impact of allergies on quality of life. 110 Among children aged 0 -17 years, the prevalence of food allergies increased from 3.4% in 1997 - 1999 to 5.1% in 2009 -2011. The prevalence of skin allergies increased from 7.4% in 1997 -1999 to 12.5% in 2009 -2011. There was no significant trend in re spiratory allergies from 1997 -1999 to 2009 -2011, yet respiratory allergy remained the most common type of allergy among children throughout this period (17.0% in 2009 -2011). Skin allergy prevalence was also higher than food allergy prevalence for each peri od from 1997 -2011 (Figure 1). Hispanic children had lower rates of all three types of allergies compared with children of other race or ethnicities. Non -Hispanic black children were more likely to have skin allergies and less likely to have respiratory all ergies compared with non -Hispanic white children. Hispanic children had a lower prevalence of food allergy (3.6%), skin allergy (10.1%), and respiratory allergy (13.0%) compared with non -Hispanic white and non -Hispanic black children. Non -Hispanic black c hildren had a higher percentage of reported skin allergy (17.4%) compared with non -Hispanic white children (12.0%) and a lower percentage of respiratory allergy (15.6%) compared with non -Hispanic white children (19.1%) (Figure 3). 111 Among children under ag e 18 years in the United States, the prevalence of food and skin allergies increased from 1997 -1999 to 2009 -2011. The prevalence of respiratory allergy, which is the most prevalent type of allergy among children, did not change during this period. There was no significant difference in food allergy prevalence between age groups. However, skin allergy decreased with the increase of age, and respiratory allergy increased with the increase of age. The prevalence of allergies varies by race and ethnicity, with Hispanic children having the lowest prevalence of food, skin, and respiratory allergies compared with non -Hispanic white and non - Hispanic black children. Non -Hispanic black children were more likely to have skin allergies and less likely to have respirato ry allergies compared with non -Hispanic white children. The prevalence of allergies differed by poverty status. Food allergy and respiratory allergy increased with the increase of income level, but there was no difference in the prevalence of skin allergy by poverty status. http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db121.pdf 112 113 Cancer According to the \"Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975 -2012, the overall cancer death rates in the U.S. decreased from 2003 -2012. CDC - Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975 -2012 Overall cancer death rates decreased during 2003 -2012 by: An average of 1.8 percent per year for men An average of 1.4 percent per year for women An average of 2 percent per year for people ages 0 to 19. \"Tren ds in mortality (cancer death rates) are the gold standard for evidence of progress against cancer. Below are 10 -year mortality trends for the most common cancers for men and women. These trends show that liver cancer is one of the few common cancers with increasing death rates and that its death rate is increasing the fastest among all common cancers.\" \"In addition to reporting rates and trends for the most common cancers, this year's report also includes a special section on liver cancer. Among both men a nd women, liver cancer deaths are on the rise in the United States, increasing at the highest rate of all common cancers during the period 2003 -2012.\" \" A major risk factor for liver cancer is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The incidence of new HCV inf ections was highest in the 1960s through 1980s, before the virus was discovered and preventive measures could be taken. Although risk of liver cancer for all people increases up to age 85, liver cancer incidence rates were higher among people born during 1 945-1965 than among those born in other periods because of higher rates of HCV infection in the 1945 -1965 birth cohort. Among persons born during 1945 -1965, rates of hepatitis C infection were highest among non -Hispanic whites, non -Hispanic blacks, and His panics.\" \"The incidence rate of liver cancer in the U.S. is higher in men than in women. \" During 2008 -2012, among both men and women, liver cancer incidence rates were highest among non -Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives, followed by non -Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders and then by Hispanics. The dominant liver cancer -related virus among Asian/Pacific Islanders is Hepatitis B virus (HBV), and infection with HBV is more common among Asians than among other racial groups, especially Asians who were b orn outside the United States. 114 Statistics at a Glance: The Burden of Cancer in the United States In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and 595,690 people will die from the disease. The most common cancer s in 2016 are projected to be breast cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, prostate cancer, colon and rectum cancer, bladder cancer, melanoma of the skin, non -Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid cancer, kidney and renal pelvis cancer, leukemia, endometrial cancer, and p ancreatic cancer. The number of new cases of cancer (cancer incidence ) is 454.8 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2008 -2012 cases). The number of cancer deaths (cancer mortality ) is 171.2 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2008 -2012 de aths). Cancer mortality is higher among men than women (207.9 per 100,000 men and 145.4 per 100,000 women). It is highest in African American men (261.5 per 100,000) and lowest in Asian/Pacific Islander women (91.2 per 100,000). (Based on 2008 -2012 deaths. ) The number of people living beyond a cancer diagnosis reached nearly 14.5 million in 2014 and is expected to rise to almost 19 million by 2024. Approximately 39.6 percent of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes (based on 2010 -2012 data). In 2014, an estimated 15,780 children and adolescents ages 0 to 19 were diagnosed with cancer and 1,960 died of the disease. National expenditures for cancer care in the United States totaled nearly $125 billion in 2010 and coul d reach $156 billion in 2020.

State Cancer Profiles > > Table 119 Cancer Trends Progress Report The Cancer Trends Progress Report summarizes our nation's progress against cancer in relation to Healthy People 2020 targets determined by the Department of Health and Human Services. Data were gathered from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for D isease Control and Prevention, other Federal agencies, professional groups, and cancer researchers. The report, available online only, is updated annually. Report Highlights Making Progress The nation is making progress toward major cancer -related targets for Healthy People 2020, a comprehensive set of 10 -year health objectives sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Prevention Adult cigarette smoking prevalence has been slowly declining since 1991, while smoking prevalence among adolescents has declined since the late 1990s. Substantial decreases in secondhand smoke exposure have been realized since the beginning of the 1990s for all subgroups and across a variety of measures. This includes biological measures, as well as work place policies, rules about smoking in the home, and, more recently, through state and local smoke -free indoor air legislation. More adults are focusing on physical fitness, which has the potential to reduce both cancer - and non-cancer -related morbidity. S tudies have shown that the percentage of adults who are meeting federal guidelines for aerobic and muscle -strengthening activity has risen consistently since the late 1990s. Adult sun protective behaviors (e.g., using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing , seeking shade) have risen slightly since 2005, though young adults, especially young men, show much lower levels of this behavior. Teen indoor tanning has decreased since 2005, and has decreased significantly among female high school students since 2009. Many states have enacted policies to control the indoor tanning industry, and some are restricting minors' access to indoor tanning facilities. Still, more than one in five young women have engaged in indoor tanning within the past 12 months. Diagnosis Estimates of cancer incidence for 2010 show that Healthy People 2020 targets were reached in 15 states for reduced colorectal cancer incidence, and in 24 states for reduced cervical cancer incidence. Overall breast cancer incidence rates have remained relati vely stable since 2004, and improvements in breast cancer treatment and early detection have helped lower death rates substantially since 1990. Colorectal cancer incidence rates have decreased steadily, with slight exceptions, since the mid - 1980s, and decl ines have accelerated in recent years. These declines have largely been attributed to increased col orectal cancer screening, which not only reduces incidence rates, but also increases the likelihood of survival. 120 Life after Cancer The majority of cancer survivors (64 percent) were diagnosed 5 or more years ago, and 15 percent were diagnosed 20 or more years ago. End of Life The rate of death from cancer continues to decline among both men and women, among all major racial and ethnic groups, and for the mo st common types of cancer, including lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancers. The death rate from all cancers combined continues to decline, as it has since the early 1990s. Length of cancer survival has increased for all cancers combined. The 5 -year rel ative survival rate for all cancers diagnosed between 2003 and 2009 is 68.0 percent, up from 66.7 percent in 2003. Improvement in survival must continue to meet the Healthy People 2020 objective for 5 -year survival of 72.8 percent. Areas of Concern The nation is losing ground in other important areas that demand attention. Prevention While smoking initiation rates have declined among adolescents aged 12 -17 years, initiation rates among those aged 18 -25 years have risen. While the percentage of smokers at tempting to quit smoking each year has recently risen and is now at 55 percent, successful quitting percentages have been low and recently have shown only slight improvement. In addition, Hispanics and non -Hispanic African Americans and those with low socioeconomic status are significantly less likely to receive cessation services. Although progress has been made in reducing exposure to secondhand smoke among all populations, children living below the poverty level and Black, non -Hispanic children were more likely than their peers to be living in homes where someone smoked regularly. Up to one -third of cancer cases in the United States are related to excess weight or obesity, physical inactivity, and/or poor nutrition, and thus could be prevented. Alcohol co nsumption, which can increase the risk of some cancers, has risen slightly since the mid - 1990s. More progress is needed to reach Healthy People 2020 targets for cancer screening tests that can identify breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer in early stage s. In 2010, the breast cancer screening rate was 72.4 percent (below the Healthy People 2020 target of 81.1 percent); cervical cancer screening was 83.0 percent (below the target of 93.0 percent); and colorectal cancer screening was 58.6 percent (below the target of 70.5 percent). Not enough children in the U.S. are being properly vaccinated against the cancer causing human papillomavirus, or HPV. Although most cervical cancers could be prevented through HPV vaccination and effective screening, only 33 perc ent of girls aged 13 -17 years received the recommended three - dose HPV vaccine series in 2012. Diagnosis Unexplained cancer -related health disparities remain among population subgroups. For example, the incidence of late -stage breast cancer is highest among Black women, who are less likely than White women to be diagnosed with local -stage breast cancer and generally have lower survival rates than White women within each stage. The incidence of some cancers, including kidney, thyroid, pancreas, liver, uterus, melanoma of the skin, myeloma (cancer of plasma cells), and non -Hodgkin lymphoma, is rising. 121 Lung cancer incidence rates in women continue to rise but not as rapidly as was seen from about 1975 to 1990. Life after Cancer Even for patients with health insu rance, out -of-pocket costs for cancer care often pose a significant financial burden. As the U.S. population ages and newer technologies and treatments become available, national expenditures for cancer continue to rise, potentially exceeding overall medic al care expenditures combined. http://progressreport.cancer.gov/ _____________________________________________ Lung Cancer \"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in both men and women in the United States. An estimated 224,210 new cases are expected to be diagnosed in 2014, accounting for almost 14 percent of all cancer diagnoses. 32 It has been shown that rises and declines in lung cancer incidence and mortality rates parallel past trends of cigarette smoking. It has been estimated that active smoking is responsible for close to 90 percent of lung cancer cases; radon causes 10 percent, occupational exposures to carcinogens account for approximately 9 to 15 percent and outdoor air pollution 1 to 2 percent. Because of the interactions between exposures, the combined attributable risk for lung cancer can exceed 100 percent. 33 Fiveyear survival rates are low compared to other common cancers at 16.8 percent. SmokingAttributable Lung Cancer Deaths The most important cause of lung cancer in the United States is cigarette smoking. It is estimated that 80 percent of lung cancer deaths in women and 90 percent in men, respectively, are caused by smoking. Compared to nonsmokers, men who smoke are 23 times more likely to develop lung cancer, w hile women are 13 times more likely. The risk increases with the duration of smoking and amount smoked per day. 28 Between 2005 and 2009, an average of 130,659 Americans (74,300 males and 56,359 females) died of smokingattributable lung cancer annually.\" Above fro m the American Lung Association' s \"Trends in Lung Cancer Morbidity and Mortality' November 2014 copyright 122 123 For additional information on Lung Cancer in African Americans, please see The American Lung Association's report: \" Too Many Cases, Too Many Deaths\" 124 125 Radon What is Radon? Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. It is formed by the natural breakdown of uranium in rock, soil and water. Radon gas moves up through the soil and can be drawn into our homes by slight pressure differences. Once inside, radon can become trapped and build up to unsafe levels. The U.S. Surgeon General warns that radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer a fter cigarette smoking and the number one cause of lung cancer in non -smokers. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that radon causes around 20,000 deaths from lung These estimates were prepared by Portland State University, Department of Geo logy. As we continue to analyze data and more people test their home for radon, we will update these resources. This data provided is for informational purposes only. It is compiled by the Oregon Public Health Division from long -term radon tests (more tha n 90 days), conducted primarily by homeowners. Indoor radon concentrations are influenced by weather, season, geology, type of construction and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Therefore in general, this data should not be used to substit ute for radon tests in homes. The Public Health Division recommends testing all residences, specifically the living areas, on a long -term basis, to evaluate the annual average concentration. When the annual average concentration in a living area of a home exceeds 4 pCi/liter, it is recommended that measures be taken to lower the concentration to below the 4 pCi/liter level. Additional information on testing, measurement services or mitigation contractors can be obtained from the Oregon Public Health Divisio n, Radon Information Line (971) 673 -0440cancer annually in the United States. http://public.health.oregon.gov/HealthyEnvironments/RadiationProtection/RadonGas/Pages/index.aspx Radon Risk in Oregon Indoor Radon Risk Levels The Oregon Public Health Division recommends that ALL residences be tested for radon regardless of the risk level assigned to the home's geographic location. You can easily test your home by following these steps recommended by EPA . If your radon levels are above 4 pCi/liter, the Public Health Division and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommend that further action be taken to lower the concentration below that level. 126 The data presented in the links below was compiled by the Oregon Public Health Division. It contains long - term radon tests (more than 90 days) and short -term radon tests (2 -90 days) that have been conducted primarily by homeowners. Indoor radon levels can be influenced by weather, season, geology, type of construction and heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Because of this, radon levels may not be consistent among a group of homes, even those next door to each other. *if your zip code has no risk level assigned, you may be eligible for a free test kit , call or email us today! To understand how the radon risk scores (green/yellow/red rankings) were determined; please review the last page of Table of Radon Risk Levels in Oregon by Zip Code (pdf) . Indoor radon concentrations are influenced by weather, season, geology, and type of construction as well as heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. The maps and table provided here s hould not be used to substitute for radon testing of an individual home. The only way to know if you have high radon levels in your home is to test YOUR home. The following Oregon counties have Radon Mitigation Code Requirements for new construction : Baker, Clackamas, Hood River, Multnomah, Polk, Washington, and Yamhill counties. The data used to make this map comes from long - and short -term radon te st results. These results are submitted to the Oregon Radon Program by test kit manufacturers. The level of radon risk for each zip code is based on the maximum result, the average of all results and the percent of locations within the zip code with a re sult of 4 pCi/L or greater. What do the colors mean? The color is a general indication of risk from indoor radon. Red is the highest level of risk. Green is the lowest. Yellow is in between. 127 128 Breast Cancer This section is from http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/BreastCancer/DetailedGuide/breast -cancer - key-statistics What are the key statistics about breast cancer? Breast cancer is the mo st common cancer among American women, except for skin cancers . About 1 in 8 (12%) women in the US will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime. Current year estimates for breast cancer The American Cancer Society's estimates for breast cancer in the United States for 2016 are: About 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women. About 61,000 new cases of carcinoma in situ (CIS) will be diagnose d (CIS is non -invasive and is the earliest form of breast cancer). About 40,450 women will die from breast cancer. Trends in breast cancer incidence After increasing for more than 20 years, breast cancer incidence rates in women began decreasing in 2000, and dropped by about 7% from 2002 to 2003. This large decrease was thought to be because fewer women used hormone therapy after menopause after the re sults of the Women's Health Initiative were published in 2002. This study linked using hormone therapy to an increased risk of breast cancer and heart diseases. In recent years, incidence rates have been stable in white women, but have increased slightly in African American women. Trends in breast cancer deaths Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. (Only lung cancer kills more women each year.) The chance that a woman will die from breast cancer is about 1 in 36 (about 3%). Death rates from breast cancer have been dropping since about 1989, with larger decreases in women younger than 50. These decreases are believed to be the result of finding breast cancer earlier through screening and increased awareness, as well as better t reatments. 129 Breast cancer survivors At this time, there are more than 2.8 million breast cancer survivors in the United States. (This includes women still being treated and those who have completed treatment.) Survival rates are discussed in \" Breast cancer survival rates by stage.\" Visit the American Cancer Society's Cancer Statistics Center for more key statistics.

The data presented here are from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which defines any mental illness (AMI) as: o A mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder (excluding developmental and substance use disorders); o Diagnosable currently or within the past year; and, o Of sufficient duration to meet diagnostic criteria specified within the 4th edition of the Diagnostic a nd Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -IV). AMI can range in impact from no or mild impairment to significantly disabling impairment, such as in individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), defined as individuals with a mental disorder with serious functional impairment which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities. As noted, these estimates of AMI do not include substance use disorders, such as drug - or alcohol -related disorders. For statistics and other information about drug - and alcohol -related disorders, please visit the statistics pages of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), and the Substance Abuse a nd Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). In 2014, there were an estimated 43.6 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States with AMI in the past year. This number represented 18.1% of all U.S. adults. NIMH \u00bb Any Mental Illness (AMI) Among U.S. Adults 139 Serious Mental Illness (SMI) Among U.S. Adults While mental disorders are common in the United States, their burden of illness is particularly concentrated among those who experience disability due to serious mental illness (SMI). The data presented here are from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which defines SMI as: o A mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder (excluding developmental and substance use disorders); o Diagnosable currently or within the past year; o Of sufficient d uration to meet diagnostic criteria specified within the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM -IV); and, o Resulting in serious functional impairment, which substantially interferes with or limits one or more major lif e activities. In 2014, there were an estimated 9.8 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States with SMI. This number represented 4. 1% of all U.S. adults. NIMH \u00bb Serious Mental Illness (SMI) Among U.S. Adults 140 The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) reports in their Mental Illness Fact s and Numbers brief the following: Prevalence of Mental Illness Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. \u201443.8 million, or 18.5% \u2014experiences mental illness in a given year. Approximately 1 in 25 adults in the U.S. \u201410 million, or 4.2% \u2014experiences a serious mental illness in a given year that substantially interferes with or limits one or more major life activities. Approximately 1 in 5 youth aged 13 -18 (21.4%) experiences a severe mental disorder at some point during their life. For children aged 8 -15, the e stimate is 13%. 1.1% of adults in the U.S. live with schizophrenia. 2.6% of adults in the U.S. live with bipolar disorder. 6.9% of adults in the U.S. \u201416 million \u2014had at least one major depressive episode in the past year. 18.1% of adults in the U.S. experie nced an anxiety disorder such as posttraumatic stress disorder, obsessive -compulsive disorder and specific phobias. Among the 20.2 million adults in the U.S. who experienced a substance use disorder, 50.5% \u201410.2 million adults \u2014had a co -occurring mental illn ess. Social Stats An estimated 26% of homeless adults staying in shelters live with serious mental illness and an estimated 46% live with severe mental illness and/or substance use disorders. Approximately 20% of state prisoners and 21% of local jail prisoners have \"a recent history\" of a mental health condition. 70% of youth in juvenile justice systems have at least one mental health condition and at least 20% live with a serious mental illness. Only 41% of adults in the U.S. with a mental health cond ition received mental health services in the past year. Among adults with a serious mental illness, 62.9% received mental health services in the past year. Just over half (50.6%) of children aged 8 -15 received mental health services in the previous year. African Americans and Hispanic Americans used mental health services at about one - half the rate of Caucasian Americans in the past year and Asian Americans at about one- third the rate. Half of all chronic mental illness begins by age 14; three -quarters by a ge 24. Despite effective treatment, there are long delays \u2014sometimes decades \u2014between the first appearance of symptoms and when people get help. -NAMI: National Alliance on Mental Il lness | Mental Health By the Numbers 141 It is reported in the BRFSS and Trends Data that 20.1% of adults in the U.S. are limited in any activities because of physical, mental, or emotional problems in 2012.

Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and is the fifth leading cause among people aged 65 years and over. People aged 85 years and over have a 5.4 times greater risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease than people aged 75-84 years. The risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease is 26 percent higher among the non - Hispanic white population than among the non -Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30 percent lower risk than the non -Hispanic white population. In 2010, among all states and the Dis trict of Columbia, 31 states showed death rates from Alzheimer's disease that were above the national rate (25.1). http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db116.pdf 143 http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_038.pdf 144 Suicide Suicide is a significant problem in the United States: 41,149 people killed themselves in 2013. Over 494,169 people with self -inflicted injuries were treated in U.S. emergency departments in 2013. Suicides result in an estimated $44.6 billion in co mbined medical and work loss costs.1 These numbers underestimate this problem. Many people who have suicidal thoughts or make suicide attempts never seek services. Suicide, by definition, is fatal and is a problem throughout the life span. In 2013, suicide was the second leading cause of death among persons aged 15 -24 years, the second among persons aged 25 -34 years, the fourth among person aged 35 -54 years, the eig hth among persons aged 55-64 years, the seventeenth among persons 65 years and older, and the tenth leading cause of death across all ages. There is no single cause of suicide. Several factors can increase a person's risk for attempting or dying by suicid e. However, having these risk factors does not always mean that suicide will occur. Risk factors for suicide include: Previous suicide attempt(s) History of depression or other mental illness Alcohol or drug abuse Family history of suicide or vio lence Physical illness Feeling alone Suicide affects everyone, but some groups are at higher risk than others. Men are about four times more likely than women to die from suicide. However, women are more likely to express 145 suicidal thoughts and to make nonfatal attempts than men. The prevalence of suicidal thoughts, suicide planning, and suicide attempts is significantly higher among young adults aged 18 -29 years than it is among adults aged 30 years.3 Other groups with higher rates of suicidal behavior include American Indian and Alaska Natives, rural populations, and active or retired military personnel. Note: This is only some information about risk. To learn more, go to http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/suicide.html. http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/suicide_factsheet -a.pdf Suicide was the tenth leading cause of death for all ages in 2013. There were 41,149 suicides in 2013 in the United States \u2014a rate of 12.6 per 100,000 is equal to 113 suicides each day or one every 13 minutes. Based on data about suicides in 16 National Violent Death Reporting System states in 2010, 33.4% of suicide decedents tested positive for alcohol, 23.8% for antidepressants, and 20.0% for opiates, including heroin and prescriptio n pain killers. Suicide results in an estimated $51 billion in combined medical and work loss costs. Among students in grades 9 -12 in the U.S. during 2013 17.0% of students seriously considered attempting suicide in the previous 12 months (22.4% of fe males and 11.6% of males). 13.6% of students made a plan about how they would attempt suicide in the previous 12 months (16.9% of females and 10.3% of males). 8.0% of students attempted suicide one or more times in the previous 12 months (10.6% of female s and 5.4% of males). 2.7% of students made a suicide attempt that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or an overdose that required medical attention (3.6% of females and 1.8% of males). Males take their own lives at nearly four times the rate of females and represent 77.9% of all suicides. Females are more likely than males to have suicidal thoughts. 146 Suicide is the seventh leading cause of death for males and the fourteenth leading cause for females. Firearms are the most commonly used method of suicide among males (56.9%). Poisoning is the most common method of suicide for females (34.8%). Racial and Ethnic Disparities Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death among American Indians/Alaska Natives across all ages. Among American Indians/ Alaska Natives aged 10 to 34 years, suicide is the second leading cause of death. The suicide rate among American Indian/Alaska Native adolescents and young adults ages 15 to 34 (19.5 per 100,000) is 1.5 times higher than the national average for that ag e group (12.9 per 100,000). The percentages of adults aged 18 or older having suicidal thoughts in the previous 12 months were 2.9% among blacks, 3.3% among Asians, 3.6% among Hispanics, 4.1% among whites, 4.6% among Native Hawaiians /Other Pacific Islan ders, 4.8% among American Indians/Alaska Natives, and 7.9% among adults reporting two or more races. Among Hispanic students in grades 9 -12, the prevalence of having seriously considered attempting suicide (18.9%), having made a plan about how they would attempt suicide (15.7%), having attempted suicide (11.3%), and having made a suicide attempt that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that required medical attention (4.1%) was consistently higher than white and black students. Among adults ag ed 18 -22 years, similar percentages of full -time college students and other adults in this age group had suicidal thoughts (8.0 and 8.7%, respectively) or made suicide plans (2.4 and 3.1%). Full -time college students aged 18 -22 years were less likely to attempt suicide (0.9 vs. 1.9 %) or receive medical attention as a result of a suicide attempt in the previous 12 months (0.3 vs. 0.7%). http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/suicide -datasheet -a.pdf 147 In 2012 -2013, young adult males aged 18 -24 were more likely than young adult females to commit suicide. This relationship was found for the five race and ethnicity groups studied (non - Hispanic white, non -Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander [API], and American Indian or Alaska Native [AIAN]). The suicide rate was highest in the AIAN population for both males and females (34.3 and 9.9 deaths per 100,000 population, respectively). AIAN males were more than twice as likely to commit suicide as most other gender and racial and ethnic subgroups. Sui cide rates for AIAN young adults are likely to be underestimated; a previous study found that deaths overall for the AIAN population were underreported by 30%. Based on combined data from 2009 through 2013 for non -Hispanic black and non -Hispanic white young adults who committed suicide, firearms were the most common method used, 148 followed by suffocation. For Hispanic, API, and AIAN young adults who committed suici de, suffocation was the most common method used, followed by firearms. Poisoning and falls were more common methods among API young adults who committed suicide (12.6% and 8.1% of suicide deaths, respectively) than among other race and ethnicity groups.

Tobacco use and smoking do damage to nearly every organ in the human body, often leading to lung cancer, respiratory disorders, heart disease, stroke, and other illnesses. In 2014, an estimated 66.9 million Americans aged 12 or older were current users of a tobacco product (25.2%). Young adults aged 18 to 25 had the highest rate of current use of a tobacco product (35%), followed by adults aged 26 or older (25.8%), and by youths aged 12 to 17 (7%). In 2014, the prevalence of current use of a tobacco product was 37.8% for American Indians or Alaska Natives, 27.6% for whites, 26.6% for blacks, 30.6% for Native Hawaiians or other Pacific Islanders, 18.8% for Hispanics, and 10.2% for Asians. Smoking Prevalence is Much Higher Among People with a Mental Illness Nationally, nearly 1 in 5 adults (or 45.7 million adults) hav e some form of mental illness, and 36% of these people smoke cigarettes. In comparison, 21% of adults without mental illness smoke cigarettes. (Mental illness is defined here as diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional conditions and does not include d evelopmental and substance use disorders.) There are other troubling statistics from the report: 31% of all cigarettes are smoked by adults with mental illness. 40% of men and 34% of women with mental illness smoke. 48% of people with mental illness who li ve below the poverty level smoke, compared with 33% of those with mental illness who live above the poverty level. You can read more about smoking prevalence among people with mental illness in the Vital Signs Report. 152 What Contributes to Higher Smoking Prevalence in this Population? While many mental health providers and facilities have made progress in reducing smoking in their facilities and among their patients, others are just now beginning to address tobacco use. Because they are more focused on tre ating the mental illness of their patients, some providers and facilities may not consider smoking to be a problem, or ignore it. Smoking can cause unique issues for people with mental illness. Nicotine has mood -altering effects that put people with mental illness at higher risk for cigarette use and nicotine addiction. However, recent research has shown that adult smokers with mental illness \u2014like other smokers \u2014want to quit, can quit, and benefit from proven stop -smoking treatments. These treatments need to be made available to people with mental illness and tailored as needed to address the unique issues this population faces. What Can Be Done to Reduce Smoking Among People with Mental Illness? Mental Health Professionals : Find out if patients smoke. Someti mes patients aren't asked whether they smoke when beginning mental health treatment. If they do smoke, offer to help patients quit by providing proven quitting treatments, including referring them to the toll -free 1 -800-QUIT -NOW quitline, the Web site www.smokefree.gov , or other resources. Make quitting tobacco part of an approach to mental health treatment and overall wellness. Mental health professionals should be especially aware of the behavior changes that may occur when withdrawing from nicotine, and should make sure that their patients are aware of them. Medicines used to treat mental illness may need to be monitored and adjusted for people with mental illness who are trying to quit tobacco use. Mental Health Facilities: Include tobacco cessation treatments as part of an overall mental health treatment strategy. Make mental health facilities and campuses completely tobacco -free (no use of any tobacco product by anyone anywhere inside or outside at any time). Call attention to and stop practices that encourage tobacco use (e.g., providing cigarettes to patients, allowing smoking as a reward, selling tobacco products on site, and allowing staff to smoke with patients). http://www.cdc.gov/features/ vitalsigns/smokingandmentalillness/ 153 Co-occurring Disorders People with mental health disorders are more likely than people without mental health disorders to experience an alcohol or substance use disorder. Co -occurring disorders can be difficult to diagnose due to the complexity of symptoms, as both may vary in severity. In many cases, people receive treatment for one disorder while the other disorder remains untreated. This may occur because both mental and substance use disorders can have biologica l, psychological, and social components. Other reasons may be inadequate provider training or screening, an overlap of symptoms, or that other health issues need to be addressed first. In any case, the consequences of undiagnosed, untreated, or undertreate d co -occurring disorders can lead to a higher likelihood of experiencing homelessness, incarceration, medical illnesses, suicide, or even early death. Many people in the criminal justice system have co -occurring disorders. Providing integrated treatment t o address mental and substance use disorders can lead to positive outcomes such as reduced substance use and arrests. Failure to effectively screen and assess inmates with co - occurring disorders is a major concern in the criminal justice system. Co-occur ring disorders are common among people experiencing homelessness. This population often has a variety of issues that require services beyond behavioral health treatment, such as life skills development, employment assistance, and housing. While treating p eople experiencing homeless who are suffering from co -occurring disorders through integrated care is important to recovery , few have access to it. People experiencing homelessness may be isolated or have littl e to no access to health and behavioral health services, and therefore their health issues may go undiagnosed or untreated. This can lead to chronic homelessness and further deterioration in physical and behavioral health, as well as social and economic functioning. Co-occurring disorders, such as post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use, is prevalent among veterans and the military community. According to the Veterans Affairs Department (VA), approximately one -third of veterans seeking treatment for substance use disorders also met the criteria for PTSD. Veterans and service members benefit from integrated care for mental and substance use disorders. However, some veterans may not seek medical treatment for one of many reasons, including a fear of being treated differently. http://www.samhsa.gov/disorders/co -occur ring 154 The Health Consequences of Smoking \u201450 Years of Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General The century -long epidemic of cigarette smoking has caused an enormous, avoidable public health catastrophe in the United States. Since the first Surgeon Gene ral's report on smoking and health was published 50 years ago, more than 20 million Americans have died because of smoking. If current rates continue, 5.6 million Americans younger than 18 years of age who are alive today are projected to die prematurely f rom smoking -related disease. Most of the 20 million smoking -related deaths since 1964 have been adults with a history of smoking; however, 2.5 million of those deaths have been among nonsmokers who died from diseases caused by exposure to secondhand smoke. More than 100,000 babies have died in the last 50 years from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, complications from prematurity, complications from low birth weight, and other pregnancy problems resulting from parental smoking. The tobacco epidemic was initiate d and has been sustained by the tobacco industry, which deliberately misled the public about the risks of smoking cigarettes. Despite significant progress since the first Surgeon General's report, issued 50 years ago, smoking remains the single largest cau se of preventable disease and death in the United States. Smoking rates among adults and teens are less than half what they were in 1964; however, 42 million American adults and about 3 million middle and high school students continue to smoke. Nearly half a million Americans die prematurely from smoking each year. More than 16 million Americans suffer from a disease caused by smoking. On average, compared to people who have never smoked, smokers suffer more health problems and disability due to their smoki ng and ultimately lose more than a decade of life. The estimated economic costs attributable to smok ing and exposure to tobacco smoke continue to increase and now approach $300 billion annually, 155 with direct medical costs of at least $130 billion and produ ctivity losses of more than $150 billion a year. The scientific evidence is incontrovertible: inhaling tobacco smoke, particularly from cigarettes, is deadly. Since the first Surgeon General's Report in 1964, evidence has linked smoking to diseases of near ly all organs of the body. In the United States, smoking causes 87 percent of lung cancer deaths, 32 percent of coronary heart disease deaths, and 79 percent of all cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). One out of three cancer deaths is ca used by smoking . This report concludes that smoking causes colorectal and liver cancer and increases the failure rate of treatment for all cancers. The report also concludes that smoking causes diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and immune system weak ness, increased risk for tuberculosis disease and death, ectopic (tubal) pregnancy and impaired fertility, cleft lip and cleft palates in babies of women who smoke during early pregnancy, erectile dysfunction, and age -related macular degeneration. Secondha nd smoke exposure is now known to cause stroke s in nonsmokers. This report finds that in addition to causing multiple serious diseases, cigarette smoking diminishes overall health status, impairs immune function, and reduces quality of life. Smokers today have a greater risk of developing lung cancer than did smokers in 1964. Even though today's smokers smoke fewer cigarettes than those 50 years ago, they are at higher risk of developing lung cancer. Changes in the design and composition of cigarettes since the 1950s have increased the risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung, the most common type of lung cancer. Evidence suggests that ventilated filters may have contributed to higher risks of lung cancer by enabling smokers to inhale more vigorously, thereby draw ing carcinogens contained in cigarette smoke more deeply into lung tissue. 156 At least 70 of the chemicals in cigarette smoke are known carcinogens. Levels of some of these chemicals have increased as manufacturing processes have changed. For the first time, women are as likely to die as men from many diseases caused by smoking. Women's disease risks from smoking have risen sharply over the last 50 years and are now equal to men's for lung cancer, COPD, and cardiovascular diseases. The number of women dying fr om COPD now exceeds the number of men. Evidence also suggests that women are more susceptible to develop severe COPD at younger ages. Between 1959 and 2010, lung cancer risks for smokers rose dramatically. Among female smokers, risk increased 10 -fold. Amon g male smokers, risk doubled. The Health Consequences of Smoking \u201450 Years of Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General | SurgeonGeneral.gov 157 158 State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System: State Highlights | OSH | CDC 159 Current cigarette smoking among Oregon adults has decreased over recent years. Since 2010, smoking prevalence among Oregon adults has decreased 14%. However, cigarette smoking continues to be a significant risk factor among Oregon adults. Approximately 519,100 Oregonians smoke cigarettes. When smokeless tobacco is included, this number increases to approximately 604,600 adult tobacco users in Oregon. The burden of tobacco use falls hardest on lower -income Oregonians and certain racial and ethnic groups, who use tobacco at higher rates and suffer the harshest consequences in terms of chronic disease burden. Tobacco use prevalence among adults is nearly twice as high among African Americans and American Indian/Alaskan Natives than among the general population (33.3%, 35.3% and 17.8%, respectively). Rates of tobacco use are almost twice as high among adults of low socioeconomic status than among the gener al population (33.7%, 17.8%). Cigarette smoking prevalence among Oregon adults with less than a high school education is four times higher than among those who have graduated from college. Tobacco prevalence is also higher among Oregon adults enrolled in Medicaid; 29.3% of Oregon adults enrolled in Medicaid smoke cigarettes. https://public.health.oregon.gov/About/Documents/ship/oregon -state -health -improvement -plan.pdf The following Citation is from the \"State of Tobacco Control 2016\" American Lung Associat ion Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States. To address this enormous toll, the American Lung Association and its partners have committed to three bold goals: 1. Reduce rates of smoking and tobacco use to less than 10% for all communities by 2024; 2. Protect all Americans from secondhand smoke by 2019; and 3. Ultimately eliminate the death and disease caused by tobacco use. The American Lung Association in O regon recognizes that these bold goals will only be met in Oregon if the following three actions are taken by our elected officials: 1. Increase funding for tobacco prevention and control efforts; 2. Increase tobacco taxes; and 3. Raise the legal sales age for tobacco products to 21. 160 Prior to the 2015 legislative session, Oregon was one of very few states remaining to allow the sale of electronic smoking devices to persons under age 18. During the 2015 legislative session, Rep. Kathleen Taylor introduced H ouse Bill 2546 to address this problem. The American Lung Association in Oregon and its partners stood strong with legislative champions and the legislation was approved in both houses of the legislature and signed into law. In addition to prohibiting sale s of electronic smoking devices and accessories to minors, the legislation also includes electronic smoking devices in Oregon's Indoor Clean Air Act. Maintaining tobacco prevention funding is a perennial objective for Oregon's tobacco prevention coalition . In the 2013 -2015 biennium, a little over $4 million had been allocated to Oregon's tobacco prevention and cessation program from the tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), in addition to funding from tobacco tax revenue the program has received for m any years. Joining together with other advocates, the Lung Association was able to secure that same $4 million from the tobacco MSA for the 2015 to 2017 biennium to maintain current funding levels for the state program for the next two years. The American Lung Association in Oregon will continue to seek opportunities to increase its tobacco taxes, maintain and increase tobacco control program funding and raise the legal sales age for tobacco products to 21 years old. 161 State Highlights | American Lung Association To get involved with the American Lung Association, please contact: American Lung Association in Oregon 7420 SW Bridgeport Rd., Suite 200 Tigard, OR 97224 503 -924-4094 www.lung.org/oregon Youth use of e -cigarettes has increased dramatically Current use of e -cigarettes (i.e., in the last month) among Oregon eleventh -graders has almost tripled recently: from 1.8% in 2011 to 5.2% in 2013, even as cigarette smoking appears to decline. This mimics national trends of current e -cigarette use among high school students overall (1.5% in 2011 to 2.8% in 2012). Among Multnom ah County high school students in 2012: 10.1% have ever used an e -cigarette, similar to high school students nationally (10.0%). 3.9% currently use e -cigarettes, not significantly different than high school students nationally (2.8%). Youth are very aware of e -cigarettes and many perceive them as less harmful than regular cigarettes In Multnomah County, more than half (55.1%) of the high school students perceived e - cigarettes as less harmful than regular cigarettes (CPPW YRBS 2012). 162 E-cigarette use m ay lead to regular cigarette use Indirect evidence both locally and nationally suggests that e -cigarette use may lead to use of regular cigarettes: In Multnomah County in 2013, among eighth - and eleventh -graders who do not currently smoke: those who curr ently use e -cigarettes are nearly three times as likely to intend to smoke regular cigarettes (49%) than those who do not use e -cigarettes (17%) (p<.01). Similar patterns are seen nationally among middle and high school students who do not currently smok e: those students who had ever used e -cigarettes were twice as likely to intend to smoke (44%) than students who had never used e -cigarettes (22%) (2011 -2013). Many youth who currently use e -cigarettes also use regular cigarettes In Multnomah County, current smoking is much more common among high school students who currently use e -cigarettes (47%) than among high school students who do not currently use e -cigarettes (5%) (2012).

This percentage in 2014 was higher than those in every year from 2002 through 2013. The illicit drug use estimate for 2014 continues to be driven primarily by marijuana use and the nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers, with 22.2 million current marijuana users aged 12 or older (i.e., users in the past 30 days) and 4.3 million people aged 12 or older who reported current nonmedical use of prescription pain relievers. The higher percentage of people who were c urrent illicit drug users in 2014 than in prior years appears to reflect trends in marijuana use. The percentage of people aged 12 or older in 2014 who were current marijuana users (8.4 percent) also was greater than the percentages in 2002 to 2013. In add ition, the estimate of current marijuana use was greater in 2014 than the estimates in 2002 to 2009 for young adults aged 18 to 25 and in 2002 to 2013 for adults aged 26 or older. Although nonmedical pain reliever use continued to be the second most commo n type of illicit drug use in 2014, the percentage of people aged 12 or older in 2014 who were current nonmedical users of pain relievers (1.6 percent) was lower than the percentages in most years from 2002 to 2012, but it was similar to the percentage in 2013. Percentages for current nonmedical use of pain relievers also were lower in 2014 than in 2002 to 2011 for adolescents aged 12 to 17 and in 2002 to 2012 for young adults aged 18 to 25. The use of many types of other illicit drugs has not increased in recent years. However, the percentage of people aged 12 or older in 2014 who were current heroin users was higher than the percentages in most years from 2002 to 2013\". The estimated 27.0 million people aged 12 or older who were current illicit drug user s in 2014 represent 10.2 percent of the population aged 12 or older ( Figure 2 ). Stated another way, 1 in 10 individuals aged 12 or older in the United States used illicit drugs in the past month. The percentage of people aged 12 or older who were current i llicit drug users in 2014 was higher than the percentages from 2002 to 2013. The rise in illicit drug use among those aged 12 or older since 2002 may reflect an increase in illicit drug use by adults aged 26 or older and, to a lesser extent, increases in i llicit drug use among young adults aged 18 to 25 relative to the years before 2009. Aged 12 to 17 Slightly more than 2.3 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 in 2014 were current users of illicit drugs, which represents 9.4 percent of adolescents ( Figure 2 ). The 2014 percentage was lower than the percentages from 2002 to 2004 and was similar to the percentages between 2005 and 2013. In 2002, for example, 11.6 percent of adolescents used an illicit drug in the past month. Aged 18 to 25 More than 1 in 5 young adults aged 18 to 25 (22.0 percent) were current users of illicit drugs in 2014 ( Figure 2 ). This percentage corresponds to about 7.7 million young adults in 165 2014 who were current users of illicit drugs. The percentage of young adults who were current illic it drug users was stable between 2009 and 2014. However, the 2014 estimate was higher than the estimates from 2002 through 2008. Aged 26 or Older In 2014, 8.3 percent of adults aged 26 or older were current users of illicit drugs ( Figure 2 ), or about 17.0 million adults in this age group. The percentage of adults aged 26 or older who were current illicit drug users in 2014 was higher than the percentages from 2002 to 2013. 166 Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality.

This represents 9.4 percent of the population aged 12 or older. Marijuana was the most commonly used illicit drug, with 19.8 million current users aged 12 or older (7.5 percent). There were 6.5 million nonmedical users of prescription -type drugs (2.5 percent), including 4.5 million nonmedical users of prescription pain relievers (1.7 percent). There were 1.5 million current cocaine users aged 12 or older, or 0.6 percent of the population. An estimated 1.3 million individuals aged 12 or older in 2013 (0.5 percen t) used hallucinogens in the past month. An estimated 496,000 individuals aged 12 or older were current inhalant users, which represents 0.2 percent of the population. There were about 289,000 current heroin users aged 12 or older, or 0.1 percent of the po pulation. In 2013, there were 2.2 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 who were current illicit drug users. This represents 8.8 percent of adolescents. In 2013, 7.1 percent of adolescents were current users of marijuana, 2.2 percent were current nonmedical users of prescription -type drugs (including 1.7 percent who were current nonmedical users of pain relievers), 0.6 percent were current users of hallucinogens, 0.5 percent were current users of inhalants, 0.2 percent were current users of cocaine, and 0.1 percent were current users of heroin. There were 22.4 million adults aged 18 or older who currently used illicit drugs in 2013. This represents 9.4 percent of adults. In 2013, 7.6 percent of adults were current users of marijuana, 2.5 percent were curre nt nonmedical users of prescription -type drugs (including 1.7 percent who were current nonmedical users of pain relievers), 0.5 percent were current users of hallucinogens, 0.6 percent were current users of cocaine, 0.2 percent were current users of inhala nts and 0.1 percent were current users of heroin. 174 Illicit Drug Use in Past Month among Persons Aged 12 or Older by State: Percentages, Annual Averages Based on 2006 and 2007 NSDUHs Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality.

Illicit Drug Use in the Past Month among Youths Aged 12 to 17 , by State: Percentages, Annual Averages Based on 2013 and 2014 NSDUHs 176 Opiate Misuse According to the Multnomah County Health Department's December 2015 report \"Opiate Trends - Multnomah County, 2004 -2014 ,\" Deaths from opiate overdose occurred more than twice a week in 2014 (109 deaths). While unacceptably high, this figure is a substantial improvement from three deaths per week in 2011 (156 deaths). The decrease in opiate deaths reflects a decrease in heroin -related deaths, which have dropped by more than 30% since 2011. Prescription opiate deaths have not decreased. In 2014, half of all fatal overdoses were associated with prescript ion opiates. Deaths represent only a fraction of the overdoses occurring. Ambulances responded to opiate overdoses in Multnomah County more than a dozen times per week (632 times in 2014). The expanded availability of naloxone, a drug that reverses opi ate overdose, has had a significant effect on overdose outcomes. More than 1,000 lay people in Multnomah County were trained to reverse overdoses using naloxone in 2014 and they reported more than 450 overdose reversals. 177 Opiates are the most rapidly grow ing reason for substance misuse treatment in Multnomah County and in Oregon. Heroin Deaths Over the six -year period, a larger number of deaths included heroin as a cause than prescription opiates. A smaller subset of deaths involved both heroin and prescription opiates. The total number of deaths involving any opiate has fluctuated, but has dropped for three consecutive years since 2011. Statistically, in 2014 there were significantly fewer opiate -related deaths compared to 2011 and to the median num ber of deaths from the previous five years. This suggests this decrease is significant and not likely to be explained by chance alone. Prescription Opiate Deaths Prescription -opiate related deaths have fluctuated slightly over the past six years but witho ut any clear trend. In 2014, the number of deaths associated with prescription opiates equaled those of heroin deaths. Sex: Two-thirds of opiate -related deaths occurred among men between 2009 and 2014. Race: From 2009 to 2014, there was minimal fluctuation in the proportion of opiate -related deaths accounted for by different racial and ethnic groups in Multnomah County. In all years, white residents accounted for over 88% of deaths. Age: The median age of in dividuals whose deaths involved prescription opiates was on average higher (range: 43 -51 years) than those whose deaths involved heroin (range: 35 -44 years). 178 Heroin -related Deaths by Age In 2009, more heroin -related deaths occurred among 35 -54 year olds compared to those under 35 or over 55 years. Since 2012, heroin -related deaths have been dropping among those 35 -54. In 2010 and 2011, heroin -related deaths rose among those under 35 years before dropping again in 2013. There was then a small increase in d eaths in this age group in 2014. Deaths among adults over 55 account for the smallest proportion of heroin -related deaths in the county . Death rates associated with any opiate types (prescription, heroin, or both) have been consistently higher in Multnom ah County compared to the rest of the state. In 2011, opiate death rates peaked for both heroin and prescription opiates. Trends in Multnomah County Between 2004 and 2009, opiate treatment admissions across all addictions services described in the Methods section remained stable but then increased between 2010 and 2013. Overall, there were 19% more admissions in 2013 than in 2004. The majority of treatment admissions during the reporting period were for heroin, but there was a greater proportional i ncrease in the number of clients admitted for prescription opiate treatment. The number of individuals receiving outpatient and residential treatment remained stable until 2008, but then increased by more than 10% each year through 2012. By 2013, the numb er of individuals receiving treatment had increased by more than 107% compared with 2004. In 2013, nearly 1,000 individuals received treatment for heroin use, a 46% increase compared to 2004. For prescription opiate treatment there was a 73% increase in th e same period from 75 individuals to 280. From 2004 through 2008, Multnomah County residents made up 58 -61% of the state's heroin admissions each year but gradually dropped to 43% in 2013. At the same time, Oregonians from other counties surpassed Multnom ah County residents for heroin treatment admissions for the first time in 2012, making up 57% of total admissions by 2013. The same trend occurred for prescription opiates. In 2004, Multnomah County residents represented 29% of the state's admissions for p rescription opiates but only 19% in 2013 (not shown). At the same time, residents of other counties increased from 71% to 81% of those admissions. Overall, 54% of the state's opiate admissions (heroin and prescription opiates combined) in 2004 were among M ultnomah County residents, compared to only 36% by 2013 . The above information is from the Multnomah County Health Department's December 2015 report \"Opiate Trends - Multnomah County, 2004 -2014\" 179 Heroin Use Disorder About 586,000 people aged 12 or older in 2014 had a heroin use disorder, which represents 0.2 percent of the people aged 12 or older ( Figure 38 ). Although the percentage of people aged 12 or older in 2014 who were current heroin users was higher than the percentages in most years between 2002 and 2013 ( Figure 12 ), the percentage of people aged 12 or older with a heroin use disorder remained steady from 2011 to 2014. However, the percentage in 2014 was higher than the percentages in 2002 to 2010 (0.1 percent in each year). Aged 12 to 17 An esti mated 0.1 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 17 in 2014 had a heroin use disorder in the past year ( Figure 38 ), which corresponds to about 18,000 adolescents. The percentage of adolescents with a heroin use disorder remained stable from 2002 to 2014. Aged 18 to 25 Approximately 168,000 young adults aged 18 to 25 in 2014 had a heroin use disorder in the past year, which represents 0.5 percent of young adults ( Figure 38 ). The percentage of young adults with a heroin use disorder in 2014 was greater than the p ercentages in 2002 to 2009, but it was similar to the percentages in 2010 to 2013. Aged 26 or Older In 2014, approximately 400,000 adults aged 26 or older had a heroin use disorder in the past year, which represents 0.2 percent of adults aged 26 or older (Figure 38 ). Between 2002 and 2014, 0.1 to 0.2 percent of adults aged 26 or older had a heroin use disorder in the past year. Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality. (2015).

This number of past month marijuana users corresponds to 8.4 percent of the population aged 12 or older. The percentage of people aged 12 or older who were current marijuana users in 2014 was higher than the percentages from 2002 to 2013. This rise in marijuana use among those aged 12 or older may reflect the increase in marijuana use by adults aged 26 or older and, to a lesser extent, increases in marijuana use among young adults aged 18 to 25 compared with the percentages of young adults who reported marijuana use in 2002 to 2009. Aged 12 to 17 In 2014, 7.4 percent of adolescents aged 12 to 17 were current users of marijuana. This means that approximately 1.8 million adolescents used marijuana in the past month. The percentage of adolescents in 2014 who were current marijuana users was similar to the percentages in most years between 2003 and 2013. Aged 18 to 25 An estimated 6.8 million young adults aged 18 to 25 in 2014 were current users of marijuana. This number corresponds to about 1 in 5 young adults (19.6 percent) who used marijuana in the past month. The percentage of young adults who were current marijuana users in 2014 was stable compared with the percentages between 2010 and 2013. However, the 2014 estimate was higher than the estimates from 2002 through 2009. Aged 26 or Older In 2014, 6.6 percent of adults aged 26 or older were current users of marijuana, which represents about 13.5 million adults in this age group. The percentage of adults aged 26 or older who were current marijuana users in 2014 was higher than the percentages from 20 02 to 2013. 184 Source:http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH -FRR1 -2014/NSDUH -FRR1 -2014.pdf 185 186 National Trends from Office of National Drug Control Policy: (Fact Sheet 2010) There has been a 103% increase in the potency of seized marij uana from 1998 -2008. Rates of marijuana used among 8th, 10th and 12th graders are higher than rates from any other illicit drug. Rates of marijuana use among young adults have risen by 105 from 2008 to 2009. In 2008, nearly 68 percent of primary treatment admissions for youth between the ages of 12 and 17 were for marijuana. Fewer youth today see marijuana as \"great risk\" in using. In 1991, approximately 80 percent of 8th, 10th and 12th graders perceived there to be a \"great risk\" in using marijuana regular ly. In 2009, those rates dropped to about 70% of 8th graders, 60 % of 10th graders, and 55% of 12th graders. The main active chemical in marijuana is delta -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Investigations have shown that THC changes the way in which sensory inf ormation gets into the hippocampus. It has been shown that THC suppresses neurons in the information -processing system of the hippocampus. It has also been shown that learned behaviors also deteriorate. Continuing to smoke marijuana can lead to abnormal fu nctioning of lung tissue injured or destroyed by marijuana smoke. Marijuana users inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in the lungs. The amount of tar inhaled by marijuana smokers and the level of carbon monoxide absorbed are three to five times greater than among tobacco smokers. 187 Illicit Drug Use in Past Month and Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana in Past Month in Oregon among Persons Aged 12 or Older, by Substate Region: Percentages, Annual Averages Based on 2010 -2012 NSDUHs State/Substate Region Illicit Drug Use in Past Month Illicit Drug Use Other Than Marijuana in Past Month Marijuana Use in the Past Year Cocaine Use in the Past Year Estimate 95% Prediction Estimate 95% Prediction Estimate 95% Prediction Estimate 95% Prediction Interval Interval Interval Interval Oregon 13.3 (11.75 - 15.03) 4.21 (3.42 - 5.19) 16.66 (14.97 2.54) Region 1 (Multnomah) (15.96 23.40) 5.29 (3.84 - 7.25) 23.65 27.71) 3.25 - 4.63) 3.54 (2.58 - 4.84) 13.79 (11.41 16.57) 1.56 - 2.26) Region 3 12.49 (10.48 - 14.82) 4.41 (3.40 2.39) Region 4 (8.83 - 14.28) 3.70 (2.58 - 5.27) 13.97 (11.22 - 17.26) 1.55 (1.03 - 2.32) Region 5 (Central) 10.31 (7.61 - 13.79) 3.94 (2.73 - 5.66) 13.2 (10.24 - 16.84) 1.53 (1.01 - 2.30) Region 6 (Eastern) 10.16 (7.23 - 14.09) 3.80 (2.58 - 5.56) 12.19 (8.86 - 16.55) 1.59 (1.02 - 2.46) Source: SAMHSA, Office of Applied Studies, National Surve y on Drug Use and Health, 2010 -2012.

Much less often, HCV transmission occurs among HIV -positive persons, especially MSM, as a result of sexual contact with an HCV -infected partner (30, 31), among persons who receive tattoos in unregulated settings (31), and among infants born to HCV -infected mothers (32). After adjustment for populations not sampled in the NHANES household surveys, such a s incarcerated and homeless populations, an estimated 3.5 million persons are living with HCV infection in the United States . After receiving reports of cases of acute hepatitis C ranging from 781 -877 during the years 2006 -2010, reported cases of acute HCV infection increased more than 2.5 times from 2010 - 2014. Cases of acute HCV infection rose annually, from 850 in 2010 to 1,232 in 2011, 1,778 in 2012, 2,138 in 2013, and 2,194 in 2014. The increase from 2010 -2014 is thought to reflect both true increases i n incidence and, to a lesser extent, improved case ascertainment. Based on new epidemiologic studies, at least 4.6 million persons are HCV -antibody positive and approximately 3.5 million are currently infected with HCV (13). New cases of HCV infection are predominately among young persons who are white, live in non -urban areas (particularly in Eastern and Midwestern states), have a history of injection -drug use, and previously used opioid agonists such as oxycodone (14). Improved case ascertainment by Flori da, Massachusetts, and New York, which were funded by CDC to conduct enhanced surveillance, partially explains the increased incidence of acute HCV infection in these states. In other locations where the number of cases has increased markedly (e.g., Kentuc ky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia), increases have occurred without any federal support for investigation or follow -up, reflecting overall increases in incidence (15, 16). After adjusting for under -ascertainment and under - reporting (2), an estimat ed 30,500 new HCV infections occurred in 2014. Mortality among HCV -infected persons \u2014primarily adults aged 55 -64 years \u2014is increasing. For the first time in the United States in 2007 , the number of HCV -related of HIV/AID S-related deaths (n=12,734) and has since continued to increase. The number of HCV -related deaths rose to 19,659 in 2014 and more than one -half of deaths occurred among persons aged 55 -64 years. A key public health challenge is to increase the proportion o f persons tested, and of those who are currently infected, increase the proportion referred for care and treatment. To address this challenge the USPSTF joined with CDC in 2013 to recommend one -time testing for HCV infection among adults born during 1945 - 1965. 190 What is the incidence of HCV infection in the United States? In 2014, a total of 2,194 cases of acute hepatitis C were reported to CDC from 40 states. The overall incidence rate for 2014 was 0.7 cases per 100,000 population, an increase from 2010 - 2012. After adjusting for under -ascertainment and under -reporting, an estimated 30,500 acute hepatitis C cases occurred in 2014. What is the prevalence of chronic HCV infection in the United States? An estimated 2.7 -3.9 million people in the United States ha ve chronic hepatitis C. Who is at risk for HCV infection? The following persons are at known to be at increased risk for HCV infection: Current or former injection drug users, including those who injected only once many years ago Recipients of clotting factor concentrates made before 1987, when more advanced methods for manufacturing those products were developed Recipients of blood transfusions or solid organ transplants before July 1992, when better testing of blood donors became available Chronic hemo dialysis patients Persons with known exposures to HCV, such as o health care workers after needlesticks involving HCV -positive blood o recipients of blood or organs from a donor who tested HCV -positive Persons with HIV infection Children born to HCV -positive mothers What is the prevalence of HCV infection among injection drug users (IDUs)? The most recent surveys of active IDUs indicate that approximately one third of young (aged 18 - 30 years) IDUs are HCV -infected. Older and former IDUs typically have a much h igher prevalence (approximately 70% -90%) of HCV infection, reflecting the increased risk of continued injection drug use. The high HCV prevalence among former IDUs is largely attributable to needle sharing during the 1970s and 1980s, before the risks of bl oodborne viruses were widely known and before educational initiatives were implemented. 191 Is cocaine use associated with HCV transmission? There are very limited epidemiologic data to suggest an additional risk from non -injection (snorted or smoked) cocaine use, but this risk is difficult to differentiate from associated injection drug use and sex with HCV -infected partners. Content source: Division of Viral Hepatitis and National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention HCV FAQs for Hea lth Professionals | Division of Viral Hepatitis | CDC Acute hepatitis C cases declined from 2000 through 2005, and remained stable from 2005 until 2010. From 2010 -2014, there was an approximate 2.6 -fold increase in the number of reported acute hepatitis C cases from 850 to 2,194 cases, respectively. 192 From 2000 -2002, incidence rates for acute hepatitis C decreased among all age groups, except for persons aged 0 -19 years; rates remained fairly constant among all age groups from 2002 -2010. From 2 010 to 2014, the rate of acute hepatitis C increased among persons aged 20 -29, 30-39 and 60 years. The largest increases were among persons aged 20 -29 years (from 0.75 cases per 100,000 population in 2010 to 2.20 cases per 100,000 population in 2014) and persons aged 30 -39 years (from 0.60 cases per 100,000 population in 2010 to 1.66 cases per 100,000 population in 2014). In 2014, among all age groups, persons aged 20 -29 years had the highest rate (2.20 cases per 100,000 population) and persons aged 0 -19 and 60 years had the lowest rate (0.12 cases per 100,000 population) of acute hepatitis C . Approximately 90% of U.S. deaths from viral hepatitis are caused by infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV). In 2013, for the first time, deaths associated with H CV infection surpassed the total number of deaths from 60 other nationally notifiable infectious diseases ( 1). In 2014, the HCV -related incidence rate and mortality rate among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations were approximately twofold gre ater than the comparable rates for the general population. Hepatitis Awareness Month and Testing Day \u2014 May 2016. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2016;65:461. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6518a1 193 Rates of acute hepatitis C decreased among males and females from 2000 -2003 and remained fairly constant from 2004 -2010. From 2010 -2014, rates of acute hepatitis C increased among males and females; in 2014, rates among males and females were 0.8 and 0.7 cases per 100,000 population, respectively From 2002 -2010, the incidence rate of acute hepatitis C for American Indians/Alaska Natives remained high relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Incidence rates have since increased for all racial/ethnic populat ions. From 2010 -2014, acute hepatitis C rates increased among all racial/ethnic groups except among Asian and Pacific Islanders. In 2014, rates of acute hepatitis C among American Indians/Alaska Natives; Asians/Pacific Islanders; Black, non -Hispanic; Whi te, non -Hispanic; and Hispanics were 1.32, 0.07, 0.19, 0.84, and 0.25 cases per 100,000 population, respectively. 194 In 2014, a total of 34 states notified CDC of 162,863 case -reports of past or present hepatitis C. Thirteen states (Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York State, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia) accounted for 76.4% of the past/present hepatitis C case -reports submitted through NNDSS i n 2014. Of the three types of viral hepatitis (hepatitis A, B, and C), hepatitis C accounted for the greatest number of deaths and the highest mortality rate, at 5.0 deaths/100,000 population in 2014. The overall hepatitis C -related mortality rate increa sed from 4.7 deaths/100,000 population in 2010 to 5.0 deaths/100,000 population in 2014. From 2010 -2014, the age group with the highest hepatitis C -related mortality rate was persons aged 55 -64 years (25.0 deaths/100,000 population in 2014). This group accounted for 50.9% of hepatitis C -related deaths in 2014. In 2014, the racial/ethnic group with the highest hepatitis C -related mortality rate was among American Indians/Alaska Natives (11.2 deaths/100,000 population). From 2010 -2014, the hepatitis C -related mortality rate among American Indians/Alaska Natives increased by 13%. In 2014, the hepatitis C -related mortality rate for males was approximately 2.6 times the rate for females. 195 From the May 2015 Oregon Health Authority Report: Viral Hepatitis in Oregon In 2005, positive laboratory test results of HCV (referred to as \"chronic\" infections, likely representing persons who acquired HCV sometime in the past) became reportable in Oregon. Between 2009 and 2013, Acute and Communicable Disease Prevention received 25,437 reports of persons with positive laboratory HCV tests, with an average annual number of 5,087. Compared to acute cases of HCV, persons with positive laboratory reports were more likely to be male (61%) and over age 40 (79%). AI/ANs and blac ks and African Americans had the highest rates of HCV laboratory reports in this time; their rates (127.7 cases /100,000 and 124.4 cases/100,000) were both more than twice the rate seen in whites during the same time (57.5 cases/100,000). The lowest rates were found among Hispanics (20.8 cases/100,000). Neither the OHA nor local health departments typically have resources to investigate persons reported with positive laboratory tests for HCV. However, a study conducted in Lane, Marion and Multnomah counties in 2011 -2012 found that 77% of persons with positive laboratory reports who received follow -up investigation reported injection drug use. 196 Rates of acute infection with HCV (for which no vaccine is available) between 2009 and 2013 were stable over the sam e period. HCV infections were most common in younger adults; nearly half of the cases were in persons less than 30 years of age. Injection drug use was the predominant route of transmission, accounting for 64% of interviewed cases. The average rate of acut e HCV in Oregon was 50% higher than the national rate in 2007 - 2011. The highest rates were in AI/ANs (2.1 cases/100,000), who had rates three times higher than whites (0.6 cases/100,000) and blacks and African Americans (0.6 cases/100,000) in Oregon. The volume of laboratory reports of positive HCV tests is more than 10 times higher than for chronic HBV, averaging 5,087 reports per year in the last five years. The majority of cases are male (61%) and over the age of 40 (79%); both AI/ANs and blacks and Af rican Americans had rates of positive HCV laboratory reports that were twice as high as in whites. Like acute cases, the majority of persons interviewed reported injection drug use at some point in their lives. _______________________________________ HCV testing is recommended for those who: Currently inject drugs; Ever injected drugs, including those who injected once or a few times many years ago; Have certain medical conditions, including persons: Who received clotting factor concentrates produced be fore 1987; Who were ever on long -term hemodialysis; With persistently abnormal alanine aminotransferase levels (ALT); Who have HIV infection. Were prior recipients of transfusions or organ transplants, including persons who: Were notified that they received blood from a donor who later tested positive for HCV infection; Received a transfusion of blood, blood components or an organ transplant before July 1992. HCV testing based on a recognized exposure is recommended for: Health care, emergency med ical and public safety workers after needle sticks, sharps or mucosal exposures to HCV -positive blood; Children born to HCV -positive women. Added in 2012: one -time testing of persons born between 1945 and 1965 (without ascertainment of risk factors). _______________________________________ Rates of acute HCV cases in Oregon were 50% higher than the national rate during 2007 -2011. Injection drug use accounted for the majority of new HCV infections in Oregon. Rates of acute HCV in Oregon were four times higher in AI/ANs than in any other racial group. 197 Table 9.

Most hospitalizations (62%) were in persons whose insurance payer was either Medicare or Medicaid. Half of liver transplants performed at OHSU in the past five years were due to HCV. 201 Between 2009 and 2013, the h ighest mortality rates from HCV occurred in two groups: AI/ANs and blacks and African Americans. Both were roughly twice the rate of whites. The mortality rate in Oregon from HCV was nearly twice the national average in 2011 . The majority of Oregon H BV chronic cases occur in persons born outside of the United States and were likely acquired at birth or in childhood. In 2009 -2013, 59% of Oregon's chronic HBV cases occurred in Asians and PIs. Chronic HBV is more common in Asian and PI women than in women of other races. Nearly two -thirds (63%) of Oregon's liver cancer cases associated with HBV infection were among Asians and PIs. Asians and PIs accounted for a quarter of deaths from HBV infection between 2008 and 2012. Rates of acute HBV among blacks and African Americans in Oregon from 2009 -2013 did not differ from other racial or ethnic groups. However, chronic HBV was more than 20 times higher in blacks and African Americans than in whites. The majority of cases of chronic HBV among blacks and Afri can Americans in Oregon are among persons born in Africa (78%). Cases of chronic HBV and liver cancer associated with HBV are more common in blacks and African Americans than in whites in Oregon. 202 Chronic HCV infection is more common in blacks and African A mericans than in whites in Oregon. Among blacks and African Americans, 64% of chronic HCV cases occur in men and 67% in persons aged 40 -59. Liver cancer and deaths from HCV are nearly twice as common in blacks and African Americans compared to whites. Rates of acute HCV in Oregon are more than three times higher in AI/ANs than any other racial group. The highest rates of chronic HCV in Oregon are seen in AI/ANs and blacks and African Americans. Hospital discharge data from the Indian Health Service (IHS) found a three -fold increase in HCV -related hospitalizations between 1995 and 2007. In Oregon, AI/ANs are twice as likely to die from HCV as whites. 203 204 http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/HIVSTDViralHepatitis/AdultViralHepatitis/Documents/Viral_Hepatitis_Epi_Pro file.pdf 205 Sexually Transmitted Disease A number of individual risk behaviors (such as higher numbers of lifetime sex partners), as well as environmental, social and cultural factors (such as higher prevalence of STDs or difficulty accessing quality health care) contribute to disparities in the sexual health of gay and bisexual men. For example, gay and bisexual men with lower econo mic status may have trouble accessing and affording quality healthcare, making it difficult to receive STD testing and other prevention services. Additionally, complex issues like homophobia and stigma can also make it difficult for gay and bisexual men to find culturally -sensitive and appropriate care and treatment . http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/std -trends -508.pdf Surveillance data shows both the numbers and rates of reported cases of chlamydia and gonorrhea continues to be highest among young people aged 15-24. Both young men and young women are heavily affected by STDs \u2014 but young women face the most serious long -term health consequences. It is estimated that undiagnosed STDs cause more than 20,000 women to become infertile each year. The 2014 data also show that youth are still at the highest risk of acquiring an STD, especially chlamydia and gonorrhea. Despite being a relatively small portion of the sexually active population, young people between the ages of 15 and 24 accounted for the highest rates o f chlamydia and gonorrhea in 2014 and almost two thirds of all reported cases. Additionally, previous estimates suggest that young people in this age group acquire half of the estimated 20 million new STDs diagnosed each year. STDs on the Rise Press Releas e | 2015 | Newsroom | NCHHSTP | CDC 206 http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/CommunicableDisease/DiseaseSurveillanceData/ST D/Pages/index.aspx Chlamydia Chlamydia trachomatis (i.e., chlamydia) is primarily a sexually transmitted bacterial infection. The majority of infections lack visible symptoms that are not recognized for months. Symptoms commonly include painful urination, vaginal discharge and pelvic pain, among others. Untreated chlamydia can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) an d infertility or tubal pregnancy in women. If detected, chlamydia can be treated successfully with antibiotics; this prevents long -term health consequences and sex partners from getting chlamydia. Unlike gonorrhea, chlamydia is not resistant to antibiotics . Chlamydia is the most common reportable illness in Oregon. More than 13,000 cases occurred in 2012. Rates of chlamydia are highest among: Women; Men and women aged 15 -24; and Blacks and African Americans. Chlamydia can be treated with antibiotics. 207 Physicians and other health care providers can help stop its spread by prescribing antibiotics for sex partners of people with chlamydia. They can do this even if they have not examined the partner. This is called expedited partner therapy (EPT). Increase d screening and improved laboratory tests have likely caused an increase in reported cases since 2003.

Women are more likely to become infected with gonorrhea after exposure. However, women are less likely than men to develop symptoms after infection and before they are tested. Gonorrh ea can cause serious complications. These include pelvic inflammatory disease that sometimes leads to infertility or tubal pregnancy in women. Infections that spread can cause very rare cases of arthritis and blisters on the skin in either sex, but such in fections are very rare. Untreated gonorrhea during pregnancy can cause premature delivery. Sometimes it can be hard to see the difference between symptoms caused by gonorrhea and those caused by chlamydial infection. Gonorrheal and chlamydial infections co mmonly occur at the same time. A total of 1,469 cases of gonorrhea were reported in Oregon during 2012. Gonorrhea rates ranged from 25 to 45 cases per 100,000 Oregon residents per year during 2002 -2012. These rates were well below the overall U.S. rates. Overall reported rates of gonorrhea are higher in men than in women. The highest rates occur among men and women in their 20s. Rates remain higher for men starting at age 20. At least 42% of men with reported cases of gonorrhea report having had sex with other men. Although cephalosporin is the preferred antibiotic treatment for gonorrhea, its effectiveness appears to be declining. This might become a major problem because no clear alternatives exist for treating gonorrhea. 211 Oregon STD Statistics Oregon Public Health Division statewide mandatory reporting of syphilis cases: http://public.health. oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/CommunicableDisease/DiseaseSurveillanceData/Pages/annrep.aspx 212 Gonorrhea cases among persons aged 15-19 years, by race, ethnicity and sex, Oregon, 2008-2013*,,\u00b6 Year cases rate cases rate cases rate cases rate cases rate cases rate T otal gonorrhea (ages 15-19) 239 94 246 98 200 79 229 92 189 77 181 73 male 75 57 87 67 61 47 68 53 69 54 85 67 female 164 133 159 130 139 112 161 133 120 100 96 80 American Indian/Alaska Native 3 52 5 89 3 40 4 54 7 95 3 41 male 1 33 1 34 0 0 1 26 3 78 0 0 female 2 73 4 149 3 84 3 85 4 114 3 85 Asian or Pacific Islander 5 44 5 43 3 22 4 29 7 50 3 22 male 3 53 1 17 0 0 3 44 4 58 3 43 female 2 35 4 68 3 44 1 15 3 43 0 0 African American/Black 66 824 79 955 67 739 73 797 43 470 30 328 male 31 752 43 1,027 24 500 17 350 13 268 16 330 female 35 899 36 881 43 1,008 56 1,303 30 698 14 326 White 137 60 137 61 93 42 113 52 107 50 111 51 male 29 25 36 31 28 24 38 34 37 33 48 43 female 108 98 101 92 65 60 75 71 70 67 63 60 Hispanic (may be any race) 30 82 24 63 15 35 29 66 23 51 24 53 male 7 35 5 24 4 18 12 52 10 43 11 47 female 23 138 19 108 11 53 17 81 13 60 13 60 Not Hispanic (may be any race) 209 96 222 104 185 88 200 98 166 82 157 78 male 68 61 82 76 57 53 56 53 59 57 74 72 female 141 132 140 134 128 124 144 144 107 109 83 85 *Source: Orpheus, January 2, 2014; totals may differ from section to section due to missing data (particular for race) NCHS bridged-race estimates for 2012 were used as a proxy for 2013 (since NCHS 2013 estimates were not yet available).

Oregon state law requires health providers and laboratories to report syphilis cases to the local health department. People with syphilis often go through long periods when they have no symptoms Primary syphilis \u2014 Usually consists of a single sore that lasts one to five weeks. Syphilis is most infectious during this period. It can be transmitted by direct contact, most often during sex. Blood tests for syphilis are often not positive until three weeks or more after exposur e. Sometimes the sore goes unnoticed. Secondary syphilis \u2014 Secondary syphilis does not follow in every case. When present, it appears about four weeks after the sore disappears. It includes rashes of the skin, mouth and genitals and swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms last one to six weeks and then disappear, even without treatment. People with secondary syphilis are infectious. Latent syphilis \u2014 There are no symptoms during this stage. Latent syphilis may go undetected for a lifetime or be followed in a few years by late (tertiary) syphilis. Blood tests are positiv e throughout latent infection. Late (tertiary) syphilis \u2014 This stage occurs in 30% to 40% of untreated people with primary syphilis. Late syphilis can cause disabilities such as dementia, balance and sensory problems. Congenital syphilis \u2014 This is wh en a fetus acquires syphilis in the womb or during delivery. Congenital syphilis is rare because most pregnant women are tested for syphilis. It may cause miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death. It can also cause the child to be chronically disabled. Neurologic complications \u2014 Neurologic complications can occur at any stage of syphilis including meningitis or ocular disease in primary and secondary and early latent syphilis, or dementia and peripheral nerve damage in late stages of syphilis. 'Neurosyp hilis' is not considered a stage of syphilis. Oregon's rate of early syphilis infections greatly increased during the last eight years. There were 0.7 cases per 100,000 people in 2007 and 10.5 cases per 100,000 people in 2014. This represents a 1500% inc rease. Increases continue during 2015. During 2014, people with HIV accounted for 42% of Oregon's new early syphilis cases. In the last decade, at least 64% of Oregon's early syphilis cases have occurred in men who have sex with men. 214 Early syphilis cases by county of residence, 2014 Multnomah County, 223 cases (29.1 per 100,000) Washington County, 54 cases (9.7 per 100,000) Clackamas County, 16 cases (4.1 per 100,000) Lane County, 23 cases (6.5 per 100,000) Marion County, 31 cases (9.6 per 100,0 00) Remaining 31 counties, total of 69 cases http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/CommunicableDisease/DiseaseSurveillanceData/STD/Docume nts/9984 -STD-Syphilis -Final.pdf 215 Troubling rise in syphilis infections among men, particularly gay and bisexual men Gay and Bisexual Men Face Highest - and Rising - Number of Syphilis Infections Trend data show rates of syphilis are increasing at an alarming rate (15.1 percent in 2014). While rates have increased among both men and women, men account for more than 90 percent of all primary and secondary syphilis cases. Men who have sex with men (MSM)* account for 83 percent of male cases where the sex of the sex partner is known. Primary and secondary syphilis are the most infectious stages of the disease, and if not adequately treated, can lead to long -term infection which can cause visual impairment and stroke. Syphilis infection can also place a person at increased risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection. Available surveillance data indicate that an average of half of MSM who have syphilis are also infected with HIV. http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/std -trends -508.pdf 216 During 2014, 41% of syphilis infections occurred among pe ople who already had HIV infection. For additional resources and information see: http://public.health.oregon.gov/DiseasesConditions/ HIVSTDViralHepatitis/SexuallyTransmittedDisease/ Pages/index.aspx 217 HIV/AIDS The following is from the \"Epidemiologic profile of HIV/AIDS in Oregon\" Report The rate of new HIV/AIDS infections by year of earliest reported diagnosis reached a high of 19 cases per 100,000 Oregon residents, a total of 542 cases, in 1991. The following year, however, saw the beginning of a dec line. By 1997 the rate dropped to 9 cases per 100,000, and continued to decline steadily to a level of 7 cases per 100,000 in 2012. Oregon's decline in new diagnoses during the 1990s reflected similar trends throughout the United States. These declines pro bably resulted from a combination of factors, including earlier diagnosis, behavior changes, reduction in infection from a pregnant woman to her baby, and reduced infectiousness of HIV -infected people taking antiretroviral therapy. In Oregon, men are more likely to be infected than women. From 2008 through 2012, diagnosis rates in Oregon were 7 times higher among men relative to women (12.1 vs. 1.6 per 100,000). Men who have had sex with men (MSM) accounted for 72% of all male cases. Roughly half of female HIV cases were infected by sexual activity with a man, and injection drug use (IDU) accounted for 18% of female cases. Recently, new diagnoses have increased relatively among younger age groups. During 2008 -2012, rates of new diagnoses among males aged 20 -24 years remained elevated (22.4 per 100,000) compared to the diagnosis rate prior to 2005 (13.1 per 100,000). Relative increases among younger people might reflect an increased rate of new infections among younger people or earlier diagnosis. Blacks/Afric an Americans and Hispanics continue to be more likely than whites to become infected. During 2008 -2012, diagnosis rates were 3.8 times as high among blacks/African Americans and 1.6 times as high among Hispanics compared to whites. From 1981 through the e nd of 2012, 9,307 Oregon residents diagnosed with HIV infection were reported to the Oregon Public Health Division. Forty percent had died by the end of 2012, leaving 5,581 people living with HIV/ AIDS (PLWH/A). As of 2012, Multnomah County was home to 19% of the state's population, but 55% of PLWH/A were diagnosed in Multnomah County. People diagnosed in the Portland metropolitan area and living by the end of 2012 were more likely to be male and MSM than PLWH/A in the remainder of the state, where female c ases and infection from IDU \u2014 although still a distinct minority \u2014 were slightly more common. Other counties that were home to 50 or more PLWH/A at the time of their diagnosis included Clackamas, Deschutes, Douglas, Jackson, Josephine, Lane, Linn, Marion, Yamhill and Washington. Many of these people have moved to other counties since diagnosis, some having been diagnosed more than two decades ago. Consequently, county of residence at diagnosis can be an inaccurate way to estimate the number of current resid ents with HIV/AIDS by county. As of December 31, 2012: 9,307 Oregonians were diagnosed with HIV. 3,726 Oregonians with HIV have died. 5,581 Oregonians were living with HIV. During the last 15 years, approximately 274 Oregonians were diagnosed with HIV each year. 218 Over the past decade, an average of 84 persons with HIV died each year. Diagnosis rates for HIV have increased among 20 -24 year olds since 2006. Fifty -five percent of people living with HIV in Oregon resided in Multnomah County when t hey were diagnosed. Half (641/1,271) of those diagnosed with HIV during 2008 -2012 were Multnomah County residents. Statewide, men were about seven times (12.1 vs. 1.6 per 100,000) more likely than women to be diagnosed with HIV. The average age at diag nosis was 37.7 for males and 36.5 for females (Figure 2). New diagnosis rates were 3.8 times higher among blacks and African Americans than whites (22.1 vs. 5.8 per 100,000).* The rate of new diagnoses for Hispanics was 1.6 times higher than for white non -Hispanics (9.6 vs. 5.8 per 100,000); other races/ethnicities accounted for roughly 4% of all diagnoses. 219 During 2008 -2012, 48% (48/92) of black and African American men with recently diagnosed infection acknowledged having had sex with other men. But , black and African American men with recently diagnosed HIV infection were proportionally less likely than white men to report sex with other men. Relatively few men in either racial group were assigned to the \"presumed heterosexual\" category (Table 1). Twenty -six black and African American women were diagnosed with HIV during 2008 -2012, with high -risk heterosexual exposure , the most common transmission category (Table 1). Only one African American woman (4% of 26) acknowledged injection drug use alone am ong the possible transmission categories (vs. 19/92= 21% of white women and 4/20= 20% of Hispanic women). Eight (31% of 26) of the African American women were assigned to the \"presumed 220 heterosexual female\" category, a slightly higher proportion than the 23 (25% of 92) white women. HIV and mortality facts at a glance: During 2012, the annual number of deaths among people with HIV declined (from 338 deaths during 1994 to 75 cases during 2012). Overall cumulative probability of surviving 10 years after diagnosis was 88% among Oregonians newly diagnosed with HIV infection during 2003 -2012. Cumulative probability of surviving 10 years after diagnosis is highest among blacks/African Americans (97%) relative to all other races. Cumulative probability of surviving 10 years after diagnosis was lower for: \u00bb American Indians or Alaska Natives relative to white non -Hispanics; \u00bb People aged >36 years at diagnosis relative to younger age groups; \u00bb People with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm3 at diagnosis relative to th ose with higher CD4 counts at diagnosis; \u00bb People who acquired HIV via injection drug use (IDU) relative to survival among people with other modes of transmission. During 2008 -2012, HIV disease remained the leading underlying cause of death (48%) among people with HIV who died. Cancer (16% of deaths) was the second most common underlying cause listed. 221 HIV diagnoses by county of residence at diagnosis, Oregon, 1981 -2012 Epidemiologic resources: Oregon Health Authority, HIV/AIDS Disease Control and Prevention: www.cdc.gov/hiv Source of above chart: HIV Data and Analysis The following HIV/AIDS data tables and summaries were prepared by the HIV/STD/TB Program of the Oreg on Health Authority.

The viruses are called herpes simplex type 1 and herpes sim plex type 2. Genital herpes is common in the United States. In the United States, about one out of every six people aged 14 to 49 years have genital herpes. You can get herpes by having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has the disease. Fluids fo und in a herpes sore carry the virus, and contact with those fluids can cause infection. You can also get herpes from an infected sex partner who does not have a visible sore or who may not know he or she is infected because the virus can be released throu gh your skin and spread the infection to your sex partner(s).

Along with a growing awareness of the importance o f social determinants of health and the non -traditional policies needed to achieve better health for all, we continue to recognize that individual health -related choices also play a role in determining health outcomes.\" Quotes from \"Social Determinants of Health in Multnomah County\" Executive Summary December 2010 Multnomah County Health Department, Health Assessment and Evaluation There are many influences on how a family or individual makes their nutritional choices. They can be affected by financial res ources, availability of transportation, education levels, and location of affordable sources of food. These same influences, along with social conditions, can determine other lifestyle choices such as regular exercise. The Multnomah County Health Depart ment's report \"Transportation and Health\" discusses how the transportation planning affects a person's health through the availability of clean air to breath, opportunity for physical activity and employment, and the access to healthcare. 75% of the commut ers in Multnomah County drive to work as compared to 86% nationally. 19% of the residents used active transportation to work (10% nationally). Active transportation includes walking, bicycling, and public transportation. The motor vehicle -related mortalit y rate is the same as the national rate (15.2 per 100,000 population). The county compared well to other cities in walking ability and biking. It also compared well in per capita carbon footprint from transportation and residential energy use. This use dec reased between the years 2000 and 2005. The \"Transportation and Health\" report also discusses the effect of vehicle emissions on people's health. It states that the top three hazardous air pollutants with adverse health effects and cancer risk in the Port land area are diesel, benzene, and formaldehyde. The higher concentrations and elevated cancer risks align with major traffic corridors. Another adverse health risk caused in part by transportation is noise exposure. This includes noise from road traffic, rail traffic, and air traffic. 229 Section on next page is from: http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topicsobjectives2020/overview.aspx?topicid=39 Examples of social determinants include: Availability of resources to meet daily needs (e.g., safe housing and local food markets) Access to educational, economic, and job opportunities Access to health care services Quality of education and job training Availability of community -based resources in support of community living and opportunities for recreational and leisure -time activities Transportation options Public safety Social support Social norms and attitudes (e.g., discrimination, racism, and distrust of government) Exposure to crime, violence, and social disorder (e.g., presence of trash and lack of coo peration in a community) Socioeconomic conditions (e.g., concentrated poverty and the stressful conditions that accompany it) Residential segregation Language/Literacy Access to mass media and emerging technologies (e.g., cell phones, the Internet, and soc ial media) Culture Examples of physical determinants include: Natural environment, such as green space (e.g., trees and grass) or weather (e.g., climate change) Built environment, such as buildings, sidewalks, bike lanes, and roads Worksites, schools, and recreational settings Housing and community design Exposure to toxic substances and other physical hazards 230 Physical barriers, especially for people with disabilities Aesthetic elements (e.g., good lighting, trees, and benches) Poverty Poverty rates a re important indicators of community well -being and are used by government agencies and organizations to allocate need -based resources. The following is from: Income and Poverty in the United States: 2014 Current Population Reports U.S. Department of Commerce Economics and Statistics Administration U.S. CENSUS BUREAU census.gov Household Income Median household income was $53,657 in 2014, not statistically different from the 2013 median in real terms, 6.5 percent lower than the 2007 (the year before the most recent recession) median ($57,357), and 7.2 percent lower than the median household income peak ($57,843) that occurred in 1999. 231 For family households, married -couple households had the highest median income in 2014 ($81,025 ), followed by households maintained by men with no wife present ($53,684). Those maintained by women with no hus band present had the lowest median ($36,151). 232 233 Community Commons.org According to The Oregon Center for Public Policy: In 2014, 16.6 percent of Oregonians - 1 in every 6 people - lived below the federal poverty level. Though down from its 2011 peak of 17.5 percent, the poverty rate in 2014 remained higher than during the period of the Great Recession. About 110,000 more Oregonians were poor in 2014 than in 2009 at the end of the Great Recession. More than one in five children in Oregon live in a household without the resources needed to grow up happy and healthy. In 2014, 21.1 percent of Oregon children lived in po verty.

All rights reserved. http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/oregon/2016/rankings/multnomah/county/outcomes/overall/snapshot How does Multnomah County compare to the United States? Multnomah County child poverty prevalence is higher for all communities of color than nationally, based on data from 2006 -2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). The local prevalence for Black/African Ameri cans is 50.5% compared to 35.4% nationally. The local prevalence for Asian/Pacific Islanders is 18.0% compared to 12.2% nationally. The local prevalence for American Indian/Alaska Natives is 37.5% compared to 33.7% nationally. And the local prevalence for Latinos is 35.2% compared to 29.2% nationally. The prevalence of poverty among non -Latino White children is higher locally (13.2%) than nationally (11.3%). 2014 Report Card on Racial and Ethnic Disparities December 2014 Multnomah County Health Department 239 Federal and state safety net programs lift an estimated 640,000 Oregonians above the poverty line each year, reducing the poverty rate from 29.2 percent (before counting government benefits and taxes) to 12.5 percent. Many are children: the safety net lif ts roughly 160,000 Oregon children above the poverty line, reducing the child poverty rate from 29.1 percent to 10.9 percent. Impact of Largest Programs Social Security lifts more Oregonians above the poverty line each year than any other program. \"Mea ns-tested programs,\" which tie eligibility to a person's income \u2014 such as SNAP (formerly food stamps) and the Earned Income Tax Credit \u2014 also reduce poverty considerably, especially among the non -elderly. In Oregon: Social Security lifts an estimated 370, 000 people \u2014 most of them elderly \u2014 above the poverty line and cuts the elderly poverty rate from 54.7 percent to 11.4 percent. SNAP lifts an estimated 120,000 people above the poverty line, and it makes many others less poor. Altogether, SNAP assists an average of 780,000 people a month, including about 270,000 children. Two working family tax credits, the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit, lift an estimated 130,000 people out of poverty. Altogether, roughly 880,000 people \u2014 including 490,000 children \u2014 receive the Earned Income Tax Credit or low -income part of the Child Tax Credit. Supplemental Security Income, which provides critical aid to elderly and severely disabled people with very low incomes, lifts an estimated 38,000 people above th e poverty line. Housing assistance lifts an estimated 43,000 people above the poverty line. In total, federal rental assistance helps 110,000 people keep a roof over their heads; many other families eligible for assistance don't receive it due to funding limitations. Safety net programs not only reduce immediate deprivation but also have long -term benefits for children, a growing body of research indicates. The findings suggest, for instance, that SNAP and the Earned Income Tax Credit help reduce infant m ortality and low birthweight, and improve children's reading and math test scores, high school completion, college entry, and expected future earnings. The findings also indicate that housing assistance that helps low - income families move to safe, low -pove rty neighborhoods with better schools can enhance their children's long -term prospects.

Since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2008, food box distribution has increase d 41 percent . The OFB Network of regional food banks now distributes about 350,000 more food boxes annually than it did before the recession. 270,000 people per month ate meals from emergency food boxes. A typical emergency food box provides a three - to five-day supply of groceries. Most food pantries serve a specific geographic area and limit the number of times a family can receive help. On average, families access emergency food boxes four times per year. In an average month, 92,000 children eat meal s from emergency food boxes. 3.9-million emergency meals were served at soup kitchens and shelters. And more than 105,000 people received food through other programs in the OFB Network. Long -term unemployment is forcing more people to seek emergency foo d. 27 percent of respondents said long -term unemployment was a major reason they sought emergency food. That compares to 22 percent in 2008 at the beginning of the recession. Most adult emergency food recipients are looking for work, working, retired or disabled. 34 percent of those receiving emergency food are children.

Smith, and Alisha Coleman -Jensen Economic Information Bulletin No. (EIB -153) 42 pp, May 2016 In 2014, 14.0 percent of all U.S. households were food -insecure and 5.6 percent suffered very low food security. Food insecurity was about twice as prevalent among Hispanic households (22.4 percent) as among non -Hispanic White households (10.5 percent) but less prevalent than among non -Hispanic Black households (26.1 percent). The prevalence of very low food secu rity\u2014when the food intake of some household members is reduced and normal eating patterns disrupted at times during the year due to limited resources \u2014followed a similar pattern: 6.9 percent for Hispanic househ olds versus 4.5 percent for White households and 10.4 percent for Black households. Trends in food insecurity from 2000 to 2014 among Hispanic households appear to be closely related to trends in the U.S. labor market. Food insecurity for U.S. Hispanic adults living in food -insecure households during 2011 - 2014 differs by Hispanic origin, immigration status, household composition, and metropolitan status, but differs little by State of residence. Food insecurity was less prevalent among Hispanic adults i dentifying themselves as origi nating from Cuba (12.1 percent) versus those from Mexico, Central and South America, or Puerto Rico (20.8, 20.7, and 25.3 percent, respectively). Food insecurity was less prevalent among Hispanic adults who are U.S. citizens (18.9 percent) than among noncitizens (24.4 percent). The food insecurity of Hispanic adults declined with the length of time they lived in the United States. This reflects th e higher naturalization rate of those who have lived in the United States longer. The prevalence of food insecurity was higher for Hispanic adults living in households headed by single women with children (30.7 percent) and with incomes below the Federal poverty line (37.3 percent) than for all Hispanic adults (20.6 percent). Prevalence rates were lower for Hispanic adults living in households with no children (18.1 percent), households with elderly members (18.1 percent), and households with incomes above 185 percent of the Federal poverty line (9.4 percent). Food insecurity was more prevalent among Hispanic adults living in households in principal cities (21.3 percent) than for those in suburban and other outlying parts of metropolitan areas (18.8 percen t). The prevalence of food insecurity among Hispanic adults differs little across States and groups of States. 248 249 Household Food Security in the United States in 2014, ERR -194 Economic Research Service/USDA Whom Does SNAP Reach? In Fiscal Year 2015, it reached: 780,000 Oregon residents, or 19% of the state population (1 in 5) 45,767,000 participants in the United States, or 14% of the total population (1 in 7) 250 Many Oregon households struggle to put food on the table. The most recent data show: 16.1% of households were \"food insecure,\" or struggled to afford a nutritionally adequate diet. Median income was 8.2% below the 2007 level, after adjusting for inflation. 16.6% of the population lived below the poverty line. 21.1% of children lived below the poverty line. 8.8% of elderly lived below the poverty line. SNAP reaches needy populations: 100% of eligible individuals participated in SNAP in Oregon in 2013, and 100% of eligible workers participated. SNAP kept 119,000 people out of poverty in Oregon, including 54,000 children, per year between 2009 and 2012, on average. (These figures adjust for households' underreporting of benefits ) \"This material was created by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (www.cbpp.org) .\" 251 Food Access \"Healthy food retailers \u2014grocery stores; farmers' markets; cooperatives; mobile markets; and other vendors of fresh, affordable, nutritious food \u2014are critical components of healthy, thriving communities. As the country inches its way out of the Great Recession and seeks to grow a more sustainable and equitable economy, ensuring that healthy food is accessible to all is crucial. Without access to healthy foods, a nutritious diet and go od health are out of reach. And without grocery stores and other fresh food retailers, communities are also missing the commercial vitality that makes neighborhoods livable and helps local economies thrive. Moreover, the challenge of access to healthy foo d has been a persistent one for communities of color. Beginning in the 1960s and 1970s, white, middle -class and working -class families left urban centers for homes in the suburbs, and supermarket chains went with them, leaving many innercity neighborhoods with few or no full -service markets \u2014often for decades. Limited access to healthy food also plagues many rural communities and small towns, where population losses and economic changes have diminished food retail options. Even in agricultural centers where fruits and vegetables are being grown, residents may not have a retail outlet nearby. Many of the communities that lack healthy food retailers are also oversaturated with fast -food restaurants, liquor stores, and other sources of inexpensive, processed foo d with little to no nutritional value. For decades, community activists have organized around the lack of access to healthy foods as an economic, health, and social justice issue.\" Accessing healthy food is a challenge for many families, particularly thos e living in low income neighborhoods, communities of color, and rural areas. Predominantly African American neighborhoods and low -income neighborhoods had the smallest increase in food store availability and the greatest reduction in the number of available grocery stores. Lack of transportation to grocery stores presents a serious problem for many people. About 2.1 million households do not own a vehicle and live more than one mile from the nearest supermarket. While this figure has been improving (down from 2.4 million households in 2006), the lowest vehicle ownership occurs among low -income people, further exacerbating the challenges to accessing healthy food in low -income communities. Convenience stores located in close proximity to middle and high schools represent an important \u2014yet predominantly unhealthy \u2014 source of food for youth, and can have a substantial impact on diets regardless of the quality of food provided in schools. Living closer to healthy food retail is associated with better eat ing habits and decreased risk for obesity and diet -related diseases. 252 Access to Healthy Food and Why It Matters - Policy Link and The Food Trust http://www.policylink.org/sites/default/files/GROCERYGAP_FINAL_NOV2013.pdf Low-income census tracks where a significant number or share of the residents are more 1 mile (urban) or more than 10 miles (rural) form a supermarket. USDA ERS - Go to the Atlas Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Experts Weigh in on SNAP Problems and Solutions \"A recent study by members of the SNAP to Health Project Team was published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (JAND ). Experts from advocacy, government, industry and research organizations were interviewed about the challenges SNAP participa nts face eating nutritiously with SNAP benefits. Respondents also gave their opinions about improvements that could be made to the program to help overcome these challenges. After interviewing the experts, several key barriers to eating nutritiously with SNAP benefits emerged. These included the high cost of nutrient -rich foods, inadequate SNAP benefit amounts, as well as environmental factors associated with poverty. Unfortunately, foods with greater nutritional value tend to be more expensive. Combined with the fact that many experts agreed recipients are not receiving a sufficient amount of benefits, it's easy to see why \"SNAP participants might purchase nutrient -poor foods and beverages instead of purchasing fruits and 253 vegetables to stretch their budg et.\" Taking into consideration environmental factors associated with poverty like poor access to transportation, few local retailers that carry produce and healthy foods, and neighborhood violence that can make walking to retailers unsafe, it is evident t hat there are many barriers for SNAP recipients who want to eat nutritiously.\" SNAP store, food prices, and obesity in urban food deserts. Ghosh -Dastidar B1, Cohe n D2, Hunter G3, Zenk SN4, Huang C5, Beckman R2, Dubowitz T3. Background Lack of access to healthy foods may explain why residents of low -income neighborhoods and African Americans in the U.S. have high rates of obesity. The findings on where people shop and how that may influence health are mixed. However, multiple policy initiatives are underway to increase access in communities that currently lack healthy options. Few studies have simultaneously measured obesity, distance, and prices of the store used for primary food shopping. Purpose To examine the relationship among distance to store, food prices, and obesity. Methods The Pittsburgh Hill/Homewood Research on Eating, Shopping, and Health study c onducted baseline interviews with 1,372 households between May and December 2011 in two low - income, majority African American neighborhoods without a supermarket. Audits of 16 stores where participants reported doing their major food shopping were conducte d. Data were analyzed between February 2012 and February 2013. Results Distance to store and prices were positively associated with obesity ( p<0.05). When distance to store and food prices were jointly modeled, only prices remained significant ( p<0.01), wi th higher prices predicting a lower likelihood of obesity. Although low - and high -price stores did not differ in availability, they significantly differed in their display and marketing of junk foods relative to healthy foods. Conclusions Placing supermark ets in food deserts to improve access may not be as important as simultaneously offering better prices for healthy foods relative to junk foods, actively marketing healthy foods, and enabling consumers to resist the influence of junk food marketing Copyrig ht \u00a9 2014 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesit y: 2011 255 Homelessness Key findings from: The 2015 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress NOVEMBER 2015 All Homeless People In January 2015, 564,708 people were homeless on a given ni ght. Most (69 percent) were staying in residential programs for homeless people, and 31 percent were found in unsheltered locations. Nearly one -quarter of all homeless people were children, under the age of 18 (23 percent or 127,787). Nine percent (or 52,973) were betw een the ages of 18 and 24, and 68 percent (or 383,948) were 25 years or older. Homelessness declined by 2 percent (or 11,742 people) between 2014 and 2015 and by 11 percent (or 82,550) since 2007. Homelessness by Household Type In January 2015, 358,422 people experienced homelessness as individuals (64 percent of all homeless people). There were 206,286 homeless people in families with children on a single night in January 2015, accounting for 36 percent of all homeless people. Homelessness among individuals declined by less than 1 percent (or 1,767) between 2014 and 2015, and by 13 percent (or 54,278) between 2007 and 2015. Homelessness among people in families with children declined by 5 percent (or 9,975) between 2014 and 2015, and by 12 percent (or 28,272) between 2007 and 2015. Homelessness among Subpopulations In January 2015, 83,170 individuals and 13,105 people in fa milies with children were chronically homeless. Chronic homelessness among individuals declined by 1 percent (or 819) over the past year, and by 31 percent (or 36,643) between 2007 and 2015. In January 2015, 47,725 veterans were homeless on a single nigh t. Fewer than 10 percent (4,338) were women. Between 2014 and 2015, homelessness among veterans declined by 4 percent (or 1,964). Homelessness among veterans declined by 35 percent (or 25,642) between 2009 and 2015. There were 36,907 unaccompanied youth on a single night in 2015. Most (87 percent or 32,240) were youth between the ages of 18 and 24, and 13 percent (or 4,667) were children under the age of 18. 256 257 On a Single Night in January 2015 358,422 individuals were homeless in the United States, representing 63 percent of all people experiencing homelessness. Fifty -seven percent of homeless individuals (205,616 people) were in emergency shelters, transitional housing programs, or safe havens . Forty -three percent of homeless individuals (152,806 people) were staying in unsheltered locations such as under bridges, in cars, or in abandoned buildings. People experiencing homelessness as individuals were much more likely to be unsheltered than people experiencing homelessness as part of a family with children (10%). Demographic Characteristics Nine of every 10 homeless individuals are over 24 years of age in 2015. Ten percent are between the ages of 18 and 24, and 1 percent are children under 1 8 years of age. This distribution varies little by shelter status. Most homeless individuals are men (72% or 257,061 people). Women make up a much smaller portion of the homeless individual population (28%) than the proportion of all homeless people (40% ). About 17 percent of homeless individuals are Hispanic or Latino. A somewhat higher percentage of unsheltered individuals are Hispanic or Latino (20%) compared to sheltered individuals (14%). Most homeless individuals are either white (54%) or African American (36%). Compared to all homeless individuals, a higher percentage of African Americans are in the sheltered homeless population (41%), while a higher percentage of whites are in the unsheltered individual homeless population (57%). Between 2014 and 2015, homelessness among individuals increased in 19 states. The largest increases were in New York (3,492 more people), California (2,391), Oregon (1,473), Washington (1,136), and Illinois (802). 258 States with the greatest reductions in the number of homeless people in families with children between 2007 and 2015 were: Texas (6,069 fewer homeless people in families with children), Florida (5,454), California (5,452), New Jersey (4,433), and Oregon (3 ,954). In percentage terms, the largest decline was in Kentucky (67%). 259 EXHIBIT 3.11: CoCs with the Highest and Lowest Rates of Unsheltered Homeless People in Families with Children By CoC Category, 2015 Oregon BoS had the largest number of unaccompanied youth in its category, with 751 unaccompanied people under the age of 25. 260 261 Uncompensated Care YearOregon Hospitals Uncompensated Care Charity Care Bad Debt Total Uncompensated Care YearPortland Metro Hospitals Uncompensated Care Charity Care Bad Debt Total Uncompensated Care262 Data from Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems - 5,000,000 10,000,000 15,000,000 20,000,000 25,000,000 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014Adventist Health Charity Care and Medicaid Shortfalls Medicaid Charity Care 2013 2014State Wide Charity Care and Medicaid Shortfalls Medicaid Charity Care Total263 Hospitalization Costs Health Care Expenditures per Capita by State of Residence | The Henry J.

We tend to focus on averages when discussing health spending, but individuals' health status - and thus their need to access and utilize health services - varies from year to year and over the course of their lifetimes. In fact, very few people have spending around the average. Our updated chart collection explores the variation in health spending across the population through an analysis of the 2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data. We show that just 1% of the p opulation - those with the highest spending \u2014 accounted for 21% of health spending and that just 5% of the population was responsible for almost half of all spending. On the other side of the spectrum, the lowest spending half of the U.S. population accoun ted for just 3% of total health spending in 2013. Out -of-pocket spending was about as concentrated as overall spending, with 1% of the population accounting for one fifth of total out -of-pocket health spending. 266 267 HOW HEALTH SPENDING PATTERNS VARY BY DEMOGRAPHICS IN T HE U.S. ABOVE INFORM ATION IS FROM: PETERSON -KAISER HEALTH SYSTEM TRACKER MEASURING THE PERFOR MANCE OF THE U.S. HE ALTH SYSTEM 268 Most expensive conditions treated in U.S. hospitals, 2013 Table 1 presents the most expensive conditions treat ed in U.S. hospitals among all payers in 2013.

Septicemia was the most expensive condition treated, accounting for $23.7 billion, or 6.2 percent of the aggregate costs for all hospitalizations. Other high -cost hospitalizations were for osteoarthritis ($16.5 billion, or 4.3 percent), liveborn (newborn) infants ($13.3 billion, or 3.5 percent), complication of device , implant or graft ($12.4 billion, or 3.3 percent), and acute myocardial infarction ($12.1 billion, or 3.2 percent). Hospital stays with principal diagnoses of complications of device, implant or graft and complications of surgical procedures or medical care accounted for 5 percent of aggregate hospital costs. 270 The 20 most expensive conditions accounted for 43.7 percent of all hospital stays. Liveborn infants accounted for 10.6 percent of all hospital stays. Septicemia was the second most common reason for hospitalization, accounting for 3.6 percent of stays, followed by osteoarthritis (2.9 percent), pneumonia (2.7 percent), congestive heart failure (2.5 percent), and mood disorders (2.3 percent). In 2013, Medicare accounted for the largest proportion o f aggregate hospital costs (46 percent). Patients with primary Medicare coverage accounted for 46 percent of the $381.4 billion in aggregate hospital costs in 2013. Private insurance was the second most common payer, accounting for 28 percent of total co sts, followed by Medicaid with 17 percent of costs. Stays of uninsured patients represented 5 percent of total hospital costs. Government payers (Medicare and Medicaid) accounted for 63 percent of all hospital costs. Patients covered by Medicare accounte d for a larger proportion of aggregate hospital costs (46 percent) than of hospital stays (39 percent). In contrast, patients covered by Medicaid accounted for only 17 percent of hospital costs but 21 percent of hospital stays. Torio C (AHRQ), Moore B (Tru ven Health Analytics).

Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Black/African Americans experienced the greatest number of disparities with the highest level of concern relative to other communities of color. Statistically significant disparities for 9 of the 18 health indicators for African Americans. Asian/Pacific Islanders experienced fewer health disparities than other racial/ethnic groups in Multnomah County . For 11 indica tors, Asian/Pacific Islanders, did significantly bet ter than non - Latino Whites. Native Americans have statistically significant disparities in 5 of the 18 health indicators for Native Americans and 12 at the needs improvement level . However, for seven of the other health indicators, Native Americans did not have a sufficient number of events to calculate a rate. Hispanics have statistically significant disparities in 6 of the 18 health indicators. There were also eight indicators where Latinos fared significantly better than non -Latino Whites. Leading Causes of Death Chronic diseases and conditions \u2014such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and arthritis \u2014are among the most common, costly, and preventable of all health problems. Nationally -Accidents moved up to 4th, Influenza and pneumonia moved up one, Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis (kidney disease) and stroke moved down one. Oregon - Suicide moved up one on the list. Multnomah County - Order remained the same from 2011. Clackamas County - Order remained the same from 2011. 272 Diabetes Diabetes is b ecoming more common in the United States. From 1980 through 2014, the number of Americans with diagnosed diabetes has increased fourfold (from 5.5 million to 22.0 million). Diabetes and obesity have more than doubled among Oregon adults since 1990. In 2014, diabetes was the 7th leading cause of death in both Multnomah and Clackamas Counties. Obesity Obesity is the number two cause of preventable death in Oregon and nationally, second only to tobacco use. Obesity prevalence among Oregon adults has ris en dramatically in the past two decades, from 11.2% in 1990 to 26.8% in 2013. (27.9% in 2014) . The obesity rate for the state of Oregon was 25.9%. Multnomah County was 21.4%, Clackamas count was 25.2%. Heart Disease and Stroke During 2014, heart diseas e was the second leading cause of death in Oregon. Accounting for 5.3% of all deaths, cerebrovascular disease was the fourth leading cause of mortality among Oregonians. The cerebrovascular disease death rate has long been higher in Oregon than in the United States as a whole. Fourth leading cause of death for Oregon as well as in Multnomah and Clackamas Counties. It is the fifth leading cause of death for men It is the third leading cause of death for women During 2011 -2014, approximately 12% of adults had high total cholesterol and nearly 19% had low HDL cholesterol. 273 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease In 2014, COPD was the third leading cause of death in the U.S. and Oregon. More than 50% of adults with low pulmonary function were not aware that they had COPD. In 2013, 6.7 of Oregonians said they have been told they have COPD. Asthma 10.8% of adults and 7.8% of children in Oregon had asthma in 2011. Adults ages 18 to 24 are more likely to have asthma than older adults are. Women are more likely to have asthma than men are. In children, boys are more likely to have asthma than girls are. Allergies Allergies are the 6th leading cause of chronic illness in the U.S. with an annual cost in excess of $18 billion. The most common allergic diseases include: hay fever, asthma, conjunctivitis, hives, eczema, dermatitis and sinusitis. Allergic conditions are among the most common medical conditions affecting children in the United States Cancer Up to one -third of cancer cases in the United Sta tes are related to excess weight or obesity, physical inactivity, and/or poor nutrition, and thus could be prevented. The incidence of some cancers, including kidney, thyroid, pancreas, liver, uterus, melanoma of the skin, myeloma (cancer of plasma cells), and non -Hodgkin lymphoma, is rising. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in both men and women in the United States. Fiveyear survival rates are low compared to other common cancers at 16.8 percent. 274 Breast cancer is the most common cance r among American women, except for skin cancers . Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women. (Only lung cancer kills more women each year.) Mental Health In 2014, there were an estimated 43.6 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States with AMI in the past year. This number represented 18.1% of all U.S. adults. While mental disorders are common in the United States, their burden of illness is particul arly concentrated among those who experience disability due to serious mental illness (SMI). Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. \u201443.8 million, or 18.5% \u2014experiences mental illness in a given year. Among the 20.2 million adults in the U.S. who experience d a substance use disorder, 50.5% \u2014 10.2 million adults \u2014had a co -occurring mental illness. Alzheimer's disease is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and is the fifth leading cause among people aged 65 years and over. In 2013, suicide was t he second leading cause of death among persons aged 15 -24 years, the second among persons aged 25 -34 years, the fourth among person aged 35 -54 years, the eighth among persons aged 55 -64 years, the seventeenth among persons 65 years and older, and the tenth leading cause of death across all ages. Tobacco Nationally, nearly 1 in 5 adults (or 45.7 million adults) have some form of mental illness, and 36% of these people smoke cigarettes. People with mental health disorders are more likely than people without mental health disorders to experience an alcohol or substance use disorder. Illicit Drug Use The higher percentage of people who were current illicit drug users in 2014 than in prior years appears to reflect trends in marijuana use. Nonmedical pain relieve r use continued to be the second most common type of illicit drug. 275 The estimated 27.0 million people aged 12 or older who were current illicit drug users in 2014 represent 10.2 percent of the population aged 12 or older. In 2009 -2010, Oregon was one of the top ten states for rates of drug -use in several categories. Multnomah County, 2004 -2014 - Deaths from opiate overdose occurred more than twice a week in 2014 (109 deaths). Prescription opiate deaths have not decreased. In 2014, half of all fatal overdoses were associated with prescription opiates . Opiates are the most rapidly growing reason for substance misuse treatment in Multnomah County and in Oregon. By 2013, the number of individuals receiving treatment had increased by more than 107% compared with 20 04. Mortality among HCV -infected persons \u2014primarily adults aged 55 -64 years \u2014is increasing. For the first time in the United States, in 2007 the number of HCV -related deaths (n=15,106) exceeded the number -related deaths (n=12,734) and has since c ontinued to increase. From 2010 -2014, there was an approximate 2.6 -fold increase in the number of reported acute hepatitis C cases from 850 to 2,194 cases, respectively Thirteen states (Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Je rsey, New York State, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia) accounted for 76.4% of the past/present hepatitis C case -reports submitted through NNDSS in 2014. The overall hepatitis C -related mortality rate increased from 4.7 deaths/100,00 0 population in 2010 to 5.0 deaths/100,000 population in 2014. Sexually Transmitted Disease The 2014 data also show that youth are still at the highest risk of acquiring an STD, especially chlamydia and gonorrhea. Despite being a relatively small portion of the sexually active population, young people between the ages of 15 and 24 accounted for the highest rates of chlamydia and gonorrhea in 2014 and almost two thirds of all reported cases. Additionally, previous estimates suggest that young people in this age group acquire half of the estimated 20 million new STDs diagnosed each year. Chlamydia is the most common reportable illness in Oregon. More than 13,000 cases occurred in 2012. 276 Oregon's rate of early syphilis infections greatly increased during the la st eight years. There were 0.7 cases per 100,000 people in 2007 and 10.5 cases per 100,000 people in 2014. This represents a 1500% increase. Increases continue during 2015. Trend data show rates of syphilis are increasing at an alarming rate (15.1 percent in 2014). While rates have increased among both men and women, men account for more than 90 percent of all primary and secondary syphilis cases. Half (641/1,271) of those diagnosed with HIV during 2008 -2012 were Multnomah County residents. During 2012, th e annual number of deaths among people with HIV declined (from 338 deaths during 1994 to 75 cases during 2012). Social Determinants of Health In 2014, 16.6 percent of Oregonians - 1 in every 6 people - lived below the federal poverty level. About 110,000 more Oregonians were poor in 2014 than in 2009 at the end of the Great Recession. In 2014, 21.1 percent of Oregon children lived in poverty. Multnomah County child poverty prevalence is higher for all communities of color than nationally. For the fourt h year in a row, the OFB statewide network of regional food banks distributed more than 1 million emergency food boxes. Since the beginning of the Great Recession in 2008, food box distribution has increased 41 percent . In an average month, 92,000 children eat meals from emergency food boxes . Many Oregon households struggle to put food on the table. The most recent data show: 16.1% of households were \"food insecure,\" or struggled to afford a nutritionally adequate diet. Median income was 8. 2% below the 2007 level, after adjusting for inflation. 16.6% of the population lived below the poverty line. 21.1% of children lived below the poverty line. 8.8% of elderly lived below the poverty line. 277 Predominantly African American neighborhoods and low-income neighborhoods had the smallest increase in food store availability and the greatest reduction in the number of available grocery stores. Between 2014 and 2015, homelessness among individuals increased in 19 states. The largest increases were in New York (3,492 more people), California (2,391), Oregon (1,473), Washington (1,136), and Illinois (802). States with the greatest reductions in the number of homeless people in families with children between 2007 and 2015 were: Texas (6,069 fewer homeless people in families with children), Florida (5,454), California (5,452), New Jersey (4,433), and Oregon (3 ,954). In percentage terms, the largest decline was in Kentucky (67%). Survey Conclusions A review of the results of the two surveys shows similar concerns among the both. Those concerns are as follows: Behavior/Mental Health Access to Affordable Heal th Care Life Style Concerns surrounding: Drug and Alcohol Abuse Health Eating Habits Obesity Lack of Exercise Social Determinates of Health Housing Homelessness 278 Appendix A Healthy Columbia Willamette Collaborate Survey Portland Adventist Medical Center Demographics of survey respondents living within service center of Portland Adventist Medical Center Results shown by language in which survey was taken Age English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 829 Under 18 9 0 0 0 0 9 1.1% 19-25 64 0 0 0 0 64 7.7% 26-39 272 9 0 0 0 281 33.9% 40-54 218 10 1 3 1 233 28.1% 55-64 146 2 0 1 0 149 18.0% 65-79 87 0 0 0 0 87 10.5% 80 and older 6 0 0 0 0 6 0.7% Prefer not to answer 9 1 0 0 0 10 Blank 12 0 0 0 0 12 Total 823 22 1 4 1 851 829 Gender English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 806 Female 503 16 1 3 1 524 65.0% Male 268 5 0 1 0 274 34.0% Gender non -conforming 3 0 0 0 0 3 0.4% Transgender 3 0 0 0 0 3 0.4% Male, Female 1 0 0 0 0 1 0.1% Transgender, Gender non - conforming 1 0 0 0 0 1 0.1% Prefer not to answer 23 0 0 0 0 23 blank 21 1 0 0 0 22 Total 823 22 1 4 1 851 806 0 Total non -normative gender 8 1 0 0 0 9 1.1% Sexual Orientation English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 807 Heterosexual 643 14 1 4 0 662 82.0% Gay or lesbian 46 0 0 0 0 46 5.7% Bisexual 27 1 0 0 0 28 3.5% Queer 8 0 0 0 0 8 1.0% Questioning or unsure 2 0 0 0 0 2 0.2% Another sexual orientation 3 0 0 0 0 3 0.4% 279 Write -in identity or multiple (all are non -normative) 58 0 0 0 0 58 7.2% Write -in with no identity named (can't determine) 25 0 0 0 0 25 Prefer not to answer 7 3 0 0 1 11 Blank 4 4 0 0 0 8 Total 823 22 1 4 1 851 807 Total minority sexual orientations 144 1 0 0 0 145 18.0% Hispanic Ethnicity English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 734 Hispanic 62 22 0 3 0 87 11.9% Non -Hispanic 645 0 1 0 1 647 88.1% Blank 116 0 0 1 0 117 Total 823 22 1 4 1 851 734 Race English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 725 African American/Black 44 0 0 0 0 44 6.1% African 3 0 0 0 0 3 0.4% Arab American/Middle Eastern 1 0 0 0 0 1 0.1% Asian American/Asian 22 0 1 0 1 24 3.3% European American/White/Caucasian 528 0 0 3 0 531 73.2% Native American/American Indian/Alaska Native 26 0 0 0 0 26 3.6% Multiracial 80 4 0 0 0 84 11.6% Other 9 3 0 0 0 12 1.7% Prefer not to answer 54 10 0 1 0 65 Blank 56 5 0 0 0 61 Total 823 22 1 4 1 851 725 Location of Childhood English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 813 Inside the United States 765 5 0 0 0 770 94.7% Outside the United States 22 16 1 3 1 43 5.3% Prefer not to answer 9 0 0 0 0 9 Blank 27 1 0 1 0 29 Total 823 22 1 4 1 851 813 Language English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 825 English 762 1 0 0 0 763 92.5% 280 Spanish or Spanish Creole 15 21 0 0 0 36 4.4% Other than English or Spanish 20 0 1 4 1 26 3.2% Prefer not to answer 6 0 0 0 0 6 Blank 20 0 0 0 0 20 Total 823 22 1 4 1 851 825 Veteran Status English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 806 Veteran 58 0 0 0 0 58 7.2% Not a veteran 721 22 1 3 1 748 92.8% Prefer not to answer 18 0 0 0 0 18 Blank 26 0 0 1 0 27 Total 823 22 1 4 1 851 806 Disability Status English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 809 Has a disability 176 1 0 0 0 177 21.9% Does not have a disability 606 20 1 4 1 632 78.1% Prefer not to answer 25 0 0 0 0 25 Blank 16 1 0 0 0 17 Total 823 22 1 4 1 851 809 Educational Attainment for Ages 25 and Older English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 741 Less than high school 20 7 0 0 0 27 3.6% High school diploma or GED 193 7 0 1 0 201 27.1% AA degree 5 0 0 0 0 5 0.7% Some college 27 1 0 0 0 28 3.8% College degree or higher 471 4 1 3 1 480 64.8% Other (can't determine) 1 0 0 0 0 1 Prefer not answer 16 2 0 0 0 18 Blank 17 1 0 0 0 18 Total 750 22 1 4 1 778 741 Ratio of Income to Poverty Level English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 696 At or below 200% FPL 235 11 0 2 0 248 35.6% Over 200% FPL 442 2 1 2 1 448 64.4% Can't determine 146 9 0 0 0 155 Total 823 22 1 4 1 851 696 Health Insurance English Spanish Vietnamese Russian Chinese Total n = 802 Pay cash (no insurance) 28 8 0 0 0 36 4.5% 281 Private health insurance 452 8 0 3 1 464 57.9% Medicaid 176 3 0 1 0 180 22.4% Medicare 98 0 0 0 0 98 12.2% Veterans' Administration 9 0 0 0 0 9 1.1% Indian Health Services 6 0 0 0 0 6 0.7% Medicare/Medicaid 2 0 0 0 0 2 0.2% Other public 7 0 0 0 0 7 0.9% can't determine 1 0 0 0 0 1 Prefer not to answer 18 2 0 0 0 20 blank 26 1 1 0 0 28 Total 823 22 1 4 1 851 802 Q1: QUALITY OF LIFE: In the following list, what do you think are the five most important characteristics of a \"Healthy Community\"?

This report documents the community health needs of HCWC's four -county region and each of the counties. The community health needs, referred to in this report as priority health issues, were identified through a comprehensive study of population, hospital, Medicaid, and community data. 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment Data Sources Health Status Assessment 1) Population data about health -related behaviors, morbidity, and mortality. 2) Medicai d data from local Coordinated Care Organizations (CCOs) about the most frequent conditions for which individuals on Medicaid sought care in the tri -county region in Oregon (Clark County Medicaid data were not available for this report). 3) Hospital data f or uninsured people who were seen in the emergency department with a condition that should have been managed in primary or ambulatory care. Community Themes and Strengths 1) Online survey about quality of life, issues affecting community health, and ris ky health behaviors. 2) Listening sessions with an array of communities in the four -county region to identify community members' vision for a healthy community, needs in the community, and existing strengths. 3) An inventory of recent community engagemen t projects in the four -county region that assess communities' health needs. Key Findings Regional demographics Approximately 2.2 million people lived in the four -county region in 2014, having increased 15.5% from 2000 to 2010. Although the racial and ethnic population is predominantly White, non -Hispanic/Latino (74.1%), the demographics of the region continue to di versify. The foreign -born population increased 16.0% from 2005 - 2014, while the Hispanic/Latino population increased 69.8% in the region from 2000 to 2010. 294 Social determinants of health and equity Factors such as income, housing, and education impact co mmunities' health in the region. The number of individuals living in poverty in the region ranged from 9.2 -18.8% (depending on the county), while the number of children (18 years or younger) living in poverty ranged from 11.2 -24.1%. Nearly one fifth of households in the region received SNAP (food assistance) benefits in the past 12 months. Housing affordability and high rates of homelessness affected communities across the four -county region. Through listening sessions, an online survey, and an inventory o f recent community engagement projects, HCWC identified upstream factors, such as access to food, health care, transportation, and safe, affordable housing, as important needs in our community. Community members specified culturally and linguistically appr opriate services and support for people with behavioral health challenges as needed improvements to health care and public health systems. Communities across the four -county region also advocated for policies, systems, and environments that support healthy behaviors and identified racism, discrimination, and stigma as problems that contribute to poor health in the region. Health behaviors Population health data from state surveys show that risky health behaviors, such as binge drinking, cigarette smoking , lack of exercise, and not eating enough healthy foods, are prevalent in the region. For teenagers, specifically, the assessment identified alcohol, marijuana, and vaping/e -cigarette use as common behaviors. Access to health care and preventive services w ere identified as priority health issues \u2014specifically lack of a usual source of care among adults and lack of flu shots and pneumonia vaccines for adults 65 and older. Diagnosed health conditions for low -income residents An analysis of Medicaid claims d ata from CCOs in Oregon showed that for youth, asthma, attention deficit disorder, and post -traumatic stress disorder were the most commonly diagnosed chronic conditions. For adults on Medicaid in the tri -county region, depression, diabetes, and hypertensi on were the most common diagnoses. People with Medicaid, whose incomes are below 139% of the Federal Poverty Level, represent nearly 20% of the population in the tri -county Oregon region. Emergency department admissions for uninsured residents Utilizati on data from local hospitals were analyzed for people who were uninsured or \"self -pay,\" and were admitted to the Emergency Department for a condition that could have been treated in a primary care setting. The most common conditions for adults within this population were diabetes, hypertension, and kidney/urinary infections. For youth, the top diagnosed conditions were asthma and severe ear, nose, and throat infections. Morbidity and mortality Epidemiologists from the four county health departments prior itized 104 health indicators using the following criteria: existence of a disparity by race/ethnicity or sex, comparison with the state, trend over time, severity, and magnitude. Data came from a variety of sources, including vital statistics, disease and injury morbidity data, cancer registries, and adult and student surveys. In addition to the health behaviors described above, the following morbidity and mortality indicators rose to the top as orga health issues. 295 Morbidity (Disease)* Asthma Cance r, 9 types (see population data section of full report for specific types) Chlamydia Depression Hypertension High Cholesterol Obesity/overweight *Issues are listed in alphabetical order.
