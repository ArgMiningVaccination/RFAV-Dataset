Border with Mozambique in Mtwara Region - Avoid all travel [Avoid all travel](#levels) to within 10 km of the border with Mozambique, in the Mtwara Region, due to the presence of armed groups, the threat of terrorism and the risk of kidnapping. Portion of Mtwara Region south of the A19 highway - Avoid non-essential travel [Avoid non-essential travel](#levels) to the area between the A19 highway and the border with Mozambique in the Mtwara Region, due to the presence of armed groups, the threat of terrorism and the risk of kidnapping. This advisory excludes the areas within 10 km from the border with Mozambique, where you should avoid all travel. This advisory also excludes Mtwara City where you should exercise a high degree of caution. Border with Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa) - Avoid non-essential travel [Avoid non-essential travel](#levels) to the area within 20 km of the border with Burundi and 20 km from the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika along the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa), due to the presence of armed groups and traffickers, and the threat of kidnappings. This excludes the city of Kigoma and Gombe, Katavi and Mahale national parks. Safety and security Border with Mozambique in the Mtwara region Extremist groups are active in the northern districts of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique. Security incidents have occurred along the border, in the Mtwara Region. Tanzanian military and security forces conduct counterinsurgency operations in the area. Access to the area is controlled in several locations and movements in and out are monitored. Southern Mtwara region Armed groups have been active in the southern Mtwara region between highway 19 and 10 km from the border with Mozambique. There is a threat of terrorism and kidnappings in this region. Border with Burundi and Democratic Republic of Congo (Kinshasa) Travel near refugee camps in northwestern Tanzania, particularly in the region of Kigoma and to the west of Kagera bordering Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, is dangerous due to banditry. Demonstrations Demonstrations may occur, particularly in Zanzibar and occasionally in Dar es Salaam, Arusha, Mwanza, Mbeya, Mtwara, and Stone Town. Demonstrations increase during flare-ups of political tension which can include election periods. Even peaceful demonstrations can turn violent at any time. They can also lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. - Avoid areas where demonstrations and large gatherings are taking place - Follow the instructions of local authorities - Monitor local media for information on ongoing demonstrations [Mass gatherings (large-scale events)](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings) Crime Petty crime Petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, occurs, particularly in public places and popular tourist areas in Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar and Arusha. Exercise caution in and around: - beaches - hotels - restaurants - nightclubs and cinemas - shopping centres In Dar es Salaam, exercise increased caution in and around: - Coco Beach - transportation hubs - markets, particularly Kariakoo Market - Masaki/Oyster Bay Peninsula, particularly along Toure Drive In Zanzibar, exercise increased caution in and around Stone Town. To mitigate the threat from theft: - ensure that your belongings, including your passport and other travel documents, are secure at all times - seek local advice on the security situation prior to visiting beaches - avoid deserted beaches Bag snatching from passing vehicles is very common. - When walking along the street, do not carry your bag with the strap across your body. You could be badly injured if a thief drives by and attempts to steal your bag Violent crime Tourists have been victims of assaults, including sexual assaults, in Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar and Arusha. If you are the victim of an armed robbery, do not resist. Attackers could assault you for failing to comply or not complying quickly enough. - Exercise a high degree of caution - Avoid walking around at night Crimes against children and people with albinism, including murder, have occurred. Be particularly cautious. Organized crime Organized crime associated with international drug trafficking occurs in Tanzania, as it is situated along a transit route used to transport drugs from Asia to Africa. Though tourists are rarely affected, exercise caution in large cities. Kidnappings Kidnapping-for-ransom does not pose significant risk in Tanzania, though armed groups from bordering countries are known to employ this tactic. Exercise caution along border areas, namely: - areas bordering Lake Tanganyika, which marks the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo - the southeastern border with Mozambique Express kidnappings Tourists have been taken to ATMs and forced to withdraw funds from their account after accepting a ride from a stranger, a local taxi, ride share companies or a recent acquaintance. These incidents have most often occurred near hotels and transportation hubs such as ferry, bus and train terminals in Dar es Salaam. To minimize the risk, do not accept unsolicited offers of assistance or rides from new acquaintances or strangers. Always book transportation from a reputable company or through your hotel. Home invasions Armed home robberies occur and foreigners' homes have been targeted by criminals. Always lock your doors and windows and use reinforced barriers wherever possible. Do not rent temporary accommodations from new acquaintances. Be sure to go through a reputable agency if looking for long-term accommodations in Tanzania. Road travel While better in larger centres, road conditions and road safety are poor throughout the country. Road conditions Road signs are often missing, and visibility is poor due to insufficient lighting. Poorly maintained cars, roaming wildlife, livestock, cyclists and pedestrians also increase the risk associated with driving. Outside major cities, four-wheel drive vehicles are highly recommended. - Avoid driving unless you are familiar with local conditions - Avoid travelling by road at night. Due to the potential for assault or robbery when stopped at a light at night, some drivers ignore traffic lights. This practice makes intersections dangerous at night - In the event of an accident, drive to the nearest police station Tourist facilities are adequate in major cities but limited in remote areas, with the exception of principal game lodges and beach resorts. Monitor fuel levels to ensure that your fuel tank is never lower than half full. Road safety Drivers often drive at excessive speeds, and they can be aggressive or reckless. Accident causing fatalities are common. Armed robberies, carjackings and attacks on moving vehicles have occurred in Arusha and Dar es Salaam, particularly on Toure Drive (Msasani Peninsula). - Avoid travelling alone - Keep windows rolled up and doors locked - Avoid travelling after dark - Remain on tourist routes and avoid remote areas - If you find yourself on less-travelled roads and trails, avoid stopping because armed robberies and carjackings may occur - When travelling between cities, you should do so in a convoy, whenever possible Crowds tend to form around accidents and foreigners are extorted for money or assaulted (even when they are not at fault). Terrorism There is a threat of terrorism, particularly in Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar, Arusha and border areas. Terrorist attacks could occur at any time. Targets could include: - government buildings, including schools - places of worship - airports and other transportation hubs and networks - public areas such as tourist attractions, restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping centres, markets, hotels and other sites frequented by foreigners Stay at hotels that have robust security measures. Always be aware of your surroundings when in public places. Fraud Credit card and ATM fraud occurs. Be cautious when using your credit or debit card at ATMs, and: - pay careful attention when your cards are being handled by others - use ATMs located in well-lit public areas or inside a bank or business - avoid using card readers that have an irregular or unusual feature - cover the keypad with one hand when entering your PIN - check for any unauthorized transactions on your account statements Foreigners have been victims of scams relating to volunteer work visas and safaris. If you plan to engage in these activities, only deal with reputable companies and check their references Spiked food and drinks Never leave food or drinks unattended or in the care of strangers. Be wary of accepting snacks, beverages, gum or cigarettes from new acquaintances. These items may contain drugs that could put you at risk of sexual assault and robbery. 2SLGBTQI+ travellers 2SLGBTQI+ persons have been subject to physical and verbal harassment by locals and authorities. 2SLGBTQI+ travellers should carefully consider the risks of travelling to Tanzania. [Travel and your sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression and sex characteristics](https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/lgbt-travel) Corruption Some officials solicit bribes as you go through customs at airports. In a common scheme, an official will ask the visitor to produce a certificate of proof of inoculation against yellow fever, even in cases where you don't need one. If this happens to you, ask to speak to a senior official. Police officers may approach you requesting money for alleged offences. Before proceeding to a police station, insist they produce proper identification. If you think you are dealing with a corrupt official, you may inform them you will contact the High Commission for advice. This tends to dissuade them from soliciting bribes. Report all such incidents to the High Commission of Canada in Dar es Salaam. National parks and nature reserves Organized tours and independent travellers have been victims of armed robbery in parks and nature reserves. Exercise caution in: - the northern circuit in the vicinity of Serengeti National Park - Arusha National Park and Ngorongoro Conservation Area - regions surrounding Mount Kilimanjaro Avoid camping or travelling alone and hire a reputable tour guide. Hotels can make recommendations for reputable tour companies. While camps and lodges are generally guarded, potentially dangerous wild animals often venture within the boundaries of the camp. - Follow the advice and warnings of local tour guides and camp employees - Do not walk around at night - Never leave children unattended Mountaineering If you are considering climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, carefully consider the inherent risks involved. People are seriously injured or killed on the mountain every year, and emergency assistance is severely limited. If you intend to climb: - never do so alone and always hire an experienced guide from a reputable company - buy travel insurance that includes helicopter rescue and medical evacuation - ensure that your physical condition is good enough to meet the challenges of your activity - ensure that you are properly equipped and well informed about weather and other conditions that may pose a hazard - inform a family member or friend of your itinerary, including when you expect to be back to camp - know the symptoms of acute altitude sickness, which can be fatal - obtain detailed information on trekking routes or ski slopes before setting out and do not venture off marked trails Power outages Power outages occur regularly across the country. Local authorities may impose rationing measures for electricity. Power outages could affect your ability to purchase basic necessities and impact essential services, such as: - public transportation - medical services - water supply - telecommunications - banking Not all buildings are equipped with generators. - Plan accordingly - Keep a supply of water, food and fuel on hand - Make sure you always have an emergency kit on hand Public transportation Buses You should avoid travelling by bus (dala dala), as public buses are often overcrowded, poorly maintained and driven in a reckless manner. Public buses are frequently involved in accidents which have resulted in fatalities. There have been reports of sexual assault on buses. Intercity buses are typically more safe and meet higher maintenance standards. Do not travel on overnight buses. Rail Rail service is limited and maintenance standards are low. There have been reports of theft on crowded trains, particularly overnight trains. Taxis A licensed taxi is a white car with a white (never yellow) licence plate, a coloured stripe running laterally on the side panels of the vehicle, a number located inside a circle on the passenger doors and visible insurance and registration numbers located on the windshield. - Don't use motorcycle taxis (pika-pika or boda-boda) or three wheel taxis (bajaj), as drivers are often reckless and do not provide adequate safety equipment for passengers (such as helmets) - Use only licensed taxis selected by a reputable hotel or restaurant, or one located at an official taxi stand - Avoid taking a taxi that has been hailed for you by a recent acquaintance - Always ask for identification before accepting transportation and check that the driver's ID matches the name of the car registration and taxi licence Ferries There are regular ferries travelling between Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar. Tanzanian ports are often frequented by persuasive ticket scalpers. Vessels travelling between the following ports are less reliable and often overcrowded: - Zanzibar and Pemba - Tanga and Pemba - Mafia and mainland Tanzania Ferry accidents occur due to the overloading and poor maintenance of some vessels. - Only use reputable ferry companies - Do not board vessels that appear overloaded or unseaworthy Piracy Pirate attacks and armed robbery against ships occur in coastal waters, particularly in the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean. Mariners should take appropriate precautions.
