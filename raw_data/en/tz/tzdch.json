It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The flu is different from a cold. The flu usually comes on suddenly. People who have the flu often experience fever, chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue (tiredness). Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults. Some people, such as people ages 65+, young children and those with certain health conditions, are at high risk for serious flu complications. The best way to prevent the flu is by getting vaccinated each year with a flu shot. [What is the flu shot?](javascript:void(0)) The \"flu shot\" is a vaccine that protects you from the flu virus. It is inactivated, which means it contains a killed version of the virus which cannot cause disease and is most commonly given as an injection (with a needle) in the arm. This season's vaccine protects against four influenza viruses that research indicates will be most common during the season. This includes an influenza A (H1N1) virus, an influenza A (H3N2) virus and 2 influenza B viruses. The vaccine takes effect approximately two weeks after it has been administered as antibodies (substances in the blood that protect against infection) accumulate and provide protection against influenza. Therefore, it is important to get a flu shot before the flu begins to circulate in your area as you may be susceptible to influenza during the two weeks after your flu shot. The flu shot will not 100% eliminate the risk of getting the flu as there are several strains of viruses that can cause the flu. However, data suggests flu symptoms may be milder and complications can be reduced following vaccination. It can also protect others who are vulnerable but may not be able to receive the vaccine for a variety of reasons.

Walgreens offers flu shots to anyone ages 3+. It's recommended that anyone who wants to reduce their chances of getting the flu should be vaccinated. It's especially important for certain people to get vaccinated, such as those who are at high risk of developing serious complications like pneumonia if they get sick with the flu. This includes: People who have certain medical conditions including asthma, weakened immune systems, diabetes and chronic heart or lung disease Pregnant women People ages 65+ People who live with or care for others who are at high risk for developing serious complications. This includes household contacts and caregivers of people with certain medical conditions including asthma, diabetes, chronic lung disease, and others.

This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients. Certain individuals should not be vaccinated without first consulting a healthcare professional. These patients include: - People who had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (a severe paralyzing illness, also called GBS) within six weeks of getting the flu vaccine previously - People who have a moderate or severe illness with a fever, including those with COVID-19, should wait until they recover before getting a flu shot [Is there a flu shot for ages 65+?](javascript:void(0)) Adults ages 65+ have a higher risk for developing complications from the flu and account for more than 60% of the flu-related hospitalizations each year. Recent studies show that people ages 65+ may not respond as well to standard-dose flu shots because they do not produce as high of an antibody response following vaccination as do younger people. People with low antibody levels may be at higher risk of catching the flu. While adults ages 65+ may receive a standard flu shot, there are vaccines designed specifically for patients ages 65+ that work by improving the production of antibodies in order to provide a stronger immune response to the flu than traditional vaccines. Like the standard flu shot, these vaccines are given as an injection in the arm and the side effects are similar, though some patients may experience increased pain, redness, or swelling around the injection site compared to standard-dose flu vaccines. [When should I get the flu shot?](javascript:void(0)) The CDC recommends that people get the flu shot before the flu is widespread by late fall. The peak flu season is typically October to March in the U.S. but people should receive their vaccine as long as the virus is circulating. People should get their flu shot every flu season to ensure the best protection from the flu for themselves and others. [What are the common side effects of the flu shot?](javascript:void(0)) The viruses in the flu shot are killed (inactivated), so you cannot get the flu from a flu shot. Some minor side effects that could occur are: - Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given - Fever (low grade) - Aches If these side effects occur, they begin soon after the shot and usually last 1 to 2 days. Over the counter products may be recommended to manage minor side effects. Most people who receive influenza vaccine have no serious problems from it.
