The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) was established in the year 2008. 13.1.1 Activities Enforcement/Regulatory Compliance FSS Act, 2006 is being implemented by all State/ UT Governments. State/UT Governments have appointed Commissioners of Food Safety, notified Adjudicating Officers, designated Officers and Food Safety Officers for respective areas to perform functions mandated under the Act. Additional Food Safety Commissioners have been notified for Railways, Airports and Ports along with Designated Offices for Airports and Ports. There is an online process for issuance of licenses to Food Business Operators (FBOs). As on 31st March, 2019, 46,851 Central Licenses have been issued by the Central Licensing Authorities. The States/UTs have granted 10,44,992 States licenses and registered 47,97,997 FBOs. These include 10,66,645 registrations facilitated by Common Service Centres. Four meetings of the Central Advisory Committee were held between 1.1.2018 and 31.3.2019. At present fee for Central License is being received through online mode only. Some States have also adopted online mode for acceptance of fee for State License. However, States/UTs, where payment towards License/Registration fee is still being carried out through the Bank Challan mode are being impressed upon to switch over to digital mode. During 1.1.2018 and 31.3.2019, FSSAI has taken several steps towards simplification and rationalization of licensing & registration processes: FSSAI is undertaking comprehensive review of Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulations, 2011 which shall focus more on raising the bar for food safety compliance instead of just the documentation by means of licensing and registration. FSSAI is working on new software to replace the existing software application Food Licensing and Registration System (FLRS) to further simplify matters for FBOs and to make the system more transparent. FSSAI has completely done away with physical submission of various documents required for licensing/registration under the FSS Act. To avoid postal delays in getting physical signed copy of License /Registration, FSSAI has introduced issuance of system generated 208 CHAPTER-13 ANNUAL REPORT I 2018-19License/Registration to e-mail IDs of FBOs which shall bear a Quick Response (QR) Code as a security feature to verify the License/Registration. States have been asked to monitor the status of expired licenses on a monthly basis. FSSAI has notified Food Safety and Standards (Food Safety Auditing) Regulations, 2018 to lay down procedure for conducting third party food safety audit of FBOs to ascertain adherence to food safety and hygiene requirements laid down in Schedule 4 of Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration of Food Businesses) Regulations, 2011. FSSAI has put in place a web-based 'Food Safety Compliance through Regular Inspections and Sampling (FoSCoRIS) System' to verify compliance of food safety and hygiene standards by food businesses which replaces the manual keeping of Inspection Reports with digital records including the provision of capturing real time data viz. Images of the FBOs' premises, geo-location, date and time etc. of the inspections conducted. Three States viz. Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu have their States. FSSAI has launched \"Clean and Safe Meat\" Initiative on 11th September, 2018 with the objective to develop an ecosystem that will enable the availability of clean and safe meat and meat products to consumers. Third party audit of 40 municipal slaughter houses has already commenced and reports of 16 such slaughter houses have been received. 13.1.2 Standards and Regulations Globally benchmarked food standards FSSAI has constituted a Scientific Committee and 19 Scientific Panels comprising independent scientific experts under Section 14(1) and 13(1) of the FSS Act, 2006 for providing scientific opinion on various issues. During the period, FSSAI has successfully organised several meetings of Scientific Committee and all Scientific Panels in which various scientific opinions and several food standards have been developed. So far, FSSAI has developed over 500 food product standards and reviewed and expanded standards for food additives that now has over 9000 provisos covering 350 additives and food processing aids by harmonizing the standards of food additives with Codex Standards. FSSAI has notified some major Regulations during Jan, 2018 and March, 2019 which include Food Safety and Standards (Alcoholic Beverages) Regulations, 2018, Food Safety and Standards (Food Safety Auditing) Regulations, 2018, Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Foods) Regulations, 2018, Food Safety and Standards (Advertisements and Claims) Regulations, 2018, Food Safety and Standards (Packaging) Regulations, 2018. Tolerance limits of antibiotics and pharmacological active substances have also been prescribed. Out of 32 areas that are listed in the Act, regulations have already been framed and notified in 28 areas. 13.1.3 Quality Assurance Strengthening of Food Testing System in the Country: FSSAI is implementing a Central Sector Scheme for \"Strengthening of Food Testing System in the Country including Provision of Mobile Food Testing Labs\" (SOFTeL) with a total outlay of Rs. 481.95 crores, time frame for implementation of the scheme being 2016-17 to 2018-19. The scheme envisages strengthening of 45 State Food Testing Labs, 12 Referral Laboratories, establishing 62 Mobile Food Labs (called Food Safety on Wheels) and Capacity Building of food testing personnel. Status of implementation during the period 01.01.2018-31.03.2019 is given below- i.

It has also been upgraded with some minor equipment and a few high end equipment. Food Analyst Examination and Junior Analyst Examination (i) FSSAI regularly conducts Food Analyst Examinations (FAE). During the period, 4th and 5th FAEs were conducted in which 73 and 83 candidates, respectively, were declared qualified. Now overall there are 360 qualified food analyst. (ii) FSSAI has also started conducting Junior Analyst Examination (JAE) from 2018. During the period, 1st and 2nd JAEs were conducted in which total 184 candidates were declared as qualified Junior Analyst. National Milk Quality Surveillance (NMQS): The Interim Report of NMQS, 2018 was released on 13.11.2018 and is available on FSSAI website. The survey was conducted through an external vendor (M/s Vimta Labs, Hyderabad). This is by far the largest systematic survey of milk both in terms of sample size (6432 samples) and numbers of parameters (4 quality parameters, 12 adulterants; and 4 contaminants). Samples that failed in the qualitative tests were quantitatively analysed. The result of the survey suggests that the milk in India is largely safe. International Training Centre for Food Safety Analysis and Applied Nutrition (ITC-FSAN): FSSAI in collaboration with EIC and GFSP is establishing an International Training Centre for Food Safety Analysis & Applied Nutrition (ITCFSAN) at Export Inspection Agency's (EIA) Pilot Test House, ITC-FSAN is expected to become the hub for providing training programs to build capacity for the food testing laboratories in our country as well as in the neighbouring countries. The ITC-FSAN is expected to be operationalised shortly.Addressing Micronutrient deficiencies through Food Fortification: FSSAI is addressing micronutrient deficiencies by formulating standards for fortification of key staple viz. edible oil and milk (with Vitamin A & D), wheat flour and rice (with iron, folic acid and vitamin B12) and salt with iron (in addition to iodine) and has notified Food Safety and Standards (Fortification of Foods) Regulations, 2018 on 02.08.2018. It has also launched a logo to identify fortified food. FSSAI set up Food Fortification Resource Centre with support of Tata Trusts to promote food fortification. V oluntary fortification has begun for these staples. Availability of the fortified products in the open market has been steadily increasing. There are 70 Top and MSME brands with over 100 fortified products available in the open market across all commodities. There has been tremendous traction in the oil and milk industry, with over 30 fortified oil brands and 34 milk brands, fortified as per FSSAI standards, available in the market. In spite of a fragmented market structure, a number of wheat flour, rice and salt industry brands have begun fortifying their products. So far, 12 wheat flour brands, 2 rice brands and 12 double fortified salt brands are available in the open market. Fortified staples (wheat flour, oil and DFS) have been introduced in Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and the Mid-Day Meal (MDM) Scheme and PDS Schemes. In order to address rising incidence of Vitamin 'D' Deficiencies (VDD), particularly amongst children, Food Fortification Resource Centre (FFRC) of FSSAI launched a unique initiative, 'Project Dhoop' to highlight importance of Vitamin D through sunlight exposure. 13.1.4 Imports As per Section 25 of the Food Safety & Standards Act, 2006, all imports of articles of food are subject to the provisions of the Act. It stipulates that no person shall import into India any article 211 CHAPTER-13of food in contravention of the Act or any rules and regulations made thereunder. Exercising the power of the Act, the Central Government notified the FSS (Import) Regulations, 2017 on 9th March, 2017. FSSAI has its presence at 21 points of entry under 6 locations namely Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Cochin and Tuticorin and Food Import Clearance System (FICS) of FSSAI is linked to Customs ICE-GATE. Customs Department implements the Risk Management system (RMS), i.e. selective sampling and testing of food articles in consultation with FSSAI. FSSAI has set the parameters for RMS to be applicable on imported food items. RMS is being applied in ICEGATE before sending the consignment/bill of entry (BOE) in FICS. During the period 01.01.2018 - 31.03.2019, out of 73,500 samples received in FICS of FSSAI through ICEGATE of Customs covering 49,17,885 Metric Tonne of food consignments for issuance of NOC, 72,689 samples covering 49,02,433 Metric Tonne of consignment were cleared. In a meeting of experts comprising the representatives of the concerned Departments held in New Delhi on 06th December, 2018 under the Chairmanship of CEO, FSSAI, it was recommended that the ban on import of milk and milk products from China may be extended for a further period of four months i.e. upto 23rd April, 2019 or until the capacity of all notified laboratories for import testing across India have been suitably upgraded for testing melamine. During 2018-19, several steps have been taken for further streamlining clearance of imported food consignments including: On the basis of certain criteria i.e. risk category of food, compliance history of importer etc. in RMS, only 5 % low risk items and 25% high risk food items are referred by Customs to FSSAI for examination and clearance; Simplified provision of facility of advance filing of Bill of Entry in Food Import Clearance System (FICS) to minimize the clearance time and also the demurrage charges; Issue of Provisional NOC (P-NOC) for imported pre-packaged retail food articles and articles requiring refrigerated storage to reduce clearance time, congestion at ports and demurrage charges on importers; Monthly monitoring of the performance of testing labs to ensure correct and timely report; Recognition of food laboratories in Bhutan and Bangladesh for issuance of test analysis certificate of imported food samples; List of rectifiable labelling information has been expanded to facilitate ease of doing business while ensuring the safe food imports; FSSAI has completed mapping of ITC-HS codes of imported food items along with risk categorisation of each ITC-HS code. With its implementation on the Customs ICEGATE in March, 2018, the food imports clearance procedures have become more efficient. 13.1.5 Codex FSSAI, the National Codex Contact Point (NCCP), continues to be actively involved in coordinating and promoting Codex activities in India and ensuring India's effective participation in the Codex work related to the development of international food standards.
