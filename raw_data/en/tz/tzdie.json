Introduction [1](#B1-toxins-08-00080)]. Adverse reactions to herbal medicines and drugs accounted for 0.2% and 4.4% of acute admissions to general medical wards [ [2](#B2-toxins-08-00080), [3](#B3-toxins-08-00080)]. Surveillance of acute hospital admissions since 1989 [ [4](#B4-toxins-08-00080)] and spontaneous reports received since 2007 by the four territory-wide poison control units [ [5](#B5-toxins-08-00080), [6](#B6-toxins-08-00080), [7](#B7-toxins-08-00080)] of the Hong Kong Poison Control Network ( [http://www.hkpcn.org.hk](http://www.hkpcn.org.hk)) indicate that herbs containing or contaminated atropine, hyoscyamine and scopolamine) remain the two most important causes of herbal poisoning. The clinical presentations and investigations of Aconitum alkaloid poisoning caused by aconite roots or contaminated herbs during1989-2011 have recently been reported [ [8](#B8-toxins-08-00080), [9](#B9-toxins-08-00080)]. [10](#B10-toxins-08-00080), [11](#B11-toxins-08-00080), The peripheral effects of muscarinic receptor antagonism include: mydriasis, blurred vision, dry mouth, flushed dry skin, dry mucous membranes, hyperthermia, sinus tachycardia, hypertension, decreased bowel motility, and urinary retention. The central effects of muscarinic receptor antagonism include hallucinations, delirium, drowsiness, slurred speech, agitation, amnesia, ataxia, myoclonus, seizures, and coma. The severity of anticholinergic toxicity is generally dose-dependent. The tropane alkaloid content is the highest in the flowers of the Datura species [ [12](#B12-toxins-08-00080)]. Thus, overdose of their flowers as herbal medicines or consumption of non-toxic herbs contaminated by such plant parts is associated with a higher risk of anticholinergic poisoning [ [10](#B10-toxins-08-00080)]. Milder anticholinergic toxicity may only require supportive care. In severe cases (e.g., profound delirium), physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor, should be used to reverse anticholinergic toxicity [ [12](#B12-toxins-08-00080)]. 2. Methodology [http://www.dh.gov.hk/eindex.html](http://www.dh.gov.hk/eindex.html)). Additional articles and unpublished data were provided by the Drug and Poisons Information Bureau [ [4](#B4-toxins-08-00080)]. [4](#B4-toxins-08-00080), [6](#B6-toxins-08-00080)]. In brief, the adverse reactions, which occurred only after exposure to herbal medicines, could not be reasonably explained by the underlying medical conditions or the effects of concomitant drugs, if any. In the case of anticholinergic poisoning, the characteristic clinical features (e.g., acute confusion, mydriasis, dry mouth and sinus tachycardia) [ [10](#B10-toxins-08-00080), [11](#B11-toxins-08-00080), [12](#B12-toxins-08-00080)] should be present. A multidisciplinary team reviewed the history, clinical features, prescriptions, herbal remnants and toxicological laboratory findings [ [6](#B6-toxins-08-00080)]. The causes of anticholinergic poisoning could then be categorized as: overdoses (larger than the recommended doses used), erroneous substitution (non-toxic Flos Campsis or, rarely, Flos Rhododendri mollis substituted by Flos Daturae Metelis due to their very similar appearances) and contamination (non-toxic herbs contaminated by plants, herbs or foreign matters containing [14](#B14-toxins-08-00080)] to 2008-2012 [ [15](#B15-toxins-08-00080)]. These four reports would be reviewed in detail ( [Table 1](#toxins-08-00080-t001)). A paper with only the hospital data from June 2004 to March 2012 [ [16](#B16-toxins-08-00080)] was excluded because most of these cases were already included in the three official reports [ [13](#B13-toxins-08-00080), [14](#B14-toxins-08-00080), [15](#B15-toxins-08-00080)]. [5](#B5-toxins-08-00080)], where ~20% of the Hong Kong population lived and the PWH was, until December 1996, the only general hospital in the region. During 1989-1993, there were five cases and the incidence of herbal medicines induced anticholinergic poisoning was 0.09 per 100,000 population ( [Table 1](#toxins-08-00080-t001)). Prescriptions were available for review in three cases and the causes of herbal poisoning were contamination (40%) and substitution (20%). [Table 1](#toxins-08-00080-t001)). As from 1997 to 1999, complete data were not available because two new general hospitals in the NTE region were open in 1997-1998 and the Department of Health was establishing a territory-wide pharmacovigilance system for herbal medicines. [Table 1](#toxins-08-00080-t001)). From 2000 to June 2005, there were 12 cases of anticholinergic poisoning, with an overall incidence of 0.03 per 100,000 population [ [13](#B13-toxins-08-00080), [14](#B14-toxins-08-00080)]. The causes of poisoning were contamination of Rhizoma Atractylodis (50%), substitution (42%) and overdoses (8%). [15](#B15-toxins-08-00080)]. The causes of poisoning included contamination (50%), substitution (41%) and overdoses (5%). Of the 11 cases of contamination, the herb involved was identified in 6 (Rhizoma Atractylodis in 3, Radix Aucklandiae in 2 and Radix Strobilanthis Forrestii in 1). 4. Discussion [17](#B17-toxins-08-00080)]. In Hong Kong, pharmacovigilance has long been broadened to cover herbal medicines [ [4](#B4-toxins-08-00080), [18](#B18-toxins-08-00080)]. The territory-wide spontaneous reporting system run by the Department of Health [ [13](#B13-toxins-08-00080), [14](#B14-toxins-08-00080)] is strengthened by the close networking of the poison control units through the establishment of the Hong Kong Poison Control Network in April 2007. Poisoning cases with potential public health impact (including herbal medicines related adverse reactions) are reported by fax to the Department of Health [ [19](#B19-toxins-08-00080)] and the Hospital Authority Head Office. Since the public hospitals under the Hospital Authority account for 93% of the in-patient service in Hong Kong, most of the hospitalized cases should have been identified. As the surveillance and investigations of poisoning incidents are enhanced, control measures can be implemented in a timely manner [ [9](#B9-toxins-08-00080), [18](#B18-toxins-08-00080)]. Poisoning incidents requiring urgent attention include adverse reactions due to contamination or substitution by toxic herbs. [8](#B8-toxins-08-00080), [9](#B9-toxins-08-00080), [20](#B20-toxins-08-00080)], anticholinergic poisoning is a high priority, in view of the potency of tropane alkaloids, the severity of toxic symptoms [ [12](#B12-toxins-08-00080)] and the risk of death [ [21](#B21-toxins-08-00080)]. Because tropane alkaloids are fairly heat-stable [ [22](#B22-toxins-08-00080)], boiling (decoction) of herbs does not provide protection. The incidence and the underlying reasons for the continuing occurrence of herbal medicines induced anticholinergic poisoning should be identified. [Table 1](#toxins-08-00080-t001)). In the NTE, the incidence of anticholinergic poisoning decreased from 0.09 in 1989-1993 to 0 in 1994-1996 per 100,000 population. A marked decrease in the incidence of aconite poisoning was also seen in the NTE, from 0.60 in 1989-1991 to 0.16 in 1992-1993 and 0.17 in 1996-1998 per 100,000 population) [ [8](#B8-toxins-08-00080)]. Perhaps, the publicity measures in late 1991 by the health authority to warn the public, healthcare professionals and herbalists of the toxicity of aconite roots [ [23](#B23-toxins-08-00080)] helped promote the appropriate use of other herbs as well. In the whole of Hong Kong, the number of reports received by the Department of Health indicated an increase in the incidence of anticholinergic poisoning from 0.03 in 2000-June 2005 to 0.06 in 2008-2012 per 100,000 population. As anticholinergic poisoning is a serious condition with characteristic clinical features [ [10](#B10-toxins-08-00080), [11](#B11-toxins-08-00080), [12](#B12-toxins-08-00080)] and there is close networking of poison control units [ [6](#B6-toxins-08-00080), [19](#B19-toxins-08-00080)] with well-established channels for reporting by the healthcare professionals [ [13](#B13-toxins-08-00080), [14](#B14-toxins-08-00080)], under-reporting and missed diagnosis are less likely. [6](#B6-toxins-08-00080), [24](#B24-toxins-08-00080)], but their relative importance is rarely studied in a systematic manner [ [8](#B8-toxins-08-00080), [9](#B9-toxins-08-00080)]. In anticholinergic poisoning, the available information from Hong Kong clearly indicated that contamination of other non-toxic herbs by plants, herbs or foreign matters containing tropane alkaloids and erroneous substitution of Flos Campsis by toxic Flos Daturae Metelis were always the two predominant causes ( [Table 1](#toxins-08-00080-t001)). Contamination of non-toxic herbs by (impurities containing) tropane alkaloids should be suspected if anticholinergic poisoning occurred even though Flos Daturae Metelis and related herbs were not prescribed or dispensed. Contamination of dispensed herbs could occur at various stages, such as after harvest, processing, transportation, packing, storage and dispensing. On-site investigations by the Department of Health would exclude accidental mix-up and cross-contamination at the retailer. Samples of dispensed herbs were examined for gross contamination and analyzed for the presence of tropane alkaloids. If contamination was confirmed, the public, the healthcare professionals and the herbal trade should be warned. If herbal samples from the wholesaler were also contaminated and contamination must have occurred before import into Hong Kong, the regulatory authorities of exporting countries should also be notified for follow-up actions. So far, Rhizoma Atractylodis was involved more often than other non-toxic herbs (see Results). Further systematic studies along the supply chain are required to identify the likely sources of contamination so that risk management strategies can be formulated. [15](#B15-toxins-08-00080)]. The dried forms of Flos Campsis and Flos Daturae Metelis have very Flos Campsis was prescribed, Flos Daturae Metelis was actually Metelis and Flos Campsis g, respectively [ [15](#B15-toxins-08-00080)]. Anticholinergic poisoning invariably occurred because of the overdose (8-15 times) since Flos Daturae Metelis was dispensed according to the prescribed dose for Flos Campsis. Therefore, regular inspection of the retailer, continuing education for the staff in the herbal trade and repeated publicity measures would be required. If erroneous substitution of Flos Campsis by Flos Daturae Metelis could be prevented, the recent data suggested that 40% of the anticholinergic poisoning would not have occurred ( [Table 1](#toxins-08-00080-t001)). 5.
