I had gotten in a car accident back in February where I was rear ended and had some injuries to my neck, back and shoulder. I had gone to a chiropractor that had been recommended by my lawyer. It was such a horrible experience. The doctor at that location had the worst bedside manner. So bad that upon coming to him the day after my accident he did an evaluation that lasted no longer than 10 minutes where he proceeded to then literally toss a heavy hot pack on my back that looked like it hadn't been cleaned for years. Mind you, I was pretty acute at that moment where I could hardly move my body. I decided after a few visits of going to this dimwit that I had to find a chiropractor of my choosing since the only care of been getting to that point was stimulator for 15 minutes a visit with the same old dirty pack, no progress I'm sight. I was hesitant to see another chiropractor after such a bad experience. But after reading reviews for Dr. Tang I felt like I might be in good hands. And let me say, I couldn't have made a better decision than to visit Dr. Tang. He was extremely thorough with explaining my injuries and the plan for treatment. His experience and knowledge clearly showed his expertise. Every time o had questions he was always thorough with his evaluations on the issues with my muscle pain, spine and how one thing relayed to the other. I came into his office with high anxiety and Dr. Tang very calmly and skillfully alleviated any of the fears that I had. I feel much better than when I came to him the first day and although I'm not 100% there, I'm so thankful for the progress I've made. Thank you Dr. Tang and your wonderful staff. - 7/19/2022 The office is clean, professional, and nice decors. The receptionist always friendly and being helpful. Dr. Tang is really knowledgeable. He would tell you what is the issue, and what is he going to do to fix it, very thorough. I had a lower back pain, he was able to fix it and corrected the stiffness on my neck and my shoulder. That is like Buy 1 Get 2 free . I also recommeneded my parents here, and they are very please with Dr. Tang. - 6/29/2022 I absolutely recommend this place. Before going here I had gone to several drs for a bad ankle sprain, it was about 2 months and I couldn't walk still. Someone my boyfriend knew recommended this place and I ended up making an appt. The treatment was super efficient and through and in a couple of weeks I was back to normal. The dr and the staff are amazing and they truly care about their patients. I had injured myself again and immediately gotten back to this place. Would highly recommend. - 11/15/2022 Through my treatment I have sleepless nights where I needed medication to sleep. Throughout My treatment I found my upper spine and cervical (neck) were misaligned and compressed. Now I have worked with Dr. Huynh understanding the problem and finding a solution. Having better experience with sleep and less pain Throughout the day. I'll recommend Dr. Huynh and continue treatment with him - 3/13/2022 A few weeks ago I tweaked my back and could barely move without severe pain. My wife recommended this place to me and set up an appointment. After a few sessions I was able to move around without severe pain and within a week my pain decreased about 80%. I would definitely recommend them! - 2/23/2021 I usually don't write reviews but I would like to take my time to say; Dr. Tang is a great chiropractor. It was my first time getting adjusted. He was very hospitable and took his time to educate me on the procedures. He gave me consultation, treatment and he's open on the weekend; plus his clinic can take X-RAY photos. I felt wonderful after the adjustment. I would definitely recommend his chiropractic healthcare. Health is wealth. - 1/10/2021 I've had back issues for a few years . I do construction work and do a lot of heavy lifting. Know that I've been going constantly I've been able to feel alot better please come give him a try you won't be disappointed - 3/2/2017 Hello- I'd want to thank Dr. Tang and his Team in providing excellent professional care for my injuries. Dr. Tang is very knowledgeable and is an experienced physician that has guided me towards my recovery. Thank you Dr. Tang for taking care of me and giving me life learning advice for my health! - 9/8/2016Updated review They moved to a newer and more beautiful office. :) I love it! After my X-ray, Dr Huynh can pull it up and show it to me in the adjustment room on monitor on the wall. Very advance4/18/2012Previous review I love coming here, Dr. Huynh was very nice And thorough. He gave me a treatments plan and fix my problem. - 2/20/2018 Possibly the BEST chiropractor you will ever find! The modern, inviting office is housed in a brand-new strip mall located across from Costco gas station. The lobby is clean and bright. There are comfy, stylish chairs with magazines and a flat-screen tv. Futuristic white and metallic orbs are suspended from the ceiling and calming new age music plays in the background. The chic, friendly receptionist at the counter also multi-tasks as Dr. Tang's secretary, assistant, sanitation engineer and most notably, his wife--and they work well together. She's been very gracious and accommodating with appointments. Dr. Tang (actually, it's Dr. Huynh, but he's affectionately called by his first name) is a vigorous, thoughtful man who listens and explains with great care and experience. I've had back troubles since I was in my twenties, and I've visited more chiropractors than I'd care to count. But my problems never really went away and I learned to live with/manage my pain. But not so with Dr. Tang. In all my years of chiropractic, I've never had a D.C. who sat down and explained my back illness in detail with me and made a health plan and timeline for back improvement. Dr. Tang was the first to explain my back's status (including old injuries from the past) using my x-rays and physical models. He pointed out some bad habits I have developed over the years which intensify pain. I was given \"homework\" that was reasonable and easy enough to do on my own. He explained what kinds of things I can do actively to maintain daily healthy back posture. We also calendared a future goal date to take new x-rays and compare for growth. Dr. Tang applies his combined knowledge and strength (this man is strong!) to get to the root of back pain and good back health. He lifts pulls, and drills with an ox's strength and a grand piano tuner's precision. All the technology is new, including in-house xray machine and the amazing traction machine. I appreciate Dr. Tang because he helps explain away the clinical \"mysteries\" and helps educate his patients to improve and recover from painful situations and poor habits. When I think about my horrific pain--and sleep loss-- when I first came in, it's pretty phenomenal that less than a year later, I am pain free and back in the gym 3x a week. I strongly recommend Dr. Tang Huynh if you are looking for someone with years of experience and knowledge in his area. He is hands-down the most knowledgeable and caring chiropractor I've come across. THANKS, DR. TANG, for helping me get my LIFE back ~ YOU ROCK!!! Other Chiropractors Nearby [read "}
