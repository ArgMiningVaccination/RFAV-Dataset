Complementary approaches to treating Parkinson's Disease can include [yoga,](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/what-is-parkinsons/treatment-medication/alternative-treatment/yoga/) massage, and [acupuncture](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/acupuncture-and-massage-for-parkinsons-disease/). Even [music therapy](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/music-therapy-parkinsons-disease/) and [art therapy](/article/art-therapy-parkinsons-disease/) have been used to treat Parkinson's symptoms. If you are considering complementary therapies, consult with your neurologist or primary care physician. It is important for all those involved in your treatment to be working together. If you are thinking of taking any supplements or herbs, or [CBD products](https://www.apdaparkinson.org/article/cannabidiol-and-parkinsons-disease/), inform your physician as some of them can interfere with conventional drug treatments. Avoid practitioners who claim to \"cure\" Parkinson's disease, and any who advise abruptly stopping or weaning off prescription medications. It takes time to investigate and prove the safety and efficacy of any treatment. In recent years, researchers have begun to focus more specifically on complementary therapies and we will continue to learn about their potential benefits and risks. In the meantime, discover what is best for you by being an informed consumer. "}
