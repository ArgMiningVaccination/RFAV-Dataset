Over the course of life\u2014whether due to the environment, emotional challenges, or simply the stresses of everyday life\u2014that energy can become stagnant, blocked or unbalanced. While our energies are remarkably resilient, after enough time these blocks and disharmonies may manifest as illness, fatigue, depression, allergies or other difficulties. We give a lot of names to a lot of different diseases, but the truth is that beneath the symptoms is a breakdown in the body's energies. Defining Energy Work Energy work is a holistic practice that activates the body's subtle energy systems to remove energetic blocks and imbalances. In releasing these energetic blocks, the body's natural inherent ability to rebalance and heal itself is stimulated. Energy work can be described as dramatic shifts in healing happenings and being recognized. We are a latticework of energies; these energies shape how we feel, think and live. Energy therapists and bioenergetic practitioners combine acquired knowledge and intuitive understanding of body energies in various modalities. Energy work is also known as energy medicine, energy healing, subtle energy healing, mind-body medicine and vibrational medicine. The term energy medicine was coined in the 1980s to describe a form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). According to most CAM philosophies, both physical and mental health imbalances and conditions tend to arise when our energy is stuck or not flowing properly. The goal of energy healing work is to restore energetic balance to support physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. Energy work is based on the construct that the body is permeated by an energy field that can affect our health and well-being, also called subtle energy, vibrational energy or simply life force, known as qi (chi) in Traditional Chinese Medicine or prana in Ayurveda. It is understood that we can work with this energy to find rebalance and healing. Energy Healing's Scientific Principles Energy healing practices can involve physically touching the body or working non-physically with the body's energy. The latter type of practice can be done remotely through a process known as quantum entanglement, which has recently been recognized for a Nobel Prize.
