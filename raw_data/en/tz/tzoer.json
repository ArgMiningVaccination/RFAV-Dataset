Students will develop s kills and abilities to foster effective clinical practice which are grounded in the contemporary concept of healthcare delivery . The program's foundation is based on three assumptions. First, the welfare of the patient/client is the basis of healthcare. While h ealth care professi onals may be involved in several areas of practice , e.g., clinical care, research, education, administration, and consultation , the welfare of the patient/client is the focal point of their efforts. Second, healthcare practice is dynamic. Changes occur constantly and incorporate advances in assessment and treatment , as well a s guidelines of governing bodies and payors . The physical therapy scope of practice has widened to include the promotion of health and prevention of illness and includes an emphasis on the rights and responsibilities of the patient/client. Third, quality healthcare is dependent on the delivery process of healthcare service s and the extent to which individual patient/client needs are met. Skills and abilities must be developed in DPT students to enable the graduate to practice safely, professionally , and effectively in a 'direct access' environment . Emory DPT Program Competencies The student will use the problem -solving process (also known as clinical reasoni ng) to demonstrate areas of competence and apply a theoretical framework of basic, behavioral, social , and medical sciences to the practice of physical therapy. Competency is demonstrated by: A. Using the interpersonal communication process with patients, healthcare providers , and staff ; including an active recognition of the rights and dignity of the individual in planning and administering programs of care. B. Using the teaching -learning process in interactions with patients, healthc are providers , and staff. C. Providing physical therapy patient care by examining and evaluating patients, providing therapeutic services, and establishing an appropriate plan of care. D. Participating in the administrative responsibilities of a clinical physic al therapist. E. Using the basic principles of research in the critical analysis of concepts and findings generated by self and others. F. Consulting with others to provid e comprehensive care. The educational experience of the program is designed to meet these competencies in the following ways: A. The problem -solving approach is utilized to identif y and affect the needs of a patient/client and of the healthcare system. A physical therapist must n ot only be able to work as a member of the interprofessional team, but also assume a leadership role in initiating interprofessional care. They must identify and resolve health problems through patient/client planning , and contribute to 11 specialty practice , and the healthcare system. For that reason, the problem -solving approach is used in all aspects of the DPT program. In each of the previous contexts, the physical therapist must be able to identify a need(s) and alternative plans for resolution, and implement and modify the plan, as necessary. The physical therapist, other health care professionals , the patient/client and the healthcare system are all involved in the process and considered in effecting solutions to specific problems. B. Interpersonal communications , including an active recognition of the rights and dignity of the patient/client , are emphasized in all aspects of the DPT program. This is demonstrated by consideration of the personal, community, and cultural environment of the patient/client. Specific interpersonal communication skills include the ability to facilitate discussion and communicate decisions based on the human dignity of the diverse population involved, to grow personally and to facilitate growth in others, and to respond effectively to the interpersonal needs of the patient/client, of self, and of other health professionals. Humanistic factors are considered along with economic factors in determining goals of healthcare. Psychosocial considerations are integrated into the content areas, clinical experiences, and process skills. C. The teaching -learning process is applicable to the student's own learning, both during and after completion of the program. Lifelong learning is essential to contemporary evidence -based practice . For that reason, the student's understanding of how a person learns and what the person needs to learn is developed. Teaching knowledge and skills are developed by familiarizing the student with the instructional process designed to facilitate the student's learning in classroom and clinical settings , where c lassro om and clinical faculty serve as models. Finally, the student is given an opportunity to develop skill in a) identifying what a patient/client needs to learn to accomplish their goals , b) identifying and implementing the best method of teaching to the patient/client, and c) determining if the desired learning has occurred. The application of these skills in collegial , interprofessional relationships is also experienced by the student. D. A physical therapist's area of expertise is the movement function of pat ients/clients and/or the use of therapeutic approaches to affect function. Generally, physical therapists are specialists in motor behavior, including the neuromusculoskeletal, pulmonary and cardiovascular, and cognitive systems. Basic content areas, whic h provide theoretical basis in the medical sciences, are: 1) Human growth and development 2) Typical structure and function 3) Disturbances in homeostasis as manifested by various pathophysiologies 4) Related medical and physical therapy management 5) Eth ics, professionalism , and health services management. 12 Knowledge and skills in these areas are naturally sequenced, i.e., birth to aging, function to dysfunction, and general to specific. Organization of information related to the medical and clinical sciences is based on the homeostatic mode l. Accordingly, content is organized by clusters of clinical problems rather than by medical discipline or physical therapy technique. Specific content areas are integrated throughout the DPT program , i.e., each content area with others, classroom experiences with clinical experiences, and content areas w ith the process skills. E. Skills essential to evidence -based practice such as administrat ion, consultation, and research and are observed and practiced by the student in the clinic and classroom. F. The program's educational design reflects contemporary healt hcare practice and the objectives of the program. Integration of learning and the humanistic approach accustoms the student to focusing on the patient/client's changing needs. Use of a problem -solving approach in program planning provides a mechanism for r esponding to the problems of patients/clients and affecting the positive change in the healthcare system. Finally, development of process skills necessary for the many roles of a physical therapist enables the student to participate in a variety of setting s in a dynamic healthcare system. 13 Program Logistics 14 EMORY DOCTOR OF PHYSICAL THERAPY Class of 2026 3 Year - Tentative Academic Calendar (Dates Subject to Change.)

What is a DPT Learning Community? A small group of DPT students and faculty advisors who intentionally gather together over the 3 years of the DPT program to support and learn from each other. 2. What are some benefits of learning communities? Learning communities foster faculty and student connection by cre ating a safe space for discussing the DPT program, professional practice , and professional development topics , amongst other student generated ideas. It is an opportunity for self -reflection and collaborative learning. 3. Will I also get an academic advisor? Your learning community advisors are your academic advisors. If you have any questions or concerns at any time, reach out to them. 4. Do the learning communities do anything other than meet and talk? Yes, in addition to traditional meeting s, we also have opportunities to walk together through Lullwater Park or take part in a social event on or off campus. COVID -19 impacted our ability to gather the last few years, but plans are in the works for a Field Day and service -learning opportunities. If you h ave other ideas, let your learning community advisors know. 5. When do we meet? During the first semester, we meet every few weeks to help get you acclimated to the Program. As the program continues, we typically meet monthly . The schedule will be provided t o you in advance. 6. What if I have ideas for a learning community topic or event Share it with your learning community advisor or Drs. Caston, Phillips, Sharp and Bullock. They coordinate the learning community curriculum. 37 DOCTOR OF PHYSICAL THERAPY CLASS OF 202 6 Emory Doctor of Physical Therapy Learning Communities Learning Community 1: Drs.

Students requiring accommodation s should contact Emory's Department of Accessibility Services (DAS) . This office offers a wide variety of services to students with documented disabilities , and is responsible for managing access needs , providing Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) accommodations , ensuring compliance with local, state, and federal civil rights regulations pertaining to disability law, and serving as a critical resource for the enterprise, it is DAS's role to embody Em ory's commitment to its mission \"in work and deed.\" DAS assists eligible students and faculty/staff in obtaining a variety of services (i.e., alternative testing, note taking, interpreting, advocacy, mobility/transportation, etc.) and ensures all matters of equal access, reasonable accommodation, and compliance are properly addressed. Eligible students and faculty/staff must register and request services. Confidentiality is honored and maintained. In compliance with the ADA , Emory University School of Med icine is committed to making reasonable accommodations to assist students with documented disabilities to fulfill their educational objectives. Students who wish to request accommodations under the ADA must follow the University's procedures for verificati on of eligibility by submitting supporting documentation to DAS. Requesting Accommodations and Determining Initial Eligibility Students who need accommodations to participate fully in Emory's programs must file a formal request for accommodations with DAS. This includes students who may develop an impairment due to an illness, accident, or surgery. DAS may also be contacted about potential accommodations for a temporary disability. It is crucial to contact DAS as soon as possible, but at a minimum, immediately after registering for classes each semester or following the development of an impairment. This allows DAS to adequately co ordinate services and provide instructors with reasonable notice. Students new to Emory or the accommodations process must follow DAS policies and procedures for determining initial eligibility. Determination of eligibility for DAS services and accommoda tions is not part of the admission process. 40 Fill out Emory's student registration form and submit it along with the appropriate medical/disab ility documentation. A DAS staff member will review the application materials and determine appropriate accommodations specific to the individual's disabilities. Accommodations are developed for students on an individual basis and, depending on the course content and format, may vary by semester or term. Students will be apprised of ADA eligibility within the timeframe that is established by DAS. If a request for eligibility verification is made at the start of an academic period, accommodations cannot be implemented until the student's registration is finalized with DAS. Because of the number of verifications being processed at the beginning of the academic period, students are urged to submit their request for eligibility verification and accommodations as far in advance as possible. Advance preparation will ensure the smoothest availability of needed accommodations. If a student is determined to be eligible for reasonable accommodations, a DAS staff member will meet with the student to discuss approved ac commodations. Otherwise, DAS may assist the student in identifying voluntary and readily achievable means for meeting their needs. Students have the primary responsibility of advocating for themselves during the accommodation process. They should not rely on their parents, faculty members, or others to do so for them. Any confidential records and documentation submitted by the student to DAS will be retained and kept confidential. To register with DAS, please visit this website and follow the instructions. https://accessibility.emory.edu/index.html Implementing Accommodations After registe ring with DAS and receiving approved accommodations, the student will request an accommodation notification letter via the Accommodate portal. This is an official notice of the individual's ADA eligibility and guidelines related to reasonable accommodation s appropriate for the individual's needs. No information about the student's diagnosis, condition or history will be available in any way to course instructors or others from whom a student might request an accommodation. Once a student's ADA eligibility has been verified, there is no need to repeat the registration process unless the student's situation or needs change. However, s tudents must request accommodation letters each semester . It is each student's responsibility to contact Ms. Ella Pollard and/or Dr. Tami Phillips in the Division of Physical Therapy , as well as each course director, to provide a copy of the official notification letter and to schedule a meeting to discuss EUSOM' s policy for the administration of accommodations. Mrs. Pollard will maintain a password protected electronic folder containing all accommodation letters for each student. Such material will be retained separately from the student's academic file, and acce ss to such material will be limited and appropriate confidentiality will be maintained. The school will not release details related to accommodations that were provided (for example to residency programs, etc.). 41 The course faculty, Mrs. Pollard, and Dr. P hillips will collaborate on the implementation of accommodations. The SOM's Associate Dean of Student Success, Dr. Christen Hairston , oversees the implementation of accommodations across all programs in the SOM. Unless a request is made, and the student authorizes release of the information regarding the need for accommodations to appropriate others (faculty, staff, etc.), the medical school will not proceed with arranging accommodations. No retroactive consideration will be given to students who fail to request or to complete the approval process. If an adjustment to an accommodation is needed, it is the student's responsibility to reach out to DAS. Accommodations are only determined by DAS. Accommodations Testing Policy 1. To utilize approved accommodations, it is the student's responsibility to contact the course director at the beginning of each term they are registered and submit the official accommodation letter from the Department of Accessibility Services. 2. Coordinate testing requirements with course faculty and Mrs. Pollard at least 2 weeks prior to the test. 3. Since both the student and their professor will need to complete several steps, it's important to verify that everything is ready before the date of each exam. 4. You are required to adh ere to your test day schedule , unless otherwise notified by your course instructor .

In general, misconduct and harassment complaints aga inst employees and other non -students are handled under Policy 1.3. UNIVERSITY POLICY 8.2 This policy specifically addresses processes for alleged sexual misconduct committed by an Emory student. The policy states that Title IX of the Education Amendmen ts of 1972 protects people from discrimination in educational programs and activities at institutions receiv ing federal financial assistance, and that Emory University will take seriously every allegation or report of sexual misconduct. 43 Please note the Of fice of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion does not investigate complaints of discrimination, discriminatory harassment, and retaliation filed against students. Those complaints are investigated by the Division of Campus Life's Office of Student Conduct. 44 EMORY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT Expectations Emory University is an institution dedicated to providing educational opportunities for its students, transmitting and advancing knowledge, and providing a wide range of services to students and to the general community. To accomplish these objectives and responsibilities requires that the University be free from violence, threats, and intimidation; protective of free inquiry and dissent; respectf ul of the rights of others; open to change; supportive of democratic and lawful procedure; and dedicated to intellectual integrity and a rational approach to the resolution of human problems. The tradition of the university as a sanctuary of academic free dom and center of informed discussion is an honored one, to be guarded vigilantly. The basic significance of that sanctuary lies in the protection of intellectual freedoms: the rights of professors to teach; of scholars to engage in the advancement of know ledge; of students to learn and express their views. Health professionals are privileged to serve in important and time -honored roles as caregivers for other humans. These roles include physical and emotional dimensions that demand the highest degree of ethical behavior. Professional behavior includes, but is not in any way limited to honesty, maintaining confidentiality, trustworthiness, professional demeanor, respect for the rights of others, personal accountability, and concern for the welfare of patie nts, and responsibility to duty: Honesty - Being truthful in communication with all others, while in the healthcare arena or in the community at large. Maintenance of Patient Confidentiality - Restricting discussion of patient care to those areas where conversations cannot be overheard by other s outside of the care team; refraining from disclosing patient identity to those not connected to the care of the patient; maintaining appropriate security for all paper and electronic patient records, whether in the patient care or research realms. Trust worthiness - Being dependable; following through on responsibilities in a timely manner. Professional Communication and Demeanor - Being thoughtful and kind when interacting with patients, their families, other members of the healthcare team, and all other s; maintaining civility in all relationships; striving to maintain composure under pressures of fatigue, professional stress or personal problems; maintaining a neat and clean appearance and dress in attire that is reasonable and accepted as professional t o the circumstances; refraining from intoxication; abstaining from the illegal use of drugs (both prescription and illicit drugs). 45 Respect for the rights of others - Dealing with all others, whether in a professional or non -professional setting, in a cons iderate manner and with a spirit of cooperation; respecting the rights of patients and their families to be informed and share in patient care decisions; respecting patients' modesty and privacy. Personal accountability - Participating responsibly in pati ent care to the best of one's ability and with appropriate supervision; undertaking clinical duties and persevering until they are complete; notifying the responsible person if one is unable to perform clinical tasks effectively; complying with University Policies and Procedures in an honest and forthright manner. Concern for the welfare of patients - Treating patients and their families with respect and dignity both in their presence and in discussions with others; avoiding the use of foul language, offen sive gestures or inappropriate remarks ; discerning accurately when supervision or advice is needed and seeking these out before acting; recognizing when one's ability to function effectively is compromised and asking for relief or help; never administerin g care, in person or over the phone while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs (prescription or illegal); not engaging in romantic, sexual, or other nonprofessional relationships with a patient, even upon the apparent request of a patient; advocat ing for the best care of the patient, in context of that patient's beliefs and desires. Responsibility to duty - Effectively undertaking duties with alacrity [eagerness, enthusiasm and promptness are synonyms] and persevering until complete, or notifying a responsible more senior person of a problem; being punctual for class, small groups, rounds, conferences and other duties; timely notification of supervisory faculty, residents and Deans of absences or an inability to carry out assigned duties; seeing pat ients regularly and assuming responsibility for their care with appropriate supervision; identifying emergencies and responding appropriately; and being available to faculty or staff personnel when on duty. 46 DPT STUDENT CONDUCT The American Physical Therapy Association's Vision 2020 statement considers professionalism as a core component of a Doctor of Physical Therapy. Therefore, the faculty in the Division of Physical Therapy strive to uphold professional standards by modeling and enforcing professional behaviors in our students. Enforcement of these behaviors will be reflected as a percentage of each course grade. Student Conduct In addition to any new conduct guidelines to be approved by the Division of Physical Therapy facu lty and students, all students must abide by the following: a. Emory University School of Medicine Conduct Code b. Rules of Georgia State Board of Physical Therapy c. The Ethical Code stated in the Georgia Law governing the Practice of Physical Therapy d. The APTA's Code of Ethics for Physical Therapists and Core Values e. Separation of Roles Student Conduct in Classroom It is everyone's responsibility to foster a mutually respectful learning environment in the classroom. Accor dingly, there are very high expectations about professional behavior in this program. The following unprofessional behaviors are disruptive to everyone and therefore should be avoided during our class meetings: 1. Arriving late. (Please explain your tardiness to the instructor immediately following the class) 2. Holding side conversations. (If you have a question about the class material, please raise your hand and ask it, rather than whispering it to your neighbor. Chances are good that if you have a question ab out what's happening, then many of your classmates may also have the very same question. If you have to discuss something unrelated to class with a classmate, then please wait until after class.) 3. Inattention (e.g., reading unrelated materials or studying f or other classes). 4. Personal attacks, or comments of a disrespectful or insulting nature. 47 DPT STUDENT DRESS CODE The Division of Physical Therapy has guidelines for appropriate dress with the goals of fostering professional behavior and to show respect to others and the healthcare environment in which we exist.

Wherever applicable the student will follow the Division of Physical Therapy's Student Conduct and Academic Policies as included in this manual . Upon matriculation in Emory University School of Medicine, each student agrees to be bound by the rules, policies, procedures , and administrative regulations as they exist at the time of admission and as they may be changed by duly constituted authority. Therefore, students enrolled in the School of Medicine are under the jurisdiction of the student conduct standards and procedural guidelines of Emory University. Certain aspects of student conduct as related to students in the School of Medicine call for special consideration since such students are carefully selected on the basis of both academic capabiliti es and personal characteristics, particularly related to matters of integrity and propriety. The policies of student conduct in the School of Medicine and the procedures in the case of alleged misconduct were formulated by the officers of the Medical Scho ol Administration and of the student body and have been approved by the Dean of the School. Misconduct would result when a student violates the principles or specifics of these areas of conduct as viewed either by other students, faculty and/or public off icials charged with enforcing the law of their jurisdiction. An action by students indicating lack of integrity or dishonesty in academic matters is considered a violation of academic ethics. The se offense s include, but are not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, falsifying, or knowingly passing off work of another as one's own. Cheating includes acquiring, receiving or passing on information about the content of an examination knowingly prior to its authorized release or during its administration. Unless allowed by the instructor, obtaining or passing on of exam copies from previous years in not allowed in this program. This memorandum is to remind you that any student who commits an act of dishonesty, i.e., cheating, plagiarism or falsification, will be brought before the Honor Council . If the charges of the alleged misconduct are upheld, then the student will be penalized according to the decision of the council. . There is no acceptable excuse for dishonesty. To prevent questionable acts of cheating, all examinations are monitored carefully. All students have the right of appeal as outlined in the University Conduct Code should they be falsely accused. Should y ou have further questions concerning the Student Conduct Code, please contact the Director. 60 SOM Introduction Given the goals of the University as a place of academic freedom, and the School of Medicine as a site of training for highly ethical heal th care providers, a system is necessary to provide the proper balance between the academic freedoms allowed a member of the University and his or her responsibility as a future health care professional. For this purpose and in accordance with the Bylaws o f the University, the President of the University has defined the interests of the University community to be promoted and protected by such a system and has delegated to the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs for the School of Medicine the responsibility of designing and maintaining a conduct code for Emory School of Medicine students. This Code may be reviewed annually, and changes require the approval of the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affai rs and approval by the Senior Vice President and Dean for Campus Life. Provisions of this Code may be revised, supplemented, or amended at any time by action of the appropriate University authorities. From the time an individual accepts an offer of admis sion to a program of the School of Medicine until the day of completion of the degree program and graduation from Emory University he or she is considered a student of the School of Medicine and governed by the principles set forth within this Conduct Code . The Emory University School of Medicine Conduct Code pertains to misconduct of medical and health professions students enrolled in the School of Medicine outside of an academic setting. Academic and professional discipline of students is not covered by this Code but rather falls within the jurisdiction of either the School of Medicine Honor Code or the Student Progress Committee. Basic Expectations/Inherent Authority The primary purpose for the imposition of non -academic discipline in the School of Medicine setting is to protect and preserve the quality of the educational environment in the campus community. This purpose entails several basic expectations: That the School of Medicine and the University at large assumes high standards of courtesy, integrity, and responsibility in all its members. That each student is responsible for his/her conduct and that continuation as a student is conditional upon compliance with the requirements of student conduct expressed or implied in this Code. The Schoo l of Medicine reserves the right to take necessary and appropriate action to protect the safety and well -being of the campus community and the patients we serve. The Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs is charged with the wel fare of all medical and health professions 61 programs students. Accordingly, in emergencies, this individual has full authority to deal with student conduct according to the exigencies of the emergency and for its duration. The School of Medicine is not de signed or equipped to rehabilitate students who do not abide by this Code. It may be necessary to remove those students from the campus and to sever the institution's relationship with them as provided in this Code. The Senior Vice President and Dean for Campus Life is delegated responsibility pertaining to all student organizations and student government and, in conjunction with the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs, has the responsibility and authority to discipline such organizations whose members are students within the School of Medicine. Confidentiality The details of Conduct or Progress and Promotions meetings are confidential and will not be released outside the University without the student's specific written per mission except as provided by applicable law. If a student is found to have violated the Conduct Code, the resulting sanctions can be included in any performance assessment or letter of recommendation requested by the student or an outside entity. Conduct Code violations and sanctions may also be reported to other agencies, such as the military, the federal government, licensing boards, and others if requested by the agency and accompanied by a signed release from the student. Violations of the Law and Cod e Students may be accountable both to civil authorities and to the University for acts that constitute violations of law and of this Code. Those accused of violations of this Code are subject to the disciplinary proceedings outlined in this Code while cr iminal, civil, or other internal proceedings regarding the same conduct are pending. Accused students may not challenge the disciplinary proceedings outlined in this Code on the grounds that criminal charges, civil actions, or other internal proceedings r egarding the same incident are pending, may be initiated, or have been terminated, dismissed, reduced, or not yet adjudicated. The University will refer matters to federal, state, and local authorities for prosecution when appropriate. Prohibited Conduct Each student may be subject to this Code whether misconduct occurs on University premises, at University or School of Medicine sponsored activities, or at any location off -campus when such conduct is brought to the attention of the Univ ersity or the School of Medicine. 62 It is neither possible nor necessary to specify every instance of misconduct that could result in disciplinary action against a student.

The Emory School of Medicine seeks to involve every member of the community in cultivating a culture of academic integrity and promoting communal standards. Pursuant to this goal, the students, faculty, and administration of t he Emory School of Medicine have created the Honor Code, which presents our standards of academic integrity and outlines the consequences for violations thereof. Honor Code The students, faculty, and administration of the Emory University School of Medicine join in support of this Student Honor Code for the purposes of (a) providing an atmosphere of mutual trust, concern, and respect; (b) fostering honorable and ethical behav ior; and c) cultivating lifelong professional conduct. To promote this purpose, matters regarding academic misconduct shall fall under the jurisdiction of the Honor Code, while other aspects of a student's medical education will be covered by the guideline s stated in the Student Conduct Code. Students who matriculate in the Emory University School of Medicine are obligated to uphold the Honor Code. To promote this purpose, matters regarding academic misconduct shall fall under the jurisdiction of the Honor Code. Matters outside of those that fall within the jurisdiction of the Honor Code, such as violations of the Student Conduct Code, will be handled in accordance with the applicable policy. Students who matriculate in the Emory University School of Medici ne must agree to abide by and uphold the Honor Code. Statement of the Academic Health Programs Honor Code A. Any action indicating lack of integrity and/or dishonesty in academic matters is considered a violation of academic ethics. Such offenses include, but are not limited to, engaging in or attempting to engage in cheating, plagiarism, sabotage, falsifying or manipulating data, misrepresenting attendance, or knowingly passing off work of another as one's own. 1. Cheating: Cheating includes knowingly acquiri ng, receiving, or passing on information about the content of an examination prior to its authorized release or during its 65 administration, provision or utilization of un -authorized aids, or impermissible collaboration. 2.

Sabotage: Sabotage is defined as intentional and malicious actions that impair another student's academic performance. 4. Falsifyi ng or manipulating data: Falsifying or manipulating data is the act of creating, enhancing, or otherwise changing actual results in academic, clinical, or research matters. B. Acts observed that appear to be in violation of the Honor Code must be reported to the Honor Council as detailed below. Failure on the part of a student to report such apparent violation will itself be considered a violation of the Honor Code. C. Students are expected to abide by the terms of the Honor Code and a lack of knowledge of the actions prohibited by the Honor Code is not a valid defense and does not excuse a violation of the Honor Code. D. To uphold this Honor Code and its purpose, an instructor may ask students to sign the following pledge at the end of all final examinations, quizz es, and other important projects: \"On my honor, I have neither given nor received any aid on this (examination, quiz, or paper), nor am I aware of anyone who did. \" E. The absence of this pledge does not exempt the student or the assignment from abiding by th is Honor Code. F. Each student upon entering the School of Medicine must sign a matriculation pledge stating that the student has read, understands, and is aware of the student's responsibilities under the Honor Code. The Academic Health Student Council on Honor The Academic Health (AH) Professions Student Honor Council (hereafter referred to as the Honor Council) will have jurisdiction over the supervision of the Honor Code as it applies to students in the Academic Health Professions Programs.

The Chair and members of the Honor Council, and the student alleged to have violated the Honor Code, may ask questions of witnesses. 5. The chair wi ll determine whether the hearing board can properly weigh or take into consideration any evidence offered by a party or witness based upon relevance. Rules of evidence applicable to criminal or civil court proceedings will not apply. 6. Discussion and deliber ation by the Council is held in a private executive session. 7. After all admissible evidence has been reviewed, the hearing panel shall deliberate to decide the case. B. Rules Governing Proceedings: 1. All hearings will be conducted in closed -door session and will remain confidential. 2. Participants in the hearing will be limited to the following: Chair (or Vice -Chair) of the Honor Council. The seven selected Honor Council Representatives (2 Faculty, 5 Students, not including the Chair). The Secretary or, if needed , a temporary Secretary appointed by the permanent Secretary. The student alleged to have violated the Honor Code. The two investigators assigned to the case. Relevant witnesses who may be present only while testifying. The faculty advisor selected by the accused. This individual is not permitted to testify, ask questions, or to make statements of any nature. 3. The Secretary or his/her appointee will take minutes of the hearing and make them available to the Honor Council. Decisions and Penalties A. For a student to be found responsible of an Honor Code violation, the unanimous vote of the seven voting members of the Honor Council is required [the Chair (or Vice -Chair) is not eligible to vote]. For all cases, the standard that shall be used to determine wh ether a violation was committed is \"preponderance of the evidence\", i.e., it is more likely than not that a violation of the Honor Code occurred. 70 B. If a student is found to have violated the Honor Code, the hearing panel will make a recommendation to the EAD for a sanction. The hearing panel will make the decision on the sanction by majority vote of the voting members of the Honor Council. In case of a tie, the Chair (or Vice -Chair) will cast a vote. C. The HC Liaison and EAD will be informed of the decision of the hearing panel and recommendation for sanction, where applicable, promptly following the decision of the hearing panel. D. The HC Liaison or EAD will only notify the Program Director of the student alleged to have violated the Honor Code of the outcome o f the hearing if the student is found responsible for a violation of the Honor Code and a sanction is recommended. E. Recommended sanctions for violations of the Honor Code. 1. The standard sanction for violation of the Honor Code is (a) a mandatory leave of absence from Emory University School of Medicine for at least one academic term (semester); and (b) a grade of \"Incomplete\" for all courses in which the student is enrolled at the time of the infraction. 2. The Honor Council may recommend to the EAD a penalty more severe than a mandatory leave of absence (e.g., permanent expulsion) or may recommend a less severe penalty (e.g., disciplinary probation for Honor Code violation), dependent upon the circumstances of the case. 3. Upon receipt of a mandatory leave of abs ence, the student cannot advance to the next term until he/she has completed the term in which the \"Incomplete\" grades were given. 4. A student on a mandatory leave of absence may enroll on graduate resident status. F. Decision of the Executive Associate Dean o f the School of Medicine The final decision on responsibility and the sanction rests with the EAD. The decision of the EAD will be effective immediately, unless there is an appeal to the dean. The appeal, including the basis for the appeal, must be submitt ed by the student in writing to the Dean within one week after the student is notified by the EAD of the decision. If a student files an appeal, the EAD will appoint an ad hoc committee consisting of three faculty members from the School of Medicine. The EAD will provide the committee with the information reviewed by the hearing panel, the minutes of the hearing, and the student's appeal. The committee will then make a recommendation to the Dean that the decision of the appeal committee be affirmed or rema nded to a new hearing panel. The Dean will then review that recommendation and make the final decision in the matter. Amendments to the Honor Code Amendments to the Honor Code may be proposed by the Honor Council at any point in the academic year; proposed amendments must be reviewed by Emory School of Medicine General Counsel and approved by the EAD before becoming effective. If an amendment is appr oved while a case is under active review that amendment will not apply to that case. Any new amendment, once approved, will 71 become effective as soon as all academic health professions' students have been notified of the change via mail or email. 72 DIVISION OF PHYSICAL THERAPY EMORY UNIVERSITY Learner Success Journey: Developing Habits of the Head, Heart, and Hand As you are aware, the journey to becoming a Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) is a challenging one that you, your peers, and the faculty will be traveling together. The faculty is committed to fostering your success in developing the attributes you need to be a master adaptive learner practicing physical therapy in a complex healthcare environment. The program is designed to provide learning opportunities necessary to develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes to become a competent physical therapist. The following policies and procedures will guide faculty and students in understanding and navigating academic p rogression and competence in didactic, clinical, and professional learning. What do we mean by habits of the head, heart and hand? It is our responsibility to prepare future physical therapists with knowledge (habits of the head), clinical skills (habits of the hand), and professional identity (habits of the heart) to serve our patients, communities, and profession. Part of this process is fostering a professional learner identity that is likely different than what most of you have experienced in your educ ation to this point. A master adaptive learner is a self -directed, reflective, adaptable, lifelong learner. Faculty will foster a learner's ability to recognize gaps in their knowledge or skills and seek out resources to fill them. They will need to be ref lective learners and able to self -assess, and to seek out and utilize feedback. Finally, these learners need to embrace the uncertainty of the learning and clinical environments so that they can respond and adapt flexibly and swiftly. Glossary of Academi c Status and Progression Terms: 1. Academic Status Designations and Pathways a. Satisfactory Progress A learner is demonstrating knowledge, clinical skills, and professional behavior competence as described in the Emory Division of Physical Therapy Competency and Criteria manual, meets the academic standards described below, and is following a typical progression through the program. b. Progression Risk A learner is experiencing significant issues related to knowledge, clinical skills, or professional behavior competence that have impacted their ability to follow a typical progression through the program. c. Relearning for Progression pathway (Progression Risk Status) Allows a student to repeat components of a course(s). This may require additional time beyond the semester, but if successful, will permit a typical progression through the program. 73 d. Modified Progression pathway (Progression Risk Status) Requires a student to significantly modify their progression through the program and will result in delaye d graduation. Requirements may include repeating courses or clinical experiences, auditing courses, reflection and self -assessment, independent study, etc. e. Dismissal: A learner may be dismissed when having knowledge, clinical skills, or professional behav ior issues that cannot be successfully rectified to allow for continued progression in the DPT program. 2. Academic Affairs Committee The Academic Affairs Committee is a DPT faculty committee which monitors student performance and progression. It provides co unsel to students and faculty when faced with learner performance challenges and makes recommendations regarding a learner's Academic Status or Progression Designation. The committee provides a mechanism for open, honest, and fair communication, and shared decision -making. See Academic Affairs Committee policies and procedures on page 76: Grading and Promotion: Learner success and academic progress are based on student competence in knowledge, psychomotor skills, and professional behaviors in the classroom, clinic, and community. DPT Program Completion Requirements : To successfully complete the Emory DPT progra m students must: 1) Hold the Academic Status of Satisfactory Progress at graduation. 2) Complete all program courses with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. 3) Successfully complete: 9 semesters of residential coursework 36 weeks of full -time clinical education exper ience 4) Demonstrate competence, as outlined in the Emory Division of Physical Therapy Competency and Criteria manual, for courses in the curricular sequence. The program uses the following criterion -based system to determine course grades and component (knowledge, psychomotor, professional behaviors) scores. 90-100% A: Grade point 4.0 80-89% Grade point 3.0 70-79% C: Grade point 2.0 60-69% D: Grade point 1.0 59% or below F: Grade point 0.0 74 Your cumulative GPA is the average GPA for all completed program coursework, and the semester GPA is the average GPA for an individual semester. Academic Status Standards and Designations: 1. Satisfactory Progress A learner achieves this status by demonstra ting competencies described in the Emory Division of Physical Therapy Competency and Criteria manual, as well as meeting the criteria described below: a. Maintain professional behaviors in the classroom, clinic, and community. b. Earn a minimum cumulative progra m GPA of 3.0 c. Earn a minimum semester GPA of 3.0 d. Earn a grade of B or above in each individual course. e. Successfully complete clinical courses including Fundamentals of Measurement (DPT 710), Introduction to Therapeutic Interventions (DPT 740), General M edical Conditions (DPT 755), Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation (DPT 800), Pediatric Rehabilitation (DPT 815) and Adult Neurorehabilitation (DPT 810). Criteria are as follows: i. Demonstrate competence in safety on ALL practical examinations. ii. Achieve a minimum sc ore of 80% on ALL practical examinations. iii. If a student scores below 80% or does not demonstrate competence in safety on a practical examination, the course instructor(s) MAY offer the student a retest (this is a second opportunity to successfully complete this examination). If the student does not successfully complete the retest, the student cannot pass the course and at that point is referred to Academic Affairs. iv. Attain a minimum cumulative average of 80% on written examinations within General Medical C onditions (DPT 755), Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation (DPT 800), Pediatric Rehabilitation (DPT 815) and Adult Neurorehabilitation (DPT 810). f. Successfully complete each Integrated Clinical Experience (ICE) and Terminal Clinical Experience (TCE). Criteria are as follows: i. ICE Requirements: The l earner is not required to achieve a minimum score for each ICE. The learner is expected to demonstrate developing competence , as assessed by the clinical instructor (CI), in the following: provision of patient care, interpersonal communication, teaching -learning, and administrative practice. The ICE score contributes 5% to the associated course grade for General Medical Conditions (GMC), Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation (MSK), and Adult Neurorehabilitation (Neuro). ii. TCE Requirements : The learners must receive a final score of: i. At least 80% in each of the four competencies: provision of patient care, interpersonal skills, teaching -learning skills, and administrative practice ii. At least 80% for question #7 Exami nation Items iii. At least 80% for question #13 Therapeutic Interventions iv. 100% for #16 Safety v. 100% for #40 Professionalism 75 2. Progression Risk A learner is designated in this status when experiencing significant issues that have impacted their ability to follow a typical progression through the program. This level is initiated when a learner: a. Has a cumulative GPA below 3.0. b. Achieved a semester GPA below 3.0 for the most recent semester. c. Earned less than 80% in any course. d. Did not achieve a minimum average of 80% on the written exams in clinical courses: General Medical Conditions (DPT 755), Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation (DPT 800), Pediatric Rehabilitation (DPT 815) and Adult Neurorehabilitation (DPT 810). e. Did not achieve 80% or higher on the practical exams in c linical courses: Fundamentals of Measurement (DPT 710), Introduction to Therapeutic Interventions (DPT 740), General Medical Conditions (DPT 755), Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation (DPT 800), and Adult Neurorehabilitation (DPT 810) f. Did not successfully comple te an ICE or TCE. g. Demonstrates lack of competency in professionalism in the classroom, clinic, or community. A student who is identified as Progression Risk will be placed in one of the following pathways: a. Relearning for Progression: This path allows a student to repeat components of a course(s) to achieve competence. A learner may require additional time beyond the end of the semester, but once competency is achieved, the student may continue a typical pro gression in the program. Academic Affairs will consult with course faculty and the student to determine key elements of an Individual Learning Success Plan (ILSP). b. Modified Progression: This path requires a student to significantly modify their progression in the program and will result in a delayed graduation. This academic standing may include repeating courses or clinical experiences, auditing courses, self -reflection and assessment, i ndependent study, etc. 3. Dismissal This academic standing results in the student not being allowed to continue in the DPT program due to academic deficiencies (knowledge, psychomotor skills, professional behavior) in any learning environment (classroom, cl inic, community) which cannot be successfully rectified. The following criteria are used by the Academic Affairs Committee, in consultation with course faculty, to determine whether the student should be considered for Dismissal: a. Not successfully completin g elements of an ILSP while on a \"Relearning for Progression\" or \"Modified Progression\" path. b. Committing a professionalism violation considered to be gross negligence or inappropriate behavior. 76 Academic Affairs Committee Policies and Procedures Purpose The Academic Affairs Committee: 1. Monitors learner success to ensure they are performing and progressing through the curriculum at an acceptable level for knowledge, clinical skills, and professional behaviors. 2. Makes recommendations to the faculty regarding learner academic standing and p rogress. 3. Sets policies and procedures pertaining to learner success, learner designations, and learning plans in consultation with the Director of the DPT Program and the Associate Director of Student and Faculty Affairs. 4. Serves as the advisory review co mmittee in cases of presumed discrepancies in criminal background checks and drug tests. Philosophy The Academic Affairs committee supports the learner success philosophy by working with students and faculty to identify and resolve academic issues, whic h includes knowledge, clinical skills, and professional behaviors in all courses, including clinical education experiences. The committee provides a mechanism for safe, open, honest, and fair communication, and collaborative decision -making by learners and faculty. Structure The Academic Affairs Committee is comprised of a Chair, Co -Chair and four faculty members, appointed by the Director of the DPT Program. A quorum of at least four members, including one of the Chairs, is required for an Academic Affairs meeting. Consultative Roles 1. A liaison(s) from the student Academic Affairs Committee may request a meeting with the Chair of the faculty Academic Affairs Committee to discuss academic concerns of the cohort. 2. A student may request a meetin g with the Chair of the faculty Academic Affairs Committee to discuss individual academic or professional concerns. 3. An entire cohort may request a meeting with the Chair of the faculty Academic Affairs Committee to discuss academic concerns. The request sh ould be accompanied by suggested meeting times and an agenda. 4. The Chair of the faculty Academic Affairs Committee, alone or with faculty, may request a meeting with specific students, or the cohort, to discuss any academic concerns. The request should be accompanied by suggested meeting times and an agenda. 77 Academic Progression Process 1. Satisfactory Academic Progress a. Based on grades submitted to the registrar at the end of the semester, the Academic Affairs committee will approve the progression for students making satisfactory academic progress. 2. Progression Risk a. The student and relevant faculty will be invited to mee t with the committee. Prior to attending the meeting, the student will be expected to self -reflect on their issues, formulate strategies for improvement, and identify available resources. b. The Academic Affairs Committee will make their determination of the appropriate pathway for progression (Relearning for Progression or Modified Progression). i. If the committee determines the appropriate pathway to be Relearning for Progression , it must be approved by a majority vote of the Academic Affairs committee. ii. If the committee determines the appropriate pathway to be Modified Progression , it will send its recommendation to the entire faculty. Approval is achieved by a majority vote of the faculty. c. The student will be notified by email of the decision of the Academic A ffairs meeting or Faculty vote. The letter outlining the decision, options, and requirements will be sent by the Director of the DPT program and the Chair of the Academic Affairs Committee. d. After receiving the emailed letter notifying the student that thei r academic standing is Progression Risk: Relearn for Progression or Modified Progression , they must sign and return the letter within 5 business days. The signature acknowledges acceptance of their academic standing and pathway. e. The Academic Affairs Commit tee, course faculty, and student will collaborate to develop an Individual Learning Success Plan (ILSP) which will serve to guide the student through the learning process to assist the student in regaining satisfactory academic progress. The ILSP will be d eveloped and signed by the student, course faculty, and the Chair of the Academic Affairs Committee. f. Following successful completion of the Relearning for Progression ILSP, the highest course grade that can be earned is a B (80%). g. While participating in a Modified Progression ILSP, a student who successfully repeats a course for a grade is eligible to earn an A in that course. h. If the student does not successfully complete a course while on a Relear ning for Progression, they will meet with Academic Affairs to determine if they will be offered a Modified Progression or a Dismissal . i. If the student does not successfully complete a course while on a Modified Progression , they will meet with Academic Affair s to discuss any extenuating circumstances that would prevent them from being dismissed from the program. 78 j. A student is only allowed to retake one course per se mester on a Relearning for Progression path . k. A student is only allowed to participate in a Relearning for Progression path four times during the entire program. This translates to only repeating a total of four courses during the program . l. If a student participates in a Modified Progression , the cumulative total for \"Relear ning for Progression\" opportunities will re -start at zero. 3. Dismissal a. If the Academic Affairs Committee recommends Dismissal , the entire faculty will be informed of the recommendation. Approval of the recommendation requires a majority vote of the faculty. b. The st udent will be notified by email of the Academic Affairs decision as soon as possible after the Faculty vote. A letter outlining the decision will be sent to the student by the Director of the DPT program and the Chair of the Academic Affairs Committee. c. Within 5 business days (unless there are extenuating circumstances) of receiving the emailed letter notifying the student that their academic standing is Dismissal , the student must sign and return the letter acknowledging the academic standing decision. The Process to Appeal an Academic Progression Path A student is permitted to appeal a decision by the faculty, the Academic Affairs Committee and/or the Director of the Division of Physical Therapy. It should be noted that all appeals should be conducted in a professional manner, and the student should provide objective, substantive support for their position. Failure to exhibit appropriate professional attitudes may terminate the appeal process. Appealing a Modified Progression 1. To appeal a \"Modified Progression\" decision, the student must submit a formal appeal in writing to the Director of the Division of Physical Therapy within 5 business days of receipt of the notification letter. a. The appeal must be based on the following gro unds: i. Submission of information or facts not previously known, which would be sufficient to alter the decision. ii. Allegations of a procedural error which may have substantially impacted the fairness of the decision. 2. The student may consult with the Director of the DPT Program and the Chair of the Academic Affairs Committee or other faculty members when drafting an appeal letter for guidance. 3. The appeal will be reviewed and voted on by the DPT Faculty. A majority vote is necessary for approval of the appeal. 79 4. The student will be notified of the faculty decision via a letter from the Director of the DPT program and the Chair of Academic Affairs within 5 business days of the vote. Appealing a Dismissal 1. To appeal a dismissal decision, the student must send a form al appeal in writing to the Director of the Division of Physical Therapy within 5 business days of notification of dismissal. 2. The student may consult with the Director of the DPT Program and Chair of the Academic Affairs Committee or other faculty members when drafting an appeal letter. 3. The appeal will be submitted to the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education. The Director will provide the Dean with relevant documentation including the Academic Affairs recommendation, and the decision letter sent to the student. 4. The Executive Associate Dean will convene an ad -hoc review panel of SOM faculty members to consider the appeal and meet with the student, faculty, and/or the Director of the DPT program. 5. The ad -hoc review panel will make a recommendation to the Executive Associate Dean. 6. The Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education shall make the final decision on the appeal and will notify the student in writing. All appeal decisions are final. Grievance Process and Grade Appeals for Individual Courses 1. If a learner has concerns about the fairness and/or validity of the content or process of a course, the following steps should be taken: a. Consult with the course instructor(s). The learner should clearly and objectively present their concerns and feasible solutions. b. If consultation with the instructor proves unsatisfactory, the learner should confer with the Chair of the faculty Academic Affairs Committee. In collaboration with the learner and instructor, the Chair will act as mediator to create a reasonable solution. 2. To appeal a course grade, the student should follow the steps outlined in #1 above. If the solution created in #1b is not acceptable, the student must submit a written statement to the Chair of the faculty Academic Affairs Committee . The Chair will convene an Academic Affairs meeting to make recommendations to the faculty for a final decision. 3. If the final decision of the faculty, in instances of #2 and #3, above, is unsatisfactory to the student, School of Medicine appeal mechanisms are available. Information will be provided upon written request from the Chair of the faculty Academic Affairs Committee . 80 POLICY ON EXAMINATION PROCEDURES The following procedures are to be observed by faculty and students during the administration of examinations. These procedures were adopted with guidance from The Federation of State Boards of Physical Therapy's and Prometric Testing Center's testing poli cies, to protect both the individual student and the integrity of the examination. 1. All students are expected to take the examination on the scheduled day. The instructor has no obligation to provide alternate arrangements, if you are unable to take the ex amination on the scheduled day. 2. All examinations are monitored. 3. We do not routinely give take -home examinations. Group examinations are not given. 4.

Students are not allowed to make copies of examination and exa mination keys. 82 Review of Course Examinations Examination review processes are determined by course faculty. An example of an examination review process is provided below. Examination Review Policy in Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation : Students will have the opportunity to review the results of their examinations during the semester. The purpose of the examination review is to identify patterns of content deficiencies. The course coordinator(s) will id entify blocks of time throughout the semester so that students are able to review their examinations in a small group format or individually. If a student wishes to review the examination individually, a formal request must be made to the course faculty to schedule an appointment. The location, duration and frequency of the examination review sessions are at the discretion of the course coordinator(s). Every attempt will be made to schedule examination reviews within two weeks after an exam grade is posted. Examination reviews Optional attendance, dates posted on MSK schedule 1-time review of each exam Students are responsible to seek out faculty assistance via email or in person if score is <80 on any didactic evaluation. A faculty member, graduate assistant, course preceptor, or teaching assistant will be appointed by the course coordinator(s) to oversee all exam review sessions. Students may not attempt to duplicate or distribute test items by writing items down, taking photographs of them , attempting to save them to a personal device, or any other such activities. Students are not permitted to take a break from the exam review session. They must remain in the room until the time limit has expired or they have finished their review. Concern s about examination test items should be raised during office hours with a faculty member/instructor within the respective course. 83 DIVISION OF PHYSICAL THERAPY EMORY UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC DEFICIENCY AND ACADEMIC PROBATION Following are two forms that are used by the Division of Physical Therapy. The first entitled Record of Academic Deficiency Counseling is used any time a student is counseled about his performance. The execution of the form by the faculty advisor will establish that the student has been warned about substandard work. The form is used to advise the student of some academic deficiency wh ich could lead to academic probation or dismissal. Written recommendations for correction of the deficiency are also provided. There will be two copies of the document. The student gets one copy, and the program retains a copy in the student's file. The second form, Record of Academic Probation Recommendation , is used when a student fails to achieve a grade of B or above in all Division of Physical Therapy courses or unsatisfactory completion of a special project and/or practicum. There will be two copies of the probation form. The student receives one copy and one copy is retained in the student's file . The forms are designed to provide the student with written documentation of feedback and are for the protection of both student and faculty. 84 Emory University Division of Physical Therapy RECORD OF ACADEMIC DEFICIENCY COUNSELING Student Name : Faculty : Program: DPT Course: Nature of Deficiency: Recommendation(s) made to student: The student acknowledges that he/she has experienced some academic problems that jeopardize good standing in the program and that failure to correct the deficiency(ies) can lead to placement on academic probation and/or academic dismissal from the program. Faculty signature ________________________ Date ________________________ Student signature ________________________ Date ________________________ 85 Emory University Division of Physical Therapy RECORD OF ACADEMIC PROBATION RECOMMENDATION Student Name : Faculty : Program: DPT Course: Date Probation to be Effective Nature of Deficiency: Requirement for continuation: The student acknowledges that the student is being recommended to the Dean of the School of Medicine for placement on Academic Probation. Upon approval of this recommendation by the Dean, the student understands that failure to meet the requirements for continuation stated above will result in academic dismissal from the School of Medicine. Faculty signatu re ________________________ Date ________________________ Student signature ________________________ Date ________________________ 86 DIVISION OF PHYSICAL THERAPY EMORY UNIVERSITY Evaluation of Student Classroom Participation In all classes, a percentage of your grade is based on classroom participation and professional behavior (including dress). 1. Answers questions during discussion of assigned or presented material The above behavior demonstrates recall, comprehension and/or application of information obtained from assigned readings or experiences. The behavior may be voluntary or solicited. Correctness of the response(s) is not a factor here; rather, the student's willingness to giv e the response. 2. Asks questions directly related to assigned material This behavior demonstrates the student's recognition of his/her lack of understanding or need for clarification. 3. Asks questions extrapolated from assigned/presented material In this situation, the student demonstrates adequate comprehension of material to generate related questions. The questions do not deal with information presented in the material, per se. Instead the questions hypothesize relationships of the material with other concepts or situations in which principles may apply. In addition, the questions may be seeking additional pertinent information recognized as relevant by the student. 4. Reports on an assigned project The student voluntarily presents information on a project assigned to the class as a whole or to an individual student. The behavior indicates willingness to share information and to participate. 5. Presents information from voluntary additional reading, project, etc. The student voluntarily presents information related to the discussion topic. The information has been obtained from an additional reading source or a project independently undertaken by the student. 6. Praises or challenges the contribution of some member of the gr oup The above behaviors indicate the student's interest and willingness to participate in discussion. The response may support the relevance, insight or meaningfulness of a comment by the student or teacher. On the other hand, the response may express c uriosity regarding the correctness or relevance of a comment. Challenges should demonstrate openness and interest rather t han condescension or judgement. 87 7. Contributes pertinent information from past experiences The student presents a brief account of a previous clinical or personal experience which serves as an example of a situation under discussion, of application of principles or concepts being discussed, or an alternative method of administering a technique, etc. 8. Contributes suggestions regardi ng hypotheses, methods, solutions for a problem, project, etc. The behavior stated above relates specifically to new, novel and different situations rather than contributions from past experiences or reproduced from assignments. These contributions indic ate interest in the topic area and classroom activity plus potential ability to analyze situations and synthesize information. 9. Attends to classroom activity This item relates to non -verbal behavior reflecting attention on the part of the student. Exa mples include maintaining eye contact with persons speaking, taking notes and facial and postural expressions supportive of the group activity. 10. Works toward completion of tasks assigned during the class session Again, this behavior is primarily non -verbal. Examples of class sessions in which this behavior is appropriate include labs, classes with small group work, etc. Evidence of the behavior is simply seeing the student engage in activities consistent with the objectives or assignments for the lea rning experience. 11. Supports the classroom environment by appropriate dress The behavior stated above addresses adherence to the dress code when attending any type of class. There are specific guidelines for dress for seminars, laboratories, and classe s with guest speakers. The guidelines also specify the appropriate dress for clinical and other types of settings. Evidence of the above behavior is observation of student dress to determine compliance with guidelines. 12. Attends Class Attends the scheduled class session. If the student cannot attend, the student communicates with the instructor prior to class, if possible. The student arrives for class at the scheduled time. Also, the student returns from breaks at the scheduled time. 13. Course Evaluations Students are required to fill out course and instructor evaluations for every course. The evaluation forms are sent electronically two weeks prior to the end of the semester and remain open for two weeks after the end of the semester. Obtaining feedback is extremely important to the development and continued e xcellence of the program and of the faculty. It is also an opportunity for students to practice providing constructive feedback. You must complete the evaluations in order to get your final grade for the course and in order to graduate . 88 EXAMPLE OF EVALUATION OF STUDENT CLASSROOM PERFORMANCE Student: ________________________ Instructor: _________________________ Instructions : Space has been provided for the name of the student and the date.

Therefore, the faculty discourages outside employment that may interfere with academic performance. Should students decide to assume volunteer activities (unaffiliated with Emory DPT) or employment that involves assisting with the care of individual(s) in their hom es, students are personally responsible for abiding by all practice laws and guidelines, including refraining from activities that can't be performed without a professional license . Emory is not responsible for any liabilities associated with these outside volunteer or employment activities. Conflict of Interest Policy The primary intent of this policy is to help faculty, staff, students, and trainees effectively report and address potential conflicts of interest and commitment in their professional activities. Once reported, the individual and the School and University can work together to enhance the beneficial outcomes of principled personal external professional relationships to the institution and the public and prevent even the appe arance of undue influence that might harm the public, the institution, or the individual. Policies that address relationships between all members of the Emory Community (faculty, students, and staff) and can be found in their entirety at the following web address: https://inside.med.emory.edu/administration/industry_relations/index.html Emory Students : a. May N ot accept gifts from industry, on or off the Emory campus (pens, pads, cash, food and drink, entertainment, books, software, etc.). Travel expenses are also considered a gift, and therefore prohibited. b. May Not accept donations of medications. c. May b e part of interactions between industry representatives and faculty that concern research being done by the faculty member and industry, as long as the meeting does not include sales, marketing, or promotion. d. Must not disclose information regarding clinical trials of med ical devices or drugs to any outside entity. e. Must not provide advice or training to industry regarding selling, marketing, or promoting of a company's products. f. May not receive remuneration for listening to sales talks or attending in dustry sponsored education and training. g. Must cooperate with inquiries from Emory administrative offices regarding compliance with these policies. 91 h. Submit proposals for personal, external professional relationships with industry and other entities to the Dean for review and approval prior to engaging or receiving compensation for the activities. Additional regulations in this policy include: a. Commercial Exhibits are prohibited i n School of Medicine Buildings. b. Any book or educational material that is recomm ended b y a faculty member who has a financial interest in the book or material must be approved by a committee formed by the faculty member's chair. c. Faculty presentations to medical students and residents shoul d disclose all their personal, professional fi nancial relationships with industry in each presentation. Any violation of this policy by a student will be considered unprofessional behavior and will subject the student to actions by the appropriate Progress and Promotions Committee or by a Conduct Committee appointed by the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs. Student Consents and Releases Students must release certain information, including specific protected health information (PHI), to the Division of phys ical Therapy and allow the Division to provide this information to Emory facilities and to any outside institution that requests verification of immunization status prior to participation in any required, elective or voluntary clinical experience related t o medical training at the Division. Students must allow the Division of Physical Therapy to release information to other departments of the University, such as Student Health Services and the Office of Financial Aid, in order to verify or certify services , scholarship eligibility, or other items necessary for the continuation of enrollment and to meet all state and federal health and safety requirements. All students must also give their consent to be photographed and recorded. Many of the clinical and pr ofessional skills assessments require that faculty and students view recordings of their assessments together. If a student should refuse to provide or revoke any of these consents or releases, the student should understand that such action might affect th e student's ability to meet the requirements for the degree and eligibility to graduate and participate in the clinical experiences. These consents and releases must be provided by the student upon matriculation and will remain in effect throughout the student's enrollment or until such time as consent is revoked, in writing, by the student. 92 SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY Each student is responsible for his or her postings on the Internet and in social media. In all communications, students are expe cted to be courteous, respectful, and considerate of others. Inappropriate postings on the Internet or social media will be considered lapses in the standards of professionalism expected of Emory students. Students responsible for such postings are subject to the conduct code process as for other unprofessional behavior that occurs outside the academic setting and may face disciplinary actions including dismissal from the School of Medicine. Students within the School of Medicine are urged to consider the following before posting any comments, videos, pictures, or essays to the Internet or a social media site: a. There is no such thing as an \"anonymous\" post. Furthermore, any posts or comments submitted for others to read should be posted with ful l identification. Where your connection to Emory is apparent, make it clear that you are speaking for yourself and not on behalf of Emory. A disclaimer, such as, \"The views expressed on this [blog or website] are my own and do not reflect the views of my U niversity or the School of Medicine\" is required. b. Internet activities may be permanently linked to the author. All future employment may be hampered by inappropriate behavior on the Internet. c. Making postings \"private\" does not preclude others copying and p asting comments on public websites. \"Private\" postings that become public are subject to sanctions described in the School of Medicine Conduct Code. d. Do not share information in violation of any laws or regulations ( i.e. HIPAA). Disclosing information about patients without written permission of the patient and the School of Medicine, including photographs or potentially identifiable information is strictly prohibited. This rule also applies to deceased patients. e. For Emory's protection as well as your own, i t is critical that you show proper respect for the laws governing intellectual property, copyright and fair use of copyrighted material owned by others, including Emory's own copyrights and brands. Curricular materials developed by Emory faculty and staff, or faculty/staff of other medical schools or educational institutions should not be distributed or redistributed. When in doubt, students should seek guidance regarding appropriate use of such materials. f. Do not share confidential or proprietary informatio n that may compromise Emory's research efforts, business practices or security. 93 Social Media Guidelines for Social Networking * Adapted from Social Media Guidelines for the American Medical Student Association (AMSA). As students and medical provide rs, we should represent our profession well. Always adhere to rules of ethical and professional conduct. Be responsible. Carefully consider content and exercise good judgment as anything you post can have immediate and/or long - term consequences and carry the potential for significant public impact and viral spread of content. Therefore, all statements must be true and not misleading. Make sure that you differentiate opinions from facts. Maintain separation. Avoid interacting with current or past patients through social media and avoid requests to give medical advice through social media. Be transparent/use disclaimers. Disclose yourself and provide an appropriate disclaimer that distinguishes your views from those of the clinic, hospital system and/or university with which you are associated (while at the same time, being careful not to violate any social media policy to which you may be subject by such organizations). Without specific direction from the appropriate personnel, you may not present yourself as an official representative or spokesperson for said organizations. Also, be sure to reveal any conflicts of interest and be honest about your credentials as a student or medical provider. Be respectful. Do not use defamatory, vulgar, libelous, and potentially inflammatory language and do not display language or photographs that imply disrespect for any individual or gro up because of age, race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, marital status, genetic information, military status, or any other protected characterization or group. Follow copyright laws. Comply with copyright laws. Make sure you have the right to use material before publishing. Protect client/patient information. Do not discuss confidential information and follow standards of patient privacy and confidentiality and regulations outlined in Health Insurance Portability and Accountabilit y Act (HIPAA) and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232g). Remember you could personally face a HIPAA violation if there are enough details in the post for patients to recognize themselves. Avoid political endorsements. Political endorsements of candidates should be avoided outside your own personal social media accounts, even their comments should be carefully considered. 94 Comply with all legal restrictions and obligations. Remember use of social networking sites or weblog s can carry legal and professional ramifications. Comments made in an unprofessional manner can be used in legal, professional, or other disciplinary proceedings (i.e., hearings before a State Medical Licensing Board). Be aware of risks to privacy and security. Read the site's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Be cognizant of continuous changes in these sites and closely monitor the privacy settings of the social network accounts to optimize your privacy and security Ref: https://www.med.emory.edu/handbook/professional -conduct/expectations/social - media.html 95 GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES -STUDENT COMPLAINTS OF DISCRIMINATION Overview Emory is committed to the values of respect, civility, and community as set forth in the Statement of Ethical Principles. In addition to being unlawful, sexual and discriminatory harassment interfe re with the University's educational mission and the practice of community. Individuals who believe that they have experienced or witnessed acts of discrimination or discriminatory harassment may seek resolution through several pathways. Any or all of the following steps may be pursued in resolving an incident of alleged discrimination or harassment. Applicability Emory University is committed to receiving and addressing written student complaints against the university, its faculty, staff, or administrati ve personnel in a timely manner. Appropriate procedures are described below and should be adhered to in response to student complaints. Students should first attempt to resolve their complaints with the office most directly responsible for the action being challenged. Each school at Emory has an office of Student Services that can further assist students and direct them within their specific school if they are uncertain about where to start. In addition, students may use the ombudsperson https://ombuds.emory.edu/services.html to assist with complaints if they are uncertain or wish to discuss a situation confidentially before taking more formal action. Federal financial aid laws and regulations require that each state has a process to review an d act on complaints concerning educational institutions in the state. You may file a complaint about Emory University with the State of Georgia Office of Inspector General by following the directions at the OIG website. In the event that OIG receives a stu dent complaint relating to financial aid, it will forward it to the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Education. Applicability This policy applies to current and former students who choose to make a formal written complaint against the university, its faculty, staff, or administrative personnel. Policy Details Documentation of Complaint Student complaints must be submitted in writing and accompanied by relevant documentation describing 1) the specific action, practice or decision that is being challenged, 2) the individuals involved in or with knowledge of the action, practice or decision at issue, 3) the impact of the decision, 4) what resolution is desired, and 5) why it should be granted. 96 Complaint Resolution Except in situation s involving allegations of discrimination or harassment (where students may file complaints directly with the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs), Emory encourages each student to pursue complaints against faculty, staff or administrative personnel at th e school or department level. Each school has its own procedures as described in the student handbook or schools catalog. Academic or other concerns usually begin with student service personnel in each school who then typically route the concerns to the ap propriate school authority. Student concerns can be effectively handled by school personnel who have expertise in the academic discipline involved, familiarity with the faculty/staff, and who have experience in handling similar school decisions made regard ing its students. To expedite a prompt resolution, complaints should include current contact information of the individual filing the complaint. In most cases, responses to the complaint, including the final decision, will be provided in writing within 30 days of receipt of the complaint. However, exceptions to this timeframe may be allowed with reasonable and regular communication to inform the student of the current status of the complaint. Record Retention The designated school or department representati ve for reporting purposes should retain the written complaint along with the resolution of the complaint, and any additional supporting documentation including emails, or other communication. In addition, an action log of all complaints received should be maintained each year. This action log is collected by the Office of Institutional Research, Planning and Effectiveness as a part of the Annual Report process. State of Georgia Federal financial aid laws and regulations require that each state has a proces s to review and act on complaints concerning educational institutions in the state. If you have a complaint, you may file it with Emory's financial aid office or call the Trust Line at 1 -888-550-8850 or file a report online at http://iad.emory.edu/compliance/trustline/index.html .You may also file a complaint about Emory University with the State of Georgia Office of Inspector General by following the directions at the OIG https://oig.georgia.gov/ . In the event that OIG receive s a student complaint relating to financial aid, it will forward it to the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Education. Definitions A complaint is a written description of a problem or concern. A student may contact the Office of Divers ity, Equity and Inclusion for complaints in the areas of Academic, Non -academic, Discrimination/Harassment ( http://equityandinclusion.emory.edu/index.html ), or for appeals of any of the previously mentioned areas. If a student has a complaint involving dis crimination, harassment or sexual misconduct against an Emory employee, the complaint can be made directly to the Office of Diversity , Equity and 97 Inclusion Otherwise, a complaint should be filed with and handled by the relevant school or department. The \"handling official \" is the person designated in each school or department to address the complaint. An ombudsperson is an individual to whom students may speak regarding a problem, conflict or concern. The Ombudsperson offers assistance through informal mea ns only, and is not an advocate in grievance procedures, judicial procedures or any other formal process.

Please understand that, while this method of resolution may be successful in solving the immediate problem, Emory will be unaware of the problem and thus unable to take any additional steps that might be necessary to address broader concerns. Individuals who choose not to address the alleged harasser directly, or who have not obtained a satisfactory resolution following such a discussion, are encouraged to utilize one of the other methods outlined below for addressing their concerns. If at any point in this process, the complainant determines that this method of reso lution is unsatisfactory, the student has every right to file an internal complaint with EOP or an external complaint with EEOC. The Respondent also has the right to refuse to participate in the Community Facilitator process. 98 File an internal complaint If a student believes that he or she has been the victim of discrimination or discriminatory harassment, he or she may promptly report, without fear of reprisal, the facts of the incident and the name(s) of the individual(s) involved to the Offi ce of Equity and Inclusion (OEI) located in Suite 305 of the Administration Building. Alternatively, a student may report the situation to his or her immediate supervisor, department or division head, or Dean, who will immediately notify OEI of the complai nt. Supervisors must immediately report any complaints they receive or incidents of alleged harassment or discrimination they witness to a member of the Office of Equi ty and Inclusion . However, if the complaint relates to a member of the Office of Equity a nd Inclusion, the complaint should be directed to the Supervisor of the Director of the Office of Equity and Inclusion, who shall appoint an appropriate investigator. The Office of Equity and Inclusion ( OEI) ( or an alternate investigator, where appropriate ) will investigate all timely claims of harassment and discrimination, regardless of whether such complaints are reduced to writing. All complaints of discrimination and harassment will be treated in the strictest confidence possible under the particular c ircumstances. All complaints of discrimination or harassment should be filed as soon after the offending conduct as possible, but in no event more than 180 calendar days after the most recent conduct alleged to constitute discrimination or harassment. Emor y will not retaliate or take any adverse action against anyone for truthfully reporting conduct that he or she believes to be in violation of this Policy, or for participating in good faith in an investigation of alleged discrimination or harassment, or fo r participating in any proceeding or hearing relating to such complaints. Upon receipt of a complaint, the Director of the Office of Equity and Inclusion (or an appropriate alternate investigator) will assign an investigator who will, within forty -five (4 5) workdays , investigate the circumstances of the allegations. However, if additional time is needed to conduct a thorough investigation, OEI may, at its discretion, extend the time for completing the investigation as reasonably necessary. In this case, OE I will notify the complainant and the respondent of the extension. The investigation will include interviews with the complaining party, the Respondent, and any material witnesses identified, as well as a review of any documents or other evidence. The complaining party and the Respondent will be kept apprised of the conduct of the investigation and will be given the opportunity to provide any additional relevant information to the investigator, including the names of additional witnesses t o contact and/or additional documents to review before the investigation is closed. At any time before the conclusion of the investigation, the Dean or equivalent division head of the unit of the University to which the Respondent is assigned may take inte rim emergency action (not involving reduction of compensation) until the conclusion of the investigation. The final written determination will state only whether, based on The Office of Equity and Inclusion's investigation, there was a violation of this P olicy. The Complainant and Respondent will be promptly notified of the final determination. The Office of Equal Opportunity Programs shall have no independent authority to impose sanctions. If OEI finds that there has been a violation of this policy and if the Dean or division head seeks advice as to the appropriate penalty, OEI may provide a recommendation as to the appropriate sanction. The Dean or division head will then be responsible for deciding upon and imposing disciplinary action as soon as reasona bly possible, but no more than one month after receiving the final determination and 99 advice of EOP. The Dean or deciding official shall notify OEI of the penalty imposed, if any. Sanctions imposed on those employees who have been found to be in violation o f the University's Equal Opportunity Policy or its Discriminatory Harassment Policy shall be commensurate with the severity and/or frequency of the conduct, and shall be adequate and sufficient to prevent such conduct in the future. The sanctions may inclu de, but are not limited to, an apology to the victim; a verbal or written reprimand; a requirement to attend remedial training; appropriate workplace restrictions; denial of a merit pay increase or other benefit; denial of promotion; or reassignment, suspe nsion or separation from the University. Staff members who receive disciplinary penalties under this policy may consult Human Resources for information about the Grievance process, which may be used to challenge alleged violations, misinterpretations, or i nequitable application of policies or procedures. Issues Specific to Faculty If at any time during the investigation, a bona fide question arises out of a conflict between the principles of academic freedom and the requirements of this Policy, the Respon dent or The Office of Equity and Inclusion may request that the Provost or the designee to appoint a Faculty Review Panel to review the evidence and to provide advice to the OEI as to whether there was a violation of Policy. If the Provost agrees that the situation involves a bona fide conflict between the principles of academic freedom and the requirements of this Policy, the Provost shall appoint a Faculty Review Panel. The convening, investigation and recommendation of the Faculty Review Panel will be concurrent with the investigation of OEI. The Faculty Review Panel will consist of a group of 5 to 7 faculty members, 3 of whom are from the Respondent's school, who will be chosen by the Provost from among a pool of eligible faculty members who are electe d by University faculty. Once selected by the Provost, the Faculty Review Panel may question the Respondent, the Complainant, and any other witness necessary to adequately address the issue. The Faculty Review Panel may also review the OEI investigatory fi le and any other documentary evidence needed. The procedures shall be kept as confidential as possible so as to respect the rights of all involved parties. At the conclusion of its review, the Faculty Review Panel shall provide a recommendation to EOP as t o whether they believe that there was a violation of the Discriminatory Harassment Policy. OEI shall include the recommendation of the Faculty Review Panel in submitting the final report to the Dean. The Dean shall make the final decision as to what, if an y, sanctions may be appropriate under the circumstances. Following a determination of sanctions, faculty may avail themselves of avenues of appeal as listed in the Statement of Principles Governing Faculty Relationships. Specifically, a faculty member shal l be entitled to a hearing of the Faculty Hearing Committee when the sanction imposed by the Dean for violation of this Policy is the suspension, transfer, or termination of the individual's employment. File an External Complaint An individual who believ es that he or she has been subjected to unlawful discrimination, harassment, or retaliation has the right to file a complaint with an appropriate local, state, or federal agency, such as the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), within applicable time limits. In addition, any person who is dissatisfied with Emory's internal procedures utilized for handling complaints, or who is dissatisfied with the result of the investigation or the sanctions imposed, may seek redress through the EEOC, to the 100 extent allowed by law. The Complainant should be aware that filing a complaint with the University's Office of Equal Opportunity Programs or other University resource does not extend or postpone the deadline for filing with external agencies. In the event that a complaint is filed with an external agency or court, the University reserves the right to determine, in its discretion, whether the University's internal complaint resolution procedure should be discontinued or conti nued separately. OTHER Complaints Against Vendors, Contractors, and Third Parties Emory's commitment to providing members of its community with a working and learning environment that is free of discriminatory harassment includes freedom from inappropriate conduct by vendors, contractors, and third parties. If a member of the University community believes he or she has been subjected to harassing conduct by a vendor, contractor, or third party, he or she should report such conduct to the Office of Equity and Inclusion , to his or her immediate supervisor or Dean, or to a higher University official. Such complaints should be forwarded to the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs immediately. EOP will work with the complaining party to investigate the complaint, and the University will take prompt corrective action if inappropriate conduct is found to have occurred. Complaints Against Students Students are bound by the principles outlined in this policy. However, complaints against students (when acting in the capacity as a student) shall be resolved under the Conduct Code provided by that student's school or college (unless the student's school or college conduct code provides otherwise.) Investigation of complaints against students who are acting in the capacity of an employee shall be conducted by Equal Opportunity Programs, or a designee, who shall report the findings and recommendations to EOP and Dean for Campus Life and the Dean of the school or college in which the student is enrolled.

To better serve students, there are four new or updated aspects of the Student Mistreatment Reporting for all programs in the School of Medicine: (1) NEW student mistreatment algorithm that describes the decision tree for receiving, adjudicating, and communicating around student mistreatment reports. (2) NEW student mistreatment group (SMG) to analyze quarterly de -identified mistreatment data submitted through this algorithm, (3) UPDATED stud ent mistreatment form, and (4) UPDATED student mistreatment policy for ALL programs in the School of Medicine. Definition of Mistreatment: Mistreatment, either intentional or unintentional, occurs when behavior shows disrespect for the dignity of others and unreasonably interferes with the learning process. Scope of School of Medicine Student: Any student enrolled in active academic progr ams for Emory School of Medicine including MD, PA, DPT, GC, MI, and AA. 102 (1) NEW Algorithm for reporting student mistreatment and how it is handled (2) NEW Student Mistreatment Group (SMG) Purpose: The School of Medicine strives for an environment that is respectful of all community members and does not tolerate mistreatment of students. Mistreatment, either intentional or unintentional, occurs when behavior shows disrespect for the dignity of others and unreasonably interferes with the learning process. To this end, the School of Medicine SMG is convened to review the aggregate, deidentified data on reports of student mistreatment that occur in the learning environment and recommend actions to improve the student clinical learning experi ence. The SMG will include faculty and staff from Emory School of Medicine and representative of all programs. Student Mistreatment Policy https://med.emory.edu/education/programs/md/student - handbook/policies/som/mistreatment.html 103 Student Mistreatment fo r all School of Medicine Programs The School of Medicine strives for an environment that is respectful of all community members and does not tolerate mistreatment of students. Emory students are protected by two University Policies as stated in the followi ng two paragraphs. The University Equal Opportunity and Discriminatory Harassment Policy (Policy 1.3) is incorporated into this Policy. Per Policy 1.3, Emory encourages anyone who has knowledge of discrimination on campus to report alleged violations of Po licy 1.3 to the Emory University Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance . Emory faculty, administrators and supervisors are required to immediately rep ort any complaints they receive or incidents of discrimination or discriminatory harassment they witness, to their immediate report or to the Emory University Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance. Per the Emory University Sex and Gender -Based Hara ssment and Discrimination Policy (Policy 8.2) every university employee who is informed about an allegation of sexual misconduct involving any student is required to notify the Department of Title IX. In conjunction with the two University Policies listed above, the School of Medicine Student Mistreatment Policy addresses additional types of behavior that will not be tolerated. Mistreatment of students in the School of Medicine includes, but is not limited to, students: Being treated in a manner that a reasonable person would find belittling, humiliating insulting or disrespectful under the circumstances Being sexually harassed Being denied opportunities for training or rewards, or receiving lower evaluations or grades based on any prohibited consideration, including race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, genetic information, age, disability, sexual orientati on, gender identity, gender expression, veteran's status, or any factor that is a prohibited consideration under applicable law (referred to as \"prohibited considerations\") Being maliciously and intentionally left out of communications to the detriment of a student Being subjected (directly or indirectly) to offensive sexist, racist, or ethnically offensive remarks, advances or names Being required to perform inappropriate personal services (i.e., babysitting, shopping) Being threatened with phy sical harm (e.g., hit, slapped, kicked) Reporting Mistreatment Student mistreatment is contrary to the values, respect, civility, and community as set forth in the University's Statement of Ethical Principles. School of Medicine students who experience mistreatment themselves or observe other students experiencing possible mistreatment are expected and encouraged to follow the following reporting process. The initial step is for students to discuss the incident of mistreatment is to either confidentially report via the Student Mistreatment Form or talk to their Program Leader, the Deans, Academic Advisor, Career Counselor, or Small Group Advisor (SGA). 104 All reports of student mistreatment will be routed first to Dr. Christen Hairston, Associate Dean for Student Success, who will follow algorithm in Section 2. Prohibition of Retaliation The School of Medicine prohibits retaliation against a student who, in good faith, complains about or participates in an investigation of student mistreatment. Any student who feels they have been retaliated agains t or threatened with retaliation should report the allegation immediately to the Associate Dean of Student Success. The appropriate department related to the incident will investigate the alleged retaliation and make a report to the Executive Associate Dean for Medical Education and Student Affairs School of Medicine, when possible, within 30 days of the filing of the complaint. While mistreatment issues may be written in student evaluations of residents or faculty and evaluations of courses or clerkships, students should NOT rely on those mechanisms as the primary or sole means to report mistreatment. The reporting mechanisms described above have been established to produce a timely and effective resolution to any mistreatment concerns. If you have questio ns about student mistreatment, please reach out to Dr. Stacy Higgins (MD clinical), Dr. Christen Hairston (Student Success -All programs), or Dr. Douglas Ander (Health Science Programs). 105 Complaint s About an Academic PT Program Commission on Accreditation of Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE) The process for filing a complaint about an academic physical therapy program or a complaint about CAPTE is outlined at the following site https://www.capteonline.org/complaints 106 ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE POLICY FOR FACULTY, STAFF, AND STUDENTS Pursuant to federal law, the University adopted a policy on alcohol and drug abuse in the fall of 1990.

Health Risks of Alcohol and Drug Abuse The scope and impact of health risks from alcohol and drug abuse are both alarming and well documented, ranging from mood altering to life threatening, with consequences that extend beyond the individual to family, organizations, and society at large. The University therefore conducts regular programs to educate its faculty, staff, and students that the abuse of alcohol and other drugs alters behavior, distorts perception, impairs thinking, impedes judgment, and sabotages opportunity. Alcohol and drug abuse also may result in deterioration of physical health by causing or contributing to various diseases, illnesses, congenital disability or person with a birth anomaly and even death. Resources for Education, Consultation, and Counseling The u niversity sponsors several programs that provide information and professional services for its faculty, staff and students on matters related to the misuse and abuse of alcohol and drugs. These programs provide education, consultation, assessment, counseli ng and referral in a professional environment that respects individual confidentiality and integrity. The university 109 maintains the Faculty Staff Assistance Program (FSAP) (404.727.4328 ) for faculty and staff; and the Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) (404.727.7450) and the Office of Health Promotion (404.727.7551) for students. Augmenting these formal programs, a variety of other campus programs and services educate and assist individuals who take the initiative to help themselves. Please see Related Links for additi onal information on these services. Common to all of these programs is the ethic that personal responsibility and professional guidance are keys to success. Therefore, the university expects its faculty, staff, and students to take measures to prevent alco hol and drug misuse and abuse in the community. The university also encourages its members to seek assistance from the above programs if they think that they may have a pr oblem with alcohol or drug use. Distribution This policy, and any revisions thereto, shall be distributed to all faculty, staff, and students annually. Other applicable policies that have reference to this policy are found in the Campus Life Handbook, the Faculty Handbook, the Human Resources Handbook and Policies and Procedures Manual, and the Student Conduct Code.

For a complete list of funding opportuni ties available to students, please visit https://www.emorydpt.org/apply -now/scholarships/ Many students have been successful obtaining scholarship funds thro ugh individual institutions. If you have an idea where you would like to practice for the first two years following graduation, you can call the institution to inquire about a financial assistance program. Many places will offer two years of tuition in e xchange for two or three years of employment. These offers are very generous, but not without drawbacks. First, be certain that you would be interested in living in the area in question and in that particular area of practice. Secondly, be cautious of an institution that requests more than 2.5 years employment. Remember that after beginning employment you may decide to pursue another opportunity. Don't be tied down for too long. Also, be aware of the stipulations of pay back if you choose not to follow the agreement. Some contracts state the loan will be repaid at 20% interest! 119 Guidelines for Student and Employer Contract s 120 Guideline For Student Employer Contract These guidelines are designed to assist the student/new graduate in negotiating appropriate agreements that provide financial assistance in exchange for a promise of future employment. 1.
