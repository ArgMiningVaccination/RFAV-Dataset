It can be caused by various factors, including structural and functional impairments in the mouth, lips, tongue, soft palate, throat, esophagus, and other organs [1]. This condition can lead to adverse events such as choking, coughing, aspiration, malnutrition, and pneumonia, and can significantly impact the quality of life of patients [2]. Patients with certain medical conditions, such as stroke, Parkinson's Disease (PD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD), are at exceptionally high risk *Corresponding author: Yu Qinghua, Suzhou High-tech Zone Hospital of Tradi- Tel: +86 18798019832; E-mail: 1025345545@qq.com Citation: Jun J, Jinrong Z, Ying Y, Qinghua Y (2023) Progress in the Application of Natural Polymer Hydrogel in Swallowing Additives.

Stroke, for instance, has an incidence ranging from 37% to 78% and tends to affect a younger population [3-5]. Similarly, PD affects up to 77% of patients, while AD causes cognitive decline and dysphagia in a significant proportion of patients. These conditions are on the rise, with an estimated 9.8 million AD patients in China alone and a projected worldwide prevalence of 131 million by 2050 [6,7]. Moreover, studies have shown that 68% of elderly people in care homes and 13-38% of those living independently have chewing and swallowing disorders [8]. The management of dysphagia in patients with stroke, PD, and AD is challenging due to the complex nature of these conditions and the limitations of current treatment approaches [9-11]. Many patients require assistance with eating, drinking, and taking medications and may need specialized diets or alternative feeding methods such as na- sogastric or nasoenteral tubes. Although medications can be ground and mixed with water to facilitate swallowing, this approach may not be suitable for all medications and can have limitations in terms of effectiveness and safety [12]. Thickeners can reduce adverse events and improve patient compliance but may not be well tolerated by all patients [13,14]. Classification of Natural Polymer Hydrogels One potential solution for improving swallowing function and re- ducing the risk of adverse events in patients with dysphagia is the use of natural polymer hydrogels [15-17]. These are semi-solid gels de- rived from natural sources with high water content, good smoothness, and taste-masking properties. They also have good biocompatibility, making them suitable for use in the oral cavity [18,19]. Although nat- ural polymer hydrogels have been shown to have significant potential as swallowing thickeners in patients with dysphagia, their use has not yet been widely explored [20]. A hydrogel is a type of polymer mate - rial that is highly moisturizing, absorbs water, and forms a three-di - mensional crosslinked network. It can be made from either water-sol-uble natural or synthetic polymers, and it is converted into a gel using various signals such as changes in temperature, ionic strength, pH value, and ultraviolet irradiation [21,22]. Hydrogels have a wide range of applications, including drug delivery, contact lens manufac - turing, hygiene products, tissue engineering scaffolds, wound dress- ings, cardiac repair, neural tissue repair, tissue regeneration, robots, and flexible electronic devices [23]. Hydrogels have a water content of up to 90% [24] and possess physical and chemical properties such as smoothness, wrapping, and taste masking [19]. Hydrogels are used to develop thickening agents that aid in swallowing medication, food, and drinks for people with dysphagia, thereby reducing complications and improving their quality of life. Natural polymer hydrogels pri- marily include glutin, dextran, and chitosan, as well as proteins such as collagen, gelatin, and filin protein [25].Jun J, et al., J Altern Complement Integr Med 2023, 9: 335 DOI: 10.24966/ACIM-7562/100335 HSOA Journal of Alternative, Complementary & Integrative Medicine Research Article Xu Jun1, Zhao Jinrong1, Yang Ying1 and Yu Qinghua2* 1The People's Hospital of Suzhou New District, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China 2Suzhou High-tech Zone Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Suzhou, Jiangsu, ChinaProgress in the Application of Natural Polymer Hydrogel in Swallowing Additives Abstract Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is a common problem in pa- tients that can lead to various adverse events such as malnutrition, aspiration pneumonia, and difficulty taking medication. Thickeners, which make it easier for substances to pass through the oropharynx to the digestive tract, can reduce these adverse events, improve pa-tient compliance, and enhance the quality of life. One type of thick- ener with significant potential is the natural polymer hydrogel, which has high water content, semi-solid gel consistency, smoothness and taste masking properties, and biocompatibility. Despite these advan - tages, using natural polymer hydrogel as a swallowing thickener has not yet been widely explored. This review aims to discuss the poten- tial application of natural polymer hydrogel as a swallowing thickener in order to draw attention to this promising area of investigation.

Page 2 o 9 J Altern Complement Integr Med ISSN: 2470-7562, Open Access Journal polymer Agar: Agar is polymer polysaccharide obtained from several types of seaweed plants, such as Jiang and stone cauliflower. Due to its excellent thickening and gelling properties, agar is widely used in the food and medical fields [26]. Agarose, which makes up about 80% of agar, is a long-chain neutral polysaccharide consisting of double galactose and 3,6-dehydrated-L-galactopyranose without sulfate, methoxy, or pyruvate groups on residues [27,28] (Figure 1).On the other agar pectin is a non-gelling component. A 0.1% agar solution can form a gel at about 30\u00b0C or a concentration as low as 0.004%, and its gel-forming ability is strongest at the same concentration. Studies have shown that adding 0.3%-0.5% agar to foods such as Babao porridge, tremella, and canned food can signifi- cantly improve the taste, prevent precipitation and stratification, and provide excellent thickening and stability properties [20]. Researchers have used swallowing-assisted gel containing wa- ter, agar, citric acid, xanthan gum, etc., to administer medication to patients with Parkinson's disease and other conditions causing diffi- culty in swallowing [14]. This method reduced the incidence rate of cough in the observation group compared to the control group and also shortened medication time while providing a better experience. Another study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of swallowing assisted gel in taking capsules for dysphagia patients after stroke us- ing a Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS) [29]. The success rate of the observation group was significantly higher than that of the control group, and the use of agar thickener was found to be smoother and more effective in reducing the risk of choking and aspiration for OD patients when eating. These results indicate that agar has superior properties such as wrapping, smoothness, and covering up the taste, making it an excellent option for OD patients to take medicine, eat and drink water smoothly, and improve their quality of life [29]. Carrageenan, a hydrophilic, high-molecular-weight sulfated poly- saccharide extracted algae, is composed galactose and 3,6-dehydrated galactose connected by alternating -1,3 glycoside bonds Multiple isoforms of carrageenan exist, with , , and being the most commonly used types (Figures 2, 3 & 4 for their chemical structures) [30-32]. When exposed to metal ions such as calcium, potassium, sodium, and ammonium, they cross-link to form either a hard and brittle gel or a soft and elastic gel, depending on the type of carrageenan (see Figure 5 for the formation mechanism of -carrageenan) [33,34]. However, -carrageenan cannot form a gel due to the influence of the 3,6-internal ether galactose structure and only exhibits some thickening effect [35]. Carrageenan possesses sev-eral desirable properties such as good gelation, emulsification, thick - ening, and extended shelf life, and is widely used in various foods including jelly, ice cream, pudding, meat products, bread, and more [36,37]. A study demonstrated that adding carrageenan to agarose gel significantly increased the water retention of the agar gel, with a greater effect observed after adding inorganic salt-carrageel [38]. This can be attributed to the fact that the polymerization chain of carra-geenan builds on the spatial reticular structure of agarose, while car - rageenan is negatively charged and polymerizes into longer molecular chains upon the addition of inorganic salt ions. In addition, carrageenan also has antiviral, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-obesity effects [39]. Its activity is influenced by its molecular weight, and it is more effective when the molecular weight is greater than 200kDa [40]. However, the molecu - lar weight varies based on the species of seaweed and the extraction process used. Antiviral activity may be linked to the neutralization of sulfate groups in carrageenan and the positive charge on the host cell surface, which can reduce or prevent virus absorption and pene-tration [41]. Moreover, modifying the carrageenan molecule can en-hance its antibacterial and antitumor activity through methods such as carboxymethylation and thiolization [42]. Considering these potential benefits, carrageenan could be an excellent polymer material for use as a thickening agent for people who have difficulty swallowing. Alginate: Alginate is a natural, water-soluble polymer polysaccha - ride that is composed of D-mannuronic acid (M) and L-guluronic acid (G), derived mainly from sea algae and microorganisms (Figure 6) [43]. The polymer sodium alginate is formed by bonding -D-sodium Mannuronic acid (M unit) and -L-sodium gliuronide (G unit) -1-4 glycoside linkage, ions such as (Ba)2+, Cu2+, or Ca2+ to form a stable gel structure [44]. Ca2+ is a classic crosslinker for preparing alginate Figure 1: The agarose chemical structure formul 2.1.2 Carrageenan. Figure 2: Type carrageenan chemical structure formula.

For example, \"bursting beads\" made of sodium alginate and calcium lactate have a jelly texture and burst into a pulpy texture when broken, which is commonly used in the production of \"bursting beads and milk tea.\" Studies have shown that the main chemical com- ponent of \"bursting beads\" is calcium alginate (Figure 7) [46], which is mainly formed through complexation reaction and crosslinking (Figure 8). Alginate (sodium/calcium) has excellent properties such as thickening, emulsification, stability, and water preservation. Add- ing it to food can significantly improve the hydraulic strength, elastic - ity, and fragility of food, and improve taste due to gelatination [47]. Further studies have indicated that adding a certain ratio of oil gel to the alginate saline gel can effectively modify the viscosity, hard- ness, elasticity, and other properties of the gel, and can better meet the needs of drug wrapping, smoothness, taste, and other aspects [48]. Therefore, alginate can be widely used in research on assisted swal-lowing in medication, eating, and waterintake for patients with OD.Hyaluronic acid: Hyaluronic Acid (HA) is a linear polymer acid composed of D-gluconide and N-acetyl-D glu- conide through -1,3- and -1-4-glycosidic bonds, which does not covalently bind to proteins (Figure 9) [50,51]. Its molecular weight ranges from 1 to 10000 kDa [52]. Low molecular weight HA can activate ERK1/2 to exert pro-angiogenic effects and has some proin-flammatory effects [53,54]. Conversely, high molecular weight HA exhibits the opposite effects [55]. Furthermore, the carboxyl group of HA molecules can be fully ionized under physiological pH con-ditions, and a sticky hydrogel with high water content can be formed under low concentration conditions [50]. Its good hydrophilic nature, viscoelasticity, biocompatibility, receptor recognition, and easy struc- tural modification make it widely used in the biomedical field [56]. Nutritional preparations containing HA thickening can change their rheological characteristics and shear rate, and their viscosity can be regulated by adjusting the mass fraction of HA [57]. The viscosity is relatively stable, which can provide safe nutritional support for OD patients. Therefore, the application of HA can ensure the safety of medication, eating, and drinking water for OD patients and prevent the occurrence of serious complications. Cellulose: Cellulose is a linear polymer composed of -D-glucose groups linked by -1,4 glycoside bonds (Figure 10) [58,59]. It has been extensively utilized as a food additive, thickener, emulsifier, and stabilizer in food ingredients due to its various properties. Cellulose hydrogel has exceptional water retention properties, up to 165.5% [60]. By using Epochloropropane (ECH) as a crosslinking agent, Car - boxymethylcellulose (CMC) can be obtained from the reaction of cel - lulose and sodium monochloroacetate, resulting in a cellulose-based hydrogel that is comparable to the super water-absorbing capacity of polyacrylate [61]. Approximately 99.5% of CMC can be used as an additive in foods such as dairy products. Studies have shown that by adjusting the microcellulose content between 0.05% and 0.7%, the emulsion displays a smaller droplet size, a stronger 3D network-like structure, and a better emulsion condensation degree [62]. Another study has demonstrated that beef meatballs prepared with 88.57% beef, 0.89% CMC, and 0.02% cassava starch (TS) can meet the stan- dards of International Initiative for Dysphagia Diet Standardiza - tion (IDDSI) guidelines for patients with OD [63]. CMC can also Figure 5: Schematic diagram of -type and -type carrageenan appearing to gel under the action of metal ions. Figure 6: alginate chemical structure formula [49].

Additionally, the nanocellulose membrane can hold up to 50% of the drug, with good wrapping and sealing properties, and can slowly release drug activity. Due to the abundant source of cellulose, it can be widely used in various fields, including hydrogel research, swallowing thickening agents, and drug-embedded materials. Hemicellulose : Hemicellulose is a natural hydrophilic high-polymer polysaccharide polymer that has different structures and connection modes depending on the source. It is mainly composed of various monosaccharides such as five-carbon and six-carbon sugars in dif-ferent connection ways (Figure carboxyl, aldehyde, etc.) can form large molecu - lar mass and good mechanical properties, leading to more functional hemicellulose hydrogel after a free radical polymerization reaction [66]. The addition of chitosan, polylactic acid, and modified cellulose polymer to hemicellulose can optimize the hydrophobicity and me-chanical properties of hemicellulose film by changing the distribution and structure of hemicellulose group [67]. Hemicellulose sources are abundant, and the hemicellulose content in plants such as corn cob, sugarcane peel, and pineapple peel can be as high as 30%-35%. It has been shown that the highest hemicellulose yield can be extract - ed from 10% NaOH, and temperature-sensitive hemicellulose-based hydrogels can be prepared by chemical crosslinking [68]. However, the strong fiber sense of food such as meat and vegetables poses a challenge for patients with chewing dysphagia. Although studies have confirmed that controlling food at 1.5cm can effectively reduce the number of chews and meet the chewing requirements [69], the cooking method has a significant impact on nutrients, food softening degree, taste, and other aspects [70]. Therefore, further research is needed to explore how to retain food nutrients, improve taste, and make it easier for patients with dysphagia to chew. Xanthan gum: Xanthan gum is a water-soluble linear structure composed of D-glucose, D-mannose, D-glucuronic acid, acetate, and pyruvate repeat units (Figure 12) [71,72]. It has excellent properties and is widely used in more than 20 fields such as food, medicine, and cosmetics due to its superior rheol-ogy and stability [73]. Studies have demonstrated that a combination of 0.25% carrageenan, 0.20% xanthan gum, and 3.00% denatured starch as additives produces the best quality milk pudding [74]. Yel-low raw gum thickener can also change the viscosity and structural properties of food, resulting in moderate viscosity, low dispersibili - ty, high water content, and a smooth texture after deployment [75]. This makes it suitable for patients with odynophagia after stroke. Sun Yanjun and Zhang Jing [76] found that the use of xanthan gum as a thickener can effectively improve the swallowing function and nu-tritional index of patients with odynophagia after stroke, significant - ly reducing adverse reactions such as aspiration, irritant cough, and abnormal pronunciation. However, another study [77] suggests that stroke patients with odynophagia are more willing to accept degen-eration starch as a thickening agent, while healthy individuals prefer xanthan gum. Therefore, the application of xanthan gum in different odynophagia patients should not only consider factors such as viscos-ity, sliding, and water content, but also how to modify its properties to adapt to changes in patients' oral sensory function. Glucan: Glucan is a polysaccharide polymer composed of glucose units and is classified into two types, -glucan and -glucan, based on the type of glycosidic bond (Figure 13) [78]. -Glucan is mainly com- posed of -1,6-bonds and is similar to starch and dextrins. It is also known as dextran [79,80] and is used as a plasma substitute. On the other hand, -glucan has a main chain of -1,3-glycosidic bonds and branches of -1,2, -1,4, and -1,6 with various biological activities, including leukocyte increase, antiviral, anticoagulant, hypolipidemic, hypoglycemic, immune regulation, and Grafting high molecular weight glucan with zeolysin has been shown to produce a graft emulsion with smaller average particle size, greater viscosity, and higher stability [83], and the vis- cosity of the bovine serum albumin-dextran increases with increasing dextran molecular mass [84]. Additionally, glucan can be chemically modified via oxidation, reduction, and other methods to obtain glucan hydrogel [85] and nuclear-shell-type nanoparticles [86], which can be used for targeted drug delivery. The level of -glu- can content significantly affects the specific capacity, water retention, Figure 10: Cellolose chemical structure formula. Figure 11: Hemicellulose unit structure type.

Huang Xue, Tang Mengqi, and others [87] found that adding 0.06% and 0.08% -glucan to egg white improves its foaming ability and stability, and 0.06% addition can increase cake specific capacity, reduce hardness, and significantly decrease aging rate. -Glucan from oats has been shown to lower postprandial blood glucose concentration, regulate intestinal flora, enhance immunity, and improve postprandial satiety [88]. Zhou Jingqi, Huang Qin, and others [89] found that adding oat -glucan to yam starch significantly reduces its viscoelasticity and increases the anti-starch content from 38.97% to 49.24%, effectively reducing starch consumption, food in-take, and controlling blood sugar and weight, making it especially suitable for patients with diabetes, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascu - lar diseases. Chitosan: Chitosan is a macromolecular polysaccharide that is the only native basic direct chain polymer of chitin, achieved through the removal of the acetyl group in alkaline conditions (Figure 14) [90]. It can generate positively charged amino groups under acidic condi- tions, which, combined with the negative charge of bacteria, exhib- its a bacteriostatic effect. Additionally, chitosan contains hydrophilic groups and demonstrates excellent water absorption energy [91]. Due to its ability to bind with protein and produce a gel-like substance, chitosan is currently used in a variety of high-protein products, such as fish millet, meat stuffing, and tofu. Studies have demonstrated that adding chitosan to tofu and rice noodle strips can enhance their qual-ity and prolong their shelf life. Specifically, one study showed that adding 0.08% chitosan and 1.2% acetic acid, and solidifying at 80, resulted in a new type of tofu with a better structure and higher quality than traditional gypsum tofu. A 1% chitosan solution was also shown to improve the taste of tofu, reduce the water activity in tofu to 0.78, and extend its shelf life to three days [92,93]. Another study found that adding 5g/L of chitosan to rice noodle strips resulted in moderate levels of hardness, viscosity, and elasticity. This inhibited the aging of the strips and significantly reduced their masticability. Furthermore, chitosan increased gel stability during flurization, promoted starch ab- sorption during cooking, and ultimately reduced the hardness of the noodles [94,95]. Beyond its food-related applications, chitosan and its derivatives have demonstrated various biological functions such as fighting cancer, regulating trace elements, regulating intestinal flo- ra, enhancing immunity, and reducing weight loss [96]. Additionally, chitosan oligosaccharides have a low-calorie, refreshing sweet taste and do not affect insulin levels. This makes them a preferred sweeten- er for patients with diabetes and obesity [97]. Given these properties, chitosan and its derivatives may be suitable for use as swallowing additives in OD patients.Guar gum: Guar gum is a natural polymer derived mainly from the endosperm of the guar bean. It is a linear galactomannan with a D-mannose unit (M) connected by -1,4-glycosidic bonds as the main chain (Figure 15) [98]. Due to its superior thickening, water retention, seasoning, and stability properties, it has been widely used in the food industry. Research conducted by Zhao Mouming, Yang Yuanyuan, and others [99] found that adding 0.24% konjac gum and 0.16% guar bean gum to preserved pork best improves its texture, color quality, water content, sensory characteristics, softness, and gel characteristics, thereby prolonging its storage time. In another study [100], adding 4.0g/L of konjac gum and melon bean gum (in a 7:3 ratio) significantly improved the hardness, elasticity, glue, and mas- ticability of duck blood bean curd. In addition, the section appeared bright, smooth, and had fine pores. When adding 3.5g/L of Arabic gum and melon bean gum (in a 7:3 ratio), the gel characteristics of duck blood tofu significantly improved, with its hardness, elasticity, and water retention reaching 4217.33g, 0.88, and 66.97%, respective - ly. However, there is no relevant evidence of swallowing thickening agent research, requiring further study. Natural polymer protein-class hydrogels Collagen: Collagen, a biological polymer material composed of three polypeptide chains, is responsible for about 30% of the total protein in animals and plays an important role in the mechanical protection of tissues and organs [101]. Figure 16 shows the formation process of collagen. Due to its low immunogenicity, biodegradability, cell compatibility, and ability to modify its biological properties as per requirements, collagen finds wide application in surgical sutures, skin repair, stents, food, adhesives, and other fields [102]. Collagen is found abundantly in the connective tissue of animals, with pig skin being the most common source in daily life and accounting for about 87.7% of the total protein content [103]. Different extraction meth - ods yield varying acquisition rates and purity of collagen, with the Figure 13: Glucan structure formula. Figure 14: Chitosan Structure Type. Figure 15: Guar glue structure type.Citation: Jun J, Jinrong Z, Ying Y, Qinghua Y (2023) Progress in the Application of Natural Polymer Hydrogel in Swallowing Additives. J Altern Complement Integr Med 9: 335. Page 6 o 9 J Altern Complement Integr Med ISSN: 2470-7562, Open Access Journal DOI:10.24966/ACIM-7562/100335 Volume 9 Issue 2 100335acquisition rate ranging from 43.2%-65.33% and the purity being as high as 85.44%-87.38% [104,105]. OD patients are often accompa - nied by various cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk factors and have low fat and high protein requirements. Gel collagen food can fulfill these requirements, and embedding food or drugs in collagen gel can help OD patients complete swallowing actions and prevent the occurrence of aspiration and choking. Currently, collagen-con - taining products in domestic and foreign markets primarily include protein powder, tablets, capsules, and protein drinks, with meat skin jelly and fish scale cream being the most commonly consumed in dai-ly life [106]. Therefore, the application of collagen in swallowing aids should be further explored for OD patients. Gelatin : Gelatin is a natural, fat-free, high protein substance contain - ing 18 amino acids obtained by the degradation of collagen through the action of acid, alkali, and enzymes [108]. It has various applica - tions in drug sustained release, food additives, adhesives, and other fields. The structure and biological characteristics of gelatin are high-ly similar to those of collagen. It is insoluble in cold water and forms a thermal reversible gel with low gelling and high water content. It has no fat, no cholesterol, and a protein content of more than 82% [109]. As a swallowing aid, gelatin satisfies the dietary requirements of low fat and low cholesterol for elderly patients with OD. Its melt - ing point is close to oral temperature, making it easy to eat almost without chewing, and it has good emulsification properties. Adding gelatin to meat product thick soup can emulsify oil and form a thick soup that is easy to swallow, digest, and not greasy [110]. Studies by Guo Pei, Li Chuan, and others [111] have shown that tilapia skin gelatin can significantly improve the hardness, adhesive viscosity, masticability, and gel strength of surimi products. Similarly, studies by Li Jun, Meng Shaohua, and others [112] have shown that adding a certain amount of fish skin gelatin to chicken sausage can increase its hardness, adhesion, chewing ability, and water retention, which are positively correlated with the amount of additives. Gelatin can also improve the paste viscosity, water content, and soft hardness of wheat flour and suppresses aging for a long time at 5% of addition [113]. This provides further possibilities for the study of gelatin as a thickening agent in patients with OD.2.2.3 Filin protein Filin protein is the primary constituent of silk, comprising hydrophilic chains (Tyr, Ser) and hydrophobic chains (Gly, Ala) that alternate in a sequence of 18 natural polymers composed of 18 amino acids. These polymers include serine (12%), alanine (30%), and glycine which are essential amino acids [114,115]. Filin protein is easily absorbed after in vivo degradation, and exhibits good biocompatibility, making it a focus of research in the biomedical field. Research has shown that filin protein solutions quickly become glue in alkaline environments with high concentration and temperature, but considerations of en-vironmental homeostasis and hydrogel use should be taken into ac- count when producing hydrogels [116]. The biological properties and applications of filament proteins vary significantly in their conforma- tional transitions and crystallinity content [114]. Filin protein can be used to create particles, films, stents, hydrogels, and more, depend- ing on specific needs [117]. However, further research is necessary to determine the potential applications of filin in swallowing additives, food thickeners, and food additives (Figure 17). Summary and Outlook China is currently facing one of the fastest aging populations in the world. By 2050, it is projected that the number of elderly individuals will exceed 400 million, reaching approximately 30% of the popu- lation [118]. Many of these individuals, including those with stroke, Parkinson's Disease (PD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and other age-related conditions, experience various degrees of chewing and swallowing difficulties. This can lead to an increased risk of choking, aspiration pneumonia, decreased immunity, infections, and psycho- logical disorders, ultimately reducing their quality of life and overall happiness. Natural polymer hydrogels have unique properties such as good biocompatibility, water retention, wrapping, taste covering, shaping, thickening, and smoothness. These materials can effectively wrap around food, drugs, and other substances, facilitating their pas-sage through the oropharynx and reducing the fear of eating, chewing, and swallowing difficulties that are often experienced by OD patients. This can help to prevent physical decline and deterioration, while also reducing the risk of aspiration, cough, aspiration pneumonia, and as- phyxia. Natural polymer materials are widely used in food, biomedi - cine, environmental protection, and other fields due to their low cost, non-toxicity, biodegradability, and biological activity (such as blood glucose reduction, immune regulation, intestinal flora regulation, etc.). However, the development of swallowing thickening agents us- ing these materials has not received sufficient attention. Therefore, it is crucial to explore how natural polymer hydrogel materials can be utilized to develop a batch of high-nutritional-value, smooth, and easy-to-chew swallowing additives for OD patients in accordance with the Chinese swallowing disorder rehabilitation evaluation and treatment experts consensus (2017 edition). This could significantly improve the quality of life for OD patients.
