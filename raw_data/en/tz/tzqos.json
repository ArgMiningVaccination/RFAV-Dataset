I am so proud of the staff who are spotlighted in theseissues as they demonstrate what professionalnursing brings to health care and why ourpatients often praise caregivers in this setting.Our publication also informs readers abouthow patient care and nursing practice havechanged over time. Nurses are continuouslyexpanding their knowledge and skills. The Institute of Medicine's Quality Chasm Series on Keeping Patients Safe (2004) is amust-read. This report adds to our under-standing of how to keep patients safe from thecombined effects of the complexities of ourtechnologically driven, compartmentalizedhealth care system and the fallibility of humanhealth care providers, managers, and leadership within that system. Because nurses are with patients most of the time during theirhospitalization, patients depend upon them fortheir safe recovery. Many things can affect howwell nurses play a role in the safety of theirpatients. There is mounting evidence about the critical role of the nurse in the U.S. healthcare system. Patient safety and quality are at the forefront of today's delivery of health care, and nurseschampion those efforts in countless ways. Inthis issue of Nursing , you'll read about nurses' efforts to ensure safe, high-quality care by preventing infections and providing comple-mentary therapeutic modalities. In these areas,as in all others, the nurses of Hartford Hospitaldemonstrate their commitment to bringing thevery best nursing practice to everything they do.Patients and families who come toHartford Hospital trust us to keep themsafe while providing excellent medical care. As volunteers who represent the commu-nity, members of our Board of Directorsunderstand that they are ultimately responsiblefor ensuring that the hospital honors this trustby providing the highest quality of care. TheBoard looks to the leadership of the clinicalstaff and the guidance of management to help itfulfill that responsibility. The Board's involvement in quality and patient safety takes many forms. The subject ison the agenda of every Board meeting andreceives just as much attention as finances.Board members receive reports on how thehospital is doing with regard to standards setby the state Department of Public Health. Members of the Boardsit on the Quality and Patient Safety Council, which meets monthlyto explore ways to continuously improve the hospital's perform-ance and measure it against national standards. When a teamfrom the Joint Commission visits, the board meets with them todiscuss our strategies for achieving quality and patient safety.The relationship between the Board and physicians also focuses on quality. The Boardconducts a thorough assessment of a physi-cian's qualifications and practice patternsbefore recommending him or her forappointment to our Medical Staff. Recently,the Board authorized the establishment of anew physician position, vice president forquality and patient safety, to provide central-ized leadership for our entire quality program.The appointment of Jamie M. Roche, MD,MMM, CPE, to this position underscores thecommitment the Board and management havemade to quality and patient safety. As the people who spend the most time with patients and families, nurses play a cen-tral role in the hospital's ability to provideexcellent care and merit the community's trust. While the Board, management and Medical Staff are allcommitted to quality and patient safety, it is the nurse who trulypersonifies Hartford Hospital in the eyes of those we serve. 2HARTFORD HOSPITAL NURSING / AUTUMN 2007 To Our Readers John Meehan. President and Chief Executive Officer, Hartford Hospital Laura Caramanica, RN, PhD Vice President, Nursing Hartford Hospital (HHSN '72)Meriting the Community's Trust Champions of Quality and Patient Safety3HARTFORD HOSPITAL NURSING / AUTUMN 2007Hartford Hospital Selected for NCI Pilot Program The Cancer Program at Hartford Hospital is one of only 10 entities in the country\u2014and the only one in New England\u2014to be chosento participate in the pilot phase of the new National CancerInstitute Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP). If fullyimplemented, the program will help bring state-of-the-art cancercare to patients in hospitals across the United States. The NCCCP isdesigned to encourage the collaboration of private-practice med-ical, surgical and radiation oncologists. It will research new andenhanced ways to assist, educate and better treat the needs ofunderserved populations, including elderly, rural, inner-city andlow-income patients, as well as racial and ethnic groups withunusually high cancer rates. Evidence from a wide range of studiessuggests that cancer patients diagnosed and treated in a setting of multispecialty care and clinical research may live longer and have a better quality of life. The selection of Hartford Hospital's Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center for this extremely competitive program was based on sever-al factors, including the hospital's leadership role in excellent caredelivery, clinical research programs, outreach efforts, survivorshipprograms, pathology biospecimen expertise and cancer informa-tion systems. Andrew Salner, MD, director of Hartford Hospital's Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center, notes, \"This recognition reflects theexpertise of all the many medical specialists and staff from all services at Hartford Hospital that contribute to the care of cancerpatients. Participation in this program will further ensure ourleadership role in cancer care in New England, and facilitate ourmeaningful contribution to advancing significant issues related tocancer prevention, early detection, treatment and research.\"Hospital Wins VHA Award Thanks to achievements in the Bliss 11-I and 7-I intensive careunits, VHA recently presented Hartford Hospital with its award fortight glycemic control among ICU patients. Evidence shows that critically ill patients in intensive care have better outcomes when their blood sugars are maintained at opti-mal levels. Translating that knowledge into everyday practice wasone of the goals of the TICU (Transforming the Intensive Care Unit)initiative launched by VHA and the Institute for Health CareImprovement in 2001. Hartford Hospital was one of the first insti-tutions to participate in the initiative. The 14 institutions nationwidethat formed the initial group are now collectively known as Wave 1or the Critical Care Innovation Network. Hartford Hospital received the award because it performed far better than other Wave 1 institutions in controlling patients' glucose levels. \"A three-year, continuous linear progression showed that 52 percent to 60 percent of blood sugars were in the normal rangein Bliss 11-I, and 63 percent were in the normal range in 7-I,\"says LuAnn Mahoney, RN, BSN, CNA-BC, unit manager of Bliss 11-I. Ms. Mahoney says the units' success is largely due to continuous performance monitoring and feedback and a greater receptivenessto change.Nursing News and Notes Baby-Friendly Award Renewed Hartford Hospital once again has won the prestigious Baby-Friendly Award from Baby-Friendly USA. The award is valid for five years. Hartford Hospital first wonthe award in 2000, making it the first hospital in the state and only the 28th inthe country to achieve the coveted designation. The redesignation is contingenton the hospital's completing certain quality-improvement initiatives. Baby-Friendly USA is a nonprofit group that advocates for breast feeding. It originated with guidelines developed by the World Health Organization andUNICEF. Those guidelines were aimed at encouraging breast feeding worldwideto promote child health and reduce infant mortality. Winning the Baby-Friendly designation is challenging. Through a site visit and comprehensive documentation, hospitals and birthing centers must demonstratethat they follow WHO and UNICEF guidelines summarized in the \"10 Steps toSuccessful Breastfeeding.\" Those steps include having and communicating a written breast-feeding policy and training all staff in its implementation, educating pregnant women about the benefits of breast feeding, helping new mothers begin breast feeding within an hour of birth, not giving newborns any nourishment other than breast milk unless medical ly necessary, and establishing support groups for breast-feeding mothers. Within each step are more detailed requirements that a h ospital must show it is meeting. Sara Young, MSN, IBCLC, a clinical nurse specialist and lactation consultant who oversees Hartford Hospital's Lactation Service s, notes, \"We feel quite honored to have received this designation, which is difficult to get and to maintain, and we appreciate all of t he hard work that's gone into attaining it.\" Sara Young, MSN, IBCLC, left, with new mother Aimee Garbett, holding baby Lila, and Pam Gregg, RN.4HARTFORD HOSPITAL NURSING / AUTUMN 2007Although she'd been a nurse for more than 20 years, Alice Moore, RN, BS, RMT, was extremely apprehensive when in the mid-1990sshe was about to undergo surgery for the first time. She was nerv-ous about the surgery itself, but also concerned about recoveringquickly so she could get back to work as soon as possible. Aliceturned for help to several practices she'd studied over the years,including yoga, Reiki, therapeutic touch and guided imagery. Sheused these techniques to prepare her mind and body prior to surgery and to enhance her recovery afterward. The results wereimpressive. She went home quickly, required very little pain med-ication and was up and walking in almost no time. \"I had such aspeedy recovery that my doctor was shocked,\" Ms. Moore recalls.\"She said to me, 'You need to share this with other people,because you recovered much faster than most patients.'\" Today, Ms. Moore, along with her colleagues and volunteers in Hartford Hospital's Integrative Medicine program, is sharing theseand many other healing techniques with patients and staff in everyarea of the hospital. Hartford Hospital's Integrative Medicine Program was officially launched in 1999 by an interdisciplinary group that included Ms. Moore, who is now the Reiki coordinator and nurse educator,and Marcia Rothwell, LMT, who is now the program's director.Today, Integrative Medicine has a staff of 20 and a Reiki volunteerforce of 50. The program's services are very much in demand. Patients and families request services frequently, and physiciansand nurses often order them for patients. In honor of NursesWeek this year, hospital administration arranged for all staff members who were interested to have chair massages. \"We'revery proud of all we're able to offer,\" says Marcia Rothwell. A Constellation of Complementary Techniques Research has shown that time-tested relaxation techniques help decrease anxiety, strengthen the immune system, diminish painand accelerate healing. While traditional medicine focuses on thephysical aspects of healing, health professionals now recognizethat healing incorporates the mind, body and spirit. Patients whouse these techniques feel a greater sense of involvement in theirown health. The hospital's Integrative Medicine Program todayoffers a full range of complementary therapies, including acupunc-ture, art for healing, guided imagery, massage therapy, imagerypreparation for surgery, Reiki therapy and therapeutic touch. Inthe hands of skilled and experienced people specially trained towork in a hospital setting, these techniques are providing measurable benefits to countless Hartford Hospital patients. Integrative Medicine: More Ways to Help and Heal Alice Moore, RN, BS, RMT, right, demonstrates Reiki therapy. Hartford Hospital is a leader in offering complementary therapies that promote wellnessin body, mind and spirit.5HARTFORD HOSPITAL NURSING / AUTUMN 2007Women's Health Was Pioneer Women's Health was among the first Hartford Hospital divisions to embrace complementary techniques, and the division's suc-cessful use of these therapies in the late 1990s was one of thefactors that contributed to the program's creation. \"Women's Health has always been a big promoter,\" says Marcia Rothwell. \"Even before we had a real IntegrativeMedicine program, we started a Reiki program on North 8along with pre-surgery guided imagery and baby massage.\" In Women's Health, acupuncture is used successfully to relieve nausea associated with pregnancy. Therapeutic massagehelps relieve women's back pain, both during pregnancy andwhile in labor. Once a baby has been born, the IntegrativeMedicine staff is available to provide massage for mother,father and baby alike. Ms. Rothwell notes that several coupleswho had been having difficulty conceiving became pregnantafter using acupuncture. Making a Positive Difference Hartford Hospital is nationally known for the size and quality ofits Reiki program, which is co-directed by Alice Moore fromIntegrative Medicine and Eileen Pelletier from VolunteerServices. The program has previously received the AmericanSociety of Directors of Volunteer Services' ExtraordinaryProgram Award. One of the places Reiki is used most often isin Oncology. The therapy helps patients relax, diminishing thestress of the illness as well as the fatigue typically associatedwith chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Acupuncture and mas-sage have also been shown to lessen cancer pain and reducethe nausea that often accompanies cancer treatment. Thanks toAndrew Salner, MD, who directs Hartford Hospital's cancerprogram, Integrative Medicine has been able to produce infor-mational packets thatare given to all cancerpatients. The materialexplains each modality, of help offerscomments from patientswho experienced them.\"We have a very cancerpatients who have pre-pare for surgery. Theprogram offers Peggy Huddleston's \"Prepare for Surgery, HealFaster\" book and relaxation CD to use before, during and aftersurgery. Ms. Rothwell recalls a patient using the CD before having surgery for breast cancer. \"Her family told me they sawa huge change in her. She went into surgery no longer afraid,\" says Ms. Rothwell. Darrin D'Agostino, DO, MPH, an internist specializing in neuromusculoskeletal medicine, is medical director ofIntegrative Medicine and frequently uses the therapies in hispractice. \"I use these therapies to augment traditional treatments pro- vided through internal medicine,\" Dr. D'Agostino says. \"I havepersonally seen patients with GI problems obtain relief fromnausea and vomiting after acupuncture. I've used massage ther-apy in asthmatic patients to improve lung compliance. We'renot replacing traditional medicine, but rather offering comple-mentary therapies in addition to medications and treatmentsthat are known to work.\" Karen Kramer, RN, BS, NHC, QTTT, is a nurse in one of Hartford Hospital's intensive care units and teaches therapeutictouch through the Integrative Medicine program. Like Ms.Moore, she learned the benefits of complementary therapiesthrough personal experience. Following a car accident that lefther with a whiplash injury and generalized pain not relieved by conventional therapies, she sought out a practitioner of therapeutic touch. \"I was skeptical, but that evening following the treatment I was moving better and was able to sit longer,\" Ms. Kramerrecalls. \"I took a course just so I could use it on myself torelieve pain, never expecting to have a practice or teach it.\"She chose to teach it because \"it worked so well for me, and I wanted others to know about this therapy that can ease pain.\" Working in the ICU, Ms. Kramer sees firsthand how thera- peutic touch can benefit patients who are extremely ill. Sheoften provides therapeutic touch for patients just before andjust after they're taken off ventilators, and she says that patientswho have it typically do better. It also benefits patients who are very restless and agitated.They often become muchcalmer and need lessmedication. It helps atthe end of life, too. \"When someone is dying, it sets a peacefulatmosphere,\" Ms.Kramer says. \"It makesthe transition of dyingeasier for both Medicine is everywhere. In thehospital's BrownstoneAmbulatory Clinic,acupuncture, massage,Reiki and other therapies are provided to patients who are referred by their primary caredoctors.

Sound healing with Tibetan singing bowls is offered in Dialysis. The program also offers a variety of workshops andclasses that give patients the ability to participate more activelyin their own healing. Topics include Reiki, Mindfulness BasedStress Reduction, Art for Healing, Sound Healing andTherapeutic Touch. Patients and staff surveyed indicate a strong positive response to complementary therapies. For example, after mas-sage or Reiki, 97 percent of patients said their sleep improvedeither somewhat or a great deal, and 91 percent reportedreduction in nausea. Employees surveyed before and after Reikitherapy noted dramatic reductions in tension, pain and fatigue.Eighty-five percent of patients stated they were likely to chooseHartford Hospital for future admissions because of theIntegrative Medicine program The Nurse's Perspective Karen Kramer says that her involvement with therapeutic touchand the Integrative Medicine program is a \"fantastic\" comple-ment to her work as a nurse. And she has written articles encouraging nurses to use the technique to benefit both patients and themselves. \"Nurses need to know that this is wonderful, not just for their patients, but for themselves. It helps with a sense ofgrounding and peace,\" she says. In helping to launch the program and in her role as coordi- nator of the Reiki volunteer program, Alice Moore says hernursing experience has been \"priceless,\" because she understood how a hospital operates and how best to interactwith staff and patients. Her work has been rewarding in hercareer, as well. \"Although the scientific part of nursing is so important, there was always a part of me that remembered the gentle touch andcompassion that characterized my beginnings as a nurse,\" Ms.Moore says. \"I never wanted to lose that compassionate touchwhen things became so high-tech. There's more to healing thanjust medicine or surgery or traditional ideas about what healingand caring are all about.\" Through the Integrative Medicine program, that concept has become woven into the fabric of care at Hartford Hospital. Anyone who's ever loved a cat or dog knows that the human-animal bond ispowerful and profound. And research shows that animal companionship is healthy, too\u2014lowering blood pressure, relieving depression, reducing stress-related aches andpains and more. At Hartford Hospital, the benefits of canine company are brought rightto the bedside by the Pet Therapy Program. Now in its 14th year, the Pet Therapy Program's seeds were sown by oncologist Robert Martin, MD, who used to bring his dog, Abby, along with him on rounds.Patients and staff enjoyed the experience so much that Abby was nominated forEmployee of the Year two years in a row, and a full-fledged Pet Therapy Program wasborn. In 2007, the program was honored with two awards from the ConnecticutVeterinary Medicine Association. Kelly Boothby, CAVS, manager of Volunteer Services, heads up the program and has seen its benefits firsthand. \"We've seen patients with Alzheimer's who have been unresponsive sit up and reach out to pet the visiting dogs,\" she says. \"The volunteers who come in with their dogs nev-er leave without someone saying, 'Thank you for sharing your dog,' or 'You made myday,' or 'This meant so much to my parent.' The visit breaks up patients' days and takestheir minds off of what's wrong with them. And there's a connection between humansand animals we just can't explain.\" Ms. Boothby recalls going into a dialysis unit with a team and finding patients quietly listening to music or reading. By the time the dog and its owner left, all the patientswere talking happily to each other. The dog had brought them together. Thirty-six dog owners volunteer in the program, and about half of them are hospital employees. Owners and dogs go through a special training program to become certifiedfor pet therapy. Teams go to nearly every unit in the hospital, including the Institute ofLiving. Families or patients may request pet therapy or doctors or nurses can order itfor their patients. Ms. Boothby says nursing is very supportive of the program.\"Sometimes it's hard to get the dogs away from the nurses so we can get them to the patients!\"Comfort on Four Paws Hartford Hospital's Pet Therapy Program in action.7HARTFORD HOSPITAL NURSING / AUTUMN 2007Battling Infection Hospital-wide Pat Frasier, RN, BSN, unit manager of C12. People check into hospitals to get better, not to get sick. Yet,according to the Centers for Disease Control, health care-related infections number more than 2 million annuallyand result in as many as 90,000 deaths and $4.5 billionin excess health care costs. Hartford Hospital is taking theoffense against infection rates through initiatives designedto make the hospital a safer, healthier place for patientsand staff alike, and nurses play a critical role. First Line of Defense One of the simplest, yet most powerful measures in pre-venting the spread of infection is hand-washing. Yetcaregivers nationwide typically wash their hands beforeand after patient contact only 30 percent of the time,according to Susan Malo-Schlegel, RN, MPH, CIC, an epi-demiology clinician in the hospital's Division ofEpidemiology. Finding ways to get patient care assistantsand other caregivers to wash every single time is part ofher job\u2014and part of the job of every nurse on every unit. \"Nurses are responsible for washing their own hands before going near a patient, but also have the responsibil-ity to monitor all the other people working under theirpurview,\" says Ms. Malo- Schlegel. \"The nurse has to be sure that all the people touching that patient are wash-ing their hands and following precautions. Nursing ispivotal, and it's a really big job.\" To make hand cleansing faster and easier, the Division of Epidemiology, along with the hospital's interdisciplinaryInfection Control Committee, in 2003 arranged for 2,000Purell \u00aeInstant Hand Sanitizer dispensers to be installed strategically throughout the hospital. Ms. Malo-Schlegelsays the move significantly increased hand-washing. \"The Purell \u00aeproducts are very fast. Ten seconds, and you're done. That's made it much more convenient, andthat's made all the difference,\" she says. Part of the educational challenge faced by Ms. Malo- Schlegel and her colleague, epidemiology clinician JoyceSauv\u00e9, RN, BSN, CIC, is making people aware that examgloves are not a substitute for hand-washing. \"The intention behind exam gloves is to decrease the bacterial load a person is exposed to, but they're not per-fect by any means. You still have to wash your handswhen you take them off,\" Ms. Malo-Schlegel notes.Hartford Hospital nurses are on the front lines in the effort to prevent nosocomial infections.8HARTFORD HOSPITAL NURSING / AUTUMN 2007At the Institute of Living, Hartford Hospital's Division of Psychiatry, Ann MacGillis, RN, MS, CIC, ACRN, serves asAIDS liaison nurse and infection control nurse. She's alsoa part-time infection control nurse at the main campus.Ms. MacGillis regularly talks about good hand hygienewith anyone who will spend time with a patient, and ofteneducates patients themselves. \"We see many people who come here from shelters, and they often don't have the best hygiene, so we provideeducation for them, as well as making sure our colleagues use good practices,\" Ms. MacGillis says. Sheand IOL nurses educate patients on other matters, too,including how to cover coughs and sneezes during coldand flu season. The \"Ask Us\" Campaign This past spring, the infection control teamlaunched a creative initiative to promotemore consistent hand-washing. The \"Ask Us\"campaign enlists the help of patients and families in ensuring good hand hygiene. Thecampaign urges patients and their families toask caregivers\u2014before they touch thepatient\u2014whether they've washed their hands. \"Caregivers don't lack knowledge about hand-washing. In fact, they think they do it,\"says Ms. Malo-Schlegel. Yet observation studies tell a different story. \"The thought behind this campaign wasthat health care consumers today are much more savvyand engaged. Why not let them be part of this effort?\" The team placed \"Ask Us\" posters in patient rooms, along with explanatory materials, and had \"Ask Us\" but-tons made for staff members to wear. The campaign wasrolled out unit-by-unit beginning in April, with Center 12,Bliss 11-I and 11-E, Center 9 WI and North 11 the first tohave the program. The program is expected to be in allhospital and outpatient units by year-end. The team will beconducting studies to measure the program's effectiveness. \"One of the reasons for starting the 'Ask Us' program is so patients will ask the question of allof us,\" Ann MacGillis says. \"It can be hard for a nurse to tell a doctorto 'put on these gloves' or 'wash your hands.'\" Staying Vigilant Members of the Division of Epidemiology are constantlyon the lookout for infection trouble-spots. Once they'veidentified areas needing improvement, they work with theInfection Control Committee to develop appropriatestrategies to address them. Brian Cooper, MD, chief of the hospital's Division of Infectious Diseases and Division of Epidemiology, says,\"We have ongoing surveillance efforts for nosocomial infections. We collect and analyze data to identify clustersof infections and use our findings to drive the hospital'spolicies and procedures.\" One of the types of infections the hospital tracks is that caused by Clostridium difficile, an organism that is associ-ated with antibiotic use and results in serious diarrhea. A spore-forming organism, it is contagious and difficult toeradicate. In 2005, Hartford Hospital, like hospitalsnationwide, noted a dramatic increase in these types ofinfections. The team responded swiftly. \"We formed a task force and developed a comprehen- sive effort to prevent these infections,\" says Dr. Cooper.\"We've instituted improvements in hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, contact isolation and barrier precautions. Indications are that infection rates have fallen on nursing floors that are in compli- ance with these practices, and we are continuing to monitor results.\" Center 12, a medical floor specializing in infectious disease, was one of the pilot units for the rollout of the new guidelines. Patients admitted to this unit often have conditions such as meningitis, pneumonia, HIV, hepati- tis and tuberculosis, and they often come in with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE)or C. difficile. Nursing staff on this unit already had special expertise in infection-control practices such ascontact isolation. Through a series of in-services by SusanMalo-Schlegel and Joyce Sauv\u00e9, they gained even greaterknowledge and became familiar with new environmentalservices practices. \"The goal is to have an extremely solid understanding of what each organism is, how it's spread and why you'redoing what you're doing,\" says Pat Frasier, RN, BSN, unitmanager of C12. \"Once you fully understand the underly-ing concepts of infection and infection control, theprecautions become very logical.\" Once the new guidelines were in place, Ms. Frasier and the C12 staff initially spent much of their time discussingwhat to do and what not to do with staff from manydepartments in the hospital, such as Transport, Food andNutrition, Environmental Services, Social Services, PatientSupport and Pastoral Care. \"Everyone is involved in infection control,\" says Ms. Frasier, \"As staff, you become the teachers and the gate-keepers to the rooms.\" Because of their expertise and experience, staff members on C12 have become of an in-house resourcefor other hospital units. Dr. Cooper notes that the role of nursing in infection control cannot be overstated. \"Nurses are the crux of this, because if they're not behind these programs, the programs are doomed to fail-ure. We can do nothing unless we have smart nursescarrying out effective policies.This requires not just intelli-gence, but a sense ofcommitment and an activeinvolvement in making sure thatpolicies are carried out. We wantnurses to be compulsive, and wewant them to correct people whoare not as compulsive. Nursesare the protectors of theirpatients, and they should nothesitate to correct a medical staffor house staff member whenthere's an issue over this.\" On the Horizon Two new initiatives are aimed at preventing the spread of contagious diseases in the hospi-tal. The team is working with the hospital's OccupationalHealth Department to systematically offer vaccines to staff.One is the combination tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis vac-cine. National vaccine authorities have recommended thisfor health care workers because of a nationwide spike inthe number of cases of whooping cough. The other is thecombined mumps/measles/rubella vaccine. This is in response to recent mumps outbreaks in Canada and theAmerican Midwest that suggest immunity from childhoodvaccinations weakens over time. Plus, some individualswere never adequately immunized. \"These will protect staff members and their families, and will also prevent them frompassing these diseases along topatients who can ill affordanother illness,\" says Dr.Cooper. The vaccination program is expected to be completed by the end of summer 2008. Connecticut, like several other states, has enacted legislation requiring hospitals to publicly report health care-associated infections. AllConnecticut hospitals will berequired to begin submitting these reports to the state Department of Public Healthbeginning in October 2008. \"This will require much more intensive surveillance,\" says Dr. Cooper. \"We're looking closely at what else wewill need in terms of infection control resources in orderto take this on. It's going to be significant.\" 9HARTFORD HOSPITAL NURSING / AUTUMN 2007 The Infection Control staff use a special lotion, visible only in black light, to teach employees proper hand-washing. Participants apply the lotion and wash their hands, then hold them under black light to see whether they've removed all of the \"contaminant.\" \"Nurses are the protectors of their patients, and they should not hesitate to correct a medical staff or house staff member when there's an issue over this.\" PHOTOS BT KEVIN HAGAN10HARTFORD HOSPITAL NURSING / AUTUMN 2007Preparing New Nurses for the ICU By 2020, the United States is expected to have 1 million fewer nurses than it needs to meet society's demand. One of the areasthat will be most affected by the shortage will be intensive careunits. To address this anticipated shortfall, Hartford Hospital thissummer launched an innovative program to prepare recent nurs-ing graduates to work in the ICU. The Graduate Nurse to Intensive Care Unit program builds on an earlier program designed to prepare experienced nurses forICU roles. The new program is six months long and features astaged orientation designed to move participants graduallythrough very complex classes. \"The educational experience includes classroom work, pre- cepted time and computer-based learning,\" says educator LizaNowicki, RN, and [computer- based learning system] Microsim, to help participants translate theory into practice in a safe learning environment.\" The curriculum was tailored to meet the unique needs of new graduate nurses, says Cathy Yavinsky, RN, MS, CNAA-BC, nursingdirector, surgery and transplant, who spearheaded development ofthe program. \"The ICU is a highly complex, high-tech environment,\" she says. \"It requires new graduates to assimilate rapidly changingpatient assessments and anticipate outcomes of interventions onunstable patients. Transitioning from nursing school to work is challenging enough. But it's even more challenging going fromtraining into an ICU environment.\" Topics covered in the course include arrhythmia recognition, cardiovascular assessment, managing emergency situations,hemodynamic monitoring and care of the ventilated patient.Dealing with life and death and with patients and families in crisisis also part of the training. Ms. Yavinsky notes that nurse managers and staff in the ICUs have embraced the program and welcomed the first eightparticipants.Evidence-based Practice Highlighted at ResearchConference The 11th Annual Research Conference presented by the Institute for Health Care Education and the Connecticut Nursing ResearchAlliance was held on Friday, Oct. 12, at Hartford Hospital'sEducation Resource Center. More than 300 people attended thefull-day conference, which featured nationally known speakers,abstract presentations and skill-building and poster sessions. The keynote speaker was John Nelson, RN, MS, president of Healthcare Environment Inc., an international data managementand consultation company. Mr. Nelson's research focuses on eval-uating care as perceived by the patient using Watson's Theory ofCaring. The subject of his address was The Essentials and Impactof Relationship-based Care. Cindy Connolly, PhD, RN, PNP , addressed the plenary session. A historian of nursing, Dr. Connolly's work draws on social historymethodology to provide insight into the intellectual foundations ofnursing practices and analyze the legacy of past politics in currenthealth and social-welfare policies. She spoke on The DNA ofNursing: Knowing Nursing's History. Hartford Hospital's Janice Cousino, RN, MSN, and Amy Schroder, RNC, planning committee co-chairs, intro-duced the conference.

JOY MILLERPromoting Nursing as a Career As most of you know from recent news articles as well as your own experience, the nursing shortage is a real-ity. Over the last 10 years, this \"problem\" has grownuntil it is now recognized by hospital administratorsand nurse advocates as a \"crisis,\" with an estimated 9 percent of nursing positions remaining unfilled.Some expect that number to triple by 2020 as the babyboomers retire. The reasons for this are complex and multifaceted. One reason may be the pay scale, which has not keptup with inflation. Another is the training process. Theattempt by nursing organizations to promote nursing to the level of professionalism it deserves by focusing on advanced degrees has merit. The advances in medical care demand the quality that education can provide.Unfortunately, the ability of diploma graduates to achieve a BS degree or higher ishindered by the reality of finances (or lack thereof), time away from family and theworkforce, and the unwillingness of some institutions to give credit for diplomacourses and work experience. Many colleges and universities are unable to attractqualified professors of nursing, since they are simply not available. Many older, moreexperienced nurses are choosing to leave the profession due to the frustrations ofinadequate pay, long hours and endless paperwork. And the multitude of careeropportunities available to high school students too often leaves nursing far down onthe list of choices. So what can be done to solve this crisis? I feel that we nurses have a responsibili- ty to promote nursing as a career. Most people have a genuine respect for nurses,but may have outdated and somewhat unrealistic ideas of what nursing is today. Justas the profession advanced from shoveling coal and being the handmaiden of physi-cians to the very complex and technological career of today, the future holds evenmore promise. The possibilities are boundless for the professional nurse in the ever-changing fields that are developing in medicine. As noted even in the article aboutthe Integrative Medicine program at Hartford Hospital, the future is bright as weendeavor to provide more comprehensive care to our patients. Talk it up! Be positive! Whenever the opportunity arises, enlighten young people about the great rewards that await in a career as a professional nurse. So often whenI have done this, I have heard comments such as, \"I guess I never thought about it,\"or \"I'm not sure I'm smart enough to be a nurse.\" The focus should be on therewards if we are to be able to recruit these future professionals. Most of us chosenursing because we cared about people and wanted to help. Now it is time to \"help\"the profession of nursing. As our population ages, and the higher level of acuity of hospitalized patients places more demands on the clinical nurse, this crisis will worsen. Who will preparethese nurses to teach? Who will care for us when we need a nurse? In that spirit, the Alumnae Association of the Hartford Hospital School of Nursing has resolved to provide a nursing scholarship. The committee is now in the processof developing guidelines for deciding what qualifications will be required to apply for this financial aid. We hope that the Hartford Hospital School of NursingScholarship will assist a worthy student in pursuit of the professional educationrequired to be a nurse.

HARTFORD HOSPITAL NURSING / AUTUMN 2007Determined to SucceedAlumnae Spotlight Anne Crosby Peterson Jennings, RNC, SNP (HHSN '59), made history when shebecame the first African-American to beadmitted to the Hartford Hospital School ofNursing. It would not be the last time thedetermined lady would be a pioneer duringher career as a nurse. Born at Hartford Hospital, Anne grew up on Brown Street, only a few blocks fromHartford Hospital, and graduated fromBulkeley High School. At that time, her twoolder brothers were already in college, sothe family finances were somewhat tight.Anne obtained a state scholarship to defraythe cost of her training. She bravely blazeda new trail by applying to the HartfordHospital School of Nursing and becomingthe first African-American in its 79-year history to gain acceptance. The next three years were filled with challenges. America was a different place inthose pre-civil-rights-movement days, andAnne, like so many people of color, felt theundercurrents of racial prejudice. But shewas determined to succeed regardless. Shesays that the support of others was invalu-able. Hartford Hospital physician Donald B.Wells, MD, was a mentor to her and encouraged her to stay in school. Her fourolder brothers, all of whom earned under-graduate degrees and two of whom went onto advanced degrees, supported her. Andthe examples set by other women in herfamily were important. Her mother wassalutatorian of her class at Hartford HighSchool and attended Howard University.Her grandmother attended HamptonInstitute (where she met GeorgeWashington Carver). Plus, Anne remembers clearly the important role her fellow stu-dents played in helping her achieve her goal. \"I thought they were great!\" Anne says. \"I had wonderful support from my friends.I don't think I would have been able to dowhat I did if it hadn't been for them. Theywere great friends, and they still are.\"In Anne's junior year, a school adminis- trator expressed concern her passingher state board exams\u2014no HHSN studenthad ever failed\u2014and asked if she wouldconsider resigning and becoming an LPN. \"That was a challenge to me,\" Anne recalls. \"It gave me the impetus to stay inschool and not give up ... to be the bestpioneer African-American nurse and to bea role model for other black nurses.\" Looking back at her experience, Anne notes that the rigors of nurse's training areextremely demanding for a young womanjust out of high school. But the result, forher, was, \"You get the feeling you can gothrough anything\u2014through any adversi-ty\u2014because of what you went through,\"and, on graduation day, \"I felt very, veryproud that I was able to accomplish what I set out to do.\" For the next three decades, Anne pur- sued a varied and rewarding career as anurse. At Hartford Hospital, she worked asassistant head nurse in labor and deliveryand then as head of the specialty clinics forabout 10 years. She worked in Blue HillsHospital's alcohol and drug dependencyunit, the VD and young-adult clinics atBurgdorf Health Center, and at Model Cities, a day care program of the city of Hartford. For 19 years, she was a schoolnurse and, later, a certified school nursepractitioner with the Hartford Board ofEducation. When the University of Connecticut offered a program to educate school nursepractitioners, Anne's pioneering spirit ledher to seize the opportunity and enroll inthe program. On completion, she becameone of the first school nurse practitionerson the Eastern Seaboard. When the schoolnurse practitioner program closed at UConn, it became part of Yale's master'sprogram. Anne and her fellow UConn grad-uates were awarded Yale master's degrees.Her nurse practitionership resulted in a consulting role on the Test DevelopmentCommittee of the Washington, D.C.,-basedAmerican Nurses Credentialing Center.Later, she worked at the Times Farm Campand as a casework consultant at theConnecticut Peer Review. Shortly after Anne's retirement in 1991, her father, who lived on Martha's Vineyard,became seriously ill, and she moved thereto care for him. He died in 1993, but shestill lives there today. \"I really love it,\" she says of the Vineyard. \"It's a great healing place. It's a nice placeto relax, and friends come to visit me.\" She is proud to be a 66-year member of Hartford's Union Baptist Church and amember of the Martha's Vineyard NAACP .She would love to hear from former classmates. Reflecting on her time at the Hartford Hospital School of Nursing and her careeras a nurse, Anne says, \"It was a wonderfulexperience. I'm very satisfied with my life. I did something I wanted to do, and it'sbeen great.\" 12Anne Crosby Peterson Jennings, RNC, SNP (HHSN '59)13HARTFORD HOSPITAL NURSING / AUTUMN 2007A a teen, Stefanie Druzolowski Kaminski, RN (HHTS '38), spent summers workingat the Old People's Home on JeffersonStreet. She was eager to go into nurse'straining, but her father was opposed tothe idea. Fortunately, Helen Jones, whowas the superintendent of the OldPeople's Home, intervened. \"She talked my father into it,\" says Mrs. Kaminski. \"She had a good idea of what Iwas made of and what I could do. Shetold my father, 'You have to let her go. Sheloves nursing and will do well with it.'\"Soon, Mrs. Kaminski was a student in theHartford Hospital Training School. It wasa strict environment in those days, Mrs. Kaminski recalls. \"Our superintendent of nurses was a very rigid person,\" she says. \"Every morning, we went down to the meetingroom, sang a hymn and heard a talk. As we were filing out to go on duty, we each had to show that we had our pin andour bandage scissors. If you didn't have your scissors, youlost your privileges. If you were sitting down writing yourcharts and a doctor came onto the unit, you stood up, nomatter what.\" Some of the girls had trouble with the regimen, but Mrs. Kaminski was up to the challenge. Her father, who had toraise eight children by himself, ran a very tight ship, as well.Structure was nothing new to her, and she thrived. Hospital units, which usually had about 30 patients, were staffed by only a head nurse,an assistant head nurse andstudents. \"Students did everything, including cleaning bed pansand scrubbing the utilityroom,\" Mrs. Kaminski says.\"It was grueling. But that didn't bother me at all. I lovedevery minute of it.\" And, of course, the students had each other.\"We made such lovely friendships,\" she says. \"We banded together and triedto help one another. And we had loads offun. There was a little drug store on thecorner of Washington and Park. In theevening, a bunch of us would run over there and have a cherry Coke and a bun for15 cents.\" After graduation, Mrs. Kaminski did floor duty at Hartford Hospital for abouteight years, then transferred to the hospi-tal's Employee Health department, whereshe worked for 17 years. After years of covering all different shifts, it was a majorchange. \"Working 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and being off every week- end\u2014it was as if I were in a different world!\" she says.There were other major changes to get used to, as well,including suddenly being able to give out aspirin forheadache or cramps without a doctor's special order. When Mrs. Kaminski became the nurse in charge of Employee Health, the department had a half-time doctor anda half-time secretary. By the time she retired, 17 years later,she had two nurse practitioners, a full-time doctor and a full-time secretary, reflecting the hospital's growth in employment. Mrs. Kaminski was thrilled that her love of nursing was inherited by her daughter, Patricia Kaminski Robertson, who graduated from HHSN in 1962. Now 90, Mrs. Kaminski lives on herown and devotes hertime to, among otherthings, decorative painting, church andclub activities and mall-walking. \"I enjoy life,\" she says.
