This well-balanced blend of natural bitter botanicals and compounds powers antioxidant status and supports bile production and flow-a key aspect of healthy detoxification.

Detox Cleanse delivers comprehensive, end-to-end support for phased detoxification using state-of-the-art liposomal delivery technology. We masterfully combine the natural ingredients and house them in tiny lipid-based particles that are so small even light passes through them. These nanoparticles can passively diffuse through the body's cell membranes avoiding the breakdown of digestion for quick delivery and optimal effect of these powerful cleansing compounds. Quercetin: Quercetin is a plant pigment or flavonoid that is found naturally in many plants and foods, including apples, onions, berries, and green tea. Quercetin upregulates two key pathways; one called Nrf2, which turns up your internal antioxidant and detoxification chemistry, and another called AMPK, which improves metabolic health. Milk Thistle (Silymarin): Milk thistle is a flowering plant known for its liver support. It is rich in silymarin, a mixture of bioactive flavonoids including silybin, silydianin, and silychristin. Because the liver works tirelessly to orchestrate detoxification and metabolize toxins, it needs support. Milk thistle, a bitter herb, offers gentle, broad-based support to the liver, serving as a powerful plant ally in our modern, toxin-laden world. Dandelion Root and Leaf: A multi-faceted bitter herb, dandelion has been used for centuries for healthy digestion and detoxification. In detoxification, bitter herbs are an integral part of supporting the liver and kidneys. It does this by aiding bile production and flow. Dandelion also supports diuresis. Artichoke: The artichoke is a spiky member of the family with two powerful antioxidant constituents: cynarin and silymarin. Both have been shown to support gallbladders and aid bile production acting as stimulators for healthy digestion and detoxification activity.
