This includes the evasion from antibody mediated immune control by counteracting host Fc-gamma receptor (FcR) mediated immune control mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We have previously shown that HCMV avoids FcR activation by concomitant expression of the viral Fc-gamma-binding glycoproteins (vFcRs) gp34 and gp68. We now gp68 bind IgG simultaneously at topologically different Fc sites and achieve efficient antagonization of host FcR activation by distinct but synergizing mechanisms. While gp34 enhances immune complex internalization, gp68 acts as inhibitor of host FcR binding to immune complexes. In doing so, gp68 induces Fc accessibility to gp34 and simultaneously limits host FcR recognition. The synergy of gp34 and gp68 is compelled by the interfering influence of excessive non-immune IgG ligands and highlights conformational changes within the IgG globular chains critical for antibody effector function. eLife digest Human cytomegalovirus is a type of herpes virus that rarely causes symptoms in healthy people but can cause serious complications in unborn babies and in people with compromised immune systems, such as transplant recipients. The virus has found ways to successfully evade the immune system, and once infected, the body retains the virus for life. It deploys an arsenal of proteins that bind to antibodies, specialized proteins the immune system uses to flag virus-infected cells for destruction. This prevents certain cells of the immune system, the natural killer cells, from recognizing and destroying virus-infected cells. These immune-evading proteins are called viral Fc-gamma receptors, or vFcRs. While it has been previously shown that these receptors are able to evade the immune system, it remained unknown how exactly they prevent natural killer cells from recognizing infected cells. Now, Kolb et al. show that the cytomegalovirus deploys two vFcRs called gp34 and gp68, which work together to block natural killer cells. The latter reduces the ability of natural killer cells to bind to antibodies on cytomegalovirus-infected cells. This paves the way for gp34 to pull virus proteins from the surface of the infected cell, making them inaccessible to the immune system. Neither protein fully protects virus-infected cells on its own, but together they are highly effective. The experiments reveal further details about how cytomegalovirus uses two defense mechanisms simultaneously to outmaneuver the immune system. Understanding this two-part viral evasion system may help scientists to develop vaccines or new treatments that can protect vulnerable people from diseases caused by the cytomegalovirus. Introduction Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) constitutes the prototypical human pathogenic -herpesvirus found worldwide with high immunoglobulin G (IgG) sero-prevalence rates of 56-94% depending on the respective countries ( [Zuhair et al., 2019](#bib44)). A hallmark of cytomegalovirus infection is the establishment of a lifelong persistence with recurring phases of latency and reactivation of productive infection and horizontal spread in presence of adaptive immune responses. HCMV encodes the largest known transcriptome of human viruses ( [Stern-Ginossar et al., 2012](#bib38)), giving rise to an equally large antigenic proteome including a huge and varied arsenal of immunoevasins ( [Berry et al., 2020](#bib3); [Hengel et al., 1998](#bib17)) that counteract immune recognition of infected cells facilitating virus persistence, shedding, and superinfection of sero-positive hosts. While primary HCMV infection of healthy individuals usually remains undetected, it can cause severe symptoms in the immunocompromised. Besides antiviral therapy involving nucleotide analogs, concentrated HCMV-immune IgG preparations (e.g. Cytotect) are used to prevent infection of immunocompromised patients including the prevention of congenital infection in primary infected pregnant women with varying degrees of success ( [Kagan et al., 2019](#bib20); [Revello et al., 2014](#bib31)). Generally, HCMV is observed to withstand a humoral immunity even replicating and disseminating in the presence of highly neutralizing immune sera in vitro and clinical isolates of HCMV tend to disseminate via cell-to-cell spread, thus avoiding an encounter with neutralizing antibodies ( [Falk et al., 2018](#bib13)). This, however, cannot fully explain the resistance of HCMV to a humoral response leading to virus dissemination across several organs. Notably, HCMV encodes a set of Fc-binding glycoproteins (viral FcRs, vFcRs) that have been shown to antagonize host FcR activation by immune IgG ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b](#bib8)). In this previous showed that HCMV gp34, gp68 and HSV-1 gE/gI efficiently antagonize the activation of human FcRs. By attacking the conserved Fc part of IgG, HSV-1 and HCMV are able to counteract potent antiviral immune responses including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). As it has become increasingly evident that Fc mediated immune control is essential not only for the effectiveness of non-neutralizing but also neutralizing IgG antibodies 2017](#bib19); [Van den Hoecke et al., 2017](#bib41)), a mechanistic and causal analysis of this evasion process is highly warranted in the pursuit of better antibody based intervention strategies targeting herpesviruses and HCMV in particular. While several herpesviruses encode vFcRs, HCMV is the only virus known so far that encodes more than one individual molecule with the capacity to bind Fc. Specifically, HCMV encodes four distinct al., 2012](#bib9); [Sprague al., 2008](#bib35)). Turning to other species, mouse CMV (MCMV) encoded m138 has been shown to bind Fc, yet it has more prominently been associated with a variety of unrelated functions proving m138 not to be a strict homolog of the HCMV counterparts ( [Arapovi et al., found Rhesus CMV (RhCMV) to encode an Fc-binding protein in the Rh05 gene (RL11 gene family) seemingly more closely related to its HCMV analog ( [Kolb et al., 2019](#bib21)). This is supported by the fact that gpRh05, as HCMV vFcRs gp34 and gp68, is able to generically antagonize activation of all macaque FcRs. While it is clear that by targeting the invariant part of the key molecule of the humoral immune response, vFcRs have the potential to manipulate a multitude of antibody mediated immune functions, their role in vivo has yet to be determined. While the function of HCMV vFcRs gp34 and gp68 as antagonists of host FcRs has been established ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b](#bib8)), the underlying mechanism(s) had not been addressed yet. In recent years it has been shown that gp68 and gp34 are able to engage in antibody bipolar bridging (ABB) forming ternary complexes consisting of antigen, antibody, and vFcR ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014a](#bib7); et al., 2008](#bib35)). Moreover, gp68 has been shown to bind IgG in a 2:1 ratio and has the ability to internalize and translocate IgG to lysosomal compartments, while gp34 has been shown to form predominantly homo-dimeric structures ( [Ndjamen et al., 2016](#bib28); [Sprague et al., 2008](#bib35)). However, no studies have yet been performed in the context of HCMV infection investigating the coincident disposition of gp34 and gp68 at the plasma membrane and their functional interaction during the early and late phase of HCMV replication. Here, we show gp34 and gp68 to antagonize host FcR activation by distinct but highly cooperative modes of Fc targeting, leading to efficient evasion from antibody mediated immune control by division of labor. Results gp34 and gp68 simultaneously bind to distinct regions on IgG. gp68 binding to IgG has been mapped to the interdomain region of Fc ( [Sprague et al., 2008](#bib35)). Accordingly, in a first experiment we set out to narrow down the contact site of gp34 on IgG utilizing a methodology previously used to characterize HSV-1 gE and HCMV gp68 ( [Sprague et al., 2004](#bib34); et al., 2008](#bib35)). To this end we infected CV-1 cells with recombinant vaccinia viruses (rVACV) encoding proteins were precipitated from cell lysates using CNBr-Sepharose coupled with human IgG1-Fc in its wild-type form (wtFc) or as a mutated variant (nbFc) with a scrambled CH2-CH3 interdomain amino acid sequence designed and provided by P. Bjorkman (Caltech, California, USA) ( [Sprague et al., 2004](#bib34); [Sprague et al., 2008](#bib35)). Expectedly, was only able to bind wtFc but not nbFc whereas gp34, comparable to human FcRI, binding to both wtFc and nbFc ( [Figure 1A](#fig1)). While the high affinity FcRI does not require the CH2-CH3 region to bind to the lower hinge of IgG, FcRIIA and FcRIII show lower affinity to monomeric IgG and utilize additional distinct residues for binding to Fc, which include the CH2 region adjacent to the lower hinge region of IgG ( [Shields et al., 2001](#bib33); nbFc ( [Figure 1A](#fig1)). Since gp34 showed intact binding similar host FcRI but not FcRIIA we surmised that gp34 binding involves the hinge region of monomeric IgG. To validate this assumption further gp34 binding to a variant form of hIgG1 with point mutations in the lower hinge region (Leu234Ala and Leu235Ala, named LALA) exhibiting deficient interaction with human FcRs ( [Hessell et al., gp120 or a B12-LALA variant. PGS-precipitation of FcRI/CD64, exclusively recognizing the hinge region on IgG, was almost abrogated by the mutations in the LALA variant. Similarly, gp34 was sensitive to the mutations, albeit to a lower extent than FcRI/CD64. As expected, the interaction of gp68 with B12 was unaffected by the LALA point mutations. Next, as gp34 and gp68 recognize non-overlapping regions on IgG we set out to test, if both molecules are able to simultaneously associate with IgG. To this end, we generated C-terminal His- or strep-tagged variants of gp34 and gp68 respective and cytosolic domains (soluble gp34 and gp68, or sgp34 and sgp68). These proteins were produced by transfected 293 T cells and secreted into Supernatants humanized anti-hCD20 (Rituximab, Rtx) before being non-Fc-binding point mutant of sgp34 (sgp34mtrp, W65F mutation) was identified and used as a control molecule ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/63877/figures#fig1s2)). When precipitating His-tagged of monomeric IgG, we sgp34mtrp ( [Figure 1C](#fig1)). To further substantiate this observation, we designed an ELISA based setup using the same supernatants as above and performed the assay as depicted schematically in [Figure 1D](#fig1). In brief, titrated amounts of IgA isotype and incubated with His6-tagged sgp68 followed by detection with an anti-His-HRP antibody. Here, we observed dose-dependent binding of sgp68 to titrated amounts of immobilized sgp34. sgp68 could only be detected in the presence of IgG1 but not IgA. Furthermore, sgp68 binding in the presence of IgG1 and sgp34mtrp in this setup does not exceed background levels. Taken together, we conclude that gp34 and gp68 are able to simultaneously bind to IgG with gp34 binding to the upper hinge region and gp68 binding to the CH2-CH3 interface domain (UL119-118) been shown to antagonize FcR activation independently ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b](#bib8)). As gp34 and gp68 appear to have a redundant inhibitory function and are able to simultaneously bind to IgG we utilized a previously established FcR activation assay ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2013](#bib6)) to assess their ability to antagonize FcR activation individually or in combination. In brief, MRC-5 or human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) were infected with HCMV AD169-pBAC2-derived mutant viruses different combinations of vFcRs. The other vFcRs gp95 (RL12) and gpRL13 RL13 ( [Cortese et al., 2012](#bib9)), a replication ( [Stanton et al., 2010](#bib37)), is notoriously mutated or absent from the HCMV genome in cell culture passages ( [Dargan et al., 2010](#bib10)) but has not yet been described to antagonize FcR activation. RL12 is one of the most polymorphic genes of HCMV ( [Dolan et al., 2004](#bib12)) with only minor surface expression in the context of AD169 infection ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b](#bib8)). Due to remarkably low conservation of RL12 across HCMV strains, we focused on the well-conserved and previously described vFcRs gp34 and gp68. Infected cells were incubated with a HCMV-IgG hyperimmunoglobulin preparation (Cytotect) and co-cultured with BW5147 reporter cells expressing human FcRIIIA as a chimeric molecule providing the ectodomain of the FcR fused to the transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail of mouse CD3 ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2013](#bib6)). In response to FcR activation, reporter cells secrete mIL-2 which was then quantified by ELISA ( [Corrales-Aguilar et 2013](#bib6)), assay schematically shown in [Figure 1](/articles/63877/figures#fig2s1). In with previously published observations ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b](#bib8)) we found that FcRIIIA activation is antagonized efficiently by a virus co-expressing both gp34 and gp68 while viruses expressing either gp34 or gp68 show only minor or no antagonistic potential when compared with a mutant lacking all vFcRs ( [Figure 2A](#fig2)). The extent of FcR under curve (AUC) comparisons ( [Figure 2A](#fig2) bottom panel). This showed no statistically significant effect for singular vFcRs, but a strong and significant antagonization by both vFcRs in combination. To further confirm this key finding we measured degranulation of primary NK cells in response to vFcR expression to assess antagonization of ADCC. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from three donors were incubated with HCMV-infected opsonized human fibroblasts generated as above and CD107a positivity of NK cells was measured after 6 hr of co-culture. In line with the reporter cell assay, primary NK cell activation in response to target cells decorated with anti-HCMV antibodies was antagonized by a virus expressing both gp34 and gp68 with high significance, while the mutant viruses lacking gp34 or gp68 showed drastically lower antagonistic potential ( [Figure 2B](#fig2)). From these observations we conclude that gp34 and gp68 antagonize FcRs by synergizing modes of action, suggesting cooperation, at least in the absence of gp95 As we observed gp34 and gp68 to work in concert to maximize FcR inhibition, we set out to elucidate the mechanisms by which the vFcRs achieve this synergistic effect. When comparing the amino acid sequences of the cytosolic domains of gp34 and gp68 it is revealed that both molecules encode distinct sorting motifs ( [Figure 3A](#fig3); tail of gp68 harbors an YXX motif seven aa downstream of the transmembrane domain. Such a motif has been described as a marker for lysosomal targeting ( [Bonifacino and Traub, 2003](#bib4)) and is in line with the lysosomal translocation of gp68 shown in a previous study ( et al., 2008](#bib35)). In HCMV gB, a non-Fc-binding HCMV encoded envelope glycoprotein, the location of two such motifs is further away from the transmembrane domain indicating it being destined for general endocytosis rather than immediate degradation, which is shared by another HCMV vFcR, gpRL13, found primarily in intracellular compartments as well as HSV-1 gE, forming a heterodimeric gE/gI vFcR described to internalize IgG and recycle back the cell surface ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2016](#bib28); tail of gp34 encodes a di-leucine [D/E]XXX[LL/LI] motif which we find to be unique among surface-resident vFcRs. Therefore we suspected gp34 and gp68 to possess different dynamics regarding IC internalization. As internalization studies in the context of HCMV infection proved not to be feasible due to lacking gp34- and gp68-specific antibodies for tracing, we aimed to establish a gain-of-function cell-based experimental model. To this end, we characterized the surface dynamics of vFcR expressing transfected 293 T cells stably expressing a model antigen (hCD20) recognized by Rituximab (RTX). In order to manipulate internalization, we chose to replace the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of gp34 and gp68 with the according sequences from human CD4 (hCD4) as it contains a non-canonical sorting motif (SQIKRLL) in its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CD4-tailed). To be recognized by AP-2 the serine residue upstream of the di-leucine motif in hCD4 needs to be phosphorylated in order to mimic the negatively charged glutamate or aspartate residues of a classical di-leucine motif ( [Pitcher et al., 1999](#bib29)). In a first experiment we ensured equal expression of the transfected constructs utilizing the polycistronic expression of GFP from a pIRES_eGFP expression vector to gate on transfected cells ( [Figure 3B](#fig3)). GFP-positive cells were also detected for Fc binding by a surface stain using a PE-TexasRed conjugated human Fc fragment ( [Figure 3C](#fig3)). This revealed that upon recombinant expression, surface exposition of Fc binding gp68 is drastically increased when CD4-tailed although overall protein expression was comparable and all constructs bear original signal peptides ( [Figure 3B](#fig3)). This can be attributed to the abrogation of its internalization evidenced by the fact that internalization of complete IC was drastically reduced with CD4-tailed gp68 when tracking hCD20/Rtx ICs [Figure 3D](#fig3)). Conversely, while gp34 showed only mild differences in surface exposition when altered in the same way ( [Figure 3C](#fig3)), it proved to rapidly internalize complete Rtx-CD20 IC only with its native cytosolic tail intact ( [Figure 3D](#fig3)). Given ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/63877/figures#fig3s2)), this could hint at different routes of trafficking following internalization. Specifically, as it has been shown that gp68 internalizes IgG-Fc translocating to the lysosomal compartment for degradation [Ndjamen et al., 2016](#bib28)), the difference seen for gp34 here suggests a recycling route as described for HSV-1 gE/gI ( [Ndjamen et al., 2014](#bib27)). Further, while we also observe gp34 to more efficiently internalize even non-immune IgG, the still rapid internalization of non-immune IgG by gp68 seems not to translate to the internalization of IC regarding efficiency ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/63877/figures#fig3s2)), again in line with a previously published observation ( [Ndjamen et al., 2016](#bib28)). As we observed significantly more efficient internalization of IC by gp34wt major task of gp34 compared to gp68 is mediating the efficient internalization of IC, a feature likely linked to its particular di-leucine cytosolic motif. [see all](/articles/63877/figures#fig3) FcRIII binding to opsonized cells is reduced in the presence of gp68 but not gp34 As previously reported ( [Atalay et al., 2002](#bib2); [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b](#bib8)) and confirmed in this study, we find that in the context of HCMV infection gp68 is more surface resident compared to gp34 (Figure 6A). Therefore, we next set out to test if the antagonizing effect of membrane-resident gp68 on FcR activation can be attributed to a block of host FcR binding to cell surface IC rather than IC internalization. To test this hypothesis, we established a flow cytometry based assay using using soluble His-tagged ectodomains of human FcRs, which and compared gp34 and gp68 regarding their ability to interfere with FcR binding to cell surface IC. Advantageously, CD4-tailed vFcRs, besides circumventing confounding effects of internalization on our binding assay, closely mimic the relative surface density of gp34 and gp68 found on the plasma membrane of an HCMV-infected cell judged by human Fc 5A](#fig5); [Corrales-Aguilar et al., To equal density of antigen upon recombinant vFcR expression, CD20 levels were directly measured and found only in the case of CD99 expression to be slightly reduced, which served as a non-Fc-binding control molecule ( [Figure 4A](#fig4)). We found gp68 but not gp34 to significantly reduce binding of FcRIIIA to cell surface immune complexes compared to CD99 ( [Figure 4C](#fig4)). This finding can be explained with certain CH2-CH3 region residues of IgG playing a subordinate, yet significant role in FcRIII binding to IgG ( [Shields et al., 2001](#bib33)). Additionally, we found the effect of gp68 to be dependent on the accessibility of the CH2-CH3 interface region on IgG as pre-incubation with Protein G prevented the inhibition by gp68 and fully restored FcRIIIA binding to Rtx ( [Figure 4C](#fig4)). These observations further narrow down the binding region of gp68 to involve the above-mentioned residues as opposed to Protein G which has been shown to not interact with these residues ( [Sauer-Eriksson et al., 1995](#bib32)). Finally, this conclusion is further substantiated by our observation that FcRI, which binds to IgG independently of the above-mentioned residues in the CH2-CH3 interdomain region ( [Shields et cells is reduced by viral gp68 In order to test if our previous findings regarding the block of human FcRIII binding to immune complexes in the presence of gp68 translate into a loss-of-function approach, MRC-5 cells were infected with AD169/pBAC2-derived HCMV mutants as described above. Uniformity of HCMV antigen expression and differential surface Fc binding indicating vFcR expression between the different virus mutants was assured using a F(ab')2 preparation of purified human IgG containing HCMV-specific IgG, Cytotect, or a conjugated respectively ( [Figure 5A](#fig5)). FcR binding to opsonized-infected cells was detected by flow cytometry as described above and schematically depicted in [Figure 5B](#fig5). Expectedly, as we observed stronger Fc binding to cells infected with gp68 proficient viruses compared to a gp34 expressing virus ( [Figure 5A](#fig5)), we also found more total IgG bound to the surface of cells infected with a gp68 expressing HCMV virus compared to a gp34 expressing virus ( [Figure 5C](#fig5), upper panel). Along these gp68-bound non-immune IgG ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/63877/figures#fig5s1)), albeit rate compared to immune IgG ( [Figure 4](#fig4)) in line with toward antigen-bound IgG ( [Bruhns et al., 2009](#bib5)). As the Cytotect formulation contains an abundance of non-immune IgG, binding of host FcR ectodomains as shown exemplarily in [Figure 5C](#fig5) (lower panel) was normalized to levels of total surface bound IgG within each experiment ( [Figure 5C](#fig5), upper panel). Evaluating the results from three independent experiments performed with independent virus preparations confirmed a strong relative reduction in FcRIIIA binding to opsonized HCMV-infected cells in the presence of gp68, but not gp34 ( [Figure 5D](#fig5)). This finding is line with our previous gain-of-function experiments ( [Figure 4C](#fig4)) again showing an approximate 60% reduction in FcRIII binding. While not further elaborated on in this study, we also measured binding of FcRs I, IIA, and IIB/C in the same setup and observed that binding of FcRI was only slightly reduced in the presence of either vFcR, but clearly reduced in the presence of both molecules. Conversely, gp68 showed a similar effect on FcRs IIA and observed for FcRIII ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/63877/figures#fig5s2)). This indicates a mechanism of gp68 on FcRs IIA and IIB/C but shows again FcRI to be more resistant to gp68. Cooperative antagonization of FcR activation is achieved by combining gp68-mediated block of FcR binding and subsequent gp34 internalization While we delineated distinct mechanisms by which gp34 or gp68 are able to counteract FcRII/III activation, we did not observe efficient antagonization of FcR function by gp34 or gp68 individually in the context of HCMV deletion mutant infection ( [Figure 2](#fig2)). Therefore, we next wanted to test the antagonistic potential of gp68 or gp34 individually in the absence of non-immune IgG and in a gain-of-function setting. To this end, we conducted an FcR activation assay with Hela cells co-transfected with Her2 as a model antigen and the indicated vFcRs followed by incubation gp34 individually confirmed to antagonize FcRIII activation. However, the more membrane resident gp68-CD4 showed a markedly stronger antagonistic effect compared to gp68wt, indicating a more prominent membrane-residence of gp68 to be beneficial regarding evasion from FcR recognition despite its lower capacity to internalize ICs ( [Figure 3D](#fig3)). Conversely, when comparing unaltered gp34 to its less internalized gp34-CD4 variant we observed an opposite effect indicating internalization to be a major condition of gp34 driven antagonization of FcR activation. Next, in an approach mimicking HCMV immune sera we tested if the addition of IgG impairs the antagonization of FcR activation by gp34 we added 10 \u00b5g/ml TNF-specific Infliximab (Ifx) IgG1 given concomitantly with the graded amounts of Hc IgG1 ( [Figure 6B](#fig6)). This showed that indeed the presence of an excess of non-immune IgG interferes with both gp68 and dose-dependent manner. As ultrapure monomeric IgG does not activate the reporter cells on its own, shown by the samples that were treated only with Ifx but not Hc, this effect can be attributed to displacement of immune IgG from the vFcRs resulting in restoration of FcRIII activation. Synergism between gp34 and gp68 was [Figure 6B](#fig6), right panel) indicating that vFcRs are particularly adapted to work in the presence of excess non-immune IgG, supporting our previous observation with human hyperimmunoglobulin Cytotect (see [Figure 2](#fig2)). On the other hand, host FcRs have been shown to bind IgG immune complexes with a higher affinity compared to monomeric IgG ( [Bruhns et al., monomeric IgG in attenuating FcR activation. Finally, we addressed cooperative antagonization by gp34 and gp68 in a loss-of-function approach in the context of HCMV infection. When using the humanized anti-HCMV mAb MSL-109 targeting HCMV gH, we found that low gH levels expressed on the surface of HCMV-AD169-infected cell are insufficient to detect FcR triggering ( [Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/63877/figures#fig6s1)). To overcome this experimental problem, we generated Her2-expressing BJ fibroblasts exhibiting high levels of Her2 on the surface. Infected Her2 BJ fibroblasts were opsonized with titrated amounts of Herceptin were analyzed by FcRIIIA reporter cells ( [Figure 6C](#fig6)). Although not statistically significant, this approach clearly demonstrated that compared to our observations with hyperimmunoglobulin Cytotect (see [Figure 2](#fig2)), natively expressed gp34 as well as gp68 are able to antagonize FcRIIIA activation individually. When both vFcRs were expressed by HCMV-infected cells, a markedly stronger antagonistic effect was seen (p=0.0252). [see all](/articles/63877/figures#fig6) - Figure 6\u2014source data 1 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/63877/elife-63877-fig6-data1-v2.xlsx](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/63877/elife-63877-fig6-data1-v2.xlsx) - Figure 6\u2014source data 2 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/63877/elife-63877-fig6-data2-v2.xlsx](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/63877/elife-63877-fig6-data2-v2.xlsx) - Figure 6\u2014source data 3 - [https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/63877/elife-63877-fig6-data3-v2.xlsx](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/63877/elife-63877-fig6-data3-v2.xlsx) Following the reveal of synergistic modes of action, we next explored cooperativity between gp34 and gp68 in a setup of reduced complexity. Specifically, in order to elaborate on the cooperativity of gp34 and gp68 regarding the here highlighted main mechanisms of internalization (gp34) and host FcR-binding blockade (gp68) we chose to soluble gp68 (sgp68, 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/63877/figures#fig1s1)), or a soluble functional gp34 point mutant as a control (sgp34mtrp, [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/63877/figures#fig1s1) and [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/63877/figures#fig1s2)), together with the reporter cells after the removal of unbound Hc. Here we observe that the ectodomain of gp68 is sufficient to enhance the antagonistic effect of gp34 ( [Figure 6C](#fig6)). In summary, we conclude that (i) gp34 is designed for internalization of IC while gp68 blocks FcR binding to IC; (ii) gp34 and gp68 are able to antagonize FcR activation individually when faced with titrated amounts of immune IgG, but non-immune IgG interferes with gp68 show cooperativity in attenuating FcR activation particularly under conditions of high excess of non-immune IgG. Discussion Here we delineate for the first time synergistic modes of action involving two independent viral factors to efficiently achieve evasion from antibody-mediated immune cell surveillance ( [Figure 7](#fig7)). The novelty of these mechanisms acting cooperatively on the surface of an infected cell has major implications for our perception of how viruses have co-evolved multifactorial strategies to compete in a molecular arms race with the host at the junction between adaptive (humoral) and innate immunity. In particular, this knowledge refines our understanding of how HCMV can efficiently evade from a fully developed, broadly polyclonal and affinity-matured IgG response using its large coding capacity to ensure its reactivation, shedding, spread, and eventually transmission. Recognizing the conserved Fc part of IgG and exhibiting a very antagonization profile in reductionistic gain-of-function and gp68 (UL119-118) appeared at first glance merely redundant. This left the puzzling question as to why HCMV (and cytomegaloviruses in general) have developed a whole arsenal of antagonists, unlike other viral and microbial pathogens with only singular Fc-binding [Falugi et al., 2013](#bib14)). However, when carefully examining their effect in a loss-of-function approach based on opsonized cells infected with a complete set of targeted HCMV gene deletion mutants, we convinced ourselves that gp34 and gp68 actually depend on one another to efficiently antagonize NK cell degranulation ( [Figure 2](#fig2)). This is explained by a number of individual features of gp34 and gp68 that only in conjunction can amount to antagonistic efficiency. gp34 efficiently internalizes IC While we find both, gp34 and gp68, able to internalize monomeric gp68 ( [Figure 3](#fig3)). Consequently exchange of the cytosolic domain of gp34 leads to strongly reduced internalization and subsequently to a reduction in FcR antagonization ( [Figure 6](#fig6)). Looking closely at the cytosolic all identified cytomegalovirus vFcRs reveals a unique [D/E]XXX[LL/LI] cytosolic the HCMV and gpRL13 all share only a as the recently identified RhCMV encoded vFcR gpRH05 (RL11 gene family) and its homologs which are conserved in Old World monkey CMV species ( [Kolb et al., 2019](#bib21)). Further comparing the cytosolic sorting motifs between other membrane-resident glycoproteins of HCMV it seems that the YXX motif of gp68 fulfills a more general purpose of limiting the overall surface exposure of concerned HCMV antigens (examples listed in [Figure 3\u2014figure 2014b](#bib8); 2016](#bib28)). While the YXX motif of gp68 lies within seven aa distance to the transmembrane domain, in line with it being translocated to lysosomal compartments ( [Bonifacino and Traub, 2003](#bib4); [Ndjamen et al., 2016](#bib28)), the YXX motif is additionally linked to specific targeting functions. For example, HSV-1 gE has been shown to bind in a pH-dependent manner not observed for any other HCMV encoded vFcR ( [Sprague et al., 2004](#bib34); [Sprague et al., 2008](#bib35)) which fits to it being destined for recycling rather than degradation ( [Ndjamen et al., 2014](#bib27)). This is in line with its YXX motif being more distant to its transmembrane domain within around seven amino acids ( [Bonifacino 2003](#bib4); [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement motifs in the cytosolic domains of HCMV encoded gpRL13 and gB, but not the model antigen Her2 which we explored in [Figure 6C](#fig6), perhaps explaining the limited synergistic inhibition that was observed. These findings highlight the di-leucine motif found in gp34 to be unique among other surface-resident glycoproteins expressed by HCMV and all other vFcRs known CMV family members RhCMV and [Kolb et al., 2019](#bib21); [Th\u00e4le et al., 1994](#bib39)). It remains to be explored as to what the further consequences of this seemingly unique internalization route is. However, as we also find gp34 to be incorporated into the virion ( [Reinhard, 2010](#bib30)) it is tempting to speculate that the potent internalization of IC via gp34 has an additional role besides evasion from antibody-mediated attack of an infected cell. gp68 blocks binding of FcRs II and III to IC Although we find gp34 to efficiently internalize ICs from the cell surface, it does not manipulate host FcR binding to ICs. This is remarkable given our data showing that gp34 binds to the hinge region of monomeric IgG, but implying that gp34 is not able to directly compete with host FcRs for binding to IC on the plasma membrane when co-expressed with a target antigen. Conversely, gp68 binding to the CH2-CH3 interface domain also occupies a region on Fc that includes residues involved in FcRII and FcRIII binding to Fc ( [Shields et al., 2001](#bib33); [Sprague et al., 2008](#bib35)). This could explain the ability of gp68 to efficiently limit binding of FcRs II and III to cell surface IC without directly competing for a shared binding region at the hinge region ( [Figure 1](#fig1), [Figures 4](#fig4) and [5](#fig5)). The the above-mentioned residues on IgG regarding FcRIII binding further ties into the observation that the blocking effect of gp68 is not total but more in line with the reported reduction of FcRIII binding to IgG being approximately 40-70% when these residues are manipulated ( [Shields et al., 2001](#bib33)). Conversely, gp68 not showing a similar efficiency in blocking FcRI binding to IC further supports this conclusion as FcRI binding does not require the above mentioned CH2-CH3 region residues ( [Figure gp68 cooperatively antagonize FcR activation Taken together, we conclude that neither gp68 nor gp34 individually are able to efficiently antagonize FcR activation by IgG-opsonized viral antigens in the physiological context of HCMV infection ( [Figure 2](#fig2)), that is, in the inhibitory potential ( [Figure 6C](#fig6)). Our data provide evidence that gp68 rather functions to increase IC accessibility to gp34 leading to efficient internalization of IC, presumably by a repeating process of gp34 recycling. This is supported by our observation that the ectodomain of gp68 is sufficient to increase the antagonistic efficiency of gp34 regarding FcR activation ( [Figure 6](#fig6)). Further, gp34 and gp68 are co-expressed at the cell surface throughout the protracted HCMV replication cycle and show simultaneous Fc binding ( [Figure 1](#fig1)). Our findings imply that gp68 binding, as it does not use the same region as host FcRs, evolved to ensure a consistent and evolutionary less vulnerable way of shifting Fc accessibility in favor of gp34. The idea that gp68 has not evolved to directly compete with host receptors for IgG binding is also supported by the finding demonstrating gp68 to possess a lower affinity to Fc when binding in a 2:1 ratio compared to host FcRIIIA (KD1:470 nM and al., 2008](#bib35)). The concept of gp68 driven accessibility shift also does not require gp68 to completely block FcR binding to IC as subsequent gp34-driven internalization is a continuous and fast process. Beyond NK cells In this study we mainly focused on the mechanisms by which gp34 and gp68 cooperate to antagonize CD16/FcRIII as the primary receptor on NK cells associated with ADCC, one of the most powerful mechanisms of antibody-mediated virus control. However, it is already known that HCMV vFcRs also antagonize activation of ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b](#bib8)) observed antagonization of the only inhibitory FcR, FcRIIB (unpublished observation). Similarly, we could recently of all canonical Rhesus FcRs I, gene family) ( [Kolb et al., 2019](#bib21)). Taken together with the data shown in this study that the underlying mechanism seems to be related between FcRs IIA/B and III, we also speculate that more Fc-binding host factors might be antagonized by similar mechanisms involving vFcRs. In support of this view, besides gp34 and gp68, HCMV and RL13 (gpRL13) likely are part of a larger arsenal of antibody targeting immunoevasins ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014a](#bib7); [Cortese et al., 2012](#bib9)). The fact that the interaction of gp34 and gp68 was analyzed in the absence of gp95 (RL12) and gpRL13 (RL13) is a major limitation of our study. Synergies between other or even all four vFcRs are also conceivable and subject to further investigation. Altogether, our findings analyze the first mechanistic details of HCMV evasion from antibody-mediated control utilizing its vFcR toolset. This deeper insight into the inner workings of such a process has consequences for the future evaluation and optimization of antibody-based treatment strategies targeting HCMV disease. In particular, our data will support the development of targeted intervention strategies that neutralize the function of gp34 and gp68, to increase the efficiency of IVIg treatment in the future.

Her2 antigen was acquired from Addgene (pCDNA3). CD99 cloned into pIRES_eGFP via Nhe1 and BamH1 restriction sites. Flanking restriction sites were introduced via PCR (Primers: IDT). GOI-internal BamH1 sites were removed by silent substitutions during gBlock design. Recombinant vaccinia virus (rVACV) [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap63877?item=s4-3) The construction of the rVACVs has been described before ( [Atalay et al., 2002](#bib2); [Sprague et al., 2008](#bib35); [Staib et al., 2004](#bib36)). In brief, the gene of interest inserted in the vaccinia virus recombination vector p7.5k131a was transferred into the thymidine kinase open reading frame of the virus genome (strain Copenhagen). rVACVs were selected protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap63877?item=s4-4) Metabolic labeling using Easytag Express [35S]-Met/Cys protein labeling, Perkin Elmer with 100 Ci/ml for 2 hr, and immunoprecipitation of Fc fragments using CNBr-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was performed as described previously ( [Sprague et al., 2008](#bib35)). Generation and purification of human Fc fragments wtFc and nbFc are described elsewhere ( [Sprague al., 2004](#bib34)). In brief, wild-type and mutant IgG Fc proteins were collected from CHO cell supernatants and purified using Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography followed by pH sensitive FcRn-Sepharose column separation and subsequent size exclusion chromatography. B12 and B12-LALA were kind gifts from Ann Hessell ( [Hessell et al., 2007](#bib18)). Direct IgG precipitation was performed using Protein G Sepharose (Amersham). Samples were de-glycosylated using EndoH (NEB, as suggested by the supplier). Production of soluble HCMV vFcRs [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap63877?item=s4-5) Expression constructs encoding tagged HCMV vFcR constructs lacking their respective transmembrane and cytosolic domains were generated as described elsewhere ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014b](#bib8)). Soluble C-terminally V5-His-tagged vFcR molecules were produced by transfection of 293 T cells in a 10 cm dish format and covered with 7 ml of DMEM/5% FCS. 3 days post transfection the supernatants were harvested, centrifuged (11,000 g, 30 min), and used directly or stored in 1 ml aliquots at 20\u00b0C. Production of soluble vFcRs was controlled via immunoblot. Generation of HCMV detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap63877?item=s4-6) Recombinant HCMV mutants were generated according to previously published procedures ( [Tischer et al., 2006](#bib40); [Wagner et al., 2011](#bib22)) as parental genome. For the construction of the HCMV deletion mutants, a PCR fragment was generated using the plasmid pSLFRTKn ( [Atalay et al., 2002](#bib2)) as the template DNA. The PCR fragment containing a kanamycin resistance gene was inserted into the parental BAC by homologous recombination in E. coli. The inserted cassette replaces the target sequence which was defined by flanking sequences in the primers. This cassette is flanked by frt-sites which can be used to remove the kanamycin resistance gene by FLP-mediated recombination. The removal of the cassette results in a single remaining frt-site. The deletion of multiple non-adjacent genes was conducted in consecutive steps. The gene TRL11 was deleted by use of the primers KL-DeltaTRL11-Kana1 (ACGACGAAGAGGACGAGGACGACAACGTCTGATAAGGAAGGCGAGAACGTGTTTTGCACCCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTAC) and KL-DeltaTRL11-Kana2 (TGTATACGCCGTATGCCTGTACGTGAGATGGTGAGGTCTTCGGCAGGCGACACGCATCTTGACCATGATTACGCCAAGCTCC). The gene of primers KL-DeltaTRL12-Kana1 (CGGACGGACCTAGATACGGAACCTTTGTTGTTGACGGTGGACGGGGATTTACAGTAAAAGCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTAC) and KL-DeltaTRL12-Kana2 (CCTTACAGAATGTTTTAGTTTATTGTTCAGCTTCATAAGATGTCTGCCCGGAAACGTAGCGACCATGATTACGCCAAGCTCC). The gene vFcR supernatants were mixed 1:1 in the presence of 1 \u00b5g Rituximab. Antibody has to be given in a limiting amount to increase the probability of simultaneous binding to the same IgG molecule. Samples were incubated 1 hr at 4\u00b0C and then mixed with freshly prepared Ni2+-NTA Sepharose beads (2 \u00b5l BV, cOmplete His-Tag purification resin) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C in the presence of 20 mM Imidazole (rotate or shake). Beads were washed three times with PBS/20 mM Imidazole at 11,000 g and 4\u00b0C. After the final wash, beads were either resuspended in sample buffer (Tris pH 6.8, SDS, Glycerol, 2-mercaproethanol, bromophenol blue) or subjected to a PNGase F digest before being supplemented with sample buffer (NEB, performed as suggested by the supplier). Samples were then denatured at 95\u00b0C and analyzed via SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblot. vFcR-binding ELISA [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap63877?item=s4-8) We adapted a standard ELISA protocol to measure binding between soluble vFcRs and target IgG. 96-well Nunc Maxisorp plates were coated with 1 \u00b5g of biotin in PBS. Plates were then blocked and incubated with titrated amounts of supernatants from soluble strep-tagged vFcR producing cells (1\u00b0 vFcRs). Supernatants were diluted in PBS. After incubation with 100 ng/well of target antibody, plates were incubated with a 2\u00b0 His-tagged soluble vFcR (1:2 diluted) followed by detection using a HRP-conjugated anti-His antibody. Plates were measured using a Tecan Genios Pro microtiter plate reader at 450 nm/630 nm. Plates were washed three times between steps Tw-20.

Harvested cells were washed in PBS, equilibrated in staining buffer (PBS, 3% FCS) and sedimented at 1000 g and 10\u00b0C for 3 min. Cells were then incubated with staining buffer containing rituximab, Cytotect, or herceptin. Cells were then incubated in an adequate volume of staining buffer containing either mAbs, Fc fragment, or FcR ectodomains min, 4\u00b0C). Human His-tagged FcR ectodomains were used at a final of \u00b5g/ml (1:50 dilution from reconstituted 0.25 mg/ml with G incubation with FcR ectodomains (diluted 1:100). Further incubation steps were carried out at 4\u00b0C for 1 hr and followed by three washing steps in staining buffer. Dead cells were excluded via DAPI stain. Analysis was performed on a FACS Fortessa harvested using Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich) to retain surface molecules upon detachment. Harvested cells were incubated with Rituximab (1 \u00b5g/well) for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C in medium. Cells were then washed twice in medium containing 5% FCS and seeded into a 96-well plate at 2 \u00d7 104 cells/well. Each reaction was performed on cells from one 96-well. Cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere until being harvested at different time points ensuring regular re-suspension to avoid cell attachment over longer periods of time. After harvesting, cells were directly stained with human-IgG-PE for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C and fixed using 3% PFA. Analysis was performed performed as described earlier ( [Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2013](#bib6)). Briefly, target cells were incubated with titrated amounts of antibody (96-well format) in medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FCS for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. Cells were washed with medium (RPMI) and co-cultured with BW5147-reporter cells (ratio E:T 20:1) expressing individual host FcyR ectodomains or CD99 as control for 16 hr at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.

Acceptance summary: This work gives important novel insights into immune evasion strategies by Human Cytomegalovirus with a focus on evasion from antibody mediated immune control. The authors show that HCMV counteracts Fc-gamma receptor (FcR) mediated immune control Fc-gamma binding glycoproteins (vFcRs) gp34 and gp68. Those viral proteins bind IgG simultaneously at topologically different Fc sites, and thereby efficiently antagonize FcR activation of the host. Decision letter after peer review: Thank you for submitting your article \"Human Cytomegalovirus antagonizes activation of Fc receptors by distinct and synergizing modes of IgG manipulation\" for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and P\u00e4ivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as eLife papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation. Summary: All three reviewers agreed that this work is very solid and interesting, giving important novel insights into immune evasion strategies by Human Cytomegalovirus with a focus on evasion from antibody mediated immune control. The authors show that HCMV counteracts Fc-gamma receptor (FcR) mediated immune control Fc-gamma binding glycoproteins (vFcRs) gp34 and gp68. Those viral proteins bind IgG simultaneously at topologically different Fc sites, and thereby efficiently antagonize FcR activation of the host. During our internal discussion, all three reviewers also agreed that the manuscript text shows some clear limitations. The text either needs to be adjusted or, if the authors insist on the cooperativity between gp34 and gp68, additional experiments need to be performed as outlined by reviewers 1 and 2. We all agreed to leave this decision to the authors. Essential Revisions: 1) The data presented in gp34 and gp68 transfected cells demonstrate some cooperativity with FcR reactivation. However, the addition of a high concentration of pooled anti-CMV IgGs to virus infected cells using virus variants lacking gp34, gp68, or both gp34/gp68 did not show cooperativity. This point is very important for the manuscript, as it is currently written, and therefore requires modification of the text, adjustment of the conclusions, or additional experiments. 2) Many figures only show, at best, a 2 fold change and it should be discussed that limiting ADCC by these viral genes is not a major immune evasion strategy. 3) The nature of the viruses needs to be described in more detail/more clearly. The text, in its current form, overlooks the absence of all other viral FcRs as they are assessing the cooperativity of gp34/gp68. Reviewer #1: Kolb et al., address a long-standing question regarding the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and UL119-118-encoded gp68 were previously shown by this group to prevent activation of cellular receptors for IgG. This manuscript now shows that these two synergize in antagonizing host FcgR activation such that \"gp34 enhances immune complex internalization and gp68 acts as inhibitor of host FcR binding to immune complexes\", revealing that these viral mimic block conformational changes within IgG that are crucial for Fc-mediated effector function. The major limitation of the work is the use of a parental virus that lacks other vFcgRs, which likely provides unencumbered phenotypes for gp34 and gp68 but is not the case with wild strains of HCMV. The limitations of the assay viruses must be fully disclosed and addressed in the manuscript. Figure 1 clearly shows that the two viral proteins bind independently to IgG, with gp34 associating with the upper hinge region and gp68 associating with the immunoglobulin domain CH2-CH3 interface. The data are consistent with previous literature and are themselves clear and convincing. Figure 2 seeks to demonstrate that antagonism by vFcgRs is cooperative using HCMV mutant viruses that are deficient in one or both, experiments performed a background of RL12 (gp95-deficiency). AD169 lacks many genes that are naturally found in wild strains of HCMV and that might influence the results observed here, including RL13 (gpRL13) which is lost in every viral strain upon propagation in cultured cells. Thus, panel A labeling requires much more text support owing to the use of not just RL12 but RL12/RL13 (and whatever other genes are absent in AD169 background). For clarity, RL11 (gp34-deficient), UL119-118 (gp68-deficient) and RL11/RL119-118 (double-deficient) terminology might be adopted for clarity. (NOTE: It would be important here to mention any specific role of UL12 (gp95) because mutant viruses appear to be RL11/RL12 double mutants. The same goes for the fact that RL13 is absent in this virus strain, although that might be an intractable issue.) Ambiguities would be resolved with experiments in a more fully competent strain of HCMV (such as in the conditional Merlin strain that retains RL13 as well as other genes that have gone missing in AD169). Further, statistical evaluations are necessary here to be sure that the appearance of a reduction in IL-2 production occurs only with the double mutant, and the y-axis should be labeled with the biologic protein being measured by ELISA as a surrogate for FcgRIII activation. Finally, the text should explain to the reader why antagonism by parental and either \"single mutant\" is associated with higher levels of IL-2 and lower NK cell CD107a positivity (panel B), which seem counterintuitive to this reviewer. These data seem to compare relevant mutants but do not allow the conclusion that \"that gp34 and gp68 antagonize FcRs by cooperative modes of action\" without stating as well \"in the absence of other known vFcgRs encoded by RL12 and RL13. Finally, careful work with viral mutants in the absence of biophysical data makes any conclusion of \"cooperative modes of action\" premature. Figure 3 examines the dynamics of gp34 and gp68 internalization, after replacing the transmembrane and cytosolic domains with CD4 domains, where differences compatible with the interpretation, \"gp34 compared to gp68 is mediating the efficient internalization of IC\" might be expressed better as \"native gp34 appears to be more efficient at internalizing IC than native gp68\". Here, it is not clear why more work was not performed with a mix of native gp34 and CD4 modified gp68 as well as native gp68 and CD4 modified gp34 (with the mix of and CD4 modified gp68 and CD4 modified gp34 potentially useful as well). There may be cooperation here and the data presented only hint at the conclusion that the authors favor. Figure 4 makes further use of CD4 modified gp34 and gp68 to maintain cell surface expression, and the conclusion, \"gp68 but not gp34 to significantly reduce binding of FcRIIIA/B to cell surface immune complexes compared to CD99\" is warranted. Again, it seems combination of native proteins with CD4 modified proteins would add important information to the interpretations offered here. Figure 5 returns to virus-infected cells to evaluate \"a strong relative reduction in FcRIIIA/B binding to opsonized HCMV-infected cells in the presence of gp68, but not gp34\", which is substantiated by the data shown. Figure 6 addresses the issue of why authors \"did not observe efficient antagonization of FcR activation by gp34 or gp68 individually in the context of HCMV deletion mutant infection\". Using an assay set up in HeLa cells, \"gp68 or gp34 individually confirmed to antagonize FcRIII activation\", \"the more membrane resident gp68-CD4 showed a markedly stronger antagonistic effect compared to gp68wt\", and \"internalization to be a major condition of gp34 driven antagonization of FcR activation\", which are substantiated. The authors then observe that \"the presence of an excess of non-immune IgG interferes with both gp68 and gp34 antagonization\" that is \"attributed to displacement of immune IgG from the vFcRs resulting in restoration of FcRIII activation\". All of this data appears useful and appropriate. Figure 7 goes on to show that the \"ectodomain of gp68 is sufficient to enhance the antagonistic effect of gp34\", which gets at some of the concerns raised with earlier data where combinations would have probably brought this to light. The overall conclusions are warranted, so long as it is clear to the reader that the virus being used lacks all other potentially relevant vFCgRs (when the double mutant is introduced, it would be appropriate to state that it lacks all known vFcgRs). In addition, it would be appropriate to divulge whether elimination of UL12 is necessary for these observations even if studies with conditional RL13 expression are not readily approachable and remains a mystery for future consideration. Limitations of the parental virus backbone should be an important topic for the Discussion. It is unlikely in this reviewer's eye that a set of mutants in fully WT (conditional) virus would behave the same as these particular set are shown to behave, thus discussion relating to clinical issues should be toned down. Reviewer #2: The manuscript investigates the mechanism cytomegalovirus proteins gp68 and gp34 as an immune evasion strategy to limit Fc receptor-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The study is based findings characterizing gp34 and gp68 as viral evasins during a virus infection. The manuscript describes that gp34 and gp68 function in a synergistic manner by enhances immune complex internalization and as an inhibitor of FcR binding to immune complexes, respectively. The manuscript systematically examines the function of gP34 and gp68 through virus infection and protein expression in transfected cells. Yet, the manuscript conclusion is based on only two-fold differences with the key conditions and virus studies do not demonstrate synergistic findings (Figure 2). 1) Figure 2 is a key experiment that demonstrates that the lack of gp34 and gp68 have an impact on FcyR activation. The data does not show cooperativity to down limit FcyR activation. The study should expand the kinetics of study and different concentrations of Cytotect as well as specific anti-CMV antibodies. 2) The study is based on previous publications and further define the mechanism of actions. However, the findings typically only demonstrate at most a 2-fold difference upon the expression of gp34 and gp68. This is mostly due to the analysis of using flow cytometry. The authors should include a more sensitive assay to define the function of gp34 and gp68 on FcyR activation. Reviewer #3: The manuscript by Kolb et al. builds on this laboratories 2014 publication showing that HCMV gp34 and gp68 are able to bind Fcg and in doing so, interrupt FcgR mediated activation signals including ADCC by NK cells. The paper demonstrates that gp34 and gp68 bind IgG at the same time and in doing so act in concert to mediate efficient prevention of FcgR activation by preventing cellular FcgR from binding the immune IgG and the removal of immune IgG/HCMV protein immune complexes from the cell surface, mediated by gp34. The apparent redundancy seen with HCMV immune evasion mechanisms is interesting and the clear indication from this work is that what might appear redundancy is actually not and more to do with efficient biological function with 2 viral proteins working in conjunction. The manuscript is on the whole well written and the experiments set out in a logical fashion. The inclusion of cartoons to assist the reader in understanding the experimental set up is welcome. The results demonstrate simultaneous binding that the dual action of gp34/68 is required for efficient inhibition of FcgR activation the role of gp34 in internalization and then the role gp68 in FcgR blocking. While various antigen v FcgR models are used for these experiments HCMV infected cells have also been used. The effect of excess non HCMV immune IgG as would be seen in sera/ in vivo has also been considered. The experiments have been carefully thought through and are well controlled appropriate statistical analysis has been performed and the data presented support the authors conclusions. I do not have any major concerns over this work. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63877.sa1](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63877.sa1) Author response Essential Revisions: 1) The data presented in gp34 and gp68 transfected cells demonstrate some cooperativity with FcR reactivation. However, the addition of a high concentration of pooled anti-CMV IgGs to virus infected cells using virus variants lacking gp34, gp68, or both gp34/gp68 did not show cooperativity. This point is very important for the manuscript, as it is currently written, and therefore requires modification of the text, adjustment of the conclusions, or additional experiments. We thank the reviewers for addressing this important point regarding our experiments in the context of viral infection when using HCMV hyperimmunoglobulin which contains excess of non-immune IgG (see Figure 2). As we here observed a strong antagonization when both molecules are expressed, but not when either gp34 or gp68 are expressed alone, we hypothesized that there must be cooperative mode of action. We agree with reviewer that the observed synergism does not allow the conclusion that there is a mechanistic cooperation from different effects. To address the concerns of the reviewers, we changed the text and figure legend to not overstate the data and describe the effects seen in Figure 2 as \"synergizing\". This adjustment expresses that we do not explicitly show cooperation in the sense of a molecular mechanism, but that a more than additive effect is observed. As the data strongly suggests cooperation, we then address this in the following experiments. In settings of reduced complexity, we finally confirmed cooperation and identified the opposing role of non-immune IgG as outlined in Figure 6. We added a new experiment in Figure 6C, showing synergy also in absence of non-immune IgG using a the mAb Herceptin in the context of HCMV infection by infecting newly generated Her2-expressing fibroblasts (see Results). This experiment also further supports the conclusions made in Figure 6B, that gp34 and gp68 individually show antagonization. Due to this experiment, Anne Halenius was added as a contributing author. 2) Many figures only show, at best, a 2 fold change and it should be discussed that limiting ADCC by these viral genes is not a major immune evasion strategy. We agree that some experiments show weak effects when looking at single values along a titration curve. We now express the overall antagonistic effects measured by our FcR-reporter assay as \"area under curve\" values with added statistics (see Figure 2). This expresses the antagonistic effect of vFcRs over the whole titration curve compared to single IVIg dilutions. This type of evaluation considers differences in the presence of excess non-immune IgG and better illustrates the strength of the antagonistic effects mediated by gp34 and gp68. 3) The nature of the viruses needs to be described in more detail/more clearly. The text, in its current form, overlooks the absence of all other viral FcRs as they are assessing the cooperativity of gp34/gp68. We agree that the decision to exclude other vFcRs has to be explained in more detail. In addition, we now clearly state the nature of the viral deletion mutants used in Figure 2 and the referring text and justify our decision. In brief, as we were specifically interested in the mechanisms behind the FcR-antagonists gp34 and gp68, we chose to exclude gp95 and gpRL13. Major arguments behind this decision were i) that gpRL13 is notoriously mutated in the HCMV genome upon cell culture passages and has not yet been described to antagonize FcR activation and ii) that gp95 is the most polymorphic gene of HCMV with only minor surface expression in the context of AD169 infection (Corrales-Aguilar et al., 2014). Due to remarkably little conservation of gp95 allelic forms across the strains of HCMV and its variable efficacy to inhibit host FcRs, we did not consider this molecule when describing the mechanisms of the much more conserved and well-described vFcRs gp34 and gp68. A manuscript alleles is currently in preparation. Reviewer #1: Kolb et al., address a long-standing question regarding the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and UL119-118-encoded gp68 were previously shown by this group to prevent activation of cellular receptors for IgG. This manuscript now shows that these two synergize in antagonizing host FcgR activation such that \"gp34 enhances immune complex internalization and gp68 acts as inhibitor of host FcR binding to immune complexes\", revealing that these viral mimic block conformational changes within IgG that are crucial for Fc-mediated effector function. The major limitation of the work is the use of a parental virus that lacks other vFcgRs, which likely provides unencumbered phenotypes for gp34 and gp68 but is not the case with wild strains of HCMV. The limitations of the assay viruses must be fully disclosed and addressed in the manuscript. Figure 1 clearly shows that the two viral proteins bind independently to IgG, with gp34 associating with the upper hinge region and gp68 associating with the immunoglobulin domain CH2-CH3 interface. The data are consistent with previous literature and are themselves clear and convincing. Figure 2 seeks to demonstrate that antagonism by vFcgRs is cooperative using HCMV mutant viruses that are deficient in one or both, experiments performed a background of RL12 (gp95-deficiency). AD169 lacks many genes that are naturally found in wild strains of HCMV and that might influence the results observed here, including RL13 (gpRL13) which is lost in every viral strain upon propagation in cultured cells. Thus, panel A labeling requires much more text support owing to the use of not just RL12 but RL12/RL13 (and whatever other genes are absent in AD169 background). For clarity, RL11 (gp34-deficient), UL119-118 (gp68-deficient) and RL11/RL119-118 (double-deficient) terminology might be adopted for clarity. (NOTE: It would be important here to mention any specific role of UL12 (gp95) because mutant viruses appear to be RL11/RL12 double mutants. The same goes for the fact that RL13 is absent in this virus strain, although that might be an intractable issue.) Ambiguities would be resolved with experiments in a more fully competent strain of HCMV (such as in the conditional Merlin strain that retains RL13 as well as other genes that have gone missing in AD169). Further, statistical evaluations are necessary here to be sure that the appearance of a reduction in IL-2 production occurs only with the double mutant, and the y-axis should be labeled with the biologic protein being measured by ELISA as a surrogate for FcgRIII activation. Finally, the text should explain to the reader why antagonism by parental and either \"single mutant\" is associated with higher levels of IL-2 and lower NK cell CD107a positivity (panel B), which seem counterintuitive to this reviewer. These data seem to compare relevant mutants but do not allow the conclusion that \"that gp34 and gp68 antagonize FcRs by cooperative modes of action\" without stating as well \"in the absence of other known vFcgRs encoded by RL12 and RL13. Finally, careful work with viral mutants in the absence of biophysical data makes any conclusion of \"cooperative modes of action\" premature. We thank the reviewer for his/her thoughtful and very thorough evaluation of our data. - Figure 2A: labeling was made more clear and the genetic background of the virus mutants used was clarified in the text and the legend. The designation of the mutants was kept throughout all figures (Figure 5A and Figure 6C). - Figure 2A: y-Axis labeling \"IL-2 A450nm\". - Figure 2A: \"Area under curve\" evaluation was added and statistical analysis was performed. - The conclusions were changed to \"synergize\" instead of \"cooperate\" to not overstate the data at this point. We make this conclusion subject to the absence of gp95 (RL12) and gpRL13 (RL13) (see Results). Cooperation between gp34 and gp68 and the role of non-immune IgG is specifically addressed in Figure 6. Figure 3 examines the dynamics of gp34 and gp68 internalization, after replacing the transmembrane and cytosolic domains with CD4 domains, where differences compatible with the interpretation, \"gp34 compared to gp68 is mediating the efficient internalization of IC\" might be expressed better as \"native gp34 appears to be more efficient at internalizing IC than native gp68\". Here, it is not clear why more work was not performed with a mix of native gp34 and CD4 modified gp68 as well as native gp68 and CD4 modified gp34 (with the mix of and CD4 modified gp68 and CD4 modified gp34 potentially useful as well). There may be cooperation here and the data presented only hint at the conclusion that the authors favor. - Wording was optimized to distinguish the CD4-tailed variants from native protein. - We agree that co-expression experiments would be an obvious choice. We chose not to pursue this as we frequently find internalization experiments to lack consistency when performing co-transfection in the context of over-expression in 293-T-CD20 cells. Further, internalization experiments in the context of viral infection were performed, but suffered from low consistency as we are currently lacking mAbs against HCMV vFcRs, which would be a necessary tool for this approach. Further, as indicated by the new Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1, following a single target in internalization with a humanized mAb is limited by the low surface expression of gH in the context of infection. Overall, we find internalization experiments to be highly sensitive and only conclusive in a low-complexity setting with high antigen expression. Figure 4 makes further use of CD4 modified gp34 and gp68 to maintain cell surface expression, and the conclusion, \"gp68 but not gp34 to significantly reduce binding of FcRIIIA/B to cell surface immune complexes compared to CD99\" is warranted. Again, it seems combination of native proteins with CD4 modified proteins would add important information to the interpretations offered here. We agree that co-expression would also mimic a more native combination of vFcR expression. Therefore, we chose to address this directly in the context of viral infection (Figure 5). Figure 5 returns to virus-infected cells to evaluate \"a strong relative reduction in FcRIIIA/B binding to opsonized HCMV-infected cells in the presence of gp68, but not gp34\", which is substantiated by the data shown. Figure 6 addresses the issue of why authors \"did not observe efficient antagonization of FcR activation by gp34 or gp68 individually in the context of HCMV deletion mutant infection\". Using an assay set up in HeLa cells, \"gp68 or gp34 individually confirmed to antagonize FcRIII activation\", \"the more membrane resident gp68-CD4 showed a markedly stronger antagonistic effect compared to gp68wt\", and \"internalization to be a major condition of gp34 driven antagonization of FcR activation\", which are substantiated. The authors then observe that \"the presence of an excess of non-immune IgG interferes with both gp68 and gp34 antagonization\" that is \"attributed to displacement of immune IgG from the vFcRs resulting in restoration of FcRIII activation\". All of this data appears useful and appropriate. Figure 7 goes on to show that the \"ectodomain of gp68 is sufficient to enhance the antagonistic effect of gp34\", which gets at some of the concerns raised with earlier data where combinations would have probably brought this to light.

In addition, it would be appropriate to divulge whether elimination of UL12 is necessary for these observations even if studies with conditional RL13 expression are not readily approachable and remains a mystery for future consideration. Limitations of the parental virus backbone should be an important topic for the Discussion. It is unlikely in this reviewer's eye that a set of mutants in fully WT (conditional) virus would behave the same as these particular set are shown to behave, thus discussion relating to clinical issues should be toned down. We have mentioned this important limitation of our study in the Discussion. Reviewer #2:The manuscript investigates the mechanism cytomegalovirus proteins gp68 and gp34 as an immune evasion strategy to limit Fc receptor-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The study is based findings characterizing gp34 and gp68 as viral evasins during a virus infection.

The data does not show cooperativity to down limit FcyR activation. The study should expand the kinetics of study and different concentrations of Cytotect as well as specific anti-CMV antibodies. - We thank the reviewer for pointing out a lack of clarity in the presentation of our data. However, we gently disagree regarding the content. Figure 2A and B show a clear over-additive inhibition when gp34 and gp68 are expressed together (blue curve) compared to the isolated expression (red and orange, respectively). The latter curves are close to the level of the control. We now included a statistical evaluation of the data comparing \"area under curve\" in addition to the depicting titration curve. - We have analysed 3 log10 steps of Cytotect and tested 72 hrs p.i. when gp34 and gp68 are expressed under steady state level conditions (Atalay et al., 2002). - We performed all experiments with titrated amounts of IVIg and now provide compiled data as \"area under curve\" graphs for panel A. Titration of IVIg regarding panel B was performed (1 \u00b5g and 0.1\u00b5g IVIg). We chose to omit this data from the graphs as there was no additional information and NK cell activation remained close to background level. - The reviewer suggestion to use monoclonal antibodies is very appropriate and was considered by us in the past. Specifically, we performed experiments using MSL-109 as a gH specific humanized monoclonal antibody which is commercially available. Unfortunately, low levels of gH on the surface of HCMV infected cells lead to very low reporter responses despite the high sensitivity of our reporter cell system (see new Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1). Therefore, we chose to use IVIg in the first place. Fortunately, using IVIg revealed to us the role of non-immune IgG in this setting, which was addressed in Figure 6 in a setting of reduced complexity. - We conducted a new experiment using a mAb against Her2 (Herceptin) instead of MSL109 in the context of permissive HCMV infection. This was made possible by using BJ foreskin fibroblasts stably expressing Her2. Commercially available humanized anti-HCMV gH (MSL-109) could not be used as we find marginal amounts of gH expressed on the surface of an infected cell. 2) The study is based on previous publications and further define the mechanism of actions. However, the findings typically only demonstrate at most a 2-fold difference upon the expression of gp34 and gp68. This is mostly due to the analysis of using flow cytometry. The authors should include a more sensitive assay to define the function of gp34 and gp68 on FcyR activation. - We agree that some experiments delineating molecular mechanisms using flow cytometry show weaker effects or when looking at single values along a titration curve. However, the functional read-out systems (e.g. the reporter cell assay as well as primary NK cell degranulation assay) demonstrates robust and significant differences (see Figure 2A and B).

Assessment of inflammatory and metabolic characteristics of a urbanizing African population and the comparison with populations outside Africa could provide insight in the pathophysiology of the rapidly increasing epidemic of NCDs, including the role of environmental and dietary changes. Using a proteomic plasma profiling approach comprising 92 inflammation-related molecules, we examined differences in the inflammatory proteome in healthy Tanzanian and healthy Dutch adults. We show that healthy Tanzanians display a pro-inflammatory phenotype compared to Dutch subjects, with enhanced activity of the Wnt/-catenin signalling pathway and higher concentrations of different metabolic regulators such as 4E-BP1 and fibroblast growth factor 21. Among the Tanzanian volunteers, food-derived metabolites were identified as an important driver of variation in inflammation-related molecules, emphasizing the potential importance of lifestyle changes. These findings endorse the importance of the current dietary transition and the inclusion of underrepresented populations in systems immunology studies. - - Genetics and Genomics - Immunology and Inflammation CD8+ tissue-resident memory T (CD8+ Trm) cells play key roles in many immune-inflammation-related diseases. However, their characteristics in the pathological process of oral lichen planus (OLP) remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the function of CD8+ Trm cells in the process of OLP. By using single-cell RNA sequencing profiling and spatial transcriptomics, we revealed that CD8+ Trm cells were predominantly located in the lamina propria adjacent to the basement membrane and were significantly increased in patients with erosive oral lichen planus (EOLP) compared to those with non-erosive oral lichen planus (NEOLP). Furthermore, these cells displayed enhanced production, including IFN- (Interferon-gamma, a pro-inflammatory signaling molecule), TNF- Necrosis cytokine regulating inflammation), and IL-17 (Interleukin-17, a cytokine involved in immune response modulation), in patients with EOLP. And our clinical cohort of 1-year follow-up was also supported the above results in RNA level and protein level. In conclusion, our study provided a novel molecular mechanism for triggering OLP erosion by CD8+ Trm cells to secrete multiple cytokines, and new insight "}
