We care for children with all types of respiratory disease including severe asthma, breathing problems and disorders, chronic respiratory symptoms and recurrent chest infections. At West Middlesex our consultant-led respiratory clinic specialises in the diagnosis, management and follow-up of children and young people up to 16 years with viral induced wheeze, asthma, pneumonia and other respiratory conditions, and children with, or who have been in contact with, tuberculosis. We run one consultant-led respiratory Clinic once a week and one joint outreached clinic with a respiratory consultant from The Royal Brompton Hospital every three months to discuss complicated patients. We also have a nurse-led tuberculosis screening clinic and a consultant-led tuberculosis clinic once a week.
