They can be made from just about any substance known to man, including plants, minerals, animal products, and energy fields. More than 5,000 substances have been prepared and \"proven.\" Examples range from mercury to mistletoe to calcium carbonate to dolphin milk to light spectrum (a rainbow). Homeopathic research is conducted through the process of proving, which determines the curative properties of a substance by observing and cataloging its effects. The proving process involves giving substances to healthy individuals and observing and recording symptoms, unusual sensations, and alterations from normal health, including what makes each of these better or worse. Once a substance is proven, it is used to treat people who have the same symptoms as those produced by the substance in healthy individuals. Prescribed Forms of Homeopathic Medicines: 1. Liquid - Dilutions: The dilutions are one of the most common forms of medicine used in homeopathy. These are readily available online as well as on homeopathic pharmaceutical stores and homeopathic physicians. 2. Pills (Globules) soaked with liquid dilutions: This is probably the most common method of dispensing homeopathic medicines. Usually, plastic or glass vials are used. There are various sizes of pills (globules) such as 10, 20, 30, 40, etc. and the dosage and repetition are decided by the treating physician. Pills are easy to administer and can be easily given to every age group. 3. Biochemic tablets: Biochemic salts (also known as Schussler's salt are commonly prescribed as homeopathic or add-on to homeopathic prescriptions. Their dose depends upon the condition and chronicity of the disease. For almost all biochemical salts and bio-combinations, the dosage is mentioned on the leaflet provided with them. Commonly 4-8 tabs per dose are recommended by homeopathic physicians. 4. Powder form: The powder used in homeopathic prescription is made up of milk sugar and is completely safe, even for kids. The liquid medicine or a few medicated pills are added to the powder as a dose. 5. Mother tinctures: Mother tinctures are the crude/base potency of homeopathic medicines. These are diluted with water for usage. Usually, these are given in less to moderate doses (ranging from 1 - 30 drops per dose). 6. Triturated Tablets: Triturated tablets are a form of homeopathic medicines containing low potencies of medicines in a suitable base (e.g. lactose). These are consumed either by chewing or crushed and mixed with water. Homeopathic medicines must always be taken as per the advice of a registered homeopathic practitioner only. If you are going to take homeopathic treatment, then please see the points stated below as Do's and Don'ts guidelines to take homeopathic medicines:- 1. Do Not Touch Homeopathic Remedies Do not take pills onto your palm before taking them, as touching medicines reduces the potency of the medicines. It also spoils the medicines by exposing them to any potential unhygienic conditions. Always take the medicines by using the cap of the medicine bottle or using a clean plastic spoon or using a clean plain paper. If you are going to use a paper then see to it that it does not contain any print. As ink can also spoil the medicine. Additionally, medicines must be capped and tightened properly after each use. Liquid potencies must be diluted in water before consumption. Usually, 04 drops of liquid dilution are diluted with 2 - 4tsp water, and 20 drops of mother tinctures are diluted in one cup of water, but this dilution factor may vary from practitioner to practitioner. Again don't touch it with your hand, use a hygienically clean plastic spoon. 2. Do Not eat or drink immediately before and after the medicines Do not eat or drink anything 20 to 30 minutes before and after taking the medicines. There must be an ample time gap between meals/consuming homeopathic medicines. The basic logic is that the lesser the smell in the mouth more effective the medicine would be. The only exception to this rule is water. Drinking water is permissible after or before five minutes of taking the medicines. 3. Say no to your addictions Do not smoke, chew tobacco, take drugs, and drink alcohol while you are taking homeopathic medicines. All the addictions are to be strictly avoided while taking homeopathic treatment. as it may have nullifying effects on the medicines. 4. Drink Tea or Coffee in moderation You may take Tea, Coffee, etc. (in less to moderate quantity), if not specifically restricted by the treating physician. Please remember, for some homeopathic medicines coffee acts as an antidote; as there are medicines prepared by using coffee in the crude as well as in the roasted form. That is why your homeopathic professional will be the right person to guide you whether coffee will do or not along with the homeopathic medicines you are taking. 5. Restrict your intake of onion, garlic, ginger, and other strong-smelling substances In general, there is no restriction to onion and garlic (as commonly asked by the patients), provided the patient maintains an ample gap between meals and medicines (before or after taking medicine). Strong smelling food items must be avoided immediately before or after taking homeopathic medicine. You may avoid strong smelling perfumes, medicated soaps, scented hair oils, etc., only if asked by the treating physician. 6. Other dietary restrictions It is not mandatory for homeopathic treatment to follow certain dietary restrictions exceptionally for homeopathic medicines. In some cases, there is a specific restriction of certain food/environmental items, which are told by the treating physician. For diseases like bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis, gout, or the disease which the intensity of which increases after taking certain food items you need to follow the dietary restrictions for some period till you start responding to the homeopathic line of treatment. Once you start responding to homeopathic medication, it is always good to reach out to your homeopathic professional to ask if you need to keep on the dietetic restrictions or you can ignore those. 7. Storage of homeopathic medicines Homeopathic drugs must be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight, heat, radiations such as microwave, TV, or strong odors such as camphor, solvents, paint, and chemicals, etc. Homeopathic medicines should not be refrigerated. 8. Other medications As per the latest research and experience, homeopathy can be taken as Add-on or complementary therapy along with other therapies or allopathic medicines. A half an hour gap is advisable between homeopathic and other medications. Remember, the route of action of homeopathy is different from the conventional medicines, hence it may be taken along with conventional medicines. Allopathic: if you are blood pressure, diabetes, epilepsy patient and if you are taking certain medicines for a longer period then it is not advisable to stop the medicines abruptly as you may encounter problems if you do that. Once you start responding positively to homeopathic treatment then your homeopath will advise to curtail down your medicines. Ayurvedic: Most of the Ayurvedic medicines and homeopathic medicines have the same source only the preparation differs. Because of that, it is better to confront your doctor about which Ayurvedic medicine (along with the contents of it) you are taking. If the medicines have adverse reactions to each other than your homeopath will advise you to stop the Ayurvedic medicines. Final Thought: Homeopathic medicines are completely safe but must be taken with consultation and supervision only. "}
