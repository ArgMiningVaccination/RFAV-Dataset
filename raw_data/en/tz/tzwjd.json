They just need to take you in the right direction.\" - Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Principia_(episode)) Doctor Jemma Anne Simmons, Ph.D is a genius biochemist and was one of the youngest and most prominent members of [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)'s research division. Along with [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), Simmons was recruited to [Coulson's Team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team) and worked with them on all of their missions. While on the team, Simmons became friends with [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward) and best friends with [Skye](/wiki/Skye). During the [HYDRA Uprising](/wiki/HYDRA_Uprising), Simmons was an active participant in hunting for [John Garrett](/wiki/John_Garrett) and the rest of the [Centipede Project](/wiki/Centipede_Project). She was shocked and saddened to learn that Ward had been a member of [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA). Despite the events surrounding the [Battle at Cybertek](/wiki/Battle_at_Cybertek) and Fitz's severe injury, Simmons stayed with the team to help rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D. as [Nick Fury](/wiki/Nick_Fury) requested. As Coulson began to rebuild S.H.I.E.L.D., she became aware that her presence was impeding Fitz's healing and took an undercover assignment to infiltrate HYDRA, but returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. when [Raina](/wiki/Raina) broke her cover. She aided the team in their search for the [Kree City](/wiki/Kree_City) and in other operations. When the [Playground](/wiki/Playground) was [attacked](/wiki/Attack_on_the_Playground) by another S.H.I.E.L.D. faction led by [Robert Gonzales](/wiki/Robert_Gonzales), she remained loyal to Coulson. After the [War Against the Inhumans](/wiki/War_Against_the_Inhumans), Simmons found herself teleported to [Maveth](/wiki/Maveth) after being swallowed by the [Monolith](/wiki/Monolith). In the six months she spent there, Simmons met and fell in love with [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels), until she was brought back to [Earth](/wiki/Earth) by Fitz and S.H.I.E.L.D.. Simmons then dedicated her time to attempt to reopen the portal, determined to bring back Daniels, only to hear from Fitz that he was killed by [Hive](/wiki/Hive) who managed to return to Earth. Fitz and Simmons tried to find a cure to Hive's power of controlling Inhumans' minds before S.H.I.E.L.D. eventually managed to kill Hive. [Jeffrey Mace](/wiki/Jeffrey_Mace) was appointed S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new Director after the signing of the [Sokovia Accords](/wiki/Sokovia_Accords). Although she did not trust him, he appointed Simmons as his advisor in science and technology, which led to her becoming one of the superiors in the organization. Simmons investigated the existing of another dimension and helped S.H.I.E.L.D. to defeat [Eli Morrow](/wiki/Eli_Morrow). With [Holden Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe)'s betrayal of S.H.I.E.L.D. and his kidnapping of most of her friends, Simmons and [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) entered the [Framework](/wiki/Framework) in order to rescue them. They succeeded and they all returned to the real world but had to face against the threat of the now living [Aida](/wiki/Aida). S.H.I.E.L.D. stopped the crazed Inhuman, but Simmons and others were sent to the year [2091](/wiki/2091) afterwards. The team found themselves in a bunker located in the ruins of Earth called the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse) and Simmons ended up becoming a servant of [Kasius](/wiki/Kasius). She was later freed by [Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) who managed to come from the past to save her and the two engaged. Eventually, she and the others managed to return to the present, where she and Fitz would soon be married by Coulson. They worked to prevent the [Destruction of Earth](/wiki/Destruction_of_Earth), came into conflict with [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) led by [Hale](/wiki/Hale) and later with the [Confederacy](/wiki/Confederacy). They managed to kill [Glenn Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot), thus saving Earth; however, Fitz lost his life in the battle. Simmons followed [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s new Director, searching for the present-day Fitz frozen in space. The search lasted for a year to no prevail. However, Simmons forced the mission to continue which resulted in them being captured by the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) and be reunited with Fitz. The Chronicoms used them to help them achieve [time travel](/wiki/Time_Travel), but they were able to escape and were recruited by [Izel](/wiki/Izel), who helped them get back to Earth. However, they learnt that Izel was intending to unleash her forces upon Earth, and they were rescued by S.H.I.E.L.D.. They continued to fight against Izel, as well as engage in an uneasy alliance with [Sarge](/wiki/Sarge), who looked exactly like Coulson. While S.H.I.E.L.D stopped Izel and Sarge, Simmons and Fitz were ambushed by the [Chronicom Hunters](/wiki/Chronicom_Hunters), and were saved by [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch). The three escaped and for years they were working on a way to a achieve time travel. During this time Simmons gave birth to her and Fitz's daughter, [Alya](/wiki/Alya_Fitz). When they succeeded, as well as creating the advanced LMD [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) to help them fight the Hunters, Simmons returned to [2019](/wiki/2019) and with the team jumped to the year [1931](/wiki/1930s/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms#1931). In order to keep Fitz's location a secret from the Chronicoms, Simmons had been implanted with a [biological device](/wiki/D.I.A.N.A.) which suppressed her memory. Together with the team, she jumped through diferrent points in alterative past to stop the Chronicoms to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. and establish thier new home planet on Earth. Due to the changed timeline, Simmons was kidnapped by [Nathaniel Malick](/wiki/Nathaniel_Malick/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms), who tried to extract Fitz's location from her mind, but for vain. However, the experience, in addition to a chemical injected to her by the Chronicoms leader [Sibyl](/wiki/Sibyl), caused Simmons to lose her memory. When she was reunited with her team, she was able to build a device which brought Fitz back. He helped her gain her memory back and they managed to returned to their original timeline. They defeated the Chronicoms and Simmons and Fitz reunited with their daughter. Following thier victory, Simmons and Fitz retired from S.H.I.E.L.D. to raise Alya together in peace. Biography[ ] Early Life[ ] Childhood[ ] - \"I had [scoliosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scoliosis)as a kid. There's small surgery to correct it. I was flat on my back for weeks. So to help combat the boredom, every night, my father would wheel my bed out, talk about the stars.\" - Jemma Simmons to [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels) [[src]](/wiki/4,722_Hours) Jemma Simmons was born on Friday, [September 11, 1987](/wiki/1980s#1987) in [Ashburton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashburton,_Devon), [Devon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon), [England](/wiki/England). When Simmons was was born, she came out upside-down with her umbilical cord wrapped around her head. [[6]](#cite_note-AoS122-6) During her youth, Simmons was bed-ridden by [scoliosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scoliosis); her father, to relieve her boredom, would place her bed outdoors so they could stargaze together. [[7]](#cite_note-AoS305-7) From an early age, Simmons developed a passion for science and had her bedroom filled with a lot of items related to [Biochemistry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biochemistry). She desired to be a biologist due to her fascination with life and living organisms, including [Cuttlefish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlefish). Simmons would sometimes find herself kept up at night, overwhelmed with troubles. So, her father told her to put all her troubles in her music box and that they would stay in there. [[8]](#cite_note-AoS606-8) On a family vacation to [Perthshire](/wiki/Perthshire), they drove by a house that Simmons loved. She imagined that she would live their with her future husband. [[9]](#cite_note-AoS307-9) S.H.I.E.L.D.[ ] S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy[ ] Simmons started attending the [S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Science and Technology](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D._Academy_of_Science_and_Technology), where she met [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz). The two were the youngest ever enrolled. [[8]](#cite_note-AoS606-8) Among their instructors were [Vaughn](/wiki/Vaughn) [[10]](#cite_note-AoS102-10) and [Franklin Hall](/wiki/Franklin_Hall), who taught chemical kinetics during their second year. [[11]](#cite_note-AoS103-11) Working with Leo Fitz[ ] Simmons was originally rivals with [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), due to both being the smartest in their classes. They would constantly compete with each other, never speaking to each other until they were paired together in chem lab, where they realized that together they were twice as smart. [[12]](#cite_note-AoS112DS-12) One night, the two planned to meet together in Fitz's room, but on her way there, she got caught up in a conversation with Professor [Anne Weaver](/wiki/Anne_Weaver), which caused her to be twenty-four minutes late. When she arrived, Fitz addressed her lateness, which he feared was because she had blown him off. The two then awkwardly talked about each other's rooms until Simmons brought up the reason Fitz called her to his room, which was to help out with a problem he had. But due to him trying to play cool, he told her that he really didn't need her help but thought it would be good to bounce ideas off her, which she interpreted as him seeing her as \"thick wall\". Fitz then tried to correct what he meant by saying she was good at clarifying good ideas and mapping out consequential results. That night, Simmons would put Fitz in the friend zone. [[8]](#cite_note-AoS606-8) Simmons would have a relationship with [Milton](/wiki/Milton) during this time, to the dismay of Fitz, [[13]](#cite_note-AoS319-13) but he would be her only boyfriend, as Simmons didn't find anyone interesting, except Fitz. Despite this, Simmons still had a few sexual encounters with others, including a one-night stand with [Tad](/wiki/Tad_(S.H.I.E.L.D.)), who she found boring, and never called back. [[12]](#cite_note-AoS112DS-12) Simmons and Fitz graduated from the [S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D._Academy) three years early [[14]](#cite_note-AoS109-14) in [2004](/wiki/2000s#2004). [[15]](#cite_note-AoS203-15) Simmons was top of her class, earning two PhDs. [[16]](#cite_note-AoS205-16) Joining S.H.I.E.L.D.[ ] - \"Why did you join [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)in the first place?\" \"I was a 17-year-old girl with two PhDs and a million questions. S.H.I.E.L.D. had the resources to help me answer them.\" - [Sunil Bakshi](/wiki/Sunil_Bakshi)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Making_Friends_and_Influencing_People) A 17-year-old biochemistry genius with two PhDs, Simmons, wanting to get answers to millions of questions that she had, joined [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) as an agent. [[15]](#cite_note-AoS203-15) Wanting to see more than the inside of a lab, and against the advice of Professor [Vaughn](/wiki/Vaughn), Simmons convinced [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) to seek out a field assignment, claiming it would be the perfect opportunity to see the world. [[10]](#cite_note-AoS102-10) Meeting Phil Coulson[ ] - \"The powers at be have also recommended you for [my team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team).\" \"The... field team?\" \"This is an honor. Thank you for this opportunity.\" \"Yeah, we would love the chance to discuss it and think about it more.\" - [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson), [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Inescapable) Simmons were called in to meet with [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson), for which they were both very nervous for, Fitz thinking they were getting transferred. As they walked up to the room, they talked amongst themselves about Coulson and the stories that they heard about him, making them more nervous, despite Simmons trying to stay calm about it. They then introduced themselves to Coulson, who was under the impression that \"FitzSimmons\" was one person. Coulson then went through the history, being the youngest to graduate, and an unauthorized [biofuel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biofuel) experiment they conducted, which resulted in an explosion. However, not only did their experiment: a new way to power a [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) with an algae biofuel hydrogen cell, inspire the superiors to use their design, but to also nominate them for a new [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) [operative group](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team). Simmons was excited by the idea, but Fitz was initially against going, being afraid to go into the field, but Simmons was able to convince him. Stationed on the [Bus](/wiki/Bus), the pair have designed specialized equipment and compounds on the fly in various emergency situations. [[8]](#cite_note-AoS606-8) [Coulson's Team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team)[ ] Field Work[ ] - \"So, are you excited to be coming on our journey into mystery?\" \"It's like Christmas.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward) [[src]](/wiki/Pilot) Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) were the first to arrive on the [Bus](/wiki/Bus), unloading all their equipment and bickering between each other until they were interrupted by [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward), the next person on their team to arrive. Simmons then obtained a DNA sample from Ward and greeted the agent, excited for their \"journey into mystery\". [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) then arrived and the team would soon begin to take off, commencing their soon to be multiple missions together. [[1]](#cite_note-AoS101-1) [Chase of Michael Peterson](/wiki/Chase_of_Michael_Peterson)[ ] - \"Sir, [he](/wiki/List_of_Minor_Characters#Pilot)didn't explode because he was angry. The two are connected. Well, it's kind of a chemical surge, but calming [him](/wiki/Michael_Peterson)down will buy him a minute at most. He will detonate within the next few hours.\" - Jemma Simmons to [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) [[src]](/wiki/Pilot) Their first foray into the field involved the case of [Michael Peterson](/wiki/Michael_Peterson), a man in danger of exploding due to his use of the volatile [Centipede Serum](/wiki/Centipede_Serum). [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) and Simmons investigated the [Centipede Device](/wiki/Centipede_Device) and found that it was a combination of all known causes of superpowers including [Chitauri](/wiki/Chitauri) technology, [gamma radiation](/wiki/Gamma_Radiation), the [Super Soldier Serum](/wiki/Super_Soldier_Serum), and [Extremis](/wiki/Extremis). Meanwhile, they reproduced footage from the crime scene using the flash memory of a video camera and the audio recorded by [Skye](/wiki/Skye) who had bugged the lab. When Skye was kidnapped by Peterson, the team tracked them down to [Union Station](/wiki/Union_Station), trying to find a way to stop him without killing him. Simmons and Fitz eventually found a way to tranquilize Peterson without killing him and were able to give [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward) the [Night-Night Gun](/wiki/Night-Night_Gun) before Peterson would cause an explosion from the Extremis. Simmons checked on Peterson and confirmed him to still be alive. [[1]](#cite_note-AoS101-1) Finding an 0-8-4[ ] The [team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team) then became aware of an [0-8-4](/wiki/0-8-4_(Code)) in [Peru](/wiki/Peru). As Simmons, [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), and [Skye](/wiki/Skye) were inspecting the [0-8-4](/wiki/Peruvian_0-8-4), they soon came under attack, causing them to have to escape with the Peruvian rebels only to face an armed takeover of the [Bus](/wiki/Bus). Being captured and tied up by the rebels, the team worked together to take back the Bus by activating the 0-8-4, causing it to blow a hole in the side of the Bus. The team was successful in retaking the Bus and securing the old [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) weapon. They then decided that the 0-8-4 should be taken to the [Slingshot](/wiki/Slingshot) to be destroyed. When they arrived, they watched as the rocket took off. [[10]](#cite_note-AoS102-10) Gravitonium[ ] - \"Well, [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium)distorts gravity fields within itself, an undulating, amorphous shape.\" \"Which causes these, um, wiggly bits here. But when an electric current is applied, the gravitonium solidifies. And those gravity fields erupt, randomly changing the rules of gravity around it.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)to [Skye](/wiki/Skye) received a message that a [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) lorry transporting cargo had been attacked by a mysterious and invisible enemy. The team investigated and Simmons discovered that a rare element called [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium) was the cause of the attack. The team then learned that it was in fact [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) and Simmons' former mentor, [Franklin Hall](/wiki/Franklin_Hall), who was the cargo and he had been kidnapped by billionaire [Ian Quinn](/wiki/Ian_Quinn). The team was sent into rescue Hall from Quinn's island home, with Simmons, [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) and Fitz observing [Skye](/wiki/Skye) as she infiltrated an event held by Quinn. They then discovered that Hall was behind him getting captured in order to destroy Quinn's compound. When [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) attempted to shut down the machine, he failed, so Simmons told him to then find a catalyst, forcing Coulson to kill him. [[11]](#cite_note-AoS103-11) Searching for Akela Amador[ ] - \"I may need your feedback during the operation. Which means I have to inject a local anesthetic into your eye rather than putting you under.\" \"Whatever's May](/wiki/Melinda_May), and [Skye](/wiki/Skye) investigated a robbery where a group of military officers, escorting some diamonds were taken down by one woman who did it with her eyes closed. They soon learned that the assailant was [Akela Amador](/wiki/Akela_Amador), Coulson's old protege. The [team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team) then went to search for Amador, Simmons, [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) and Skye being instructed to look for her electronically in the van. They then began to search for Amador, until they came across a broadcast with an unusual signal containing live surveillance looking at a van, which they then realized was their van. At that moment, they were hit by a truck, knocking them into a ditch. The team then regrouped in the Bus, where they were able to continue to see the surveillance, learning that Amador was being controlled. Simmons and Fitz were able to save Amador, performing surgery on her to remove the [Backscatter X-Ray Eye Implant](/wiki/Backscatter_X-Ray_Eye_Implant), despite it being a challenge for both of them. [[17]](#cite_note-AoS104-17) Scorch[ ] - \"Simmons thinks that considering [he](/wiki/Scorch)'s pyrokinetic...\" \"There's a good chance genetics could stabilise the [Extremis](/wiki/Extremis)elements the [Centipede Serum](/wiki/Centipede_Serum).\" Simmons team of [Chan Ho Yin](/wiki/Chan_Ho_Yin), a man with pyrokinetic abilities was kidnapped. The [team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team) then observed as [Skye](/wiki/Skye) tracked down a [Rising Tide](/wiki/Rising_Tide) [hacker](/wiki/Miles_Lydon) responsible for Chan's disappearance in [Austin](/wiki/Austin), [Texas](/wiki/Texas). The team then learned that Skye was in contact with the [hacker](/wiki/Miles_Lydon) and warned him about them. When they confronted Skye, Simmon and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) went through some of Lydon's files while discussing Skye lying to them. Back on the [Bus](/wiki/Bus), Simmons, and Fitz continued to look through Lydon's files until they found some evidence on him selling information, which Simmons went to inform Coulson about. They then learned that Chan was taken to a [Centipede research base](/wiki/Hong_Kong_Centipede_Base), which Simmons believed they were using him because his abilities would stabilize the [Extremis](/wiki/Extremis) element of the [Centipede Serum](/wiki/Centipede_Serum). The team attempted to rescue Chan, going by \"Scorch\" now, but were unable to, forcing them to cause him to overheat, killing him. [[18]](#cite_note-AoS105-18) Infected[ ] - \"Sir, I know the protocols in these circumstances... but, could you please tell my dad first? I just think my mum would take it better if it comes from him.\" \"We're not there yet. There's still time.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) [[src]](/wiki/FZZT) After helping [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) with his physical, Simmons joined [Skye](/wiki/Skye) and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), who informed her of [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward)'s dissatisfaction with the weight of the [Night-Night Gun](/wiki/Night-Night_Gun), causing Simmons to do an impression of Ward, just like what Fitz was doing before she arrived. While investigating a mysterious death in [Wrigley](/wiki/Wrigley), [Pennsylvania](/wiki/Pennsylvania), Simmons was unknowingly infected with a lethal alien [virus](/wiki/Chitauri_Virus) passed along from a [Chitauri Helmet](/wiki/Chitauri_Helmet). Simmons began an autopsy on the body to find out why it was floating, discovering a powerful electrical charge that had affected the brain. As Simmons inspected the second body, [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) showed her a Chitauri Helmet causing Simmons to realize that it was a source for a virus. Simmons was instructed in trying to find a cure, astonished by what she was discovering. However, Coulson came to realize that Simmons was infected, causing him to put her in quarantine. Simmons continued to try and find a cure, running out of time before she would succumb to the virus completely. With time running out, Simmons and Fitz, overwhelmed by emotions, began to argue with each other until they eventually thought of how to make the cure. Simmons and Fitz, who was now inside the quarantine, starting working on the cure only to end up another seemingly failed attempt. Simmons, believing she had no hope left, asked to be alone with Fitz only so she could knock him out and go to jump out go the Bus. Simmons then threw herself from the [Bus](/wiki/Bus), unaware that the cure did work. Fortunately, Ward caught her in mid-flight, gave her the cure and parachuted them both to safety. They were eventually retrieved, where Coulson spoke with them, informing Simmons not to do anything like that again. [[19]](#cite_note-AoS106-19) The Hub[ ] After rescuing [Shaw](/wiki/Shaw_(Agent)), a [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) agent whose cover had been blown, Simmons extracted a storage device from his nasal cavity, containing all of the intel that he had gathered. [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) then mentioned that they would be going to the [Hub](/wiki/Hub_(S.H.I.E.L.D._Facility)), Simmons became very excited, not being there for a long time. When they arrived, Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) explored the area, intrigued by the new equipment that would be present. As Fitz packed for his [mission](/wiki/Infiltration_into_the_Overkill_Facility), Simmons expressed her concerns as well as giving him his favourite sandwich, which she made herself. As they waited, Simmons and [Skye](/wiki/Skye) began to investigate the nature of Fitz and [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward)'s mission. However, Simmons was discovered by agent [Sitwell](/wiki/Jasper_Sitwell) and tried to lie her way past him. Acting irrationally, Simmons then used the [Night-Night Gun](/wiki/Night-Night_Gun) on him, knocking him out. She then dragged his body away and returned to Skye. She then joined [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May), Skye, and Coulson in extracting Fitz and Ward. [[4]](#cite_note-AoS107-4) Encounters with Asgard[ ] - \"Other worlds, with names like [Asgard](/wiki/Asgard), do exist. And [beings](/wiki/Asgardians)once revered as gods, like [Thor](/wiki/Thor), have returned, leaving us with more questions, and... an [enormous mess](/wiki/Battle_of_Greenwich)to clean up.\" - Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/The_Well) Later, Simmons accompanied the [team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team) with the cleanup of the aftermath of the [Battle of Greenwich](/wiki/Battle_of_Greenwich), ignoring calls from her parents wanting to check up on her. The team then found themselves in [Trillemarka National Park](/wiki/Trillemarka_National_Park), where a mysterious couple cut down a tree and attacked the park rangers. Simmons was required to climb up the tree to inspect it, despite her fears. She then found that there were traces of alien substances in the tree where it had been cut, learning that it was of [Asgardian](/wiki/Asgardians) creation. Simmons, [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) then went to visit [Elliot Randolph](/wiki/Elliot_Randolph), an expert on Norse Mythology, where he informed them that the item the couple had stolen was a piece of the [Berserker Staff](/wiki/Berserker_Staff). After the team failed to retrieve the next piece of the staff, Simmons checked on [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward), who became unconscious during the mission from touching the staff. When they went to retrieve the third piece, they were ambushed by [Jakob Nystrom](/wiki/Jakob_Nystrom), who stabbed Randolph. Simmons and Coulson went to revive him, but despite not being aware of his anatomy, they were successful. The team were able to obtain the staff and Simmons finally answered her parents calls. [[20]](#cite_note-AoS108-20) Portal Discovery[ ] - \"Trying to create another portal, yes. This \" [ghost](/wiki/Tobias_Ford)\" is a man trapped between our universe and another. Perhaps that's how all ghosts are.\" - Jemma Simmons to [Leo and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) visited [StatiCorp](/wiki/StatiCorp) after its particle accelerator exploded and scanned the area, discussing the possibility of telekinesis and there time at the academy, realizing that they never got to pull any pranks on any freshmen. Simmons then decided to pull a prank on [Skye](/wiki/Skye), as she never went to the academy. When Simmons and Fitz were analyzing [Hannah Hutchins](/wiki/Hannah_Hutchins), they noticed no irregularities in her brain waves. When Skye asks about the origin of \"The Cavalry\", Simmons took that as the opportunity to prank Skye, telling her an incredibly bizarre story. Simmons then discovered that the StatiCorp explosion actually ripped a portal between worlds and the \" [demon](/wiki/Demons)\" that the team were investigating was [Tobias Ford](/wiki/Tobias_Ford). As Simmons made this discovery, Ford emerged behind her and attempted to attack her, disappearing shortly after. Ford then attacked the [Bus](/wiki/Bus) and managed to ground it. They learned that Ford was trapped between worlds as a ghostly figure and was attacking anyone who got near the woman he loved, Hutchins. Ford was ultimately stopped by [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May), who managed to talk him down. [[14]](#cite_note-AoS109-14) The Clairvoyant[ ] Recruiting Mike Peterson[ ] When the [team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team) continued to track the group who created the [Centipede Serum](/wiki/Centipede_Serum), [Centipede Project](/wiki/Centipede_Project) and locate [Edison Po](/wiki/Edison_Po), they were teamed up with [Mike Peterson](/wiki/Mike_Peterson), who was now working with [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.). Simmons then did some tests on Peterson, where she learnt that the [Night-Night Gun](/wiki/Night-Night_Gun) that she and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) designed was what stabilized him. Later, the team learnt that Centipede Project had kidnapped [Ace Peterson](/wiki/Ace_Peterson) and would trade for his father. The team decided to agree with the deal, using Simmons' [Tracking Scent](/wiki/Tracking_Scent) to locate Peterson when he is taken. However, it turned out that it was [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) that they wanted, taking him instead. [[21]](#cite_note-AoS110-21) Finding Phil Coulson[ ] The team then began the search for Coulson, leading them to taking [T. Vanchat](/wiki/T._Vanchat), hoping he would be able to tell them the whereabouts of Coulson. As they continued to search for him, the team found themselves frustrated with [Victoria Hand](/wiki/Victoria_Hand)'s priorities not being of rescuing Coulson, and having too many agents onboard making no progress, as well as removing [Skye](/wiki/Skye) from the mission. Simmons and Fitz gave Skye a satellite phone in case of an emergency as well as informing her of how much time she had to try and locate Coulson on her own. Simmons and Fitz worked on the [Night-Night Bracelet](/wiki/Night-Night_Bracelet), designed to be able to neutralize people with the [Centipede Serum](/wiki/Centipede_Serum). Simmons then received a call from Skye via the phone she gave her, informing them of the location of Coulson. When they arrived, [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward) went to deal with one of the soldiers, while the rest went to find Coulson. The team were able to rescue Coulson and bring him back to the [Bus](/wiki/Bus). [[22]](#cite_note-AoS111-22) Ian Quinn's Activities[ ] - \"No. That's an order.\" \"That's not a good enough reason! I have a duty to you, sir, as my commanding officer, but I also have a duty as a [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)scientist to pursue [this](/wiki/GH.325), to save lives!\" - [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Yes_Men) Due to an attack at the [S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D._Academy), Simmons and Fitz were asked to come in and help on the investigation as a [device](/wiki/Atmospheric_Moisture_Freezing_Device) they created was used for the attack. They were greeted by [Anne Weaver](/wiki/Anne_Weaver) and asked to give the students a speech about their own experiences working for [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.). During the speech, one student named [Donnie Gill](/wiki/Donnie_Gill) was frozen in ice and nearly killed in a similar attack. Simmons and Fitz managed to save his life and continued their investigation. They later learned that it was in fact Gill and another student, [Seth Dormer](/wiki/Seth_Dormer), who had arranged the attacks on themselves to draw Fitz to the academy so he could inadvertently help them finish their design for a Freezing Device. The team managed to track down the pair, Dormer was killed by a lightning strike and Gill was arrested. [[23]](#cite_note-AoS112-23) Coulson, May, and Ward returned after a mission and gave Fitz-Simmons a [weapon](/wiki/Chitauri_Overkill_Weapon) and told them to study it. They found out that it was [Chitauri](/wiki/Chitauri) and related to [Ian Quinn](/wiki/Ian_Quinn). When [Skye](/wiki/Skye) hacked into the databases, she traced the origin to [France](/wiki/France). During the mission, Fitz was captured by the enemy, but he turned on his tracker. Simmons worriedly waited on the Bus as the rest of the team saved Fitz. The weapon was detonated as they left. Simmons hugged Fitz and made sure he was okay. [[24]](#cite_note-AoSTC-24) When trying to locate [Ian Quinn](/wiki/Ian_Quinn), the team were able to uncover a purchase he had made and that it would be transported on a train in [Italy](/wiki/Italy). Simmons and Coulson posed as father and daughter in order to distract the [carrier](/wiki/Carlo_Mancini) of the package to put tracking dust on him. When Coulson reminded Simmons of their target, Simmons informed him that she had prepared for everything, including an excessively detailed backstory for their characters, stating that she is not good at improvising. Simmons then began to cause a distraction, bumping into Mancini, placing the tracking dust on him. When there was an interference with the comms, Ward went to Simmons to inform her that they had been made, telling her to go to Fitz and Skye. When Simmons got to them, they were being attacked by a man who then pulled out a [Dendrotoxin Grenade](/wiki/Dendrotoxin_Grenade), causing Simmons to try and contain the blast with her body. She was affected by the blast, causing her to be in a state of unconsciousness. Simmons eventually woke up and was found by the team. They then followed a tracker that Fitz and Skye had set, leading them to Quinn's mansion, where they found Skye bleeding out. Simmons saw the [Hyperbaric Chamber](/wiki/Hyperbaric_Chamber) and told them to put her in there. Simmons was able to keep Skye alive, but would need to give her medical attention soon. [[25]](#cite_note-AoS113-25) The team brought Skye to the [S.H.I.E.L.D. Trauma Zentrum](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D._Trauma_Zentrum), where the doctors would try to save her. After a while, the team were informed that there was too much damage and that she would only be able to stay alive on life support. With no other options, Coulson decided to try and save Skye the same way he was revived. Simmons and Fitz were instructed in analyzing Coulson's death and recovery report, to understand the medical procedures that took place. They were boarded by [John Garrett](/wiki/John_Garrett) and [Antoine Triplett](/wiki/Antoine_Triplett) in order to take [Ian to the [Fridge](/wiki/Fridge). Simmons and Fitz came across [GH.325](/wiki/GH.325) and believed it to be what could save Skye from her fatal injuries. The two were able to locate the [Guest House](/wiki/Guest_House), where Garrett, Coulson, Ward, and Fitz went to find the GH.325. Simmons and Triplett monitored Skye and got to know each other. Fitz was able to bring one sample of the drug back and Simmons successful in reviving Skye. [[26]](#cite_note-AoS114-26) After Skye recovered, Simmons would still continue to keep her under watch, secretly extracting blood samples from her to find something definitive about the drug she was given under strict orders from Coulson. Simmons expressed her thoughts on not being able to upload any of it to S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ, believing the drug to be a breakthrough. The team then came into learning of a strange energy reading over [California](/wiki/California). Simmons pointed out the similarities to the ones [Erik Selvig](/wiki/Erik_Selvig) recorded in [New Mexico](/wiki/New_Mexico) and [London](/wiki/London). The energy readings turned out to by that of the arrival of [Lady Sif](/wiki/Sif), who was there to track down an escaped Asgardian, [Lorelei](/wiki/Lorelei). While the team tried to locate Lorelei, who had enthralled Ward, Simmons took the time to ask Coulson about sending samples of Skye's blood to HQ, which Coulson immediately rejected. When Lorelei hijacked the Bus and enthralled Fitz, he locked Simmons and Skye in the recovery room. When Coulson opened the room, they informed him that Sif had been sucked out of the Bus, not realizing that she was actually still hanging on. They then opened the hatch and they were able to defeat Lorelei. [[27]](#cite_note-AoS115-27) Simmons continued to work on uncovering exactly what the [drug](/wiki/GH.325) was in Skye's blood while the rest of the team made progress in their search for the Clairvoyant. When [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) discovered that she was working on the drug, she asked some questions about Coulson and Skye's behavior, to which Simmons had nothing to comment on. After [Deathlok](/wiki/Deathlok) critically injured [Felix Blake](/wiki/Felix_Blake), Simmons was transferred to the [Hub](/wiki/Hub_(S.H.I.E.L.D._Facility)) to be a consultant on Deathlok. She was enthusiastic because the Hub had better equipment than the Bus for analyzing Skye's and Coulson's blood to reproduce the drug. As she discussed this with Fitz, Triplett, who was order to be her escort, entered, causing Simmons to be happily surprised by this, due to her attraction to him. At the Hub, Simmons and Triplett watched the mission to track Deathlock, leading to them finding the [Clairvoyant](/wiki/Thomas_Nash), who Ward shot and killed. [[28]](#cite_note-AoS116-28) [HYDRA Uprising](/wiki/HYDRA_Uprising)[ ] Still at the [Hub](/wiki/Hub_(S.H.I.E.L.D._Facility)), Simmons utilized the better equipment to continue to try to uncover the drug. She was then interrupted by [Antoine Triplett](/wiki/Antoine_Triplett), who began to question her when she started to act secretive about what she was doing. Simmons then told Triplett about what she was doing, including wishing to contact [Anne Weaver](/wiki/Anne_Weaver) for assistance. Triplett then decided to help Simmons in her research, telling her if they get questioned, he'll do the talking due to her inability to convincingly lie. Simmons called Weaver for assistance, but she had her own problems: [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) was taking over the [S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D._Academy). Weaver warned Simmons that the war had begun. Simmons found herself locked in a room with Triplett, but he quelled her fears by giving her his pocket knife. When [Victoria Hand](/wiki/Victoria_Hand)'s agents found them, they passed her test of loyalty to [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.). When [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)'s loyalty was questioned, Simmons argued with Hand until she had his \"crimes\" listed. Ultimately, Simmons was reunited with the [team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team) as well as being impressed by Tripett's strength and loyalty. [[29]](#cite_note-AoS117-29) In the aftermath, Simmons, [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) and Triplett began to repair the [Bus](/wiki/Bus). When the team was forced to leave the [Hub](/wiki/Hub_(S.H.I.E.L.D._Facility)), Simmons vouched for Triplett's loyalty and place on the team, which Coulson agreed to, giving her the responsibility for him. In order to not get hunted, the team's digital records had to be erased and Simmons had to relinquish her badge, causing her to get choked up about it. The team were sent coordinates, believing them to be from [Nick Fury](/wiki/Nick_Fury), so they decided to head there. During their trip, Simmons and Triplett expressed their concerns for Coulson's plan, despite Fitz telling them to have faith in him. They soon landed at the location where Coulson spoke to his team, telling them how things were, and despite their doubts, the team still followed Coulson. As they made their way, Simmons took time to speak to Fitz, where she informed him that things were no longer the same. They then made it to the location, where they found a hidden base. When they entered, they were greeted by [Eric Koenig](/wiki/Eric_Koenig), telling them that they were at the [Providence](/wiki/Providence), one of Fury's secret bases. [[30]](#cite_note-AoS118-30) [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward) arrived at the Providence, badly injured, so Simmons performed first aid on him while he told them what had [happened](/wiki/Raid_of_the_Fridge) with [John Garrett](/wiki/John_Garrett) at the [Fridge](/wiki/Fridge). Ward then claimed that he had killed Garrett in the fight. The team were then required, by Koenig, to complete a lie detector test to confirm their allegiance. When it was Simmons' turn, she was asked for her reason being there, to which she revealed that she was not sure. Simmons, Fitz and Triplett were then briefed by Coulson about [Marcus Daniels](/wiki/Marcus_Daniels), one of the prisoners to escape from the Fridge. They then went to [Portland](/wiki/Portland) to apprehend Daniels, where Coulson informed them more about Daniels and his potential target, [Audrey Nathan](/wiki/Audrey_Nathan). Simmons and Triplett then arrived at Nathan's location, rescuing her from Daniels, posing as the [CIA](/wiki/CIA), while Coulson and Fitz unfortunately failed at subduing him. They then brought her to a safe location, where she uncovered that they were actually [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) and then told them about her history with Daniels stalking her and how she met Coulson. The team were able to defeat Daniels by luring him into a trap. The team then returned to find the Bus and the others gone. [[31]](#cite_note-AoS119-31) Grant Ward's Betrayal[ ] With some of their [team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team) missing, they began to search for them using the security footage, which were all erased, except for one showing the [Bus](/wiki/Bus). They saw [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) leave as well as [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward) and [Skye](/wiki/Skye) later on. Simmons decided to make some pancakes, discussing with [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) that they need to stay hopeful for [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)'s sake. As Simmons searched for some supplies, she came across [Eric Koenig](/wiki/Eric_Koenig)'s body, which she would deduct through an autopsy that Ward had killed him. They focused on locating Skye, who they realized was playing Ward. The team then were alerted of an incoming threat, which turned out to be a group of special forces, led by Colonel [Glenn Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot), who were informed of the bases location by [Maria Hill](/wiki/Maria_Hill). Simmons debated with Talbot, trying to tell him that they were not [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA), but it got them nowhere. Coulson and Hill then regrouped with them, and they all went to leave to find Skye. The team then went to a hotel in [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles) where Simmons and Fitz discussed Ward's betrayal, and the two reassured each other that they were not HYDRA. Coulson then decided that the team should take the night off and just relax after everything they have been through. [[32]](#cite_note-AoS120-32) The next morning, while watching the news, Simmons wondered why [Deathlok](/wiki/Deathlok) killed [Alejandro Castillo](/wiki/Alejandro_Castillo). Coulson Quinn](/wiki/Ian_Quinn), the [Clairvoyant](/wiki/Clairvoyant), [GH.325](/wiki/GH.325) and how it was all connected to [Cybertek](/wiki/Cybertek). The team then discussed a way to destroy everything the was on Skye's hard drive, infiltrating the [Cybertek Corporate Headquarters](/wiki/Cybertek_Corporate_Headquarters). After [Antoine Triplett](/wiki/Antoine_Triplett) obtained some of his grandfather's [Howling Commando Gear](/wiki/Howling_Commando_Gear), the team prepared to go to [Palo Alto](/wiki/Palo_Alto). As Coulson and May pretended to be former [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) scientists to stall for Skye, Simmons and Fitz provided them with what they needed to say to seem convincing. The team were able to retrieve the some files on Deathlok and made their escape. They then went through all the files and realized Garrett's plan was to heal himself and then create an army. The team then headed to [Havana](/wiki/Havana), [Cuba](/wiki/Cuba), learning that Garrett would be there. Simmons and Fitz found the Bus and informed Coulson, who ordered her to not engage. Simmons then had the idea to plant of the the [D.W.A.R.F.s](/wiki/D.W.A.R.F.s) on the Bus so they could track it, but before they could, Grant Ward captured them and took them aboard. Fitz activated an [EMP Joy Buzzer](/wiki/EMP_Joy_Buzzer) that fatally wounded Garrett, but as the two tried to hide in a [Medical Pod](/wiki/Medical_Pod), Ward cornered them and ejected them off the Bus into the Atlantic Ocean. [[33]](#cite_note-AoS121-33) Leo Fitz's Confession[ ] When Simmons awoke, [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) informed her that they had sunk to the bottom of the ocean and that he had broken his arm. When Simmons tried to suggest how to get out of there, Fitz told her that there isn't a lot of hope, even though he sent out a signal, as with the dissolving of [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.), no one would be listening. Fitz then came to the realization that they were going to die down there. The two then began to discuss what death would be like, providing comfort for each other. Simmons then came up with an idea of how to break the glass without the water pressure crushing them. However, Simmons then learned that only one of them would be able to survive, due to the amount of air left in a tank. The two argued over who should take it, causing Fitz to reveal his true feelings for her. Simmons, overwhelmed with emotions, embraced Fitz and tried to get him to think of another way, but he pushed the button, breaking the glass, forcing Simmons to take the last burst of air. However, Simmons was able to take Fitz with her and swim to the surface. They were then rescued by [Nick Fury](/wiki/Nick_Fury), who received the distress call. Simmons then woke up in a [Hyperbaric Chamber](/wiki/Hyperbaric_Chamber), on a jet heading back to the mainland. Fury then informed Simmons that Fitz was still alive and she told him of where to find [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson). After the [battle at Cybertek](/wiki/Battle_at_Cybertek), Simmons was reunited with the [team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team) as Coulson became the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. and they met [Billy Koenig](/wiki/Billy_Koenig) in the [Playground](/wiki/Playground). When asked about Fitz, Simmons only stated that he was alive. [[6]](#cite_note-AoS122-6) Rebuilding the Agency[ ] Undercover in HYDRA[ ] - \"Have you made friends?\" \"Oh, sir, you don't need to worry. I mean, it's been a tad lonely, true, but... You weren't asking out of concern of my feelings, were you?\" \"Undercover is all about the relationships you make. If you're gonna move up in [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA), you need to make friends.\" - [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Making_Friends_and_Influencing_People) When [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) would come out of his coma, he would not be the same, due to his injury. Simmons, not being able to work with Fitz the same, felt it would be best to give him some time apart so he could recover. [[34]](#cite_note-AoS201-34) So, Director [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) put Simmons on a top-secret assignment in which she was to infiltrate [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) at its deepest levels. Moving to a house at 1180 N. Marne Drive in Crosswell, [Delaware](/wiki/Delaware), she joined the science division and began working at the [HYDRA Laboratories](/wiki/HYDRA_Laboratories). When Coulson came for her routine debrief, Simmons informed him that HYDRA were looking into [Donnie Gill](/wiki/Donnie_Gill) and how he possessed special abilities. The next day, Simmons was taken to [Sunil Bakshi](/wiki/Sunil_Bakshi) for questioning, where they discovered that she already knew Gill. She was then questioned about her loyalties with [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.), to which she lied about. To see if they could trust her, Bakshi sent Simmons onto a [freighter](/wiki/Maribel_del_Mar) harboring Gill. She was able to talk to Gill, and Bakshi was able to activate his brainwashing. Simmons proved her trustworthiness and remained undercover, as well as obtaining a promotion. [[15]](#cite_note-AoS203-15) Weeks later, Simmons had an adjacent desk with her supervisor [Kenneth Turgeon](/wiki/Kenneth_Turgeon). They were ordered by Bakshi to attend a meeting that [Daniel Whitehall](/wiki/Daniel_Whitehall) was having with his top scientists, including Dr. [Lingenfelter](/wiki/Lingenfelter). Lingenfelter attempted to duplicate the effects of the [Obelisk](/wiki/Obelisk) from skin samples of one of its victims, a [waitress](/wiki/List_of_Minor_Characters#Heavy_is_the_Head), but the recent experiment they had conducted did not meet Whitehall's expectations. Whitehall asked Simmons for her expert opinion, to Turgeon's jealousy. Simmons assured him that the Obelisk could be made into a weapon of mass destruction. Simmons then sent [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) a message via [Flex Screen](/wiki/Flex_Screen), not knowing that [Raina](/wiki/Raina) was watching her. [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse), head of security, and Bakshi were alerted of a mole in the facility and searched everyone's desk. As Morse interrogated Simmons, Turgeon was dragged away, as a flex screen was found in his desk. Later, when Simmons exited the restroom, Morse continued to interrogate her, while Simmons continued to keep her cover. When Raina blew her cover, Bakshi sent a security team after her, causing her to try and escape. She was then cornered by Morse, who revealed herself to also be undercover, attacking the guards and helping her escape. The two jumped from the roof where a cloaked [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) piloted by [Antoine Triplett](/wiki/Antoine_Triplett) awaited them. At the [Playground](/wiki/Playground), [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) greeted Simmons with hesitancy. [[16]](#cite_note-AoS205-16) Uneasy Reunion with Leo Fitz[ ] Simmons watched over [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward) everyday since she got back, like she did before she left, where she noted that he had no way of knowing the time, but every morning at 5:30 he awoke and exercised. Simmons and [Skye](/wiki/Skye) then discussed Ward and her recent time undercover in [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) until they were interrupted by [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) alerting them that the [United Nations](/wiki/United_Nations) was attacked. Simmons noticed that the victims of the attack were disintegrated, she helped identify [Toshiro Mori](/wiki/Toshiro_Mori) from the hard drive that was obtained from [HYDRA Laboratories](/wiki/HYDRA_Laboratories). [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) asked her to learn more from the hard drive. Going to [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) for help in accessing the hard drive, the two started arguing about why Simmons left. She could not handle the conversation and left Fitz to his work. When Simmons returned, he and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) told her that the [Splinter Bombs](/wiki/Splinter_Bomb) were created by [Vincent Beckers](/wiki/Vincent_Beckers). Simmons went to the garage to thank Mackenzie for his help and his friendship with Fitz. Mackenzie told her that Fitz was better without her; she tearfully agreed. When Ward was being transferred to federal custody, Simmons promised to kill him if they ever met again. [[35]](#cite_note-AoS206-35) Helping Phil Coulson's Problems[ ] - \"Is all this really necessary?\" \"If you're going to insist on doing this, I'm going to be monitoring you very closely. It took me and [Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)six weeks to figure out how to operate [this](/wiki/Theta_Brain-Wave_Frequency_Machine), and quite honestly, I never thought we'd have to use it.\" - [Phil When brought the body of [Janice Robbins](/wiki/Janice_Robbins) so Simmons could perform an autopsy, she was still bitter about what Mackenzie had said to her previously. She then asked if anyone would like to leave, which everyone agreed to, not wanting to observe an autopsy. Simmons discovered that the cause of death was cardiac arrest, and noted that the carvings were similar to the ones [John Garrett](/wiki/John_Garrett) had made. She then discovered that Robbins and the killer both had [GH.325](/wiki/GH.325) in their blood. They then tried to find out more about the [Project T.A.H.I.T.I.](/wiki/Project_T.A.H.I.T.I.) by using the [Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine](/wiki/Theta_Brain-Wave_Frequency_Machine). Simmons reminded [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) that, after six months of research, she and Fitz still did not fully understand the machine. Coulson proceeded nonetheless and Simmons was stationed to watch his vitals as he recalled the past. When Coulson could no longer handle the experience, Simmons ordered the session to end. Afterwards, Simmons wondered where [Skye](/wiki/Skye) went, to then see her on the video monitor to Vault D, as Coulson locked her inside with the [Inertial Confinement Laser Barrier](/wiki/Inertial_Confinement_Laser_Barrier) and left. Simmons freed Skye, who went to chase the Director. Later, Simmons was among the assembled senior agents when Coulson gave the new mission: to find the city that matched the [Words of Creation](/wiki/Words_of_Creation) before [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) could. [[36]](#cite_note-AoS207-36) Familiar Face[ ] - \"This is decades of research and it's incomplete. But I did find the original [0-8-4](/wiki/0-8-4)report signed by Agent Carter herself.\" \"Anything I said? [Peggy Carter](/wiki/Peggy_Carter), founder, happens to be British, held this in her hand. No. Anyway, um... No Red Skull, but a lot of references to one of his commanders, [Werner Reinhardt](/wiki/Werner_Reinhardt).\" - Jemma Simmons Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse) interrogated [Sunil Bakshi](/wiki/Sunil_Bakshi), Simmons expressed her admiration for her being that close to him. When Morse believed to have uncovered something from Bakshi, Simmons suggested that they procure old [Strategic Scientific Reserve](/wiki/Strategic_Scientific_Reserve) files to find what connection [Daniel Whitehall](/wiki/Daniel_Whitehall) had to the [Red Skull](/wiki/Red_Skull), causing May to open Vault B. Simmons wasn't able to find any connection, however she loved that she was touching the same files as her hero and [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) founder [Peggy Carter](/wiki/Peggy_Carter). They continued to search through their files until [Lance Hunter](/wiki/Lance_Hunter) came across a picture of [Werner Reinhardt](/wiki/Werner_Reinhardt). Simmons realized that he was Whitehall; however, her research could not find the secret of Reinhardt's youth. [[37]](#cite_note-AoS208-37) Destroying the Kree City[ ] Simmons inspected [Antoine Triplett](/wiki/Antoine_Triplett)'s wounds when he returned to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground) from [Australia](/wiki/Australia) and told him that she was thankful that he survived his mission. Before Triplett could tell her about [Calvin Zabo](/wiki/Calvin_Zabo), [Skye](/wiki/Skye)'s father, Skye interrupted and the three discussed him together. Simmons was chosen to accompany [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) to [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico) to destroy the city that matched the [Words of Creation](/wiki/Words_of_Creation). While preparing for the trip, she shared with [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse) her feelings about [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), the coma he experienced, and how she was not ready for a relationship with him greater than friendship. Upon arrival, the silence between the two scientists caused [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) to leave them alone to talk privately. Tearfully, Simmons attempted to explain to Fitz why she left him to go undercover months ago; Fitz interrupted her to say that he could not work with her. She misinterpreted his statement and asked if he was quitting [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.); Fitz felt like it best that he work for her, making her leader of the science team. Inside [Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal](/wiki/Castillo_San_Crist%C3%B3bal), Simmons and Fitz prepared the [D.W.A.R.F.s](/wiki/D.W.A.R.F.s) to test the structural integrity of the city so when they destroyed it, it would not affect the residents of [San Juan](/wiki/San_Juan). When the drones lost power, Mackenzie was sent into the hundred foot shaft to investigate. Hearing his screams, he was hoisted up; Mackenzie then slapped Coulson across the room. During the battle, Simmons was hit and began to fall into the hole. Coulson, ordering Fitz to shoot the super-strong mechanic, grabbed Simmons and struggled to stop her fall. As Mackenzie approached Simmons and Coulson, Morse used her [battle staves](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse%27s_Battle_Staves) to electrocute him; stunned, he fell into the hundred foot hole just as Coulson saved Simmons. [[38]](#cite_note-AoS209-38) They then returned to the [Bus](/wiki/Bus), where Simmons and Fitz discussed the possibility of Mackenzie being alive, which Simmons believed could be due to a zombie-like influence over him. When the team planned to go back to the city, Simmons and Fitz provided containment suits, believing it will protect them from anything down there. Simmons, along with Fitz and [Antoine Triplett](/wiki/Antoine_Triplett), in containment suits, then went down to the [Kree City](/wiki/Kree_City) to plant explosives and to see if Mackenzie survived. However, it was taking too long for them to plant all the bombs, so Fitz decided that they split up. When Simmons and Triplett set their final bomb, they were soon reunited with Fitz, who had also set up all of his bombs with ten minutes to spare. However, when they discovered that Skye and Coulson were in the city, Triplett ran off to defuse the bombs. An earthquake occurred as she waited with Fitz, and they hugged in panic as the island shook, causing rubble to fall around them. [[39]](#cite_note-AoS210-39) Changing Opinions[ ] - \"I was so curious about powers, about unearthly biology, wondering where it might lead, hoping to better understand it, control it. I should have been trying to terminate it, erase it from existence.\" \"What? You... you've helped plenty of people with powers. It's... it's part of the world that we live in.\" \"It's a plague, Skye. All of it. It only ever brings us death.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Skye](/wiki/Skye) [[src]](/wiki/Aftershocks) Simmons was in charge of a team of scientists mapping the [Kree City](/wiki/Kree_City). Her teams planned to document, then flood the area so neither [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) nor any one else could harness it. When her team found the remains of [Antoine Triplett](/wiki/Antoine_Triplett), she shouted for them to handle it carefully. However, two scientists were dragged off and killed by a [transformed](/wiki/Terrigenesis) [Raina](/wiki/Raina). Simmons shot at Raina and managed to hit her several times; however, Raina still escaped up a lift. Simmons reported this to [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) who allowed her to return to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground), since Simmons wanted to check on [Skye](/wiki/Skye). Back at the Playground, Simmons told Skye, who was in quarantine, about her encounter with Raina. She showed her that Raina's genetic makeup had changed and said that aliens should be neutralized to prevent an epidemic. When Skye pointed out the harshness of her stated conclusion, Simmons told Skye that everything was her fault, including the death of Triplett, because of her interest in superpowers. She decided that instead of her dedicating half of her life trying to understand alien technology and biology, she should have been focused on trying to exterminate it. Skye tried to refute her claim pointing out that she had helped plenty people with powers; Simmons pointed out the hostile ones like [Donnie Gill](/wiki/Donnie_Gill), [Chan Ho Yin](/wiki/Chan_Ho_Yin), and [Carl Creel](/wiki/Carl_Creel). Simmons even noted that the [Avengers](/wiki/Avengers) themselves would not be necessary if they did not unleash an alien invasion on the world. As May and Coulson wondered what to do about Raina, Simmons voiced that killing Raina would not be the worst scenario. Simmons returned to Skye's cell when [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) brought her blood test results; the test said that Skye was normal. Unknown to Simmons, Fitz gave false results to quiet Simmons' possible fear of her until everyone would be more receptive of her [change](/wiki/Terrigenesis). Simmons and the other senior agents then sat remembering Triplett. Simmons told them all of a story Triplett had told her of a trip he went on with his grandfather.

She then informed [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) of a heavy artillery being loaded to take down the assailant as new [I.C.E.R.s](/wiki/I.C.E.R.) were being developed. When Simmons received a scan of what came off the assailant, she was able to determine that it wasn't blood, but [liquid nitrogen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/liquid_nitrogen). When [Skye](/wiki/Skye) and Morse returned from being defeated by the assailant, who they believe to be [Kree](/wiki/Kree), Simmons checked on Morse, who was knocked out from the attack. When they captured Vin-Tak, who restored Sif's memories and informed them of [Terrigenesis](/wiki/Terrigenesis) occurring on Earth, Simmons and Fitz inspected the [Diviner Box](/wiki/Diviner_Box), where they discovered that it was empty. Simmons assumed that all the [Diviners](/wiki/Diviner) were taken during the [1940s](/wiki/1940s). [[41]](#cite_note-AoS212-41) Leo Fitz's Lie[ ] - \" [Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)'s intentions were good.

Simmons then realized that Skye did go through a change in the [Kree City](/wiki/Kree_City) and that Fitz had known all this time. As they cleaned up the [Playground](/wiki/Playground), Fitz attempted to explain to Simmons why he lied to her, she, along with the rest of the team, told Fitz that they should have known, for their safety, meanwhile Skye overheard this argument. [[41]](#cite_note-AoS212-41) Discussing Fitz's actions with [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse), Simmons told her that science used to be sacred to Fitz and that Fitz would never have corrupted data or altered test results in the past, and that she would have to accept that he was different and that that their relationship would never return to the way it was.

When Doctor [Andrew Garner](/wiki/Andrew_Garner) was brought in to work with Skye, Simmons debriefed him of their current assessment on Skye. When Fitz observed [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) and Garner talking, he and Simmons discussed them, slowly improving their own relationship. However, they were interrupted by an alert from another outburst from Skye. When Skye began to become injured from her abilities, Simmons built a cast for her to help contain the shaking. When Simmons handed in Skye's Index file to Coulson, she suggested differentiating the types of candidates: 'Enhanced' for man made, and 'Gifted' for those with natural powers. Coulson told her it was a top priority to understand how to stop them and to keep it between themselves. [[42]](#cite_note-AoS213-42) Simmons began to work on [gauntlets](/wiki/Quake_Gauntlets), which would deliver minor electricity discharges which would lower the magnitude of Skye's abilities, keeping her from hurting herself. As Simmons checked over Skye's injuries, she and Fitz began to argue about Skye's control over her abilities. Simmons the completed the gloves, aware of some repercussions, and gave them to Coulson.

When [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse) caused a blackout in the [Playground](/wiki/Playground), Simmons was arming herself in the locker area, when Morse entered. Being aware of Morse's apparent betrayal, Simmons was therefore scared at first. She was able to calm herself, and act as though she was oblivious to the true unfolding events.

They were then surprised by the arrival of [Anne Weaver](/wiki/Anne_Weaver), who asked Simmons for her medical expertise on [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie); she first looked at Fitz and waited for his approval before going to attend to Mackenzie.

Morse assured them that Fitz would be free to go; however, they both left, refusing to help Gonzales. When Fitz decided to leave, Simmons and Morse talked while he packed. Morse seemingly convinced Simmons to stay and help to open the Toolbox. Instead, Simmons, stalled the process and replicated the box in order to smuggle it out of the [Playground](/wiki/Playground) with Fitz. When Fitz learned what she was doing, he covered her actions and convinced [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) and Morse that Simmons was in earnest. She later packed Fitz's favorite sandwich in his bag, and helped him get the backpack on. She watched with Morse and Mack as Fitz left the Playground.

May told her that she would handle it. Simmons continued her false attempts to open the Toolbox as May and [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse) entered the lab, but May told her she could stop because she had told Morse the truth. May and Morse asked her if she could hack into [Deathlok](/wiki/Deathlok)'s hard-drive so they could have an opportunity to see, through him, where Coulson was. Simmons said it should not be too hard and dumped the fake Toolbox in the trash. While Simmons worked on her mission, May came to ask her if there was any luck. Simmons argued with her that she was on [Robert Gonzales](/wiki/Robert_Gonzales)' side, but May said that she the only reason why she helped him was because of Coulson's lies. Simmons told her she didn't care of what was inside the Toolbox but the only thing she knew was that Coulson was just trying to protect [Skye](/wiki/Skye). Simmons, May, Morse and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) were in Coulson's office when Skye called abruptly and said she was with [Calvin Zabo](/wiki/Calvin_Zabo) and [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) needed to take him from where she was.

They talked together about Ward and Agent 33's relationship as well as Fitz telling her that he attacked Ward. Simmons, confused on how Coulson could work with Ward, then explained to Fitz how she could kill Ward with a [Splinter Bomb](/wiki/Splinter_Bomb). Fitz realized that she was serious about the idea, but Simmons said she was only arming herself against Ward. Knowing she would have an opportunity to kill Ward, Simmons obtained a Splinter Bomb and asked Coulson if she could join the mission to infiltrate the [Arctic HYDRA Research Facility](/wiki/Arctic_HYDRA_Research_Facility) and rescue [Deathlok](/wiki/Deathlok). Coulson agreed she could come to look after Peterson's injuries. The team, which comprised of the original members of [Coulson's Team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team), boarded the [Bus](/wiki/Bus) where they heard a loud noise, which was revealed to be [Skye](/wiki/Skye), who had been teleported to assist them with the mission and to rescue her friend, [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell). On their way to the base, Simmons and Fitz talked with Skye about the [place](/wiki/Afterlife) she had been. Coulson asked Ward to give the information about the base sent by [Sunil Bakshi](/wiki/Sunil_Bakshi), who Ward had brainwashed into serving him. Ward began, but then started to explain his actions during the time it had been revealed he was a [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) agent. Ward asked for the team's forgiveness, but nobody gave it. Near the base, HYDRA spotted the Bus' location and sent missiles to shoot it down, but the team escaped with a [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) and entered the base. In the base, the team joined Bakshi and they were split into two groups: Coulson, [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) and Fitz went to take down the defense system so [Robert Gonzales](/wiki/Robert_Gonzales)' men could destroy the base, while Simmons, Skye, Ward, and Bakshi went to find Peterson and Campbell. Bakshi led them to a room where Peterson was, but HYDRA agents shot in their direction. Skye used her powers to knock them out and they found Peterson in his cell with Peterson unable to stand due to the torture he had endured. Simmons asked Ward to find something with which she could take Peterson, in order to make a distraction and kill Ward with a Splinter Bomb. While Ward had his back turned and was distracted searching the base, Simmons sneaked into the room and prepared to kill him with the Splinter Bomb; however when she threw the Splinter Bomb, Bakshi sacrificed his own life for Ward's, jumping in front of him and having his body turned to dust within seconds. Simmons attempted to puller her gun on Ward, but he already had his pointed at her. He demanding to know why she had tried to kill him, so Simmons reminded him of her vow to kill him. Instead of shooting her, he lectured her and told her that he was disappointed in the change in her. He then allowed her to live and left the base. With Ward gone, Simmons went to help Skye rescue Campbell and Peterson before Gonzales destroyed the base. With the base was destroyed, Simmons and the team returned to the Playground. Simmons and Fitz talked with Peterson about repairing his [leg](/wiki/Cybertek_Prosthetic_Leg), which had been removed and destroyed by Doctor [List](/wiki/List) and his HYDRA scientists.

Palamas thanked them and asked Simmons about her undercover mission in HYDRA with [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse), but before Simmons could explain more, the light of the building turned on and off, as Campbell awoke from his coma.

Coulson came to check Simmons' progress with analyzing the formula and Simmons gave him a partial list of the chemicals in the formula, saying Zabo made an unsuccessful attempt to get super strength. Coulson asked if he would be alright but Simmons said he had taken three vials so he should be dead. When Zabo had a heart attack, Simmons tried to revive him by giving him an adrenaline syringe. Zabo's heart went back to work but he became monstrous with remarkable strength.

After twenty-two hours, she noted that the sun had not risen, questioning the length of the nights on the planet. Simmons would then continue to wait for another forty-nine hours, becoming angry at not seeing a sun, causing her to breakdown. By seventy-nine hours, Simmons assessed that a normal [human](/wiki/Humans) can live without water for one hundred hours, so she then became focused on survival, leaving a trail in case someone does find her. By the eighty-first hour, Simmons began to talk to herself about the date they had planned with Fitz. She then found water after one hundred and one hours. She then began to desperately drink from a small pond, relieved in her success. At one hundred nine hours, Simmons decided to swim in the pond, finally finding time to relax. Suddenly, she was grabbed by a [creature](/wiki/Tentacled_Creature) in the water and almost drowned; Simmons fought it, detached a tentacle, and then decided to eat it. After four hundred and minty-two hours, Simmons continued to make her talk to Fitz, realizing that she would need to find some food or she would grow weak and die. Simmons crafted herself a weapon and returned to the pond to kill the creature that attacked her. She successfully defeated the creature and celebrated her victory.

Simmons continued to wait in the cage for twenty-two hours, until the man came to check on her and realized that she was real. She demanded the man to let her out, but he left her. After forty-one hours of being in the cage, Simmons began to exercise until the man returned. Simmons introduced herself and the man brought her food. After eight hundred and fifty-one hours, Simmons then formed a plan to escape. She faked a stomachache and lured the man into the cage to investigate. Simmons hit the man with the food bowl and escaped the cage, exiting the cave and running from the man. However, she fell and hurt her leg, allowing the man to catch up to her. He then began to tend to her wound and brought her back to the cave. The man introduced himself as Will Daniels and Simmons stitched up her leg.

During dinner, the two discussed what they miss most from Earth, Daniels telling her the sun. The two then watched a video of her birthday celebration. The two then discussed Fitz and his relationship with Simmons, which she stated that they were inseparable. Three thousand and ten hours on the planet, Simmons continued to figure a way off the planet, getting frustrated at her lack of results. Simmons then declared that she wanted to go to the \"no fly zone\", believing an answer to be there, which Daniels strongly refused. While walking around the planet, Simmons discovered a sword in the ground, along with numerous object buried under the sand. When a sandstorm occurred, Simmons noticed a mysterious figure in the dust. She started to run away from it, where she received a head injury, which she treated by applying dirt to it. She made it back to Daniels and told him that she believed him. Simmons then explained her plan to Daniels, thinking of using his equipment and her phone to calculate new portal openings. She then decided to watch the video on her phone one more time before using all of its power to start the computers. [[7]](#cite_note-AoS305-7) Fleeing \"Death\"[ ] - \"There's no hope on this [planet](/wiki/Maveth).\" \"That's what I used to think. Then you showed up.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels) [[src]](/wiki/4,722_Hours) The two would then continue to work on a way to turn on his computer for one hundred and seventy-three hours. Once it was activated, they calculated the movement of the stars and tried to locate the next place the portal would open. After the battery of her phone was dead, she found the location and the time of the next portal, in the \"no fly zone\". [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels) explained to her that a canyon separated between them and the portal. Three hundred and eighty hours later, they prepared to go there, Simmons telling Daniels of her reason for getting into science, as well as her theory of how the portal works. Simmons told him that she had a message in bottle for Fitz in case they would not reach to the portal. When they arrived to the canyon, it was longer than they expected. Daniels thought that [It](/wiki/Hive) caused it. The portal opened in the other side, and Daniels shot the bottle at the portal, but it was closed before the bottle could reach it. Defeated, they then returned to their hideout where Simmons admitted that there was no hope in this planet, stating that it was hell. Daniels told her that he had also thought so, until he met her. The two then kissed, and from then on, began a relationship with each other. Accepting no chance of ever leaving, Simmons would then adjust to a new life with Daniels on Maveth. [[7]](#cite_note-AoS305-7) Rescued[ ] - \" [Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)would never have found her, but she saw the flare.\" - [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) [[src]](/wiki/Purpose_in_the_Machine) Trapped on [Maveth](/wiki/Maveth) for four thousand, seven hundred and twenty hours, Simmons conducted, due to research into the stars, when the sun was due to rise over the planet, the first sunrise in eighteen years. The pair shared a kiss as they stepped outside and waited to see for the sun for the first time on the planet. Suddenly Simmons spotted a flair being fired in the distance and determined it must be [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) finally having found her. Simmons ran across the desert with [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels) as they tried to find the source of the flare, but became separated as a sandstorm appeared. Simmons spotted what appeared to be a [NASA](/wiki/NASA) astronaut and called out to Daniels that his team had found him, but Daniels warned her that it could only be the [deadly being](/wiki/Hive) on the planet trying to trick her mind. Daniels ordered Simmons to run as he drew his gun and engaged the creature, firing his only bullet at It while Simmons followed the sound of Fitz's voice. [[7]](#cite_note-AoS305-7) She moved towards the light and encountered Fitz, who had thrown himself into the [activated portal](/wiki/Monolith) to find her. Crawling to him as the sandstorm worsened, she tried to reach him, only for him to be pulled away from her as the rope he was attached to began to take him back. Refusing to give up, Simmons dragged herself back towards Fitz, and they both grabbed hold of each other's hands and made it back through the portal before it exploded. Safe in the [English](/wiki/England) castle, Simmons hugged Coulson and Morse ran tests on Simmons and determined that she was not infected or contagious and everything was normal despite her many months on a distant planet they knew nothing about. Suddenly, Simmons awakened from a nightmare and she held a piece of metal shaped like a shiv in a defensive position. She regained her senses and looked around; she found herself in a [Medical Pod](/wiki/Medical_Pod) with Fitz in a chair, sleeping next to her bed. Simmons laid her head near his lap and returned to sleep, comforted by his presence. [[52]](#cite_note-AoS302-52) Return to Earth[ ] A team checked her physical condition and determined that her body adapted to living on the other planet. Simmons took a shower and washed the filth on her body. [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) accompanied her in every step she made since she was still getting used to [Earth](/wiki/Earth)'s lower gravity. They walked to the lab where [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse) greeted her. Fitz theorized that if she saw the lab again, she would feel better. When Morse's phone rang, Simmons heard the ring a lot louder then what it was, due to her still adjusting to [Earth](/wiki/Earth)'s differences from [Maveth](/wiki/Maveth). Simmons sent her regards to [Lance Hunter](/wiki/Lance_Hunter), who called Morse to update her on his campaign to kill [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward). Simmons then told Fitz that she did not want to be there as there were too many distractions. Even a small divisive sounded very loud to her, so Fitz took her to her room. In her room, Simmons was visited by [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson); at first, Simmons called her \"Skye\" but she corrected herself. Johnson said to her that she would be with her any time when she would want to talk about what happened to her. Simmons said that she would rather listen about the [Inhuman Outbreak](/wiki/Inhuman_Outbreak). Johnson asked again if she was alright, which Simmons informed her that there was a lot that was hard to talk about. Suddenly, Johnson received a call, startling Simmons and interrupting them, however Simmons assured her to take it. [[53]](#cite_note-AoS303-53) Dinner Date[ ] [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) took Simmons to a restaurant as he had promised to her months ago. When Simmons asked him where were all the other people, he said that he made sure there would not be any distractions. After they sat, Simmons said that she did not know how to thank him enough for what he had done for her. Fitz said that she did not have to say anything. Fitz then suggested to drink the wine, [[53]](#cite_note-AoS303-53) but it reminded her of how she and [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels) drank the old wine. [[7]](#cite_note-AoS305-7) She started to cry, so Fitz sat next to her and comforted her. [[53]](#cite_note-AoS303-53) Return to Danger[ ] Working on a Way Back[ ] - \"I have to go [back](/wiki/Maveth).\" - Jemma Simmons to [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse) [[src]](/wiki/A_Wanted_(Inhu)man) Simmons knew that she had to find a way to open the [portal](/wiki/Monolith) again to save [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels)'s life. She examined the Monolith remains in the lab. But when [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse) came and assured her that it will not open again, Simmons said that it had to and she must go back to the planet. Simmons researched the fragments of the Monolith and wrote her findings in a notebook. [[53]](#cite_note-AoS303-53) Therapy[ ] - \"It was bitter, not sweet at all. I'd imagine the taste of a fresh strawberry for months, but like most things since being back, it just wasn't what I'd remembered.\" \"Most things aren't.\" - Jemma [[src]](/wiki/Devils_You_Know) Simmons then met with [Andrew Garner](/wiki/Andrew_Garner), where she discussed how many thing were no like how she remembered them while on the [planet](/wiki/Maveth). He then asked about how she was going, looking for signs of PTSD, which she assured she wasn't having any. When Garner went through stories of people who had survived difficult situations through hope, Simmons commented that she did lose hope while trapped. When Garner attempted to learn more about why, Simmons insisted on moving on, rather than focusing on the past. [[54]](#cite_note-AoS304-54) Keeping Secrets[ ] While researching [Lash](/wiki/Lash), [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) found the notebook and asked [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse) what it was. Suddenly, Simmons entered the laboratory and grabbed the notebook from Fitz; the papers fell to the floor and were scattered. Simmons became upset and told Fitz to leave her things alone before storming off. Fitz was left perplexed. Simmons went to see Morse who was in the middle of her rehabilitation regiment and apologized for accusing her of betraying their secret to Fitz. Morse thought nothing of it, but confided to Simmons that she believed that [Lance Hunter](/wiki/Lance_Hunter) was in danger. Later, Simmons was in her room reorganizing the notebook when Fitz entered, wanting to know what was happening. Simmons realized that she could not rescue [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels) without assistance. [[54]](#cite_note-AoS304-54) Telling Leo Fitz About Will Daniels[ ] - \"Something happened to me, Fitz, on the [other side](/wiki/Maveth). It's time I told you the truth, about everything.\" - Jemma Simmons to [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) [[src]](/wiki/Devils_You_Know) [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) questioned her on why she wanted to rebuild the [Monolith](/wiki/Monolith), so Simmons told him about her experience on [Maveth](/wiki/Maveth) and the relationship that she had with [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels). For a moment, Fitz would not talk to her and she began to cry. Collecting herself, Simmons chased after Fitz, begging him to understand; Fitz said that he did understand and showed her his computer screen, revealing the research he had done over the past six months on her location. Fitz declared that they will save Daniels; Simmons smiled. [[7]](#cite_note-AoS305-7) Awaiting Results[ ] Simmons sat across from [Andrew Garner](/wiki/Andrew_Garner) reminding him of his words as she played psychologist; Garner confessed to her that he disliked how others were treating him since he was injured in an [assassination attempt](/wiki/Attack_on_Andrew_Garner). Simmons told him that others underestimate how strong smart people truly are. She then received a phone call from [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) who had a blood sample from [Luther Banks](/wiki/Luther_Banks) that she wanted tested to determine if he could be an [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans). Simmons took the assignment and ran the test. Simmons entered the workplace and told Johnson that Banks was not an Inhuman. Simmons asked [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) how the research he was doing into the [Monolith](/wiki/Monolith) was progressing. He could only tell her that the computer simulations had not yet found a way to open a viable portal. Simmons then told Fitz that if he knew [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels), then he would understand why she desperately hopes to rescue him; Fitz assured her that he will get to know Daniels. Unknown to Simmons, Fitz was researching Daniels' background. [[55]](#cite_note-AoS306-55) Simmons was on her way to the lab when she ran into Garner, who reassured her that it was good that she told Fitz about what happened on [Maveth](/wiki/Maveth). When she arrived, Simmons gave her phone to Fitz and hoped that he could repair it; she told him that she made logs on it during her time on Maveth and that she thought he could use that information to find a way to open a portal. Fitz took the phone and said he would do the research. [[9]](#cite_note-AoS307-9) Watching the Sunrise[ ] Later, Simmons searched the [Playground](/wiki/Playground) for an eastern window so she could watch the sunrise. [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) found her and told her that he was taking a break. He then questioned her about her thought processes and state of mind as she recorded her logs. Simmons, knowing that Fitz was referring to her affirmations of love to him and her said desire to start a family with him, told Fitz that she had perfect clarity when she made her logs. The two then watched as the morning began. [[9]](#cite_note-AoS307-9) Discovering an Unlikely Connection[ ] - \"You wait until I'm bound for a [war](/wiki/War_Against_the_Inhumans)on an [aircraft carrier](/wiki/Iliad), and then you get swept off to some [far-flung planet](/wiki/Maveth). With [him](/wiki/Will_Daniels). Top-marks pilot astronaut anything-\" you love I think... Yes.\" - [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Many_Heads,_One_Tale) As Simmons looked at a photo of her with [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels), she watched as [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) berated an agent who had dropped some books and scrolls in the hallway. Simmons calmed him down and he told her about a way of figuring out the origin of the symbol he discovered. Simmons was present at a debrief from Coulson on initiating [Operation Spotlight](/wiki/Operation_Spotlight), an infiltration of the [Advanced Threat Containment Unit](/wiki/Advanced_Threat_Containment_Unit). Simmons and Fitz then continued to work on location the origin of the symbol, until she discovered that it was connected to a sacrificial ritual, tracing back thousands of years. As Fitz continued to work on a way to bring back Daniels, Simmons became angry with him and left the room. Simmons returned to the lab; however, Fitz confronted her there, asking her why she was angry with him. Simmons replied that she was mad at herself for asking Fitz to help, and she was mad at him for being so willing. Simmons told Fitz she had expected him to get angry, and he had not. Simmons listened as Fitz replied that he was angry, but not at her; at the universe that he believed kept them apart. Simmons deflected the idea; however, Fitz proceeded to list all their obstacles, before asking Simmons if she loved Daniels. Taken aback, Simmons struggled to find an answer, until finally saying yes. Fitz sadly agreed and started listing Daniels' achievements and traits, until Simmons cut him off and interjected that Fitz had rescued her from [Maveth](/wiki/Maveth). Fitz stared at her for a second, and then kissed her, knocking a book off the table as he did. Simmons kissed him back, until Fitz broke away and whispered again that they were cursed. As he walked away, Simmons turned and saw the book that had been knocked down lying open with a picture of a symbol similar to [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA)'s; she called Fitz back and showed him the picture. Later, Simmons and Fitz showed the rest of the agents their findings, first laying out the [Project Distant Star Return](/wiki/Project_Distant_Star_Return) insignia, then other symbols relating to the [Monolith](/wiki/Monolith) they had found in their research, progressing until they reached a symbol that bore extreme similarity to the current HYDRA symbol. Their research revealed that HYDRA had been involved with [NASA](/wiki/NASA) and the [ATCU](/wiki/ATCU), and that they were behind sending people through the Monolith. [[56]](#cite_note-AoS308-56) Reviewing Grant Ward[ ] - \"You were attracted to him.\" \"Well, he did jump out of a plane to save me.\" \"Ever think the feeling might have been mutual?\" \"That's not Ward needed from me. Besides, it was obvious he fancied [someone else](/wiki/Quake).\" - the original members of [his team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team) to interrogate them about Ward to try and uncover anything to help understand him. When Simmons was brought in, Coulson proceeded to ask her questions, including addressing her relationship with Ward after he saved her life. Simmons stated that she was attracted to him, but he never reciprocated those feelings, rather being attracted to [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson). Coulson then wrapped his interrogation with Simmons, obtaining everything he required from her and moved on to Johnson next. [[57]](#cite_note-AoS309-57) [Ambush at the Distant Star Facility](/wiki/Ambush_at_the_Distant_Star_Facility)[ ] When she was done, she returned to the lab with [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) where [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) brought in [Luther Banks](/wiki/Luther_Banks) to see if he knew of the symbol that they recently discovered, which revealed to be associated with [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA). Banks informed them that it was from a program called [Project Distant Star Pathfinder](/wiki/Project_Distant_Star_Return), a [NASA](/wiki/NASA) program Banks was apart of. He revealed that no one was running the program, but that it was funded by [Gideon Malick](/wiki/Gideon_Malick). Banks told them the facility had been shut down for a while, but Simmons decided that it was worth them investigating Coulson sent Simmons, Fitz, Banks, and a team of agents to an abandoned [Project Distant Star Pathfinder facility](/wiki/Distant_Star_Facility) in search of clues to the [Monolith](/wiki/Monolith). They then arrived, where Simmons expressed her belief that it was unlikely they would find anything portal related, but Fitz replied that they still could find something to help them bring back Daniels. Simmons told him that they could not bring him back, since opening the portal was HYDRA's goal and could potentially allow them to bring back [their leader](/wiki/Hive). Though Fitz tried to protest, saying that it was important to get Daniels back, Simmons assured him that she wanted to bring the man that saved her, but told him that it would be selfish to potentially allow HYDRA to achieve their goal. Before Fitz could respond, the two heard shots. Quickly turning, Simmons and Fitz saw Banks shoot the other agents, and he then turned the gun on the two. Simmons watched as Fitz asked Banks not to shoot them; however, Banks managed to say it was not him before the gun floated out of his hand, turned, and shot Banks in the head. Shocked at the sudden mysterious attack, Simmons and Fitz watched as [R. Giyera](/wiki/R._Giyera) entered the room and ordered them to follow him, taking them captive. [[57]](#cite_note-AoS309-57) Kidnapped[ ] - \"They don't know how to get back.\" \"You really are a sharp cookie. Maybe now you're ready to reveal the secret.\" \"Come a lot closer and find out.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Gideon Malick](/wiki/Gideon_Malick) [[src]](/wiki/Closure) Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) were then taken captive by [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) where they met [Gideon Malick](/wiki/Gideon_Malick), who was working with [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward). Malick questioned Simmons on her time on [Maveth](/wiki/Maveth), asking if she had seen [Hive](/wiki/Hive), but she tried to attack him, but was unsuccessful. He told them that they sought to use fragments of the [Monolith](/wiki/Monolith) to summon forth the hostile creature from Maveth; the creature was in fact an [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans) of unspeakable power that HYDRA and its ancestors had long worshiped. However, they were never able to bring anyone back from the Maveth, so they required their help. Simmons and Fitz strongly refused the prospect, causing Ward to have them split up. Simmons was then tied up and interrogated by Ward, who stated that he would never hurt her. He then brought in [R. Giyera](/wiki/R._Giyera) to do it for him. He then began to torture her, using his telekinetic abilities to do so. Simmons managed to hold out, but when Ward entered, furious, he began to torture her. She was then brought to Malick, who was preparing to open the portal, warning them about the dangers of doing so. She then discovered that Fitz had decided to help them, stopping her torture. Simmons begged Fitz to not help them, but he refused to let her be killed. While Simmons remained behind in captivity, she watched as Fitz was forced to accompany a squadron of HYDRA operatives led by Ward through the portal, with [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) airdropping through the castle roof after them seconds later to stop them. [[57]](#cite_note-AoS309-57) At the HYDRA Castle[ ] - \"In case you didn't realize, [Melinda](/wiki/Melinda_May)shot me!\" \"Oh, well, I think you deserved it after the way you've misbehaved!\" - [Andrew Garner](/wiki/Andrew_Garner)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Maveth_(episode)) While they waited for the team to return, the [HYDRA Castle](/wiki/HYDRA_Castle) suddenly fell under [attack by S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/Attack_on_the_HYDRA_Castle) and [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell), who used his electrical powers to cut the power to the facility. In the confusion, Simmons escaped her confinements using the dagger she had taken from [Maveth](/wiki/Maveth). Evading [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) forces, she came across captive [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans), including [Andrew Garner](/wiki/Andrew_Garner), who was secured in his [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module). With HYDRA forces closing in on her, Simmons got into a brief argument with Garner, who offered to protect her from HYDRA if she let him out. Simmons was understandably skeptical, given Garner's recent actions as Lash. However, seeing no other alternative, she complied and remained hidden as Garner transformed into Lash and butchered all HYDRA operatives in his path. As Lash disappeared from the scene, Simmons regrouped with the rest of her team and aided in securing the facility. As [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) took point in guarding the portal, Simmons told her team of the nature of HYDRA's plans and of the hostile Inhuman. After a length deliberation, the team decided to bomb the castle once [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) returned, thus destroying the portal and preventing the Inhuman from making it through. Simmons accompanied the away team while [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) stayed behind to oversee the return of their people. Eventually, time ran out and S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed the castle. Fortunately, Coulson and Fitz returned at the last second and regrouped with the others on the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One). Simmons immediately went to see if they had successfully brought back [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels), but was heartbroken to discover he was not with them. In tears, she embraced Fitz, who comforted her. [[58]](#cite_note-AoS310-58) Lab Work[ ] Missing Leo Fitz[ ] As [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) sent Simmons footage of an [Inhuman](/wiki/Elena_Rodriguez) with super-speed, she redefined the [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module). She told [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell) that it was necessary, since the [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans)' abilities were random. However, Campbell told her that he had been taught that the Inhumans abilities were given to create an equilibrium within the species. Then, [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) wanted to use the [Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine](/wiki/Theta_Brain-Wave_Frequency_Machine) [Werner von Strucker](/wiki/Werner_von_Strucker) to find out where [Gideon Malick](/wiki/Gideon_Malick) was. Simmons warned him that because von Strucker was in a coma, it could be dangerous for him. Eventually, Coulson got his information. Later, Simmons found [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) in the lab, and told him that she missed their partnership because of the recent events. Fitz said that maybe there had been a way to save [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels), but Simmons said that he was extraordinary, since he had killed [Hive](/wiki/Hive). Together, they restored the moment they had met, reintroducing themselves in an effort to start over. [[59]](#cite_note-AoS311-59) Potential Cure[ ] - \"Um, there's something going on with [Creel](/wiki/Carl_Creel)'s DNA sample. I could really use a doctor who understands [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans)biology.\" - Jemma Simmons to [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell) [[src]](/wiki/The_Inside_Man) [Carl Creel](/wiki/Carl_Creel) was brought to the inside a [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module). Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) asked him about his powers and how he could touch the [Diviner](/wiki/Diviner) without being killed, but he did not know. They decided to test his blood samples with [Terrigenesis](/wiki/Terrigenesis). She then interrupted [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) and [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell) and asked Campbell's help with their test. The two showed Campbell that Johnson's pre- [Terrigenesis](/wiki/Terrigenesis) blood reacted to the Terrigen, but as they mixed it with Creel's blood, it broke down the Terrigenesis. They theorized that it could be a vaccine to [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans) that were not yet transformed. Johnson entered the lab, shocked at the idea. Simmons and Fitz left the room to let her and Campbell talk. [[60]](#cite_note-AoS312-60) Mission in Russia[ ] - \"Could be a psychic ability at work here.\" \"Rather than physical, yeah.\" 'Yeah, but if [he](/wiki/Androvich)can snap bones without laying a finger on you, then the [Prime Minister](/wiki/Dimitri_Olshenko)'s in real danger.\" - [Siberia](/wiki/Siberia) and the rest of the team followed them on [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One). They went to a compound, where Hunter and [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) found the body of the [Prime Minister](/wiki/Dimitri_Olshenko) of [Russia](/wiki/Russia)'s [Attach\u00e9](/wiki/Yuri_Krupin). They sent his biological condition to Simmons, who found out that he had been choked without a touch by an [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans) [assassin](/wiki/Androvich) in the compound. Then, [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) sent her a footage of the Inhuman. Simmons tried to figured out his powers, believing them to be some kind of psychic ability. She realized he could manifest [Darkforce](/wiki/Darkforce) in form of his shadow. She delivered the information to the team on the ground, informing them that they won't be able to destroy the manifestation. [[61]](#cite_note-AoS313-61) Spy's Goodbye[ ] - \"Oh, it's Jemma. can't.\" Hunter](/wiki/Lance_Hunter) Hunter](/wiki/Lance_Hunter) were arrested. [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) went to free them, but he returned to [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) alone. He informed the team the pair were disavowed from [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) in order to keep it a secret. Later, the team visited [a bar](/wiki/Teddy%27s_Bar) where Morse and Hunter were. Without directly contacting them, Simmons and the others all ordered shots for the two, saying goodbye in the only way they could. After they all said their goodbyes and getting emotional, they all departed the bar. [[61]](#cite_note-AoS313-61) Shooting Practice[ ] - \"I'm quite comfortable blaming myself, actually, for the lot of it. For all the miseries endured to [rescue](/wiki/Rescue_of_Jemma_Simmons)helpless little Agent Simmons. [Will](/wiki/Will_Daniels)died trying to save me. And [Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)...

May asked her why she was doing it, and Simmons said that since she could not defend herself, when she let [Lash](/wiki/Lash) out and kill innocent people, she needed to know how to use a gun. May told her that it was not her fault and left. After she was finished, Simmons was called by May. May told her she assign some of [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) services to find Lash. Simmons agreed to help May and told her she used them wrong, since Lash was driven by basic instincts. Simmons asked her what she was planning to do with him, so she answered that she would kill him. Simmons told her about the vaccine for pre- [Terrigenesis](/wiki/Terrigenesis) [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans) she was working at that could help Lash, but May refused, not wanting to be given hope. [[62]](#cite_note-AoS314-62) [Hive's Campaign](/wiki/Hive%27s_Campaign)[ ] Daisy Johnson's Visions[ ] When [Daisy visions of the future from the [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans) [Charles Hinton](/wiki/Charles_Hinton), she returned to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground) and told the team was she saw. Johnson told the, she would [fight](/wiki/Battle_at_the_Transia_Corporation_Building) [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) to rescue Hinton and that Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) would hold hands in the snow. Johnson said they could change the future from happening, but Fitz explained to the team the future could not be changed. [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) suggested they would send [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) to the mission instead of Johnson, as well as ordering Simmons and Fitz not to go in the snow, attempting to alter the predicted future. Johnson gave details of the location of the battle to Simmons and Fitz, and they used [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) services to find it. May entered the room and demanded they would not use all of them. Simmons explained that she and May were using some of the services to find [Lash](/wiki/Lash). Simmons asked May if she thought they could change the future, to which May replied that every move they made change the future. Suddenly, the wife of Hinton, [Polly](/wiki/Polly_Hinton), was brought in to the Playground. The team gathered in Coulson's office as they watched Johnson talk with Polly about her husband and his abilities. Simmons joined Fitz, [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell) and others as they began training to ensure May would undergo her mission as fast as possible in order to change the vision's outcome. Johnson made sure the room was laid out as accurately as possible to the vision she had had while Fitz and the other agents acted as the guards who needed to be taken out. As they practiced, Simmons and Fitz discussed the chances of being able to alter the future. Eventually they were able to replicate the events perfectly, with May managing to beat the time limit. They then found the location of the battle, which was owned by [Transia Corporation](/wiki/Transia_Corporation). Coulson gave his last orders to May when suddenly the alarms in the base went off, telling them that there was an intruder. [Andrew Garner](/wiki/Andrew_Garner) was brought into the base and explained that Lash was taking over and he wanted to say goodbye to May. May was ordered to stay behind so she could say goodbye to her ex-husband while Johnson went into the mission. In Coulson's s office they watched as they managed to hack into the Transia Corporation's CCTV feed. As they spotted [R. Giyera](/wiki/R._Giyera) on the feed, suddenly the video seemed to show [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward) in the building. Fitz claimed it was likely to be [Hive](/wiki/Hive). Simmons was then terrified of what Johnson is going into. They went to the building to save Johnson and find Hive. Coulson and Campbell went to help Johnson, while Simmons and Fitz stayed outside, Fitz commenting on the lack of clouds, believing their would not be snow. Simmons would then suggest to him that maybe Johnson had seen her own death in the visions. Suddenly, Fluorescent sparkles fell from the building's rooftop, so Fitz realized what Johnson actually saw instead of snow. Simmons then informed him that they're supposed to hold hands now, so the two did. [[63]](#cite_note-AoS315-63) Learning about Hive[ ] - \"The organisms we found on the bones, I don't think [he](/wiki/Hive)'s controlling them. I think he is them.\" - Jemma to skeletons sentenced the skin by [Hive](/wiki/Hive). Simmons explained that [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward)'s body was possessed by the [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans) from [Maveth](/wiki/Maveth). The team was called to [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)'s office for a meeting where he explained that in order to find Hive, they would go to [GT Agrochemical](/wiki/GT_Agrochemical) facility which had been raided by [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA). On [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), Simmons and Fitz explained to Coulson that Hive had created small organisms which had consumed the victims' flesh. Simmons theorized that the organisms also been used to reanimate dead flesh. Coulson looked at her shocked so Simmons explained she could not believe Hive was on [Earth](/wiki/Earth). As the team prepared to enter to facility and to face [R. Giyera](/wiki/R._Giyera) there, Simmons explained to them his powers. [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) asked her about a room in the facility where she could defeat him. After they kidnapped Giyera, Simmons was asked by Giyera why Hive destroyed the researches in the facility, so Simmons said either he wanted to use them, or he was afraid of them. Coulson then asked what Hive was, so Simmons said she was thinking the little organisms were Hive himself. Coulson realized Hive was a parasite which possessed the memories of his host. Simmons herself was terrified of the idea. Later, the alarm of the plane was set off as Giyera escaped the [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module). Giyera came to the the control room and managed to control the plane. He forced the plane to fly downwards at an intense speed, causing Simmons to faint. [[64]](#cite_note-AoS316-64) After violently landing in the secret base of [Gideon Malick](/wiki/Gideon_Malick) in [Schoonebeek Oil Field](/wiki/Schoonebeek_Oil_Field), Simmons, Fitz, Coulson and Mack helped a wounded May to get safety in a storage room. The room was soon assaulted by HYDRA agents who began to ram the door. Simmons took care of May's wound while Fitz and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) spread chlorine gas in the corridor, making the HYDRA agents cough and blinding them. The group was then rescued by the [Secret Warriors](/wiki/Secret_Warriors) and returned to the Zephyr One. ] Back at the [Playground](/wiki/Playground), [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) told Simmons that the dead body of [Lucio](/wiki/Lucio), killed by [Joey Gutierrez](/wiki/Joey_Gutierrez) during the battle at [Gideon Malick](/wiki/Gideon_Malick)'s Headquarters, maintained a high body temperature. Simmons was fascinated by this, but Fitz suggested they place the corpse in quarantine. They were then alerted by [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) the possibility of one of the [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans) being infected by [Hive](/wiki/Hive), so Simmons performed an autopsy on Lucio's corpse. She discussed with Fitz of the fact that they could not trust the Inhumans present at the Playground as they were all dangerous. Simmons then discovered the signs of Hive's infection in Lucio's brain and reported their discovery to Coulson. As they headed to Coulson's office, the power was cut at the Playground. Simmons and Fitz made their way to the generators room, but on their way, Simmons discovered the room where Malick was being held was open. When they went inside, they found Malick's dead body with a grenade beside it. The grenade exploded, throwing Simmons and Fitz across the room, knocking them out. They were found by Coulson who ordered them to get some rest in a calm place. Once the [Secret Warriors](/wiki/Secret_Warriors) became suspects for Malick's death, due to being swayed by Hive, Simmons, Fitz and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) searched through their lockers to find anything that would incriminate them. Mack found the [Kree Orb](/wiki/Kree_Orb) in [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell)'s bag, making them believe he was the swayed one. When they discovered it was Campbell who was infected, Simmons then ran some tests on the other Inhumans to see if they were possibly infected. Simmons and Fitz went to the latter's bedroom where they kept searching for a test for Hive's infection. Simmons suggested to investigate the Inhumans dopamine levels, thinking that Hive's infection could have the same effects than a drug addiction. Both sitting on Fitz's couch, they contemplated one of his pictures of cosmos, discussing Hive, and Simmons lamented over the fact that their friends needed their help. Simmons and Fitz then shared a tender look, holding hands before slowly kissing. Fitz apologized, remembering that Simmons had proposed to start their relationship from the beginning. However, Simmons replied that they had known each other for ten years and that, since Fitz considered that they were \"cursed\", they couldn't waste any more time. They kissed again and stayed in Fitz's bedroom until [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson), who turned out to be infected by Hive, escaped from containment by generating a earthquake which damaged the Playground. [[65]](#cite_note-AoS317-65) Bucharest Mission[ ] Simmons attended the crisis meeting held by [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) before leaving the [Playground](/wiki/Playground) with the [Zephyr and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) then informed Coulson that [Hive](/wiki/Hive)'s infection on the [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans) had the same effect as a drug addiction, making them invulnerable to [I.C.E.R.](/wiki/I.C.E.R.) shots. They suggested to make contact with Professor [Holden Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe), a scientist specialized in parasitic organisms who used to work at [GT Agrochemical](/wiki/GT_Agrochemical). Coulson sent Fitz, Simmons and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) to [Romania](/wiki/Romania) in order to retrieve Radcliffe. While preparing for the mission, Fitz and Simmons, acting as if they were having a professional conversation, due to the presence of numerous [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) agents around them, discussed the future of their relationship after the kiss they shared the day before, especially in the perspective of having sex. However, they were interrupted by [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May), who gave Simmons a gun, insisting that she should use it, should she feel that it was necessary. In [Bucharest](/wiki/Bucharest), Simmons, Fitz and Mackenzie rented a hotel room and prepared for their mission in a private club where Radcliffe was supposed to be. Simmons and Fitz posed as two high ranking geneticists willing to sell advanced technology to Radcliffe: a variation of the eye technology implanted in [Deathlok](/wiki/Deathlok). Mackenzie stayed in the hotel room, following the progression of his colleagues through Fitz's glasses. Fitz noticed two men staring at them and supposed that they were working for Radcliffe. Approaching them, they were greeted by [Anon](/wiki/Anon), Radcliffe's assistant, who asked them if they had made an appointment. Upon learning that they were willing to show their technology to Radcliffe only, Anon requested that Simmons and Fitz waited at the bar until Radcliffe was ready to see them. There, they briefly cut their communications so that Mackenzie could not hear them and they resumed their interrupted conversation about moving further in their relationship. Fitz compared the fact of having sex with Simmons to a singularity, like in transhumanism or in a black hole. Simmons found the metaphor both lovely and terrifying, and the two agreed that their best option was to stop thinking about it and simply do it. Anon came back to them and invited them to follow her in order to meet Radcliffe. Simmons and Fitz were brought to a small operation room where they were asked to surgically implant the cybernetic eye on a patient in order to demonstrate the efficiency of their technology. They discussed the matter with Mack and resolved to follow Anon's instructions. However, before doing the surgery, Simmons noticed that the eye they were supposed to replace was not of human origin but was instead an avian prosthetic eye. The patient they were supposed to operate was actually Radcliffe himself. Fitz and Simmons presented their technology to Radcliffe, who recognized it as similar to the one used by [Cybertek](/wiki/Cybertek) to control their soldiers through explosives implanted in the eye. Fearing that Fitz and Simmons were from [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA), Radcliffe ordered Anon to generate an EMP to disable their communications. Distraught, Fitz and Simmons informed Radcliffe of Hive's existence and his ability to infect Inhumans. However, before they could develop, Radcliffe's guards came across the room and one of them took Simmons out. However, once out of the elevator, the guard was killed by Hive, who had accompanied Johnson and [Alisha Whitley](/wiki/Alisha_Whitley) in order to kidnap Radcliffe. Hive used the memories of [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels) to overpower Simmons, reminding her of escape from [Maveth](/wiki/Maveth), during which Daniels protected Simmons from Hive at the cost of his own life. Hive invited Simmons to move on and to forget about her relationship with Daniels. However, Hive was unaware that Simmons had already moved on and begun a new relationship with Fitz. Thus, Simmons was more disgusted than distraught at the sight of a lethal enemy using the memories of her former lover and the body of [a despicable former colleague](/wiki/Grant_Ward), and therefore did not hesitate to shoot Hive three times in the stomach with the gun that May had given her, allowing her to flee. Simmons went back to the hotel room, where she found Mackenzie and informed him of Radcliffe's kidnapping by Hive and Johnson. Mackenzie and Simmons then discussed how she ran into Hive and shot him, and that they weren't able to get Johnson back. Mackenzie then stated that it always seemed that the world was against them, which lead them to talk about her and Fitz, since Mackenzie had perfectly understood why Simmons and Fitz had interrupted their communications earlier in the evening. Simmons told Mackenzie that her relationship with Fitz was still very new, but Mack disagreed, implying that she had been with Fitz for a very long time, even if they had their first kiss recently. His reaction made Simmons smile, as she knew he was right. Mackenzie, deciding to give the two some privacy, then left the room, while Simmons stayed waiting for Fitz. When Fitz finally returned, she asked about his whereabouts, making her concerned, which he told her that he was trying to find her, also being concerned. Simmons told him that Mackenzie was busy at the [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) unloading equipment, so they were alone in the hotel room for a while. Fitz, putting in practice what he and Simmons had discussed earlier in the club, kissed Simmons and the two finally had sex, taking a great leap forward in their relationship. [[66]](#cite_note-AoS318-66) Anti-Brainwashing Vaccine[ ] - \"The risks aren't as high as what you're saying.\" \"Don't pretend that's really your medical opinion.\" \"I'm not pretending... You're being overly cautious.\" \"Yeah, and you're being a lovesick fool trying to make a grand gesture.\" - [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Failed_Experiments) Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) kept trying to elaborate a cure for [Hive](/wiki/Hive)'s infection. They developed an antitoxin which was shown to fight the parasites, but it was also potentially fatal to the immune system. When [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell), who was willing to do anything in order to help bring back his girlfriend, [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson), offered to be tested with the antitoxin, Simmons deemed it too dangerous. They had to call for [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) in order to make a decision one way or the other. To Simmons, Campbell was only willing to try the antitoxin because he was a \"lovesick fool trying to make a grand gesture\". Fitz, possibly recognizing himself in this description since he had risked his life on multiple occasions to save Simmons, thought that there was a slight chance that it could work whereas Simmons insisted that it was way too dangerous for Campbell's life. Therefore, Coulson refused that Campbell received the antitoxin and ordered Fitz and Simmons to look for another solution. Simmons later discussed with Fitz at the [Playground](/wiki/Playground)'s cafeteria. Fitz was worried that their disagreement might affect their relationship in private. Simmons reassured him, saying that she did not want a boyfriend who agreed to anything she could say, referring to an old [boyfriend](/wiki/Milton). Both agreed that they should not let their disagreements at work endanger their newfound romantic relationship. The pair jokingly talked about their time at the [S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D._Academy_of_Science_and_Technology) on their way back to the lab. Suddenly, they discovered Campbell who had seized a syringe and injected himself with the antitoxin. Fitz and Simmons rushed at him but Campbell, on the verge of his body shutting down, refused Simmons to gave him a drug to counter the effects of the antitoxin. Simmons waited for Campbell to regain consciousness before performing a brain biopsy to test the effects of the antitoxin. Fitz and Simmons soon had another patient to take care of: Mackenzie, who had been wounded by Johnson in an attempt to bring her back to [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.). Coulson's team thus learned of Hive's plans: turning all humans into [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans) who would serve him while he took over the world. Later on, Simmons visited Campbell in his containment chamber and informed him that their attempt to rescue Johnson had failed. Campbell became angry in not being able to leave and save Johnson, but Simmons assured him that he was in no state to do anything. She also told him that the antitoxin she and Fitz had developed did not have the expected effects, and so they were still with no way of curing Hive's infection. [[13]](#cite_note-AoS319-13) Daisy Johnson's Return[ ] As [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) continued to try and keep [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) out of their servers, Simmons kept him company, watching [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell) in his room, discussing how he destroyed their research on the cure. Fitz exclaimed that his job would be easier with [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie), and Simmons voiced her concerns about Mackenzie after the failure of his mission for rescuing Johnson. They were interrupted by [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) who tasked Simmons to help them understanding [Hive](/wiki/Hive)'s ways of thinking as she had spent time with two of his hosts, namely [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels) and [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward). Simmons later Fitz, [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and [Glenn Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot) where she explained to the General the mechanism of Hive's infection. She also informed Coulson and Talbot that although [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) managed to prevent Hive from harvesting [Kree](/wiki/Kree) blood in order to replicate the experiment that had turned him into an [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans), he could use Johnson's blood instead since it had been exposed to [GH.325](/wiki/GH.325), of Kree origin. Simmons and Fitz warned Coulson and Talbot that Hive could create a virus in order to infect mankind. The meeting was interrupted when Simmons and Fitz figured out that Johnson had replaced the video feed of Campbell's [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module) by a prerecorded loop in order to orchestrate his escape. Simmons and Mackenzie assisted Fitz in the servers room in order to protect it from Johnson, but they forgot to do the same for the [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet)'s remote control systems, and one plane managed to leave the [Playground](/wiki/Playground). However, it soon turned out that this was a trick designed by Coulson, May and Campbell in order to gain Johnson's trust and send [Lash](/wiki/Lash) to Hive's base in order to rescue Johnson and kill Hive. Though Lash was unsuccessful in killing Hive, and was killed by [Hellfire](/wiki/Hellfire), he Johnson returned to S.H.I.E.L.D., where Simmons had her checked on at the med bay. Simmons ran her tests on Johnson, where she confirmed that she was no longer infected. However, Simmons and Fitz then learnt from Johnson and informed Coulson of Hive's plans to infect a wide majority of the population, turning them into the [Primitives](/wiki/Primitives) Johnson had told them about. Simmons stated that Hive would only be able to do this if he was able to obtain a high enough velocity. However, General Talbot revealed to S.H.I.E.L.D. that Hive had stolen a war head from an [ATCU](/wiki/ATCU) facility that he could use to spread his virus. [[67]](#cite_note-AoS320-67) Following her return to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground), Johnson was brought to a [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module) where Simmons visited her in order to get some information about Hive and his plans and informed Johnson that a S.H.I.E.L.D. mission was en route to stop Hive. The mission was a success and Hive was brought back into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. However, the warhead that Hive had stolen still represented a threat. When [Holden Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe) was brought to the Playground, Simmons and Fitz greeted him, having encountered him previously before his capture. They then began to work together to counter the effect of Hive's formula. [[68]](#cite_note-AoS321-68) [Battle of the Playground](/wiki/Battle_of_the_Playground)[ ] Following [Hive](/wiki/Hive)'s capture, Simmons planned to get some rest from [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) and prepared a romantic getaway with [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) to the [Seychelles](/wiki/Seychelles). However, these holiday plans were postponed when Hive managed to escape from the Gel Matrix Box in which he was locked in an turned several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents into [Primitives](/wiki/Primitives) who stormed the [Playground](/wiki/Playground). Simmons worried about her boyfriend who was precisely near them when Hive was set free, but she managed to help him escaping the cargo bay. [[68]](#cite_note-AoS321-68) Fearing that Hive and his Primitives could reach valuable information and equipment in the Playground, [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) ordered Simmons to secure as much as she could in the lab. However, she was quickly overwhelmed by Primitives and hid in a boiler room when the power was cut. Simmons figured out that the Primitives' vision was in infrared more than in visible light. Therefore, she increased the temperature of the Playground using the old furnaces, so that she and her friends would be invisible to the Primitives. This enabled her to join the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and inform them that Fitz and [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) had infiltrated the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) stolen by Hive. Stopping Hive[ ] - \" [Hive](/wiki/Hive)and his down here any second.\" \"And then?\" \"Even if we could steal the warhead, it's probably on a timer by now.\" - [Phil catch up with the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) in order to put an end to [Hive](/wiki/Hive)'s plans. However, Campbell was severely injured by [Hellfire](/wiki/Hellfire) and Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) had to take care of his wounds. Simmons and Fitz then let [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) be with Campbell to give them some privacy. Coulson disclosed his plan to the rest of his team: stealing the warhead containing Hive's pathogen and load it into a Quinjet to have it blown into space, where the pathogen would be harmless. However, this implied that someone had to be in the Quinjet, sacrificing themselves. When they discovered that Johnson ran to the Quinjet to do it, Hive and several [Primitives](/wiki/Primitives) appeared, causing them to fight them off. Simmons, along with the rest of the team were able to defeat the Primitives, but Hive got away, going after Johnson. To everyone's surprise, Campbell had also infiltrated the Quinjet and projected Johnson out of it, taking the Quinjet into the cosmos himself with Hive and the warhead aboard. Johnson begged her friends to bring Campbell back, but Campbell had suppressed the remote control, and the Quinjet could not be maneuvered in space anyway. Simmons then watched, helpless, the destruction of the Quinjet, exchanging a saddened look with Fitz at the sight of Johnson, devastated by the loss of her boyfriend.

While Simmons and Fitz were fixing the last details of Rodriguez's registration, Rodriguez was secretly doing a facial recognition on a lab's computer in order to locate [Victor Ramon](/wiki/Victor_Ramon). Thus, she played for time by messing with some lab equipment and asking Simmons and Fitz if they were considering living together outside the Playground. Simmons smiled at the idea, glad to have an occasion to address the matter with her boyfriend again. [[70]](#cite_note-AoSS103-70) A New Position[ ] - \"As soon as [Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot)gave the locations of [this base](/wiki/Playground)to the [President](/wiki/Matthew_Ellis), things changed.

She continued to spend some time in the S.H.I.E.L.D. labs, for instance helping Fitz designing the [Framework](/wiki/Framework), a virtual working environment. Simmons also discussed the new S.H.I.E.L.D. with [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie). Later, Fitz and Simmons lamented over the fact that they have little time to see each other outside of work and that they were some people, like the rogue agent [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson), they would probably never see again. Simmons' position triggered some awkwardness between her and the former members of [Coulson's Team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team). In particular, [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May), who was uncomfortable with the professional proximity between Simmons and Director Mace. Simmons and May argued about the fact that May had given Coulson and Mackenzie intel about [Quake](/wiki/Quake)'s whereabouts though they were ordered not to search for her. Simmons informed May that she had to report this to the Director in order to keep his trust, and sent her with her [team](/wiki/May%27s_Team) to get Coulson and Mackenzie back. [[71]](#cite_note-AoS401-71) Dealing with Ghosts[ ] - \"Maybe [she](/wiki/Lucy_Bauer)'s Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Meet_the_New_Boss) Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) were asked to study a [mysterious box](/wiki/Quantum_Batteries) brought back from a field mission by [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May). [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) then came to the lab and told them that [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) had heard about someone suffering from the same kind of dementia than the [Chinese mobsters](/wiki/Chinatown_Crew) who had been in contact with the box. When Mackenzie mentioned the vision of a ghost, Simmons deemed it as simple hallucinations, but then Mackenzie showed them footage of [Lucy Bauer](/wiki/Lucy_Bauer), who looked like a spectrum. Simmons and Fitz investigated Bauer's incorporeal nature, mentioning a possible multi-dimensional event like [Tobias Ford](/wiki/Tobias_Ford) had experienced. Mackenzie decided to go on the field to investigate a facility of [Momentum Labs](/wiki/Momentum_Labs) with Fitz while Simmons remained at the [Playground](/wiki/Playground) to help give a tour for congressmen visiting the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. However, right before it, she had to deal with a panic attack from [Chen](/wiki/Chen), a Chinese mobster locked in a [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module), who saw demonic faces on everyone, causing her to put him to sleep for an hour. Simmons then returned to the lab where she was surprised by the tour group's presence, forgetting that she was meant to met up with them. As Mace described her work to the tour, Simmons noticed Chen being taken away on a monitor, causing her to signal to Coulson to look at it. When Mace suggested to check out the containment module, Simmons informed him of the incident, and he guided the group elsewhere. Coulson then asked her if she knew what set Chen off, which Simmons asked if he had checked with May, suspecting that she was experiencing the same troubles. [[72]](#cite_note-AoS402-72) Melinda May's Near-Death Experience[ ] - \"You're ready?\" ready! We're about to [May](/wiki/Melinda_May)!\" \"We're about to save - [Holden Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Uprising_(episode)) While [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) was being treated in a [CDC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention) facility, Simmons tried to alert the medical teams that were there about her health and to get information on her disease, but to no avail. [Chen](/wiki/Chen), who was suffering the same disease, had another crisis and died immediately after, leaving only May with a few hours to live. [Jeffrey Mace](/wiki/Jeffrey_Mace) authorized Simmons to take May to [Holden Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe) in order to cure her. Radcliffe used the [Framework](/wiki/Framework) equipment to get a precise image of May's brain. Simmons and Radcliffe figured out what part of May's brain was activated to the extreme, causing a high fight-or-flight response which could scare her to death. Therefore, Radcliffe and Simmons had to find a way to stop May's terror. Radcliffe came up with a theory: shutting May's brain down and rebooting it, just like a computer, hoping to resetting all the brain functions. Though Simmons thought that was crazy, she accepted due to their lack of other options. Unfortunately, while Simmons was on the verge of rebooting May's brain, a blackout caused by the [Watchdogs](/wiki/Watchdogs) occurred, shutting power down and forcing Simmons to perform CPR until power was back. With May facing certain death, Radcliffe seized [Aida](/wiki/Aida)'s power source and use it to power the medical equipment. To Simmons' relieve, May was successfully brought back. Simmons, Radcliffe and May later watched Director Mace's press conference revealing [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) to the public.

Indeed, Quake was badly injured and could not trust anyone but Simmons to help her. Moreover, Quake needed Simmons in order to gain access to [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) files regarding [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans) in order to protect them against the [Watchdogs](/wiki/Watchdogs). Simmons reluctantly accepted to help Quake and used her high-ranking position to do so. Simmons and Quake figured out that the Watchdogs were directly tapping into S.H.I.E.L.D. files. Understanding that more Inhumans were in danger, Simmons and Quake went to see [Hellfire](/wiki/Hellfire), who worked in a firework store and could be threatened by the Watchdogs. However, it soon turned out that Hellfire sided with the Watchdogs and dragged Simmons and Quake into an ambush. Quake used her powers to escape with Simmons and the two friends hid in a storage box. Hellfire found them and was ready to kill them, but fortunately they were saved by [Ghost Rider](/wiki/Ghost_Rider), who had come to the firework store with [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie). Together, they escaped right before Hellfire and Ghost Rider had the store exploding. Returning to safety, Simmons went with Coulson to the [Radcliffe Residence](/wiki/Radcliffe_Residence) to pick up [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May). There, she discovered the existence of [Aida](/wiki/Aida), Radcliffe's assistant, who Simmons quickly figured out that she was an [android](/wiki/Life-Model_Decoy). Simmons confronted [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), commenting on the impressiveness of her, which Fitz thought she was commenting on her looks, until Simmons revealed that she knew she was an android. Fitz then admitted Aida's true nature and told Simmons that he could not share the information with her since Radcliffe was not supposed to work without S.H.I.E.L.D. supervision and Simmons had regular lie detection tests. Simmons, distraught, informed Fitz that she had a test the next day. He then asked her to keep this a secret, which was not going to be the first. [[74]](#cite_note-AoS404-74) Blackmailing Director Mace[ ] After learning [Aida](/wiki/Aida)'s true nature, Simmons was mad at [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) for keeping a secret. Fitz tried to reconcile with Simmons, offering to train her for her [lie detection test](/wiki/Lie_Detector), but Simmons bluntly refused and sent Fitz away. Simmons worried about the fact of being fired or arrested for not reporting the existence of Aida. When asked if she had not disclosed sensitive information, Simmons took some time to answer and Director [Jeffrey Mace](/wiki/Jeffrey_Mace) arrive in the room, ordering Simmons to follow him. Fortunately for Simmons, it turned out that Mace had interrupted the lie detection test because he needed her help for a debate with anti- [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans) Senator [Ellen Nadeer](/wiki/Ellen_Nadeer). Simmons provided Mace with facts and figures while he was live, but at some point, the Director removed his earphone and chose to publicly reveal that he was an Inhuman himself. However, when Mace related the [attack of Vienna](/wiki/Bombing_of_the_Vienna_International_Centre) and how he saved a woman, Simmons noticed a microexpression indicating that he was actually lying. When Mace confronted Simmons about how uncomfortable she had seemed during her lie detection test, Simmons informed him that she knew the truth about Vienna, forcing Mace to exempt her from further lie detection tests.

Much to her surprise, she had to wear a black hood so that she would not s know where she was taken. [[76]](#cite_note-AoS406-76) Simmons arrived in a mysterious place where her hood was taken off. After putting on a hazmat suit, she was asked to study a [Terrigenesis](/wiki/Terrigenesis) cocoon that had been formed seven months ago, whereas the classical process is instantaneous. Simmons, stunned, asked about the [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans)'s identity, but was told that it was classified. After checking on the subject's heart rate, Simmons ordered all the men present to leave so she could help him relax. The Terrigenesis began to conclude, and Simmons started to talk to the man, who turned out to be [Vijay Nadeer](/wiki/Vijay_Nadeer), the brother of the anti-Inhumans Senator [Ellen Nadeer](/wiki/Ellen_Nadeer) (though Simmons was unaware of that at the time). However, before she could further discuss with the man, she was forcefully taken out of the place, wearing the hood again. Simmons was brought back to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground) where she reunited with her boyfriend [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), who had just barely escaped [Hell](/wiki/Dark_Dimension). The two, considerably relieved to find each other, hugged, finally having a tender moment after their argument about [Aida](/wiki/Aida)'s conception. [[77]](#cite_note-AoS407-77) [Battle at the Chinatown Crew Headquarters](/wiki/Battle_at_the_Chinatown_Crew_Headquarters)[ ] Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) assisted the rest of the team from the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) when an assault was launched against the [Chinatown Crew Headquarters](/wiki/Chinatown_Crew_Headquarters) in order to stop [Eli Morrow](/wiki/Eli_Morrow). They also monitored the numerous earthquakes that were happening across the globe. When [Ghost Rider](/wiki/Ghost_Rider) infiltrated the building, Simmons discovered that Morrow had built a giant [Quantum Battery](/wiki/Quantum_Batteries). Morrow placed a [Demon Core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_Core) (a subcritical mass of plutonium) inside the Battery, making him able to cause a massive nuclear explosion. While talking with Quake, Simmons and Fitz found out that Morrow was at the epicenter of a new earthquake that [Quake](/wiki/Quake) was feeling. Fitz then explained that Morrow was not creating matter out of nothing, but rather was harvesting energy from another dimension, which caused all the earthquakes. Simmons, Fitz, [Holden Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe) and [Aida](/wiki/Aida) went under the Chinatown Crew Headquarters, building a new [Inter-Dimensional Gate](/wiki/Inter-Dimensional_Gate) in order to end Morrow's plans while Quake absorbed the seismic waves. They were discovered by one of Morrow's mobsters, who shot Aida before being killed by Fitz and Simmons. Despite this interruption, [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)'s plan succeeded and Morrow was sent to another dimension along with Ghost Rider and the Quantum Battery. Simmons and the rest of the team returned to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground), where they watched the T.V. news about the S.H.I.E.L.D. operation in [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles). [[78]](#cite_note-AoS408-78) and LMDs[ Vijay seen what [you](/wiki/Vijay_Nadeer)are. That's here: [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)wants to make you their weapon.\" \"Nothing could be further from the truth.\" - [Ellen Nadeer](/wiki/Ellen_Nadeer)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Broken_Promises) By doing some research, Simmons figured out that the [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans) she had helped with his [Terrigenesis](/wiki/Terrigenesis) was no other than [Vijay Nadeer](/wiki/Vijay_Nadeer), the brother of the anti-Inhumans Senator [Ellen Nadeer](/wiki/Ellen_Nadeer). Simmons suspected that Vijay Nadeer was being kept hidden by his sister. Upon learning this information, Director [Jeffrey Mace](/wiki/Jeffrey_Mace) decided to set up a field mission with Simmons and [Quake](/wiki/Quake) to rescue him. Simmons went to the [Capitol](/wiki/United_States_Capitol) in order to infiltrate Senator Nadeer's office, where she was assaulted by Nadeer's assistant. She went back to Quake and Mace and the three of them went to Ellen Nadeer's residence. After a tense confrontation, the [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) agents agreed to leave, but immediately returned upon hearing a gunshot while [Tucker Shockley](/wiki/Tucker_Shockley) was fighting Vijay Nadeer. Simmons tried to convince Vijay to come with them, but he decided otherwise and chose to stay with his sister. Disappointed, Simmons returned to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground). [[2]](#cite_note-AoS409-2) Director's Secret[ ] - \"The decision was made that the new Director had to be enhanced. No candidate fit that criteria. So we made one.\" \"You restarted the [Erskine](/wiki/Abraham_Erskine) [program](/wiki/Project_Rebirth).\" \"There's no program. Just took a very [well-vetted candidate](/wiki/Jeffrey_Mace)and turned him into the hero and leader that we needed.\" - [Glenn Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/The_Patriot) Simmons discovered that [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) had kept [Aida](/wiki/Aida)'s head after her rebellion and ordered it destroyed. Soon after, she learned about the attempted assassination on [Jeffrey Mace](/wiki/Jeffrey_Mace) and was ordered by [Glenn Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot) to see whether [Burrows](/wiki/Burrows) was aboard the [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) with the Director. When they learned about the Quinjet's crash, Simmons offered to look into Mace's files to find a lead about the Director's enemies and was tasked with finding a way to make contact with Mace, [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie), all of them missing. Simmons updated Fitz when he returned to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground). They further discussed Aida's rebellion and Simmons asked her boyfriend to stop investigating on the matter, wanting Aida's head to be destroyed. Simmons and Fitz were unable to locate the Quinjet but they soon learned a disturbing truth from Talbot: contrary to what had been announced, Mace was not an [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans). Instead, he was using a super strength serum inspired from [Calvin Zabo's Formula](/wiki/Calvin_Zabo%27s_Formula). Simmons and Fitz strongly disagreed with this decision, stating that despite the precautions taken, the super-serum could be dangerous for Mace's health. Since they could not locate the Quinjet used by Mace, Simmons and Fitz suggested to use Aida's severed head in order to intimidate [Yuri Zaikin](/wiki/Yuri_Zaikin), the [Watchdog](/wiki/Watchdogs) who had tried to kill Mace, to find their missing colleagues. Simmons entered the room an began to threaten Zaikin with torture that she would put onto him, while only being an act. She then showed him Aida's head, which caused him to comply, being incredibly terrified. Having the idea prove to be successful and Simmons managed to get the answers they needed. Later, Simmons saw Fitz locking away Aida's head for good, ignorant of the fact that he had downloaded its data on his phone. [[79]](#cite_note-AoS410-79) Holden Radcliffe's Betrayal[ ] - \"You know, one of the upsides of having a girlfriend is you get to talk about what's bothering you.\" \"Yeah, well, doesn't really sound like an upside for the girlfriend.\" \"I know you're upset about [Aida](/wiki/Aida). I'm in a strange position. I don't want to intrude on you while you're... processing..\" - Jemma Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) [[src]](/wiki/Wake_Up_(episode)) Simmons was worried to let [Quake](/wiki/Quake) go to the [United States Capitol](/wiki/United_States_Capitol) to sign the [Sokovia Accords](/wiki/Sokovia_Accords). The mission was authorized nonetheless since it would enable [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) to gain access to [Ellen Nadeer](/wiki/Ellen_Nadeer)'s office. In the meantime, Simmons talked with [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), who was still troubled by what happened with [Aida](/wiki/Aida), and told him that she was there in case he needed support. Simmons took part in the mission along with [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May/Life-Model_Decoy) (though she was unaware that [her friend](/wiki/Melinda_May) had been replaced by a [Life-Model Decoy](/wiki/Life-Model_Decoy)), the two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents monitoring the Capitol while [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) planted spying equipment in the Senator's office. However, their mission was discovered and Coulson and Rodriguez were briefly arrested. Simmons and May figured out that the Senator had intel from inside S.H.I.E.L.D. Simmons understood that Fitz had been working on Aida's head all along instead of locking it away for good. Simmons accused Fitz of being the source of Nadeer's intel since he could have turned on Aida's eye camera and thus leaked intel from within S.H.I.E.L.D. However, Fitz rejected Simmons' accusations and corrected her when she told him he was obsessed with Aida. Instead, Fitz told her that he had been investigating on the cause of Aida's malfunction and that he had found the answer: [Holden Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe), Aida's creator. Following this revelation, Simmons joined a team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents led by Coulson to the [Radcliffe Residence](/wiki/Radcliffe_Residence) in order to [arrest](/wiki/Arrest_of_Holden_Radcliffe) Radcliffe. Although, unknown to everyone present, it wasn't the real Radcliffe, but a [Life-Model Decoy](/wiki/Life-Model_Decoy) of him, as he anticipated himself being caught by S.H.I.E.L.D.. [[80]](#cite_note-AoS411-80) Interrogating Holden Radcliffe's LMD[ ] It turned out that [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) had not arrested the real [Holden Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe) but his [Life-Model Decoy](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe/Life-Model_Decoy). Still, Simmons attended his interrogation with [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) in order to find out where the real Radcliffe was and what his plans were. However, the questioning did not go well when they discovered that they were unable to hack into the LMD's systems. When the android began to provoke Fitz, mentioning his [father](/wiki/Alistair_Fitz), causing him to become angry. Despite Simmons' encouragement, Fitz left the room, after learning that Radcliffe knew his father. Simmons found her boyfriend in their bedroom, lamenting over the fact that he had been betrayed on multiple occasions, be it by his father, [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward) or now Radcliffe. However, Simmons made him see the bright side by reminding him that these betrayals had not kept him from becoming a good and caring person. When Fitz noticed that this could be the reason why he kept being betrayed, Simmons replied that it was the reason she fell in love with him. Finally, when Simmons told Fitz that his personality was something more than pure programming, it clicked in Fitz's mind: if he could not crack Radcliffe's LMD's code, it was because the android was not running on pure programming as well. Instead, he was using a [Quantum Brain](/wiki/Quantum_Brain) built by [Aida](/wiki/Aida) thanks to the knowledge of the [Darkhold](/wiki/Darkhold). While Simmons and Fitz examined his Quantum Brain, Radcliffe's LMD inadvertently revealed that Radcliffe and Aida had crafted more than one Quantum Brain: the [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May/Life-Model_Decoy) that had been with them in the last few days was also a LMD. Simmons and Fitz thus informed [Quake](/wiki/Quake), who was on the field with Melinda May's LMD, who was closer than ever to retrieve the Darkhold. Finally, considering that they had obtained all the answers that they could get, Simmons, Fitz, [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie), Quake and [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) proceeded to the destruction of Aida's severed head and Radcliffe's LMD in a furnace. [[81]](#cite_note-AoS412-81) Fighting Tucker Shockley[ ] - \"I know [General Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot)was hoping to replicate [what](/wiki/Project_Rebirth)was done to [Steve Rogers](/wiki/Steve_Rogers), but... but you'll never be Captain America.\" - Jemma Simmons to [Jeffrey Mace](/wiki/Jeffrey_Mace) [[src]](/wiki/BOOM) Following the [Glenn Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot)'s revelation about the use of a super-serum by [Jeffrey Mace](/wiki/Jeffrey_Mace), Simmons ran a number of medical tests and concluded that Mace should not use this serum since it was potentially lethal. Along with other [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) agents at the [Playground](/wiki/Playground), Simmons learned about the attack on [Ellen Nadeer](/wiki/Ellen_Nadeer)'s office and the death of the Senator. Simmons joined a team and headed to the [Capitol](/wiki/United_States_Capitol) in order to investigate the office's remnants. Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) took numerous samples but could not find any trace of explosives in the office. When they learned about the fact that [Tucker Shockley](/wiki/Tucker_Shockley) had visited the Senator prior to the attack, they suspected him to be the bomber. Shockley was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. and taken onto the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One). In the meantime, Simmons and Fitz continued their lab tests. They finally figured out that the explosion was due to an [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans) who had undergone [Terrigenesis](/wiki/Terrigenesis) in the office: Shockley himself. Simmons and Fitz rushed at him while he was on the verge of blowing the plane. With the help of Director Mace, Fitz locked Shockley in the plane's [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module) while Simmons ejected it out of the plane. She chastised Fitz for risking his life but quickly hugged him, relieved that he was unharmed. Since Shockley could survive his explosions, Simmons and Fitz worked on a way to control and contain him, asking [Quake](/wiki/Quake) to practice in order to generate counter-vibrations to defuse Shockley's explosions. However, her attempts were quite unsuccessful. S.H.I.E.L.D. decided to go on the field nonetheless and they managed to capture Shockley and contain him in a secure pod. However, Director Mace was captured by the [Watchdogs](/wiki/Watchdogs) to ensure Simmons', Fitz's and Quake's because [someone](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe)uses [your ideas](/wiki/Framework)for evil does not make it your fault for creating it in the first place. You make things from the genius of your mind and the goodness of your heart to help people. Don't let Radcliffe's actions corrupt that. You are not responsible for the twisted things he's done. Wrongs have been committed. Now we make them right - together.\" - Jemma Simmons to [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) [[src]](/wiki/The_Man_Behind_the_Shield) Since [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) was [Aida](/wiki/Aida) and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) what the alternate reality was and how it worked using their own version of it, underlining that Radcliffe had likely built a very powerful version of the Framework. Later, Simmons witnessed an argument between Fitz and Mackenzie about the consequences of Fitz's designs. Simmons and Fitz quickly found that it was nearly impossible for [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) to track down the location of Radcliffe's equipment. Nevertheless, Quake managed to find the location of [Krasnoyarsk Krai](/wiki/Krasnoyarsk_Krai), where [Anton Ivanov](/wiki/Anton_Ivanov)'s men were based. Simmons informed Fitz and comforted him when he voiced his concerns about the consequences of his designs, reminding him that he never had bad intentions and that he had a chance to make amends for his mistakes by rescuing his friends. Simmons, Fitz, Coulson, Mackenzie and Quake infiltrated Krasnoyarsk Krai's naval base, where Simmons and Fitz had to take over the communications room. Upon learning that Aida was also present, Simmons took agent [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) with her and went to find the android. However, Aida escaped in Ivanov's submarine. S.H.I.E.L.D. managed to free [Jeffrey Mace](/wiki/Patriot) and everybody went back to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground). However, unbeknownst to Simmons, Coulson, Mace, Mackenzie and Fitz had been kidnapped and replaced by [Life-Model Decoys](/wiki/Life-Model_Decoy). Back at the Playground, Simmons noticed that there was a strange time gap during which no one could communicate during their mission on the field. She then received an alarm on her computer, indicating that several LMDs had entered the Playground. Simmons mistakenly thought that Quake was one of them. She therefore believed that Quake, Coulson, Mackenzie and Mace were LMDs. [[83]](#cite_note-AoS414-83) Hunted by the LMDs[ ] - \"Cut your wrist. If you're the [LMD](/wiki/Life-Model_Decoy), I'll see your substructure and I'll know. And if not...\" \"Not, then you're the android, and you just convinced me to slit my wrist.\" \"Do it!\" - Jemma Simmons and [Leo Fitz LMD](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Life-Model_Decoy) [[src]](/wiki/Self_Control) Simmons, panicking, struggled to find a solution to avoid being assaulted by the [LMDs](/wiki/Life-Model_Decoy). [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Life-Model_Decoy) advised her to act like everything was normal and shortly after, she learned about the LMDs' plan to bring all the [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans) to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground). Simmons remained with Fitz's LMD until they received another alarm: a picture of Simmons and Fitz indicating that one of them was also an LMD. Things quickly went south when Simmons understood that the Fitz, who had been with her since they had returned from [Krasnoyarsk Krai](/wiki/Krasnoyarsk_Krai), was an LMD. However, Fitz denied that and said that Simmons was an LMD instead. Refusing to believe him, Simmons asked him to cut his wrist to prove he was not an android. Fitz obeyed but then tricked Simmons and managed to knock her out, revealing that he was indeed an android. Fitz's LMD proceeded to download Simmons' brain data in order to upload her consciousness in the [Framework](/wiki/Framework) and replace her by a Life-Model Decoy. Simmons managed to untie herself and grab a hammer, though she was lightly sedated and therefore too weak to defend herself. Nevertheless, she managed to play for time by getting Fitz's LMD discuss the idea of her marrying Fitz, an idea that her [real boyfriend](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) had never mentioned. Simmons then smashed a lever with her hammer, knocking the android down, and stabbed him on multiple occasions to destroy it. Afterwards, she fled and hid in a storage room. Simmons was found by [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson), who was the only one of the team not being replaced by a LMD. The two women argued, mutually accusing the other of being an android. Johnson suggested to use her powers to prove that she was a real person (since LMDs cannot display Inhuman abilities) and to check that Simmons was human as well by checking the vibrations of her bone structure. Simmons was too afraid to accept, but Johnson forcefully grabbed her hand and quaked her. Both considerably relieved, Simmons and Johnson fell in each other's arms upon realizing that they had at least one ally at the Playground. Still, the situation was critical for the two [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) agents. In particular, Simmons was highly distressed and could not easily think, but Johnson managed to devise a plan to take them out of the Playground. When Simmons told her that she thought Simmons wanted to sacrifice herself to atone for [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell)'s own sacrifice, Johnson replied that she was not intending to sacrifice herself but rather do anything so that Simmons and Fitz would be reunited. Simmons tearfully agreed. After spreading sleeping gas throughout the Playground, leaving only the LMDs awake, Simmons and Johnson left their hiding place. Simmons found agent [Piper](/wiki/Piper) and her teammates and ordered them to go to the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One). While they were about to leave the base, Simmons and Johnson were stopped by [Melinda May's LMD](/wiki/Melinda_May/Life-Model_Decoy). However, they persuaded her to let them go. Thanks to that, Simmons and Johnson managed to leave the Playground with Piper, [Prince](/wiki/Prince) and [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) before it was destroyed by an explosion. Aboard the Zephyr One, after picking up [Elena Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez), Simmons and Johnson decided to plug themselves to the [Framework](/wiki/Framework) in order to retrieve and save their friends. [[5]](#cite_note-AoS415-5) Framework[ ] Brave New Terrifying World[ ] Simmons entered in the [Framework](/wiki/Framework) by incarnating [an avatar of herself](/wiki/Jemma_Simmons/Framework) who was killed when [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA/Framework), while taking over the world in the Framework, led a fierce battle against [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D./Framework) at the [S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D._Academy). Simmons, while a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, was shot and buried in a pauper's grave. Therefore, in the Framework, Simmons was officially considered deceased. In shock when she realized she was buried and saw the presence of bullet holes on her clothes, Simmons quickly remembered the reason of her presence in the Framework and began looking for [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson), who entered the Framework with her. She made her way to the fences surrounding the former buildings of S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy and stopped a car, explaining to the driver, [Julia Price](/wiki/Julia_Price) that she needed help. Price accepted to offer her assistance and took Simmons with her. However, the car was stopped at a road checkpoint where drivers and passengers were expected to show some ID in order to make way. Simmons, distraught, told Price that she did not have any before realizing that she still had her Framework S.H.I.E.L.D. badge in her pocket. Upon seeing this, Price was terrified and asked Simmons to leave her car immediately. Simmons begged her to help her, but she was forced to keep going on foot. Indeed, since HYDRA had taken over the [United States](/wiki/United_States_of_America) in the Framework, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents were relentlessly hunted down and eliminated and no one could be found associating with one of them. Therefore, Simmons left the car and went by foot in order to find a way to avoid the checkpoint. Simmons entered a diner, knowing that she was in danger and with very little means of action. She managed to steal a car key and a coat to two customers in the diner, but was arrested by two policemen who had noticed the bullet holes in her clothes. They brought Simmons to their car and prepared to take her away. However, when one of them entered her name in the system, he found out that she was officially deceased. Simmons took advantage of their bewilderment to knock them out and stole their car. Using the policemen's computer, Simmons looked for information to know what role her teammates were playing in the Framework. Unable to access [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)'s files, she found the location of [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and drived to the school indicated by the computer. Indeed, in the Framework, Coulson was nothing but a simple teacher, spreading HYDRA's propaganda at school. Simmons went to see him after his class but, since he did not seem to recognize her, she felt forced to tell him the whole story about the fallacy of the Framework's world. Coulson disbelieved her and asked her to leave, which Simmons did but not before reminding him of the phrase \"It's a magical place\" [that had been artificially implanted in the real Coulson's mind](/wiki/Resurrection_of_Phil_Coulson). After she left, Coulson called HYDRA authorities and reported Simmons as a subversive. Simmons was finally reunited with Johnson at their meeting point. Johnson explained to Simmons that she was apparently working for HYDRA and in a relationship with [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward/Framework). Disgusted, Simmons told Johnson what she had learnt during her time in the Framework. They were later ambushed by Ward, who turned out to be a double agent whose true loyalty was to the [S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D./Framework). Ward helped Simmons and Johnson escape HYDRA and led them to [Skye](/wiki/Skye/Framework)'s apartment, where they discussed the fate of their friends. Realizing their mission was fundamentally different from what they were expecting, Johnson made the call to temporarily return to the real world in order to come up with a new plan. However, the device Simmons and Johnson designed as a backdoor did not work, indicating that they had been trapped by [Aida](/wiki/Aida).

Simmons and Johnson discussed the possibility of convincing [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), which Johnson told her was not the same as it was for Coulson. When they mentioned [Holden Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe), Coulson informed them of his existence, which they wondered why he would be in the Framework, leading to them believing he could help them get out. Simmons and Coulson then went to find [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward/Framework)'s contact in the [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D./Framework) resistance in order to go to safety. They were brought into the [Playground](/wiki/Playground), where they met the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D.: the [Patriot](/wiki/Patriot). They were later joined by Ward, who informed them that [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA/Framework) had taken Johnson in custody. Ward expressed doubts about Simmons' true purpose but Simmons managed to convince them of her loyalty by telling them about the fall of [S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D._Academy) in which she was allegedly killed. Ward gave her the location of [Holden Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe) found by Johnson: [Ogygia](/wiki/Ogygia). Therefore, Simmons, Ward and Coulson took a [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) and headed to the island. Simmons found Radcliffe and confronted him about what happened in the Framework, demanding his assistance in order to escape the alternate reality. Ward, who could not understand anything of what was being said, insisted for taking Radcliffe away and interrogate him at the Playground, but they were interrupted by the arrival of [Madame Hydra](/wiki/Aida) and [The Doctor](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) aboard the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One). In shock, Simmons saw her boyfriend siding with Aida and HYDRA. When The Doctor brought [Agnes Kitsworth](/wiki/Agnes_Kitsworth) and threatened to kill her, Ward aimed at him, ready to eliminate The Doctor. Simmons confessed that she somehow knew HYDRA's ruthless second-in-command and that she loved him, asking Ward not to kill him. Ward reluctantly agreed but shortly after, The Doctor shot Kitsworth, much to Simmons' horror, who started screaming, drawing HYDRA's agents' attention. Simmons, Ward and Coulson fortunately managed to leave Ogygia while being attacked by HYDRA. Back at the Playground, the Patriot confronted Simmons about keeping Ward from killing The Doctor. However, Simmons broke down and left the room, unable to bear more of the horror of the Framework. [[85]](#cite_note-AoS417-85) An Unbelievable Truth[ ] - \"I realize how it sounds.

When he returned, Simmons asked Coulson about Johnson, but he informed her of their failure. They then discussed escaping the [Framework](/wiki/Framework) and trying to convince the Patriot of the world's true nature. Suddenly, the Patriot and [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward/Framework) approached Simmons and summoned her in order to know if she was hiding something. Despite Coulson advising otherwise, Simmons explained everything about the [Framework](/wiki/Framework) and the fact that it was an alternate reality in which everybody was living a fake life. Mace and Ward did not believe her, saying that what they were doing in the [S.H.I.E.L.D](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D./Framework) resistance mattered, but they let her go nonetheless. Later, Simmons met [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie), who did not recognize her like everyone else, and his daughter [Hope](/wiki/Hope_Mackenzie/Framework). She talked with Mackenzie about HYDRA's reign of terror and how they changed history to their convenience. While she was watching him play with his daughter, Ward came to her and mentioned her story about being in a fake reality. He then apologized to her for the vile actions of his [real-world counterpart](/wiki/Grant_Ward). They were interrupted by a transmission indicating that the Patriot and Coulson, both on a field mission in the HYDRA Enlightenment Cultivation Center, were in danger. Ward decided to go the HYDRA facility to rescue his colleagues and Simmons chose to go with him in Mackenzie's place since she could not risk her friend's life. Simmons and Ward managed to infiltrate the compound and watched the destruction of the quarantine building. Once inside, she witnessed, powerless, the death of the Patriot while he was helping children to escape, meaning that he was also dead in the real world. Simmons escaped with the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and returned to the Playground. [[86]](#cite_note-AoS418-86) Project Looking Glass[ ] - \" [She](/wiki/Aida)wants to make herself into a real person.\" \"A real girl, as opposed to?\" \"A simulated consciousness. She wants to circumvent her programming.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Antoine Triplett](/wiki/Antoine_Triplett/Framework) [[src]](/wiki/All_the_Madame%27s_Men) Like all the other [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D./Framework) agents, Simmons mourned the loss of the [Patriot](/wiki/Patriot). She also learned about the attack on [Madame Hydra](/wiki/Aida) and the fact that [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) and [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) were on the run. In the meantime, Simmons studied the documents brought by [Antoine Triplett](/wiki/Antoine_Triplett/Framework), that he had stolen while he was working undercover at [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA/Framework). On one of the pictures, along with the mention \" [Project Looking Glass](/wiki/Project_Looking_Glass)\", Simmons recognized the design of [Quantum Batteries](/wiki/Quantum_Batteries) and worried about what [Aida](/wiki/Aida) was creating. Simmons took a [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) with Triplett and the two headed to [Ivanov Oil Platform](/wiki/Ivanov_Oil_Platform). The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents infiltrated the building but found no equipment related to what was shown by Triplett's documents. Simmons figured out that Aida was actually building a reactor to create a human body in the real world, not in the [Framework](/wiki/Framework). Triplett informed her that they had to hurry up if they wanted to stop Madame Hydra from completing her plans, since HYRA was on the verge of succeeding. Back on the Quinjet, Simmons watched the S.H.I.E.L.D. subversive broadcast featuring [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson). [[87]](#cite_note-AoS419-87) Escaping the Framework[ ] Simmons returned to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground) where she was reunited with [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson). She informed her friend about [Aida](/wiki/Aida)'s plans and in return, Johnson told Simmons about the backdoor in the [Framework](/wiki/Framework) built by [Holden Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe). Johnson for the moment. Simmons reluctantly agreed since Fitz was out of their reach for the moment. Later, Simmons discussed with May and learned the reason of Fitz's cruel and ruthless personality in the Framework: [his father](/wiki/Alistair_Fitz/Framework). She then rushed at Alistair Fitz's house in order to demand his assistance by pointing a gun at him. Simmons ordered him to call his son and make him come to Alistair's house alone. However, Alistair Fitz chose to warn his son about the presence of a subversive, making a whole team of HYDRA agents to come. A brief fight ensued between Simmons and Alistair Fitz. The HYDRA officer quickly overwhelmed Simmons, who had no choice but shooting him, all of that while the Doctor was still listening on the phone. Horrified, Simmons fled and went back to the Playground and told Johnson about what happened, distressed by the fact that Fitz would never follow them now that his father was dead. Simmons and Johnson then took a [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) with Coulson, May and Mackenzie to go to the steel mill where the backdoor was located. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents quickly discovered that the backdoor was hidden in a bulk of molten metal designed by Aida. A brief argument erupted between the agents, especially since Mackenzie had not been told about the existence of another world. Fortunately, Johnson could use her powers to reveal it. They had to do it quickly since a HYDRA team led by The Doctor had stormed the steel mill. The Doctor, followed by Radcliffe, found Simmons and sought revenge for the death of his father. Simmons attempted to draw out the man she knew and loved from The Doctor, but she was unsuccessful. Confirming that he felt nothing but anger for Simmons, he shot her in the leg, forcing her to kneel, and prepared to kill her. However, The Doctor was suddenly disarmed by Radcliffe, who apologized for all the wrong he had done and what had happened to Fitz. The fallen scientist then threw The Doctor through the backdoor, and Simmons followed him, waking up in the real world while the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) was being attacked by [Anton Ivanov](/wiki/Anton_Ivanov)'s men. [[88]](#cite_note-AoS420-88) Back to the Real World[ ] - \"She's afraid [Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)will be the same guy he was in the [Framework](/wiki/Framework).\" \"No. She's afraid he the crew of the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) did not need to use large amounts of power to still keep the [Framework](/wiki/Framework) running. Simmons, Johnson and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) soon managed to activate the plane's weapon system so that [Piper](/wiki/Piper) could take down their enemy. [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) then brought the plane to [Ivanov Oil Platform](/wiki/Ivanov_Oil_Platform) in order to rescue their friends who had also left the Framework. They arrived right before the destruction of the platform and saved [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and Simmons and Piper used [I.C.E.R.s](/wiki/I.C.E.R.) on Fitz and Aida. The team returned to a destroyed [Playground](/wiki/Playground), where Simmons put the Zephyr One's [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module) in one of the remaining Containment Chamber. Simmons talked with Coulson and May about their experience in the Framework and how it felt in their mind since she was afraid that Fitz could have kept some of his Framework's traits, like his cruelty or his love for Aida. Through the video feed of the Containment Chamber, Simmons monitored the conversation between Fitz and Aida when they discussed what had happened in the Framework and burst into tears when she heard Fitz lamenting over the fact that his future with Simmons was destroyed. However, the situation quickly went even worse. Indeed, although Simmons smiled upon hearing that Fitz still loved her and only her, it drove Aida insane. Simmons tried to reach the Containment Chamber in order to take Fitz out of it, but she was stopped by soldiers sent by [Glenn Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot), who was fearing that all of [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) top personnel had been replaced by [androids](/wiki/Life-Model_Decoy) and gone rogue. Piper brought Fitz back on the plane, who ordered them to take off the plane, which they did in order to escape from Aida's attacks. After taking off, Simmons saw her boyfriend sadly sitting in the Containment Module. She hesitated for a few seconds before joining him in comfort, hugging him and holding his hand. The two cried together, traumatized by their experience in the Framework, but finally reunited. [[89]](#cite_note-AoS421-89) Fighting Aida[ ] Since [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) was heavily vulnerable to [Aida](/wiki/Aida)'s assaults, Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) tried to figure out a way to stop her. Fitz told Simmons about the [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans) he had been studying in the [Framework](/wiki/Framework), assessing their powers through painful and even lethal procedures, which included [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell/Framework), [Vijay Nadeer](/wiki/Vijay_Nadeer/Framework) and [Gordon](/wiki/Gordon/Framework). Fitz lamented over the fact that he was unable to find an efficient solution to stop Aida and that his ideas had only brought pain and death so far. Simmons replied that this was the kind of idea they needed because Aida had to be killed. However, when Simmons asked Fitz if he really wanted to kill Aida, she received an alarm before he could answer. Indeed, Aida was shutting down the Framework, deleting all the elements in it and thus threatening the lives of [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) and [Elena Rodriguez](/wiki/Elena_Rodriguez) who were still trapped in it. When S.H.I.E.L.D. finally retrieved the [Darkhold](/wiki/Darkhold) from Aida with assistance of [Ghost Rider](/wiki/Ghost_Rider), [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) devised a plan to lure Aida and stop her. In order to complete this plan, he asked Simmons and Fitz to put aside their emotional troubles about what had happened in the Framework. Simmons and Fitz silently nodded, ready to work together. Coulson's plans involved going back to the [Playground](/wiki/Playground) and replacing Simmons with a [Life-Model Decoy](/wiki/Jemma_Simmons/Life-Model_Decoy) in order to fool Aida. The trickery worked and Simmons then managed to shoot Aida multiple times, though the crazed Inhuman easily recovered thanks to her powers. Aida mocked Simmons for trying to kill her with a simple weapon, but Simmons retorted that she only wanted to hurt her. Then, Aida teleported, but could not get rid of Coulson, who had borrowed the powers of the [Spirit of Vengeance](/wiki/Spirit_of_Vengeance). When they returned to the Playground, Simmons, who had been joined by Fitz, found them and watched Aida being killed once and for all by Coulson. Simmons prepared an [Inter-Dimensional Gate](/wiki/Inter-Dimensional_Gate) so that Ghost Rider could return to [Hell](/wiki/Dark_Dimension). However, the Rider declared that he did not need it, since he could open portals on his own. After that, the agents were warned by Mackenzie and Rodriguez, who had escaped the Framework, that soldiers were coming for them. Fitz offered to stay behind and turn over himself in order to make amends for his mistakes, but Simmons and the others made him understand that they had forgiven him and that they had to stay together. [[90]](#cite_note-AoS422-90) Trapped in the Future[ ] Taken from the Present[ ] Under Coulson's suggestion, they all then decided to go to [Rae's Restaurant](/wiki/Rae%27s_Restaurant) and enjoy a meal together before potentially being arrested. [[90]](#cite_note-AoS422-90) As they sat in the diner, Simmons noticed Fitz not eating as he was still feeling guilty. [[91]](#cite_note-AoS505-91) Suddenly the lights shut off and a mysterious [man](/wiki/Enoch) leading an armed squad entered to take them. The man used a Stasis Device to stun them and bring them to the [Time Di'Alla](/wiki/Time_Di%27Alla), which liquified and transported them to the year [2091](/wiki/2091). [[90]](#cite_note-AoS422-90) Arrival at the Lighthouse[ ] - \"Believe it or not, Mack, this isn't new for me. I've been hurled through space by a [Monolith](/wiki/Monolith)before. Best we can do is keep our heads and apply the scientific method.\" - Jemma Simmons to [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) [[src]](/wiki/Orientation_Part_One) Following her arrest, Simmons was sent into the future through the [Time Di'Alla](/wiki/Time_Di%27Alla) and brought to the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). She quickly found dead bodies and hypothesized that they had died because of toxic air. She wore a mask found on the ground, which had no point but frightening [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez), who had found her. Both of them investigated the corpses and discovered that their innards had been completely drained. They were joined by [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) and [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson), who informed them that the Lighthouse was invaded by [aliens](/wiki/Vrellnexians) and that they were in space, much to Simmons' dismay who had hoped never having to undergo such an experience. When [Virgil](/wiki/Virgil), who had been knocked unconscious by Mackenzie, finally woke up, he told Simmons and the others that they were here to save humanity. Before he could proceed further, however, he was killed by a Vrellnexian. The [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) team fled and was ultimately saved by [Quake](/wiki/Quake). Simmons and the others began exploring the Lighthouse, trying to figure out their situation. They arrived into a room with human bodies and computer equipment with alien writings. Three [Kree](/wiki/Kree) guards then arrived and arrested the team, locking them in a cell. However, they were released thanks to [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw), who told them that Virgil hired him to hide them in the Lighthouse, though he was reluctant to do so. After interrogating him, Simmons and [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) went to find the [Trawler](/wiki/Trawler), the Lighthouse's spaceship. On their way, Simmons hypothesized that the Kree were using the Lighthouse as a base of command for an impending invasion of [Earth](/wiki/Earth). However, after flying the Trawler, they discovered that the truth was even worse then they initially theorized: they had been sent to the future, and in this future, Earth had been completely destroyed. [[92]](#cite_note-AoS501-92) Meeting Kasius[ ] - \"We've hit the ' [North Korean](/wiki/North_Korea)dictator' level of creepy.\" - Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Orientation_Part_Two) After avoiding collision with a massive asteroid, Simmons and [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) returned the [Trawler](/wiki/Trawler) to the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse) where they reunited with [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) and reported their discovery. They later met with [Tess](/wiki/Tess), who was shocked to learn about the presence of agents of [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) and decided to guide them through the Lighthouse. Tess led Simmons and the others to the Exchange, an area devoted to trading items. Simmons stayed there with May and attended a food distribution. A fight erupted between two survivors and [Reese](/wiki/Reese_(Lighthouse)), a [human](/wiki/Humans) servant of the [Kree](/wiki/Kree), was wounded in the process. Simmons tended to his wounds and [Sinara](/wiki/Sinara), intrigued by her altruistic behavior, ordered her Kree guards to seize Simmons. Simmons was taken to the upper levels of the Lighthouse, where she met [Kasius](/wiki/Kasius), the Kree leader of the Lighthouse. Kasius interrogated Simmons to know where her medical knowledge came from and why she healed Reese. He also noted that Simmons did not wear a [Metric](/wiki/Metrics) and doubted Simmons' answers. He decided to keep Simmons to his service and had Reese brought to him. As Reese's wounds would leave him with scars, especially on his forehead, Kasius had him executed by Sinara for not being perfect, much to Simmons' horror. Simmons tried to protest, but Kasius silenced her by injecting a strange fluid in her ear, which rendered her completely deaf. Afterwards, Simmons was turned into one of Kasius' servants. [[93]](#cite_note-AoS502-93) Abby's Training[ ] Simmons attended a discussion between [Kasius](/wiki/Kasius) and Lady [Basha](/wiki/Basha)'s Emissary and even if she could not hear what was being said, she saw Kasius having a brutal access of rage after the Emissary's departure and something [Tye](/wiki/Tye) said. Then Kasius, following [Sinara](/wiki/Sinara)'s advice, told Simmons that he was counting on her to solve a problem of his. The problem turned out to be [Abby](/wiki/Abby), a young [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans) who was having trouble controlling her newfound density manipulation powers. Tye told Simmons that she had to help Abby. After patient discussions, Simmons learned that Abby was supposed to demonstrate her powers during a ceremony. Abby described her powers to Simmons, who used the information to figure out Abby's powers' mechanisme. With Simmons' help, Abby eventually mastered her abilities. Upon learning that, Kasius came back and took Abby for the ceremony, despite Simmons asking for more time to practice. Simmons then had to witness the fight between Abby and The [Beast](/wiki/Beast), [Basha](/wiki/Basha)'s fighter. She was shocked and distressed to see her apprentice violently beaten up and nearly killed. However, Simmons caught Abby's look and whispered her advice, which Abby successfully used to defeat The Beast. Following the fight, Abby was sold to Basha. Simmons tried to interfere, but she was kept from it by Sinara, and Kasius complimented Simmons over her work. [[94]](#cite_note-AoS503-94) Capture of Daisy Johnson[ ] When [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) was captured by [Kasius](/wiki/Kasius), he brought Simmons to her interrogation and threatened to hurt Simmons if Johnson did not comply. Later, [Sinara](/wiki/Sinara) abruptly arrived to Kasius' apartments and accused Simmons of lying about her history and Johnson's, as Sinara recalled [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) helping Simmons tending to [Reese](/wiki/Reese_(Lighthouse))'s wounds and suspected that Simmons and May knew each other. Johnson was brought to the room for interrogation, as well as [Ben](/wiki/Ben), an [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans) capable of reading other people's mind. Kasius ordered Johnson to tell her history, using Ben to check whether what she said was true and keeping Simmons from reading through her lips. However, Ben was also able to implant thoughts into Simmons' mind: With his help, Simmons was able to repeat Johnson's story so that Kasius was convinced that the two were telling the truth. [[95]](#cite_note-AoS504-95) Released and Engaged[ ] Simmons prepared some food for [Kasius](/wiki/Kasius)' attendees who had come for his auction. At first, she was unaware that [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) was right behind her, confessing his love and proposing to her. When Kasius came by, Simmons stared at her boyfriend in complete awe and thanks to Fitz, Kasius turned off Simmons' ear implant, allowing her to hear again. Kasius then sent Simmons to see if the [Kree Watch](/wiki/Kree_Watch) had harvested more [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans). She returned in the evening to serve the bidders over dinner, exchanging furtive looks with Fitz and stealing his knife as a possible weapon. Later, Simmons attended the fight between [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) and [Ben](/wiki/Ben) and was relieved when Fitz managed to end it by advising Kasius to send May to the [Earth](/wiki/Earth)'s surface. Kasius gathered his guests and his Inhumans and revealed that he knew about Ben's lies regarding Simmons' friends being present at the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). Simmons helplessly watched Ben being executed by [Sinara](/wiki/Sinara). She later went to see [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) before her fight. They discussed about Fitz's appearance and how the three of them could work together in order to break free from Kasius' rule. After leaving Johnson, Simmons saw Fitz at the other end of a corridor but before they could be reunited, another servant called Simmons as a situation required her attention: [Faulnak](/wiki/Faulnak), Kasius' brother, had arrived and intended to take part in the auction. Simmons returned to the arena's overlook to watch Johnson's fight against Sinara. When Johnson defeated her opponent, Fitz and Simmons made their move: Simmons cut Kasius' left cheek and jumped into the arena, followed by Fitz who reactivated the barrier preventing the other bidders and the guards to chase them. Simmons and Fitz, finally reunited, shared a passionate kiss and Simmons asked Fitz to marry her, to which her boyfriend fully agreed. The couple then picked up Johnson, who had been hurt in the fight, and left the arena, with Fitz insisting that he did propose first. [[96]](#cite_note-AoS506-96) To The Surface[ ] While Simmons, [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) and [Quake](/wiki/Quake) were trying to escape through Kasius' Suites, the [Kree](/wiki/Kree) tried to stop them by messing with Simmons' hearing implant, forcing her to stop. Fitz managed to pull the implant out of her ear while Quake took down a Kree guard. Fitz intended to take Simmons and Quake to the [Chronicom Vessel](/wiki/Chronicom_Vessel) he had used to come to the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse), but the spaceship was destroyed by the Kree, leaving them with no escape. They reached an elevator, hoping to find the rest of the [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) team, but the elevator was stopped by [Maston-Dar](/wiki/Maston-Dar), forcing them to escape through the elevator shaft. They arrived in the room where the artificial gravity of the Lighthouse was created with [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium), and Maston-Dar found them and wounded Fitz. Simmons helped Fitz to escape after Quake briefly fought Maston-Dar. Hiding elsewhere in the Lighthouse, they were found once again, this time by [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw). While Quake and Shaw argued about the latter's betrayal, Simmons tended to Fitz's wounds. The S.H.I.E.L.D. agents then reluctantly agreed to follow Shaw. Together, they fled to the Salvage where they found the rest of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team, except [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May). Simmons kept looking after Fitz and after rescuing [Flint](/wiki/Flint) from the [Kree Watch](/wiki/Kree_Watch), they were surrounded by Kree led by Maston-Dar and [Sinara](/wiki/Sinara) and figured out that the only place to go was the surface of the [Earth](/wiki/Earth). The team, starting with Simmons and Fitz used Shaw's [Gravity Puck](/wiki/Gravity_Puck) to create a gravity well they used to float upwards and reach the [Trawler](/wiki/Trawler). Once they all were onboard, except [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez), who stayed behind, Coulson attempted to fly the ship to the surface. Simmons and Fitz sat together and buckled in, deciding to never leave each other's sight again. After Simmons expressed her desire to have a drink, Fitz claimed he was just happy to have some peaceful time alone. Suddenly, they began to lose control over the Trawler and prepared for a crash landing. [[97]](#cite_note-AoS507-97) New Place, Old Plane[ ] Following the crash of the [Trawler](/wiki/Trawler), Simmons and the other [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) agents were rescued by [True Believers](/wiki/True_Believers) led by [Samuel Voss](/wiki/Samuel_Voss) and brought to the remnants of the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), finally giving them a familiar place. Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) went to see the elderly [Robin Hinton](/wiki/Robin_Hinton/Destroyed_Earth) to get some answers from her as to how to save the world and return to their own, but Robin was still navigating between times and could not give them clear information. Simmons and Fitz then discovered a strange mechanism somewhere else on the plane, and Voss explained that it had been built by [Owen Shaw](/wiki/Owen_Shaw), [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw)'s father. After Voss left the room, Simmons and Fitz finally found themselves alone and began making out to celebrate their reunion. Later, Simmons took a look at [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)'s [Inhuman Control Device](/wiki/Inhuman_Control_Device) and told her that she was not able to pull it out as it was way too complex for her. [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) and [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) joined them and informed them that they had found a piece of the [Time Di'Alla](/wiki/Time_Di%27Alla), who turned out to fit in the mechanism discovered earlier by Simmons and Fitz. While the others left to find out whether more fragments of the Monolith were available, Simmons and Fitz kept studying the mechanism, but when Fitz tried to go out to share their findings with the others, they found themselves locked in the room. Indeed, the True Believers had turned on them in an attempt to stop Johnson from returning in the past and destroying the world. S.H.I.E.L.D. managed to defeat the True Believers, but Robin was killed in the fight, leaving the agents even more lost in the future. However, May told her friends that Robin had finally revealed that [Flint](/wiki/Flint) could have a key role to play in their endeavor to save the world. [[98]](#cite_note-AoS508-98) A Dangerous Plan[ ] Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) worked on repairing the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) so [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) could use it to return to the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse), but the task proved to be difficult. Simmons and Fitz explored the plane further and discovered that the plane had been upgraded with Fitz's designs he never had the chance to put into practice. Those designs relied on [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium), which could explain the [Destruction of Earth](/wiki/Destruction_of_Earth). While Fitz saw proof that they could not change the future, Simmons remained optimistic and considered their discovery evidence that they successfully returned to their time. As a gravity storm was approaching, threatening to damage the plane, Simmons saw [Robin Hinton](/wiki/Robin_Hinton/Destroyed_Earth)'s wooden robin fly in the plane and came up with a new idea: using the gravity storm to take off the plane and then use the new thrusters to stabilize and fly the plane in outer space. Simmons told her idea to the team, which Fitz backed up, and the two worked through the logistics of the plan, fist bumping when reaching a successful conclusion to her idea. S.H.I.E.L.D. agreed to follow Simmons' plan. Although the ground anchors initially got stuck, [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) managed to take off. The plane went through the gravity storm, causing heavy disturbances which led Simmons to question her plan, stating that it was a bad idea after all. However, May successfully flew through the storm into outer space. Once in safety, Simmons and Fitz requested the shard of the [Time Di'Alla](/wiki/Time_Di%27Alla) from [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) so they could use it to return in their time. [[99]](#cite_note-AoS509-99) Constructing the Time Di'Alla[ ] The team then made it to the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse) where they continued their plan to construct the [Time Di'Alla](/wiki/Time_Di%27Alla). Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) then headed off to give [Flint](/wiki/Flint) the Time Di'Alla shard, which would allow for them to return to their time. The two found Flint who was with [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie), and the group began to start the construction process. When Flint began to doubt himself, Simmons guided him through the process, helping him understand and use his powers. Suddenly, they were interrupted by three [Kree Watch](/wiki/Kree_Watch) guards, causing them to flee. However, they were able to escape them due to Fitz planting a trap that killed them, causing Simmons to be shocked by Fitz's newly desensitized attitude. Simmons then made a plan for Flint to destroy the window in the suites, killing any Kree in their way. As Flint began forming rocks in space, Simmons, Fitz and Mackenzie made their way to the suites, where they rescued [Ava](/wiki/Ava) as Flint killed the Kree Watch. Flint then began to construct the Time Di'Alla, while Simmons removed Ava's [Silencing Implant](/wiki/Silencing_Implant) that she was given while a slave to [Kasius](/wiki/Kasius). The group was then joined by [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson), [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) and an unconscious [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) and the Time Di'Alla became complete and about to activate. As time went on, there was still no arrival of Mackenzie or [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez), so Simmons went out to look for them. She found Mackenzie being attacked by [Kasius](/wiki/Kasius), so she disabled him by inserting the hearing implant that she got from Ava, causing him to go deaf and be killed by Mackenzie. The two were then joined by Rodriguez, who Mackenzie thought was dead, and the three headed back to the Monolith, in hope to arrive before it activated. They fortunately made it in time and the team successfully transported back to the present. [[100]](#cite_note-AoS510-100) Return to the Present[ ] Back on Earth[ ] - \"The [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse)has a few covert entrances.\" \"This place has secret tunnels, like an [Agatha Christie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie)novel.\" - [Noah](/wiki/Noah)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/All_the_Comforts_of_Home) The team all arrived back on [Earth](/wiki/Earth) in [2017](/wiki/2017) where they found themselves still in the Lighthouse. The team took a moment to celebrate their return, but soon greeted by a pre-recorded message by General [Rick Stoner](/wiki/Rick_Stoner), informing them of the purpose of the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). Simmons then went to examine [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie)'s wounds from his fight with [Kasius](/wiki/Kasius), as well as announcing her wish to examine everyone due to their recent experience of an unexplored phenomenon, but [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) told her just to check on Mackenzie. The team then gathered together again when they were informed by [Noah](/wiki/Noah), a [Chronicom](/wiki/Chronicoms) anthropologist sent to Earth in order to study and record the history of [humans](/wiki/Humans), with residing in the Lighthouse, of an alien transmission signal going off. They were informed that the signal was going off at [St. Louis](/wiki/St._Louis), [Missouri](/wiki/Missouri), and that there were several tunnels that would lead them there undetected, which Simmons related to an [Agatha Christie novel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie_bibliography). The team, minus [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson), made their way through the tunnels that led them to [River's End](/wiki/River%27s_End). Once there the team took a moment to enjoy the environment after being trapped in space with a destroyed Earth for a while. They then hijacked a minibus and headed to where [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) had left a cloaked [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One). As they drove, the team recounted on the numerous situations they have encountered during their time in [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.). They were soon approached by a [police officer](/wiki/River%27s_End_Police_Department), but were not arrested, so they continued on their mission. They then found the Zephyr One and took off, where they had discovered the location of the signal and that it was being sent from Earth. They also discovered that the beacon sending the signal was the same one that [Hive](/wiki/Hive) used to summon the [Kree](/wiki/Kree). [[101]](#cite_note-AoS511-101) [Infiltration into St. Louis Aerospace Facility](/wiki/Infiltration_into_St._Louis_Aerospace_Facility)[ ] They team then made their way to [St. Louis Aerospace Facility](/wiki/St._Louis_Aerospace_Facility) where they would attempted to stop the signal. They then broke through the firewall where the came across [Piper](/wiki/Piper) who informed them about the beacon and that it was about to go off. Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) then went to examine the beacon and disabled it, discovering that most of the beacon was made by [humans](/wiki/Humans). At that moment, Piper then turned on them, revealing that she made a deal with General [Hale](/wiki/Hale) and that the beacon was only to lure them into a trap. As that happened, a few [Sleeper Mechs](/wiki/Sleeper_Mechs) arrived and the began to attack the team. Piper then realized that she had been played by Hale, and that the Mechs were attempting to kill their team. Simmons and Fitz then took the [Kree Orb](/wiki/Kree_Orb) and attempted to escape the facility while the rest fought off the Mechs, resulting in [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez)' arms being sliced off. The team managed to escape the facility as Simmons watched over Rodriguez, not being able to risk going to a hospital. The team arrived back at the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse) were Simmons performed surgery on Rodriguez, where she was able to save her. Simmons would then watch over Rodriguez as she slowly recovered from her injuries. [[101]](#cite_note-AoS511-101) Revealing Phil Coulson's Fate[ ] - \"How much more time does he have on his clock?\" \"Um, I won't be able to tell until I can chart its progression, but even now, he's at risk of various... At some point, sir, your heart will just stop beating.\" - [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/The_Real_Deal) When the team returned from their latest fight, they brought back the [Kree Orb](/wiki/Kree_Orb), unaware that it was a trap, and stored it in the storage room. [Hale](/wiki/Hale) then set off the Kree Orb to explode, but it was suppressed by [Noah](/wiki/Noah) who sacrificed himself containing the blast. However, the explosion was strong enough to destroy the three [Monoliths](/wiki/Monolith_(disambiguation)), causing a rift to form that accessed the [Fear Dimension](/wiki/Fear_Dimension). The team became aware of this rift and realized that the only way to close the rift, was through sending someone ready to sacrifice themselves. Meanwhile, Simmons cared for [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez), applying bandages to her arms. As the [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) agents argued about who they could send, [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) suddenly collapsed, so Simmons examined him and found out that the he was dying due to the deal he made with the [Spirit of Vengeance](/wiki/Spirit_of_Vengeance) destroyed what was keeping him alive when he was first killed by [Loki](/wiki/Loki). After discovering this, Coulson decided to close the rift while the rest watched over him upstairs. As soon as Coulson began to approach the rift, communication and visual was then cut, leaving them unaware of Coulson's situation. As they team waited, an alarm went off for an aircraft approaching, which turned out to be [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) returning with backup, including [Deathlok](/wiki/Deathlok). [[102]](#cite_note-AoS512-102) Long Expected Marriage[ ] - \"I knew from the moment I saw you, from our first conversation about dielectric polarization, that you'd be in my life for a long time. But I didn't know you would be my life. My heart. My home. We joined this [team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team)for adventures and got more than we had hoped. But I can't wait for our next adventure. Building a family together. My love for you grows deeper and always will, no matter where the universe takes us next.\" - Jemma Simmons to [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) [[src]](/wiki/The_Real_Deal) With the [Fear Dimension](/wiki/Fear_Dimension) momentarily contained and the [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) agents being relatively safe in the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse), Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) decided to go through with the wedding, after recently just being engaged. Simmons along with the rest of the team waited for Fitz in a level made entirely as a forest. With [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) officiating their wedding, Simmons and Fitz exchanged their vows and Simmons told Fitz that he was the most important thing to her and that she could not wait to continue their lives together. Fitz then put a ring on Simmons' hand, officially marrying her. The two then tenderly kissed while their friends happily cheered around them. [[102]](#cite_note-AoS512-102) Looking After Yo-Yo Rodriguez[ ] - \"I want to be with [Mack](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie)forever, and I want to have children with him.\" \"And you will. This doesn't change anything.\" - [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Principia_(episode)) Simmons primarily spent most of her time looking after [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) after she had gone out of surgery. She often checked on her status, seeing if she was suffering any pain and reported her progress, while also looking after her. Simmons went to check on Rodriguez again and found her on the ground. Simmons attempted to help Rodriguez, but she was too devastated that the future she wanted with [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) would not come true. Simmons then comforted her saying that the future she saw would not happen, but Rodriguez was hardly convinced. [[103]](#cite_note-AoS513-103) Quest for Gravitonium[ ] Simmons then joined her [husband](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) as they searched for the [Principia](/wiki/Principia), a lost ship transporting [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium), but were not able to locate the ship. Fitz then started to become frustrated with his failures, so Simmons comforted him. As Fitz started to get frustrated with [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw), causing him to leave, Simmons told Fitz to go easy on Shaw due to what he was experiencing and because she loved the wedding ring Shaw had picked out for her. The two then began to commemorate their recent marriage by jokingly calling each other \"husband\" and \"wife.\" Simmons then suggested that they should hyphen their names, only to realize that Simmons-Fitz sounded awkward. Simmons then headed down to find Shaw, who had just witnessed another [Fear Dimension](/wiki/Fear_Dimension) anomaly. She tried to get him to come back to help them, but he was too upset by Fitz constantly looking down on him. When Shaw began to get more mad, he then came to a realization on where the Principia could be. The two then returned to the control rooms where they searched the skies for the ship due to the Gravitonium affecting the ship. [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson), [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) and [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) then made their way to the Principia while the rest of the team observed from the control room. The team then located the Gravitonium and were able to contain it. The mission being a success, Simmons returned to Rodriguez and checked up on her patient, who told Simmons that she did not mean what she had said earlier. Rodriguez then noticed that Simmons was keeping the [Time Di'Alla](/wiki/Time_Di%27Alla) shard, which she said was in case of an emergency. Simmons then went on to tell Rodriguez to take it slow with the healing, saying the steps she took did not have to be big but just needed to take her in the right direction, a saying she would commonly say in the future. The two then noticed Shaw who began to act strangely and informed them of the team's return, which they attended to welcome their friends back from their [mission](/wiki/Battle_on_the_Principia). [[103]](#cite_note-AoS513-103) Leo Fitz's Psychic Split[ ] Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) began working on a new [Gravity Containment Device](/wiki/Gravity_Containment_Device) to help seal the rift from the [Fear Dimension](/wiki/Fear_Dimension). During a talk with Simmons, Fitz expressed his annoyance at the Fear Dimension, and wished for it to have been a 'wish dimension' instead. Simmons expressed that she would wish to be able to speak any language, have a honeymoon and have a flying pony. While talking with Fitz, an [astronaut](/wiki/Hive/Monolith_Recreation) attacked her but she eventually shot the astronaut until it turned to dust. Simmons, Fitz, [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) gathered in the control room where they brainstormed ideas to close the rift. The group decided to take a look at the old notes of [Franklin Hall](/wiki/Franklin_Hall) to better understand the properties of [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium), where Simmons and Fitz went to take a look in the database. Due to the increase in anomalies appearing, Simmons decided to move [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) into a safer location. As they prepared her, a [Sleeper Mech](/wiki/Sleeper_Mechs) entered and attacked them, shooting [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) who was able to destroy the android nonetheless. Fitz entered the room, where he informed them that the Doctor, Fitz's personality in the [Framework](/wiki/Framework), had arrived, which shocked Simmons, as this was her greatest fear. Simmons then tried to get Fitz to think about where the Doctor might be and what his plan was, which they discovered was to experiment on Johnson. When there was no knowledge of where Fitz and Johnson were, Simmons went out to look for them, where she discovered Fitz, who was suffering from a psychic split, performing surgery on Johnson against her will to remove her [Inhuman Control Device](/wiki/Inhuman_Control_Device). Simmons attempted to calm Fitz down, but his mind was too far gone, continuing with the painful procedure, summoning a Sleeper Mech to restrain Simmons and Shaw. Once the surgery was complete, Fitz got Johnson to use her powers to compress the Gravitonium into the Gravity Containment Device, which would then be able to close the rift. When the rift was closed, Fitz was locked up by Johnson and visited by Simmons. She asked about him seeing the Doctor, who Fitz heard since they left the Framework. Simmons attempted to defend Fitz and find a way to work it out, but he was determined that it was all him and that he believed his actions to still be the right one. Despite her confusion, Simmons sided with Fitz, believing that if the timeline was to be changed, certain brutal actions needed to be taken. Simmons, being overwhelmed by everything, sat by herself feeling unsure about where they should go from what had happened. She was then joined by Shaw who comforted her and began to reveal specific things about her and Fitz that prove they would be alright. Upon hearing this, Simmons figured out that Shaw was in fact their grandson which she was shocked about, but was interrupted by her throwing up. [[104]](#cite_note-AoS514-104) The Gravitonium Threat[ ] The Invincible Three[ ] - \" [Mack](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie)said you believe you can't die.\" \"I know it sounds crazy, Jemma-\" \"I don't think it's crazy. I believe it's true.\" \"I'm glad someone understands.\" \"I don't just mean you.\" Simmons and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) [[src]](/wiki/Rise_and_Shine) Simmons and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) to attach the [Sleeper Mech](/wiki/Sleeper_Mechs) [arms](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez%27s_Prosthetic_Arms) Mackenzie had brought back from the [Principia](/wiki/Principia). When they were done, they tested the arms to see if there was any distortion. As they did this, Mackenzie attempted to comfort Simmons by explaining what it was like being plugged in the [Framework](/wiki/Framework), saying that [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) was not a bad person in the real world but instead that he was somehow a good person in the Framework. They then finished the tests to find the surgery was a success, but Mackenzie was worried about Rodriguez believing that she was invincible due to seeing [herself](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez/Destroyed_Earth) in the future. Upon hearing this, Simmons started to believe that she was also invincible since [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw)'s existence meant that [she](/wiki/Jemma_Simmons/Destroyed_Earth) and [Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Bobo) made it to the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse) to have a [daughter](/wiki/Alya_Shaw). Simmons went to visit Fitz to inform him of the fact that Shaw was their grandson, which he was not happy about due to believing that Shaw was \"the worst.\" Simmons however thought that he was perfect, and then went to tell Fitz about that meant they make it to the future. [[105]](#cite_note-AoS515-105) Later, Simmons went to see Shaw to find out anything that might have happened in the future to them, but was disappointed as Shaw did not even know them growing up. However, she confirmed that they made it to the Lighthouse, alive and healthy enough to give birth and raise their daughter. Simmons then went to [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) to try and get Fitz released as she believed he could be of help in locating a [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) weapon, but was ordered that he would not be released while he was still sick. Despite this, Simmons knew that they needed to think differently if they were going to succeed, so she brought Rodriguez down to help her get Fitz out. Simmons told Rodriguez about Shaw and how that added to her theory of being invincible. She then told her that they had a lead to find [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) faster than Johnson, but they needed to release Fitz, which they needed Mackenzie for. They called him down, where they had set up an experiment to convince Mackenzie that she indeed could not be killed: four beakers, one filled with toxic phosphoric acid compound and three with water, which she intended to drink, believing that there was no chance of her drinking the wrong beaker. Despite Mackenzie and Fitz's worries, Simmons proceeded on the experiment and was able to drink the first two beakers. When she selected the third beaker, she then pretended to have chosen the wrong beaker, tricking Mackenzie into letting Fitz out. This allowed Rodriguez to trap Mackenzie in the room and let the three escape. When Fitz returned, finding out it was a trick, Simmons revealed that there was actually a poisonous beaker, adding to her belief of invincibility. The three then made their way to a [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) and headed off to [one](/wiki/England) of three locations where the HYDRA weapon could be. [[106]](#cite_note-AoS516-106) Honeymoon[ ] - \"I'm sorry you never got that honeymoon you dreamed of.\" \"Nonsense. I'm protecting [England](/wiki/England)from [evil robots](/wiki/Sleeper_Mechs)with - [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/The_Honeymoon) The three arrived at the first possible location at [Herefordshire](/wiki/Herefordshire), [England](/wiki/England) where they would hope to find the [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) weapon to help them. Simmons was glad to be back home, but wished it was under better circumstances as they prepared for the mission. Simmons then stated to [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) that she wished to return to England for their honeymoon if they were ever able to get one. The three then jumped out of the [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) and headed towards the facility. As they approached the facility, they discovered a radio frequency present which turned out to by [Anton Ivanov](/wiki/Anton_Ivanov) and a fleet of [Sleeper Mechs](/wiki/Sleeper_Mechs). They then made their way into the facility, having to take extra precaution in doing so, until they came across Ivanov, who they were able to distract with some explosions going off outside that they had set up. Simmons then discovered a hidden room behind a wall which was where they found the weapon. As they destroyed the weapons, they began to doubt themselves, believing they had probably already attempted this in another timeline and were never successful. They then asked [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) about what she discovered from talking to her future self, which was that they need to let Coulson die. Just then, a group of Mechs attempted to break in so Rodriguez went to disarm the Mechs, but was unable to due to her new arms not being able to handle the speed. They were then left with no other option but to fight off the Mechs. Due to making a new rule never to leave each others side, Simmons and Fitz decided to stay and fight, allowing Rodriguez to get out and call for backup from the Quinjet. Simmons and Fitz then forted themselves in the room and began to face off against the incoming Mechs. They soon became overwhelmed by Mechs coming from both ends as they had nearly exhausted their ammunition, but the two stilled had faith that they would make it. They then completely exhausted their ammunition, causing remaining Mechs to approach them as they held each other in the potential final moments, which were short lived by the Mechs suddenly shutting down due to Ivanov being defeated by Rodriquez. They then inspected the Mechs as they discussed their fortunate survival, which altered their previous belief of being invincible. Suddenly, a [Chakram](/wiki/Chakram) was thrown at them, hitting the table, which was revealed to be thrown by [Ruby Hale](/wiki/Ruby_Hale) accompanied by [Werner von Strucker](/wiki/Werner_von_Strucker). They discovered that they had destroyed a component to the weapon, stopping them from transferring the [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium), causing them to threaten Simmons so that they will repair it. Simmons told Fitz that they can't let it happen, but Fitz informed her that they don't have a choice, nor did they ever. [[107]](#cite_note-AoS517-107) Repairing the Chamber[ ] Simmons was then tied up and threatened by [Ruby Hale](/wiki/Ruby_Hale), forcing [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) to repair the components that they had destroyed. Fitz then told Ruby to stop threatening Simmons and that he needed her in order to repair the component. Ruby freed Simmons and the two began to work on the component. Simmons then tried to warn Ruby about what would happen if she goes through with her plan, but she didn't care. [Werner von Strucker](/wiki/Werner_von_Strucker) then returned and informed them that [Anton Ivanov](/wiki/Anton_Ivanov) was dead, Simmons realizing that it was [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) who killed him and was making her way to the [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet). They then watched as Ruby was given a crate with [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium), causing them to discuss their possibilities. They decided that they won't risk each other's lives, so they will repair the chamber, but attempt to do it as slowly as possible. As they continued to repair the chamber, Ruby started to get frustrated with the pace of their work, so she grabbed Simmons and threatened to torture her. Strucker then noticed that they had built the device in reverse, causing Ruby to consider killing Simmons. Fitz then tried to defend Simmons, but Ruby then started to brutally punch him, as Simmons was forced to watch. Simmons then begged her to stop, saying that they will fix the error, but Ruby stated that next time she will attack Simmons, and she will use her [Chakram](/wiki/Chakram). They then returned to repairing the chamber, now having to fix it properly and faster. Ruby then went to threaten to cut their limbs, but Fitz told her that they were finished. Strucker then turned on the chamber as Simmons warned Ruby that the Gravitonium is not easy to manipulate. They Gravitonium successfully transferred into the chamber and Ruby went inside and began the infusion process. Simmons and Fitz then watched as Ruby screamed out in pain due to the infusion. Strucker then threatened Simmons and Fitz saying that they had sabotaged the chamber, but [Hale](/wiki/Hale) along with [Quake](/wiki/Quake) and [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) entered, telling him that it wasn't the chamber. They then shutdown the chamber, which had only infused 8% of Gravitonium. Ruby then exited the chamber, floating and began to lose control of herself, killing Strucker. Ruby then told them to put her back in the chamber to remove the voices, but Simmons told her it only works one way. Ruby then attacked the two, forcing them against a wall, but Hale stopped her. Simmons and Fitz then escaped with May as Quake and Hale stayed to try and calm Ruby down. They then ran into Rodriguez, who had returned from the Quinjet, realized that Quake was still in there. The three returned to find Ruby dead and Hale gone. Simmons checked on Rodriguez, whose arms were getting worse. Rodriguez then informed them that she had killed Ruby, believing that to have saved the world. [[108]](#cite_note-AoS518-108) Upgrading the Zephyr One[ ] - \"On the [Zephyr](/wiki/Zephyr_One), RCS thrusters are operational on the [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium).\" \"We're nearly finished extracting residual traces from the [machine](/wiki/Particle_Infusion_Chamber), which seems to have refined the element in some way.\" - [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth)and Jemma Simmons to [Phil to the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse) where [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) informed everyone about their plan to destroy the [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium), by throwing it into the sun. Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) had begun working on the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) so it would be applicable for space travel. They were still working on finding a way to extract Gravitonium to power the engines. The group then began to argue amongst themselves about [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) killing [Ruby Hale](/wiki/Ruby_Hale), Simmons siding with Rodriguez believing Ruby to have been too uncontrollable. Coulson then broke up the argument and ordered everyone to do their jobs. Simmons, Fitz and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) returned to their lab and began extracting Gravitonium while Shaw began talking about the Multiverse theory and that he is proof of that. Fitz however believed that they were stuck in the one timeline in a loop, which Simmons hoped that they would break once they destroy the Gravitonium and save the world. They then gave Shaw the Gravitonium for him to protect whole he went to the Zephyr One, warning him that the Gravitonium is unpredictable. [[109]](#cite_note-AoS519-109) [Siege of the Lighthouse](/wiki/Siege_of_the_Lighthouse)[ ] Moments later, an [alien ship](/wiki/Qovas%27_Ship) arrived over the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse) and a few [Remorath](/wiki/Remorath) infiltrated the inside. After [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) had escaped from an attack, he informed everyone who they were and that there was no stopping them. [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) then ordered Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) to try and find a way to override the lockdown setting that Coulson had accidentally activated. Fitz then found an analog override which required him to make a bypass, so [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) and Shaw went to get to the hangar while Simmons readied the Gravitonium for travel. Despite this going against their \"Never Leaving Each Other's Side\" rule, Simmons and Fitz knew that they had to do this, as they had no other option. As Fitz made his way to level 17, Simmons radioed him worrying if maybe they shouldn't have separated, but Fitz reassured her. Simmons, along with [Piper](/wiki/Piper) and [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) started to prepare the Gravitonium for travel as Coulson informed them that an evacuation is no longer possible. Simmons then informed everyone that the Gravitonium might not be able to move, due to the stairs. Fitz then told her that Shaw was trying to get one of the elevators working and that the Remorath's have the ability to disable technology. Simmons then informed Piper and Davis of this information as the doors attempted to be breached. The three then prepared to fight off the incoming attack, but it turned out to be [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) and [Glenn Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot), who told them that the Remorath's were coming. This then caused them to be pinned down in the lab, deciding that they would make their stand there, instead of the control room with everyone else. She then informed Fitz about their situation, causing him to regret leaving her. She then asked if Shaw had blinked out of existence, which he hadn't, so she then believed them to be alright. Rodriguez, Piper and Davis went outside to defend to lab, while Simmons stayed inside with Talbot to be the last line of defence of the Gravitonium. Simmons then waited in the lab, preparing to fire at anything that entered the room, when they heard from Coulson to not come to the control room as they were trapped. She then turned around to notice Talbot observing the chamber. When Simmons attempted to stop him, he then pulled an [I.C.E.R.](/wiki/I.C.E.R.) out shot her, knocking her out. Rodriguez then returned after the fight to find Simmons trapped under some shelf, just coming to from being shot. She then asked where Talbot was, and the both discovered that he had infused himself with the Gravitonium. [[109]](#cite_note-AoS519-109) Centipede Serum[ ] - \"I finally got the compound right. Should only take a few days to synthesize. It's funny, isn't it? The [Centipede Serum](/wiki/Centipede_Serum)was part of our first mission, and now it's the key to curing [Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson). We've come full circle.\" - Jemma Simmons to [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) [[src]](/wiki/The_Force_of_Gravity) Simmons regrouped with the rest of their team in the control room to find out that [Glenn Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot) had taken [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) to [Qovas' Ship](/wiki/Qovas%27_Ship). She informed them that Talbot had been infused with all the [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium), which she described the side effects as catastrophic, fearing that he will suffer a major psychotic break. Simmons and [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) then went to check on [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) who was hunting down any remaining [Remoraths](/wiki/Remorath). They stopped him before he killed the last one, tying it up and attempted to interrogate him. Simmons was then handed a vile of [Odium](/wiki/Odium), curious about how the substance works. Unfortunately, the Remorath suddenly died, causing them to only find out how it works by cutting him up, which May and Mackenzie ordered Simmons to do, which she was not fully happy to do. Simmons then performed an autopsy on the Remorath to try and find out how the Odium works. Simmons was cutting into the Remorath's heart when [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) returned asking about what she was doing. Johnson then showed Simmons a [Centipede Device](/wiki/Centipede_Device) which told her to start working on to use to save [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)'s life. She then told her that she could combine it with [Jiaying](/wiki/Jiaying)'s DNA, as she had also dug up her bones. Simmons expressed her doubt in Johnson's idea, feeling that it crossed a line, but Johnson wasn't willing to let Coulson die. She then ordered Simmons to start working on saving Coulson. Simmons then started trying to find a way to combine the [Centipede Serum](/wiki/Centipede_Serum) with Jiaying's DNA as the rest of the team went to give Coulson backup. [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) then announced to Simmons that the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) had successfully made it to space, and Simmons assured him that it was thanks to his design. She then asked if he was okay not being in the control room to help, but Fitz said it was better off that way. The two then discussed how the combining was going to work and whether it was a good idea for them to do this. Simmons stated that she felt that the less they talked about it, the better it would be and she then told Fitz to obtain a sample from the corpse. [[110]](#cite_note-AoS520-110) The two continued toward on the cure, still unsure about doing it as they didn't think Johnson's plan would work. They then ran another simulation on the procedure as they weren't comfortable with doing it. As they ran through the simulation, they expressed doubt due to what they were told from [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez), that saving Coulson is how they lose. Which led to Fitz informing Simmons on a theory that if Coulson didn't die, then they wouldn't lose, changing the timeline. They then went back into extracting a cure, now in belief that they can save Coulson and the world. Simmons then informed Fitz that it was done, and they had successfully found a way to create the cure. [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) then arrived, and when they informed him of their plan. He then told them about [Glenn Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot), who had begun killing people. He then asked if there was a way for them to reverse what had been done to him, which Simmons informed him that they will work on it. They then began to work on a way to reverse the effects of the [Gravitonium](/wiki/Gravitonium), which came to be inconclusive. As they did this, Simmons worked on the cure, which she said would take a few days to synthesize. This then caused Simmons to reminisce about how the Centipede Serum was the start of their missions as a team, and that know it is how they will cure Coulson. They then started to discuss how they could stop Talbot, which Simmons suggested that they could use the Odium. However, they realized that it still wouldn't be strong enough to kill him. She then suggested that they use the Centipede Serum to deliver the [Odium](/wiki/Odium) straight to his cells. Simmons then received a call from Coulson and Johnson, who was returning from [Qovas' Ship](/wiki/Qovas%27_Ship), asking if May and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) had returned. They arrived just as he asked and she informed him that Mackenzie and Rodriguez had also returned after facing Talbot, informing them that [Carl Creel](/wiki/Carl_Creel) had been killed. She then told them that she will inform them of the rest when they return.

However, [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) informed them that there was no more serum. They all then realized that they could only save Coulson or save the world. [[111]](#cite_note-AoS521-111) The team then began to argue on what they should do, Simmons believing that they shouldn't save Coulson as she realized that this is what [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) meant by saving Coulson was how they lose. As they argued, Johnson decided that they were saving Coulson, but Yo-Yo grabbed the [Centipede Device](/wiki/Centipede_Device) desperately trying to beg them to change their mind. [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) then calmed her down and decided that they take a vote, when suddenly [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) destroyed the Odium. Simmons and Fitz then, with no other option, went to prepare the remedy. They successfully created the cure and Simmons went to inform Coulson, who had woken up. Coulson expressed that he did not want to take the serum, which Simmons understood and tried to inform him that they had no other choice, when May interrupted and asked her to give them a moment. [[112]](#cite_note-AoS522-112) [Battle of Chicago](/wiki/Battle_of_Chicago)[ ] - not breathing.\" \"No, the [serum](/wiki/Centipede_Serum)should worked, effects.\" \"He didn't take it.\" - [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis)and The team then discovered that [Glenn Talbot](/wiki/Glenn_Talbot) had landed in [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago), so they all headed there in the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One). [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) then informed them that they needed to stop Talbot, but more importantly save the civilians and [Polly](/wiki/Polly_Hinton) and [Robin Hinton](/wiki/Robin_Hinton). [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) then spoke to the team about her role as leader which she decided to appoint Mackenzie, claiming him to be the moral center. Everyone agreed with Johnson's decision and [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) then joined them, believing that he had taken the [Centipede Serum](/wiki/Centipede_Serum). They then landed in Chicago where Simmons assisted in evacuating the civilians into the Zephyr One. Simmons and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) stayed in the Zephyr One as they waited for [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) to return with Coulson. When they did arrive, Simmons then ordered for them to leave so they could be safe from the fight between Quake and Talbot. Suddenly, Davis came in dragging Coulson, whose heart had stopped beating. Simmons was unsure of why the serum hadn't worked, not knowing he didn't take it. Davis then informed her that he hadn't taken it, so ran to the med lab to retrieve the serum only to find that it wasn't there. She then returned, telling Rodriguez to get a defibrillator but she was already trying to revive him. Rodriguez was able to revive Coulson and they all headed for the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). [[112]](#cite_note-AoS522-112) Leo Fitz's Death[ ] - \"You don't have to forget, but you have to move on.\" \"No. With respect, sir, you're wrong. We don't move on. We hold that place in our heart. We close it off, we lock the door, visit from time to time. But we don't move on, even after we say goodbye.\" - [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/The_End) Simmons then looked after [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson), after he nearly died, just as the team returned from [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago). Later, [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) then entered, sadly informing her that [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) had died during the [battle](/wiki/Battle_of_Chicago), devastating her. Simmons then started packing Fitz's stuff while mourning his death. [[112]](#cite_note-AoS522-112) However, after seeing Fitz's tool, Simmons realized that there is still a version of Fitz from the present frozen in space, which she expressed to the team who did not know what to think of her theory or what to even say to her. Later, [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) were able to retrieve Fitz's body from Chicago and bring it back to the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). Mackenzie went to inform Simmons of this and she came out to see her husband one last time. However, she became very emotional and broke down, so she was comforted by [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson). As she comforted her, Johnson then gave her Fitz's ring and Coulson then entered to see Fitz. Coulson addressed Simmons' theory, which she assured him she was sure of, so he told her to get to work, giving her his final order. [[8]](#cite_note-AoS606-8) Phil Coulson's Retirement[ ] - \"Your team always worked the problem, no matter what the odds.\" \"And now [he](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)'s frozen, out in deep space somewhere, no idea he's already solved it.\" \"He'll be a little disoriented. But he'll be so happy to know that time is not fixed. It's a fluid, ever-changing, beautiful thing.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) [[src]](/wiki/The_End) They all then gathered together to celebrate [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)'s retirement, Simmons joining them a little later. They all then reminisced together about their time they spent of the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) and [Melinda the [Bus](/wiki/Bus), and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) wishing she had known them earlier, to which Simmons too her they were different people back then. Coulson then gave a speech to his team, calling all of them heroes and that they all sign on to lose people and that they should move on when he dies. Simmons disagreed with this, saying that you don't move on but hold that place close to your heart. Coulson then expressed his disappointment in not being able to say goodbye to [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) before he dies, but he Simmons assured him that she will tell him once they find him. Coulson then said his final goodbyes and he and May left the Zephyr One as they had landed in [Tahiti](/wiki/Tahiti). Simmons, along with the rest of the team all joined at the cockpit as they flew away from Tahiti, saying goodbye to Coulson. Simmons would then start to search for Fitz, who was frozen in deep space. [[112]](#cite_note-AoS522-112) [Searching for Leo Fitz](/wiki/Search_for_Leo_Fitz)[ ] Months in Space[ ] - \"The [ship](/wiki/Chronicom_Vessel)should have been off radar, undetectable.

[[113]](#cite_note-AoS601-113) Wanting to spare [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) the pain of loosing Fitz when there was the hope of finding another one, Simmons requested that Mackenzie not tell her alternate grandson about his death or their search. [[114]](#cite_note-AoS612-114) Before they left, Simmons and [Quake](/wiki/Quake) talked with [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) about her joining them, but she declined, saying that she needed to help Mackenzie. [[8]](#cite_note-AoS606-8) They then began their [mission](/wiki/Search_for_Leo_Fitz) through space to locate the [Chronicom Vessel](/wiki/Chronicom_Vessel) that was storing a frozen Fitz. This mission would go on for many months, causing many of the agents accompanying her to leave. However, despite all that they went through, Simmons never once doubted that they would find Fitz, although, it is believed that if she ever did, she would lose it. Eventually, all that would be left of the team was Simmons, Quake, [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) and [Piper](/wiki/Piper). During their time in space, Simmons decided to learn alien languages. Eventually they would come across the vessel, only to find it destroyed, having been cut in half. Still holding out hope, they continued their search, tracking down as many leads as they could come across to find the other half of the vessel. Using a manifest found on the vessel, they tracked down every supplier on it, going to [Trinawa](/wiki/Trinawa) and [Pyree](/wiki/Pyree), where they came to the conclusion that someone must have given out information of the whereabouts of the supposedly undetectable vessel. [[113]](#cite_note-AoS601-113) Interrogating Trok[ ] - \"We're [looking for someone](/wiki/Search_for_Leo_Fitz).\" \"Someone else to shake down or someone you want to eliminate?\" \"We just want to bring [him](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)home.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Trok](/wiki/Trok) [[src]](/wiki/Missing_Pieces) [One year later](/wiki/2019), the mission would eventually lead the team to [Trok](/wiki/Trok), who potentially had information about the whereabouts of [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), as he is known for selling traceable fuel, which could be why the vessel was attacked. On their way, they were chased down by the [Confederacy](/wiki/Confederacy) and had to do a forced landing on [D'Rill](/wiki/D%27Rill). When they were boarded, [Quake](/wiki/Quake) easily disarmed the enemies and defeated Trok. Simmons then came out and told him to give them what they wanted and he would live. Trok refused to tell them anything, so they decided to hang him upside down to get him to talk, as the different gravity on the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) would eventually kill him, as either his brain would haemorrhage or his lungs would collapse on themselves if left upside down too long. They explained how their journey lead them to numerous locations, eventually leading to him, and they questioned if he sold traceable fuel to the [Chronicom Vessel](/wiki/Chronicom_Vessel), but they discovered that he didn't, but actually bought the other half of the vessel. [[113]](#cite_note-AoS601-113) A New Clue[ ] - \" [It](/wiki/Naro-Atzia)'s a planet. Here. It must be where the [Chamber](/wiki/Cryo-Freeze_Chamber)was made, and that's where [Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)would go. And he was staring at it, he would've read it and headed there to... to find a way to freeze himself again.\" \"That's deep, deep space.\" \"No, I-I know how he thinks. That's where he'd go, and we have to follow.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) [[src]](/wiki/Missing_Pieces) Having learnt of the location of the other half of the [Chronicom Vessel](/wiki/Chronicom_Vessel), the team then headed to it, believing to have finally been successful in what they had set out to do. They boarded the damaged vessel and searched for the [Cryo-Freeze Chamber](/wiki/Cryo-Freeze_Chamber) that [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) was in. As they searched the vessel, Simmons learned that the vessel lost cabin pressure, but believed that Fitz should have survived it while in cryosleep. They then found the chamber, and Simmons opened it up. However, instead of being reunited with the love of her life, Simmons found it to be empty, devastating her. They then took the chamber onto the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) and thought about what they should do. Saddened about not finding Fitz, Simmons stood by the Chamber, as she continued to miss him. Simmons then decided to open the chamber and lay inside it, where she began to cry, only to become aware of a transcript inside the chamber that said where the chamber was made, [Naro-Atzia](/wiki/Naro-Atzia). This made her believe that Fitz would have gone to that planet, and she made her way to locate the planet. She then informed the rest of the team about the transcript and that they need to go to the planet to find Fitz. However, the team started to argue the idea, believing that should regroup back on [Earth](/wiki/Earth), as going further in space would not be smart. Simmons persisted as she did not want to let the trail go cold, but when she told [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) to set the coordinates, he refused. He told her that they may never be able to get back from that deep in space, and [Piper](/wiki/Piper) informed her that it would be more tactical if they returned. Simmons continued to convince them, but they made it clear that they were incredibly strained by the mission. The argument was interrupted when they were alerted of the [Confederacy](/wiki/Confederacy)'s presence, which they were confused on how they could have located them. They then shut down the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) so they would hopefully go undetected by the massive [ship](/wiki/Confederate_Destroyer_Ship) above them. They then watched as the ship flew over them, believing that they were safe from any detection, as they had not been destroyed yet. However, this was disproven when the destroyer ship opened fire on them. Simmons then turned the power back on and they attempted to escape the attack. [[113]](#cite_note-AoS601-113) To Deep-Deep Space[ ] As [Piper](/wiki/Piper) went to activate the [Phase Harmonic Teleportation Device](/wiki/Phase_Harmonic_Teleportation_Device), Simmons set the coordinates for [Naro-Atzia](/wiki/Naro-Atzia), despite [Quake](/wiki/Quake)'s order to head back to [Earth](/wiki/Earth). She then transported the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) through space, escaping the [Confederacy](/wiki/Confederacy)'s attack and making their way to the planet. [[113]](#cite_note-AoS601-113) They arrived at the planet momentarily, and Quake questioning her actions. However, Simmons assured her that [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) was there, unaware that he had actually just left when they arrived. [[115]](#cite_note-AoS602-115) Outraged by her reckless behaviour, Piper and [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) believed that they should lock her up for putting them at risk, but Simmons reminded them that their mission was to find Fitz. Quake confirmed that Fitz was the mission, but she addressed how she made the calls and her actions were too risky. She ordered that they attempt to head back home, but Simmons refused, threatening to stay behind to continue looking. However, they were interrupted when they received a greeting from [Pretorious Pryce](/wiki/Pretorious_Pryce), who informed them that as custom, they would be boarded for inspection. Quake tried to refuse the action, trying to head back to Earth, but they were forced to be boarded as they were written into the system, which could not be reversed. Simmons saw this as a chance to ask about Fitz's whereabouts, and they waited for the inspection of their ship to occur. Simmons, Quake and Piper met with Pryce, who instructed them to hand over their weapons. When he asked about their reason for visiting Naro-Atzia, Simmons told him they were looking for Fitz. When Simmons revealed this information, Pryce then got mad at her for saying that name, as it then alerted a [Chronicom Hunter](/wiki/Chronicom_Hunters), [Malachi](/wiki/Malachi) who was hunting Fitz. He came out from hiding and stunned Quake and Piper, but Simmons was able to evade the attack. When Pryce tried to stop the conflict, Simmons used him as a shield to maneuver to her gun, successfully reaching it. However, the fight was ended when Davis knocked out Malachi from behind. They then handcuffed him to the ship as Quake and Piper regained consciousness. They then started to question Malachi as to what he wanted with Fitz. He revealed that Fitz was wanted for tampering with the universe. They then discovered that Fitz was initially intended to arrive at Naro-Atzia, learning that he truly was alive and that they were close to finding him. Quake then went to ask Pryce if he knew anything about the vessel Fitz was on, as Malachi told Simmons that Fitz should not be alive, which Simmons explained that he should be with them, but Malachi revealed that he should be dead due to [him](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth) [dying a year ago](/wiki/Battle_of_Chicago). [[113]](#cite_note-AoS601-113) Ladies' - [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_on_the_Planet_of_Kitson) Simmons returned to the team, where they informed her that the ship [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) was on did arrive but turned around and headed to [Kitson](/wiki/Kitson). [Pretorious Pryce](/wiki/Pretorious_Pryce) then told the team about Kitson, describing the grotesque nature of the planet, believing that Fitz must be of perverted desire to visit there. However, despite Pryce's description of the planet, the team headed there in hopes to be reunited with Fitz. They arrived on the planet, where they came across [Boyle](/wiki/Boyle) and [Toad](/wiki/Toad), who [Quake](/wiki/Quake) forced to reveal that they had encountered Fitz, stealing his ship from him, as well as revealing that he was with [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) as well. As [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) handed them some [hallucinogens](/wiki/Puffies), mistaking them for food, Simmons asked about Fitz's whereabouts, which they revealed either the casino or the brothels. Simmons and Quake then proceeded to the casinos, as the effects of the hallucinogens started to kick in. Simmons joked that Fitz better be dead than in the brothels, and the two went to the counter and handed in their weapons. They then realized that they were both feeling odd, which Simmons believed to just be the different atmosphere. However, when they proceeded to enter, they started having the vision altered, causing them to not be able to walk properly. They made their way down some stairs, where they realized that it was the things they ate that were causing to feel strange. They eventually arrived at the bar, celebrating their achievement, but completely forgetting what they were doing, thinking that it was \"Ladies' Night\". The two then sat at the bar and started to reflect on their lives, talking about how Quake used to live in a [van](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson%27s_Van), which they all gave the nickname the \"Fartmobile,\" as well as Quake saying that she had a \"big nerd face\", asking if she went to [Hogwarts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogwarts) and if she knew any spells. As the two continued to be affected by the hallucinogens, Simmons suddenly then hallucinated a tiny Fitz in a monkey onesie dancing, which then triggered her memory as to why they were on Kitson. Remembering Fitz, Simmons then left Quake to go find him. However, Simmons was unsuccessful in locating the love of her life, and found herself laying under a table. Quake eventually found her, spotting her feet sticking out. She then joined her, where Simmons expressed her belief that her parents were mice. She then apologized to Quake for dragging them out through space in a so far unsuccessful attempt to find Fitz, saying that she just misses him so much. Quake then expressed her envy to have her own \"Fitz\", which Simmons recounted her unfortunate encounters with love, but told her that she was so proud of who she had become. The two then got really emotional and expressed love for one another, when suddenly they heard a sound that sounded like a dolphin. Shortly after, they then began to hear a piercing noise, which Simmons realized isn't from the hallucinogens, and must be coming from something. When they figured out that the noise was only perceptible to humans, and could be a signal, they believed that it must be to do with Fitz, meaning he was at the casino. They then went to find him, when they noticed some armed people enter that look similar to [Malachi](/wiki/Malachi). Quake went to defeat them with her powers, but was too disoriented to control them. Simmons then guided her arm for her and successfully knocked down one of the hunters. Quake then told Simmons to go find Fitz while she dealt with the enemies. [[116]](#cite_note-AoS603-116) Interrupted Reunion[ ] Still recovering from the hallucinogen, Simmons found herself bumping into a [guard](/wiki/Montalban_(House_of_Games)), where she told him that she needed to find her future [husband](/wiki/Leo_Fitz). Montalban pointed out how she was clearly under the affect of hallucinogens, revealing that she had been sitting under a table for twenty minutes. Simmons the started to question what she was doing, being filled with such disappointment and sadness for so long due to the constant dead ends she had encountered. Montalban told her that she should leave, as [Kitson](/wiki/Kitson) was no place for someone like her. She turned to leave, but the door behind Montalban suddenly blasted open, knocking him down. Simmons watched as a figure emerged from the door, which was revealed to be Fitz. Simmons became emotional, having finally found Fitz, while he was confused on her presence, believing her to be in the future. But before they could properly reunite, [Malachi](/wiki/Malachi) appeared and grabbed Fitz, quickly teleporting the two of them away. Shocked, Simmons remained frozen until Enoch came out, also confused. He then told her that she should not be on Kitson, as he too believed her to be in the future, unaware that the [Extinction-Level Event](/wiki/Destruction_of_Earth) had been prevented. [[116]](#cite_note-AoS603-116) After the missions failure, the team, joined by [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch), returned to the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) where they tried to get answers form the decommissioned [Chronicom](/wiki/Chronicoms). As Enoch felt sorry himself, Simmons and [Quake](/wiki/Quake) tried to figure out where Fitz would have been taken, having only one jump available due to [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) shooting the fuse box when he was high. When Fitz was mentioned, Enoch became more depressed, knowing that his only friend was gone. However, Simmons and Quake tried to comfort him, telling Enoch that they were his friends and that he sacrificed himself to stop the extinction-level event. Learning that the extinction-level event had been prevented, Enoch wondered why the Chronicoms were after him, as well as stating that they would never release Fitz, which Simmons objected by stating that she would never stop looking for him. [[117]](#cite_note-AoS605-117) Captured by the Chronicoms[ ] Suddenly, the power in the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) went out and the team went to check on what was happening. They then noticed a [Confederacy](/wiki/Confederacy) ship above them, causing them to try to retreat. However, they were stopped when a fleet of ships emerged, forcing the team to be boarded by the other ship. They quickly made their way to the where the enemies were about to enter, believing it to be the Confederacy and the [Remoraths](/wiki/Remorath). Simmons helped [Quake](/wiki/Quake) make some cover as they armed themselves. As they aimed at the door, believing the Remorath to be getting through with ease, [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) started to question the nature of the attack and believed it not to be the Confederacy, causing him to open the door. Another [Chronicom](/wiki/Atarah) then entered, who revealed that she knew Enoch and was there to bring him in for judgement for tampering with the universe. Enoch accepted this, and the team were taken captive by the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms), Simmons and Quake accompanying Enoch while [Piper](/wiki/Piper) and [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) were imprisoned. As they made their way through the ship, which they thought belonged to the Confederacy, which Atarah revealed that it used to. When Atarah was questioned by Enoch, she revealed that their [planet](/wiki/Chronyca-2) had been destroyed from what started as some reality distortions, followed by a plague, which they failed to act on. Simmons asked what caused the distortions, which they did not know. Atarah then revealed that the Confederacy came to them to take what they had left, but they fought back and took their ship from them. This then lead to them revealing their desire to go back in time and prevent their planet's destruction. Simmons and Quake then told Atarah that they didn't really know how they traveled through time, and that they did not want to help them, considering that they tried to kill them. Making it clear that they would not help them, Atarah then revealed Fitz being held at gunpoint by [Malachi](/wiki/Malachi) to convince them to help. When Simmons went to hug [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), she went through him, revealing that it was a hologram. When Malachi hit Fitz, Quake threatened to destroy the ship, which Atarah revealed that he is not on the ship, being aware of her power. After talking with Enoch, Atarah, growing tired of their refusal, returned and ordered Malachi to execute Fitz on her command. However, Simmons begged for her to spare him, revealing that it was a machine that controlled the [Monolith](/wiki/Monolith) that allowed them to travel through time. However, they did not know who created it or know of the designs, as well as it being destroyed in the future. Atarah then took these unhelpful answers as no reason to keep any of them alive, but Enoch interjected saying that if anyone could build a time machine, it would be Fitz. Simmons agreed but raised the point that if he could, he would have his whole life to do so and motivation to prevent the end of the world. Atarah then asked Enoch what could motivate Fitz, which he stated that if Simmons was to be put in danger, that could get Fitz to do anything. Atarah then took on this idea and ordered that Simmons and Fitz be kept alive, and the rest be killed. Knowing that they needed Fitz alive, Simmons told Quake this and she attacked the Chronicoms. The two then tried to escape, freeing Piper and Davis from their cell. As they made their way through the ship, they were surrounded by the Chronicoms, so Quake decided that they fight. [[117]](#cite_note-AoS605-117) Staying Behind[ ] - \" [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch)was right. [Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)can't solve [time travel](/wiki/Time_Travel)without me, but not as a hostage... as his partner. Fitz and I, we're a team. Let the others leave, and I'll go with you.\" - Jemma Simmons to [Atarah](/wiki/Atarah) [[src]](/wiki/The_Other_Thing) However, before the fight could begin, Simmons told the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) not to fire, realizing that even if they were to defeat all of them, they still wouldn't be able to escape the fleet of ships surrounding them. She then added that she would stay behind and help [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), not as a hostage, but as his partner. [Quake](/wiki/Quake) tried to convince Simmons not to stay, but she told her that this was the end of the road. She then thanked all of them for accompanying her on their mission, and told them that they can go home. Simmons then assured Quake that she'll be fine because she will be with Fitz. The Chronicoms then took her away and the team returned to [Earth](/wiki/Earth). [[117]](#cite_note-AoS605-117) Unstoppable[ ] Long Awaited Reunion[ ] Simmons was then put in a state of unconsciousness, as she and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) were then taken to the [Cerebral Fusion Machine](/wiki/Cerebral_Fusion_Machine) that allowed them to be put in a mental confine where they would share the same mind. When the machine was activated, Simmons awoke, unsure of where she was. She then looked over and saw Fitz and the two hugged, finally reuniting with one another after a year of being separated. They talked about what they had been doing to get to one another, which revealed to Fitz that she truly was sent forward in time. Suddenly, [Atarah](/wiki/Atarah) appeared and Simmons informed Fitz that she and the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) had been hunting them for the last year. She then told Fitz of who she is and about the destruction of their home planet [Chronyca-2](/wiki/Chronyca-2). When she revealed her intention to reverse the destruction, Fitz realized she was referring to [Time Travel](/wiki/Time_Travel), which he voiced was against the laws of physics, but Atarah told him that Simmons claimed it to be possible, having done it before. She then told them to begin working on finding a way to achieve time travel, informing them that they had access to any tool imaginable and that their minds and memories were shared within the machine. Simmons expressed concern for their memories being shared, but Atarah told her that it was necessary in order to achieve their goal. Atarah then warned them that there is no escape and that they should only be concerned on working on how to help them, and once that would be completed, they would be free. Atarah then suddenly exited, leaving the two to be alone, which then gave Fitz the chance to speak to Simmons. He held her hands and began to reflect on their relationship, noting everything they had overcome, including surviving the bottom of the ocean and crossing over the galaxy to find one another, making him to then believe that they are stronger than any curse, and they could not be stopped. Fitz then proposed to Simmons, which she said yes to, and the two passionately kissed. They then hugged, and Simmons expressed to Fitz that she didn't care if they ever escaped because she was with him. They then sat down, creating a spread of tea and sweets, and discussed their journey's to find each other and the planets they went to. Fitz then asked if she encountered any [Kree](/wiki/Kree), which she did in the future, something that she was not disclosing to Fitz, due to what happened to him in the other timeline. [[8]](#cite_note-AoS606-8) Age Regression[ ] [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) then began to discuss the future more, trying to understand what had happened when they traveled through time. He then created a [Time Di'Alla](/wiki/Time_Di%27Alla) and began to express some theories on how they could understand time travel. However, Simmons did not want to go into detail about her experiences with the future, as she did not want to ruin them finally being together by revealing his death. When Simmons got really annoyed at Fitz, who wouldn't stop with trying to understand what happened, she turned into the seven year old version of herself, shocking Fitz. She then hid underneath a bench and then went through a doorway that lead to her childhood bedroom. She then got into her bed as Fitz followed her, where he realized that they were in a prison of their own minds. Fitz, confused on what was happening, asked the young Simmons if she knew who he was, which she did, which led him to ask why she came to her room, which she revealed was where she would work out her problems. When she mentioned how she would put her troubles in her music box, Fitz went to inspect the box, but was stopped when Simmons asked him to read to her. When Fitz tried to get her out of the room, Simmons yelled out to her parents, forcing him to comply with the request. When Fitz began reading the box, which was about Simmons' journey to find him, he discovered that it was the [Darkhold](/wiki/Darkhold), causing him to throw away the book. Fitz then grabbed Simmons and brought her back to the space they were working in. When they entered, they saw Atarah standing in front of them, who Fitz questioned for putting them in a mind prison. When Simmons expressed that she didn't like being there, Atarah told her to do what she asked, which Fitz interjected due to her being seven years old. Simmons then noticed the work bench that contained a collection of chemicals and equipment. She then ran over to it and began mixing the chemicals to make [Mononitrotoluene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mononitrotoluene) to use to escape, which Fitz, who was getting frustrated, made her hand it over. The two began to argue until Fitz started to mention creating [Aida](/wiki/Aida) to help him, which made Simmons return to her normal age, as Fitz planned. [[8]](#cite_note-AoS606-8) Memories and Fears[ ] - \"Daddy taught me to put my troubles away in a little box so they wouldn't keep me up at night. Bad feelings - anger, fear, pain - I would just put them inside the little box, and they would stay in there, nice and neat and crushed.\" \"You need therapy. You have some deep, deep, pent-up issues.\" \"It's been a rough year!\" - Jemma Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) [[src]](/wiki/Inescapable) As the two argued due to the built up frustration of being trapped in the machine, [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) asked Simmons what she was so afraid of, which resulted in the memory of [Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth)'s death to conjure with [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) appearing. The two then visited Simmons' memory, despite Simmons not wanting Fitz to see it, as he discovered a [body bag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/body_bag) that had his dead body inside it. She told him that she was going to tell him that he did make it to the future and back, and broke the loop by sacrificing himself. Fitz then witnessed Johnson hand Simmons a ring, which made him realize that he had proposed to Simmons already and they had gotten married. This all then caused Fitz to become overwhelmed, which Simmons tried to comfort him, but he then discovered that [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) had died too. Being too much to take in at once, Fitz then left to process everything. Simmons, still in her memory, went to find Fitz in the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse), where she came across [Quake](/wiki/Quake) and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) who were talking before the mission to find Fitz. Simmons then heard marching echo through the base, which she later discarded to try and remember why she was remembering the conversation. She then realized that Fitz was pushing himself too hard because of all the stress, which had resulted in [The Doctor](/wiki/The_Doctor) persona coming out before. She then continued to find search for Fitz, which lead to the two entering the memory of them beginning to work together. Fitz then questioned whose memory they were in, which Simmons believed it to be a shared memory. Simmons then remembered what she needed to worry about, mentioning Fitz's mental problems, noticing him getting stressed about escaping the prison, which made Simmons realize that The Doctor persona was present within the prison too. As Fitz continued to be mentally overwhelmed, with the addition of learning about the other timeline, Simmons tried to calm him down, worried that he would crack. She then told him that she knew he had been hearing The Doctor in his head, revealing a psychic split he had. Simmons told him that The Doctor had stayed with him since the [Framework](/wiki/Framework) and that he was in his mind, along with them. They then heard marching echo. They then left to try and hide from The Doctor, but they were found by him. The Doctor then order his men to open fire on them, causing them to run away, entering Simmons' childhood room again. Simmons then started to have a panic attack, which started to cause her music box to shake. This breakdown, in fact, caused Simmons' pent-up problems to be unleashed from the box, taking the form of a demonic version of Simmons. [Id Simmons](/wiki/Id_Simmons) then attacked Fitz, and Simmons hit her with a pillow, telling her to get back in her box. The two then hid in the closet, where they discussed the personification of Simmons' issues trying to kill them. They then fell backwards, ending up in the control room of the Lighthouse, where they further discussed their fears that were after them. They then entered their memory of them first meeting Coulson and being recruited for his team. Simmons noted that she found him very inspiring that day and that Fitz needed a push to get on board with it. Suddenly, the two found themselves separated, causing Simmons to go looking for him. She then heard his voice and followed it until she saw that it was actually the Doctor who had trapped her and escorted her to the [Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine](/wiki/Theta_Brain-Wave_Frequency_Machine). Simmons was then strapped into the machine, where she began to taunt The Doctor about being manipulated his whole life. The Doctor, taking his revenge, told Simmons he was going to take away some of her memories. The Doctor then activated the machine and began to torture Simmons. Despite the excruciating pain she was going through, Simmons knew that she was not doing it alone, as she was connected with Fitz. They then realized that they were also able to summon their friends to save them, so Simmons summoned [Quake](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson/Cerebral_Fusion_Machine) who knocked out all the enemies and freed her. Quake then fought off the remaining enemies and told Simmons to get out of there. She ran from The Doctor and hid inside a [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module) at the same time Fitz entered, running from Id Simmons. The two then get mad at each other for the other's evil side torturing them. They continued to fight about the other has hurt them, Fitz bringing up her leaving after his brain damage and falling in love with [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels), and Simmons mentioned Aida and the Framework. The argument continued, each talking about the other's problems, which lead to them talking about how the other saves them, which Simmons mentioned how they were trapped at the bottom of the ocean. This then caused the Containment Module to be filled with water. The fighting then turned into passion for one another, making them question why they were still yelling. At that moment, the water stopped, and the two took a moment due to being exhausted. Fitz stated that they would have to face their evil personifications and that they may die trying. Simmons then called back to the fact that they are unstoppable together and the two held hands as they prepared to fight. However, when the exited, they discovered The Doctor and Id Simmons making out, surprising them, especially as they began intercourse, allowing them to learn about the other's interest and capability in that area. [[8]](#cite_note-AoS606-8) Escape[ ] - \" [Time Travel](/wiki/Time_Travel)is nasty business... and I don't know if I want any part of it.\" \"So if we have to spend the rest of our lives in this prison together, then so be it.\" - [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Inescapable) They then returned to the room they started in, where Simmons made the conclusion that they were made for each other and apologized for him missing out on what happened in the timeline, saying that all she can give him was her. She then gave him his ring, when [Atarah](/wiki/Atarah) appeared again, informing them it had been five minutes and thirty-three seconds since they started. She told them to get back to work, but Fitz told her that he would not help her, and Simmons stated that they would stay imprisoned if that's what it meant. However, Atarah told them that they wouldn't be together, but she was interrupted when she began to malfunction, letting out a piercing sound before collapsing. They then awoke from the [Cerebral Fusion Machine](/wiki/Cerebral_Fusion_Machine) to find [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) standing above all of the defeated [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms), having freed them from their imprisonment. Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) then quickly embraced each other while Enoch activated the [Inter-Planetary Conveyance Disc](/wiki/Inter-Planetary_Conveyance_Disc) he obtained from [Malachi](/wiki/Malachi). Enoch then told them to embrace him so that they would all fit on the device. As they were about to leave, Simmons informed Fitz that he is also a grandfather, leaving him confused as they successfully left the ship. [[8]](#cite_note-AoS606-8) Stranded on Kitson[ ] - \"We just want to go [home](/wiki/Earth). Surely a decent soul like you can understand. Somebody who's so proud of his own [home](/wiki/Kitson).\" - Jemma Simmons to [Mister Kitson](/wiki/Mister_Kitson) [[src]](/wiki/Toldja) Due to [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch)'s inexperience using the [Inter-Planetary Conveyance Disc](/wiki/Inter-Planetary_Conveyance_Disc), they were brought back to [Kitson](/wiki/Kitson), the last destination of the device, where they were still wanted due to their recent visit on the planet. When Enoch went to retrieve the device to reprogram it, they discovered someone had picked up the device and activated it, teleporting away, stranding them. As [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) got angry at Enoch, Simmons expressed to herself that she wanted to go [home](/wiki/Earth). They then decided to lay low in the casino and waited for the exit to be clear for them to leave. They stood at a game table and acted as enthused observers, something that Simmons was not convincing in. Simmons then reflected on her last time at Kitson, noting that being there was worse without the [hallucinogens](/wiki/Puffies) she ingested, providing her with a memorable experience. Enoch then noticed that the exit was clear so they made their way to the door, but were ultimately stopped when [Montalban](/wiki/Montalban_(House_of_Games)) who became aware of their presence, surrounding them with guards, informing them that [Mister Kitson](/wiki/Mister_Kitson) was expecting them. They then locked them up and brought them to the ruler of Kitson's office. As they stood in his office, Fitz began to mock Mister Kitson to Simmons, noting the picture he had on the wall. Mister Kitson then entered the room and began to tell the three about his family's history on how they built Kitson which had become his empire, something that they had put at risk by bringing in Enoch, followed by [bounty hunters](/wiki/Chronicom_Hunters). Simmons and Fitz began to plead to Mister Kitson, Simmons calling him a decent soul in hopes to appeal to his pride in his home. However, he informed them that he will only deal out punishments for them. Fitz told him that they could work for him instead of being killed, explaining their many skills, Simmons being a botanist, chemist and able to speak alien languages. However, Mister Kitson made it clear that killing them is the only use he has for them, as well as sending Enoch to the brothels. Mister Kitson then decided to make a game out of their demised, setting Simmons and Fitz, along with [Wayne](/wiki/Wayne) on a guillotine. Simmons expressed her being underwhelmed in their nearing death, considering all they've been through, and that no one would believe it, something Fitz admitted he would. Mister Kitson then announced the game, three people holding the weight of the blade until one cannot hold it no more and is decapitated. The blades were then released and they all held onto the chain, desperately trying to keep the blade from falling. As they all keep the blade from falling, Wayne began to hit on Simmons, which made Fitz yell at him, causing his blade to slip. [[118]](#cite_note-AoS607-118) Recruited by Izel[ ] The game was ended when [Wayne](/wiki/Wayne), who was sabotaged by [Mister Kitson](/wiki/Mister_Kitson), was decapitated, due to [Izel](/wiki/Izel) interfering. Izel, having paid Mister Kitson to spare them, stood in front of them and offered them a drink. Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) convinced Izel to also purchase [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch), and they all sat in the bar and thanked her for saving them. Izel then informed them that Simmons and Fitz were now a part of her crew, as she was on [Kitson](/wiki/Kitson) to recruit those with nothing to lose. Izel then told them that she needed their expertise to help locate artefacts stolen from her. They initially believed themselves not to be of any help, but Izel revealed that the planet she was going to was [Earth](/wiki/Earth). They then immediately agreed to help her, but she told them she didn't have a ship. However, Fitz informed her that he knew of a [ship](/wiki/Lazy_Comet) they could use, the one he and Enoch arrived on Kitson with that was stolen from them. They then made their way to the ship where they encountered [Boyle](/wiki/Boyle) and [Toad](/wiki/Toad), who immediately gave up the ship, due to what happened last time they encountered them. Izel also asked for the crew occupying the ship to accompany them. With everything coming together, Simmons and Fitz became relieved and celebrated in the fact that they were heading home. They then noticed Enoch leaving, so they stopped him, asking what he was doing. He revealed that due to the extinction-level event being prevented and Simmons and Fitz on their way home, his mission was complete. He then informed them of his new mission, to help find a home for the Chronicoms. Annoyed that he wasn't going to say goodbye, Enoch informed them that he wanted to spare them emotional farewell, having grown fond of them. Simmons then thanked Enoch for everything he did for them, and Fitz hugged his friend. He then handed them a contact device for them to call him. [[118]](#cite_note-AoS607-118) [Izel's Campaign](/wiki/Izel%27s_Campaign)[ ] Heading Home[ ] They then started travelling through space as Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) began working on the [jump drive](/wiki/Phase_Harmonic_Teleportation_Device) to prepare the ship for a hyper jump. When [Boyle](/wiki/Boyle) and [Toad](/wiki/Toad) expressed their concerns, Fitz stated that the odds are even in surviving the jump. However, Simmons mentioned to him that the odds are not good, something that Fitz commented they were never, but they had to hope for the best. Simmons expressed that she would be fine being stuck with him forever, but she was growing tired of space. They then completed working on the jump drive and Simmons told [Izel](/wiki/Izel) to activate it. Once she did, they moved to the window to see if they were successful, for which they were greeted by the sight of Earth. As they made their way to the planet, Simmons and Fitz started to work on the ship's communication so they could contact [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.). When Izel came to check on them, she expressed her envy to have a home, which Simmons told her that they would help her with her mission to retrieve the artefacts. Simmons then asked about the artefacts she was looking for, which was revealed to be the [Monoliths](/wiki/Monolith), something they were familiar with. Simmons, aware that they had been destroyed, said that she thought that they were kept on [Chronyca-2](/wiki/Chronyca-2), which Izel said she went to, but it was destroyed and that's where her crew were killed. She then revealed the nature of the Monoliths as well as [someone](/wiki/Sarge) who was intent on eliminating her, because she knew of his true nature. Later, Boyle came up to them, holding [Puffies](/wiki/Puffies), telling them that he could not find Toad, believing something to be wrong. Simmons did not want to be near the Puffies due to her previous encounter with them, and Fitz told him to leave as they were busy. Fitz asked about her experience with the Puffies, which she told him that it made her see him in a monkey suit. When Fitz said she was being cagey when Izel asked about the Monoliths, Simmons revealed that there were three Monoliths destroyed on at the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). She told him that the destruction did provide them with a wedding venue, which began Fitz to be upset about existing, getting married and dying in another timeline, which Simmons found ridiculous. Simmons then continued to work on sending a message when he began to talk about the wedding night. As they entered Earth's atmosphere, Fitz came to the conclusion that communication could not be achieved to or from the ship. When Fitz asked if Izel gave her the coordinates of where they were landing, Simmons told him no, wondering where she disappeared to. Simmons then asked Boyle if Izel had told him or his crew anything, but he did not respond, which Simmons found strange. When the ship began to land, Simmons noticed the disappearance of the entire crew. [[119]](#cite_note-AoS608-119) Simmons then noted that they were five minutes out and then asked for an update on the coms, which Fitz was having no success at. Simmons then encouraged him to continue, thinking they would have better luck when they got closer. As she spoke to Fitz, she saw some of the crew return, but suspected something unusual about them, believing it could be an alien parasite. They decided that whatever was causing the odd behaviour could not be spread on Earth and should determine the cause before they land. Simmons then spotted Izel enter, concluding that she was the cause. [[120]](#cite_note-AoS609-120) Izel's True Nature[ ] When she approached them for an update, Simmons addressed the crew's behaviour, which [Izel](/wiki/Izel) revealed to them that she infected them for a higher purpose. Izel then assured them that they were safe as they are of great value to her, not being able to come across intelligent people in the galaxy. Now becoming concerned, the two continued working on the comms as Izel sensed her tower on the surface be destroyed. She asked if they knew about this, but they explained to her that they have no idea what is going on, but have friends that could help them. She then ordered that they get the comms working as she told [Boyle](/wiki/Boyle) to get the ship into the upper atmosphere. As they worked, fearing their lives, the two talked amongst themselves about the situation until [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) brought up the distress code, which Simmons revealed hadn't been changed, giving them the idea to send it out to [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.). Izel then demanded to know when they were finished, which they revealed they had fixed it, tuning into the S.H.I.E.L.D. communication channel. Simmons then spoke the code, which was picked up by [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) onboard the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), who also used the code, which Simmons initially was confused by, not being aware of the ship being hijacked. Davis then asked if they were in the ship in the upper atmosphere, which she confirmed, both trying to act normally to not alert either of the threats on the two ships. However, the [threat](/wiki/Sarge) on the Zephyr One revealed himself, which Simmons identified as sounding exactly like [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson), and called out Izel. The two began to speak to each other as Simmons and Fitz became confused on who was on the channel, knowing that Coulson was dead. Izel then ended the communication and asked them how they knew Sarge, believing that they were conspiring against her, but they revealed that he sounded like someone they knew. However, Izel did not believe them and ordered her crew to take them, but Simmons and Fitz were able to disarm them and pull their guns on them. They then ran away from them, but were soon cornered until Fitz came up with an idea that he believed Simmons wouldn't like. The two then hid in a container, where Fitz commented on how Simmons smelt nice. [[120]](#cite_note-AoS609-120) [Rescued from the Lazy Comet](/wiki/Infiltration_into_the_Lazy_Comet)[ ] - \"That sounds like [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)\" \"Never been so happy to hear live ammunition.\" - [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Collision_Course_Part_Two) While they were hiding, they heard gunfire which sounded like what was used by [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.), causing them to be relived in knowing they were being rescued. However, at that moment, they were found by [Boyle](/wiki/Boyle) and [Toad](/wiki/Toad) who grabbed them and threw them to the ground. Suddenly, they disappeared and were found chained to the pipes, which turned out to be because of [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) using her powers. They then saw Rodriguez and [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) enter and they all hugged, finally being reunited with each other after so long. They then made their way back to the [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) that was docked on the ship. As they headed back, Rodriguez asked about the number of crew members infected, which [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) revealed it was all of them. They then came across [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis) and [Jaco](/wiki/Jaco), who both Simmons and Fitz asked each other about, not knowing who he was. They then discovered that the Quinjet had been filled with the crew, causing them to not have a way out. But Jaco then revealed that he did, leading them into the airlock where he placed his jacket on the wall and activated the portal that was on it. Simmons then expressed that she liked him, which Jaco responded that he was likeable. They all then went through the portal and arrived on top of [Sarge's Truck](/wiki/Sarge%27s_Truck) and entered it where they saw [Quake](/wiki/Quake), [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw), they all then hugged, while Fitz became confused about who Shaw was. They then noticed Jaco holding the [Atom Bomb](/wiki/Atom_Bomb) as he activated the portal again, telling them to inform Sarge he completed the [mission](/wiki/Sarge%27s_Campaign). He then went through the portal and destroyed the Lazy Comet, along with all the infected crew. [[120]](#cite_note-AoS609-120) Celebration[ ] They all then returned to the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse) where a celebration was held for the victory over the [Shrike](/wiki/Shrike) as well as the return of [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz). Simmons sat down and watched as Fitz attempted to play darts while [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) spoke with him, expressing his happiness to have him back, despite this Fitz never meeting Shaw. Shaw went on to discuss how he was right about his [Multiverse](/wiki/Multiverse) theory and showed him [his company](/wiki/Deke_Shaw%27s_Company). When Fitz addressed to Simmons that Shaw continues to call him \"Bobo\", which Simmons informed him was what [his alternate self](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Bobo) wanted Shaw to call him. Shaw then brought up [Scotland](/wiki/Scotland), wanting to know everything about his family heritage, adding on that he could even buy them a castle. Shaw then left to introduce them to [Snowflake](/wiki/Snowflake) and Simmons handed Fitz her drink to help him through listening to Shaw. The two then sat down together as [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) made a toast. He acknowledged the journey they have all been on, acknowledging all the agents old, new, gone and even returned, and how they have stood by [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) at all times. He stated that without all of them, there was no S.H.I.E.L.D.. They all then raised their drinks to Mackenzie and drank. As they party died down and everyone else went and did their own thing, Simmons and Fitz stayed sitting on the couch talking to each other, finally home together after being away for so long. [[120]](#cite_note-AoS609-120) Learning about Sarge[ ] When [Sarge](/wiki/Sarge) was shot in his cell, they all rushed down, Simmons bringing a medical bag. When the arrived, Simmons was astounded by the resemblance Sarge had with [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson), which [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) reminded her that it wasn't Coulson but to still try and save him. Simmons then followed where Sarge's body was being taken, assuring Mackenzie that she was keep him updated. As Simmons inspected the body in the medical bay, she asked for [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) to bring her bags of blood, as she had discovered that he still had a pulse. When Fitz brought the blood, Simmons informed him of her discovery, where she revealed to him that he was actually getting stronger, as opposed to dying from the wounds. Simmons continued to watch over Sarge, checking his pupils. Simmons then moved Sarge's body to the morgue for safety, and had Mackenzie come see her discovery. When he arrived, she showed him Sarge's pulse and revealed that all his wounds had disappeared. Both confused on what any of it meant, Simmons informed Mackenzie that she and Fitz were working on it. When Mackenzie suggested stationing a guard to be with Simmons, she objected as she believed not many people should know. However, he overruled her as he knew how dangerous Sarge was, and didn't want her to be alone with him. As Simmons continued to watch Sarge, he suddenly awoke. Simmons then greeted him and informed him that he was shot by [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May), who was possessed by Izel at the time. Sarge then tried to tell Simmons the danger they were in, demanding foe her to free him, but she refused. She then went back to her work when they received a call from May who reported that Mackenzie was currently extremely dangerous and to watch out for him, as he was possessed by [Izel](/wiki/Izel). Suddenly, Sarge became free of his restraints and attacked Simmons and the other agent, knocking them out. They later regained consciousness, and Simmons noticed that Sarge was gone. Sarge was brought back into custody, after his failed encounter with Izel, who had [infiltrated the Lighthouse](/wiki/Infiltration_into_the_Lighthouse) and escaped with Containment Device](/wiki/Gravity_Containment_Device). [[121]](#cite_note-AoS610-121) Simmons, Fitz and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) began working on a way to prevent Izel from possessing any of them, something that previously resulted in the death of [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis). When [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) came to check on their progress, they informed her that they hadn't made any, only knowing that Izel is able to take control of the host's body, rendering them in a state of unconsciousness. Johnson then privately asked Simmons about Sarge, who everyone else assumed was dead not too long ago. Simmons informed her that she didn't know entirely what to do when discovering him healing, but after watching footage of Sarge talking to Izel, revealing that he is inhabiting Coulson's body. Simmons then showed Johnson live footage of May talking with Sarge, pointing out the equipment she has filled the room with and the scans she was conducted to try and understand what is inside Sarge. Johnson then noticed Simmons was not telling her something, which she revealed to he to be that May was holding onto the part of the footage where Izel revealed that Sarge's memories were Coulson's and that she believes he is starting to remember all of them. This then caused concern between the two, as they knew that he was not Coulson. [[122]](#cite_note-AoS611-122) Daisy Johnson's Behavior[ ] - \"You have a pattern. It happened after you [got your powers](/wiki/Terrigenesis). After [Lincoln](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell), you walked away.\" \"That has nothing to do with it.\" \"Everything around here reminded you of [Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson), so you [left](/wiki/Search_for_Leo_Fitz). You didn't want to face it.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) [[src]](/wiki/From_the_Ashes) While they weren't able to get any progress on [Izel](/wiki/Izel)'s body hoping abilities, they began working on potential weapons to defeat her, analyzing the [Shrike](/wiki/Shrike) knives and [Sarge's Sword](/wiki/Sarge%27s_Sword). They were able to learn that they have a familiar crystalline structure, like the [Monoliths](/wiki/Monolith), which could then be reverse engineered to create more weapons. When [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) returned to the lab, they informed her of their discovery, however, she noted that it wouldn't matter if they couldn't get in striking distance of Izel. She continued by saying that if Izel possessed any of the team, she wouldn't stab them, so they needed to figure out a way to stop that. As Johnson became frustrated due to them making no progress with Sarge, Simmons called her out for not wanting to listen to what he has to say. Simmons then addressed a pattern Johnson displays after traumatic events, causing her to run away from them: getting her abilities, [Lincoln Campbell](/wiki/Lincoln_Campbell)'s death, [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)'s death, and now [Sarge](/wiki/Sarge). However, Johnson tried to tell her that she was fine, but Simmons understood that she was just keeping her problems built up. Simmons then assured Johnson that they are all there for her. Simmons later checked the monitor to see that Johnson had snapped Sarge's neck, so she communicated to her through the speaker, asking what she had done. Johnson told her that she faced her problems, but Simmons did not intend for that to involve murder. Johnson admitted that Simmons was right when she confronted her, and revealed that she read a letter Coulson wrote to her, making her understand that Sarge was not Coulson. They then checked the scanners on Sarge's body, showing that he was again getting stronger, revealing he was alive. They continued to watch as Sarge got back up and attacked Johnson. Johnson then returned to the lab, where Simmons informed them that they were locking down the sectors, however Johnson was focused on if they recorded what happened. They then watched has she grabbed the sword, saying that she would either get Sarge to talk or she would see if it could kill him. Simmons suggested that there was a chance at saving Coulson, but Johnson refused, stating that he died a year ago. She the pursued Sarge in the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). [[122]](#cite_note-AoS611-122) Stopping Izel[ ] Simmons, [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) continued to work in the lab, struggling to come up with ideas on how to defeat [Izel](/wiki/Izel). As Simmons and Fitz bounced ideas off each other, Shaw stopped them as he listened back to [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)'s recent encounter with [Sarge](/wiki/Sarge) until he came across when Sarge mentioned sounds. This gave him the idea of resident frequencies being made off the weapons, realizing that's how Izel's powers work. They were then able to come to the conclusion that Izel was aligning her atoms through harmonic residence, which they would need to disrupt, like the [Shrike](/wiki/Shrike) knives did. They finally were successful and began working on the designs for a device that would reverberate audible frequencies throughout their bodies that match the frequency of the knives, creating a sonic barrier. [[122]](#cite_note-AoS611-122) When [Marcus Benson](/wiki/Marcus_Benson) gave the coordinates to the [Temple of the Forgotten](/wiki/Temple_of_the_Forgotten), Johnson detailed the mission to stop Izel and rescue [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez). When [Piper](/wiki/Piper) addressed not being able to get near Izel, Simmons and Fitz informed them that they had successfully created [Sonic Barrier Cuffs](/wiki/Sonic_Barrier_Cuffs) to stop Izel from possessing them. When asked how many they had, Shaw revealed that he had manufactured ten, which took everyone by surprise. Simmons and Fitz then went on to reveal that they had melted down Sarge's [daggers](/wiki/Shrike_Daggers) to make into [bullets](/wiki/Shrike_Bullets) to kill the Shrike. Although, there was still some uncertainty towards knowing if any of it will defeat Izel. A team then went to the coordinates and Simmons and Fitz monitored the mission in the control room. When they arrived, Piper called in to Simmons to inform them they found the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), and Simmons informed them they had satellites coming in to guide them. However, Sarge expressed against that idea, believing that Izel could hear their communication. They then decided to go dark for the rest of the mission. As they waited at the base, Simmons expressed concern for how they will get the cuffs to Mackenzie and Rodriguez without encountering Izel, so she and Fitz began thinking of ideas. Suddenly, Shaw spoke up about a way to get past Izel, which they were all for. However, Shaw was hesitant in revealing it as he didn't want them to get mad as it was already in the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). Shaw then led them through the Lighthouse, asking them to remember how excited they were when he produced the cuffs, as he made his way to a room. Shaw then revealed that his company was stationed inside that room, still operating and were responsible for the creation of the cuffs. [Kaya](/wiki/Kaya) then presented to them the [ShawDrive](/wiki/ShawDrive), which Simmons recognized as a [Jump Drive](/wiki/Phase_Harmonic_Teleportation_Device), causing her and Fitz to realize that he had stole all the ideas for his creations, including the [Framework](/wiki/Framework). Simmons then brought up the fact that an agent could use the Jump Drive to teleport into the field. They all then decided to work on the Jump Drive so they could make a distraction for the team. As they worked on the Jump Drive, [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) called in to inform them that their cover was blown. Simmons told her that they may have a solve to help them get to Mackenzie and Rodriguez, however, Fitz was doubtful they would get it to work. Fitz and Shaw then began to argue, which caused Simmons to stop them, getting angry at the repetitive conflict between the two due to the exhaustion of it all, as she has already experienced it before. She then reminded them of what they were doing, and got them back to work. However, this didn't prove to last as Fitz continued to get annoyed at Shaw for stealing tech to make a profit with his company. This then caused Shaw to open up about why he started his company, as no one liked him. Shaw then confronted Simmons for telling him about Fitz dying, which she said she did to spare him the pain. Shaw then decided to take action to get some respect for himself, by grabbing some of the cuffs and putting on the Jump Drive, and teleporting out of the Lighthouse, which proved that it worked successfully. Moments later, they received contact with Shaw, who revealed that the Jump Drive wasn't working, which they revealed was because it needed to build up charge. As Shaw waited for the charge in the temple, he expressed an idea for a game about killing zombies, which Simmons supported, not mentioned the already existing examples of the very idea. Suddenly, Shaw heard Izel, so he made his way to where the noise was coming from, placing a camera so everyone at the Lighthouse could see. Simmons then watched as Izel stood before the [Monoliths](/wiki/Monolith), not sure what was happening, fearing that they were too late. Shaw then stated that he wanted to get out of the temple, but Simmons informed him he didn't have enough power to get back to the Lighthouse. However, when Shaw became overwhelmed by Izel's army, he teleported anyway, appearing in the jungle, still being chased by the army. Simmons told him to head to the [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) as it was close to his location. Shaw made it there safe, and then asked for further instructions, but he was told just to wait for an extract. They then looked at the screen, watching Sarge and May approach Izel. [[114]](#cite_note-AoS612-114) [War Against the Chronicoms](/wiki/War_Against_the_Chronicoms)[ ] [Ambush at the Lighthouse](/wiki/Ambush_at_the_Lighthouse)[ ] They were all soon shocked when they watched [Sarge](/wiki/Sarge) stab [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) in the stomach and pushed her through the portal that [Izel](/wiki/Izel) had opened. As Simmons sought comfort in [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) over her friend's apparent death, [Quake](/wiki/Quake) called in to alert them that they were trapped in the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) as it had been breached by Izel's army. They informed her that Sarge had stabbed May, but the comms suddenly went offline and they were mysteriously locked out of the system, followed by the satellites going offline too. This was revealed to be due to the [Chronicom Hunters](/wiki/Chronicom_Hunters), who ambushed [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) in the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). Simmons saw the Hunters assault the control room, causing her to flee with Fitz, trying to hide from the attackers, who sought to kill them all. As they helped other agents escape, Simmons and Fitz decided to follow S.H.I.E.L.D. emergencies protocols, thinking that [Trevor Khan](/wiki/Trevor_Khan)'s [STRIKE](/wiki/STRIKE) team would be waiting for them below. However, Fitz also decided to use the contact device [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) gave them to call for backup. Unfortunately, there was no response, leading them to believe he had already been eliminated by the Hunters. They made their way to the designated floor for the protocol, but they came across the STRIKE team murdered by the Hunters. They wondered how the Hunters could known about the floor, as it was unused and only addressed verbally. This led Fitz to realize that it was because the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) had been inside their minds using the [Cerebral Fusion Machine](/wiki/Cerebral_Fusion_Machine) to learn everything they knew about S.H.I.E.L.D. and how to ambush it. They then were joined by [Diaz](/wiki/Diaz_(Agent)), and they discussed where they could go. Understanding that the Hunters knew everything they did, they decided to get the agents to [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw)'s development lab, having only recently learnt of its existence. Simmons and Fitz stayed behind, knowing they were a liability, causing Simmons to decide to make sure the Hunters don't get inside anyone else's minds. They made their way to where all their research and data was stored, including what was left of the Framework. They realized that the Hunters would want brain scans of those who went in, including [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson), which would give them all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secrets, which was why they had to blow it up. When the checked outside the room, they saw the Hunters gathering mind tech, such as the [Theta Brain-Wave Frequency Machine](/wiki/Theta_Brain-Wave_Frequency_Machine), causing them to proceed to plant explosives inside the room so the Hunters would not get what they want. They then started to discuss the plan, which wasn't looking good for them, understanding they didn't have enough ammunition, there was only one entrance, and that there was no timer for the explosives. However, Simmons took out a grenade to use as a trigger for the explosives, as they had realized they would have to be in the blast to stop the Hunters. When the Hunters breached the room, Simmons pulled the pin and they two sat together before setting it off. However, when they were discovered by two Hunters, they were saved when someone shot the threats. The Chronicom that saved their lives, put the pin back in the grenade and was revealed to be Enoch. He told them that he had stole another Chornicom's skin in order to infiltrate the Hunters. He then informed them that there were more Hunters coming, which Simmons knew they wouldn't be able to fight off. Enoch then began to propose a strategy to save their lives, for which they had to act quickly for. Enoch then expressed that it would be the hardest thing that have done: changing the natural course of their lives forever, something that they were familiar with many times. [[123]](#cite_note-AoS613-123) Using a [Inter-Planetary Conveyance Disc](/wiki/Inter-Planetary_Conveyance_Disc), Enoch transported Simmons and Fitz onto a [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) that [Piper](/wiki/Piper) was piloting back [Flint](/wiki/Flint/Monolith_Recreation) to the Lighthouse, and they told her to head to the [Temple of the Forgotten](/wiki/Temple_of_the_Forgotten), as they had bigger problems than Izel. Once they landed, Flint constructed a piece of the [Time Di'Alla](/wiki/Time_Di%27Alla) for them, and they told Piper and Flint to wait there, as the three rushed to the Zephyr and teleported through space to the [Theta Serpentis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_Serpentis) constellation, where they could safely work to stop the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms). Fitz immediately began studying the [Time Stream](/wiki/Time_Stream) that Enoch had stolen, despite Simmons' worries of it driving him mad or giving him radiation poisoning, as they had no other choice. Once Fitz looked through numerous different timelines of possibilities, the three began working on a plan that would best stop the Chronicoms', which resulted in being [Time Travel](/wiki/Time_Travel). They then began working on building the means of doing so, while also creating an [implant](/wiki/D.I.A.N.A.) for Simmons to wipe her memory of Fitz's location, when she returned to the team. [[124]](#cite_note-AoS713-124) Living a Life[ ] Simmons focused on studying her own brain, running multiple simulations for the [implant](/wiki/D.I.A.N.A.) with [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch), while [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) built the time machine. One day, Fitz jokingly expressed jealousy over Simmons and Enoch spending so much time together, as well as informing them that he was having some trouble with his task, requiring better materials. Simmons determined that with their current rate of progress, they could return to the [Temple of the Forgotten](/wiki/Temple_of_the_Forgotten), pick up their team and begin their mission in no time. However, due to recently finding out Simmons was pregnant, Fitz suggested that they should take some time to just live a life, and Simmons agreed. [[125]](#cite_note-AoS711-125) Transforming [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) into a more appropriate home, Simmons and Fitz, along with Enoch, began to live out a life together, as they stayed hidden in space from the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms), despite knowing that not only their friends, but the entire world needed them. Eventually, Simmons gave birth to her daughter, which she and Fitz decided to name [Alya](/wiki/Alya_Fitz), after the star that they were living near, which was also Simmons' favourite. Over the next four years, the family would live together happily, with Simmons and Fitz passing down their love of scientific curiosity to their daughter, as they would watched all the stars outside from the cockpit. However, by [2023](/wiki/2023), Simmons and Fitz decided that they had to go back in time to return to the mission they so desperately had been putting off. However, because they now had a daughter, Fitz altered the implant to Simmons would forget Alya, along with Fitz's location, to make it easier for her. But, Simmons didn't want to forget her own daughter, not wanting to deal with the pain. Fitz was able to convince Simmons to go along with it, despite the feeling of guilt she would have over it, and they prepared to proceed with their mission [[124]](#cite_note-AoS713-124) One Last Mission[ ] - \"The [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms)want to establish Chronyca-3 as their new home planet here, on [Earth](/wiki/Earth). They believe only [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)can stop them, so they sent [Hunters](/wiki/Chronicom_Hunters)to destroy S.H.I.E.L.D. and everyone within it.\" - Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/New_Life) With all of the upgrades made to the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), including to the [Jump Drive](/wiki/Phase_Harmonic_Teleportation_Device), which turned the plane into a time machine, and [a](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) [Life-Model Decoy](/wiki/Life-Model_Decoy) of [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) being created to help them on their mission, the three jumped back to [2019](/wiki/2019), right after they left [Earth](/wiki/Earth). Simmons and Fitz lowered the [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module) to the ground, as that's where Fitz would be waiting in while Simmons went to the past, so she could send him through the [Quantum Realm](/wiki/Quantum_Realm), but it also was where they had their [daughter](/wiki/Alya_Fitz) kept for safety. They reunited with [Piper](/wiki/Piper) and [Flint](/wiki/Flint/Monolith_Recreation), and Simmons filled them in on what was happening, but also ordered them to guard the Module with their lives, promising Piper anything she wanted in return. Simmons also left instructions to open the Module if they didn't return, saying they'd know what to do. Simmons and Fitz kissed each other goodbye, although Fitz assured her that for them, it would only be an instant. With the Module being protected, Simmons returned to the Zephyr where [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) was, and he put the [implant](/wiki/D.I.A.N.A.) inside her head, causing her to no longer know Fitz's location, but also that she has a daughter. Shortly after, Simmons and Enoch were joined by [four](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) [people](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) [in hazmat suits](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez), so Simmons instructed them on what had to be done. [[124]](#cite_note-AoS713-124) Simmons then entered the [Temple of the Forgotten](/wiki/Temple_of_the_Forgotten) to retrieve the rest of the team. The people in hazmat suits proceeded to gather all the weapons and a fragment of the [Time Di'Alla](/wiki/Time_Di%27Alla). Simmons assured the team that [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) will be fine as she injected her with a formula that will heal her wounds and save her life. She then told them that they need to leave, and addressed [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie)'s concerns for leaving the Monoliths behind, saying they would be gone soon. As May was put into a [Cryo-Freeze Chamber](/wiki/Cryo-Freeze_Chamber), they made their way onto the Zephyr, where Johnson expressed her confusion for the changes that have occurred, which she revealed that she had help and time. When [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) asked about Fitz, Simmons mentioned that she didn't know, nor could she know. Simmons continued to escort Mackenzie and Johnson through the Zephyr One, as they continued to be confused. Simmons explained that the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) wanted to turn Earth into Chronyca-3, and they think S.H.I.E.L.D. is the only thing in their way. So not only did they destroy the Lighthouse, they also plan to go through time and target S.H.I.E.L.D. at different historical moments. Simmons then activated the Zephyr One, contacted Fitz, who prepared them for launch. They were then transported through time to the [1931](/wiki/1930s/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms#1931) in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City). When Johnson pointed out the [Empire State Building](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_State_Building), Simmons revealed to them that they had traveled through time. Simmons then activated the cloaking on the ship so they could remain hidden, and Mackenzie asked if there was anything else she was going to reveal to them, for which there was. Simmons began to tell them that as the Hunters have the [Toolbox](/wiki/Toolbox), Enoch came up with an idea that they need a guide aware of all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s history to help them know how to stop the Hunters and where they would go. Simmons addressed that what they should consult with May first, but she was currently out of commission, and a vote would prove unnecessary, as well as Simmons already being aware of Coulson's views on this idea. Simmons then revealed that an advanced LMD, with Chronicom hardware, had been built with all of Coulson's memories and knowledge of what he missed since his death, and making him the perfect right hand man for Mackenzie. Simmons then brought them to where the [LMD](/wiki/Life-Model_Decoy) was kept, and Enoch gave them a button to activate him. Mackenzie attempted to think about it with reason, but without hesitation, Johnson pressed the button, and the [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) LMD awoke, greeting them all. [[123]](#cite_note-AoS613-123) After staring in silent awe of Coulson, Simmons began to inform him of what was happening and how she uploaded everything he missed, as the extent of his mind from the real Coulson were from his time in the [Framework](/wiki/Framework). They all continued to watch as Coulson examined himself, feeling something was wrong, until Johnson revealed to him that he was an LMD. Simmons tried to soften this shock upon Coulson, but he soon began to take in everything that he missed all at once, overwhelming him, forcing Mackenzie to shut him down, telling Simmons and Johnson, that LMDs were his decision. Mackenzie then ordered Simmons to inform the rest of them on everything that was happening. Simmons retold the team of the Chronicoms' plan to eliminate S.H.I.E.L.D. throughout history and that they could not waste any time. Simmons then explained the new upgrades of the Zephyr One, how they couldn't travel to any time they want, only specific points time and space. They then discussed why they were in 1931, as S.H.I.E.L.D. did not exist at that point, which Simmons did not know. Simmons then led them to the new control room to show them what they had to work with, where she also reintroduced them to Enoch. Johnson asked Simmons how long it took to rebuild the Zephyr One and solve time travel, which she explained was simple to build, but it took time for Fitz to design it. They asked about Fitz, which she explained that it was dangerous for any of them to know where he was. Simmons then reiterated the importance of stopping the Chronicoms, so Mackenzie told them to get ready. Simmons gave Shaw some money to buy some time appropriate clothes. Johnson then spoke with Simmons about May's status and how long they've been apart. Simmons and [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) interrupted [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie)'s conversation with [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) to inform them that the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) have already began to change history, so a team went out to investigate. Simmons and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) stayed behind on the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), where they watched as [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) healed [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May). Rodriguez asked Simmons about whether they could trust Enoch, which she guaranteed, having personally been through a lot with him. After Simmons told Rodriguez that May should be fully healed soon, she then informed her that the [Shrike](/wiki/Shrike) material inside her was being broken down within her body, much to the relief of Rodriguez. When Rodriguez asked if she was cleared to go outside, Simmons then brought her a new pair of [prosthetic arms](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez%27s_Prosthetic_Arms) for her to wear so she could blend in. Rodriguez initially refused, not wanting to forget what happened nor being ashamed of them, but Simmons told her she didn't have to be, and asked how long it has been since she felt something with her hands. Simmons then went to try and find a message sent by [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), but was unable to. Rodrigues joined her, having put on the new arms, and they discussed Simmons being separated from Fitz, something they have been through numerous times. [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) returned to the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) in a stolen truck, revealing the unconscious [Chronicom](/wiki/Cain) they brought with them. Seeing that he was coming back online, Simmons told them to tie Cain up so they could get some answers out of him. Once Cain awoke, Enoch explained that he would withstand any form of interrogation, so Simmons brought in a device to overwhelm his system, having seen when Coulson awoke that he uncontrollably spoke, hoping Cain would reveal the Chronicoms' plan. Simmons then forcefully inserted a plug into the back of Cain's head, and began her interrogation. Because Cain refused to answer them, Simmons began to generate junk data into him, causing him to glitch. The interrogation proceeded to take some time, as Cain continued to not reveal anything, only telling them that the Chronicoms had studied [Earth](/wiki/Earth)'s history for years, allowing them to know how to destroy [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.). Simmons then increased the amount of junk data, which Enoch warned her could shut down his system. As Cain continue to glitch, Enoch told Simmons to stop the interrogation, so she pulled out the plug, but they discovered that he was causing himself to glitch. Cain soon revealed that their target was someone named [Freddy](/wiki/Wilfred_Malick/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms), as he then melted, so they informed the team at the party. [[126]](#cite_note-AoS701-126) Debating HYDRA's Future[ ] - \" [Freddy Malick](/wiki/Wilfred_Malick/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms)is about to deliver the key ingredient used to create the [Super Soldier Serum](/wiki/Super_Soldier_Serum).\" - Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Know_Your_Onions) Simmons was contacted by [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) to meet them at the speakeasy to save the life of [Viola](/wiki/Viola), who had been shot, so she and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) acquired some time appropriate clothes and made their way. Once they arrived, Simmons spoke the codeword to [Ernest Koenig](/wiki/Ernest_Koenig) to let them in, where Simmons began to operate on Viola, despite Koenig's complaints. As the others discussed the situation, Simmons was able to successfully remove the bullet from Viola's body. When the others discussed saving [Freddy Malick](/wiki/Wilfred_Malick/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms), [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) voiced killing Malick, which Simmons jumped in telling them that killing Malick was the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) intention, of which they knew the outcome of. Rodriguez suggested neither killing or saving Malick, but influence him to be good instead, which Simmons noted would still be changing the timeline. Koenig informed them that the police were searching for Malick, so they decided to leave and take Viola to a hospital. The team prepared to move [Viola](/wiki/Viola), but [Ernest Koenig](/wiki/Ernest_Koenig) informed to them that the police were outside, so he directed them to a secret room in his office, as there was no other exit. As they hid in the room while the Chronicoms searched the place, Viola awoke, so Simmons acted quickly and covered her mouth so she didn't alert the Chronicoms of their presence. However, as Viola struggled against them, she kicked a bottle, causing it to shatter, alerting the Chronicoms, but they were soon called away. They then exited the room and began to interrogate Viola as Simmons inspected her passport. Simmons then discovered a green droplet on Viola's shoe, so she went to examine it, suspecting it to do with the [Super Soldier Serum](/wiki/Super_Soldier_Serum), having found that Viola visited [Germany](/wiki/Germany) six times in the last year and that it was [1931](/wiki/1930s#1931). To be sure of her theory, Simmons collected the droplet and asked for specific ingredients as she began to conduct her experiment, hoping that she was wrong. After she fully set up her experiment, Koenig watched on, commenting on Simmons' intelligence. Simmons soon produced a result from her experiment, revealing to the rest of the team that the compound was apart of the Super Soldier Serum, which would first appear during [World War II](/wiki/World_War_II), synthesized by [Abraham Erskine](/wiki/Abraham_Erskine) and used by [Johann Schmidt](/wiki/Johann_Schmidt), and that Malick was delivering the key component to the serum. Upon learning this information, they all began to discuss their next actions, reopening whether to stop or save Malick, knowing what would happen. [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) contacted them, so Simmons responded, stopping [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD), as she didn't know about him. Simmons attempted to keep May on the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), but she went to find [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw). Not able to deal with May, they refocused on the mission, so they continued to interrogate Viola, until she accidentally revealed the location of where Malick was heading, which Koenig explained to them was [Hell's Harbor](/wiki/Hell%27s_Harbor). Koenig refused to give them directions unless they took him with them. They decided to take Koenig, and returned to Zephyr One where they found May beating [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch). Coulson was able to stop May, who was not phased by his presence, which they all found strange. May allowed Simmons to sedate her with no resistance and return her inside the [Healing Pod](/wiki/Healing_Pod). The team discussed May's actions, and then brought Koenig inside, shocking him by being inside what he interpreted as a rocketship, believing the team to be martians. Koenig then gave them directions to Hell's Harbor, and the team rushed to save Mackenzie and Shaw. As they approached, Simmons received an alert that the Time Window would close in seventeen minutes, so she informed the rest of the team, explaining that the Zephyr One will depart with or without them. When they arrived, Simmons stayed on the Zephyr One with Rodriguez as the rest went to rescue Mackenzie and Shaw, as well as ensure Malick's safety. With two minutes remaining, the team returned the Zephyr One without Enoch. Knowing that they had to leave, Mackenzie gave the order to close the door, leaving Enoch behind in 1931, just as they saw him coming. [[127]](#cite_note-AoS702-127) [Infiltration into Area 51](/wiki/Infiltration_into_Area_51)[ ] - \"If the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms)have infiltrated, they would all look and act exactly like this.\" \"Okay, but now you're just trafficking in stereotypes.\" \"Well, I mean, perhaps. But until a more diverse population goes into STEM fields, I'm afraid... any one of them could easily be mistaken for a Chronicom.\" - Jemma Simmons and [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) [[src]](/wiki/Alien_Commies_from_the_Future!) Upon their arrival in a different time period, [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) started to fall, before its autopilot pulled them out of the dive. Once they landed, [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) reminded them that they left [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) behind, much to Simmons' regret. They then began to question where they were, so Simmons picked up a walkie-talkie and tuned in on a signal, the team found out that they were in [1955](/wiki/1950s/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms#1955). Coulson then added that they had landed near [Area 51](/wiki/Area_51), so their presence wouldn't be too odd. Simmons explained to the team that the reason why they weren't back in their time was because the mission was not over for them. [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) asked if they would know when the mission is over, Simmons explained how the Zephyr One used pieces of the [Time Di'Alla](/wiki/Time_Di%27Alla) to jump forward in time, and that they were drafting through time in the Chronicom's wake. Simmons then noted that she didn't know how many jumps in time they had left, but it would stop once the threat is stopped. They then began to formulate a plan to uncover what the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) were doing in 1955, until Coulson found that there was project in Area 51 during 1955 called [Helius](/wiki/Project_Helius). Simmons then explained that Helius was an early attempt at an [Ion Fusion Reactor](/wiki/Helius), but it never functioned properly. However, [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) revealed that in his future, Ion Fusion was used to power the weapons on the ships that could destroy enemy ships. Once the team returned from kidnapping [Gerald Sharpe](/wiki/Gerald_Sharpe), Coulson took his identity, and Simmons was disguised as [Peggy Carter](/wiki/Peggy_Carter) so they could infiltrate Area 51. As [Peggy [Gerald Sharpe](/wiki/Gerald_Sharpe), Simmons to [Area 51](/wiki/Area_51). Once they arrived, Lieutenant [Carpenter](/wiki/Carpenter) welcomed them, initially declining Simmons access, until they informed him she was Carter, and the two entered the base, with Coulson acknowledging how much Simmons was enjoying pretending to be her hero. The two were led into the laboratory by [Pascal Vega](/wiki/Pascal_Vega), which Simmons was in awe of witnessing, as she had always wanted to see the lab. Vega then began to present to them some of the creations they had built in the lab, including the prototypes for the [Walkie-Talkie Wristwatch](/wiki/Walkie-Talkie_Wristwatch) and an [EMP Generator](/wiki/EMP_Generator), which Simmons commented that she could send them forward decades in just an hour. Vega then showed them to a model of [Helius](/wiki/Helius), explaining that the actual Helius was on the testing field and showed them surveillance of it. Simmons and Coulson then asked about the people on the base, which Vega revealed the science team were the only ones to enter the base. They then asked to questions them, which they covered for being about a test they did. Simmons and Coulson then had the science team gathered and sitting before them for questioning. Before they began their questioning to determine if any of them were [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms), Simmons noted a similarity between the Chronicoms and the science team, which Coulson responded that she was just stereotyping, even though she wasn't wrong. However, they did not need to test if they were Chronicoms, but if they were [humans](/wiki/Humans), by triggering an emotional response. They then began their questioning, with Simmons asking the first person how many fingers she was holding up, only to cut him off before answering. Coulson then asked the next person if [John Wayne](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne) was overrated, and Simmons told the person after that a sad story about love, making him cry. For the next person, Coulson repeatably spoke the word \"moist\", making him cringe, as well as Simmons. Vega returned, informing them of more people arriving to witness the Helius test, so Coulson left Simmons to continue inside the base. As Simmons dealt with the last two scientists, she had a conversation in German with one about [Heisenberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg)'s [Uncertainty Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_Principle). During her questioning, Simmons was interrupted by [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms), who addressed her as Carter, to which Simmons was not aware of his identity. The two then began to talk, and Simmons informed Sousa of the possible infiltration, and began asking him some questions to learn where he arrived from. After learning his name was Daniel and he was in charge of [SSR office](/wiki/Auerbach_Theatrical_Agency) in [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles), she realized he knew she wasn't Carter, and Sousa arrested her. Simmons and [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) were locked up together, until they were later rescued by [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson), who convinced [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) to release them. However, when Johnson attempted to leave with the two, Sousa refused. However, when an alarm went off, Coulson locked Sousa in the cell, with Simmons confirming Coulson's admiration for Sousa to him as they went to investigate. Simmons, Coulson and Johnson went outside, where they witnessed [Helius](/wiki/Helius) being activated. Finding [Pascal Vega](/wiki/Pascal_Vega), Simmons enquired if it could be stopped, to which he revealed that once it started, there was no turning it off. When Coulson told Vega to evacuate everyone at the [base](/wiki/Area_51), Simmons expressed that there wouldn't be enough time to get to safety. [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) then joined them and went after the [Chronicom](/wiki/Chronicoms) that had infiltrated the base, as the rest of them went to try and stop Helius from exploding. Returning to the lab, Simmons rushed to the [EMP Generator](/wiki/EMP_Generator), believing if she made some modifications to it, she could stop Helius from going off. When Johnson revealed that she couldn't hack the computers, Simmons asked her to assist her in fixing the EMP. However, when another Chronicom entered and attacked Johnson, Coulson charged at him, knocking him out of the room, as Simmons commented on how she kept forgetting how strong he was now. With the help of Johnson, the two were able to fix the EMP, and activated it, stopping Helius and the Chronicoms. [[3]](#cite_note-AoS703-3) [Saving [EMP Generator](/wiki/EMP_Generator) going off, [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) was shut down and arrested by [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms), so Simmons and [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) returned to [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One). From the assistance of [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch), Coulson made contact with the team, informing them that it was the day that Sousa died. They then discussed how the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) killed [Niles Lindmore](/wiki/Niles_Lindmore/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms), who was meant to deliver a device to Sousa, so they planned to keep the mission on track with history. When [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) returned to the Zephyr with the device, the team looked at it, all unimpressed by it, except for Simmons, who was overwhelmed with excitement about it, comparing it to the [Rosetta Stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone) of [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) technology. However, they were all confused when [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) began to get equally excited as Simmons about the device. With the device now in their possession, a team took a [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet) to meet up with Coulson on the train with Sousa to complete the mission, as Simmons stayed on the Zephyr. When the team returned to the Zephyr, bringing Sousa with them, Simmons greeted him after their last encounter, when she pretended to be [Peggy Carter](/wiki/Peggy_Carter). After [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) revealed Simmons true identity to Sousa, May joined them and began to feel off, causing everyone to worry, so Simmons escorted her to the medical bay to check on her. Once Simmons did a scan on May's vitals, the results came up that nothing was wrong with her, to her confusion. Simmons asked May why she felt so disoriented, as Rodriguez joined them, revealing that May had a panic attack back in [Area 51](/wiki/Area_51). May told Simmons that she didn't tell her about it because it wasn't like her, which Simmons agreed with, believing it to be all the more reason to tell her. They then discussed May's emotions, about how she always had them under control and pushed down, and now she felt nothing until she is suddenly overwhelmed by emotions. May then explained to Simmons what happened during the mission in Area 51, stating that it was the first time she had felt anything since her experience in the [Temple of the Forgotten](/wiki/Temple_of_the_Forgotten). May explained that she was in a world where there is no feeling and since then, she has lost control of her own emotions. Simmons then recalled how May became excited when she saw the device, which Rodriguez noted that only Simmons feels that way about technology. They then discussed May's most recent episode, where she explained how she felt confused right after she shook Sousa's hand, only to realize that she was feeling other people's emotions when she touches them. Understanding what was the problem with her, May then went on to reveal that Sousa was also feeling the urge to run, which was proven when they witnessed Sousa leave on a motorcycle. With Mackenzie making the decision to save Sousa from his death during the mission, the team quickly boarded the Quinjet to get to him before his killer did. Simmons joined the team with Mackenzie, Coulson and Johnson as May flew them, and once they landed, Simmons and Johnson got changed to prepare to execute the plan. After having Coulson pretend to be Sousa so he could fake his death, Simmons and Johnson arrived at the scene, impersonating morticians. Simmons and Johnson collected Coulson from the pool so no one would know the truth and returned to the Zephyr. Having successfully faked Sousa's death, the team brought him back onboard, where they had him resting from being shot with an [I.C.E.R.](/wiki/I.C.E.R.). Simmons then began to fix Coulson, who had been experiencing no color and an internal monologue after the EMP shut him down. Once she restored him, May joined them and grabbed Coulson's hand, to Simmons' joy, but she stated that she felt nothing off him. The team then made their next jump, and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) hijacked a radio, only for them to learn they were in [1973](/wiki/1970s/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms#1973) after hearing the song [No More Mr. Nice Guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_More_Mr._Nice_Guy_(song)). [[128]](#cite_note-AoS704-128) Problems with D.I.A.N.A.[ ] While on [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) as the others went to find [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch), Simmons began to have problems with [D.I.A.N.A.](/wiki/D.I.A.N.A.), as she started to have troubles with her memories. [[129]](#cite_note-AoS706-129) [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) joined her, talking about his combat training that [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) ordered him to do, although Simmons was distracted by her own problem, of which she could not tell anyone else. When Shaw brought up [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), Simmons told him that they would be reunited soon, which Shaw wanted, needing them to birth his [mother](/wiki/Alya_Shaw) so he could then be born. When [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) made contact with Simmons from the [The Krazy Kanoe](/wiki/The_Krazy_Kanoe), he told her about [Wilfred Malick](/wiki/Wilfred_Malick/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) being alive and overseeing [Project Insight](/wiki/Project_Insight), and how Enoch was nowhere to be found. Simmons offered to search for Enoch, but Coulson told her that Project Insight was there top priority. Shaw joined her, expressing his regret for letting Malick live back in [1931](/wiki/1930s#1931), but Simmons told him that he made the right call preserving the timeline. However, Shaw still believed that Malick being alive longer was not right. Once the team returned to the Zephyr, they discussed [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA) starting up Project Insight early with the Chronicoms help in the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse), and how they could stop it. Suddenly, the Time Window closed as the Chronicoms were leaving early, forcing them to jump three years forward, where Project Insight had been completed. Simmons went to find Enoch to tell him about the problems she was having remembering certain things, so he went to help her. However, they were stopped by [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms), who demanded she tell him why they jumped, although she didn't know. When Sousa became angry at her, Shaw stepped in to defend Simmons. [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) then gathered the team and informed them of the mission to stop [Project Insight](/wiki/Project_Insight), which Simmons would stay on the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) with Mackenzie and [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) to oversee. Soon after, Simmons noted that [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) was not responding, as Simmons saw that her signal dropped. Simmons attempted to reach Johnson and [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms), but was unsuccessful, so the team had to find another way through the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). Once the charges were set, Simmons waited for Mackenzie's go ahead, but he aborted the mission when he saw \" [his](/wiki/John_Mackenzie/Chronicom) [parents](/wiki/Lilla_Mackenzie/Chronicom)\" were prisoners who would be killed. With the mission to flood the Lighthouse failed, Mackenzie ordered Simmons and Enoch to prepare to fire upon the rocket. Once the missiles were armed, Enoch flew towards the rocket, which had begun to take off, and they were able to destroy it, stopping Project Insight. However, in doing so, they gave away the Zephyr's position, leaving them open for attack. [[130]](#cite_note-AoS705-130) They were rejoined by [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw), who revealed they killed [Wilfred Malick](/wiki/Wilfred_Malick/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms). As Mackenzie left, he ordered Simmons to search for Johnson and Sousa, however, the Zephyr was attacked, taking serious damage. [[129]](#cite_note-AoS706-129) Repairs[ ] - \" [D.I.A.N.A.](/wiki/D.I.A.N.A.)is acting up, and I'm... I'm forgetting the things I'm supposed to know, and more dangerously, I'm remembering the things I'm not.\" \"We'll fix the implant. Don't worry.\" \"We're far more likely to blow a hole through space-time, then D.I.A.N.A. won't matter, anyway.\" Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) put out a fire in [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) revealed that the shielding was damaged, which could destroy the Zephyr if they made another jump, so Simmons instructed them on repairing the ship immediately. After sending Shaw off, Simmons expressed her worry to Enoch on whether she was meant to remember how to fix the Zephyr, due to the troubles with [D.I.A.N.A.](/wiki/D.I.A.N.A.), so Enoch decided to fix the implant right away. Enoch put Simmons in an unconscious state and began to repair D.I.A.N.A. However, when Shaw noticed them, he believed Enoch had turned against them and knocked him out to save Simmons. Upon waking up abruptly, Simmons was confused by seeing Shaw, and discovered what he had done to Enoch. With no time to wait for Enoch to wake up, Simmons decided to get back to repairing the Zephyr, as Shaw attempted to explain his actions, but she tried to tell him that he was wrong. However, Shaw demanded that Simmons gave him real answers, so Simmons decided to reveal to Shaw that Enoch was fixing her memories. Simmons proceeded to explain to Shaw that in order to track the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) through time, [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) decided to stay behind in a place where they could observe all of their moves, but he was exposed, so Simmons built a device to block her memories so she wouldn't know where he was. Shaw was concerned that she won't be able to find Fitz again, but Simmons explained that the problem was she might, as D.I.A.N.A. was acting up, affecting her memories. Not being able to fix D.I.A.N.A., Simmons and Shaw focused on fixing the Zephyr, which they were successfully able to do, restoring the shielding before their next jump. Once Enoch woke up, he returned to repairing D.I.A.N.A. for Simmons. As Shaw stood in the room with them, Simmons got him to apologise to Enoch for attacking him, as well as telling him he was a valued member of their family. Once Enoch finished, Shaw tested if Simmons knew where Fitz was, which she didn't anymore. Simmons then begged that Shaw kept what he found out a secret, which he promised. [[129]](#cite_note-AoS706-129) Jumping Through Time[ ] - \"So, this is what we're dealing with. We've lost control of... of the [time drive](/wiki/Phase_Harmonic_Teleportation_Device). At this rate, the [Zephyr](/wiki/Zephyr_One)will collapse into a space-time singularity in two days. Or, relatively speaking, 20 minutes.\" - Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/After,_Before) The rest of the team returned, and Simmons treated [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) in the [Healing Pod](/wiki/Healing_Pod) and told [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) it was his last chance to leave the mission before they jumped again, but he stated that he decided to stay with them. [[129]](#cite_note-AoS706-129) After they made their next jump, [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) exited [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), so Simmons decided to give him space and inspect the time drive with [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch), although [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) decided to go after him. When [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) reported that they hadn't returned, the time drive began to deteriorate, so she attempted to contact Shaw to get them to return. However, they were unable to get back, and the team departed, leaving the two in [1982](/wiki/1980s/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms#1982). After the jump, Enoch noted that they went forward 481 days, when they were suddenly informed they had 20 minutes before their next jump, they searched for Mackenzie and Shaw, but couldn't get a hold of them. Simmons suspected that there may be a pattern to the jumps, informing the rest of the team that the cause behind the abrupt jumps was the damage from the missile. Another jump happened, sending them 20 months forward since they left Mackenzie and Shaw behind, but because Simmons had uncovered the pattern, May and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) went off to retrieve them. As Simmons waited as the next jump occurred, she was immediately reunited with the team, who had been away for 27 days. With the team back together, Simmons, who had calculated the pattern between jumps, informed them of their current situation, explaining how they will collapse into a space-time singularity in two days, but for them it would be 20 minutes. As Simmons tried to explain how it all worked, she, too, was unable to fully understand what was happening, and they were unable to disconnect the fuel cell regulator, due to the pulses from the time drive disintegrating anything that touches it. When they realized that Rodriguez could go fast enough to go through the pulses, Simmons was unable to come up with a solution on how to heal her. They were joined by Johnson, who noted that her [mother](/wiki/Jiaying/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) could, as she would be at [Afterlife](/wiki/Afterlife) currently, and knows the most about [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans) and their powers. They agreed to the plan, so Simmons figured out how much time May and Rodriguez would have to get back, and joined Mackenzie and Johnson, as they went to discuss the implications of the mission with [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD), who Simmons had built a new body for. Simmons informed Mackenzie that she was able to reboot Coulson, so he told her to, despite his body not yet being completed. After activated Coulson, Simmons listened as they discussed the severity of the mission, as if something went wrong that would alter the Timeline, it could impact Johnson being born. However, they decided to proceed with the mission, as the rest of the team on the Zephyr attempted to find other solutions, but Shaw informed Simmons of their failure to shut down the time drive, making her wish they had more time. As they waited and put their faith in Rodriguez, Simmons told Coulson they were workiong as fast as they could, and advised Johnson to return to the Healing Pod, but she told Simmons that she couldn't save everyone. However, after she noticed Sousa walk by, she responded that she could try, as she went to gift Sousa with a [new leg](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa%27s_Prosthetic_Leg). Simmons joined Sousa in the cargo hold as he was preparing parachutes, asking if Simmons had ever jumped out of a plane, which she recounted on her two times doing so, one without a parachute. Simmons then revealed to Sousa the advanced prosthetic leg she made for him after he joined them, in case they were going to be stuck in the past, so he would no longer have trouble walking. Grateful for Simmons' gift, he apologized for snapping at her during the [1970s](/wiki/1970s), but she understood, as they pulled him from his time and life, but he didn't see that as a valid excuse. Sousa then acknowledged how now they were in the same situation, and Simmons was reminded that she would need to leave a final message for [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), in case they are unable to repair the time drive, stranding them in 1983. Moving to work stations, Simmons sat in front of a monitor and recorded her message to Fitz. She explained the situation that they were in, as well as expressing her uncertainty as to why she lost contact with him after departing the [Temple of the Forgotten](/wiki/Temple_of_the_Forgotten), and that now the time drive was malfunctioning, potentially stranding them in 1983. However, Simmons remained hopeful that even if they were to be stranded in time, that she would find someway to reunite with Fitz, having never been stopped by time or space to be with each other. After she finished the message, Shaw, who had been listening, informed Simmons that May and Rodriguez would be returning soon, and they were all gathering in the bridge. Once they were all gathered and waiting, Johnson asked what would happen if Rodriguez didn't have her powers back, which Simmons explained that they would lose the Zephyr, adding that they may not even be able to evacuate in time either. Mackenzie gave the order for them to abandon ship, but May and Rodriguez returned, and Rodriguez was able to regain her powers, allowing her to deactivate the time drive. With the Zephyr no longer in danger, Simmons told Coulson that he needed to recharge, so she accompanied him to power him down. [[131]](#cite_note-AoS708-131) Stuck in a Time-Loop[ ] - \"I think I'm time-looping. I-I've done this already. I've done this already.\" \"Oh, well, that's fun.\" - [Daisy the [Time Drive](/wiki/Phase_Harmonic_Teleportation_Device) caused [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) to jump within a jump, tearing a hole in space-time, the team found themselves trapped in a time storm. As Simmons examined the Time Drive, she informed the rest that radiation levels were off the chart, stressing the need to escape. [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) was soon brought to her, having been blinded by a radiation flare, so Simmons treated his burns. The Time Drive then caused a feedback, propelling the team into a time-loop. In the next loop, [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) came to Simmons, revealing that she was time-looping, which Simmons immediately absorbed without question. As Simmons went to check her, Johnson predicted [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw)'s cologne in the draw, [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch)'s arrival in the lab to help with the Time Drive, and a fire in the hallway, to Simmons' bewilderment. In a later loop, Shaw approached Simmons, revealing the time-loop, suggesting that they remove [D.I.A.N.A.](/wiki/D.I.A.N.A.) to learn how to fix the Time Drive. Simmons was hesitant to agree, but they were discovered by Johnson and [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD). Simmons then informed the two about how she had the implant blocking her memory to protect [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), but Johnson and Coulson told her that it was important that they found a way to fix the Time Drive. Simmons asked for proof that they were stuck in a time-loop, so Johnson asked her to say a fake word, in which they both said \"phlebotinum\" at the same time. Believing them, Simmons then prepared to remove D.I.A.N.A. as the others watched. However, before she could begin, Simmons started to violently cough until she collapsed and died, with the rest helpless to save her. In the next loop, Johnson decided to go in the room with Simmons, but both of them began coughing, from what was revealed to be a gas leak, dying again. After several loops the same as the original ones, Johnson and Coulson rounded up Simmons, Shaw and Enoch to question them about Simmons' murder. Because she was the victim, Simmons was ruled out as a suspect, and both Shaw and Enoch stated they wouldn't murder Simmons, which she supported, being confused by the drastic measures. In the next loop, Johnson approached Simmons, and told her about the time-loop, proving it again by both of them saying the same word, convincing Simmons. They then went to commence with removing the implant, but were unable to within the loop. In the next loop, Coulson called Simmons and Enoch to the cargo hold with Johnson and Shaw, where he revealed that Enoch was programmed to keep the implant from being removed to protect Fitz. They all initially did not believe Coulson's theory, but when Johnson attempted to remove D.I.A.N.A., Enoch attacked them, grabbing Johnson by the throat. When Simmons asked Enoch to stop, he revealed the programming she put in him to kill if necessary. In another loop, Coulson and Johnson came to Simmons, convincing her to remove the implant, and as they prepared, Simmons assured Johnson it would be easy. However, when Enoch discovered them, his programming activated and he stopped Johnson, throwing her against the wall. In the next loop, they tried again, having [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) distract Enoch, but he failed and were stopped again. In one of the several loops trying to stop Enoch, Coulson and Johnson had Simmons directly tell Enoch to countermand an order, but they failed as it required a password, so Enoch beat up Coulson and Johnson. In later loops, Sousa spoke with Simmons about removing D.I.A.N.A., so that when he left, Enoch would follow him, allowing the implant to be removed. Before they could begin, they Time Drive activated, causing the time-loop to reset. They then repeated everything but faster in the next loop, allowing Johnson to finally remove the D.I.A.N.A.. With her memories returning to her, Simmons realized that Enoch was the key to saving them, using his [Electrochron Displacement Mechanism](/wiki/Electrochron_Displacement_Mechanism), which would kill him if removed. Suddenly, more of her memories returned, causing Simmons to become devastated. The time-loop reset once more, and Johnson contacted Simmons, telling her to met her in the [LMD](/wiki/LMD) lab with Enoch. Once they all gathered, Johnson informed them all of the situation, revealing that to save them all, they would need to use Enoch's \"heart.\" Simmons was against the idea, not wanting to lose Enoch, but as they debated it, Enoch removed the mechanism without hesitation. When Simmons reminded Enoch he would die, he took comfort in knowing they would do the same for him. Simmons and Shaw took the mechanism and successfully repaired the Time Drive. [[132]](#cite_note-AoS709-132) Fearing the Worst[ ] Returning to [1983](/wiki/1980s/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms#1983), the team decided to make base at the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). Simmons, [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) and [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) headed to the lab to set up, as they wondered why the next countdown hadn't started yet, which Simmons theorized could be because of a disruption to the transmission receiver's ability to penetrate space-time. After Johnson and Sousa had a flirtatious exchange, Simmons noticed this and commented on Sousa's chivalry, to Johnson's embarrassment. Thinking about their current problem, Simmons expressed her need for [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), who could likely solve it, which made Johnson ask about what she remembered. However, Simmons shut down the questions, not wanting to know about anything that she may have said once the [implant](/wiki/D.I.A.N.A.) was removed. Simmons attempted to assure Johnson of any confusion she may have expressed, but Johnson revealed how she became devastated upon getting her memories back, which is why she wanted to know. This then led to Simmons considering something bad may have happened to Fitz. The two were then radioed by [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) to join the team in the control room, so they made their way. Mackenzie addressed that even if they could leave, they weren't knowing that [Nathaniel Malick](/wiki/Nathaniel_Malick/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) was out there causing chaos, having already attacked [Afterlife](/wiki/Afterlife). They decided to take back the settlement, so Simmons was told to give [Jiaying](/wiki/Jiaying/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) their coordinates. As the team discussed the decision, Simmons sent the coordinates, and [Gordon](/wiki/Gordon/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) immediately appeared with Jiaying, who revealed that they were being hunted by Malick. Simmons stayed silent during the conversation between the team and Jiaying, as they decided to have [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) and Gordon rescue the [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans) in danger, as well as Jiaying revealing she had another [daughter](/wiki/Kora/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms). While the others focused on the mission, Simmons went to see [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw), who was inspecting the [Time Drive](/wiki/Phase_Harmonic_Teleportation_Device) in the [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), and they both talked about [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) and his sacrifice, with Simmons recounting how he had been there for her and Fitz before. When Shaw mentioned finding out why the Time Drive wasn't communicating with Fitz anymore, Simmons then revealed her theory that maybe it never was, believing that they were just following the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms), as every jump after they were [defeated](/wiki/Destruction_of_the_Chronicom_Time_Ship) was a malfunction. When Shaw questioned why Fitz wouldn't help them, he understood what Simmons was thinking from looking at her, but didn't want to think Fitz was dead, which Simmons suggested may be why she blocked her memories, as it was too painful to remember. As Simmons continued to explain her theory, noting how all of her messages sent out to Fitz were never answered, Shaw refused to believe it was true, suggesting that everything was happening for a reason. Shaw attempted to comfort his grandmother, telling her that everything would fixed and they would soon be reunited with Fitz. Simmons went along with her grandson's hopeful mindset, but as she left, Simmons was still worried of the possibility that she may be right. [[133]](#cite_note-AoS710-133) Kidnapped by Nathaniel Malick[ ] - \"Why am I here? What do you want?\" \"My pal [Sibyl](/wiki/Sibyl)ran the numbers, and every outcome where we don't come out on top has one thing in common.\" \" [Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz).\" - Jemma Simmons and [Nathaniel Malick](/wiki/Nathaniel_Malick/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) [[src]](/wiki/Stolen) When Simmons was informed of [Nathaniel Malick](/wiki/Nathaniel_Malick/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms)'s infiltration into the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse) with [John Garrett](/wiki/John_Garrett/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms), who had stolen [Gordon](/wiki/Gordon/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms)'s powers, she met up with [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms). As they were walking, Garrett suddenly appeared and grabbed Simmons, who ordered Sousa to shoot him immediately. However, before Sousa could fire, Garrett teleported them away, successfully capturing her as planned. Garrett brought Simmons onboard [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), which had been hijacked by [Nathaniel Malick's Crew](/wiki/Nathaniel_Malick%27s_Crew), who used it to escape from the Lighthouse and fly into space. After being tied up, Simmons undauntedly asked Malick what he wanted from her, which he revealed how every timeline [Sibyl](/wiki/Sibyl) predicted where they don't succeed, the cause for their failure was always the same. Simmons realized he was referring to [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), and Malick demanded that she reveal to them where to find him, so they can stop him from preventing their plans. [[133]](#cite_note-AoS710-133) To extract the information out of her, as she would never willingly give it to him, Malick put Simmons in the [Cerebral Fusion Machine](/wiki/Cerebral_Fusion_Machine) so he could search her mind for Fitz's location. However, due to her [implant](/wiki/D.I.A.N.A.) blocking her memories, Simmons was able to halt Malick from obtaining what he wanted. Instead, Simmons showed Malick old memories of Fitz, including when they were trapped in the bottom of the ocean, and their conversation after the [Battle of Maveth](/wiki/Battle_of_Maveth) about their relationship. Frustrated by his failures, Malick exited the machine and demanded to know how Simmons was blocking him, but she stated she wasn't, questioning his ability, causing Malick to slap her. Understanding her refusal to comply, Malick decided to bring in [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw), who was also onboard the Zephyr and had been tortured by Garrett, to get Simmons to talk. Simmons then become extremely concerned, not initially knowing Shaw was present, as she witnessed Shaw enter the room, bloody and bruised. Garrett proceeded to beat up Shaw, with Simmons begging him to stop, although Shaw never broke from the physical pain. Malick then decided to use emotional pain to get the information he wanted, as threatened to crack Simmons' skull with his powers, putting her into a coma. As Malick began to painfully vibrate Simmons' head, D.I.A.N.A. revealed itself, so Malick stopped, now knowing about the implant. After knocking Shaw unconcsious, Malick now focused on removing the implant from her head. When Malick found the implant removal device, he became more frustrated as Simmons explained she was the only one who could use it. Noting his 0% chance of extracting the implant, Simmons began to taunt Malick about his failures, saying that Fitz would be coming to save her and stop him. With everything else failed, Malick decided to go into the machine with Simmons and explore her memories. After they went through some of Simmons' last memories of Fitz, Malick was still unsuccessful and decided to leave them. When Simmons went to check on Shaw, he discovered she had forgotten who Fitz was. [[125]](#cite_note-AoS711-125) Struggling with her Memory[ ] As designed by [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), the [implant](/wiki/D.I.A.N.A.) enacted its emergency safety measures, causing Simmons to completely forget everything. Simmons and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) were taken onboard the main [Chronicom Destroyer Ship](/wiki/Chronicom_Destroyer_Ship), where [Nathaniel Malick](/wiki/Nathaniel_Malick/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) gave Simmons one last chance to give up Fitz, before being injected by the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) and locked in a cell. While the injection slowly dissolved D.I.A.N.A., Shaw attempted to help Simmons regain her memory of Fitz, whose name she was able to recognize upon hearing it. Believing it would help, Shaw began to impersonate Fitz, but Simmons mistook him for [James Bond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond_(literary_character)). Shaw then theorized about what the injection was doing to Simmons, due to the Chroncioms thinking she had a secret, which she remembered she did, just not what specifically. Overwhelmed by the her memories uncontrollably coming and going, Simmons decided to rest. Simmons was awakened when [Quake](/wiki/Quake) forcibly opened the cell doors, having come to rescue her and Shaw, but Simmons was still having problems with her memory, and couldn't remember Quake. Shaw reminded Simmons that Quake was their friend, and that she was going to help them escape, but when they tried to leave, Simmons asked Quake about her costume. Quake explained that it wasn't a costume, but for her protection, so Simmons asked if she could have one, too, which they promised she could, so long as she left with them. The three then left the cell and made their way to escape from the ship. As they walked through the ship's hallways, Simmons continued to struggle with her memory, not knowing whether she was in the future or the past, as well as what was her secret that she had to keep. After not being stopped by some Chronicoms walking past, Simmons remembered that she was married, although, she could not recall who she was married to. Simmons proceeded to go on about marriage and how it was the key, but she still wasn't sure what she was talking about. However, Quake interrupted Simmons' ramblings, as they needed to keep moving, only to then be confronted by [Kora](/wiki/Kora/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms). Simmons and Shaw watched as Quake spoke with her sister, but after Kora tried to attack them, Quake told them to head to [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One). Simmons and Shaw reached the Zephyr, and were reunited with [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) and [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms), who she also couldn't remember. But, Simmons did recognize the Zephyr, remembering that it was her home, however, this was unknown to the others. While they waited for Quake to return, Simmons decided to take a seat, as the others stuck the dead Chronicoms to the ship's missiles. Once Quake returned, they began to make their escape, firing the missiles to destroy the hangar door, and proceeded to fly back to [Earth](/wiki/Earth). [[134]](#cite_note-AoS712-134) The Arrival of Leo Fitz[ ] The team arrived at [The Krazy Kanoe](/wiki/The_Krazy_Kanoe) upon receiving a coded message to head to that location. Despite being reunited with the rest of her team, Simmons did not recognize any of them, so [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) and [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) filled them in on her status. Suddenly, an impulse took over Simmons, and she moved to the bar, where she began to assemble the [0-8-4s](/wiki/0-8-4_(Code)) brought by the past [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) agents. The rest of the team noticed what Simmons was doing, and asked how she knew how to put the pieces together, which she explained by relating it to marriage, describing it as a need for them to come together. Even though she didn't know why she knew it, Simmons was successful in building a device, and used a tuning fork on it, which opened a secret room in the bar. Simmons then carried the device into the room, commenting that it was either the end or the beginning, as she couldn't exactly remember. After inserting the device onto the [machine](/wiki/Quantum_Tunnel) inside the room, nothing happened, Johnson attempted to jog Simmons' memory. Remembering that [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson) officiated her wedding, Simmons realized that she was married, leading to her making the connection that her wedding ring was the key. Simmons then took off her ring and inserted it into the machine, activating it. When a portal opened up, they all witnessed as [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) came out of it. Fitz celebrated in Simmons' success, but when he went to hug her, she pushed him away, making him realize her memory had been erased. [[134]](#cite_note-AoS712-134) While the others reunited with Fitz and discussed what they had all been through, Simmons tended to [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez)'s wound, but the arguing gave her a headache. When discussing returning the their original timeline, Johnson revealed that this was going to be their final mission together, which Simmons noted [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch) had told them that, and Fitz confirmed it. Accepting this fate, Shaw ultimately decided to stay behind, taking comfort in the possibility of them seeing him again if Simmons and Fitz birthed his [mother](/wiki/Alya_Shaw), unknown to the others that they already [had](/wiki/Alya_Fitz). Being in a disoriented state, Simmons took a seat as the rest of the team moved the Quantum Tunnel onto [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One) and prepared for take off. While traveling through the [Quantum Realm](/wiki/Quantum_Realm), to recover Simmons' memories, Fitz got her to remember her favourite star, [Theta Serpentis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_Serpentis), leading to them recounting what happened to them after the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms) [attacked](/wiki/Ambush_at_the_Lighthouse) the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). Simmons was able to remember who Fitz was, but couldn't remember her daughter, and therefore didn't understand why they stayed out in space for as long as they did. [[124]](#cite_note-AoS713-124) Finishing the Mission[ ] Successfully returning to their original timeline, along with the entire [Chronicom](/wiki/Chronicoms) fleet, the team split into two groups, with Simmons, [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) and [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) being tasked with retaking the Lighthouse, while the others would infiltrate the [Chronicom Destroyer Ship](/wiki/Chronicom_Destroyer_Ship). However, due to them arriving a few moments before they left in [2019](/wiki/2019), the team were required to revisit the [Temple of the Forgotten](/wiki/Temple_of_the_Forgotten) in hazmat suits to assist the past Simmons, as a part of the predestination paradox they were in. The ground team entered the [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet), and headed for the temple, landing near the past [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One), where they were all greeted by the past Simmons and [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch). Making sure not to engage with their past selves, the four followed the past Simmons into the temple, with Simmons and Fitz carrying a [Cryo-Freeze Chamber](/wiki/Cryo-Freeze_Chamber), so they could put the past [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May) inside it, saving her from death. Once they were finished, they returned to the Quinjet and watched as the temple was destroyed right after their past selves traveled back in time. With the casual loop dealt with, the team made their way to the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse) to reclaim it from the [Chronicom Hunters](/wiki/Chronicom_Hunters) that were occupying it. Once inside, Rodriguez cleared the path from them, taking out a few of the Hunters, allowing them to reach the control room. Simmons' memory was still not entirely restored, but when listening to Rodriguez and Sousa talk about the ones they [cared](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) [about](/wiki/Quake), she finally remembered her daughter, and informed Fitz that she now knew what they were fighting for. While Fitz worked, the rest armed themselves with the [Chronicom Rifles](/wiki/Chronicom_Rifle) to protect him, as the Hunters attempted to breach the control room. Having completed their part of the mission, they all took cover, hoping that the team onboard the Chronicom ship would be successful and complete their mission before the Hunters would get to them. Soon, the Hunters entered the control room, but were stopped when the combined powers of May and [Kora](/wiki/Kora/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms) reprogrammed them to feel empathy, no longer making them enemies. Now that they had finally finished the mission, being victorious, Simmons and Fitz immediately rushed back to the temple, where they had left [Piper](/wiki/Piper) and [Flint](/wiki/Flint/Monolith_Recreation) to guard the [Containment Module](/wiki/Containment_Module), to retrieve their [daughter](/wiki/Alya_Fitz). Simmons opened the Module, and had a heartwarming reunion with Alya, having not seen her in a long time, and only just remembering her recently. Overwhelming happy to finally be done with the mission and be with her daughter, Simmons warmly hugged Alya. [[124]](#cite_note-AoS713-124) Retirement[ ] Resuming Family Life[ a lot.\" \"She's the best.\" \"She's learning to now.\" Jemma Simmons and [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson/Chronicom_LMD) [[src]](/wiki/What_We%27re_Fighting_For) With the [War Against the Chronicoms](/wiki/War_Against_the_Chronicoms) over, Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) decided to retire from [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.), so they could live a normal life together, as they raised their [daughter](/wiki/Alya_Fitz). The family moved into a house, and were able to spend all of their time with Alya, continuing to open her up to the world of science. As foreseen, the S.H.I.E.L.D. team never were in the same room all at once, especially with Simmons and Fitz being retired, however, they all still stayed in each other's lives, with Simmons and Fitz receiving many presents for Alya from their former teammates. And although she was retired, Simmons occasionally assisted [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) in secret, looking at and analysing different discoveries from her adventures in space. [[124]](#cite_note-AoS713-124) Virtual Reunion[ ] - \"I vote we make this a tradition.\" \"Yeah, I agree. We can't lose touch. We've been through too much together.\" - Jemma Simmons and together, they all decided to get together and catch up. However, with all of them being far away, including Simmons and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz) being retired, they used a virtual reality simulation. Simmons and Fitz, while having a picnic outside, entered the simulation, and joined the rest of the team as they all sat down in a circle, with Simmons liking the choice of venue being [The Krazy Kanoe](/wiki/The_Krazy_Kanoe). When [Alphonso Mackenzie](/wiki/Alphonso_Mackenzie) was the last to enter due to a situation he was dealing with, Simmons asked if it was worth telling, but he responded that it was classified, as she was no longer an agent. They proceeded to catch up about what each of them were all doing now since their last mission, with Simmons and Fitz talking about their retired life raising their [daughter](/wiki/Alya_Fitz), and the presents she was receiving from the others. Simmons mentioned a letter from [Daniel Sousa](/wiki/Daniel_Sousa/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms), which led to her asking [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson) about their relationship. Soon, some of the team were needed elsewhere, so they decided to end the gathering, but Simmons proposed that they make sure to meet up together as an annual tradition, which was unanimously agreed upon. The team took a moment to reflect on how all of them have been through so much, including many of them dying, as well as remembering [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw), which Simmons noted that they may still see him again. One by one, each of the team left, and before Simmons did, she told Johnson she'd send the anatomy analysis she received. Exiting the simulation, Simmons watched as Fitz played with their daughter, enjoying the life she now had. [[124]](#cite_note-AoS713-124) Personality[ ] - \"There's no getting home. Sooner you accept that the better. Survival's all that matters.\" \"I will not accept that. There's always hope.\" - [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/4,722_Hours) Jemma Simmons is known as the attractive nerd and also a science buff on her profile for [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) She has a normally calm and rational attitude, often relying on what is or isn't scientific fact. She is very forgiving, as seen when she so quickly forgave [Skye](/wiki/Skye) after she betrayed them with the [Rising Tide](/wiki/Rising_Tide). However, she did not forgive Grant Ward for his betrayal of the team. She has a deep affection towards [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), refusing to let him sacrifice his life for her. However, she briefly found being around Fitz hard because of the memories she has of the man he was before his brain was damaged. The two later resumed a normal relationship. Simmons was a terrible liar, proved many times over, prominently the instance in the [Hub](/wiki/Hub_(S.H.I.E.L.D._Facility)) when she shot Agent [Jasper Sitwell](/wiki/Jasper_Sitwell) with the [Night-Night Gun](/wiki/Night-Night_Gun) out of panic when he did not believe her lies. [[4]](#cite_note-AoS107-4) However, Simmons has improved on this flaw during her undercover assignment in HYDRA's science division. [[15]](#cite_note-AoS203-15) Simmons also has a bright outlook on life, most often trying to see the best in any situation, and then trying to make them better. The death of [Antoine Triplett](/wiki/Antoine_Triplett) drastically changed Simmons' views of superpowers and alien artifacts. She thought that the world was a better place without anyone with powers, to the point in almost saying that killing [Raina](/wiki/Raina), since she had powers, was the best option for the team. She viewed [Skye](/wiki/Skye) as being equal to [Hulk](/wiki/Hulk) in terms of destructive capability and lack of control; Simmons hoped to find a way to remove her powers permanently, or at least suppress them through sedatives. Her change of opinions was so surprising that Fitz himself said that her change in personality is almost scary. This change also brought out a darker side of Simmons' personality as she intended to kill [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward) with a [Splinter Bomb](/wiki/Splinter_Bomb) after all of his betrayals and while she failed due to [Sunil Bakshi](/wiki/Sunil_Bakshi)'s interference, she calmly told them that he didn't make it, not revealing his death was caused by her murder attempt. Her views would gradually soften after the S.H.I.E.L.D. Civil War, to the point of accusing Gonzales of starting a war with the Inhumans. Simmons has an attraction to men who act heroic, especially in regards to saving her. She was attracted to Ward after he saved her life when she attempted suicide; her closeness to Triplett grew when he defended her against [Victoria Hand](/wiki/Victoria_Hand) and her deceptive loyalty test. Simmons began an affair with [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels) after she lost hope that Fitz, the man who constantly risks his well-being on her behalf, would save her. However, Fitz did save her, causing a conundrum for her emotionally. However, after a mission when she confronted [Hive](/wiki/Hive) and moved on Daniels' death, Simmons finally consummated a relationship with Fitz. Although it took some time for Simmons to admit her feelings towards Fitz, she is deeply committed in their relationship, planning romantic getaways and actively looking for a place where they could live together. She also never gave up on saving her boyfriend from the [Framework](/wiki/Framework), saying that she loved him on multiple occasions, despite Fitz being a cruel and ruthless [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA/Framework) officer in the alternate reality. After learning that [Deke Shaw](/wiki/Deke_Shaw) is her grandson and hearing that [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez) met her future self, Simmons developed the belief that she and Fitz were invincible if they were predestined to end up at the [Lighthouse](/wiki/Lighthouse). Her belief was further reinforced when she avoided purposely drinking a toxic substance by sheer chance and when Rodriguez accidentally shot between her and Fitz. Abilities[ ] - \"Simmons is probably smarter, technically, but that's because she likes homework more than life itself.\" - [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)to PhDs in biochemistry by the time she was 17, and continued her studies at the [S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Science and Technology](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D._Academy_of_Science_and_Technology). She graduated as one of the youngest cadets in the history of the Academy due to her intellect. Simmons possesses a sharp and bright mind, focused on analysis, that has allowed her to research and develop many breakthrough equipment for [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.) - Master Scientist: Simmons' expertise in the field of biochemistry has allowed her to work in the research and development of many breakthrough discoveries, such as the use of dendrotoxin as a tranquilizer ammunition, the cure for a [virus](/wiki/Chitauri_Virus)of extraterrestrial origin, a crystalline nucleation process capable of turning moisture into ice or an odorless scent used for tracking. She is highly gifted and knowledgeable in many fields of science practiced such as biology, biochemistry, anatomy and physics. - Master Physician: Simmons was often charged with evaluating and treating any injuries sustained by her teammates and colleagues, being skilled enough to apply advanced first aid to [Skye](/wiki/Skye)when she was shot by [Ian Quinn](/wiki/Ian_Quinn), and to perform an autopsy on [Eric Koenig](/wiki/Eric_Koenig)'s corpse. Her medical skills extend to surgery, as she was able to save [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez)after she had her arms cut off by [Ruby Hale](/wiki/Ruby_Hale). Simmons' training and experience with S.H.I.E.L.D. provided her with extensive knowledge of human, animal and alien physiology, anatomy and DNA when needed even beating out scientists, physicians and terrorist agencies ahead of time. One of the aliens that she encountered was the [Inhuman](/wiki/Inhumans), [Lucio](/wiki/Lucio). Simmons had to cut an incision in his head to expose his brain during his autopsy. She also was able to perform surgery on [Akela Amador](/wiki/Akela_Amador)in order to take out her [Backscatter X-Ray Eye Implant](/wiki/Backscatter_X-Ray_Eye_Implant). - Combatant: After joining [Coulson's Team](/wiki/Coulson%27s_Team), Simmons eventually learned how to become an adept combatant, in order to be able to fend for herself. When stopping [Hive](/wiki/Hive), Simmons was able to take on a super-strong [Primitive](/wiki/Primitives)with relative ease, using a [crowbar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowbar_(tool)), as well as an assist from her team. During her journey in space, Simmons proved herself to be very confident in her ability to fight and was able to free herself from being held at gunpoint by [Izel's Crew](/wiki/Izel%27s_Crew)and even stealing the gun off of her enemy. - \"Someone's being practicing.\" \"You know I don't like guns, but I'd rather be prepared.\" - [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May)and Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Watchdogs_(episode)) - Expert Marksman: Simmons was able to handle a gun with ease when she mistook [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)for an intruder in her apartment while on her undercover assignment within HYDRA. She hit [Raina](/wiki/Raina)multiple times when Raina attacked scientists under Simmons' charge. [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May)began subtly training Simmons in her marksmanship by teaching her breathing techniques and giving her self-confidence in handling a firearm. Simmons became accurate enough to shoot [Hive's recreation](/wiki/Hive/Monolith_Recreation)in the head with her sidearm. - \"You're not a very good liar, are you?\" - [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse)to Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/A_Hen_in_the_Wolf_House) - Expert Spy: Originally, Coulson did not trust Simmons as a spy, considering her lying skills were subpar; he had Simmons give support to [Melinda May](/wiki/Melinda_May)when she went undercover into [Cybertek Corporate Headquarters](/wiki/Cybertek_Corporate_Headquarters). As Simmons learned to lie better, Coulson sent her to [HYDRA Laboratories](/wiki/HYDRA_Laboratories)to gain information on the organization's schemes, operations and research managing to fool her direct co-workers and even [Sunil Bakshi](/wiki/Sunil_Bakshi). She only got discovered when [Raina](/wiki/Raina)blew her cover. Over time, she learned to use her apparent naivety as a tool, even tricking [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse)while the [Playground](/wiki/Playground)was [under attack](/wiki/Attack_on_the_Playground). - Chamber](/wiki/Cryo-Freeze_Chamber).\"\" \"You learned to read alien?\" - Jemma Simmons and [Piper](/wiki/Piper) [[src]](/wiki/Missing_Pieces) - Multilingualism: Simmons fluently speaks her native British-dialect English as well as some Spanish, French and German. She was also able to learn alien languages within a few months, such as Aeonian. Equipment[ ] - \"And, since I'm practically the only woman here who can't kill with her bare hands...\" - Jemma Simmons [[src]](/wiki/Watchdogs_(episode)) Weapons[ ] [Night-Night Pistol](/wiki/Night-Night_Gun): Simmons helped [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)on the design of the original Night-Night Gun, by creating the dendrotoxin rounds used as ammunition, and began to carry one of the pistols in her purse. She accidentally used it to shoot [Jasper Sitwell](/wiki/Jasper_Sitwell)when she was in a restricted area of the [Hub](/wiki/Hub_(S.H.I.E.L.D._Facility)), and then again during the mission in a train through [Italy](/wiki/Italy), shooting at her teammates as she regained consciousness from being affected by a [Dendrotoxin Grenade](/wiki/Dendrotoxin_Grenade). [I.C.E.R.](/wiki/I.C.E.R.): Simmons, along with the rest of [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)began to use I.C.E.R.s in replacement of the [Night-Night Guns](/wiki/Night-Night_Gun)as the primary weapon on many missions. Simmons used an I.C.E.R. to fend off [Calvin Zabo](/wiki/Calvin_Zabo)when he transformed, as well as to knock out [Aida](/wiki/Aida)in fear of potential danger. [SIG Sauer P226](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIG_Sauer_P226): Simmons carried one of these guns during her undercover assignment within [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA), and grabbed it when she mistook [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)for an intruder in her apartment. [Smith & Wesson M&P](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson_M%26P): The Smith & Wesson M&P pistol is the standard sidearm carried by [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)agents, and, as such, Simmons was issued with one of these to protect herself when examining the remains of the [Kree City](/wiki/Kree_City)under [Puerto Rico](/wiki/Puerto_Rico). She used it to shoot at [Raina](/wiki/Raina), but she managed to withstand the bullets. Simmons also took it to hold and unconscious [Bobbi Morse](/wiki/Bobbi_Morse)when it was revealed that she had infiltrated the [Playground](/wiki/Playground)as a member of the [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)faction led by [Robert Gonzales](/wiki/Robert_Gonzales). She trained hard with the weapon after she was ridden with guilt because she had to free [Lash](/wiki/Lash)to protect her from [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA), resulting in the death of many [Inhumans](/wiki/Inhumans). She became confident enough to shoot [Hive](/wiki/Hive)in the stomach when he approached her as [Will Daniels](/wiki/Will_Daniels). Simmons pointed a gun at [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Life-Model_Decoy)as she realized that he had been replaced by an LMD, however, he was able to convince her enough to approach and avoid her shoots and knock her down. Within the [Framework](/wiki/Framework), Simmons took one of the guns from the [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D./Framework)arsenal to confront [Alistair Fitz](/wiki/Alistair_Fitz/Framework)at his house, and ended up accidentally shooting him in the stomach in a struggle, killing him. Simmons carried the gun during her \"honeymoon\", a mission to the [HYDRA Herefordshire Facility](/wiki/HYDRA_Herefordshire_Facility)where she Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth)engaged in a shootout against the [Sleeper Mechs](/wiki/Sleeper_Mechs)guarding the facility, until they went offline. As part of the arsenal on [Zephyr One](/wiki/Zephyr_One)during [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)'s mission to [locate](/wiki/Search_for_Leo_Fitz)a stranded [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), Simmons resorted to use it against the enemies they came across, having to surrender it during an inspection at [Naro-Atzia](/wiki/Naro-Atzia)before trying to retrieve it to confront [Malachi](/wiki/Malachi), using it to threaten [Boyle](/wiki/Boyle)and [Toad](/wiki/Toad)into revealing Fitz's whereabouts, and preparing for a final stand with Piper and Davis before being captured by the Chronicoms led by [Atarah](/wiki/Atarah). [FN Five-seveN USG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FN_Five-seveN): Simmons and [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)took two [Quinjet](/wiki/Quinjet)they used to travel to [Ogygia](/wiki/Ogygia)with [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward/Framework). Both of them used it to threaten Radcliffe](/wiki/Holden_Radcliffe)but had to hide when [Madame Hydra](/wiki/Madame_Hydra)and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)arrived to the island. [Heckler & Koch MP5A3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_MP5): Simmons retrieved one of these weapons from the arsenal in the [Playground](/wiki/Playground)to defend herself from the [Life-Model Decoys](/wiki/Life-Model_Decoy), that [sieged](/wiki/Siege_of_the_Playground)the base, and threatened [Piper](/wiki/Piper), [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis)and [Prince](/wiki/Prince)with it to force their cooperation, as they believed she was actually the LMD. [Heckler & Koch MP5K-PDW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_%26_Koch_MP5): Simmons took one of these submachine guns from the [Playground](/wiki/Playground)in order to confront [Aida](/wiki/Aida). Despite knowing that the weapon would not be effective against her, Simmons nevertheless used it both for revenge and as a distraction. [M26 Grenade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M26_grenade): Simmons took a grenade with the intention of blowing up everything related to the Framework and the brain scans of the people who were uploaded into it, to avoid them to fall into the [Chronicom Hunters](/wiki/Chronicom_Hunters)' hands. However, [Enoch](/wiki/Enoch)put the ring back on the grenade to prevent its explosion and rescue his friends. [Splinter Bomb](/wiki/Splinter_Bomb): Simmons kept a case of the Splinters Bombs that [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA)developed as a means of weaponizing the effects of the [Diviner](/wiki/Diviner), and took one with her during a rescue [mission](/wiki/Attack_on_the_Arctic_HYDRA_Research_Facility)to a HYDRA [base](/wiki/Arctic_HYDRA_Research_Facility)in the [Arctic](/wiki/Arctic), hoping to use it to kill [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward). She tried to ambush Ward, but [Sunil Bakshi](/wiki/Sunil_Bakshi), who was working for him, attacked Simmons and ended up being killed by the Splinter Bomb. [Taser Pin](/wiki/Taser_Pin): Simmons used a Taser Pin during her undercover mission in Senator [Ellen Nadeer](/wiki/Ellen_Nadeer)'s office. Other Equipment[ ] [D.W.A.R.F.s](/wiki/D.W.A.R.F.s); Simmons often used the D.W.A.R.F.s in order to analyze and retrieve forensic data during his field missions, such as in the [Centipede](/wiki/Centipede_Project)laboratory in [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles), the temple where an [0-8-4](/wiki/Peruvian_0-8-4)was located in [Peru](/wiki/Peru)or the barn where [Frank Whalen](/wiki/Frank_Whalen)'s corpse was found floating, [Full-Spectrum Goggles](/wiki/Full-Spectrum_Goggles): A set of goggles designed by her partner [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), that Simmons was wearing to investigate the location where [Franklin Hall](/wiki/Franklin_Hall)was kidnapped. [Electro-Static Field Scanner](/wiki/Electro-Static_Field_Scanner): Simmons used it in conjunction with the [Full-Spectrum Goggles](/wiki/Full-Spectrum_Goggles)in Colorado, but the scanner activated one of the [Gravity Field Generators](/wiki/Gravity_Field_Generator)that were used to kidnap [Franklin Hall](/wiki/Franklin_Hall). [Anti-Serum Delivery Mechanism](/wiki/Anti-Serum_Delivery_Mechanism): [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)developed this device against the clock to deliver the anti-serum Simmons developed to cure the [Chitauri Virus](/wiki/Chitauri_Virus)she had contracted, applying it on lab rats before being able to apply it on herself. [Paranasal Extraction Unit](/wiki/Paranasal_Extraction_Unit): To retrieve the intel that Agent [Shaw](/wiki/Shaw_(Agent))gathered in [Siberia](/wiki/Siberia), Simmons had to extract it from his skull through his nasal cavity, using this device to perform the uncomfortable maneuver. [Spectrographic Analyzer](/wiki/Spectrographic_Analyzer): During an investigation in [Trillemarka National Park](/wiki/Trillemarka_National_Park), Simmons had to analyze the spectrographic signatures of a curious marking inside a fallen tree, quickly realizing that they had an extraterrestrial origin even before [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz)determined they were of [Asgardian](/wiki/Asgard)origin. [Three Dimensional Scanner](/wiki/Three_Dimensional_Scanner): Simmons resorted to use the scanner for a three-dimensional restoration of the imprints inside the tree in [Trillemarka National Park](/wiki/Trillemarka_National_Park), [Flex Screen](/wiki/Flex_Screen): Simmons kept a Flex Screen during her undercover assignment to infiltrate [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA), as a means of contacting Director [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)in case of need, but she had to get rid of it when HYDRA realized they had a spy within its ranks. - Upgraded Cell Phone: Simmons has a specially made cell phone containing an upgraded battery created by [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz). The upgraded battery allowed the phone to last for weeks without a charge. [Framework Headset](/wiki/Framework_Headset): In order to save [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)and stop [Aida](/wiki/Aida), Simmons and [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)put on the headset to transfer their minds into the [Framework](/wiki/Framework). With the dangers of the headset, [Piper](/wiki/Piper), [James Davis](/wiki/James_Davis), [Prince](/wiki/Prince), and [Yo-Yo Rodriguez](/wiki/Yo-Yo_Rodriguez)had to stay by their sides. They were tasked with not removing the two from the Framework, no matter how bad their vitals got. [Silencing Implant](/wiki/Silencing_Implant): While enslaved by [Kasius](/wiki/Kasius)in Destroyed Earth, Simmons was fit with an implant. The implant made Simmons deaf while at the click of a button, Kasius could let her hear him and only him.

This was crucial just in case Simmons was captured by the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms). This way, the Chronicoms could not find where Fitz was. However, [Nathaniel Malick](/wiki/Nathaniel_Malick/History_Altered_by_Chronicoms)'s endless searching through her brain caused D.I.A.N.A. to act up, temporarily making Simmons forget everything and everyone.

Academy of Science and Technology](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D._Academy_of_Science_and_Technology): Simmons studied at the [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)Academy of Science and Technology, where she was quickly known as one of the most promising students.

She notably stayed there while two of her teammates completed a mission in [South Ossetia](/wiki/South_Ossetia). She later worked in the Hub's laboratories to analyze the properties of [GH.325](/wiki/GH.325). Shortly afterwards, the [HYDRA Uprising](/wiki/HYDRA_Uprising)erupted, trapping Simmons in the Hub alongside [Antoine Triplett](/wiki/Antoine_Triplett).

Thanks to [Daisy Johnson](/wiki/Daisy_Johnson)and [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz/Destroyed_Earth), Simmons was able to escape from the Lighthouse. Once back into her time, Simmons stayed at the Lighthouse with her [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D.)teammates, even marrying Fitz in a forest which had manifested in the facility. Working at the base's lab, she notably worked with Fitz in order to create a cure for [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson)by combining the [Centipede Serum](/wiki/Centipede_Serum)with [Jiaying](/wiki/Jiaying)'s DNA. Once she returned from her long mission to [find](/wiki/Search_for_Leo_Fitz)the other [Leo Fitz](/wiki/Leo_Fitz), she continued to operate in the Lighthouse, mainly in the lab, until it was [taken over](/wiki/Ambush_at_the_Lighthouse)by the [Chronicoms](/wiki/Chronicoms).

In the Framework[ ] [Playground](/wiki/Playground): Along with [Phil Coulson](/wiki/Phil_Coulson), Simmons was granted access to the Playground, the only remaining [S.H.I.E.L.D.](/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D./Framework)facility, thanks to [Grant Ward](/wiki/Grant_Ward), and was allowed to stay there to hide from [HYDRA](/wiki/HYDRA), even though the [Patriot](/wiki/Patriot)remained quite suspicious about her presence in his base.
