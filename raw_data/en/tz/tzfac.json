The shifting on diet pattern, unbalancing in energy consumption and shifting physical activities have made this problem increased in the prevalence and is a concern in health problem completion. The problem in obesity has estimated to be a major death by 2025. The gut microbiome has known to affect the immune, gastrointestinal, nervous and cardiovascular system and even they could alter the host metabolism and triggered metabolic syndrome, like obesity. The two major phyla of the gut microbiome, Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes, have known to alter in obese individuals compared with the healthy ones and the composition would change during the different diet pattern given. Indonesian local yam identified to contain high insoluble and soluble fibre that would be fermented by the microbiome in the gut host and be a specific nutrient into gut microbiome. Therefore, we would like to compare the gut microbiome composition in obese individuals supplemented by Indonesia local yam as a tested snack with obese individuals supplemented by wheat flour as a standard snack. High-throughput screening method by realtime qPCR was used to observe the gut microbiome composition, Bacteriodetes and Firmicutes phyla, Bifidobacterium spp. Cq values further were normalized by All Bacteria as the reference. We compared Cq before and after the intervention and using paired sample t-test to analyse the significant difference. Our result found that obese individual supplemented by tested snack, composing by Indonesia local yam showed increasing significantly in Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale groups (p<0.05). Finally, we suspect that Indonesian local yam could have the specific prebiotic function to modulate specific gut microbiome related to improving gut microbiota composition in obese individuals. groups 1Holeta Bee Research Center, Ethiopia 2Center for Environmental Science, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia Low quality of honey product from different parts of the country leads to high challenges on export market and hence low export earnings. As a part of solution to this problem, investigation on honey samples collected from Gesha and Sayilem districts of the Kaffa Zone, Ethiopia was conducted to identify the quality of the product from the study areas against national and international standards. Assessment of bee forage based on field inventory, pollen load collection using pollen trap and pollen analysis indicated that 79 bee forages with the major pollen count belongs to Schefflera abyssinica, Croton macrostachyus 96%, 478.2-58.7% and 33.92-64.4% respectively. The results of analyzed honey samples from the areas for moisture, sucrose, glucose and fructose content, shows that 19.5 g/100 g, 69.48 g/100 g, 38.6 g/100 g and 35.5 g/100g, respectively. Similarly, proline, pH, free acid and HMF values, electrical conductivity and invertase activity of the honey also shows that 210.1 g/100g, 4.05g/100 g, 7 meq/kg, 1.23.87 mg/100g and 0.16 mS/cm, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between moisture content and electrical conductivity (r = 0.76, p < 0.01).The study found thet all analyzed parameters of the honey samples meet the basic honey quality standards both national and international specifications.

Anemia, particularly iron deficiency anemia, is the most common hematological disorder during pregnancy and results in adverse women and fetal consequences. Nevertheless, there was a paucity of information on utilization and compliance with iron supplementation and associated factors during pregnancy in low-income countries like Ethiopia. The objective of this study was to assess utilization and compliance with iron supplementation and associated factors among pregnant women. Methods: A community based cross sectional study was used among randomly selected 445 pregnant women attending antenatal care at health facility in the study area. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire. Binary logistic regression analyses were done to see the association between each independent variable and the outcome variable. All variables with a p value of < 0.25 were entered into final model to control for all possible confounders. Odds ratios along with 95% CI were estimated to identify predictors of the outcome variable using multivariable logistic regression analyses. Level of statistical significance was declared at p - value less than 0.05. Results: About 54%; 95% 2.2% (95% CI = (1.1-3.6) of women received iron supplements during first, second, third and fourth antenatal care visits respectively. The level of compliance with iron supplements was found to be 92.4%; 95% CI = (89.9-94.6). Having formal education [AOR 3.77; 95% CI = (1.33-10.69)] , not experiencing discomfort related to iron supplements intake [AOR = 2.94; 95% CI = (1.17-7.39)], having comprehensive knowledge about anemia [AOR = 2.62; 95% CI = (1.02-6.70)], being knowledgeable supplementation [AOR = 3.30; 95% CI = (1.12-9.76)], having information about importance of iron supplementation during pregnancy [AOR = 2.86 ; 95% CI = (1.04-7.87)] and ever being visited by urban health extension workers [AOR = 0.31; 95% CI = (0.12-0.83)] were significantly associated with compliance with iron supplementation during pregnancy. Conclusions: The utilization of iron supplementation during pregnancy was low with high level of compliance with the supplements, maternal formal education, improved wealth index, having knowledge about anemia and importance of iron supplements during pregnancy, not experiencing side effects related to iron tablets and getting iron for free have positively influenced compliance with iron supplementation during pregnancy. Thus, comprehensive nutrition education and provision of iron supplements are crucial tools to increase utilization and compliance with iron supplementation during pregnancy.

Conventional animals protein source including, beef, chicken and others may be in-sufficient to meet this present need. Edible insect like Gonimbrasiabelina (mopane worm) showed great potential as alternative source of protein, especially for protein deficiency populace. This study aims to compare the proximate, mineral and functional composition of protein isolates, defatted and raw samples of mopane worm. The proximate, mineral composition and functional properties of the samples were determined using standard protocols. The result revealed variations in parameters investigated. The proximate analysis showed that protein isolate possessed the highest protein content (81.75 %), ash (5.17 %), crude fibre content (5.53 %) and lowest fat (0.36 %) and moisture (6.34 %) content, in comparison with other samples (defatted and raw). Similarly, the protein isolates also exhibited highest foam stability (64.38 %), foam capacity (24.39 %), swelling index (0.74), emulsion capacity (64.38 %) and lowest bulk density (0.13 %) in comparison with other samples. Interestingly, the protein isolates also showed significant (p< 0.05) better magnesium and potassium content than other samples. Therefore, the protein isolates could serve as a preferable remedy in the management of protein-energy malnutrition, as well as used in food fortification for the food industry. For future studies, anti-nutrient properties of samples need to be ascertained.

Osmania University, India C allosobruchus chinensis is one of the harmful serious pests in stored grain and related products. The attack of stored products of agricultural and animal origin by more than 600 species of beetle pests causing quantitative and qualitative losses, as well as insect contamination in food commodities, is an important quality control problem that is of great concern to food industries. It is reported that insect damage in stored grains and pulses may amount to 10-40% in countries where modern storage technologies have not been introduced. It is therefore necessary to reduce such losses by controlling pests in stored products. The crude pepper seeds are toxic to Sitophilus oryzae (L.) and Rhyzopertha dominica (F.). It is considered a Primary pest, which can easily infest damaged or broken kernels and apart from grain, it is particularly destructive to Rice and other processed grain products. During the last two decades phytochemicals from plant bioresources have been heralded as desirable alternative to synthetic chemical insecticides for pest management because they pose little threat to the environment or human health. In our earlier studies, we reported the effect of commercial glycoalkaloid, Vitex negundo on Callosobruchus chinensis larvae. The treatment prevented the normal development of the last instar larvae. Increase in dosage of Vitex negundo resulted in mosaics (larval-pupal, pupal-adult intermediates), deformed pupae and deformed adults. However, the molecular mechanism of the phytochemical effect on the larvae is yet to be studied. Lindsey C. Perkin corresponding and Brenda Oppert in recently reported the list of genes that are altered during developmental stages (PMID: 31198628). We planned to isolate the RNA from the different growth stages of the food pest and study their expression pattern after the treatment of Vitex negundo. Dr. M.

Gandhigram Rural Institute, India Xylooligosaccharides are potential prebiotic components retrieved from xylan using xylanase enzyme which are stable over a wide range of pH and temperature. According to the biological properties, they are non-carcinogenic, selective proliferation of Probiotics, antioxidant etc. Probiotics are live microorganism which confers health benefits to the consumed host viz., reduces the serum cholesterol level, alleviation of lactose intolerance symptoms, lowering the risk of colon cancer etc. The synergistic combination of Prebiotics and Probiotics doubles the health benefits when they are consumed. Synbiotics implants and improves the survival of gut microbiome population, enhances the production of Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) etc. In this study, the Xylooligosaccharides (XOS) were produced from the agricultural waste, sugarcane bagasse by two step process: Alkaline extraction of xylan from substrate and the enzymatic hydrolysis of xylan. XOSs are combined with the probiotics isolated from fermented Soybean, Fish and Koozh. XOS was substituted with carbon source of the medium and their growth was maximum when compared with the actual medium. In XOS substituted medium, the bacteriocin produced by Bifidobacterium B (360 AU) inhibits the P. aeroginosa and Lactobacillus FN1 inhibits the growth of P. fluroscence, E. coli and P. aeroginosa (643 AU, 1320 AU, 1929 AU). The demands on the advancement of value added nutraceutical food products coupled with health benefits attract attention worldwide. This demand may be retrieved by the usage of Synbiotics.

Yogurts, milk, frozen yogurts and ice cream are enriched by adding probiotic organisms in countries like Japan, USA, Australia and Europe. Probiotics are generally mono or mixed cultures of live microorganisms which form the major component of the gut flora (e.g., Lactobacilli, Bifidobacteria). Probiotics, when ingested beneficially, affect the host by replenishing the depleted gut microflora, which may have occurred due to the use of antibiotics, illness and stress, travel or lifestyle changes and also by improving the properties of the indigenous microflora of the host. Microbial strains for probiotic use must be representative of microorganisms that are generally recognized as safe microbes. In the present study, efforts were made for preparing Lactobacillus biomass using cheese whey as nutrient medium for generating the probiotic culture. Efforts have been made to replace MRS medium with cheese whey powder for growing Lactobacillus culture. Using 30% (w/v) cheese whey powder as nutrient medium, we are able to obtain 0.1 kg Lactobacillus biomass per litre of nutrient medium. Biography: Sourish Bhattacharya has completed his B.

Ethiopia Meat and Dairy Industry Development Institute, Ethiopia Raw honey after harvesting is usually strained and filtered to remove suspended materials including pollen, proplis and bee wax prior to heating for commercial processing. Heating honey is to facilitate filtering and bottling of honey by reducing the viscosity. In commercial processing plant, honey is usually heated in order to purify, filter, facilitate packaging to inhibit microorganism growth, to reduce the moisture content at the standard level and to delay crystallization process. Even though heating is of great important in commercial honey processing, no guideline is available till to date for the use of heating temperature and time combination based on types and origin of honey. The optimal heating conditions are mainly relied on the geographical and botanical origins of honey. Uncontrolled temperature can be detrimental to the quality of honey and to its biological and bio active chemical properties. In Ethiopia, commercial honey processing industries can perform their processes in a different ways depending on various factors, including economic, technological and technique reasons. Honey has a probability to loss the natural quality when it goes through uncontrolled thermal processing. The loss of the natural quality is due to the decomposition of vitamins, destruction of the integrity of the enzymes and the development HFM content. HMF content and enzymatic activities are the recognized honey quality parameters to penetrate and sustain in the international market. As heating is of great important on commercial honey processing industry, it needs to have standard guideline for the use of optimum heating temperature and time duration.

Let's not forget that many molecules such as polyphenols and anthocyanins in wine bring a lot of health benefits. The objective of this study is the total dealcoholization of wine according to two different techniques tested for the first time, which are vacuum evaporation carried out at three different temperatures (40\u00b0C, 50\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C) and lyophilization, with the preservation as much as possible of the quality of our product. For the results, several factors such as alcohol concentration, IPT, IC, total polyphenols, total tannins and antioxidant activity were analyzed according to the different dealcoholization techniques. All the processes made it possible to obtain totally dealcoholized wines (alcohol content less than 0.5%). Concerning phenolic compounds, the dealcoholization techniques did not result in a significant decrease of these compounds compared to the initial wine. The analysis by GC-MS of the aromas showed a high decrease in the aromas' concentrations. A questionnaire was conducted among 200 people to analyze the acceptability of the consumer vis-\u00e0-vis non-alcoholic wines. The results showed that a significant portion of the population is interested in this type of product.

The pulp is a good source of oil essential for dietary and cosmetic manufacturing. Pilipomace is a by-product of pili pulp oil production which consists of peel and pulp usually discarded as animal feed and wastes. This study aimed to determine the potential functional properties of oven dried pilipomace powder (PPP). In this work, pilipomace was utilized into powder through oven drying for 22 hours at 60\u00b0C. Proximate composition and dietary fiber of PPP were analyzed using AOAC standards. Phytonutrient content and antioxidant activity of PPP were also determined. Results showed that PPP contains 7.9% crude ash, 7.7 moisture, 5.4% crude protein, 23.1% crude fat and 55.9% total carbohydrates. It is an excellent source of dietary fiber (45.9 g/100g) with significant amounts of phytonutrients: total polyphenols (11.3 mg GAE/g), total anthocyanin (1230.8 and total flavonoids (9.7 mg RHE/g). Its antioxidant capacity were determined by FRAP (13.4 mg TE/g) and DPPH (17.6 mg TE/g). Safety assessment through microbiological analysis showed that PPP were in safe levels (7.5x103 APC, <10 E. coli and 4.5 x 103 Yeast and Molds count). Physicochemical analysis showed that PPP has moderate pH (4.46 pH) and low water activity (0.47 Aw) indicating that PPP is less susceptible to spoilage under good storage condition. In conclusion, this study show the potential of PPP as a functional food ingredient which can be utilized in various food applications. Biography: Ana Teresa L.

This indicates that the VKSU drying device and the developed technology provide effective results. National Institute of Nutrition (ICMR), India Introduction: Diabetes mellitus comprises a group of metabolic disorders that share the feature of hyperglycaemia. It is worldwide in distribution and the incidence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is rising dramatically. Globally, diabetes is one of the most common non-communicable diseases leading to mortally and morbidity in many developed countries. The increased risk has been attributed to the high prevalence of multiple atherosclerotic risk factors among diabetic patients. Few studies were found the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) as a treatment for diabetes especially in experimental animals, despite the evidence showing that they have the potential to reduce the incidence of diabetes. This study was conducted to find out the association of dietary pattern and CVD risk factors, among recently diagnosed as Pre- diabetes subjects. This is a hospital based cross-sectional and case-control study with newly diagnose Pre- diabetes, aged 20-50yrs, of both sexes. Out of 75 subjects screened only 24 subjects were recruited as pre diabetes based on their HbA1c values (DCCT-5.7 to 6.5%) from the outpatient department of Osmania General Hospital Hyderabad, India. The various biochemical parameters viz Fasting blood glucose values, HbA1c (glycated Hb) Lipid profile, i.e., Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol were analysed using commercially available kits. Conclusions: Our results indicate that there were significant changes in the values of HbA1c, Fasting blood glucose, Total cholesterol, Triglycerides etc. upon probiotic supplementation for a period of 30 days in the Pre-Diabetes subjects compared to non-supplemented control group. From this study we could conclude that the probiotic curd supplementation may prevent the progression of Pre diabetes to diabetes mellitus.
