The social studies standards were adopted into rule on May 6, 2013 and became effective May 13, 2013. These standards must be implemented by schools no later than the 2013 -2014 school year. For further information, please refer to the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) docu ment for the 2011 Minnesota K -12 Academic Standards in Social Studies . View the FAQ on the Minnesota Department of Education website (http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/EdExc/StanCurri/K - 12AcademicStandards/SocialStudies/index.html ). Figure 1: 2011 Minnesota Social Studies Standards \"At a Glance\" Page 2 of 151 May 6, 2013 Introduction The 2011 Minnesota K -12 Academic Standards in Social Studies set the statewide expectations for K -12 student achievement in the disciplines of citizenship and government, economics, geography and history (United States and world). The 2011 standards are guided by a vision of citizenship and college- and career -readiness. As required by law, the standards identify the academic knowledge and skills that prepare students for postsecondary education, work , and civic life in the 21st century (Minn. Stat. \u00a7 120B.021, Subd.4). In order to meet this vision, the standards r equire students to understand the facts, concepts, principles and perspectives that shape the social studies disciplines. Students need deep knowledge of this information in order to make sense of their world. In addition to mastering a body of knowledge, students must be able to apply their understanding to complex situations and contexts, some of which are yet to be envisioned. To prepare for these future challenges, the standards also require students to think critically about important issues and communicate their findings, and engage in the processes of problem solving and discipline- based inquiry. The social studies standards represent the required social studies disciplines addressed in state statute (Minn. Stat. \u00a7 120B.021, Subd.1). Students must rec eive instruction in these four disciplines so that they are able to satisfactorily complete the state standards (and the benchmarks which supplement the standards). The 2011 Minnesota K-12 Academic Standards in Social Studies represent the minimum requirem ents that must be addressed by the school curriculum, rather than the curriculum in its entirety. Additional social studies disciplines not represented in the standards, such as psychology, sociology, archeology and anthropology, have strong traditions of instruction in Minnesota schools. Schools may choose to continue offering courses in these disciplines as local traditions, interest and school priorities dictate. Page 3 of 151 May 6, 2013 Figure 2: K -12 Sequence of Study Page 4 of 151 May 6, 2013 K-12 Overview of the Social Studies Standards The following are brief summaries of the standards in the primary grades, intermediate and middle school grades, and high school. Figure 2 illustrates the disciplinary focus at each grade level from kindergarten through high school. At any grade level, the benchmarks from multiple disciplines can be combined to facilitate integrated, or interdisciplinary, learning experiences. This is an example from grade 8 Global Studies: Students study the human and physical characteristics of Singapore (geography), and the political challenges that ultimately led to the establishment of the Republic of Singapore (history) while reinforcing their understanding of nation- building (citizenship and government) and the concept of comparative advantage in global trade (economics). Primary Grades Figure 3: Overview of Social Studies in Grades K -3 The standards in kindergarten through grade 3 require students to master fundamental understandings that prepare them for in- depth study of history, geography, economics, and civics and government later on. These understandings include concepts associated with familiar local environments and current times to faraway places and distant times. In addition to learning key concepts, students begin to apply essential disciplinary skills including civics skills, geospatial skills, economic reasoning and historical inquiry. Content in the early grades is balanced among the four social studies disciplines with no single discipline emphasized over another. Page 5 of 151 May 6, 2013 Intermediate and Middle Grades Figure 4: Overview of Social Studies in Grades 4- 8 In grades 4 through 8, students are introduced to a disciplinary focus with a \"lead discipline \" that frames the social studies for that grade level. (The lead discipline for each grade level is described below.) Core concepts from the other three disciplines provide complementary perspectives that promote an integrated understanding of the content. Although there are designated l ead and supporting disciplines, the importance of integration should be emphasized: One cannot truly understand history content, for example, without considering the relevant economic, political and geographic factors. In grade 4, students focus on the Geography of North America. In grade 5, they study the History of North America up to 1800. From this foundation, the context for learning moves from local to global. Beginning with Minnesota Studies in grade 6, students learn about state history and governm ent and Minnesota's role within the larger context of the country. This is f ollowed by United States Studies in grade 7, when students study the country's history and government from 1800 to contemporary times. Social studies in the middle grades culminates in the interdisciplinary learning experiences of Global Studies in grade 8. Students apply spatial and chronological perspectives as they study the geography of the world's regions and contemporary world history. Page 6 of 151 May 6, 2013 High School Figure 5: Overview of Social Studies in Grades 9- 12 Students in high school (grades 9 -12) pursue in- depth study of social studies content that equips them with the knowledge and skills required for success in postsecondary education (i.e., freshman -level courses), the skilled w orkplace and civic life. The amount of content in the standards corresponds to the graduation credit requirements identified in state statutes : Three and one- half (3.5) credits of social studies encompassing at least Uni ted States history, geography, government and citizenship, world history, and economics sufficient to satisfy all of the academ ic standards in social studies. (Minn. Stat. \u00a7 120B.024, Subd. 1(5)). A one- half credit of economics taught in a school's agriculture education or business department may fulfill a one- half credit in social studies...if the credit is sufficient to satisfy all of the academic standards in economics. (Minn. Stat. \u00a7 120B.024 Subd. 2(a)) . Approximately one year (or two semesters) of content is provided for a survey of United States history, a year for a survey of world history, and a half -year (or one semester) each for geography, government and citizenship, and economics. Although the standards in this document are organized by discipline, they may be delivered in an interdisciplinary context. Page 7 of 151 May 6, 2013 Organization of the Standards The social studies content in this document is organized into strands, substrands , standards and benchmarks. The broadest level of organization at each grade level is represented by the four disciplinary strands : 1) Citizenship and Government; 2) Economics; 3) Geography; and, 4) History. The content for each strand is organized into s everal categories or substrands . The first substrand in each discipline indicates key skills or processes that, in most cases, should be applied to the content in other benchmarks rather than taught as a standalone item. For example, students could learn about the powers and operations of local government in Minnesota (content from benchmark 9.1.4.6.8) while doing a project about a local policy issue (civic skills from benchmark 9.1.1.1.4). Each substrand contains 10 to 23 standards . A standard is \"a summar y description of student learning...\" or broad statements of skills and understandings that students must complete for career -and college- readiness and advanced d or \"anchored\" in college- and career -readiness. Because they represent the \"big picture,\" they are repeated at multiple grade levels. Each anchor standard is composed of one or more grade -level benchmark s. A benchmark is written as a learning outcome\u2014\" the specific knowledge or skill that a student must master to complete part of an academic standard by the end of the grade level or grade band.\" (Minn. Stat. \u00a7 120B.018 , Subd. 3). Benchmarks are unique to each grade level and represent the learning that is to be mastered by the end of a particular grade (in grades K -8) or grade band (in grades 9 -12). The benchmarks for each anchor standard represent a progression of learning that spans several grades. The K -12 strands, substrands and anchor standards are listed on pages 10- 16. Page 8 of 151 May 6, 2013 How to Read the Standards The standards (i.e., \"anchor standards\") are broad statements of skills and understandings that are anchored in college- and career -readiness. The benchmarks are written as learning outcomes \u2014the specific knowledge or skill that students must master to complete part of an academic standard by the end of the grade level or grade band . Each standard should be prefaced with the statement, \"The student will understand that...\" Many of the benchmarks include examples that clarify the meaning of the benchmark or indicate the level of student understanding. The examples may suggest learning activities or instructional topics. In all cases, however, the examples are optional and are NOT intended to be directives for curriculum or a comprehensive fulfillment of the benchmarks. The benchmarks for each standard are designated by five- digit codes. For example, in the code 5.3.4.10.1 \u2014 The 5 refers to grade 5; The 3 refers to the third strand, Geography ; The 4 refers to the fourth geography substrand, Human Environment Interaction; The 10 refers to the tenth geography standard, the meaning, use, distribution and importance of resources changes over time.

For example: Geographic factors \u2014 climate, landforms, availability of natural resources. Codes that begin with \"0\" indicate benchmarks that are to be mastered in kindergarten, while those that begin with \"9\" indicate benchmarks that are to be mastered in grades 9- 12. Page 9 of 151 May 6, 2013 Social Studies Substrands and Standards Citizenship and Government Substrands and Standards Substrand 1 Civic Skills Standard 1 Democratic government depends on informed and engaged citizens who exhibit civic skills and values, practice civic discourse, vote and participate in elections, apply inquiry and analysis skills, and take action to solve problems and shape public policy. Substrand 2 Civic Values and Princi ples of Democracy Standard 2 The civic identity of the United States is shaped by historical figures, places and events, and by key foundational documents and other symbolically important artifacts. Standard 3 The United States is based on democratic values and principles that include liberty, individual rights, justice, equality , the rule of law, limited government, common good, popular sovereignty, majority rule and minority rights. Substrand 3 Rights and Responsibilities Standard 4 Individuals in a republic have rights, duties and responsibilities. Standard 5 Citizenship and its rights and duties are established by law. Substrand 4 Governmental Institutions and Political Processes Standard 6 The United States government has specific functions that are determined by the way that power is delegated and controlled among various bodies: the three levels (federal, state, local) and the three branches (legislative, executive, judicial) of government. Standard 7 The primary purposes of rules and laws within the United States constitutional government are to protect individual rights, promote the gene ral welfare and provide order. Standard 8 Public policy is shaped by governmental and non -governmental institu tions and political processes. Page 10 of 151 May 6, 2013 Standard 9 Free and fair elections are key elements of the United States political system. Substrand 5 Relationships of the Unite d States to Other Nations and Organizations Standard 10 The United States establishes and maintains relationships and interacts with indigenous nations and other sovereign nations, and play s a key role in world affairs. Standard 11 International political and economic institutions influence world affairs and United States foreign policy. Standard 12 Governments are based on different political philosophies and purposes; governments establish and maintain relationships with varied types of other governments. Page 11 of 151 May 6, 2013 Economics Substrands and Standards Substrand 1: Economic Reasoning Skills Standard 1 People make informed economic choices by identifying their goals, interpreting and applying data, considering the short - and long- run costs and benefits of alternative choices, and revising their goals based on their analysis. Substrand 2: Personal Finance Standard 2 Personal and financial goals can be achieved by applying economic concepts and principles to personal financial planning, budgeting, spending, saving, investing, borrowing and insuring deci sions. Substrand 3: Fundamental Concepts Standard 3 Because of scarcity, individuals, organizations and governments must evaluate trade- offs, m ake choices and incur costs. Standard 4 Economic systems differ in the ways that they address the three basic economic issues of allocation, production and distribution to meet society's broad economic goals. Substrand 4: Microeconomic Concepts Standard 5 Individuals, businesses and governments interact and exchange goods, services and resources in different ways and for different reasons; interactions between buyers and sellers in a market determine the price and quantity exchanged of a good, service or resource. Standard 6 Profit provides an incentive for individuals and businesses; different business organizations and market structures have an effect on the profit, price and production of goods and services. Standard 7 Resource markets and financial markets determine wages, interest rates and commodity prices. Standard 8 Market failures occur when markets fail to allocate resources efficiently or meet other goals and this often leads to government attempts to correct the problem. Substrand 5: Macroeconomic Concepts Standard 9 Economic performance (the performance of an economy toward meeting its goals) can be measured, and is affected by, various long -term factors. Page 12 of 151 May 6, 2013 Standard 10 The overall levels of output, employment and prices in an economy fluctuate in the short run as a result of the spending and production decisions of households, businesses, governments and others. Standard 11 The overall performance of an economy can be influenced by the fiscal policies of governments and the monetary poli cies of central banks. Standard 12 International trade, exchange rates, and international institutions affect individuals, organizations and governments throughout the world. Page 13 of 151 May 6, 2013 Geography Substrands and Standards Substrand 1: Geospatial Skills Standard 1 People use geographic representations and geospatial technologies to acquire, process and report information within a spatial context. Standard 2 Geographic i nquiry is a process in which people ask geographic questions and gather, organize and analyze information to solve problems and pl an for the future. Substrand 2: Places and Regions Standard 3 Places have physical characteristics (such as climate, topography and vegetation) and human characteristics (such as culture, population, political and economic systems ). Standard 4 People construct regions to identify, organi ze and interpret areas of the earth's surface, which simplifies the earth's complexity. Substrand 3: Human Systems Standard 5 The characteristics, distribution and migration of human populations on the earth's surface influence human systems (cultural, economic and political syste ms). Standard 6 Geographic factors influence the distribution, functions, growth and patterns o f cities and human settlements. Standard 7 The characteristics, distr ibution, and complexity of the earth's cultures influence human systems (social, economic and political systems) . Standard 8 Processes of cooperation and conflict among people influence the division and control of the e arth's surface. Substrand 4: Human Environment Interaction Standard 9 The environment influences human actions; and humans both adapt to , and change, the environment. Standard 10 The meaning, use, distribution and importance of resources changes over time. Page 14 of 151 May 6, 2013 History Substrands and Standards Substrand 1: Historical Thinking Skills Standard 1 Historians generally construct chronological narratives to characterize eras and explain past events and change over time. Standard 2 Historical inquiry is a process in which multiple sources and different kinds of historical evidence are analyzed to draw conclusions about how and why things happened in the past. Substrand 2: Peoples, Cultures and Change Over Time Standard 3 Historical events have multiple caus es and can lead to varied and unintended outcomes. Standard 4 The differences and similarities of cultures around the world are attributable to their diverse origins and histories, and interactions with other cultures throughout time. Standard 5 History is made by individuals acting alone and collectively to address problems in their communities, state, nation and world. Substrand 3: World History Standard 6 Environmental changes and human adaptation enabled human migration from Africa to other regions of the world. (The Beginnings of Human History: 2 00,000 \u20148000 BCE) Standard 7 The emergence of domestication and agriculture facilitated the development of complex societies and caused far -reaching social and cultural effects. (Early Civilizations and the E mergence of P astoral Peoples: 8000 BCE \u20142000 BCE) Standard 8 The development of interregional systems of communication and trade facilitated new forms of social organi zation and new belief systems. (Classical Traditions, Belief Systems and Giant Empires: 2000 BCE \u2014 600 CE) Standard 9 Hemispheric networks intensified as a result of innovations in agriculture, trade across longer distances, the consolidation of belief systems, and the development of new multi -ethnic empires while diseases and climate change caused sharp, periodic fluctuations in g lobal population. (Post- Classical and Medieval Civilizations and E xpanding Zones of E xchange: 600- 1450) Page 15 of 151 May 6, 2013 Standard 10 New connections between the hemispheres resulted in the \"Columbian Exchange,\" new sources and forms of knowledge, development of the first truly global economy, intensification of coerced labor, increasingly complex societies, and shifts in the i nternational balance of power. (Emergence of the First Global Age: 1450\u20141750) Standard 11 Industrialization ushered in wide- spread population growth and migration, new colonial empires, and revolutionary ideas about government and political power. (The Age of Revolutions: 1750\u20141922) Standard 12 A rapidly evolving world dominated by industrialized powers, scientific and technological progress, profound political, economic, and cultural change, world wars, and widespread violence and unrest produced a half century of crisis and achievement. (A Half Century of Crisis and Achievement: 1900 \u20141950) Standard 13 Post-World War II geopolitical reorganization produced the Cold War balance of power and new alliances that were based on competing economic and political doctrines. (The World After World War II: 1950\u2014 1989) Standard 14 Globalization, the spread of capitalism, and the end of the Cold War have shaped a contemporary world still characterized by rapid technological change, dramatic increases in global population and economic growth coupled with persistent economic and social disparities and cultural conflict. (The New Global Era: 1950\u2014Present) Substrand 4: United States History Standard 15 North America was populated by indigenous nations that had developed a wide range of social structures, political systems, and economic activities, and whose expansive trade networks extended across the continent. (Before European Contact) Standard 16 Rivalries among European nations and their search for new opportunities fueled expanding global trade networks and, in North America, colonization and settlement and the exploitation of indigenous peoples and lands, C olonial development evoked varied responses by indigenous nations, and produced regional societies and economies that included imported slave labor and distinct forms of local government. (Colonization and Settlement : 1585 \u20141763) Standard 17 The divergence of colonial interests from those of England led to an independence movement that resulted in the American Revolution and the foundation of a new nation based on the ideals of self-government and liberty. (Revolution and a New Nation: 1754 \u20141800) Standard 18 Economic expansion and the conquest of indigenous and Mexican territory spurred the agricultural and industrial growth of the United States ; led to increasing regional, economic and ethnic divisions; and inspired multiple reform movements. (Expansion and Reform : 1792\u2014 1861) Standard 19 Regional tensions around economic development, slavery, territorial expansion, and governance resulted in a civil war and a period of Reconst ruction that led to the abolition of slavery, a more powerful federal government, a renewed push into indigenous nations' territory and Page 16 of 151 May 6, 2013 continuing conflict over racial relations. (Civil War and Reconstruction: 1850\u20141877) Standard 20 As the United States shifted from its agrarian roots into an industrial and global power, the rise of big business, urbanization and immigration led to institutionalized racism, ethnic and class confli ct, and new efforts at reform. (Development of an industrial United States : 1870 \u20141920) Standard 21 The economic growth, cultural innovation, and political apathy of the 1920s ended in the Great Depression which spurred new forms of government intervention and renewed labor activism, followed by World War II and an economic resurgence. (Great Depression and World War II : 1920\u20141945) Standard 22 Post-World War II United States was shaped by an economic boom, Cold War military engagements, politics and protests, and rights movements to improve the status of racial minorities, women and America's indigenous peoples. (Post -World War II United States : 1945 \u20141989) Standard 23 The end of the Cold War, shifting geopolitical dynamics, the intensification of the global economy, and rapidly changing technologies have given renewed urgency to debates about the United States' identity, values and role in the world. (The United States in a New Global Age: 1980 \u2014 present) Page 17 of 151 May 6, 2013 Kindergarten: Foundations of Social Studies In kindergarten, students are introduced to the four social studies disciplines of citizenship and government, econom ics, geography and history. They learn the importance of rules and demonstrate basic skills that reflect civic values. Students begin to identify things that define America's civic identity, while also learning how cultures differ from one another. They us e simple geographical tools and historical stories to explore various places and times. Students also develop an understanding of basic economic concepts of needs and wants as well as good and services . Grade Strand Substrand Standard Understand that... Code Benchmark K 1.

They expand their understanding of America's civic identity, determine characteristics of effective rules , and demonstrate ways for citizens to participate in civic life. Their exploration of the federal government begins with the elected office of president. Fundamental geography skills ar e introduced including making sketch maps of places and comparing their physical and human characteristics, and identifying locations. Students practice basic historical inquiry skills by asking questions, constructing a timeline, and examining simple records and artifacts. They build their knowledge of the past by comparing family life, buildings and other technologies from earlier times to today . Students acquire a basic understanding of the economic concepts of scarcity and trade, and weigh the costs and benefits of simple alternative choices.

Page 30 of 151 May 6, 2013 Grade 3: Foundations of Social Studies In grade three, students expand and deepen their knowledge in the four social studies disciplines of citizenship and government, economics, geography and history. By applying basic concepts in each discipline to complex communities and environments near and far, students begin to understand the social, economic, geographic and political aspects of life in the world beyond our state and nation. They further explore the civic relationship between an individual and the community in the United States in which he or she lives, the three branches of gov ernment, and the functions and funding of government. They create and interpret simple maps, using them to understand the physical and human characteristics of places around the world, from one's neighborhood to vast regions of the earth. As students examine the world of long ago through historical records, maps and artifacts, they discover how geographic factors, technology, and individual and group actions have shaped history.

Students explore the history of North America in the period before 1800. They learn about complex societies that existed on the continent before 1 500, and subsequent interactions between Indigenous peoples, Europeans and Africans during the period of colonization and settlement. They examine regional geographic factors and learn that profit motivates entrepreneurs (such as early American fur traders). They trace the development of self - governance in the British coloni es and identify major conflicts that led to the American Revolution. They analyze the debates that swirled around the creation of a new government and learn the basic principles of democracy that were set forth in the Declaration of Independence, the Const itution and the Bill of Rights. Students become immersed in historical inquiry, learning to \"think like a historian.\" They weigh the costs and benefits of decisions (such as the decision of some colonists to sever ties with the British) and analyze the con tributions of historically significant people to the development of American political culture.

Content drawn from citizenship and government, and economics, enriches the study of world regional geography, and further develops the interdisc iplinary \"studies\" approach. Students in grade 8 explore the regions of the world using geographic information from print and electronic sources. They analyze important trends in the modern world such as demographic change, shifting trade patterns, and intensified cultural interactions due to globalization. Students participate in civic discussion on contemporary issues, conduct historical inquiry , and study events over the last half century that have shaped the contemporary world. They analyze connections between revolutions, independence movements and social transformations, and understand reasons for the creation of modern nation states. They learn that governments are based on different political phi losophies and serve various purposes. By learning economic principles of trade and the factors that af fect economic growth, students understand why there are different standards of living in countries around the world.
