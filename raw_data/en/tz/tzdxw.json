On the other, medicine is full of avarice, full of greed, and full of waste, much of it by the very same folks who bring us all that medicine has to offer: the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). The ACGME is an incredibly rich and powerful organization in medicine. It is [comprised](https://www.acgme.org/What-We-Do/Overview/Member-Organizations)of the American Medical Association, (AMA), the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) and its 24 member boards (including my \"favorite\", the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM)), the American Hospital Association (AHA), the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the Council of Medical Specialty Societies (CMSS), the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), and the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM). Collectively, member organizations of the ACGME represent an annual burn rate of almost $1 billion dollars for medicine (Latest annual income figures from Guidestar.org: AMA ($261,328,052), AHA ($126,339,392), ABMS and its 24 member \"imagine a world\" where residents and fellows are \"prepared to become Virtuous Physicians who will place the needs and well-being of patients first.\" This is where the ACGME's \"vision\" clashes with reality. Right now, the average \"Virtuous Physician\" has a [median debt load of $180,000](https://members.aamc.org/eweb/upload/2014%20DFC_%20vertical.pdf)before they graduate from medical school and patients are experiencing bankruptcies from health care as our Medical Education Establishment dines at the Four Seasons and takes a few more reps in the gym. The ACGME and their kin are still living in the world where first class air travel, memberships at health clubs, and [$2.3 million condominiums](http://drwes.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-abim-foundation-choosing-wisely-and.html)with chauffeur-driven Mercedes S-class town cars are the norm. The ACGME seems blind to the irony of serving Virtuous Physicians while having one of its [core values](https://www.acgme.org/About-Us/Overview/Mission-Vision-and-Values)the \"Engagement of Stakeholders\" like their \"friends in accreditation\" at the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medicine Education, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospital Organizations, the National Board of Medical Examiners, and the Federation of State Medical Boards, who foist educational programs like their unproven and wasteful Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program to fund their largess. So it should come as no surprise that even our most \"prestigious\" academic journals like the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) are joining in on the fun. This week they permitted a promotional \"perspective\" piece entitled \" [What Do I Need to Learn Today - the Evolution of CME](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1515202)\" to be published by the head of the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), Graham T. McMahon, MD. Like other accreditation organizations within the ACGME, Dr. McMahon enjoys [paid first class airfare and health club membership](http://www.medtees.com/blog/ACCME2014FirstClass.png)while promoting the legitimacy and expense of the costly and unproven ABMS MOC program that finds itself in a [whirl of ethical controversy](http://drwes.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-maintenance-of-certification.html)already. Meanwhile, the NEJM is selling its expanded and remarkably expensive [\"Knowledge +\" MOC educational product](http://knowledgeplus.nejm.org/)without ever acknowledging this conflict to its readers in this week's issue. Our tired and inefficient \"non-profit\" bureaucratic medical education system better wake up soon to the new reality in medicine: practicing physicians and their patients are feeling the adverse effects of all those health clubs and first-class airfares. In this time of serious cuts to patient care budgets in medicine, it's time our Medical Education and Publishing Establishment starts \"learning what it needs to do today\" besides stumping for wasteful \"CME\" programs and harvesting its budget from those who are finding it harder and harder to believe that our expensive medical education bureaucracy has their best interests in "}
