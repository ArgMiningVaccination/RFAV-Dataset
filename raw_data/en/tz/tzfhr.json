Of course, surrounding yourself with things that remind you to tap into your power is magic in itself. Here are some of the essentials that TikTok's witchiest creators count on to build the right energy at home. 1. Start with an altar\u2014even if it's just a shelf. An altar isn't anything more complicated than a space you set aside to aid your spiritual journey, whether that's a whole room, a bookshelf, or just a corner of your coffee table. You can start by carving out a place to craft and practice\u2014also known as a working altar, says Honey Rose, a practitioner and tarot reader known as [@thathoneywitch](https://www.tiktok.com/@thathoneywitch?lang=en) on TikTok. \"Most people start doing spells before they work with spirits,\" they say, \"and the first thing people do is usually find a spot; find a spot in your room that works for you and feels right.\" Your home might evolve to include many altars dedicated to whatever you wish to visualize, honor, or remember\u2014whether that's your ancestors, an element of nature, a personal goal, or a specific trait you'd like to develop and nurture. \"If it's a money altar, then it's like: What is your relationship with money? And put that on an altar,\" Lammar says. \"You can have a relationship altar, for love: What do you want your relationship to look like? What do you want it to feel like? And you put all that into the altar. It doesn't have to be hard.\" It's about visualizing what you already know to be true, or what you know you're capable of achieving. \"We are altars ourselves,\" Lammar says. \"We don't need physical representations. But we're human, and we get distracted ... Coming home is a place of remembrance.\" 2. Incorporate vessels like bowls and plates As for what should fill your altar, there's no single object that's critical to developing your spiritual practice, but the WitchTok creators all conjured images of the bowls and plates that support their rituals. [Yadira Roman](https://www.tiktok.com/@yadiralacurandera), the co-creator of [Big Breath Wellness](https://www.bigbreath-wellness.com/), maintains bowls of water around her home to help balance the elemental energy of certain rooms as part of her curanderismo practice (a traditional Latin American healing system that holistically treats disorders through religious, spiritual, and health-related means). \"With certain rooms, they may feel heavier on your shoulders, or like you just don't like to be in there for too long, because you don't feel comfortable\u2014usually that room definitely needs some water in it,\" she says. Bowls can be symbolic but also practical. Lammar keeps a bowl of salt in her entryway in which she places her house keys both to organize and cleanse them. \"Salt is a very protective and cleansing material, and so that's why I put the salt in the bowl and put my keys in there, then shake them out before I go,\" she says. \"Or you can put your wallet in a money altar or money bowl. You can put it there so that you're constantly manifesting abundance.\" Lammar's money bowl is full of rice she's dyed green, coins, and four cinnamon sticks\u2014the cinnamon represents success, and the number four helps represent stability, like the four walls of a home. Similarly, Lammar keeps a small plate with a candle, an essential oil blend, and some written affirmations as a simple altar dedicated to focus next to her computer. \"That's only a three-item thing, and that's an altar,\" Lammar says. \"It's just a place where you can put you on a plate. What do you need? Who are you?\" 3. Find your practice, and start small What you need at your working altar will depend on what sort of witchcraft or spiritual practice you want to get into, whether that's container spells, candle burning, herbal apothecary, crystal healing, or anything else. Choosing that practice is deeply personal, and requires experimentation and being open to the journey of discovery. \"My spiritual awakening came from working in my garden, but I don't think there's one right way to be a witch or a starter kit of objects you need,\" says Dea B., who is renovating her dream witch home as [@wildtangledgreen](https://www.tiktok.com/@wildtangledgreen) on TikTok. You can begin by simply using what you have. \"Start small,\" says Honey, \"and whenever [something] piques your interest, go in that direction, and see what you feel like you need next.\" Honey makes [stone cauldrons](https://cna.st/affiliate-link/ms25gbZTibghGc9c97PoJDJ8k9vaLyUBHsBRAvTkNEpB1Zs5barurRMpq8RpDHAWYBj98U5XZDhwZ6NKiSYeRGBeJEHk9GRy1c?cid=620d0c8e9f3070a4c7c499b1) for folks who practice with flameware, but they say that you can just as easily begin burning in a ceramic bowl from your kitchen. \"And always have a fire extinguisher around!\" Each step of your journey is an important one. \"I tell people who are starting out in metaphysics and all that: Don't try to go overboard,\" Lammar says. \"If you're on level one, enjoy level one!\" Trust that the right tools will find you, in time. As Honey explains, \"My ancestors are very important to me. I had been learning about the importance of railroad spikes [to my ancestors] and I'm like, 'Where am I gonna find a railroad spike?'\" Then one day while browsing Etsy, they spotted a knife\u2014another common altar tool\u2014that was crafted from a railroad spike. \"I felt this draw towards railroad spikes, and it just filled this need,\" Honey adds. \"Just wait for a spark.\" Focus on things you can use and interact with, more than what looks the part. \"Put things in your home that make you want to grab [them] and use [them],\" says Honey. \"Everyone likes to have a decorative piece. But when it comes to your practice, it's a practice. You're supposed to use things. You don't want things collecting dust.\" 4. Choose objects with their own spirit Anytime you're adding to your home\u2014whether it's supplies for a spell or just a new shower curtain\u2014you can select materials, [colors](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/fall-color-trend-predictions), and scents that help elevate your spiritual relationship. \"Even in my bathroom, I have certain colors that keep me grounded,\" says Lammar. \"I wanted to make sure I got red [bath] mats, so that whenever I'm coming out into the world, the first thing that my cleansed and cleaned body hits is the power color.\" Being in tune with nature is another important touchstone of many spiritualists' practice. \"To make my home feel more magical, I try to bring the outside in,\" says Dea. \"I also gravitate towards art pieces with natural motifs\u2014I have a lot of botanical art and I also collect insect artwork and sculptures.\" Avoid artificial and mass-produced objects as much as possible, in favor of anything organic, natural, and original, Yadira says. And, if you can, shop local. \"Going local is always great,\" she adds. \"It keeps the energy of the home really happy.\" \"It's obviously not always possible to find original artwork for financial reasons, but if you can, it's definitely energetically better,\" she says. \"But also, paint your own artwork! If you really want a beautiful piece of artwork, and you can't afford it, just paint something dedicated to your home. It doesn't have to be a masterpiece, because you are the masterpiece, you know?\" 5. Let your home's spirit guide you If you've lived in enough places, Yadira says, you begin to understand that a home has a spirit and personality of its own. And you can tap into its energy to help guide your decorating decisions about what to bring home and where to put it. \"I think a lot of people unfortunately interpret the experience of their psychic abilities as something very complex,\" she says, \"and it could be as simple as feeling warmth in a certain area of your body if you ask your home a question.\" If you're not sure where your own spirit ends and your home's begins, ask the spirit of your home to step outside of your body. \"No matter how you use the term, whether it's your orbit, your aura, ask [the spirits] to take a step back,\" Yadira says, \"they respect boundaries way more than humans do, ironically.\" Take a beat to experience your spirit on its own, Yadira says, \"and then at that moment, you can ask the spirit of the house to step back in, and you'll feel the difference, and you'll understand the energy of the house a bit more. From there, you can communicate with your home's spirit to design itself. \"If you want to know if your home would benefit from some sort of decor or design, you can have visuals of that, of different options, and just ask the spirit of the house to move your hand or even a pendulum towards what aligns with it most,\" Yadira says. 6. Dedicate your home to the journey. The objects you add to your home aren't as important as the intention and meaning you put behind them. And all of the TikTok creators we spoke to, underlined the need to be graceful and flexible with your budget, your home, and yourself. Whatever journey you choose, Lammar notes that you might run into strict rules and restrictions that dictate how you practice: \"There are different spiritual paths that will say, you must have your altar in the east, west, left, right... you have to have the candle over here or over there... as somebody who has ADHD, that does not always work for me.\" \"It's not about taking other people's practices,\" Lammar continues. \"It's about making your own, based on universal truths.\" Ultimately, you should put your altar, bowls, candles, and crystals wherever it makes sense to you, and especially in places where you'll feel inspired to interact, practice, communicate, and make your manifestations happen. \"For me, having ADHD, my home has to be my path,\" says Lammar. \"It can't just be four walls. It literally has to be what motivates me to continue down a spiritual path. Because if it's out of sight, it's out of mind. So we always have to have visual cues to remind us that we're even spiritualists.\" Lammar takes that dedication a step further, by attaching a guiding intention to each place where she's lived. \"Me and my husband, we've moved from home to home, and we have named them for specific spiritual levels,\" she says. \"The Hustle Home\" is where they learned discipline and committed to success. Then came \"The Ashram\" to learn about ego and become one with the universe. Now they live in \"The Implementation Home\", where they'll focus on settling down and enjoying the life they've manifested for themselves. Naming an intention for your home\u2014even writing it down on a plaque or sign\u2014can influence every aspect of your life inside of it. \"I told my husband, 'Listen, we're in the Hustle House. I need permission to not put you in first priority. It's not the relationship house,'\" adds Lammar. \"And he said to me, 'Honey, do your thing, I will be here on the other side.' That was all I needed and boom! My business started to bump. Everything began to change and shift. We began to be more successful than we ever have in our entire marriage and that was because we decided that this home was going to be for "}
