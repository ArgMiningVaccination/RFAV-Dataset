Aroma oils are a type of therapeutic oil used in aromatherapy, the science of healing through natural plant-based aroma. Natural aroma oils are simply a blend of essential oils with other natural ingredients such as carrier oil. YUNI's formulas combine 100% natural essential oils with a mix of sweet almond, jojoba seed, and organic kukui seed oils. This signature blend in our aroma beauty products allows for easy application and quick drying. Aroma oils can be used in a variety of ways, from diffusing them into the air to applying them to the skin. Many people use aroma oils to relax and unwind after a hard day at work or simply enjoy feelings of peace and calm. Aroma oils have been demonstrated to provide a variety of health benefits, including stress relief, depression, [anxiety, and insomnia relief](https://www.yunibeauty.com/sleep-stress/). Essential oils are extracts from plants. They are created by steaming or pressing various parts of a plant (flowers, bark, leaves, or fruit) to extract the compounds that provide scent. A single bottle of essential oil can require many pounds of plant material. Essential oils, while they can be used for aromatherapy purposes, also have therapeutic properties. Aroma oils are gentler and can be applied more liberally than essential oils. They are also known as fragrance oils or perfume oils. Aroma oils come in a combination of many different scents. They can be used for several purposes, such as in aromatherapy, aroma-infused beauty products, adding a pleasant smell to furniture or clothing, and candle making. Aroma oils last for a few hours, depending on the type of oil and how it is applied. Oils applied directly onto the skin will typically last longer than those mixed with water or other liquids. On the other hand, essential oils are highly concentrated plant extracts. Each oil capture's the plant's scent and flavor, or \"essence.\" Essential oils can be inhaled, diffused, or combined with a carrier oil, but because of their potency, applying them directly to the skin can cause skin irritation.
