You need to balance effectiveness with side effects and costs. This article was originally published just before the pandemic began in earnest in the United States. It makes some salient points about balancing vaccine efficacy against side effects \u2014 a risk-benefit analysis, which is an important issue to many today as they contemplate the coronavirus vaccines. The shingles vaccine had substantial side effects for my wife and me but even if we suffered the same with the coronavirus vaccine, we would definitely opt for vaccination. Covid-19 is a potentially lethal infection for older individuals like us. The risk-benefit is clear. We got the vaccine. Our side effects are noted at the end of this article.

And prevention means a vaccine. It's not like influenza or Covid-19; it is already in your body and has been for decades. Nearly one in three people in the U.S. will develop shingles (Herpes Zoster) according to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/index.html)). For those over the age of 60, your chances of contracting shingles increases to 50 percent during your lifetime, even if you're overall healthy and active. The disease is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox (the varicella-zoster virus); it finds its way into nerve cells in the body where it can lie low and be reactivated years later. An extremely unpleasant disease, shingles follows the nerve and nerve root along its course on one side of the body, often on the face or upper chest. The virus causes nerve pain ranging from mild to intense and can make it difficult to sleep, work, or perform normal daily tasks. Within 3-4 days, the burning sensation turns into a red rash, which is followed by blisters that break open and crust in 7-10 days.
