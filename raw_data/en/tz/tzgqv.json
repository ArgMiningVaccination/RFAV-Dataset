These symptoms could be signs of [Meniere's disease](https://www.healthyhearing.com/help/tinnitus/menieres-disease), a condition of the inner ear that causes [ringing in the ears](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/) or buzzing sounds, sudden hearing loss, and vertigo-that spinning sensation sometimes accompanied by nausea. Acupuncture is an effective vertigo treatment and can help resolve the [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and hearing problems associated with [Meniere's](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/menieres-disease). A lot of people may not realize that they have Meniere's disease, because the most [common symptoms](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menieres-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20374910) can also be indicators of many other health issues. For example, sudden attacks of vertigo can be caused by a condition called [benign paroxysmal postural vertigo, or BPPV](https://vestibular.org/article/diagnosis-treatment/types-of-vestibular-disorders/benign-paroxysmal-positional-vertigo-bppv/). BPPV is another kind of inner ear problem, caused by the movement of small crystals of calcium carbonate into a part of the ear canal where they do not belong. [Vestibular migraine](https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/vestibular-migraine/) and other types of migraine headaches can cause feelings of vertigo and ringing in the ears. Ringing in the ears, also known as [tinnitus](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/tinnitus#2), can also be a symptom of a sinus or ear infection, thyroid problems, cardiovascular problems, or caused by repeated exposure to excessive noise levels. Meniere's disease is a chronic condition that can begin at any time during life, but it is most commonly diagnosed when a person is in their 40s or 50s. Most of the time, Meniere's symptoms only affect one ear. A [\"Meniere's attack\"](https://www.american-hearing.org/disease/menieres-disease/) can come on in a way that is similar to a migraine. First there may be subtle signs that it is starting, like changes in hearing, or a feeling of fullness or congestion in one ear. Then, a sudden and strong attack of vertigo can make you feel so dizzy, light-headed, and off balance that you have to lie down. You may even feel nauseated to the point of vomiting. These episodes of intense dizziness can last anywhere from several minutes to several hours, or even a whole day. Afterwards, you may feel exhausted and need to rest. Never knowing when you might have one of these attacks of severe vertigo can be very disruptive and unsettling, really having a negative impact on your life. Each person's experience of Meniere's disease is different, and there is no clear cause for the disorder. Over time, some people may have fewer and fewer symptomatic episodes, while other people may have them more frequently and may begin to develop more serious hearing problems. Hearing loss associated with Meniere's disease may seem to come and go at first, but it can progress to the point of permanent hearing loss, or deafness. [What causes Meniere's disease?](https://www.enthealth.org/conditions/menieres-disease/) Medical science is unclear as to why some people develop this inner ear problem, but it is generally believed to be related to excess fluid in the ear. Meniere's symptoms might develop after some type of head injury or ear infection, respiratory infection, or viral infection. Meniere's may be related in some cases to [migraine headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), or to immune system dysfunction. Some women experience Meniere's symptoms during their [premenstrual syndrome (PMS)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) week. As with many other illnesses, Meniere's can be triggered by [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) or [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). Currently, Meniere's treatment typically involves medications that offer some symptomatic relief, like anti-nausea medications. Acupuncture and other TCM treatments for Meniere's disease offer a holistic way to address the varying symptoms of dizziness, vertigo, nausea, tinnitus, and hearing loss. While there is no cure for Meniere's, it is possible to reduce the symptoms so that they are not so bothersome anymore and even to help prevent further hear loss. Top 5 Symptoms of Meniere's Disease Meniere's symptoms can be subtle at first, and a person may only have a few episodes of ringing in ear or vertigo once in a while. The common signs of Meniere's include: - Dizziness, vertigo, spinning sensation, light-headed - Hearing loss, hearing problems, sudden drop in hearing, sounds are muffled - Tinnitus, ringing in the ears, buzzing sound, roaring in ear - Sensation of fullness in the ear, ear feels plugged up or congested - Nausea, feeling like you're going to be sick or vomit In some cases, people with Meniere's can have sudden falls, sometimes called \"drop attacks,\" or [Tumarkin's otolithic crisis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16425641/). You may feel like you're falling, or the room is tilting around you, and the next thing you know, you're on the floor. These falls are unpredictable and can cause injuries. Medical Treatment for Meniere's Disease One of the common [treatments for Meniere's](https://www.cochrane.org/CD003599/ENT_diuretics-for-the-treatment-of-menieres-disease-or-syndrome) vertigo, ringing in the ears, or a sensation of fullness in the ears is the use of [ diuretics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21864986/) like Lasix, Diamox, or Dyazide, following the logic that they will help reduce the amount of fluid in the inner ear. However, there is not much scientific evidence showing that this method works for everyone, and diuretics may have other negative consequences, such as lowering blood pressure. Anti-nausea medications, known as antiemetics, may offer some relief from nausea during bouts of vertigo. Histamines and their receptors are understood to be involved with signalling in the brain that may impact balance, so [antihistamines](https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bcp.14046), such as Dramamine and Benadryl, are often offered as a [ way to reduce dizziness.](https://stanfordhealthcare.org/medical-conditions/ear-nose-and-throat/menieres-disease/treatments.html) Again, there is not much evidence of the efficacy of antihistamines for vertigo. Drowsiness is a common side effect of taking antihistamines. Antidepressants are also sometimes prescribed to help with vertigo. In rare instances, doctors may perform surgery to physically alter the inner ear; this is called labyrinthectomy. This may help reduce debilitating vertigo for some patients or help to prevent drop attacks, but for some people, it can cause even more damage to their hearing capabilities, and can even cause deafness. All of these medical treatments only try to reduce symptoms, they don't help to prevent hearing loss due to Meniere's disease. Can Acupuncture Help Meniere's Disease? According to [TCM theory](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Acupuncture+Treats+Vertigo+and+Meniere%27s+Disease), the sensation that the ear is clogged is related to a buildup of Phlegm, causing both physical obstruction and blocking the flow of Qi (energy). Dampness and Wind are other pathogenic factors that can contribute to Meniere's symptoms of dizziness, vertigo, and the ringing or whooshing sounds in the ear. Weak Kidney energy, combined with Wind rising from the Liver, can cause dizziness, tinnitus, and headaches. An acupuncturist will listen carefully to find out which symptoms are arising, and when, and will choose [acupuncture points on the head](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) to directly address the obstruction in the ear, as well as other points on the body to address issues with Kidney Qi. It may be helpful to make certain dietary changes to help address the excess fluid involved in Meniere's disease, including reducing salt and sodium, and limiting caffeine and alcohol. Your acupuncture provider will discuss nutritional choices that will help to relieve Meniere's symptoms. One [study](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0192415X83000173) of Meniere's patients treated with acupuncture showed not only that their vertigo had subsided after a few treatments, but that their hearing levels were maintained rather than worsening as treatment went on. Another [study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1917-acupuncture-meniere-s-disease-recovery) compared patients with Meniere's who were treated with antihistamines to a group of patients who received acupuncture treatment for 12 weeks in addition to the antihistamine medication. The patients who received acupuncture reported significantly less vertigo and dizziness, less tinnitus, and actual improvements in their hearing over the patients who received medicine only. A [review](https://juniperpublishers.com/jcmah/pdf/JCMAH.MS.ID.555715.pdf) of studies using TCM methods, including acupuncture treatment, moxibustion, cupping, and herbal supplementation, to treat Meniere's disease found that symptoms of vertigo and dizziness were, by and large, greatly reduced, to the point of patients reporting their vertigo as being fully resolved. A [study](https://www.nccaom.org/wp-content/uploads/pdf/Acupuncture%20and%20Herbs%20Eliminate%20Meniere's%20Disease.pdf) in which patients were given acupuncture and herbs for 10 days resulted in a 95% effective rate, with the majority of people treated reporting no symptoms at all after the treatment, even after a two-year follow-up. Acupuncture Near Me for Meniere's Disease in West Los Angeles Vertigo is a deeply unpleasant sensation, and never knowing when an attack of dizziness and nausea may strike can really disrupt your daily life. TCM has a proven track record of effectively helping people get over symptoms like dizzy spells and ringing in the ears, and may even help to prevent further hearing loss. If you know you have Meniere's disease, or if you have some combination of these symptoms but aren't sure what's going on, it may be a good time to visit a qualified acupuncturist to see if acupuncture can help relieve dizziness due to Meniere's, migraines, or BPPV. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

Traditional Chinese Medicine is based on Qi, which is an invisible force that usually cannot be observed by modern science.

[ How to Treat PTSD With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Ph.D. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder [(PTSD)](https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Posttraumatic-Stress-Disorder) is a type of mental illness that develops after a person has gone through a traumatic life event. PTSD flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, nightmares, and sleep disorders are a few of the most common signs of PTSD. Acupuncture and TCM are widely accepted as a highly effective way to treat complex PTSD and other [stress disorders](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/stress/), attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [insomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/). [PTSD](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand_tx/tx_basics.asp) is mostly commonly associated with veterans of the military, as many soldiers who have served in combat experience trauma related to war violence. A significant amount of scientific research and psychiatric study has been devoted to finding out about PTSD and what treatments for PTSD are effective. Relative to other conditions, there have been quite a few studies showing that acupuncture can be helpful for PTSD. The U.S. Navy has even started an acupuncture training program in San Diego, after a Pentagon study showed that [TCM is beneficial for veterans](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2015/01/08/acupuncture-for-ptsd). PTSD is not only a problem for military veterans, though. PTSD can result from all kinds of traumatic life events, including things like: accidents, natural disasters, surgeries, assaults, attacks, abandonment, or the death of a loved one. [More than 8 million](https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/treatment-facts) Americans are currently living with post traumatic stress. People of all ages can experience PTSD. PTSD can result from experiencing something traumatic directly, or being a witness to such an event. People whose jobs involve exposure to violence or disturbing situations, such as first responders, social workers, or police officers, can also have PTSD because of things they have seen. A person can be deeply traumatised by something they didn't see happen firsthand, but that they heard happened to someone close to them. The body's [response to extreme stress](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response) is one of its ways of protecting us. Stressful situations cause the \"fight-or-flight\" response and chemicals like adrenaline to be released. When this happens repeatedly, or to an extreme degree, because a person is literally in fear for their life, there can be long-lasting physical and emotional effects. Normal, everyday stress we hope to release from the body through exercise, meditation, laughter, and other stress-reducing activities. But when a person has endured abuse or life-threatening danger, they may not be able to [release the stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) from their bodies so easily. [TCM theory offers a way to help](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3870484/) people deal with mental health issues like PTSD because it creates a context in which emotional and mental symptoms interact with physical symptoms. TCM addresses the way that trauma and negative emotions are stored in the body, sometimes causing overwhelming emotional and physical symptoms. [Acupuncture and herbs](https://www.tcm.ac/2018/12/26/management-of-ptsd-with-chinese-medicine/?v=88588bacf0da) are holistic treatments for PTSD that can be used as an adjunct to therapy and medications to help relieve stress, sleep problems, mood disorders, negative emotions, and problems with cognitive function. Top 10 Signs of PTSD Many people don't realize that they are experiencing post traumatic stress. PTSD can overlap with several other types of mental health problems, and the symptoms of PTSD can often seem similar to those of other anxiety disorders or symptoms of depression. What PTSD feels like can be highly individual to each person and what caused their initial trauma. The most commonly recognized symptoms of PTSD include: - Flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, reliving traumatic events, can't stop thinking about what happened - Nightmares, recurrent, vivid, disturbing dreams - Avoidance of triggering places, activities, or people [Memory loss, amnesia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), unable to remember periods of time related to the traumatic event - Negative perception of self, negative perception of the world, blaming self or others - Isolation, unable to connect with other people, relationship problems - Feelings of anger, irritability - Hypervigilance, always aware of perceived threat, can't relax, exaggerated startle response, always on guard, panic attacks [Difficulty concentrating, inability to focus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)on the present - Insomnia, can't sleep PTSD often coexists with other mental health issues like [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/anxiety/), panic attacks, and depression. [Chronic fatigue syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) (also knowns as [ME/CFS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/))has been associated with PTSD. [Fibromyalgia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-musculoskeletal-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), a syndrome that can cause generalized muscle pain, sleep problems, fatigue, and other problems can be related to PTSD. Sometimes fibro manifests after a traumatic event. Types of PTSD The term \"stress disorder\" refers to a combination of physical and emotional symptoms that are the body's and mind's stress responses to some type of trauma. Different types of stress disorders include: - Normal stress response - even common everyday work stress and relationship stress can cause widespread health problems. Serious issues like a relationship breakup, or job loss can lead to negative emotions and physical problems due to stress. People of all ages can experience debilitating symptoms of stress like: stomachaches, headaches, trouble concentrating, [rapid heartbeat](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)or trouble sleeping. If stress is allowed to build up over time, it can seriously damage health. Past illnesses or viral infections, like [Epstein Barr and mononucleosis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-mononucleosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)can also be a factor. - Acute stress disorders - acute post traumatic stress is the immediate aftereffect of some sort of traumatic event or life-or-death situation. If the short-term (30 days or less) acute signs of trauma are left unaddressed, they can turn into PTSD. - Uncomplicated PTSD - this refers to PTSD symptoms related to a specific traumatic event, such as a car accident, being the victim of a crime or assault, or surviving a natural disaster and its aftermath. This type of PTSD causes symptoms like: flashbacks, nightmares, avoiding a particular area, thing, or person, and strong feelings of anger, blame, and fear that impact your relationships and sleep patterns. - Complex PTSD - [complex trauma](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/compassion-matters/201207/recognizing-complex-trauma)is the result of multiple, repeated traumatic episodes, like suffering abuse as a child, being in an abusive relationship, domestic violence, or repeated sexual abuse. [Complex PTSD](https://psychcentral.com/ptsd/complex-posttraumatic-stress-disorder-symptoms#common-triggers)could also happen to people living in wartime conditions or who are part of a targeted community under brutal conditions. PTSD attacks can be brought on by complex PTSD triggers that remind you of the traumatic events, such as: a particular place or smell, a time of year or date, a physical pain or sensation in a particular part of the body, or reading a story or seeing a movie or TV show that brings up the memory. - Comorbid PTSD - this refers to PTSD that coexists with other serious issues such as substance abuse, addiction, and/or depression. Comorbid PTSD is very common, because many people suffer from more than one of these mental health conditions at the same time. In general, complex PTSD and comorbid PTSD are considered more difficult to treat and more likely to affect people throughout their lives than uncomplicated PTSD. PTSD Treatment [Treatment for PTSD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355973) typically involves a combination of psychotherapy/cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychiatric medications for PTSD such antidepressants (SSRIs or Klonopin). Long-term use of anti-anxiety medications is generally not recommended, as patients can become dependent on them, leading to [abuse of the drugs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-addiction-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). SSRIs can be helpful for symptoms of depression, but they can also have negative side effects, like [sexual dysfunction (ED),](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ed-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) weight gain, nausea, [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and making sleep problems worse. Exposure therapy is a specific type of therapy that helps people learn coping skills by working with the distressing memories or exploring possibly frightening situations in a safe environment with a therapist. Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing [(EMDR)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3951033/) helps patients learn to adapt to the stress tied to the past trauma by thinking about it while looking at a movement pattern or listening to a repetitive sound. This treatment has been shown to help PTSD patients heal emotional trauma more quickly than talk therapy or CBT alone. The conventional [treatments for PTSD](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments) can help some patients, to different degrees, but many people with complex trauma do not want to go through this type of treatment. Talk therapy, trauma-based CBT, and exposure therapy may be terribly intimidating to people who are suffering with PTSD, and patients may be more afraid of entering into these kinds of therapy than continuing on with their current symptoms. The TCM modality of acupuncture can have a positive effect on neurotransmitters, the brain chemicals that influence cognitive thought patterns and moods, without the potential negative side effects or dependency that can result from medications. [Acupuncture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3580897/) can be a helpful alternative or complementary treatment to other types of therapy for PTSD. Can Acupuncture Help PTSD? In historical records of TCM, we do not see a word or description of a condition that is directly synonymous with PTSD. However, in TCM, we view emotional states as being related to the function, or dysfunction, of specific organ systems. The symptoms of PTSD can correlate with these relationships between the organs, the mental state, and physical manifestation of symptoms: - Lung - Grief - Wheezing, trouble breathing, sweating, fatigue - Spleen - Worry - Nausea, gastric problems, loss of appetite - Liver - Anger - Headaches, muscle pain, [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Heart - Anxiety - Palpitations, insomnia - Kidney - Fear - [Urinary frequency](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bph-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), night sweats, memory problems A TCM provider will look carefully at how each individual describes their physical symptoms and emotional state, and will choose [acupuncture points for PTSD](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1410-acupuncture-for-combat-ptsd-found-effective) and herbs to help strengthen the organ systems that need nourishment. In regards specifically to military veterans with PTSD, many survivors are wary of seeking medical or psychological treatment for complex trauma. The majority of soldiers who have served in the Middle East in recent years have been diagnosed with PTSD, but less than half of those veterans are receiving medical treatment for PTSD. Many people, in general, are reluctant to seek care, either because they don't trust that it will work, or their complicated feelings of shame, guilt, grief, and anger are too overwhelming to share with others. Acupuncture can be particularly helpful for some people suffering from PTSD because it does not necessarily have to involve talking about the original trauma or abuse. Some patients may avoid psychotherapy for this very reason, as they are not ready, and may never be ready, to go over these details with another person. An acupuncturist can help relieve symptoms of anxiety and depression by focusing on the person's emotional and physical needs and tailoring the treatment to fit their symptoms and lifestyles. A [clinical study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02869646) done by the Long Beach V.A. randomly divided patients into \"real acupuncture\" and \"sham acupuncture\" groups, and the patients received treatments twice per week over the course of 12 weeks. The veterans who received real acupuncture showed significant physiological improvement, with less startle reactions, as measured by skin sensors, than the sham group. A [Rand review](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1433/RAND_RR1433.pdf) found that acupuncture helped improve symptoms of depression, anxiety, and sleep problems in PTSD patients. Acupuncture Near Me for PTSD in Los Angeles It can be a long and challenging process to overcome complex PTSD, but with the right combination of PTSD treatment, it is possible to reduce or even eliminate symptoms. With a TCM approach and acupuncture treatment, we can help reduce anxiety and depression, address feelings of anger and grief in a clinically meaningful way, and help to [promote better sleep](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). If you or a loved one is dealing with unresolved trauma and needs help, you may find that acupuncture is a low-risk and supportive way to treat PTSD. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Seizures With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-seizures-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac., Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. Sudden loss of consciousness, convulsions or jerking body parts, staring, feelings of fear, anxiety, deja vu? These are all possible [signs of seizure](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093). Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that causes different types of seizures. Research has shown that acupuncture and TCM treatment for epileptic seizures can be an effective adjunct to conventional treatment. Epilepsy is a common disease of the central nervous system that can happen to people of all ages. Epilepsy is a term that can refer to a variety of different types of seizures; it defines a condition in which a person has recurrent seizures. Over 3 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with epilepsy; it is one of the [most common](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/epilepsy) neurological disorders worldwide. What is the cause of seizures? Unusual electrical activity in brain cells [can cause various types of seizures](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/about-epilepsy-basics/what-causes-epilepsy-and-seizures), depending on what area of the brain is affected. In some cases, people begin to have seizures due to a head injury, or a brain infection, such as [meningitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-meningitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Some people seem to be born with an unusual brain structure that affects the area of the brain that causes seizures. In older people, symptoms of epilepsy may coexist with those of other neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, or seizures may start occurring as an effect of having suffered a [stroke](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-stroke-recovery-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or [heart attack](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Seizures can be caused by an allergic reaction to some food, as when a person with [Celiac disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-celiac-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) is exposed to gluten. Medical science has not yet discovered the exact meaning of seizures that occur in other cases, but it is thought to be due to genetics. People with epilepsy need treatment to try to prevent or reduce seizures. While some seizures are mild, others can be severe, and even life-threatening. TCM has been using acupuncture treatment and herbs to help seizures for many, many years, and recent research is beginning to [demonstrate how TCM](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292226/) as integrative care for epilepsy can be beneficial. What Happens During a Seizure? The signs of seizure [can vary widely](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/about-epilepsy-basics/facts-about-seizures-and-epilepsy) from person to person, but an individual's specific pattern of what seizures look like will usually remain consistent. Symptoms of seizure include: - A range of changes in awareness: from staring and being unresponsive, up to totally losing consciousness - Stiffening of the limbs, limbs twitching, or part of the [body shaking](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-essential-tremor-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Changes in vision: double vision, seeing flashes of light, staring, or blinking repeatedly [Dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), sudden [headache](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Sweating, nausea - Having trouble breathing, or stop breathing - Falling down for no apparent reason, sudden collapse, head nodding, muscles go limp, sometimes called \" [drop attacks\"](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Loss of bladder or bowel control - Feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [panic attack](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), fear - Sense of having an \"out of body\" experience - Strange taste in mouth or smelling strange smells - Feelings of confusion - Drooling or frothing at the mouth, biting tongue or inside of cheeks - After the seizure, a person may feel exhausted, or have [amnesia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-amnesia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), trouble remembering what happened. Historically, there have been many misconceptions about people who suffer from seizures, or \"fits disease.\" When a person is not having a seizure, they are usually otherwise healthy and capable. People with epilepsy are not necessarily limited in what they can do physically or mentally-except when they are having a seizure-,unless they have other chronic health problems in addition to epilepsy. If you see someone having a seizure, DO stay near them and make sure they are safe. If they fall or seem to be unconscious, turn them onto their side and make sure they are breathing. DO NOT try to physically restrain a person who is having a seizure or attempt to put anything in their mouth. The idea that a person might swallow their tongue while having a seizure is a myth. Top 10 Types of Seizures There are many types of seizures. Sometimes a person has one one seizure caused by medication, drug withdrawal, illness, or some sort of trauma to the brain. A person may have a seizure due to an [allergic reaction](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-allergy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) to some kind of medication or food. Experiencing one seizure does not mean a person is epileptic. Epilepsy is only diagnosed if a person has multiple seizures over time. Seizures are divided into two main categories: focal onset or generalized onset. \"Focal\" refers to a seizure that originates from a localized part of one of the hemispheres of the brain. \"Generalized\" means that there is seizure-causing activity happening all over, or on both sides of the brain. Specific types of seizure include: - Focal Seizure with Retained Awareness - Or, \"focal onset aware seizure.\" Used to be known as a \"simple partial seizure\" or \"partial seizures.\" These are usually short in duration (less than 2 minutes) and a person remains conscious and aware while it is happening, although they may not be able to respond to people around them, or they seem \"frozen.\" The specific feelings vary widely: a sense of deja vu, sense of pressure or anxiety, a strange, overpowering smell, etc. - Focal Onset Impaired Awareness seizure - also used to be called \"complex partial seizures,\" \"temporal lobe seizures,\" or \"psychomotor seizures.\" In this type of seizure, the person loses awareness of their surroundings. They may seem to be staring, zoning out, picking at their clothing, wandering aimlessly, smacking their lips, or making grunting sounds. These, too, are short in duration, and afterwards, the person may feel confused and very sleepy. - Febrile seizures - these are seizures that are caused by having a fever over 100 degrees, usually as a result of having some type of infection, like a flu. [Febrile seizure](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/febrile-seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20372522)happens in young children; they may have shaking all over or jerking limbs, convulsions, or lose consciousness. Occasionally children may have febrile seizures in response to having a fever after receiving a vaccination. Febrile seizures do not cause brain damage or indicate a neurological disorder; they do not mean a person has epilepsy. - Absence Seizure - used to be called \"petit mal seizure.\" This is a type of generalized onset seizure in which a person briefly loses awareness, or \"blanks out\" for just a matter of seconds. They are caused by abnormal brain activity, possibly related to hyperventilation. [Absence seizures](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/epilepsy/absence-seizures)are more common in children, who may outgrow this disorder. - Myoclonic Seizure - this is a very short kind of seizure that causes muscles to jerk or twitch for just a few seconds. \"Myo\" means muscle, and \"clonus\" means contraction and relaxation. These can happen to people with epilepsy, but [myoclonic seizures](https://www.epilepsy.com/learn/types-seizures/myoclonic-seizures)can also happen to anyone. That feeling of being jerked awake and having a spasm in your legs when you are falling asleep is a kind of myoclonus. - Tonic Clonic Seizure - this used to be known as \"grand mal seizure.\" This is the type of seizure that causes convulsions, stiff arms and legs, shaking all over, and other symptoms such as losing bladder control, crying out or making strange sounds, losing consciousness, and falling to the ground. A person who has experienced [tonic clonic seizures](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/epilepsy/tonic-clonic-grand-mal-seizures)before may notice an \"aura\" before the more severe symptoms of seizure begin; this might include a sense of vertigo, dizziness, nausea, feelings of anxiety, or strange smells or a weird taste in the mouth. Tonic clonic seizures may last a few minutes, and the person may be exhausted and emotional afterwards. - Refractory Seizures or Uncontrolled Seizures - also called \"drug-resistant\" or \"intractable\" seizures, this is when a person has frequent and/or severe seizures that do not respond to medical therapy such as anti-epileptic medications. - Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) - LGS is a rare form of epilepsy that shows up very early in life, usually when a child is still in infancy. [Lennox Gastaut](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/lennox-gastaut-syndrome/)causes various kinds of seizures, both tonic (muscle spasms) and atonic (staring, still), or absence seizures. Children with LGS may experience multiple seizures per day, and have [learning delays](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)due to cognitive dysfunction.The cause of LGS is sometimes unknown, but it can be due to abnormal brain development, or a baby having some type of infection or loss of oxygen in utero, before they're born. - West Syndrome - also called \"infantile spasms,\" this is a type of epilepsy in young children that causes spasms and unusual movements for a baby, like throwing out of the arms, straightening the arms out to the sides, knees pulled up to the chest, the upper body bending forward, or head thrown back. [West syndrome](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/w/west-syndrome.html)seizures only last a few seconds, and they usually go away by the time a child is past toddler years. - Status epilepticus - This is a neurological emergency condition in which abnormal brain activity causes a prolonged seizure that lasts longer than five minutes, or multiple seizures that occur back-to-back without recovery in between. This can happen to a person who has epilepsy, or it can happen due to trauma, such as a head injury, or a hypertensive ( [high blood pressure)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/)situation, or a severe reaction to drug toxicity, or an autoimmune disease response. There could be motor symptoms of shaking and collapsing, or the person could just be staring and unresponsive, depending on where the disordered activity is happening in the brain. Status epilepticus is a true medical emergency, and a person needs immediate attention to prevent brain damage. Medical Treatment for Epileptic Seizures Conventional treatment for seizures usually involves medications known as anticonvulsants (anticonvulsive), or anti-seizure [medications](https://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/medications-treat-seizures). First, it is necessary for doctors to accurately diagnose the problem: what type of seizures is a person having, and what is causing them? Some drugs help to stop seizures from happening in the short term. Tranquilizers like Valium (Diazepam), Ativan (Lorazepam), and Klonopin may help to stop a seizure while it is happening, but people build up a tolerance quickly to these medications and then have to take higher doses to get the same effect. Other medications, like Aptiom, are taken daily to prevent seizures. There are many other medications used to treat different types of epilepsy, but these medications only work to control seizures in some cases. Other people may struggle to find a medication they can tolerate. Anticonvulsants and other anti-epileptic drugs can cause side effects like weakness, dizziness, headaches, nausea or vomiting, and skin rash. People who experience seizures do need treatment to control epileptic symptoms, but it can be challenging to find the right combination of therapies. Acupuncture and [TCM treatment offer an alternative](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2014/12/25/tcm-for-epilepsy-and-seizure-disorders) treatment that may help to control seizures without negative side effects. Can Acupuncture Help Epilepsy Symptoms? TCM has a long history-over 2000 years-of helping people who have epileptic seizures. The first documentation of acupuncture treatment for seizures by TCM practitioners was written at least 200 years B.C.. Specific Chinese herbs to treat epilepsy have been used for many centuries, and are now being studied through scientific research to prove their efficacy. Several [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769134/) have shown that various herbal formulations help to reduce the frequency of seizures. [Data also show](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-10857-0_12) that acupuncture treatment can help alleviate symptoms of epilepsy, reducing the occurrence of seizures through its positive effect on neurotransmitters in the brain. According to TCM theory, epilepsy usually arises due to problems with the Liver system. Too much Wind affecting the Liver can cause spasms or convulsions. Liver Yang Rising can lead to muscle twitching and/or dizziness. An acupuncturist will use a combination of modalities such as acupuncture treatment, electro-acupuncture, Chinese herbs, and therapeutic massage to help seizures. As with so many health conditions, inflammation plays a role in epileptic seizures. Auricular acupuncture [(ear acupuncture](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/615476/)) and [electro-acupuncture](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00601-1) (electro-stim) may have an anti-inflammatory effect on the brain that helps to reduce the frequency of seizures. TCM theory posits that stimulation of specific acupressure points (such as [\"Shenmen\" points on head](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) or ear) for epilepsy can help to calm the mind and produce a [positive effect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3292226/) on the parasympathetic nervous system. A [recent study](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1306-acupuncture-synergizes-epilepsy-relief-new-finding) compared patients who received the standard medication therapy for epilepsy with those who had acupuncture treatments for 12 weeks in addition to drug therapy. At a one year follow up, the patients who had received acupuncture for seizures had a statistically significant improvement of their epilepsy symptoms compared with patients who had received only the conventional medical treatment. Acupuncture Near Me for Epileptic Seizures Los Angeles Area It is challenging to manage seizures, but it is possible for people with epilepsy to live a long and healthy life with minimal disruptions. Living with a chronic and unpredictable health condition like epileptic seizures can cause emotional suffering in addition to physical symptoms. The holistic approach provided by TCM and acupuncture treatment can be considered as a safe form of complementary alternative medicine for epilepsy. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat HIV/AIDS With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hiv-aids-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Tan, L.Ac.,Ph.D. & Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., Ph.D. What does it mean to be HIV positive? HIV is a viral infection that harms the immune system over time and, if untreated, can eventually lead to AIDS, a syndrome that causes people to become weaker and get serious infections easily. There is no cure for [HIV/AIDS](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/what-are-hiv-and-aids), but there are various therapies that can slow the progression of HIV. Acupuncture and TCM herbs can help to improve immune function and relieve symptoms related to the side effects of other HIV/AIDS drug therapies. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that affects the immune system by destroying the white blood cells (CD4 and T-cells) that are such an important part of the body's immune response, causing people with HIV to be [ much more prone](https://www.avert.org/living-with-hiv/health-wellbeing/health-conditions) to all kinds of infections. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the late stage of HIV, in which the CD4 cells have reached a critical low point and other infections are taking hold in the body. [Over a million](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/data-and-trends/statistics) people in the U.S. are currently living with HIV. Many more people may have HIV and not know it. People can have HIV for several years without feeling any symptoms, while the illness is in its early stages. HIV is a progressive illness, which affects the functioning of the immune system over a long period of time. 4 Stages of HIV Infection: - Infection - when a person contracts the HIV virus, it spreads quickly in the body, often causing flu-like symptoms: fever, headache, rash, [sore throat](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-sore-throat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). If you have these types of symptoms, and you think you may have had contact with an infected person or a needle recently, it is very important to go get tested for HIV. Early testing allows people to get treatment as soon as possible, and to know if they are contagious and can spread the virus to others. - Asymptomatic - the HIV virus remains in the body, causing damage to cells and weakening the immune system, while the person may have no symptoms of HIV/AIDS. This latent stage of HIV can last for quite a long time, averaging 8-10 years. This is why many people do not realize they have HIV until they are tested. - Symptomatic - Eventually, a person with HIV will begin to feel the effects: fatigue, mouth sores from oral candidiasis, diarrhea, and weight loss. Other infectious diseases can easily get into the body because of the weakened immune system; these are called opportunistic infections. Common co-infections associated with include: tuberculosis (TB), [cryptococcal meningitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-meningitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), toxoplasmosis, [hepatitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hepatitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and [pneumonia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pneumonia-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - HIV progression to AIDS - In some cases, people with HIV who receive treatment to help boost their immunity are able to stave off progression into the AIDS stage of illness. However, if the CD4 cell count drops and other infections take hold, a person is considered to have progressed into the AIDS stage. Being diagnosed with HIV can be emotionally devastating. Knowing you have a serious illness with no cure is naturally going to cause a lot of [ stress,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) feelings of [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), and even [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). With good health care, it is possible these days to live a long life with HIV. Putting together a team of caring health care professionals who can provide integrative care for HIV/AIDS will help you maintain the best physical and mental health possible. TCM provides [holistic care for patients living with HIV](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4690280/) or AIDS that works on all levels: keeping your mental outlook positive, helping you sleep better, boosting immune function, and relieving symptoms that are due to side effects of medical treatment, or caused by concurrent infections. How Do You Get HIV/AIDS? The [HIV virus is carried](https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/about-hiv-and-aids/how-is-hiv-transmitted) through certain bodily fluids: blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breastmilk. In order for HIV to be transmitted from one person to another, one of these types of body fluids must have the infection present in it, and must get into the other person's bloodstream through broken skin or mucous membrane. HIV is not transmitted through saliva, sweat, urine, or feces, and is not carried in the air in droplets. You cannot get HIV through water or air, or by touching surfaces. The way that HIV is most often passed from person to person is through sexual contact. Other ways you can get HIV are by sharing needles while using drugs, getting a tattoo with a needle that wasn't properly sanitized, or a blood transfusion. (As a reminder: we only use single-use, disposable, sterile needles for acupuncture treatment.) A woman could also pass HIV to her baby when breastfeeding. Using condoms during sex and only using sterilized needles are the primary ways to prevent HIV infection. Top 10 Symptoms of HIV Most people with HIV will go through a long phase of having no noticeable symptoms. Eventually, after the virus has spread slowly, people with HIV will begin to show symptoms such as: [Fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), feeling tired all the time - Fever, or feeling hot even if you don't show a fever [Diarrhea](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diarrhea-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - I [nsomnia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/insomnia/), night sweats - Weakness, [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Weight loss, wasting, loss of appetite - Nausea - Skin rash, or purple spots on skin, bruise easily - Shortness of breath - Swollen lymph glands [Oral candidiasis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK367577/), also known as thrush or oral [candida](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-candida-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), is also common among people living with HIV because the suppressed immune system makes it easier for the fungal infection to take hold. Burning sensation or pain in the mouth cavity and redness with white patches are the signs of oral candidiasis. Long-term use of antifungal medication (Fluconazole) to control thrush can cause side effects and eventually cease to be effective as the body develops a resistance to it. HIV can also lead to neurological problems, like peripheral [neuropathy](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), in which the signals between the brain and the rest of the body are compromised, causing symptoms like: muscle twitching, loss of balance and coordination, tingling or burning sensations, or numbness. Medical Treatment for HIV and AIDS Advances have been made in medical treatment for HIV/AIDS. Different combinations of medications that block the replication of the virus can help to slow the progression of HIV in the body. This type of drug therapy for HIV used to be called HAART, short for \"highly active antiretroviral therapy.\" Now, it is usually referred to as ART or cART, which stands for \"combination antiretroviral therapy.\" This form of treatment for HIV can increase chances of survival and quality of life, but is not well-tolerated by all patients. Lifelong use of the medication is required, which, for some, makes HIV a manageable chronic illness. For other patients, the side effects of cART may not be tolerable. Side effects of HIV medications can involve [gastric problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy. Medications can cause liver dysfunction, damage to the liver, and bone marrow suppression, meaning fewer blood cells are being made by the bone marrow. While a person is still in the asymptomatic phase of HIV, doctors may not begin using [antiretroviral therapy](https://www.verywellhealth.com/cart-hiv-combination-antiretroviral-therapy-48921) because of concerns related to side effects and resistance. However, taking some steps to optimize immune function can potentially help stave off progression into symptomatic and AIDS stages. TCM herbs and acupuncture can be helpful during this phase to help strengthen the immune system and hopefully slow down the progression of disease. Acupuncture and herbal treatment with TCM may also be used as an adjunct therapy during later phases in order to help people tolerate cART better by reducing nausea and other gastrointestinal effects of the medication and helping to improve appetite. For patients with HIV, TCM treatment is designed to help strengthen the body's immune defenses in the hopes of preventing advancement to the AIDS stage of disease. For patients in the AIDS stage, TCM treatment focuses on helping to alleviate symptoms of opportunistic infections and to mitigate the side effects of other medications. TCM for HIV/AIDS What is HIV from the TCM perspective? TCM puts a lot of emphasis on the prevention of disease by maintaining a balance of yin and yang energies in order to protect the body's Vital Qi. It is Vital Qi that keeps invasive illnesses like viruses from getting into the body and taking hold there. There are no TCM historical records that point specifically to AIDS, but we do have centuries of practice treating various kinds of invasive viral infections. Modern TCM practitioners apply this knowledge when treating patients with HIV/AIDS. [Syndrome factors](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21906520/) of HIV according to TCM: - Qi deficiency - Blood deficiency - Yin deficiency - Yang deficiency - Phlegm - Dampness - Qi stagnation - Essence deficiency An invasion of heat causes the early symptoms of HIV infection: fever, itching (pruritis), and fatigue. Then, later on, as the virus moves deeper into the body, toxic heat causes problems with the organ systems of the stomach, spleen, kidneys, and liver that lead to the weight loss and poor appetite indicative of later stages of HIV and AIDS. Herbal formulations can help relieve the diarrhea that is often reported by patients with AIDS/HIV. [Herbs](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Acupuncture+and+HIV+Living+Well+with+HIV) that work to help strengthen the spleen can improve fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, diarrhea, and skin rash. Strengthening deficient Qi is central to [ TCM treatment for HIV](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00974454) and can help to improve immune responses in the body. Chinese herbal formulations can aid in reducing the spread of the infection with results similar to those of cART medicines, while simultaneously having a positive effect on the immune system overall. Herbs do not come with the negative side effects associated with drug therapy for HIV/AIDS. In addition to the other immune-related problems, people living with HIV/AIDS are also likely to have systemic [inflammation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012895/). HIV can cause damage and inflammation in the gut, and cause blood clotting, making people more susceptible to cardiovascular problems and heart disease. Acupuncture [has been shown](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398958/) to help reduce systemic inflammation in HIV patients. [Some studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21695615/) have suggested that herbs may help AIDS patients to live longer, and improve chances of long-term survival. Treatment of HIV with acupuncture and herbs can help to relieve symptoms and reduce the side effects of other treatments. Acupuncture Near Me for HIV/AIDS in the Los Angeles Area If you or someone you love is living with HIV, getting the best care possible as soon as possible is vital for improving the long-term outcome. Putting together a program of complementary health care for HIV/AIDS can help offer the best chances for survival, quality of life, and peace of mind. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat PMS With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Xiaomei Cai, L.Ac., swings, [bloated stomach](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and weight gain. Why is PMS so bad? [Premenstrual syndrome (PMS)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20376780) is a set of symptoms that occur in the days before a woman gets her period. PMS symptoms affect every woman differently, and can be serious enough to disrupt your life every month. TCM is an effective way to deal with PMS, because [acupuncture treatment can help](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005290.pub2/full) relieve both physical and emotional symptoms of PMS and severe PMS, also known as [PMDD](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd) (premenstrual dysphoric disorder). To say that PMS is common among women is an understatement. The vast majority of women experience some changes in both their mental health and their bodies the week before their period starts. Whether or not a woman feels that it has a negative impact on her daily life may change over time. For some women, PMS isn't a big deal; for others, it's a major problem that can affect their relationships, impact their work, and make life hell every month. Most women find their own particular pattern of PMS is somewhat predictable-until it isn't. One of the most frustrating aspects of menstrual problems is the sense that things change without warning, and symptoms can come on suddenly with ferocious intensity. It can be difficult to describe how you feel before your period, because the symptoms seem to come and go. Some women find that their PMS symptoms are different from month to month. In some cases, they might find that every other month is bad, while the alternating months aren't so bad. Why is PMS worse some months? Other than the basic understanding that PMS is caused by fluctuations in hormones and brain chemistry, conventional medical science does not offer much in the way of clear answers about what causes PMS. TCM provides a different framework for looking at menstrual problems and has been used to treat women's health issues of all kinds for many centuries. [TCM treatments](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6513602/) including acupuncture, acupressure, moxibustion, and Chinese herbs can not only help relieve PMS symptoms, they can also be beneficial for other menstrual problems like [irregular periods, PCOS](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-polycystic-ovarian-syndrome-pcos-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [painful periods, endometriosis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-painful-periods-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [heavy periods, fibroids](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and symptoms of [perimenopause](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menopause-symptoms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Top 10 Symptoms of PMS As a syndrome, [PMS](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/premenstrual-syndrome) is considered a collection of symptoms that often appear together, in various combinations in different individuals. In the case of PMS, a woman may feel that her own symptoms change as often as every month, or gradually over the course of years. Girls in their teenage years may experience PMS in one way. Then, a woman in her early adult years may develop a different set of symptoms. After having a baby, a woman may find that her PMS symptoms have changed again. Then, many women in middle age experience changes in PMS symptoms as they go through perimenopause, approaching menopause. The most common signs of premenstrual syndrome include: - Mood swings, low mood, feelings of sadness or anger - Anxiety, feeling tense and irritable, cry easily or lose temper, want to be left alone - Trouble sleeping, insomnia, disturbed sleep - Breast tenderness, sore breasts, swollen breasts - Food cravings, changes in appetite - Weight gain, stomach bloating, water retention, pelvic pressure - Gassiness, changes in digestion and elimination [Acne](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-acne-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), skin problems - Changes in libido - Headaches, migraines, difficulty concentrating, foggy head Less obvious or well-known symptoms of PMS include: [vision problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-glaucoma-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [tingling in the arms or legs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-neuropathy-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), lack coordination (clumsiness, dropping things), bruising easily, [heart palpitations](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [dizziness](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and increased [TMJ jaw pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Other health problems can be amplified during the premenstrual [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and anxiety disorders. The physical and emotional aspects of PMS can affect each other, causing the typical mood swings. Feelings of sadness and frustration, or lack of sleep, may lead to comfort eating, but then the sight and sensation of your bloated stomach can cause you to feel depressed about your body. Minor problems with your spouse or co-workers can suddenly seem overwhelming and make you feel angry or helpless. For some women, PMS symptoms are so bad that they feel unable to function the week before their period. Severe PMS is now diagnosed as [PMDD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/expert-answers/pmdd/faq-20058315). What Is PMDD? PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) is a severe form of PMS marked by intense emotional symptoms that dramatically impact a woman's life, in addition to physical symptoms. \"Dysphoria\" is the opposite of \"euphoria;\" in other words, it is a mental state characterized by profound unhappiness and negative feelings. It is estimated that about 5% of all women experience this extreme type of PMS. Signs of PMDD include: [Severe anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), [panic attacks](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), paranoia - Severe depression, in some cases even suicidal thoughts, lack of self-worth - Anger and irritability that provokes rage and causes conflicts with other people - Fatigue, low energy, [inability to concentrate](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), feelings of confusion - Intense food cravings, possibly leading to binge eating Again, there is currently no scientific answer for what causes [PMDD](https://iapmd.org/about-pmdd), although it is generally believed to be related to the way estrogen levels and progesterone levels change between ovulation and the onset of the menstrual period. Mood is considered to be related to serotonin levels in the brain, and this is why [PMDD](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/9132-premenstrual-dysphoric-disorder-pmdd) is usually treated with birth control pills, which suppress ovulation, and/or antidepressants (SSRIs), which affect serotonin uptake. Medical Treatment for PMS Naturally, when a woman asks for advice about PMS or PMDD, she is going to hear suggestions like: \"try meditating, exercise more, eat a healthy diet, and get more sleep.\" And it is true that making good lifestyle choices is an important part of helping to reduce PMS symptoms. But women who are suffering with serious PMS need solutions beyond these kinds of lifestyle guidelines. When women complain of PMS symptoms, [doctors](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premenstrual-syndrome/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20376787) will most often recommend OTC pain medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen (NSAIDs) to relieve pain. Diuretics may be used to relieve bloating or premenstrual weight gain. Of course, most commonly, women are prescribed oral birth control pills, which suppress ovulation, and therefore may reduce the severity of PMS symptoms. More and more frequently, women may be prescribed antidepressants to try to deal with emotional symptoms and mood swings, or anxiety medications to take as needed during PMS. In effect, doctors often treat PMS the same way they would depression or anxiety. Clearly, birth control pills are not helpful for women who may want to get pregnant, and some women may be concerned about how taking the pill or antidepressants may affect their fertility in the future. None of these pharmacological solutions for PMS address the root cause of the symptoms, and all of these medications carry side effects that may impact a woman's overall health. Health care for women with [TCM seeks to address](https://www.pacificcollege.edu/news/blog/2015/01/25/the-pms-relief-you've-been-looking-for-traditional-chinese-herbs-and-acupuncture) the deeper internal causes of hormonal imbalances and other problems with the organ systems that are impacting the health of the ovaries and the regularity of the menstrual cycle. Can Acupuncture Help PMS? While it is only in recent years that conventional medicine has begun to acknowledge connections between physical health and emotional health, TCM has understood for many hundreds of years that health conditions of all kinds, especially those related to the menstrual cycle, are rooted in the balance of energies. Menstruation represents an ongoing process of transformation that occurs not only within the reproductive organs, but which affects every part of a woman, and even the people around her. The concept of Yin and Yang in Chinese philosophy describes two opposing yet complementary forces that are constantly acting upon each other in order to achieve balance. The menstrual cycle is very much based on Yin and Yang energies; during the follicular phase of the cycle (before ovulation), Yin is increasing while Yang is decreasing, and in the luteal phase (after ovulation, before the period), Yang is increasing while Yin is decreasing. The system is designed, naturally, to create the right conditions for conception; this process of Yin and Yang exchange is what determines a [woman's fertility](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-infertility-in-women-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). While the health of the uterus and ovaries is definitely central to the process, within the TCM philosophy, they are not the only organs involved with menstruation. The Kidneys, Liver, and Heart all have important roles to play, as well. In TCM, we also view the elements of Fire-to provide warmth, controlled by the Heart-and Water, controlled by the Kidneys-to provide moisture, as being vital to all processes within the body, especially to menstruation. Blood is cleansed, stored, and then distributed to the other organs by the Liver. Blood being central to the process of menstruation, the Liver's role is really key in how the whole thing plays out. According to TCM theory, most PMS and PMDD symptoms are caused by problems with Liver Qi. When the Liver Qi is out of balance, it can lead to feelings of anger, frustration, depression, and irritability. The Liver system is particularly susceptible to negative [effects of stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). There are a few [different variations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5494079/) of Liver Qi imbalance and other patterns that can contribute to PMS symptoms: - Liver Qi invasion - This is a condition of excess, in which there is too much rising Liver Qi, characterized by overall negative emotions that are disruptive, including anger and anxiety, breast tenderness, headaches, dizziness, and constipation. - Liver Qi depression - In this case, there is not enough Liver Qi, causing feelings of sadness, heaviness in chest, painful swelling of breasts, sighing, bloated stomach, lack of appetite, cramping during period, scanty blood during period. - Spleen Kidney deficiency - In this case, stagnant energy in the Kidney system is preventing water from moving appropriately, causing water retention or edema. From the scientific medical standpoint, acupuncture treatment has been shown to have a positive effect on neurotransmitters like serotonin, and to impact levels of estrogen and progesterone. This happens naturally because we are using TCM methods to restore optimal function of all the organs. With Chinese herbs we are able to get specific nutrients into the body that we cannot get from the foods we normally eat. Acupuncture treatment accompanied with [specific herbs for PMS](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006414.pub2/abstract) patterns can help balance the liver Qi, and bring all of the organs into synergistic harmony. In order to make lasting change, it is best to have acupuncture treatment at least once or twice a week. We need to deal with [each phase](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6614973/) of the menstrual cycle as it occurs by tailoring the acupuncture treatment and herbs to your PMS and period symptoms. A [systematic review](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1471-0528.2011.02994.x) of ten controlled trials using acupuncture to treat PMS concluded that TCM treatment of PMS significantly improved symptoms. Top 3 Tips for PMS Relief From TCM Perspective There are still a lot of taboos surrounding women's health, and many girls and women have never learned how to take care of their reproductive health. Working with an experienced TCM doctor will enable you to get personalized care and advice about how to eat the best diet for PMS symptoms, what activities to avoid before your period, and other female hygiene tips that you may not have heard before. - Nutrition - conventional Western thinking about healthy eating currently focuses on eating fresh, whole foods, which is good, except that people tend to think this means eating a lot of foods raw or cold, as in salads and smoothies. According to the TCM philosophy of nutrition, though, eating cold foods is actually one of the worst things you can do when it comes to relieving PMS and painful periods. Putting a lot of cold food into the stomach cools down the temperature of the other internal organs, which can contribute to more cramping and worse cramps. During the week before your period, concentrate on eating plenty of nourishing, cooked foods like soups and stews, proteins and vegetables, and whole grains like brown rice and quinoa. Avoid too much dairy, sugar, caffeine, hot, spicy or fried foods (that includes chips and crackers), and definitely avoid icy cold beverages and frozen treats. - Keep track of your period - there are many apps available now to help with this, but it can also be a simple chart with room for notes about your symptoms. Keeping track of your PMS symptoms every month can help you recognize patterns in your own behaviors and experiences. A record of PMS symptoms will also help you communicate what you're feeling to your health care providers when you are seeking treatment for PMS or PMDD. - Exercise - gentle movement modalities that move Qi through the body are great to help PMS: Tai Qi, yoga, or dancing are all good. Avoid deep twists that could squeeze or put pressure on the ovaries and other organs. Again, keep track of your exercise routines and how they affect your physical and emotional wellbeing from month to month so that you can see which type of workout is best for you, or if some types of exercise make PMS worse.
