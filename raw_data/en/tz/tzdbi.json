Conceiving a child is a sacred bond and the ultimate act of commitment. While some couples find it easy to get pregnant, for others the process can be extremely disheartening and overwhelming. When you are trying to bring a child into the world, it is important to incorporate traditional medicine with spiritual techniques. Always consult with your physician to discuss the ways you can best prepare your body for pregnancy and to rule out any medical issues that may hinder your ability to get pregnant. Once you have sought the advice of your doctor, you can proceed with some spiritual methods to help enhance your probability of conceiving. Preparing a Fertility Bath One of the oldest and most powerful fertility enhancement techniques is a ritual bath. Ritual bathing involves using special herbs to impart essences that are conducive to achieving your desired goal - in this case, love and conception. Spiritual baths have the multi-faceted effects of relaxation of the body and stimulation of the inner-self. A potent herbal blend used to boost fertility is [13 Aromatic herb bath](https://www.originalbotanica.com/13-bush-herb-bath/). When performing a ritual bath, it is vital that you are able to fully relax and focus on the process. Be sure that you will have the time and frame of mind to fully commit to the ritual. To begin, anoint a [Fertility candle](https://www.originalbotanica.com/fertility-hand-carved-prepared-candle/) with [Rose Oil](https://www.originalbotanica.com/rose-essential-oil/). Light the candle and place it in a spot that you will be able to see it from the tub. Prepare the herb bath by steeping the herbs in boiling water. Once the liquid is cool, strain the mixture. Be sure that the stopper is closed in your tub so that the liquid does not go down the drain. Pour it over the body while standing in your bathtub. Recite the following: \"With a same purpose, we call you. With one heart, we long for you. Child of the Earth, air, fire and water, In our lives, we welcome you\" Fill the tub the rest of the way with water and soak for at least 15-20 minutes. Let the flame of the candle mesmerize you and send you into a state of deep relaxation. After your bath, do not dry yourself with a towel. Allow yourself to air dry. For maximum effectiveness, repeat this ritual every day for 13 days.
