They can uplift your home and bring out its true disposition. [Ayurvedic](https://www.architecturaldigest.in/content/kerala-kairali-ayurvedi-retreat-palakkad-village/) aromatherapy uses the properties of essential oils and their scents to balance the doshas (energetic dispositions according to ayurvedic principles) of your living space and infuse the area with harmony and vitality. Ayurveda divides the clock into cycles based on the type of energy that is predominant in our bodies and in nature during each four-hour window. Every day, we cycle through the three doshas\u2014Vata, Pitta, and Kapha\u2014twice a day, as per the following schedule: Kapha: 6 am to 10 am; 6 pm to 10 pm Pitta: 10 am to 2 am; 10 pm to 2 pm Vata: 2 am to 6 am; 2 pm to 6 pm Using Fragrances to Complement Doshas Each dosha corresponds to a certain type of scent. Here's how to choose the right fragrance for each part of the day. For the Kapha Time Frame Choose fragrances that are warm, slightly spicy, and stimulating such as rosemary, basil, eucalyptus, peppermint, cedar, sage, anise, and ginger. These will also energize you on cold days. For the Pitta Time Frame Use sweet aromas like jasmine, gardenia, rose, mint and chamomile, and yarrow. These essential oils will also soothe you during the extreme summer heat. For the Vata Time Frame Warm, citrusy oils like sandalwood, sweet orange, rose, lemon, jasmine vanilla, lavender, lemongrass, lemon, ginger, and ylang-ylang will work well here. They're pleasant and grounding to the senses. Essential Oils to Use as Aromatherapy in Your Home Lavender Lavender has a sweet, floral scent with a herbal undertone.
