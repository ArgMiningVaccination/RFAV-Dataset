What next? 1) By train From London Heathrow Airport take Piccadilly line from Heathrow Terminals to King's Cross Station. Then train from King's Cross to Cam bridge Station. Take a taxi/bus from Cambridge Station to College. (About 2 hours) (This is recommended for those who do not have a lot of luggage and have taken trains in UK before.) From London Gatwick Airport take train to London Victoria Station, trans fer by Underground to London King's Cross (Not recommended because King's Cross Station have lifts but Victoria Station does not! You will have to carry your luggage up the stairs!) (About 2.5 hours) From London Stansted Airport take train directly to Camb ridge Station (About 0.5 hour) (Very convenient, closest London Airport Terminal to Cambridge) (N.B. A Young Person's Card can be purchased at Station with a photo and passport or online if you are aged between 16 -25 years old. This gives you 1/3 off for t rains. 1 year (\u00a330) or 3 years (\u00a370). It can be connected with an Oyster Card to give public transportation within London. Also, if you are visiting London or areas around London, quite a few attractions provide a 2 for 1 offer if the train tickets are pr esented. https://www.daysoutguide.co.uk 2) By coach National Express Coaches take you from London Airport Terminals to Cambridge City Centre, but it usually takes longer than train. Timetables can be found on www.nationalexpress.com. It is worth to purcha se a 16 -26 Young Persons Coachcard which gives 1/3 off. 1 Year (\u00a310) or 3 Year (\u00a325). Fares are usually cheaper when booked in advance. 3) By taxi Taxi can be booked online following the links below. It is the most convenient way if you come to UK for the first time and have a lot of luggage. You may ask if anyone else is arriving at the airport on the same day so you may share a taxi. save these numbers for future use if you want to order a taxi in Cambridge. 3. Communication and wifi The UK country code is +44, you can ge t a mobile phone with from one of the following operators: Giffgaff, Lycamobile, Lebara, EE, Three, O2. Usually members of an operator can make and receive free phone calls and texts from another member of the same operator. You may select a Monthly contra ct (esp. if you would like to get a new contract phone) or a Pay As You Go account. We will give out free SIM cards in the Freshers' Squash in the International Freshers' Week as well. Many colleges provide their own landlines, and you will be informed by colleges about how to use them. However, as you may find out, WiFi coverage is reasonably good in university properties, so you can contact your family and friends with Skype and other social media. 4. Accommodation and finding your way around Cambridge All colleges in Cambridge provide accommodation to underg raduates, and will help graduates find accommodation in the city if they do not provide it. You may enquire your college about the earliest date of moving in. The International Freshers' Week assumes that most people arrive on 27th Sep (Tuesday), and for those whose colleges do not provide accommodation on the night of 27th Sep, you may book a B&B in one of the following colleges: Sidney Sussex https://www.sid.cam.ac.uk/confer/accommodation/bookingindiv St Catherine http://www.caths.cam.ac.uk/conferences/b ed-and-breakfast/make -booking Churchill https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/conferences/services/bandb/ Locations of col leges are shown in the map next page . You may see for yourself where you and your friends are. Go to http://map.cam.ac.uk for more details. For most students we recommend booking Sidney Sussex if you would like to come earlier than the college move -in date, due to its central location and proximity to one of the largest supermarkets (Sainsbury) in City Centre. An alternative would be staying with a friend from colleges such as Sidney Sussex, Churchill, Newnham, Peterhouse, Jesus, which provide accommodation at an early date. Alternatively, you may go to http://www.booking.com/ to book for a double room if your parent(s) is staying with you.

Finance If this is your first time long -term stay in UK, you might need a Bank Account. Some choices of banks include Llyods, HSBC, Barclays, NatWest , and Santander. You might want to check on their websites to see which one is better for you. Make an arrangement Online and ask the college to write you a letter of proof of address before you go to a bank. Also, a cheque book and Online Transaction Service come handy and could be required for free. Before that you could bring some cash to UK. A few hundred pounds wo uld be sufficient for the first few weeks. 6. Health and living The weather in UK is notoriously bad, so bring/buy a good umbrella and/or a waterproof coat. Although the winter is cold, the lowest temperature is only a few d egrees below 0 (nothi ng like Canada or Russia). So we would not remind you in particular to bri ng warm clothes unless you are from the equator. It is usual for people to get Fresher's Flu during their first few weeks, when they face the change of environ ment both physically and mentally. Embrace it. Don't panic. Get good rest. Your college would help with your registration with the GP (i.e. medical service in UK), which can help if you have some serious diseases. Or you can go to your college nurse. It is recommended that you make a record of your GP. There is a University NHS Dental Practice near the Engineering Department, which provides free treatments for those aged below 19. You may fill out an HC1 form (which can be collected from the Boots store on Sidney Street or Online) and post it to the NHS to apply for the NHS Low Income Scheme which covers: NHS prescription Travel to receive NHS treatment NHS wigs and fabric supports NHS wigs and fabric supports Sight te sts, glasses and contact lenses Boots is the UK's leading pharmacy -led health and beauty retailer, where you can find medicine and domestic products, and print photos. A Boots Advantage Card gives you discounts. Similarly, you may ask for a similar membership card in most supermarkets, e .g. The Co -operative Food, Sainsbury's, Tesco, etc. NUS extra from the National Union of Students gives you 10% off at The Co -operative Food, 5% off at Amazon and some restaurants and stores, and can be purchased via the link below. And I just found out t hat this year they provide a free one year International Student Identity Card (ISIC) which is good news for those who like to travel! https://cards.nusextra.co.uk/ 7.
