The remedies are versatile and can be used for many different complaints and conditions (many of which you may have never thought about). Tricks of the Trade: The Lost Art of Traditional Osteopathy In the right hands, traditional osteopathy is subtle but powerful. The human body is a complex machine designed for perfect balance. When that balance is deranged, most often by an injury, acutely, we hurt. Over time, that mechanical imbalance affects our biochemistry, how we sleep and how we function. Over time, gravity and aging starts to take a toll. Think of the body as mechanical system wrapped on the outside by biology. The secret to returning that balance and health is to disengage the muscles and tissues from the memory of that injury pattern and the body is able to return to its previous memory of the preinjured state.
