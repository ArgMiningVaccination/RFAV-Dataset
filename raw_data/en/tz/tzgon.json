Walker River (above) feeds Walker Lake (left), one of only three desert, terminal lakes - meaning no water flows out - with a freshwater fishery in the world. The environmental health of the river and the Mineral County, Nevada lake is interdependent. It is linked to the economic health of the entire Walker Basin, which depends on these waters for agriculture and recreation. But the health of the lake is fragile, as rapidly declining water levels result in increased salinity. Through the Walker Basin Project, environmental and economic researchers with the Desert Research Institute and the University of Nevada, Reno are exploring the best means to get additional water to the lake while maintaining the basin's economy and ecosystem. The comprehensive, federally funded project also involves the acquisition of water and water rights from willing sellers.The wonder of Walker Look onLine Learn more about the Walker Basin Project and the researchers and projects shown here at http://www.nevada.edu/walkerPhotos by Jean Dixon Nevadarama Non Profit Org.

Commencement is the culmination of the efforts of our students and their families, our faculty and staff: universities have many goals but the success of students is paramount. Without this sea of caps and gowns, we cannot consider ourselves an institution of higher learning. Our warmest congratulations go out to our recent graduates and their families. Many great american cities are built around colleges and universities. There is a synergy between universities and cities from which we all benefit since it increases the overall quality of life, contributes to a strong economy and builds a strong citizenry. universities contribute knowl - edge, talent and tolerance to the communities that surround them. The best universities become interwoven with their communities and the boundaries are blurred. They can be centers of artistic and intellectual activity that nurture the soul of the community. universities serve as economic anchors in communities creating an educated workforce and an environment that nurtures intel - lectual curiosity, research and discovery. i have begun to engage in one-on-one discussions with faculty, staff and students so that i can better tell the story of our institution through a series of town halls, letters to colleagues and friends and through a blog for students. i recently sat down with our new student leader, Sarah ragsdale, president of the associated Students of Nevada, and with Scott Mensing, associate professor in the department of Geography. Sarah is a health ecology major, on target to graduate in four years, who has been actively involved with student life practically from the first day she set foot on our campus. Scott is this year's recipient of the regents Teaching award, an annual award presented by the Nevada System of Higher education to the professor throughout the entire system with the most distinguished teaching record. Students like Sarah and faculty like Scott are making Nevada a better institution and a compelling destination for students and scholars. This is your university and we hope you will be part of its future. Whether you live across the street, across the state or across the globe, you always have a home here at Nevada. For myself, i am grateful for the opportunity to play a small part in serving the university, the community and the state.

Much of Nevada is considered a high fire-hazard environment, possessing all the ingredients necessary to support intense and uncontrollable wildfires. Within this high hazard environment are individual homes, subdivisions and entire communities. Unfortunately, many Nevada homeowners are not prepared to survive a wildfire. The Living With Fire program was developed to inform Nevadans how they can live safer in high fire-hazard environments. Living With Fire is not a wildfire prevention program. Despite the best efforts of firefighting agencies, much of Nevada's wildlands will continue to burn. The purpose of Living With Fire is to teach people how to safely coexist with wildfire when it does occur. The Living With Fire program began in 1997 , when Ed Smith of University of Nevada Cooperative Extension, the University's Paul Tueller and Fire Chief Loren Enstaad of the Sierra Front Wildfire Cooperators applied for and received a Nevada Agricultural Experiment Station / Nevada Cooperative Extension Joint Program grant. Together with Nevada's firefighting organizations, they developed a set of consistent wildfire threat reduction recommendations for Nevadans. These are the foundation of the Living With Fire educational materials and programs. Since then, the program has continued to grow.

First, he talked about not just winning, but winning with class \u2014 a classy team, a classy coach and classy fans who know the difference between rooting for their own team and cursing at the opposition. Get a mental picture of this \u2014 the 5-foot-and-change Dr. Glick walking across campus chatting with an unnamed Nevada player, all of whom range in height from over 6 to over 7 feet. They were talking not about basketball, but the student athlete's future plans. Class. Values. Dr. Glick noted that although winning primarily helps raise contributions to athletic scholarship funds, it also brings alumni and friends in to chat about donations to other programs. The University has only 49,000 alumni compared to 250,000 for many of its competitors. It needs new friends for financial support. He talked about recruiting nonathlete students, as well. Everyone wants to belong to a winner. Nevada needs to keep its best high school students in the state. It needs to attract a more diverse student body from out of state Winning with class helps.

TELL ME hOW NEV aDa WaS In reading your Spring 2007 issue (which is the best I have seen, congratulations), I read the article on Art Smith's torpedo practice in Pyramid Lake. Art Smith and I were both natives of Sparks and I was a few years older. A group of University of Nevada students, Tom Allard '47 (history), Bob Games, Pat Eaton and I, joined the Navy Aviation Cadet program in April 1942. Allard and I were assigned as flight instructors after receiving our commissions and Navy wings in January 1943. Art came through our flight squadron as a cadet and I was his instrument flight instructor. While Art was still a cadet at the naval air base in Corpus Christi, Texas, I invited him to join my wedding party at the Chase Field Air Base in Beeville, Texas. Tom Allard was my best man and Art was a groom in the party. We were all in Navy dress white uniform. The reception following the wedding was held in the Naval Officers Club on the base. Since he was a cadet and not allowed in the club, I dressed him in my Navy ensign uniform, since I had been promoted to first lieutenant. He had several hours of nervous celebration with us before taking off for his barracks. Pat Eaton was killed in a plane crash during the war. Both Tom Allard and Art Smith have now passed on but all three of us came home and graduated from the University of Nevada.

These wild animals are spread across 10 Western states, according to the latest figures from the U. S. Bureau of Land Man - agement's Wild Horse and Burro Program director, Sally Spencer. Of the five states that have burros, Nevada ranks third behind Arizona and California. As of Feb. 28, 2007 the horse and burro population was 28,898.Sperling's Best Places compiled Business Week.com's Top 10 list for artists in the United States1, and Carson City ranked third as an arts haven.

Researchers found a high concentration of actors, musicians, writers and other artists \u2014 the key factor in Carson City's position on the list \u2014 can stimu - late the economy by attracting res - taurants, boutiques, galleries and wealthy benefactors.

Fifteen percent of the 667 people turning in the survey lived outside Washoe County. Known as one of the most compre - hensive festivals in the country, Artown offers about 300 visual, performing and humanities events monthlong in about 50 locations citywide. The University has been instrumental in this growing interest in the arts, say two of Artown's founders, Tim Jones, associate direc - tor of the School of the Arts, and Howard Rosenberg, University art department professor and member of the Nevada Board of Regents. \"The University's im - pact on the arts in Reno is tremendous,\" Jones says. \"Those of us planning arts-based economic diversifi - cation in downtown Reno knew that if we could get people coming downtown, the overall arts industry in the area would flourish. The emphasis on arts and culture in Reno is one reason a School of the Arts was implemented in January 2004.\" The July celebration attracts more than 200,000 people annually.

Nevada Silver & Blue Summer 2007 7TONIGHT'S HOMEWORKNevadaScopeeconomic development experts recently sought the opinions of Nevadans to make citizen input part of Target20 \u00180, an economic development initiative. residents should care, says Chuck alvey, president and chief executive officer of the economic development agency of West - ern Nevada, because there's no such thing as a completely stable economy. \" if the economy isn't growing and creating opportuni - ties it's probably going the other direction. When that happens, property values drop, job op - portunities evaporate, and if Joe Citizen is older, there's no one to care for that person. That's why the average citizen needs to care if the economy is vibrant.\" So northern Nevada needs to grow its economy, but in a way that is sustainable and beneficial to the region. Whereas once indus - tries and prospective businesses were looking for sunsets, sym - phonies and school kids, today's business planners also want to know what a region can offer in terms of employees, training and research in the very industries in which they are working. attracting compa - nies that can bring high-wage, knowledge-based jobs to the region means having a workforce prepared to work with them. That's some of what eda WN took into account when it hired angelou economics to design an economic development roadmap for northern Nevada. \"Target20 \u00180 was a compre -hensive economic development planning initiative that was ultimately driven by the voice of the community,\" says Ben loftsgaarden, angeloue conomics project manager. as a result of Target20 \u00180, future economic recruitment will focus on industries that already have a foothold in Nevada and can benefit from land availability, easy distribution and academic and re - search programs at the university. \"The university is, without a doubt, one of the top assets to spur economic development in not just reno, but throughout the region,\" says loftsgaarden. \"The more closely the university is connected to the community in which it operates, and conversely, the more the community connects to and touts the university, the greater the benefit for both groups.\" Regional ambassadors . Tar- get20 \u00180 identified six industries already in Nevada that can thrive with what the region has to offer: advanced logistics, advanced manufacturing, business and financial services, clean energy, life sciences, and software and computer engineering. Then eda WN created lead gen - eration teams as a way to let those industries know northern Nevada is open for business. The six individuals heading those teams have a connection to higher educa - tion: four from the university, one from Truckee Meadows Com - munity College and one a member of the Nevada System of Higher education Board of regents. Team members are current in their fields, have access to the up-and-coming workforce and attend and present at industry conferences nationally and internationally where they meet people in those fields. \"The job of professor is dif - ferent than it used to be,\" says dale rogers, a lead generator and university Foundation Profes - sor for logistics and supply chain management. \"People think we're just sitting in our offices reading books. Typically i travel a great deal because ideas that we have are in a fair amount of demand. There's a lot of weeks i'm here to teach my classes, but there's a lot of weeks i'm not here most of the week, so being a lead generator for me is talking to people where they are, as opposed to being here and waiting for them to come to us. When Chuck [ alvey] asked me about doing this i said 'But i'm hardly ever here' and he said, 'That's exactly why we want you to do it: because you're out talking to people.'\" Targeted workforce. There's a perceived problem with Nevada's workforce, which boils down to too much of a good thing. With unemployment around 3.6 percent, businesses wanting to relocate aren't sure they will find enough employees. a long-term solution, says alvey, is to create a workforce and this is the basis for a key northern Nevada selling point: businesses can partner with the university to develop capstone courses or new programs to help build their workforce. Computer game engineering and renewable energy are two examples. in the wake of the dot-com bust and outsourcing jobs, university enrollment in computer sciences engineering dropped 50 percent since 2000. demand for employ - ees with this expertise, how - ever, keeps increasing. Software companies are attractive because they have what is called a \"small footprint:\" they don't use much water and don't pollute, and they offer knowledge-based, high-wage jobs.

A movie about women's baseball helped the former Nevada collegiate medalist and University Hall of Famer overcome the unexpected turn of events and garner a first in women's golf. it was my first time playing in the Weet - abix Women's British Open in Woburn. i had applied to get into the tournament after winning the u.S. Women's Open in July. When i applied, i was the fifth or sixth alter - nate, so i wasn't expecting to go. They called me a week before play started, when i was in Seattle, and i had my manager pack for me. i was flying over there thinking, i'm going to play a links course [the layout common to Scotland, ireland and england, characterized by open layouts and heavy rough, favoring finesse and accuracy over power]. i'll put my driver away. it was a tough week. The airline had lost my golf clubs and i had to play the practice rounds without them. i was traumatized. it's always nice to have the clubs you're going to play with. The problem was i had no idea when they were going to arrive. i practiced with gentlemen's clubs four swing weights too heavy for me. My swing weight [a standard for measuring the balance point of the club head as it swings, with d-4 being heaviest] is D-0. The lie angle for my club wasn't right. i had to buy new shoes, raingear, tees and balls. everything that had to do with golf. after a two-day delay, i got my clubs back and that was a relief. But it was all a little unsettling. The weather was difficult through the early rounds. The week after the British, we had the Solheim Cup matches coming up. i would be a player and the expectations were pretty high for me, but Nancy lopez, Beth daniel and Betsy King were there in Woburn and the media thought they'd be the ones to watch. i watched the movie A League of Their Own the night before the final round. i think that movie is what got me through that week. Those girls in women's professional baseball had to deal with a lot of adversity. if they could get through it, so could i. and if i did, i'd be the first to win the Women's British Open and the u.S. Women's Open in the same year. i can't remember if i was leading enter - ing that last day, but i was in the final group [Sheehan shot a closing 67 to break the course record at Woburn and finished \u00182 under par.] i remember the \u00186th hole, i made a 30- to 40-foot putt that put me ahead by three shots. T wo holes to play. i don't think i had a good lie on \u00187 and i hit it from the trees. But i recovered. On \u00188, the hole had a road on the left side and out of bounds on the right. it was a tight-driving hole. i had about a three-shot lead and i said to my caddy [former Nevada women's golf coach Carl laib], \" i'm going to hit a 2-iron on this par-5.\" i barely got to the fairway. as long as i hit it down the middle, that's where i wanted it. The crowd was probably thinking i was playing it safe. i had blown so many tour - naments by hitting my driver off line. as i walked down that fairway, i was crying and the emotion i felt was a lot different than any other tournament i'd ever played. i had a lot of pride that i was carrying the u.S. Open trophy with me. it was a wonderful experience. The wonderful things people said to me. you could really feel the energy. The way they speak over there. it was, \"Well done, Patty.\" i've got an irish name, so i think they liked that and they're really appreciative of good golf. i tried to stay pretty close to Carl. He had never been in that situation either. We've shared a lot together. He was starting to tear up and we were so choked up that we couldn't talk. For me, it was then a 7-iron and a 9-iron shot to the par-5. i was so emotional and trying to get a grip. i didn't want to three-putt and look silly. i was about 20 feet away from the hole. i got within a foot and a half. The second putt went in and i was so happy to be finished. The other competitors were all very gracious and complimentary. They love competition in Britain. at that time the Women's British Open wasn't an lPGa-sanctioned event [it became a major championship in 200 \u0018]. it had been really wet and rainy. We had a few delays. i guess i played steady and i was right there at the end. There were times when i didn't have my clubs that i was wishing i were at home with a fire in the fireplace. But you have to keep plugging along. i'm extremely proud to be the first female to win those tournaments in the same year. i think it's the only thing that i can say belongs to me. That's one that no one else will have.Photo Courtesy of LPGA Patty Sheehan holds the U.S. Women's Open championship trophy in 1992, just before winning the British Open.

Research clearly shows that sunlight helps our mental outlook and is good for us. However, too much exposure can lead to serious medical problems including sunburn and heat stroke. Long-term exposure increases your chance of developing skin cancer, cataracts and premature skin wrinkling or brown spots. Prolonged exposure to the sun can lead to heatstroke, a serious medical emergency that requires immediate medical attention. Heatstroke occurs when the body is unable to regulate its own temperature and the body temperature rises to dangerous levels. If you suspect someone is suffering from heatstroke move them to a cooler environment. If possible, place them in a cool bath and provide liquids.

Given the aging of our population, and unless a way is found to delay the onset of the disease, it is projected that close to 16 mil - lion people will be affected in the United States by 2050. Nevada will see a 100 percent increase in citizens with this type of dementia during the next 20 years. But what is lost in these numbers are the per - sonal tragedies: the tragedy of having one's mem - ories, accumulated over a lifetime, gradually stripped away; the tragedy of watching someone you have loved and admired slowly losing their powers of thought; the tragedy that comes with caregivers having to sacrifice to provide needed care, often at the expense of family. Dr. Charles Bernick, professor of internal medicine at the University of Nevada School of Medicine, is a national leader in the treatment and care of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Based in Las Vegas, he has studied the disease for more than two decades, going back to his days as the attend - ing neurologist at the UC-Davis Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Center. Nevada Silver & Blue' s Mark Levine sat down with Bernick to learn about the latest in Alzheimer's disease. Nevada Silver & Blue: Let's start by defining Alzheimer's. Bernick : alzheimer's is a disease strictly of the brain that causes progressive degeneration of brain cells, resulting in a steady decline in memory and other mental functions, often in conjunction with behavioral changes. NSB: What are the common symptoms associated with Alzheimer's? Bernick: although symptoms may vary from person to person, the typical initial symptom is that of impairment of short-term memory. This can be accompanied by behav - ioral symptoms such as apathy, increased ir - ritability, depression or paranoia. in addition, individuals often have trouble with \"execu - tive\" functions of decision making, planning, reasoning and judgment. NSB: Yet, this is only the beginning. Bernick: yes, as alzheimer's progresses, people lose more and more abilities that they attained through development such as lan - guage function, dressing, attention to hygiene, toileting and, at end stages, even the ability to swallow. NSB: There are a number of terms tossed around to describe memory disorders. What is the difference between dementia and mild cognitive impairment? Bernick: in the field of medicine, the term dementia is used to describe anyone who has experienced a decline in memory and other cognitive functions that interferes with their normal daily activities and social relationships. While alzheimer's disease is the most common cause, dementia can also be caused by a variety of other conditions such as depression, drugs, metabolic diseases such as hypothyroidism, head trauma, tumors and infection. Since some of these conditions are reversible, it's critical to identify the actual cause of dementia so the most appropriate treatment can be rendered. On the other hand, mild cognitive impair - ment is a borderline condition between nor - mal functioning and alzheimer's disease. NSB: How many Nevadans have Alzheimer's? Bernick: in Nevada, between 30,000 to 40,000 individuals have alzheimer's disease. NSB: With the increasing number of \"baby boomers\" approaching their 60s, at what age does the disease start to present noticeable symptoms?Research offers hope to Alzheimer's patientsKee PiNG M eMO ry alive Photo by Jean Dixon Since joining the School of Medicine in 1994, Dr. Charles Bernick has directed the creation of a statewide network of Alzheimer's disease clinics in Las Vegas, Reno and Elko.By Mark LevineNevada Silver & Blue Summer 2007 \u00182 Mark Levine is senior director of health sciences communication for the School of Medicine .InterviewBernick: The majority of people with alzheimer's begin to have symptoms after 70, although the average age at diagnosis is 80. NSB: Many people automatically equate Alzheimer's with growing old, but this is not always the case. Bernick: age is unquestionably a risk factor for alzheimer's disease but we all know indi - viduals who live into their 90s and are sharp as a tack. Conversely, alzheimer's disease can begin as young as the late 40s or early 50s, though these cases are rare. NSB: Are we any closer to fully understand - ing what causes this disease? Bernick: Our understanding of alzheimer's disease has grown by leaps and bounds over the past \u00185 years. We have characterized the abnormal proteins that are commonly thought to trigger the brain cell death seen in alzheimer's disease. We have also uncovered the genetic influences that lead to the disease, developed promising means for early detec - tion, and formulated medications that provide symptomatic benefit. NSB: How likely am I to develop Alzheimer's if it's present in a family member? Bernick: if you have a family member with alzheimer's disease you are statistically at a higher risk of developing it. We know that in approximately 5 percent of cases, there are genetic mutations that lead to the disease, usu - ally with an early age of onset.For the majority of cases, there are likely \"susceptibility\" genes that put you at higher risk to get the disease but that must interact with other factors in order for you to develop symptoms. NSB: Does Alzheimer's discriminate on the basis of sex? Bernick: it is commonly said that alzheim - er's disease affects women slightly more than men, though this idea has been challenged recently. definitely more women die from alzheimer's. Part of the explanation might be that generally a woman's life expectancy is five years longer.NSB: One of the more controversial and popular beliefs was the suspected role of aluminum as a factor in Alzheimer's. Bernick: it has been found that brains of individuals with alzheimer's disease contain higher levels of aluminum than age-matched controls at autopsy. However, this led to the theory that aluminum may be somehow toxic to the brain and cause alzheimer's disease. This theory could not be substantiated by a number of ensuing studies. There is no con - clusive evidence of aluminum contributing to alzheimer's . NSB: How much progress are we making in developing a reliable diagnosis? Bernick: This is a very exciting field of de - velopment in which the university of Nevada School of Medicine is participating. Currently, we are involved in a nationwide study compar - ing several types of imaging techniques, along with blood and spinal fluid constituents as markers of early diagnosis of alzheimer's disease. NSB: What is the life expectancy for an Alzheimer's patient? Bernick: From the time of diagnosis to death, the duration of alzheimer's can be as long as 20 years. Best current data suggests that the average length of time is somewhere from four to eight years. NSB: What is the current protocol in treat - ing Alzheimer's? Bernick: There are a number of drugs including aricept, exelon, razadyne and Namenda that can delay the progression of alzheimer's symptoms. in addition, there is indirect evidence that lifestyle interventions may be helpful such as regular exercise, keep - ing mentally active and eating a diet rich in antioxidants. NSB: A recent study sponsored by the Al - zheimer's Foundation of America reported that the disease is often untreated among minorities.Bernick: What that survey revealed is that african- american and Hispanic families who have relatives with alzheimer's are far more likely to dismiss their own symptoms as part of the aging process, thus decreasing chances for early diagnosis and treatment. NSB: Currently there is a popular theory that mind games such as puzzles or Scrabble, may stave off Alzheimer's. Bernick: We know that higher levels of education reduce one's risk of alzheimer's dis - ease. There have also been studies that suggest staying mentally active and having rich social networks also may have a protective effect. NSB: You are part of the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute that is charged with helping to unlock the mysteries of this disease. Bernick: The ruvo institute, named in honor of longtime and beloved las vegan lou ruvo, was brought to life as a partnership between private and public interests. under the leadership of larry ruvo, we have broken ground for a 67,000-square-foot facility in las vegas designed by internationally acclaimed architect Frank Gehry. Faculty from the uni- versity of Nevada School of Medicine, along with other talented scientists recruited from within Nevada and throughout the country, will direct the clinical and research activities with the goal of finding better treatments and ways to deliver care to those with alzheimer's, Parkinson's, alS (lou Gehrig's disease) and Huntington's. NSB: What role has the Nevada Legislature played in supporting Alzheimer's research? Bernick: Nevada has been a major sup - porter of our program and the ruvo institute. The Nevada legislature has appropriated $800,000 toward physician and staff salaries. Former Gov. Kenny Guinn and the legislature also announced a $ \u00182 million pledge to the School of Medicine in support of research and operational expenditures related to the school's partnership with Keep Memory alive, a las vegas-based non-profit organization dedicated the fight against memory disorders. nNNevada Silver & Blue Summer 2007 \u00183By John Trent '85/'87, '00M.A. Both Sudeep Chandra and Zeb Hogan can trace the beginnings of what they do today to what they did years ago, as children growing up in different parts of the country. For Chandra, it was the creek running in the backyard of his childhood home in Nor - man, Okla. \"We'd go out and catch catfish in the backyard,\" Chandra, an assistant professor in the department of Natural resources and environmental Sciences, says. \" at the time, i remember thinking, ' uh, i don't want to catch catfish or bass.' But that surely must've left an impression on me. it had to.\" For Hogan, who spent his college sum - mers as an undergraduate at the university of arizona as a field technician for the arizona Fish and Wildlife research Cooperative, the first connection with the natural world and wanting to learn more about it began much earlier. \"When i was a child, i used to tape nature shows on television and then watch them early in the morning, before anyone else in my family woke up or wanted to use the T v,\" he says. From those first vivid experiences \u2014 a time of discovery and wonder that all children ex - perience, but then, more often than not, lose to the pressures of adulthood \u2014 has come one of the university's most productive research partnerships. it is a partnership that has not only gar - nered the university headlines in publications such as The New york Times or on televi - sion on National Geographic , but promises something far more lasting for the freshwater fish of the world, as well as for the fish of lake Tahoe and the Truckee river. Working in concert, Chandra and Hogan are in the midst of a three-year project that focuses on the study and conservation of the world's giant freshwater fish. in all, the project will include expeditions to about a dozen of the earth's most diverse freshwater ecosys - tems. The two youthful researchers \u2014 both are in their early 30s \u2014 have known each other since their days of taking graduate courses together at uC-davis more than decade ago. They are collecting information about the life history, population status, geographic range and threats associated with each giant fish species. They will then synthesize this information into assessments and analyses of population and distribution trends over time.The fish they are studying include the mightiest of them all, the Mekong giant catfish, officially the world's largest river fish. The Mekong catfish has tipped the scales at more than 660 pounds and can grow to more than \u00180 feet long. it is part of the world's most productive freshwater fishery, which stretches for more than 2,600 miles along the Mekong delta in Cambodia. Not surprisingly, because of the impact of native fishermen \u2014 the fish is a prime food source for the people of the delta \u2014 the Mekong catfish has been categorized as \"critically\" endangered by the World Conser - vation union. \"Freshwater biodiversity conservation \u2014 including animals like the Mekong catfish, river dolphins and otters \u2014 is every bit as im - portant as the protection of animals like tigers and whales, perhaps more so,\" says Hogan, a united Nations Councillor for Fish and as - sistant research professor in natural resources and environmental science at the university. \"This project will also allow us to also meet with scientists and fishermen, participate in biological studies and inventories, talk with local people about their unique way of life, and investigate the causes behind the global loss of freshwater biodiversity.\" For people living in reno, the connec - tion between a freshwater fishery such as the Truckee river and one in Cambodia might seem tenuous. Not so, according to Chandra.Chandra says some of his work at lake Ta - hoe \u2014 where he has studied how non-native species such as the Mackinaw have impacted the ecology of the lake \u2014 can provide impor -Catching the means saving thousands more fish for Nevada scientists'big one' Photos Courtesy of Zeb Hogan Nevada researcher Zeb Hogan has traveled throughout the world to help save freshwater fish, including the Mekong fish.Nevada Silver & Blue Summer 2007 \u00184Nature & Environment John Trent, '85/'87 , '00M.A., is a University public relations directortant context in understanding the connection. \"Our lessons from Tahoe can be transferred to a river or lake in Mongolia or russia, where we have a project designed to conserve the world's largest trout, which is up to seven feet long and more than 200 pounds,\" he says. \"We can go there and say, 'We can help you recover or protect your river. Here are some lessons learned from our studies at lake Tahoe or on the Truckee river that might help protect your river, its water quality and biodiversity, as you develop the watershed. \"and, the reverse can also be true. We can take lessons learned from how a system works in its entirety, a system that has had some minor disturbances in a far-off place and then come back to Nevada and say, 'This is what our systems in Nevada must've looked like \u001850 years ago before there were major alterations to our landscape from mining and overgraz - ing, and this his how we can restore them.'\" improving the world's biodiversity, or at least maintaining what already exists, are both important goals for the researchers. For Ho -gan, the freshwater fish study is an opportu - nity to shed light on an issue with life-altering implications for millions of people. \"i've had two major sources of funding move away from biodiversity study and conservation to focus on global warming issues,\" he says. \" in practical terms, it means that there is no longer anyone actively funding ecological work on the endangered fish species of the Mekong. \"For readers in Nevada, this may not sound so surprising, but when you consider that the Mekong river is the most productive freshwater fishery on earth, supporting more than 60 million people, the lack of focus on the ecology and conservation of Mekong fish is shocking. \"This same situation is being played out in many poorly studied aquatic systems world - wide.\" Hogan, a former World Wildlife Conserva - tion Fellow, likens the huge fish he studies to \"gentle giants.\" \"despite their size and tremendous strength, the giant catfish isn't an aggres - sive fish,\" says Hogan, who also has a role in three of Chandra's studies with direct ties to Nevada. \" it is a toothless algae eater that, left unmolested, is shy and avoids confronta - tion. i am always shocked by their gentleness sAVinG THE WORLD' s fREsHWATER fis H University researchers Zeb Hogan and Sudeep Chandra and Laurel Saito, assistant professor in the College of Agriculture, Biotechnology and Natural Resources, are involved with a number of efforts to save the world's freshwater fish.

He answers the question of why it is impor - tant to see if the lahontan Cutthroat Trout can be successfully reintroduced in the Tahoe- Truckee-Pyramid watershed in a thoughtful, more-than-simply-science way. \"Why do we care about our natives like the lahontan cutthroat trout?\" he asks. \"One might be a moral issue. From a more spiritual or religious aspect, if they are creations from some sort of higher being, then they're very special. We have to ask ourselves, ' do we want to lose them?' That's a personal question. \"There is also the more scientific ques -tion, as it applies to the fact that there is great biodiversity loss happening globally right now. Biodiversity is believed to affect how ecosystems function; it's the way systems purify and handle issues that are thrust upon them. One of the reasons why we need to think about reintroducing the cutthroat trout is it's an important fish that can help regulate components of the river such as fish and nutrient cycling. if we want our systems to function more naturally, then we want our native fishes to return.\" it is this type of gentle sensibility that makes Chandra and Hogan's work so special \u2014 the classic intersection between the duty of a scientist to further knowledge and the duty of a concerned citizen to take meaningful action.\"That's why i think it's such a good partner - ship,\" Chandra says. \"The interesting thing about Zeb is, he's got knowledge and expertise not only about large fish biology, but in some - thing just as important: he's got a knack for picking up on cultural nuances and putting the science in the context of conservation and recovery. \"i'm a limnologist, which is more or less a freshwater oceanographer; i'm constantly thinking about how the chemical, physical, biological and geological aspects of our rivers and lakes interact. So i end up crossing over and trying to integrate many disciplines. Zeb can come at a problem as a knowledgeable scientist but with a cultural touch to ask the question, 'But what does the fish mean to this culture?'\" nN The Mekong catfish has tipped the scales at more than 660 pounds and can grow to more than 10 feet long.

There weren't too many births to my knowledge at that time in the hospital. There were seven of us and I was the youngest. My older brother gave the orders. I remember he said, \"If I ever catch you smoking, I'm going to knock your head off.\" My mom and dad came from Lithuania and a bunch of the neighbors came from Poland and Italy. There was no such thing as English as a second language at that time. So they just learned in a hurry. I went to Pitt in fall 1943 with my friend Tom Kalmanir [a teammate of Trachok's in the 1946-' 48 Nevada backfield and NFL player with the Los Angeles Rams and Baltimore Colts]. I was 1 7 . We had practiced that summer, played the ' 43 season and then we went into the service with the U. S. Army Air Corps. I tried to get into the Navy at first, but I flunked the colorblind test. How I passed into the Air Force and Air Corps, I don't know. I was discharged in 1946. I wasn't interested in staying in. The idea was now we can go back to college. We checked on going to schools. We didn't want to go back to Pitt. We wanted something that had a campus. Pittsburgh had the Cathedral of Learning, 42 stories high, and they have a lot of classes in there. And then coach [Jim] Aiken from Nevada went back to Pittsburgh and rented a room at a hotel not too far from campus. He put the word out he was looking for players and talked to Tom about coming to Nevada. After we looked at several schools, Tommy said, \"Should we consider Nevada?\" He called coach Aiken and said, \"I've got another player here that would like to come out.\" Aiken never asked, \"What's his name? What position does he play? How big is he? He said, \"Just bring him.\" My mom thought I was out of my mind for wanting to come to a place called Nevada . People back East thought the place was still filled with hostile Indians. I never looked at football as a job. It wasn't like, \"God, I've got to go to work today.\" It was more of an opportunity. I played with the greatest people in the country. We were a very close-knit group and I felt very fortunate to have them as teammates. I coached Bishop Manogue's first basketball team in 1948-49 when I was still a student at the University, then got a job as the track coach at Reno High School. They knew I ran track here and the principal asked if I'd be the coach. That was R. Guild Gray ['35 (education) '48M.Ed]. He asked me if I'd be interested in being the football coach at Reno. I said, \"Yes.\" Later, I was walking up North Virginia and my Nevada teammate W hat I've Learned From a conversation with Pat McDonnell in April 2007. Trachok, 81, was a top Wolf Pack running back in football as well as a track and field athlete (1946-48), head football coach (1959-68), a track and field and golf coach, and athletic director (1970-86). Now University athletic director emeritus, Trachok was inducted into the Nevada athletics Hall of Fame in 1975 and named to the Wolf Pack football Team of the Century in 1998. Photo by John ByrneDick '49 (Secondary Education), '54M.A.Jim Wilson pulled his car over and yelled, \"Congratulations.\" I said, \"What for?\" He said, \"I heard you're the new football coach at Reno High.\" That's how I found out. When I coached football or basketball, I was the head coach. I wasn't the assistant. When I came into college coaching, I was the head coach. I was never an assistant. Being an assistant has a lot of merit. It would have helped. I knew nothing about recruiting. When I started coaching football here [in 1959], we didn't have any scholarships so that made it a little harder. I was worried about getting enough players. We could offer a tuition waiver, but in California they had that. We had one assistant coach who was the track coach and one who was the baseball coach. Coach [Chris] Ault gets here about 5:30 in the morning. When I was athletic director and he was coaching, I said, \"Take it easy a little bit.\" He said, \"What do you mean? We get here at 7 and we do this and then have practice, the team meets and we have training table, and then we have a meeting after and at 9 we're home.\" I said, \"Chris, that's 14 hours.\" It didn't bother him at all. That was a normal day and he still does it. I'm like a lot of people who get a little older, the ones who can remember something from 40 years and don't remember where they parked their car today. I'm getting in that category a little bit. I don't fear death. I'm hoping that I don't have time to think about those things. But you have to be smart enough to know that nobody lives forever. The time comes for everybody.T rachok LOOK OnLinE For the full story with Dick Trachok, visit http://www.unr. edu/nevadasilverandblueNevada Silver & Blue Summer 2007 \u00188 Coach Historian Teammate Husband Friend Teacher Father Grandfather Athlete Storyteller Athletic director Coffee-klatch keeperThe greenhouse effect is what happens when certain atmospheric gases trap energy that otherwise would be lost to space. This effect is natural and supports life, but human activities have caused some of these gases to increase artificially, leading perhaps to climate change. in February 2007, the intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \u2014 top scientists from many countries \u2014 declared that human activities since the industrial revolution have likely caused global warming. That group wasn't the first to weigh in on mankind's effect on climate. Scientists began to theorize about global warming as far back as the \u00189th century with Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, a French math - ematician and physicist, who postulated in an \u0018827 essay that atmospheric gases might affect the planet's temperature. Svante ar - rhenius, a Swedish chemist, made reasonably accurate calculations about global warming in \u0018896. He developed a theory that varying levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could raise the temper - ature of the surface of the earth and account for prehistoric ice ages. To understand global warming, we need to start at the source: the sun. Sunlight is the primary heat source for our planet. The sun heats the earth, the earth transfers that heat to the atmosphere. The surface of the sun emits radiation at a temperature of around \u00180,000 degrees Fahr - enheit. lucky for us the sun is far enough from the earth that our surface temperature is somewhere around a balmy 53 degrees F at ground level. But it's not just the distance that keeps our planet at such a human-friendly temperature. The earth's surface is warmer than 0 degrees F because it is heated by both sunlight and infrared light emitted by the atmosphere. Gases that emit and absorb infrared light are perhaps more properly called \"infrared active gases\" because their molecules vibrate and rotate when they are stimulated by infrared light, producing heat. Contrary to popular belief, the primary greenhouse gas is not carbon dioxide, but ordinary water vapor. Water vapor is the most important in - frared active gas in our atmosphere because it absorbs and emits infrared light at most wavelengths. Clouds are also very active infrared absorbers and emitters, and they also scatter a lot of sunlight back to space that would otherwise heat the surface. in order, the major greenhouse gasses are water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone. But carbon dioxide is the gas that we humans not only have the most power to control, but which also is largely responsible for the recent warming trend. We also have some control over methane and ozone gases. Ozone, it should be noted, is a reactive gas formed when three oxygen atoms bond together. Ozone in the stratosphere is a good thing because it absorbs uv light that would otherwise kill plants and animals on earth. The issue with ozone depletion is that chloro - fluorocarbons destroy stratospheric ozone, so their use in propellants in spray cans and in refrigerators has been phased out in many places. Both ozone and chlorofluorocarbons contribute to global warming, albeit with less gusto than other molecules like water vapor and carbon dioxide. Gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles, coal-fired power plants and animals use organic molecules as fuel and give off, among other things, carbon dioxide and water va - por. Plants, rocks and oceans are depositories for some of the carbon dioxide. The National Oceanic and atmospheric administration has been making carbon dioxide measure - ments at Mauna loa in Hawaii since \u0018959. Carbon dioxide levels from before that time are inferred from measurements of air bubbles trapped in ice cores. Currently, out of \u0018 million air molecules, 380 are carbon dioxide. Fifteen years ago when i first started teaching at Nevada, the number was around 365, and in the year \u0018750, prior to the industrial revolution, the number was closer to 280. This number keeps going up because we keep burning coal, oil, wood and cow dung, and because nature also dishes out carbon dioxide from volcanoes. The global warming fuss is really about a few potent molecules. Suppose we instantly doubled the number of carbon dioxide molecules in the atmo - sphere? Not much would happen to the amount of sunlight initially absorbed at the earth's surface, but the atmosphere would now absorb and emit more infrared light, which in turn would heat up the land and oceans. This is why we are concerned about the levels of infrared active gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. earth's land and ocean surfaces effectively absorb infrared radiation, but they respond by evaporating more water vapor. land surfaces heat in a fairly predictable manner, but when oceans are heated they respond by circulating the Global warming \u2014 it's a gas...

The cycle changed with volcanic eruptions of infrared active gases. The devel - opment of agri - culture in the last 8,000 years may have produced enough methane and carbon dioxide to prevent us from sliding back into an ice age. But changes in the level of carbon dioxide and methane over the last 700,000 years are linked in lockstep with atmospheric temperature changes.

There are locations in Nevada where two points separated by very little distance receive vastly different amounts of precipitation. For example Mt. Rose and Reno in northern Nevada are separated by less than 20 miles. Mt. Rose however receives more than 25 inches of precipitation (rainfall equivalent) per year compared to Reno at less than seven inches. 2. Nevada is a great place to observe dust devils \u2014 tightly swirling winds created by extreme surface heating. During the summer months across Nevada, soil temperatures can rise well above 120 degrees Fahrenheit while the air above the soil is cooler (90-100F). This difference in temperature can spawn a dust devil that can produce wind speeds of more than 60 mph. 3. Many places in Nevada experience daily temperature ranges that are nearly unbelievable to observers in other regions of the country. For example, a normal July day in Washington, D.C., features a high temperature at 89F with a low of 71F , a daily range of 18F . Compare this to Elko, where a normal July day will see a high temperature of 91F and a low of 48F , a range of 43F . 4. Northern Nevada is the best location in North America to observe stationary lenticularis clouds (inset). These lens-shaped clouds form on the downwind side of the Sierra Nevada. Often lenticular clouds form in rows with a single, large lens-shaped cloud followed by many smaller stationary clouds. Since this formation of gleaming, saucer-like clouds lingers in the same location for long periods, many UFO and flying saucer reports have in fact turned out to be stationary lenticularis clouds. 5. Nevada is the driest state in the nation. When averaging precipitation totals from all of the reporting stations across the state, Nevada's statewide average is around seven inches per year. 6. According to the U.S. Historical Climatology Network, Nevada has the fewest weather observation stations of any state. Nevada does, however, have three National Weather Service forecast offices (Reno, Elko and Las Vegas) and is one of 36 states to have an Association of American State Climatologist-recognized state climate office. 7 . Although it is the driest state in the country, many parts of Nevada are prone to flooding. The Truckee, Carson and Humboldt rivers flood during heavy winter season rainfall or rain-on- snow episodes. Washes, roadways and streets in the southern portion of the state are at risk for flash flooding during summer thunderstorms. 8. During the heatwave of 2005, on July 19, the city of Las Vegas set two temperature records. The first was a new record high temperature of 1 17F . The second was a record for the highest nighttime low temperature, 96F . It was so hot that afternoon many aircraft at McCarran International Airport could not depart because the extremely hot air was not dense enough to allow for liftoff. 9. During a period from March 1928 through January 1929, the town of Mina went 312 consecutive days without recording a drop of rainfall. 10. Drought and wildfire are the most costly weather-related hazards facing the state. In 1994 wildfire and drought cost the state in excess of $1 billion.

Think about recycling your yard waste. Hav - ing a compost pile at home keeps green waste out of landfills and provides you with free compost. if you don't think you can compost at home or don't have a chipper, consider check - ing with your local landfill to see if it accepts untreated clean wood such as branches and pallets. These materials are typically ground up and used as wood chips in parks, although not all landfills are able to compost at this time.Simplify your life and be environmen - tally conscious by focusing on maintaining a healthy, rather than a perfect lawn. Mani - cured, baseball-field perfection requires too much water and fertilizer, too many pesticides and a lot of work. a healthy lawn is still lovely, is achieved with properly installed and effi - ciently scheduled irrigation, and is fertilized at the right time of year with the correct amount of fertilizer. also, consider mowing your lawn with a push mower or an electric mower. either uses less energy and creates less pollution than a gas lawn mower. a gas law mower used for one hour releases as many hydrocarbons into the atmosphere as a car driven for 50 miles.

Her basic expectations are that each team be competitive within the Western athletic Conference, with postseason play being the norm and not the exception. While excelling (and winning with reasonable regularity) in the conference remains the primary focus, she also has set a five-year goal of elevating the program from a regional focus to a national one. \" it is time for us to become recognized across the united States as a program that can compete successfully with the top programs in the country,\" she says. Groth's ambitious goal is compatible with the expectations of the univer - sity's new, high-energy president, Milton Glick. a high-quality, nationally recognized athletic program is but one part of his ambitious vision for the university that anticipates competing for academic honors with the nation's leading public universities. Glick sees the program providing positive national media exposure, as well as strengthening bonds with the alumni and com - munity. in meetings with athletics department staff, he has made it clear he appreciates a \"culture of competition,\" and that he expects coaches and athletes to conduct themselves professionally \"on the field, in the classroom, and in the community.\" Glick and Groth are thus of the same mind. Whether or not the program \u2014all sports, not just a select few \u2014make it to the elusive \"next level\" during the STOR Y bY DICK DAVIES PHOTOS bY JOHN bYRNE Continues next pageNevada Silver & Blue Summer 2007 25NSB: President Milt Glick has been working on finding the proper measuring stick for the University in terms of peer institutions. Who are some of our peers in the world of collegiate athletics? Groth: We measure ourselves with one or two programs in the WAC, many of the schools Dr. Glick uses in academic discussions, including some Pac 10 schools \u2014 Washington State, Oregon State. Those schools that have done well athletically, on and off the field, we look to as our role models or benchmarks. We also feel that people should be using what we do as a benchmark or a role model as well. next five years remains to be seen. But Groth believes that the program is now positioned to do just that. The women's programs have be - come highly competitive within the Western athletic Conference, with soccer, swimming and diving, and softball all garnering recent championships. and, in the past five seasons Kim Gervonsoni's arduous rebuilding effort has moved the basketball team from just three wins to 17 and a postseason National invitation Tournament berth. The men's basketball team has enjoyed a four-year run of unparalleled success that has included four NCaa tournament victories, and a revital - ized football program has earned postseason bowl bids the past two years, defeating Central Florida in 2005 and losing by one point to perennial national powerhouse Miami in 2006. The overall upward trajectory of the program is that Nevada claimed the Commis - sioner's Cup as the conference's top all-around performer for 2006-07. Most impressive of all is that for two years, the authoritative Penn State university-York report on the status of women's athletics has listed Nevada as best in the nation in overall compliance with federal gender equity mandates of Title iX. Competing successfully at the national level is both exhilarating and chilling. a visit with Groth tends to make the cautious observer appreciate that it just might be possible. Thirty years ago, such expectations would have been laughable. in 1979, the move in some sports from the smaller West Coast athletic Confer - ence into the Big Sky Conference seemed a daunting challenge. Thirteen years later, with football, baseball and swimming-diving providing the only consistently winning pro - grams, the Wolf Pack moved to a lower-tier division i-a conference, the Big West. When the opportunity to join the more prestigious Western athletic Conference presented itself in 1998, it was the university's academic quality and reno's geographic location, not the stature of its teams, that appealed most to conference officials. By that time, however, a fledgling \"mid- major\" sports program had been established on a strong foundation. The program had never been besmirched by a serious NC aa Groth helps Wolf Pack find its place on national landscape By John TrentOnly a few minutes into an interview with Cary Groth, director of intercollegiate athletics at Nevada, and it's obvious that this is a woman with a plan. \"I drive the people around here crazy with my charts and graphs, but I really do think it's an important part of mapping our future,\" says the energetic Groth, who just completed her third season at Nevada. She shows two visitors, including Richard Davies, professor of history at the University, a chart showing the progress of Nevada's women's basketball. \"I'm probably more of a visual person,\" she continues. \"We use charts and graphs and other things when we evaluate our coaches. Look at women's college basketball [the chart shows a number of peaks and valleys for the program since 1983]. The sport has not made the progress it needs to. But you can see that over the past four years, we're headed in the right direction. We have stability. We're on the right track. We do this for everybody, and the conversation becomes for every sport we have, 'How are we going to take it up here [her finger moves up and off the chart].'\" Photo by John Byrne The Wolf Pack's Jessica Wilcox leaps into teammate Aivi Luik's arms after scoring a goal against San Jose State Oct.29, 2006, as Randee Robinson looks on. Groth likes to smile, and is warm and personable. Every conversation she has, with practically every visitor who comes into her office on the top floor of Legacy Hall, begins and ends with a hug. She is also accomplished, having been named to the \"Super 50: Women's Sports Executives\" in Street & Smith's Sports Business Journal as well as the recipient of the National Association of Collegiate Women's Athletic Administrators Division I Administrator of the Year award. This is the kind of talk that this doer, this thinker, clearly relishes.Nevada Silver & Blue Summer 2007 26NSB: Should Nevada be in the Western Athletic Conference or the Mountain West? Groth: The Mountain West schools are a better fit to us institutionally, academically. They fit us better regionally, as well as competitively. The WAC is a hard conference to travel in. It's hard and it is expensive. We have to put our athletics program and our University in the best possible position for any opportunity that's out there, whether it's in the WAC or to explore other opportunities. NSB: In the 1990s, the University dropped men's track. One of the reasons given then \u2014 and some institutions continue to use this reason today as they drop men's programs \u2014 was that it was a Title IX decision so that the institution could comply with Title IX guidelines (prohibiting sex discrimination in federally assisted educational programs). Does that argument still have merit today? Groth: Regarding Title IX and the way some institutions explain why a certain sport is dropped or added, this is something I've never understood. We reach Title IX because of the proportionality we have here [in the number of female versus male student athletes]. Nationally, studies have shown that more than 80 percent of the institutions that drop men's programs use Title IX as the reason. When really, it was just what we did when we were at Northern Illinois [Groth was the Huskies athletic director, leading her alma mater from 1994 to 2004], when we dropped men's and women's programs ... the bottom-line reason was we could not continue to afford to maintain all those programs. But it was easy for our AD at the time to say, \"Title IX was the reason.\" The unfortunate end result is that Title IX is misunderstood. Individuals end up fighting the women on Title IX. They shouldn't be fighting the women on this. They should be fighting the men's \"arms race\" in basketball and football going on now. That's what is costing us the money right now ... the \"arms race.\" You've got to pay these bigger salaries, you've got to pay these bigger benefits and these incentives, just to keep up with the Joneses. If you told me I was going to be paying a coach a half a million dollars a year to coach \u2014 and he's still underpaid \u2014 you'd have to shoot me. NSB: What are some of your plans for facilities in the coming years? Groth: When we finish the academic center [ground was broken this spring for the Margarite Petersen-E.L. Cord Academic and Athletic Performance Complex, a 7 ,000-square-foot academic center with counseling, study halls and a tutoring center located next to the Robert Cashell Fieldhouse], our needs will be in basketball, tennis, soccer, track and swimming. I would also like to build an violation. President Joe Crowley insisted upon a strong commitment to the academic side of the program and worked closely with athletic director Chris ault and the Pack P aWS booster organization to assure that the wom - en's programs were fully funded. in 20 years at the helm, ault raised the funds required to provide division i- a quality facilities. Peccole Park pro - vided an attractive home field for Gary Powers' winning baseball program; a remodeled virginia Street Gym did the same for devin Scruggs' steadily improving volley - ball team; Mackay Stadium was expanded to 31,545 seats and a modern press box and revenue- producing private suites were constructed; Cashell Field House was linked to a state-of-the art physical training and therapy facility that ranks among the best in the nation; and legacy Hall was constructed to house the growing administrative and coaching staffs. The Crowley- ault emphasis upon academic and fiscal integrity has continued under the Glick-Groth regime. each head coach works under a contract that includes strong wording regarding compliance with NC aa regula - tions, academic achievement and the behavior of athletes on and off the field. Groth's files contain detailed charts tracking each pro - gram: long-term trends of team grade-point averages, graduation rates, budgets, as well as strength of schedule statistics, postseason invitations and won-loss records. Groth emphasizes national visibility in fu - ture football schedules. This fall the Wolf Pack opens the season on the road at Nebraska and Northwestern. Back-to-back visits to football-crazed lincoln and a Big Ten campus symbol - ize the national reach that Groth envisions for the entire program. \"We need to have much greater visibility in the Midwest,\" she affirms, anticipating it will provide fertile, new recruit - Dick Davies, University professor of history, is considered one of the country's foremost sports historians. His most recent book is Sports In American Life: A History (Blackwell of London), released in 2006.

Next year, Nevada hosts Big 12 opponent Texas Tech and travels to Missouri. in 2009, the Pack will open the season at Notre dame and play Missouri at Mackay Stadium. Men's basketball, of course, has already moved into that rarified level in the past few years, playing road or neutral-site games against Kansas, Connecticut, Gonzaga, California and uCla, in addition to tangling with Michigan State, Texas, Georgia Tech, illinois and Mem - phis in the NC aa tournament. This coming academic year, Groth will over - see a 17-team program with a budget of $15.5 million. While that figure might shock those who remember the lean times of yesteryear, it is a relatively paltry amount when compared to the budgets of programs that Groth anticipates will dot future schedules. it is recognized that football ticket sales have to be substantially increased, that membership in the booster club needs to grow exponentially, and that major donors have to be cultivated. Groth is working hard on all of those fronts, acknowledging that substantially increased funding is essential to underwrite a nationally competitive program.

Nevada outscored runner-up Boise State by seven points. For the second consecutive year, Nevada also earned a best in the nation listing in providing opportunities for women in sports, according to the fourth annual Gender Equity Scorecard. The report, developed by Charles Kennedy, a senior political science instructor at Penn State University-York, ranks schools based on their compliance with the spirit and intent of Title IX, the 1972 federal law designed to give women equal opportunity in sports. indoor and outdoor tennis facility [at the site of Christina Hixson Softball Park, formerly Bishop Manogue High School]. It's a great place for a public tennis facility, because it would be an off-campus facility. It would be four to six indoor tennis courts and eight to 12 outdoor courts, maybe done in phases. The beauty of this project is we could open it up and it could generate revenue for the program, not just for tennis, but for the athletics program. NSB: How would you assess attendance at Mackay Stadium? Groth: In 2004, we averaged 9,800. In 2005, we averaged 15,200, so we made our NCAA Division I-A [attendance provision] and this year it was 16,800. Those aren't great improvements, but I'm happy with them. I think scheduling plays a huge part in this. We have a home-and-home with Texas Tech including a 2008 game at Mackay, we have a home-and-home with Missouri as they come to Reno in 2009, we're hoping to schedule a really good basketball series, a 2-for-1, with North Carolina. You've got to bring in quality opponents. We're always going to draw well for a home UNLV game. We've changed the game times so that we don't compete with the Reno Air Races, so we don't have day games and compete with the community events. And I'll tell you what. Chris throws a party when he coaches. That's exciting football that the team plays. NSB: What are your feelings about coaches' salaries? You mentioned an \"arms race\" earlier in terms of escalating coaches' salaries. Are you arming for it? Groth: No, because I'm broke [laughs]. I think if there is anything that would drive me out of this business, it would be that. It doesn't make sense to me. There are football coaches making $4 million annually. Why? And what does that do to the academic community? It just doesn't make any sense to me, and it sends the wrong message to our kids, to our community, and certainly, to our faculty. We try so hard to bridge that gap, and one move like that, you can throw it all out the window. That's the core of what we do. We forget that athletics is part of an institution of higher education. That's why our location today is so important in relation to the rest of the campus. [Groth looks out the window at all the construction for the Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Center and Joe Crowley Student Union]. This [the new academic center] will bring the academic community and athletics together in a facility that truly will be used for academics. There may be a message there, too. We designed it in such a way with the student union in mind. How does it blend? How can we welcome people to an athletic facility, so there's not all these gates, locks, and things like that. It sends a statement.There are exciting things currently in the works: Construction began in spring 2007 on an expansion of Cashell Fieldhouse to include an academic performance center. On the recently acquired land that once was the Manogue High School campus, the Hixson Softball Park opened March 29, and Groth is hopeful that it will soon be joined in Wolf Pack Park by a new track and field complex and an indoor-outdoor tennis facility that will provide a proper setting for the rapidly improving men's and women's teams as well as providing memberships for the northern Nevada community. She is anticipating con - struction of a much-needed indoor practice facility for basketball, and with pressure mounting for other uses for the Virginia Street Gym, a state-of-the-art volleyball center. Groth is hopeful that additional programs can be established. There are currently 11 women's and seven men's sports, and she says that reinstating men's track and field, dropped as a money-saving measure in 1995, is her highest priority. She is also hopeful that men's volleyball and soccer can be added. Many fans look to the day when Nevada and UNLV compete in the same conference. Right now, the frenetic period of conference realignment seems to have abated, but Groth is poised to make a move if the right opportu - nity comes along. Although she is comfortable with the far-flung Western Athletic Confer - ence, she laments the expense and missed classes due to extensive travel (Louisiana Tech to the southeast, Hawaii to the distant west). She expresses interest in finding a conference home where Nevada would be more closely as - sociated with comprehensive, doctoral-grant - ing state universities that offer research-in - tensive academic programs. The logical move, fans suggest, would be to the Mountain West, home to the likes of New Mexico, Utah, Colo - rado State and yes, UNLV. Groth suggests, in all seriousness, that while the Mountain West might be the logical next stop, Nevada is actu - ally better suited academically, geographically and athletically for membership in the Pac-10. Now that would be taking it to the next level. nNNeVA d A Si LV e R & B LU e Summer 2007 28beyond C O W S & C O O K I N G Nevada's 4-H clubs expa Nd to teac H a Nd pHysics \u2014 but you Ng people still raise calves a Nd make pi es, too story by d eidre p ike '98, '02 m.a.

When adults sometimes resisted change, 4-H leaders taught children new ways to farm. The success was contagious. \"The youth did demonstrations, showing these methods worked,\" Benesh explains. \"Then adults adopted the ideas.\" The program's start was slowed by World War I, though 4-H achievement days were held in reno during this time with war saving stamps awarded as prizes. The 1920s saw the advent of Nevada's 4-H camps and Junior livestock shows. during World War II, 4-H club members helped war efforts by collecting salvaged metal. One club reportedly gathered enough scrap to build four tanks for u.S. Forces. Nowadays, about 50,000 young Nevadans participate in clubs and after-school pro - grams. Traditional \"cows and cookies\" 4-H clubs still thrive in some areas. In Fallon, young people might raise animals, garden, sew, learn food preservation techniques \u2014 and use high-tech GPS units. Operation Military Kids offers training and programs for young people at military bases like Nellis aFB. Other 4-H programs include Collegiate The young people crisscross the Churchill County Fairgrounds, learning to use hand - held Global Positioning System units. Then they make high-tech maps with Geographic Information System software. No, this isn't the annual Bill Gates Jr. Geek-Out Festival. It's a new 4-H club geared to geospatial technology. That's right \u2014 4-H club. The Churchill County Technology Team represents the contemporary face of Nevada 4-H, a univer - sity of Nevada Coopera - tive Extension program more historically linked, perhaps, with state fair pie-baking contests and the raising of goats. In Fallon, the 4-H Technology Team members go on GPS scavenger hunts \u2014 using the unit to locate geographic coordinates and record what they find there. They also \"lay tracks,\" logging their paths on the GPS units. \"These kids are coming from a digital gen - eration,\" says Carol Benesh, Nevada 4-H youth development specialist. \"They're ready and set to go with this. They love to play with gadgets.\"The teens put newfound skills to work de - veloping emergency management tools for the community. This summer, they plan to use GPS units to record locations of fire hydrants in Churchill County. They'll log locations and note physical surroundings, combining this info with water flow statistics to create a layered GIS map. \"We can map fire hydrants to create a digi - tal rendition of where resources will be for fire fighters,\" Powell says. \"Sometimes there'll be a fire hydrant put inside a fence. By looking at a digital map, we'll know where a fire hydrant is \u2014 and if there are any blocks to access.\" That may sound complex. But 4-H leaders are confident teens can not only manage these skills \u2014 they can help adults catch on. \"a lot of the kids are way ahead of where we are \u2014 they teach us,\" Powell says. \"These kids live tech every day. They're taking that interest and doing some amazing things.\" adult-youth partnerships. learning new skills. Helping the community. These ideas are nothing new for 4-H. They've long been part of the club's mission: \"To make the best better.\" * * * Cooperative Extension, 4-H's umbrella organization, was founded as part of the u.S. Smith- lever act in 1914. That year saw the 1900 1920 1940Cooperative Extension was founded nationally in 1914 as part of the federal Smith-Lever Act. In Nevada that year, its first employee, Norma Davis, was hired to give home demonstrations and supervise 4-H club work. The first State Fair was held in Fallon in 1914. By 1916, the present emblem, the 4-H clover, was well-known. Boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 20 were growing crops, raising livestock or poultry, making clothes, canning, keeping records and entering their projects for awards.During World War I, enrollment dipped slightly, but 4-H Club Achievement Days were still held in Reno. Members displayed their clothing projects on lines between trees. Then, war saving stamps were awarded as prizes. In 1923, the first State 4-H Club Camp was held at the University's livestock farm south of Reno. Five years later, the first Junior Livestock Show was held near San Francisco, with Nevada beef as part of that event. 92 years of 4-H history Deidre Pike is a freelance writer and writing lecturer in the University of Nevada, Reno's Reynolds School of Journalism.

The 4-H clubs, working in col - laboration with the 21st Century Community learning Center, meet after school four days a week for science and junior leadership in - struction at several local elementary schools.Today, mirrors and flashlights are placed on low round tables in a Grace Warner classroom. Students jockey for chairs in front of these tools. The kids are working through a 4-H curriculum unit called \" lights and lighting.\" leading this hands-on exercise are two university students and a half-dozen youth leaders, fifth- and sixth-graders trained to help. \"Today, we're going to learn about light be - ing reflected,\" says Jennifer Spindler, a Nevada senior psychology major. \"Who knows what kinds of things reflect light?\" \"a shadow?\" one young boy offers. \"Well, a shadow blocks the light, right?\" Spindler says, patiently. \" remember we learned that light always travels in a straight line? What reflects light?\" \"a mirror?\" one girl says, looking at one on the table. \"That's right, mirrors reflect light.\"\"a watch?\" \"Sometimes metal and glass \u2014 like in a watch \u2014 reflect light.\" \"I had a toy laser,\" says Jesus Martinez, 7. \"It went up to the ceiling.\"The experiment requires two kids working together on the carpeted floor in a dimly lit room. One holds a mirror upright on a paper printed with a mirror \"maze.\" The other shines the light at the mirror from various angles. The young people draw the lines of reflection on the paper to complete the maze. Martinez shines a flashlight. Holding a mirror is Paloma Palomares, 8, whose hair is pulled back into a neat ponytail. The light held by Martinez glints off Palomares' gold hoop earrings. Metal reflects light. Though science isn't her favorite subject, Palomares enjoys the experiments. Her fa - vorite activity involved filling water balloons. What might she be doing if she weren't in 4-H? She considers this. \"Watching TV ,\" she says. Paloma's big sister, Jennifer Palomares, 12, is a youth 4-H leader in training. She quietly watches another pair of pupils problem-solve.

One club brought in enough scrap iron in its drive to build four tanks for the armed forces.In the post-war era, 4-H clubs flourished, maintaining many of the original agriculture projects, but also adding projects of interest to many of our urban youth. Today, nearly 50,000 young people each year in Nevada learn life skills in clubs, schools and after-school programs.

Palomares explains: \"We want to help the kids understand reflection.\" The idea is to make science as fun as pos - sible, Spindler says. They've worked through units like nutrition, where kids learned to examine nutrition information on packaged products. \"One day after that, I watched the kids sit down with snacks and they were reading the labels,\" Spindler says. \"That was really cool.\" during a unit on \"Heat and Heating,\" the kids were testing the temperature of water. When a thermometer was placed in too-hot water, it broke. \"Now they want to know, 'When are we going to blow something up again?'\" Spindler says. These kids are eager to learn, Spindler says. The 4-H Clubs meet that need. \"We're not just out there raising pigs and cows.\" * * * For young people who spend months raising a goat or hog, it's a big moment: the Nevada Junior livestock Show at reno's live- stock Event Center. It's a Saturday morning in May and the 4-H clubbers prepare to show their animals. Young people, wearing pressed denim, starched white shirts and green 4-H ties, line up to show shorn lambs. Suddenly one animal breaks loose from the line. a young girl sheepishly gives chase, kick - ing up fresh wood shavings. \"There goes her showmanship score,\" says Joann Elston '56 (home economics), an who's watching from the gazebo in mid-ring. Elston, 73, has been involved with 4-H since her youth in Carson City. Her son and daughter were involved in 4-H, as were her three grandchildren. She's impressed with changes in 4-H over the years. The program evolves to teach new life skills to new genera - tions \u2014 yet never loses touch with its roots. raising animals teaches young people re - sponsibility, showmanship and camaraderie, Elston says. It prepares them for life. Since animals raised by kids are sold the last day of the show, some junior club members find the event traumatic. as they mature, young people begin to appreciate earning a profit.Elston, a Nevada alumna whose children and grandchildren all attended her alma ma - ter, recalls her daughter's first experience with livestock separation anxiety at age 9. \"She came running to me in tears and said, 'Make daddy buy Pablo back,'\" Elston says. \"I said, 'You just earned $900 \u2014 that's one semester at Nevada.'\" * * * In decades past, the 4-H cloverleaf emblem was as recognizable as the Nike swoosh is today. Times have changed, Benesh says. during a recent branding study, people were asked to rate how they felt about clubs like Scouts, Big Brothers and Sisters and 4-H. \"When it came to 4-H, people may not have known what youth activities and training are part of 4-H,\" Benesh says, \"even though the 4-H clover is a well-known logo. We do need to take the time to share information on the good work we do.\" at Vaughn Middle School in reno, the 4-H rocketry club meets Wednesdays after school. \"What does 4-H stand for anyway?\" asks Michael lafferty, 14. He and Simrri Medina, 14, sit at a cafeteria table, designing a catapult out of plastic straws, Popsicle sticks and rub - ber bands. When done, the eighth-graders will launch marshmallows across the room. Emily donaldson, who graduated from the university in december 2006 with a biology degree, doesn't answer their question directly. \"What do you think 4-H stands for?\" she asks.\"Health? Humor?\" lafferty suggests. \"Hypnotic,\" Medina adds. The teen boys seem absorbed by their task. \"We're learning about the laws of motion,\" Medina explains. \"Everything we do here has to do with science.\" \"I'm like Bill Nye the Science Guy,\" lafferty says, joking. \"It's fun. We got to roll soup cans down a ramp and clock the speed of soup.\" \"Chicken broth,\" Medina clarifies. The rolling-soup-can experiment demon - strated Newton's Second law of Motion: Mo - mentum is the product of mass and velocity. The boys take turns going outdoors to spray paint rockets built from kits. lafferty will at - tend Wooster High next year, where he plans to work on an advanced Placement diploma. He says he'd like to attend the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. donaldson approves. \"I like these guys,\" donaldson says. \"I love science and always have \u2014 and I want to pass that along.\" She was disappointed that no girls signed up for the rocketry club. a few girls show up during the club to watch lafferty, Medina and the others at work. \"Michael, let's go do something,\" one girl pleads with lafferty. \"I'm doing this now,\" he replies. \"We'll do something when I'm done.\" Back inside, the boys complete their cata - pult and test it by launching paper clips. donaldson explains what 4-H stands for: \"Head, heart, hands, health.\" \"What does that have to do with this class?\" lafferty asks, off-handedly. He's perhaps more interested in another question. \" remember when we used magnets to make the cans spin? do you think you could use that kind of energy to power a car?\" nN Photo by Jean Dixon JoAnn Elston has been involved with 4-H since her youth in Carson City.

NEVada S IlVEr & Blu E Summer 2007 34Thirty-four students came to the newly founded Davidson Academy of Nevada in August 2006 from throughout the United States, and one arrived from Australia. Their ideas, aspirations and abilities to solve problems make these 11- to 17-year-old independent thinkers and doers \u2014 who once frustrated school administrators with their brilliance \u2014 a source of intellectual energy. The students' mere presence makes the three classrooms in the KNPB Channel 5 building at the north end of campus hum with a feeling of community, and of growth. \"These kids are bright enough that they could blast through the subjects really quickly. But we're trying to teach the kids to learn deeper more than quicker,\" says academy co-founder Bob David - son. \"We've taken the approach that we're going to move as quickly as appropriate for the students. But we also want to have them learn deeply, so that students have a greater understanding.\"Davidson Academy students enjoy fruitful first year Continues next pagebrilliance Photo by Jean Dixon The Davidson Institute has received national media attention, from a New York Times feature to a profile in a CNN special. ABC Nightline reporter John Donvan interviewed Bob and Jan Davidson in Morrill Hall on the University campus. His report on The Davidson Academy of Nevada, \"'Profoundly Gifted' Students Find Home in Reno,\" aired June 4, 2007. Blooming By Pat McDonnell & John Trent, '85/'87, '00M.A.Nev ADA Silver & Bl Ue Summer 2007 35Davidson and his wife, Jan, fund the nation's only state-supported, free public school for profoundly gifted students. These students have intelli - gence quotient levels at approximately 145 and above, and tested at one-tenth of 1 percent of the highest ability level throughout the country. They are the brightest of the bright. And they're all coming back to resume their studies for the 2007-08 academic year. Thanks to Bob and Jan Davidson's $15 million gift creating the on- campus Davidson Mathematics and Science Center, the academy will move to the Jot Travis Building \u2014 closer to the academic center of the campus \u2014 in fall 2008. What follows are three profiles of the many success stories to have developed within the Davidson Academy in its first year. These are students who have traveled from as far away as Australia. And they are students who literally can trace their youth to this campus. in sum, they represent students with boundless potential. Students who have, happily, found a home. AS W iNTer TUrNeD iNTO SPriNG Down Under, Max Oswald- Sells, 12, was a comfortable only child with untapped potential living at his home in New South Wales with his mother, Gael. He had studied at a start-up school for gifted children in his native country, but his mother, now an algebra teacher at reno's Coral Academy of Science, knew that a boy who taught himself to read at 3 would come home from his classes in hometown Sydney saying, \"This is a waste of time.\" \"Max has special needs,\" Gael says. \"That's why we're here. it was a case of seeing what else was out there. Some might say it was a radical move to come here, but parents with a child with a special gift, for example in ballet, might seek out a special school. The Davidson Academy was too good of an opportunity to pass up.\" On leaving his homeland before his teens, Max says, \"We felt that we might as well give it a try. it'll be an experience.\" Max displays the self-confidence and analytical mind of a boy who has matured before his time. He reaches for a hearty intellectual challenge like some kids his age would grab a juice drink in their cafeteria. if he had more time, he'd more fully study military history \u2014 especially the ways military lead - ers effectively coordinate combat arms. He's doing his spring semester project on a book he's read 10 times, Christopher Duffy's Fire and Stone , which describes the history of artil - lery fortification from 1660 to 1860. Max might write his own book on the subject before the decade is up. He's not perfect, as he admits to being a procrastinator in his academy studies. in Sydney, he says, there's not the huge emphasis on grades as there is here. There's no credit system at all. To graduate from high school in New South Wales, you have to pass the final exam. \"i'm a computer gamer,\" he says, when asked about his free time. \" i wouldn't mind being a game pro - ducer, especially to create games of strategy.\" Bob Davidson says students like Max, who are getting unique op - portunities for personalized study of subjects like cellular and molecular biology with University of Nevada School of Medicine researcher ruth Gault, are focusing their potential to achieve valuable breakthroughs in health, science, technology and the arts, at an extraordinarily young age. \"The University is a necessity for these children because we're able to make use of the wealth of campus resources in biology, math, english, and even student guidance,\" David - son says. Gael is happy to find a university and a free, public specialized school for prodigiously gifted children that allow Max to delve into his academic passions. But she and Max's Colo - rado-based father are not rushing Photo by Jean Dixon Davidson Academy of Nevada students Emma Schmelzer, left, and Rachel Ellison discuss an English paper with McKenna Rose, University English department lecturer.

Not when there are so many games to be played, and so many historic battles to be studied. eMMA SCHM elZer'S liFe HAS Alre ADY accelerated. Before she was 13, she had skipped the fifth and eighth grades in her hometown of Columbus, Mont. Things were mov - ing so quickly she attended her high school prom when most students are in the sixth grade. \"That was actually very fun, very cool,\" she says with a smile. \" i was the youngest person to ever go to prom.\" Yet now, after a year of attending the Davidson Academy, Schmel - zer would like to slow down. From the social aspect to academics, the experience of sharing learning with an equally talented cohort of students has been so positive, Schmelzer is in no hurry to move on to college. At least not for another year or two. \"i could graduate next year,\" she says, her voice measured with a matu - rity that seems to go well beyond her 14 years. \"But i don't think i'm going to. i'm enjoying the environment so much.\" And then, she pauses. Her eyes light, and her expression softens to that of teenager. \"i don't think i want to be going to college at 15 anyway,\" she says. \" i want to keep having fun here for a while longer.\" like all Davidson students, Schmelzer has taken advantage of the Davidson Academy's unique agree - ment with the campus, which allows the academy's talented students to rack up college credit in addition to their high school work. Schmelzer has impressed her college-level instructors with her preparedness. \"emma brought her laptop and set it up for note-taking at every session,\" says University philosophy department lecturer Guy Axtell, who taught World religions - a 200-level course - to Schmelzer in the spring. \" i wondered before the semester began if having a student of her age would present any special difficulties. What i found was that age certainly doesn't matter, as she was the top point-getter on the midterm.\" Axtell says Schmelzer, though she does look young, did not appear to be anything out of the ordinary to her col - lege classmates. That is, until one day. \"The other students were oblivious to the presence of a student so young, until the Tv cameras arrived one day to film her in class,\" he says. \"When the crew left, the students wanted to know why the camera was there, and i mentioned it was for emma. When someone asked how old she was and emma replied '14' it amazed them ... especially when i took the opportunity to point out that she was also the only student with a '100' on the exam.\" The move to reno with her parents hasn't been without shortcomings. Schmelzer loves the outdoors and open spaces of what writer Bud Guthrie long-ago dubbed The Big Sky Country of Montana. Columbus, not far from Billings, Mont., has a popu - lation of about 2,000 people. That population figure doesn't include the 18-stall horse arena that was on the Schmelzer's 20-acre property. \"We are horse owners ... we own 15 horses,\" says Schmelzer, an aspiring novelist who loves anything by J. r. Tolkien or Clive Barker.. \"We've always had between 20 and 2,400 acres, and i've always enjoyed living in the coun - try. i can remember being 8 years old and vowing never to live in a city.\" Schmelzer, whose mother, Kerry, is doing drinking water research for the University's Department of Natural resources and environmental Sci - ence, and whose father, lee, is work - ing on his master's degree in animal science, at the campus' College of Ag - riculture, Biotechnology and Natural resources, notes that the family brought \"four of our horses here at Christmas.\" She says the family's new home in the North valleys with a dog, two cats and a canary is called horse property ... \"it's an acre, but it's really only an acre of sagebrush.\" Still, the trade feels like it has been worth it. \"When i first heard about the Da - vidson Academy, it sounded like my dream school, and it really has been my dream school,\" says Schmelzer, whose activities include piano and singing. \"My peers have just been amazing. i'm not sure if there is a typical conversation that we have ... we talk about anything and every - thing. even though i miss Columbus, it's been a good move.\" All PAreNTS KNOW TH eir CHilD is special. But for Kambiz and Simi raffiee, the realization that their daughter, Misha, had intellectual abilities above and beyond the norm came earlier than most. \"From the time she was about one and half years old, her instructors were all saying that Misha had some very unique abilities, whether it was in music, art, drawing, painting, swimming,\" Simi says. When Misha was 4 and in kinder - garten, \"The facilitators wouldn't let me John Trent, '85/'87 , '00M.A., is a University public relations director. Pat McDonnell is a University writer/managing editor of Nevada Silver & Blue .Nev ADA Silver & Bl Ue Summer 2007 37read,\" Misha says. \"They insisted that they wanted to read the book to me.\" \"Her teachers came to me and they said, 'She reads!'\" Simi says. \" i remem - ber saying, 'Yes, i know. She has been able to read for quite some time.'\" Today, her first year at the David - son Academy behind her, Misha has continued to excel in ways that few could imagine when thinking of the average 12-year-old. earlier this year, Misha, who was about two and half years old when she started playing the violin, auditioned and earned a spot in the reno Phil - harmonic, becoming the youngest person to ever play for reno's most prestigious orchestra. \"Misha has always had a violin in her hand,\" Simi says. \"When she was 3, 4, 5, you would see her all day long with it, playing with it, composing songs in her head. She enjoys music so much.\" \"i've always felt that music was a part of me,\" says Misha, who learned violin from the University's finest player, the recently retired professor of music and former concertmas -ter for the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, Philip ruder. \" it's always kept my mind active. And it's always been a challenging endeavor for me, to constantly work on improving my playing.\" Kambiz raffiee, associate dean for the College of Business Administra - tion, Foundation Professor, director of the college's masters of business ad - ministration program and a Nevada faculty member since 1983, says that Misha's successes in music and in the classroom are a tribute to her native intelligence, hard work and Simi's endless encouragement. Kambiz is a gracious man who speaks and moves with an under - stated fluidity. He notes that Simi was a professional herself before they were married, working in the San Francisco Bay Area's world of finance. \"i'm always so impressed when Simi and Misha get together and schedule and plan their tasks for the day,\" he says. \" it's incredible. They have amaz - ingly busy days, it's not easy by any stretch, but they always manage to fit everything in.\"Simi says that if there has been one thing she has tried to bring to Misha's busy days, it has been a sense of bal - ance. \"it's a good challenge to have everything in balance,\" she says with a smile. Her voice lingers evenly over the word \"good,\" as if to emphasize that having an incredibly intelligent and talented daughter is not a burden, but a joy. \"For Misha, there are always various tasks that need to be completed in regard to her Davidson Academy and University classes, and she has limited time to do it. So you have to work wisely.\" Misha, who in her short life has learned five different languages, says the interaction she has had with students of similar abilities has been remarkable. \"Almost all the kids there are will - ing to stick up and be there for you,\" she says. \" it's interesting, too, because almost all of them feel that music could be something good in their lives, that it can contribute to their overall well-being. So there is a lot we have in common. \"One of the more significant char - acteristics of the Davidson Academy is they never say, 'No, you can't do this.' in many aspects, the sky is the limit at the academy. This has become a real - ity thanks to the vision and commit - ment of Mr. and Mrs. Davidson.\" Surprisingly, Misha doesn't antici - pate making a career in music. even with all the enjoyment she gets from playing classical music or her other favorite, jazz, she hopes to major in pre-med in college. \"i want to become a neurosurgeon,\" she says. And then, perhaps remem - bering that she has always been a student with boundless potential, without any real limits, she adds, smiling, \"But on the side play violin and piano.\" nN College of Business Administration Associate Dean Kambiz Raffiee and his wife, Simi, have enjoyed watching their daughter, Misha, progress this year as a student at The Davidson Academy of Nevada.

Bell began working on developing a compound known as \"CADA\" (Cyclotri - azadisulfonamide) more than a decade ago. The compound inhibits replication of HIV by eliminating the \"door handle\" by which receptor molecules on the surface of a white blood cell normally would grab HIV , allow - ing the virus to enter and infect the cell. \"There's no other drug like it,\" Bell says. \"If you look at the cell before and after it has been treated with the drug, you see some - thing truly remarkable. Before being treated with the drug, you can count the number of CD4 (surface receptor molecules for HIV) on the surface of the cell. If you treat the cell with the drug for a half a day, or a day, then the CD4 is almost gone. It's a completely novel mechanism of action in inhibiting replication of the virus.\" The rest of the research world is catching on quickly about Bell's breakthrough. Last year, one of Bell's articles made the list of the 100 most influential publications in the HIV/AIDS research field. Out of more than 10,000 such research publications in the world, Bell's article in the Journal of Medici - nal Chemistry was ranked at No. 90 \u2014 an amazing feat given that the keywords \"HIV\" or \"AIDS\" are not even in the article's title. Bell said that in the past few years, he and his research team have learned more about the compound and its properties. They have learned that very small amounts of the drug can protect the cell against HIV . Also, they have found that the compound's cellular toxic - ity on white blood cells is relatively low. This could mean that the therapeutic index that drug researchers use in evaluating side effects of a proposed drug could also be low \u2014 a good sign that humans could safely take the drug. \"Every drug is toxic, and the less toxic it is, the better,\" Bell said. \"It takes about 50 times higher the amount of CADA to cause toxicity on the white blood cells than it does to give it protection against HIV , which is a positive indication that we're headed in the right direction.\"Getting a handle on HIV/AIDS drugs Look onLine To find out more about the rankings, go to: http://www.ionchannels.org/newsletters / For a copy of Bell's article, go to: http://www.aidshivresearch.com / You can still read the weekly, newsprint edition of The Nevada Sagebrush and get a dust - ing of ink on your hands. Or, you can read the latest campus news online. Nevada's traditional student publications have followed the migration trend of news and in - formation to digital and electronic platforms. While the 59th edition of Brushfire , the state's oldest literary arts journal founded in 1950, was printed and distributed on campus this spring, an online version is also available. Artemisia , first published in 1898, has changed the most. Faced with dwindling yearbook and advertising revenue sales, student editors moved from the traditional yearbook format to a semester magazine format in 2005. Individual portrait photos of students are a thing of the past. This year, an online version of Artemisia was added. \"Even though the traditional aspects of a yearbook are not in the publication anymore, the magazine acts like a yearbook. It documents campus activities and community like the yearbook used to do,\" explained 2006-07 Editor Kevin Clifford. \" Also, magazines are more keep-able than newspapers are in that it's easy to take home a magazine and leave it on the book shelf.\" Student publications follow digital migration Look onLine: Find a history of Artemisia's early years, published in the 1917 yearbook, and links to online versions of today's The Nevada Sagebrush , Somers and his 1914 Artemisia staff (shown here) would never have imagined the magazine and digital format of today's publication.NEVADA S ILVE r & B LUE Summer 2007 40 University NewsA flurry of emails and well-wishes was sent from faculty, staff and students of the Reynolds School of Journalism to University graduate Alicia Parlette '04 (journalism) this spring when it was learned that she would be going on disability from her job as a copy editor at The San Francisco Chronicle . Parlette has written of her battle with cancer through a series of journal-like personal accounts called Alicia's Story in The Chronicle over the past two years. Parlette's's update in early March 2007 informed readers that the 25- year-old would be going on disability and the series would have a new home as a blog. On March 2, 2005, Parlette, then 23, was diagnosed with alveolar soft part sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that affects less than 200 people each year. In October 2005 Parlette returned to the Nevada campus to share her story as the 2005 Robert Laxalt Distinguished Writer, one of the school's most prestigious honors. Alicia's Story was published as a book, and Parlette was chosen as \"Person of the Week\" by ABC News. \"The reaction to the story was overwhelming,\" said Robert Rosenthal, managing editor of The Chronicle and the person who first asked Parlette to share her story with the publication's readers. He noted that within the first few weeks of the appearance of the series, more than 2,000 emails and letters were received by the newspaper. The Laxalt Distinguished Writer award is presented annually to accomplished Nevada writers. The award is in honor of legendary Nevada journalism professor Robert Laxalt \u2014 considered one of the state's finest and most influential writers. In her update in early March, Parlette noted that although she would be on disability, she would continue to write. \"This will be my last piece in The Chronicle , at least for a while,\" wrote Parlette, a summa cum laude graduate and recipient of a prestigious Hearst Fellowship. \"I'm going on disability \u2014 maybe for a few months, maybe forever \u2014 because I just can't work often enough to justify being a full-fledged employee of Hearst Newspapers (or anything, for that matter). \"It's not because I'm suddenly deteriorating; I just can't keep up with work. Since I have the opportunity to put work on the shelf in order to get more aggressive about prolonging my life, I'm going to take it. \"But I'm not disappearing. Writing this series has been everything to me these past two years. It has been my comfort object and my therapy; my emotional protection and my emotional pipeline; my loving retreat and my connection to the world. \"So that connection will continue. While my work won't be appearing in The Chronicle \u2014 or any other print publication \u2014 I will be writing a blog, 'Alicia's Story,' as a member of the public, at sfgate.com/community/blogs. I look forward to emptying my life onto the page, digital though it may be, and I thank readers in advance for following me into the blogosphere.\" One of Parlette's professors at Nevada, Warren Lerude '61 (journalism), perhaps said it best in an email to journalism school faculty and friends: \"Our hopes, prayers and power of our positive and supportive deep thinking are with you every minute, Alicia.\"'Alicia's Story' moves to the blogosphere Can a teacher make a meaningful con - nection with students by chomping on an orange or sit - ting on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? For Scott Mensing, chairman of the University's Department of Geography, that's the best way to create an environment of hands-on learn - ing, and it has resulted in a teaching \"triple crown.\" Mensing received the 2007 regents' Teaching Award, an annual honor pre - sented by the Nevada System of Higher Education to the professor throughout the entire system with the most distinguished teaching record. The award came on the heels of awards Mensing earned in 2005 and 2006: the LeMay Award for Excellence in Teaching, signifying the top instructor in the College of Science, and the F. Donald Tibbitts Dis - tinguished Teacher Award, the University's highest teaching honor. Mensing earned each award in his first nomination. To teach students how maps can be distorted, Mensing chomps on an orange and slams it on a desktop. To demonstrate the processes rocks go through from sedimentary to metamorphic, he sits on the sandwich. It's an attention-getting heat and pressure lesson, but it works. Mensing also holds office hours in the library rather than in his office. \"The library is the students' turf, after all,\" he says.

He still has nightmares about it, he tells the audience. Nearly 150 book lovers have come to hear Coake read from his debut collection of short stories, We're in Trouble . His appear - ance is the second in the \"Books & Authors\" series, sponsored by Nevada Humanities and the Nevada Center for the Book. Since the 2006 publication of We're in Trouble , Coake has received the presti - gious PEN/ robert Bingham Fellowship for Writers. Lire, a leading French literary magazine, named the French translation of We're in Trouble one of the 20 best books of 2006. The British magazine of new writing, Granta , named him as one of the top 21 \"Best of Young American Novelists,\" an honor bestowed each decade. The book has been published in the United States, Britain, Italy, France, and Germany, where it's in a third printing. His March 2007 presentation included references to his muse, his academic career, and his love of writing. Coake began by dictating stories to his mother, who wrote them in longhand. He illus - trated the fiction with crayons, stapled the pages together and passed them out to friends. Coake was six. \"I wrote all the way through junior high and high school. And, I did a disastrously brief stint as a journalist,\" he said. \"But, I kept coming back to fiction.\" During graduate school at Ohio State University, a professor introduced Coake to James Joyce's tour de force short story, The Dead , which he says changed his life and his writing. \"I began graduate school on September 16, 2001. I wrote the stories for this book at a time of personal and na - tional tragedy,\" he said, referring to the death of his first wife following a protracted illness and the attack on the World Trade Center. \" About halfway through graduate school, I had collected enough stories for the book,\" The panel judges who awarded Coake the PEN/ robert Bingham Fellowship wrote \"In all of these stories, and in practically every sentence that composes them, there is a germ of bland familiarity that, in Coake's hands, has been twisted into the strange, the new, and the alarming.\" \"You have to write what you know or, in my case, what you're afraid of. But I couldn't be an artist without an underlying sense of optimism. There's hope for the 'we' who are in trouble,\" he said.

The Center for Molecular Medicine, located on the north end of campus, will also be home to the Whit - temore Peterson Institute for Neuro-Immune Disease and the northern center for Nevada Cancer Institute. Ground was broken this past spring on the 100,000-square- foot, state-of-the-art facility, which will double the medical school's research and laboratory space. The center will house portions of the medical school's basic science research depart - ments and serve as home to pro - grams within the microbiology, pharmacology and physiology departments. The facility will increase the research productiv - ity of the school's faculty and assist them in attracting federal research grants. \"This new facility will significantly expand the School of Medicine's ability to advance the work of our basic scientists,\" said Dr. John McDonald, vice president of health sciences and dean of the medical school. \"Not only will we have the ability to expand our current basic science operation, but the building will allow us to develop new pro - grams in addition to providing space for our clinical faculty to conduct research.\" The center, visible from McCarran Boulevard, will also enhance the medical school's graduate student programs. Ac - cording to University President Milton Glick, breaking ground on the new facility is just one of the first steps toward expanding the School of Medicine. The Whittemore Peterson Institute, the first institute of its kind in the United States dedicated to finding a cure for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, will conduct research, treat patients and develop educational pro - grams for complex disorders of the immune system and brain.

Annually, the NSF's gift will provide three $4,000 schol - arships to undergraduate nursing students and two $2,000 scholarships to graduate nursing students. Lavina Atkinson, president of the NSF, created the scholarship in memory of Josef Waxler, the organization's founder. The gift is a fitting tribute to Waxler's life- long interest in education and in helping others. Its impact will be felt by both University nursing students and the entire health care community. The Orvis School of Nursing's mission includes service to the state of Nevada and to the professional community at large. It operates the Orvis Nursing Clinic, which provides a valu - able learning environment for Nevada nursing students and is particularly important to many who cannot afford or for other reasons have no access to quality medical care. Sierra Pacific Power Company has initiated an expansion of the sustainable energy curriculum in the University's College of En - gineering. Through an industry-education partnership, the college will develop an undergraduate educational program in sustainable engineering, along with a graduate research program located at the University's redfield Campus. \"Sierra Pacific has a long tradition of working with the Univer - sity's College of Engineering and the geothermal industry here in northern Nevada,\" said Sierra Pacific resources Chairman Walter Higgins. \"This unique industry-education partnership will not only further development of the renewables field, but should help serve the energy needs of Nevada far into the future.\" Ormat T echnologies has also partnered with the University by providing funding to help complete laboratory facilities at the redfield Campus. \"This is literally a field laboratory, and with this educational base for geothermal and renewable energy, we have the proverbial alignment of the stars here for students and the entire community,\" said Daniel Schochet, vice president of Ormat Nevada. The new program requires the hiring of faculty to lead the in - novative curriculum. Sierra Pacific Power Company has committed $500,000 over two years for two new professors in engineering. The goal is to catapult Nevada and the University into an alternative energy leadership role. \"We're grateful to Sierra Pacific and Ormat for helping to start this program,\" said University President Milton Glick at a recent program ceremony. \"Now we have to engage the entire business community in expanding this program into a multidisciplinary endeavor. We look forward to expanding this focus on renewable energy beyond engineering and science into our other schools and also engaging our colleagues in the Nevada System of Higher Education.\" To find out more about the Renewable Energy Program, contact Director of Development Melanie Perish at (775) 784-6422, or mperish@unr.edu.The late Professor Harry M.

She lives with her family in Kawachi (now Hakusan), Ishikawa in Japan. Ishikawa is a prefecture (district) on the Sea of Japan side of the main island (Honshu); Kawachi is a rural village among the mountains with a population of 1,000. Yuki was born and brought up in this village, which she describes as \"a great place of good water, air, food and people.\" Yuki is married to Vincent Raker '98 (psychology). They have two children: a daughter, Misa, who turns 6 in July, and a son, Issei, 4. Her website: http://fliwww.ge.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/yuki/index.html is in both Japanese and English. 1. What does it feel like to be the first doctoral graduate of the inaugural literature and environment program in the world? To be honest it was mere chance that I obtained the first Ph.D. in the field of literature and the environment. What is significant for me was being part of the first body of graduate students in the world's first literature and environment program. I joined the program in 1996; there were only a dozen or so students. We were all excited and nervous. We were the first and didn't have a precedent; we would become the model. We all shared that feeling, which created an intimate yet scholarly bond among us. Now I see the program at Nevada being recognized as the \"mecca\" for literature and environ - ment. 2. What is ecocriticism and what is it like being a professor of ecocriticism in Japan? I pretty much follow the definition pro - posed by Nevada English Professor Cheryll Glotfelty, who more than a decade ago said that ecocriticism is \"the study of the relationship between literature and the physical environment.\" \"Literature\" in this definition does not simply refer to literary works or other written documents; it en - compasses all cultural items including film, photography and music. I am at - tracted by ecocriticism's self-reflective and anti-methodological stance. As I just said, ecocriticism focuses not on a fixed entity but on the \"relation - ship\" between literature and the environ - ment. That is to say, ecocritics seek an alternative language that reflects human interdependence with the environment. But the difficult thing is that we do this by using the present language, of which we are critical. It is a challenging task and I'm always intrigued by the search for a language that could be used to discuss the interaction and interface between humans and the physical environment. As for being a professor of ecocriticism in Japan, I'm thoroughly enjoying it. I am an Americanist by profession, but recently I've been studying Japanese as well as East Asian environmental literature. Since issues of the environment are at once local and global, having a comparative perspective helps us develop a more inclusive and solid critical stance. This idea is shared by quite a few critics here. 3. How does Japanese environmental literature differ from American? Both American and Japanese environ - mental literature attempt to incite people's sensitivity and imagination so as to make society more sustainable. In other words, they try to provide you with a vision, a model or an ideal. A major difference, though, is that Japanese environmental writers often find their model in the past \u2014 a period of time before modernization. Many writers such as Ishimure Michiko direct our attention to the language and life before modernization, which are characterized as being closer to and more considerate of the environment, making us critically reconsider our present lives. 4. How did your experience at Nevada help define your approach to teaching? It fashioned me as a teacher in many ways. I'm grateful for having experienced the literature and environment professors' interactive styles and the importance of placing high expectations on students. One of my most vivid memories of classes is of Professor Michael Branch's American Renaissance class with an environmental emphasis. I was literally overwhelmed by the unbelievably huge load of reading and writing assignments he required of us. But I was really astonished by his detailed feed - back on students' performance as well. So his high expectation of us demanded a lot of him, too. It taught me that you need to work as hard as your students. I especially understand and appreciate that now that I'm teaching at a university. 5. Won't you be returning to the states on another Fulbright grant? Yes, I'll be at Stanford University with my family for six months in September 2007 . I'll do mostly research, both indoor and outdoor, examining soundscape in environmental literature. I am very grateful for this opportunity since my university \u2014 actually most universities in Japan \u2014 doesn't have a sabbatical system and it would be extremely difficult for me to take a research leave otherwise. The Fulbright program has been impor - tant in my career as a scholar. In addition to my first Fulbright grant, which enabled me to study in the Nevada program from 1996 to 1998, and this current grant, I would not have come to Nevada \u2014 or might not have become an ecocritic \u2014 if I hadn't met Professor Scott Slovic, who was in Japan as a Fulbrighter. I was a master's student at Kanazawa University when I had the opportunity to take Scott's class on American nature writing. This was really the door opening my interest in environ - mental literature. 5Questions With Melanie Robbins is an associate editor of Nevada Silver & Blue.NEVADA S ILVER & B LUE Summer 2007 51AlumniWolf Cubs Joanna (Kingsley) Daily '99 (general studies) and Craig Daily '99 (logistics) are pleased to announce the birth of their third child, Sarah Grace Daily, on Feb. 3, 2007 .

His final appointment as a ranger for the U.S. Forest Service was to the Ely District of the Ne - vada (now Humboldt) National Forest on the eastern border of the state from 1947 to 1959. In this interview, taken by the University of Ne - vada Oral History Program in 1990 , Murchie explains what it was like to round up mustangs on the open range and how overgrazing by the animal caused problems in land stewardship for rangers. What brought about the mustang prob - lem on the Nevada Forest was that ranchers would turn their horses out on what then was public domain that later became BLM land. When they wanted some horses, they would just go out and round them up and bring them in. Some ranchers were good ranchers, and every spring they'd go out and round up all their horses, brand and castrate the colts, and turn them back out. But other ranchers weren't that energetic, and they wouldn't round up their colts. Pretty soon you had mature studs and mares running around unbranded, and these were the animals that eventu - ally they called the mustang. The Indians in the Ely area had horses with which they'd do the same thing. In fact, it was probably more common among the Indians than among ranchers not to round up their stock and castrate and brand. For example, an Indian by the name of Adams had a Forest permit for 15 or 16 head of horses that were running on Ward Moun - tain. For a while at the end of the grazing sea - son he would faithfully round up his horses and bring them in, but finally he started getting on in years and he quit rounding them up. In the wintertime they didn't bother the Forest because they were running on BLM land, but in the summertime they were right back up on the Forest. Adams finally decided that he wasn't going to pay grazing fees; that he didn't want a grazing permit. So we told him, \"OK, get your horses off.\" He said, \"I can't. They're too wild. I disown them.\" There you had the start of another mustang band, and it built up to a fairly good size. If you let them go, mustang can overgraze or damage a considerable area, probably more so than cattle. One of the big problems with them is that they are on the range 12 months of the year, and in the spring when the snow is melting they can do a lot of trampling damage. I have seen where mustangs have left tracks six inches deep in the mud on a hillside where they were grazing. They also are graz - ing the range a long time before it is ready to graze in the spring. The grass and other plants never get a start under this kind of use, and they soon die. Mustang will trail long distances to water. They'll water, and they'll hang around water for maybe an hour or two; then they will drink again, and then they'll move out. For some distance around those water holes they clean up just about all the vegetation there is \u2014 a lot more so than cattle will do. You'd have a fairly small spring where deer would come in and drink, and maybe it was big enough that there'd be water running down out of it and a few head of cattle or sheep could come in and water. But mustangs have a bad habit when it comes to a little spring: if they can't get enough water to drink, they start pawing, and pretty soon they have that spring all tore up and so muddy...how they can ever drink that water. Mustangs can really ruin a spring. This is one of the reasons why ranchers were very much in favor of clos - ing orders. In the 12 years that I was at Ely we had to have closing orders two different times to bring the mustang population down. They were actually damaging the range\u2014they were cropping it too short, and their trails in and out to water were causing erosion. When it got too extreme we'd go to the county commis - sioners and ask for a closing order for one year. They would issue one, and during that time we could go out and shoot any horse that we found on the Forest. The closing order wouldn't go into effect for three or four months. We would notify all the livestock people, whether they ran on the For - est or not, that the order was going to go into effect on such-and-such a day, and that if they had any horses out in trespass on the Forest, to get them off. Notices were published in the paper for maybe four or five issues, and signs were put up on the road so that anybody that had a horse in trespass had adequate time to get out and round it up and bring it in. Most of them did that. HUNTING MUSTANGS The first time we hunted mustang was probably 1950, and the next time was 1955. We were just about due for another hunt when I left the district in 1959, but I doubt very much if they ever hunted mustang again, because by 1955 there was beginning to be some talk against it. The county commission - ers were kind of reluctant to give us a closing order, and when they did they pretty much told us that this would be the last one that they would issue. We had an extraordinarily severe winter in 1948-1949 that was tough on mustangs, and there were quite a lot that perished. I've seen places where mustangs had finally worked their way down into a creek bottom, where The University of Nevada Oral History Program produces and preserves primary-source oral histories that document the history and culture of Nevada and the Intermountain West.

They had eaten off all the hair on the manes and tails of each other; they'd eaten coarse food, like sagebrush or the limbs of juniper, and the sticks were so big (and maybe the mustangs were so weak that they couldn't chew adequately) that they passed through, and in the rectum the sticks had gouged the colon so bad before they died, there'd be these sticks pushing out of their rectums and you could see where blood had run onto the ground. Nobody in the Forest Service ever considered so-called mustangs to be real mustangs\u2014they were just tame horses that had gone wild. In other words, none of them have any ancestry tied to horses that the Spanish brought over. In the southern parts of the United States, maybe down in Texas, there still may be a few wild horses that have a faint trace of that Spanish blood. The mustang is an interesting animal: he's far more alert than deer or elk or just about any other wild animal, and he can see the farthest, I believe, of any four-legged animal that's out in the mountains. He also has good hearing and an excellent sense of smell, and if you're upwind from one he can smell you for a long way. And they are fast learners\u2014you don't have to shoot up a mustang herd more than once until you're going to have an awful time getting in to them again. I preferred to hunt alone, but I once got together with the Forest supervisor and two other rangers, and we set up camp at Murphy Wash [15 miles south of the Nevada border town of Baker]. The first day we had pretty good luck. After that we couldn't even get within gunshot distance of them. Hunting alone, and having your rifle with you when you were riding, you could see a band and stop and sneak up on them and get off a shot. Once in a great while you could catch them in a patch of timber or a patch of mahogany, and sit down and get set and decide to shoot them as fast as they came out of the mahogany. Then before they could get away from you, you could get two or three. The best way to locate mustang is to go around to all the springs and find where they are watering. You can tell by the tracks and their droppings just how long it's been since they've been there. Mustangs often water at night; if they've been there that night, they can't be too far off, because they only go out to where the first good feed is and they stop. So you get on your horse and you follow their tracks until maybe you came to a ridge. You stop, get off your horse, and sneak up on top of the ridge and look over; and if they're there, then you do your best to try to stalk them like you would a deer. Sometimes you can get close enough, and sometimes you can't. If you shot the stud out of a mustang band, and the mares couldn't tell where you were concealed, they would sometimes just mill around for a little bit. When you shot again they'd take off, but if you waited\u2014and sometimes you'd have to wait for half an hour or maybe an hour\u2014lots of times the mares would come back looking for the stud, and then you'd get maybe one or two more. The stud watched over the band to a certain extent, but there was always an old mare in the bunch that probably had as much to do with controlling the herd as the stud did. When you jumped a bunch, the mare would take off. She'd be the lead animal, and she was the one that deter - mined where they were going to go. The old stud would stay behind to see that everybody kept up, and if a mare lagged a little bit, he'd give her a good, big bite on the rump. Towards the last of the mustang hunting, one of the big complaints was about all this meat left out there just going to waste. To me, very little of that meat was wasted. If you shot a horse, you'd be surprised how soon ani - mals and birds like eagles, buzzards, hawks, coyotes, bobcats, skunks, weasels, badgers ... you name it\u2014how soon they could clean up a carcass. MUSTANGS HA VE A PLACE ON THE FOREST Even though mustang overpopulation on the old Nevada Forest was a recurrent problem we never tried to eliminate the herds entirely, because we felt the mustang had a place on the Forest. We just tried to reduce the population to a number the range could handle. If the Forest Service and the BLM had continued the policy that we had back in the 1950s, you'd still have plenty of mustang, but you wouldn't have all the problems that there are now. They have reached a point now where I don't think there's any solution other than an extremely tough winter.

Personally, I am most proud of the way my wife, Janet, and I have fostered our values of integrity, hard work, generosity and good humor into the developing lives of our three, now-adult children. Our marathon-running son Eric has demonstrated the courage to follow his heart by setting aside his Reno attorney career in favor of entrepre - neurially creating and managing major relay races for the running public in the West. Our equally athletic son Christopher perseveres in the challenging work of an actor, first in Los Angeles and now in New York. Our daughter, Leslie, puts her multilingual education to work helping others as a human resources executive for the national Kimpton hotel and restaurant group, based in San Francisco. Professionally, I am most proud of my part in helping develop the Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada. It is one thing to edit and publish newspapers and write books, which I have done. It is an - other, far more inspiring thing to find young talented students and guide them toward extraordinary careers in journalism. Robin and Marilee Joyce are fine examples. Brother and sister, each took my law and management classes and developed leadership careers \u2014 Marilee '85 (journalism) owning a multimedia company in Washington, D.C., and Robin '83 (journalism) '04M.A. , a media company in Las Vegas. They put their jour - nalism school lessons to work daily in their professional lives. Martha Bellisle '97 (journalism/interna - tional affairs) is another. A Reno Gazette-Jour - nal reporter, she fights for First Amendment freedoms by opposing judicial restraints in courtrooms that would limit the free flow of in - formation the public needs in our democracy. Karole Morgan-Prager '84 (journalism) took the lessons learned as a fine student in my First Amendment and Society (media law) class and went to UCLA Law School. She is a strong advocate for press freedom as the top attorney for McClatchy Company, a major American publishing organization. In 26 years of teaching, I could cite hun - dreds of extraordinary students who went on to distinguished careers. I am proud of our missions at the Reynolds School of Journalism to advocate the First Amendment freedoms serving democracy through free expression and to develop new generations of media professionals and schol - ars. The work goes on today and builds toward stronger tomorrows in the exciting age of new media ideas, content and technology. What do you most regret? I don't know if regret is the right word. I am frustrated by my inability to put learning into practice in so many new possibilities in the vastly changing world. For instance, I work in journalism around the globe but I speak only English. This means translators have to be assigned to me so that I can communicate in other countries. I think there is a widespread regret among many Americans that we have not taken the time, in schools, in our personal lives, to learn other languages that could help us better understand other cultures. I wish at least one second lan - guage, perhaps two, would be required in all American schools from first through senior high school grades. One of the problems of enthusiasts, and I am one of them, is that we so enthusiastically embrace areas of interest that in our tight focus we don't take the time to discipline ourselves into wider reaches of enthusiasms. I think we all deep down have some regret we can't be deep-sea divers and high-altitude pilots at the same time. One thing about jour - nalism is that it does let us move around and avoid that worst curse, boredom. What advice W ould you give to someone just starting out after college? That's an easy one because I work with young people every day in classrooms and in internships as they pursue their futures. My advice: Follow your heart and your head, not just one or the other. But lead with your heart. Your head will guide you. Do what makes you happy and don't just chase the dol - lar. If you do what makes you happy, you will do it well. You will evolve successfully in the opportunities you pursue, many of which will pop up as surprises in your journey. But, above all, pursue with vigor and integ - rity what makes you happy \u2014 and stay with it.

Their daughter, Rev. Jackie Leonard, has fulfilled their final bequest to the journalism school. A $3.17 million endowment will fund the Paul A. Leonard Chair in Ethics and Writing in Journalism and a gift of nearly $800,000 will fund the Paul A. and Gwen F. Leonard Memorial Scholarship Endowment. President Milton Glick praised the Leonards' support. \" All great universities build on great faculty and students. But this school, more than any other, has been built on and has benefited from the support of alumni and contributors who ensure that quality journalism will continue to have an impact in the academic curriculum and industry,\" Glick said. Paul A. Leonard was a 1936 graduate of the University of Nevada journalism program in the early days when it was still housed in the English department. After graduation, he entered his chosen profession in Elko County as a reporter and editor of the Elko Daily Free Press, and for most of the following 36 years was actively engaged in journalism in northern Nevada \u2014 first, in Elko with the Free Press ; in Ely with the Ely Daily Times ; and, finally, in Reno with the Reno Evening Gazette and the Nevada State Journal . Gwen Leonard received her degree in history from the University of Nevada in 1937. She was active in the alumni association and many community organizations and received the University's President's Medal in 1989. The Paul A. Leonard Chair in the Reynolds School of Journalism will be awarded in 2009 and provides a position for a scholar in the School of Journalism whose teaching, research, and service focus is on writing and/or ethics. The first Chair will be awarded in September 2009. \"We are honored to have earned the Leonard's support and commitment to a quality journalism school,\" said Rosemary McCarthy, academic chair for the Reynolds School of Journalism. \"The Paul A. Leonard Chair in Ethics and Writing in Journalism and the Paul A. and Gwen F. Memorial Scholarship will provide in perpetuity the ability to attract the highest caliber faculty and students that will garner national recognition for the school.\" Donor supported faculty positions \u2014 Endowed Chairs and Named Professorships \u2014 provide critical tools to attract and retain premier teachers and researchers. The endowments that support these positions forever influence the quality education provided to University of Nevada, Reno students.
