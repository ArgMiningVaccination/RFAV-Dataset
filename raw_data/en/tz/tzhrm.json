It also can help eliminate headaches in conjunction with a chiropractic adjustment, induce sleep, increase the immune system, and decrease pain. Massage Chairs Massage improves blood flow to oxygen, starved back muscles and prompts the body to release endorphin's ( the body's natural painkiller). Massage stimulates tight muscles, joints and ligaments to heal and improve range of motion, while prepping the body for the chiropractic adjustment. Massage reduces muscle spasms and cramps, by gently and gradually stretching and manipulating muscles. The end results are improved range of motion and more effective chiropractic adjustment which leads to a faster recovery. Moist Heat Moist heat allows for a increase in blood circulation and deeper penetration than dry heat, which allows for greater muscle relaxation. Heat is always used approximately 48 hours after a injury. Immediately after a injury and up to 48 hours, ice is recommended. Electrical Muscle Stimulation: Electrical stimulation can be used for pain relief. One theory is that the stimulation causes the brain to release the body's natural painkillers, endorphin's and enkephalin's, resulting in pain relief. Studies have shown marked increases in these chemicals after the use of low-frequency electrical muscle stimulation. The use of EMS is used to help before the chiropractic adjustment allows for more comfortable effective adjustments. Ultrasound Therapy Ultrasound has many different effects, including a deep heating effect. This is a favorite of Dr. Wrights with motor vehicle accident injuries and will be applied before a chiropractic adjustment. It has been shown to cause increases in tissue relaxation, increased local blood flow, and scar tissue breakdown. A increase in blood flow of a injured site can help reduce local swelling and chronic inflammation, and can help promote bone fracture healing. An increase in power density of ultrasound will greatly increase the scar tissue breakdown, meaning if the ultrasound head is not getting hot, then its not getting the job done. This heating effect in combination with the movement of the ultrasound head on the injured site is very therapeutic and relaxing for the patient. All in all, the main goal is to loosen the connective tissue and muscles in order to get a more effective longer lasting chiropractic adjustment. "}
