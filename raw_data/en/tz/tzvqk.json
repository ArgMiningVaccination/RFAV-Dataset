The legislature further declares where it is a duty of the state to assure a healthy environment and minimum standards of quality in health care facilities and among health care professionals, the ultimate responsibility for a healthy society lies with the citizens themselves. For these reasons, the legislature recognizes the need for a strong, clear focus on health issues in state government and among state health agencies to give expression to the needs of individual citizens and local communities as they seek to preserve the public health. It is the intent of the legislature to form such focus by creating a single department in state government with the primary responsibilities for the preservation of public health, monitoring health care costs, the maintenance of minimal standards for quality in health care delivery, and the general oversight and planning for all the state's activities as they relate to the health of its citizenry. Further, it is the intent of the legislature to improve illness and injury prevention and health promotion, and restore the confidence of the citizenry in the expenditure of public funds on health activities, and to ensure that this new health agency delivers quality health services in an efficient, effective, and economical manner that is faithful and responsive to policies established by the legislature.

Therefore, the legislature intends that charity care requirements and related enforcement provisions for hospitals be explicitly established.

It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to require hospitals to provide, and report to the state, charity care to persons with acute care needs, and to have a state agency both monitor and report on the relative commitment of hospitals to the delivery of charity care services, as well as the relative commitment of public and private purchasers or payers to charity care funding.

PART VII RURAL HEALTH !af98,700 NEW SECTION. Sec. 172. (1) The legislature declares that availability of health services to rural citizens is an issue on which a state policy is needed. The legislature finds that changes in the demand for health care, in reimbursement polices of public and private purchasers, in the economic and demographic conditions in rural areas threaten the availability of care services. In addition, many factors inhibit needed changes in the delivery of health care services to rural areas which include inappropriate and outdated regulatory laws, aging and inefficient health care facilities, the absence of local planning and coordination of rural health care services, the lack of community understanding of the real costs and benefits of supporting rural hospitals, the lack of regional systems to assure access to care that cannot be provided in every community, and the absence of state health care policy objectives. The legislature further finds that the creation of effective health care delivery systems that assure access to health care services provided in an affordable manner will depend on active local community involvement. It further finds that it is the duty of the state to create a regulatory environment and health care payment policy that promotes innovation at the local level to provide such care. It further declares that it is the responsibility of the state to develop policy that provides direction to local communities with regard to such factors as a definition of health care services, identification of state-wide health status outcomes, clarification of state, regional, community responsibilities and interrelationships for assuring access to affordable health care and continued assurances that quality health care services are provided. (2) The legislature further finds that many rural communities do not operate hospitals in a cost-efficient manner. The cost of operating the rural hospital often exceeds the revenues generated. Some of these hospitals face closure, which may result in the loss of health care services for the community. Many communities are struggling to retain health care services by operating a cost-efficient facility located in the community. Current regulatory laws do not provide for the facilities licensure option that is appropriate for rural areas. A major barrier to the development of an appropriate rural licensure model is federal medicare approval to guarantee reimbursement for the costs of providing care and operating the facility. Medicare certification typically elaborates upon state licensure requirements. Medicare approval of reimbursement is more likely if the state has developed legal criteria for a rural-appropriate health facility. Medicare has begun negotiations with other states facing similar problems to develop exceptions with the goal of allowing reimbursement of rural alternative health care facilities. It is in the best interests of rural citizens for Washington state to begin negotiations with the federal government with the objective of designing a medicare eligible rural health care facility structured to meet the health care needs of rural Washington and be eligible for federal and state financial support for its development and operation. NEW SECTION. Sec. 173. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.

(5) \"Health care system strategic plan\" means a plan developed by the participant and includes identification of health care service needs of the participant, services and personnel necessary to meet health care service needs, identification of health status outcomes and outcome measures, identification of funding sources, and strategies to meet health care needs including measures of effectiveness. (6) \"Institutions of higher education\" means educational institutions as defined in RCW 28B.10.016. (7) \"Local administrator\" means an individual or organization representing the participant who may enter into legal agreements on behalf of the participant.

The services to be provided by the rural health care facility may be delivered in a single location or may be geographically dispersed in the community health service catchment area so long as they are organized under a common administrative structure or through a mechanism that provides appropriate referral, treatment, and follow-up. (12) \"Secretary\" means the secretary of health. NEW SECTION. Sec. 174. (1) The department shall establish the Washington rural health system project to provide financial and technical assistance to participants.

Individuals appointed to any technical advisory committee shall serve without compensation for their services as members, but may be reimbursed for their travel expenses pursuant to RCW 43.03.050 and 43.03.060. (4) The secretary may contract with third parties for services necessary to carry out activities to implement this chapter where this will promote economy, avoid duplication of effort, and make the best use of available expertise. (5) The secretary may apply for, receive, and accept gifts and other payments, including property and service, from any governmental or other public or private entity or person, and may make arrangements as to the use of these receipts, including the undertaking of special studies and other projects related to the delivery of health care in rural areas.

(2) In providing a list of qualified consultants the secretary and the state shall not be held responsible for assuring qualifications of consultants and shall be held harmless for the actions of consultants. Furthermore, the secretary and the state shall not be held liable for the failure of participants to meet contractual obligations established in connection with project participation. NEW SECTION. Sec. 181. (1) The department shall establish and adopt such standards and regulations pertaining to the construction, maintenance, and operation of a rural health care facility and the scope of health care services, and rescind, amend, or modify such regulations from time to time as necessary in the public interest. In developing the regulations, the department shall consult with representatives of rural hospitals, community mental health centers, public health departments, community and migrant health clinics, and other providers of health care in rural communities. The department shall also consult with third-party payers, consumers, local officials, and others to insure broad participation in defining regulatory standards and requirements that are appropriate for a rural health care facility. (2) When developing the rural health care facility licensure rules, the department shall consider the report of the Washington rural health care commission established under chapter 207, Laws of 1988.

NEW SECTION. Sec. 183. The rural health care facility is not considered a hospital for building occupancy purposes. NEW SECTION. Sec. 184. (1) The legislature finds that a current shortage of nurses exists in many areas of the state as well as in certain nurse specialties. Surveys of nurses in Washington state evidenced a need for more accessible education for advancement to higher levels of practice. The legislature declares that there is a need for the development of a state-wide plan for nursing education to meet the educational needs of nurses and the health care needs of the citizens of Washington state. (2) The higher education coordinating board, in consultation with at least the state board of nursing, the state board of practical nursing, representatives of the state board for community college education, the superintendent of public instruction, public and private nursing education, health care facilities, and practicing nurses, shall develop a state-wide plan to be implemented no later than January 1, 1992.

The higher education coordinating board shall submit a plan to the legislature by December 1, 1990. The board shall make a progress report to the senate and house of representatives standing committees on health care by December 1, 1989. NEW SECTION. Sec. 185. (1) The legislature finds that a shortage of physicians, nurses, and physician assistants exists in rural areas of the state. In addition, many education programs to train these health care providers do not include options for practical training experience in rural settings. As a result, many health care providers find their current training does not prepare them for the unique demands of rural practice. The legislature declares that the availability of rural training opportunities as a part of professional medical, nursing, and physician assistant education would provide needed practical experience, serve to attract providers to rural areas, and help address the current shortage of these providers in rural Washington. (2) The higher education coordinating board, in consultation with at least the state board for community college education, the superintendent of public instruction, and state-supported education programs in medicine and nursing, shall develop a plan for increasing rural training opportunities for students in medicine and nursing. The plan shall provide for direct exposure to rural health professional practice conditions for students planning careers in rural medicine and nursing. (3) The boards and the medical and nurse education programs shall: (a) Inventory existing rural-based clinical experience programs, including internships, clerkships, residencies, and other training opportunities available to students pursuing degrees in nursing and medicine; (b) Identify where training opportunities do not currently exist and are needed; (c) Develop recommendations for improving the availability of rural training opportunities; (d) Develop recommendations on establishing agreements between education programs to assure that all students in medical and nurse education programs in the state have access to rural training opportunities; and (e) Review private and public funding sources to finance rural-based training opportunities. (4) The higher education coordinating board shall report to the house of representatives and senate standing committees on health care by December 1, 1989, with their findings and recommendations including needed legislative changes. NEW SECTION. Sec. 186. (1) The legislature finds that a shortage of trained radiologic technologists, respiratory therapists, and pharmacy and laboratory technologists exists in rural areas of the state. In addition, low patient volumes in rural hospitals and primary care clinics make it financially difficult to hire and retain separate individuals with skills from each of these professions. The result is that health care services that could be provided locally are often not provided and patients are forced to go to urban areas for care. The legislature declares that some limited cross- credentialing of health professionals with skills from one or more of these professions would be desirable in rural areas where shortages exist. The legislature further declares that the cross-credentialing of health professionals should not result in a reduction in the quality of health care provided by such individuals. (2) The department of health, in consultation with the board of health, the higher education coordinating board, representatives of rural hospitals and rural primary health care clinics, and other entities that the department of health wishes to consult with, shall investigate opportunities for the development of a pool of individuals who are cross-trained with skills in radiology, respiratory therapy, and pharmacy and laboratory technology. (3) The department shall: (a) Determine whether there is a need for health care professionals with multiple skills in rural areas; (b) Determine whether individuals can be cross-credentialed for multiple skills without a reduction in the quality of health care; (c) Examine current training, education and state credentialing requirements for each of the affected professions; (d) Identify what training and educational requirements are needed to allow for the medical practice of individuals with multiple skills; (e) Develop recommendations on changes in current credentialing requirements to allow for credentialing of individuals with multiple skills; and (f) Develop recommendations on whether the practice of cross-credentialed individuals should be limited to rural areas of the state. (4) The department shall report to the house of representatives committee on health care and the senate committee on health care and corrections by December 1, 1990, on the need for changes in current credentialing requirements for the affected professions. (5) The sum of forty-five thousand four hundred ninety-three dollars, or as much thereof as may be necessary, is appropriated from the health professions account to the department of health for the biennium ending June 30, 1991, to carry out the purposes of this section. NEW SECTION. Sec. 187. The legislature finds that changes in demographics, the delivery of health care services, and an escalation in the cost of educating health professionals has resulted in shortages of health professionals. A poor distribution of health care professionals has resulted in a surplus of some professionals in some areas of the state and a shortage of others in other parts of the state such as in the more rural areas. The high cost of health professional education requires that health care practitioners command higher incomes to repay the financial obligations incurred to obtain the required training. Health professional shortage areas are often areas that have troubled economies and lower per capita incomes. These areas often require more services because the health care needs are greater due to poverty or because the areas are difficult to service due to geographic circumstances. The salary potentials for shortage areas are often not as favorable when compared to nonshortage areas and practitioners are unable to serve. The legislature further finds that encouraging health professionals to serve in shortage areas is essential to assure continued access to health care for persons living in these parts of the state. NEW SECTION. Sec. 188. Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter. (1) \"Loan repayment\" means a loan that is paid in full or in part if the participant renders health care services in a health professional shortage area or medically underserved areas as defined by the department of health.

(3) \"Board\" means the higher education coordinating board. (4) \"Health professional shortage areas\" means those geographic areas where health professionals are in short supply as a result of geographic maldistribution and where vacancies exist in serious numbers that jeopardize patient care and pose a threat to the public health and safety.

(6) \"Licensed health professional\" means a person authorized in the state of Washington to practice medicine pursuant to chapter 18.57 or 18.57A RCW or 18.71 or 18.71A RCW, nursing pursuant to chapter 18.88 or 18.78 RCW, or to practice dentistry pursuant to chapter 18.32 RCW.

(2) In providing health care services the participant shall not discriminate against any person on the basis of the person's ability to pay for such services or because payment for the health care services provided to such persons will be made under the insurance program established under part A or B of Title XVIII of the federal social security act or under a state plan for medical assistance approved under Title XIX of the federal social security act and agrees to accept assignment under section 18.42(b)(3)(B)(ii) of such act for all services for which payment may be made under part B of Title XVIII and enters into an appropriate agreement with the department of social and health services for medical assistance under Title XIX to provide services to individuals entitled to medical assistance under the plan.

(7) Except for circumstances beyond their control, participants who serve less than three years shall be obligated to repay to the program an amount equal to twice the total amount paid by the program on their behalf in addition to any payments on the unsatisfied portion of the principal and interest. The board shall determine the applicability of this subsection. (8) The board is responsible for the collection of payments made on behalf of participants from the participants who discontinue service before their three-year obligation. The board shall exercise due diligence in such collection, maintaining all necessary records to ensure that the maximum amount of payment made on behalf of the participant is recovered. Collection under this section shall be pursued using the full extent of the law, including wage garnishment if necessary. (9) The board shall not be held responsible for any outstanding payments on principal and interest to any lenders once a participant's eligibility expires. NEW SECTION. Sec. 193.

Whenever a recipient shall cease to use such property for residential purposes, either for himself or his dependents, the property shall be considered as a resource which can be made available to meet need, and if the recipient or his dependents absent themselves from the home for a period of ninety consecutive days such absence, unless due to hospitalization or health reasons or a natural disaster, shall raise a rebuttable presumption of abandonment: PROVIDED, That if in the opinion of three physicians the recipient will be unable to return to the home during his lifetime, and the home is not occupied by a spouse or dependent children or disabled sons or daughters, such property shall be considered as a resource which can be made available to meet need.

The department may permit the above exemption of earnings of a child to be retained by such child to cover the cost of special future identifiable needs even though the total exceeds the exemptions or resources granted to applicants and recipients of public assistance, but consistent with federal requirements. In formulating rules and regulations pursuant to this chapter, the department shall define income and resources and the availability thereof, consistent with federal requirements.
