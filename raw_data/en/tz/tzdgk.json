Stimulant laxatives can decrease potassium levels in the body. Low potassium levels can increase the risk of side effects from digoxin. Medications changed by the liver (Cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) substrates) interacts with FO-TI Some medications are changed and broken down by the liver. Fo-ti might change how quickly the liver breaks down these medications. This could change the effects and side effects of these medications.
