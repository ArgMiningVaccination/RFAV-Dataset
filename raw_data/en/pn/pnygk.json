COURSE OVERVIEW COURSE TITLE: Media and Entertainment - Animator An Animator is an artist who creates multiple images, which when displayed in rapid sequence give an illusion of movement called animation. An Animator needs to refer to the concept of artwork prepared by animation artists to produce a sequence of 2D or 3D images by producing multiple images called frames, which when sequenced together rapidly create an illusion of movement.
