The Bamford Action Plan (2009-2011) is driving much- needed change in how we care for people affected by mental health or intellectual disabilities. One in six of our population has a mental health need at any one time, and it is estimated that between 1-2% of our population, that is around 24, 000 people, have an intellectual disability. In addition, there are many others who have or will develop dementia in the future. Our highly committed staff who deliver health and social care services have expertise and skills that must be supported by the best up-to-date knowledge. Through research, new knowledge is created. But it is now recognised that, for a variety of reasons, essential knowledge does not always reach the people who most need to use it. The knowledge can vary from better understanding of the causes of poor mental health or intellec tual disabilities th rough to evidence on which services bring about the greatest improvements to the lives of people or their carers. To bring together this knowledge we have commissioned five Research Reviews. Each Review was written by a team of experts in academia, clinical services and care who have collected the most up-to-date evidence from research done locally or globally. All of the review teams were based in Northern Ireland so we know that the Reviews are relevant to our local situation. The quality of each Review has also been assured through input from experts who are based in other parts of the UK or internationally. The priority areas addressed by the Reviews are: Children & Young People including early interventions, the needs of looked-after children and the development of resilience; Patient Outcomes including the measurement of recovery and the capture of patient feedback; Intellectual Disability including th e management of challenging behaviours; Psychological Therapies including how to embed these in services for children and adults across the lifespan and including those with intellectual disability and severe mental health problems; Primary Care including aspects important to the prevention, recognition and management of mental health in the community. As well as providing accessible knowledge and information, each Review has highlighted gaps in our knowledge. We will commission new res earch projects aiming to fill those gaps. 4My final acknowledgement is of contributions made by local people, patients and their carers who assisted in the selection of the priority areas covered by the Reviews and provided extremely helpful feedback to the review teams. Some of those people also serve through their membership of our Bamford Monitoring Group. I dedicate these Reviews to the people who are affected by mental health or intellectual disabilities. I urge our health and social car e staff, education professionals, members of voluntary organisations and others to use these Reviews so that all members of our community may receive the best possible support to live their lives with dignity.

It presents a series of overviews of effectiveness research relevant to the mental health of children and young people in Northern Ireland. This review covers the subgroups identified as priority areas of research by the PHA following consultation with policy makers, practitioners and commissioners, namely: Early Interventions; Mental Health of Looked After Children; and Development of Resilience. The review also covers two additional areas of importance highlighted by the Bamford report, namely: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders and Complex Needs; and Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth. The overall purpose of this report is to map the cu rrent evidence base in relation to 'what works' in each of the five identified areas, by considering the availa ble literature, identifying policy implications, examining specific subthemes, and id entifying the key research questions requiring attention in future research. This executive summary highlights some of the substantive findings emerging from the review, but focuses primarily on implications for research. Chapter 2 - Review methodology It was agreed that the most effective way in which to conduct this report was to provide a systematic overview of systematic reviews in each of the identified priority areas. The review was conducted to an agr eed protocol which set out, a priori, the eligibility/inclusion criteria, search strategy, and the approach to data management and critical appraisal. To be eligible for this review, reviews had to ad dress at least one of the research questions of interest and have systematically searched a minimum of two electronic databases. Each specific research question had an individual search strate gy designed for its purpose (see Appendix 1) to be entered into an agreed list of databases and websites. Results were restricted to reviews published during or after 2005, and in English only. Reviews from low- and middle-income countries were also excluded. Disagreement among review authors was resolved by retrieving the full paper and/or discussion in one of the regular team meetings. Data was extracted from the included reviews using a standard data extraction form. The quality of each included review was appraised through use of the AMSTAR Qua lity Assessment Tool (Shea et al., 2009). 8Stakeholders from within the area of Child and Adolescent Mental Health were identified and consulted with, both at the outset of the review pr ocess, and towards the concluding stages. This was to ensure that priority areas had been identified, and that the resulting review was of maximum relevance to Northern Ireland. SECTION B - CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS Chapter 3 - The mental health of children and young people in Northern Ireland The evidence suggests that the Troubles may have contributed to poor mental health within Northern Ireland, both through their impact on the social and economic circumstances of individuals and neighbourhoods, and more directly via trauma, bereavement and violence. This may limit the generalizability of existing prevalence studies of child and adolescent mental health conducted in Great Britain, neither of which included Northern Ireland. Key findings include: A prevalence study specific to Northern Ireland should be commissioned; The methodology of a Northern Ireland study should be designed so that it supports international comparisons. SECTION C - EARLY INTERVENTIONS Chapter 4 - Recognising and facilitating help-seeking behaviour This chapter reviews the evidence relating to what works in helping professionals and lay workers to foster and to recognise help seeking behaviour from young people and their parents. Just four reviews were deemed eligible for inclusion. Key findings include: More is known about the barriers to help se eking that what facilitates it. Stigma and embarrassment, worries about confidentialit y and the response they might receive, are amongst the barriers known to deter many young people; There is a need for the development and rigorous evaluation of initiatives designed to encourage help-seeking behaviour. Considering the particular problem of youth suicide in Northern Ireland, this is a high priority area for research; Mental health literacy programmes, though pote ntially effective, are thin on the ground and poorly evaluated. Chapter 5 - Interventions to prevent the factors that contribute to poor mental health and self- harm In considering the question of what we know about how best to intervene to prevent the factors that contribute to poor mental health and self-harm, we identified nineteen reviews that met our eligibility criteria. Interventio ns that have been evaluated focus primarily on reducing or preventing bullying, alcohol and substance misuse, poor social skills and low self-esteem, bereavement and exposure to traumatic events or war and conflict. Key findings include: 9 Many anti-bullying programmes are school based. Reviews provide somewhat conflicting evidence, which may be attributable to differences in inclusion criteria etc. There is some evidence that whole-school programmes are more effective than curriculum based programmes; School-based interventions designed to enhance skills have been found significantly to reduce drug use and improve decision-making skills and self-esteem, compared to other school- based programmes. Behavioural and cognit ive-behavioural interventions generally outperform others, but overall the evidence base needs to be stronger. One review suggested that parenting programmes can be effective in preventing substance abuse. Evidence from three reviews indicate that cognitive-behavioural therapies appear significantly to reduce the psychological harm among symptomatic children and adolescents affected by one or more traumatic events, but that school-based group interventions are not sufficient for reducing distress in children ex posed to the traumas of war. Evidence of the effectiveness of bereavement interventions is lacking. Improved reporting of the studies is recommended, including detailing the exact implementation of interventions and full description of participant's characteristics; Long-term follow-up, costs-benefit analyses, and participants views are also absent from the literature and strongly required. Chapter 6 - Interventions to prevent attachment and other behavioural disorders We identified six reviews that dealt with this aspect of mental health, most of which were concerned with either school-based or parenting programmes. Key findings include: There is evidence that 'whole-school' progra mmes promoting social and emotional health are more effective than brief, class based programmes aimed at preventing mental health problems. However, longer term, more rigorous research of school-based interventions is needed to assess the impact of whole-school and targeted approaches in the UK; The effectiveness of home visiting programmes comes from studies with persuasive findings, but with some question marks as to their applic ability to the UK context. Evaluations of the Nurse Family Partnership are currently under way in the UK; There is a strong evidence base for the effectiveness of parent training programmes, but these require further research to determ ine their long-term effectiveness. Chapter 7 - Interventions addressing the support needs of carers The final area of early intervention research ex amined was that relating to interventions for supporting parents and other carers. Ten reviews were deemed eligible for inclusion. Key findings include: Parenting programmes are available that target the needs of parents, including learning disabled parents and parents with mental health problems. Some programmes, such as Incredible Years and Triple P, have demonstrated an ability to improve parenting, and outcomes for both parents and children, in the short and medium term. More generally, rigorous evaluations and long term follow up are rare. 10 Programmes targeting learning disabled parents, parents with mental health problems, whose children have mental health problems are fewer in number and less well evaluated. The same is true of interventions for substitute carers and fathers. Research must address which interventions are best suited to different groups of people, including parents with learning disabilities, parents of children with mental health problems, foster carers, and fathers. SECTION D - MALTREATED AND LOOKED AFTER CHILDREN Chapter 8 - Models of service that provide timel y and effective help to children looked after Only three reviews relevant to this important to pic were judged eligible. These suggested that: Kinship care is a potentially effective strategy, but requires further exploration in higher quality studies of longitudinal designs; Treatment Foster Care was identified as a potentially effective intervention, but one that requires more in-depth evaluation, with more diverse locations and populations. In relation to the research agenda, there is a need for: longitudinal designs to investigate the outcomes for children of kinship care and other out-of- home placements; the development of psychometrically sound instruments of family and child functioning to enable more reliable comparisons between groups; to identify and control for the forms of bias commonly associated with studies of out-of-home care e.g. selection bias, and to replicate studies in a variety of socio-demographic and policy contexts. Chapter 9 - Interventions for children traumatised through maltreatment and disrupted relationships with their primary carers Ten eligible reviews were identified that examined the evidence for what interventions were most likely to address the consequences of maltreatment and/or disrupted relationships with primary carers. Key findings include: Most attention has been directed at the ou tcomes following child sexual abuse, leaving physical abuse and neglect relati vely ignored areas of research; Children who have experienced sexual abuse and who are symptomatic i.e. have one or more of the difficulties commonly associated with sexual abuse appear to benefit from receiving therapy, and the weight of evidence favours cognitive-behavioural therapy. Both individual and group-based approaches can be useful. More generally, there is a need for studies that: use more robust, experimental designs; that provide better baseline information, including the co-occurrence of other types of abuse (in order to enable conclusions to be drawn about the differential effectiveness of interventions 11for specific forms of maltreatment); that are better reported, and use a multidimensional approach to the assessment of outcomes. Other research gaps include the prevention of maltreatment in high risk populations and promoting parental sensitivity and infant-parent attachment. Chapter 10 - Effective approaches to multidisciplinary and multi-agency working The final issue covered in Section D focused on effective approaches of multidisciplinary and multi-agency work. The dearth of evidence available in this area is reflected in the fact that only one review was deemed eligible for inclusion. Key findings for the research agenda are: There is little further need for studies of th e barriers and facilitators to multi-agency and multi-disciplinary working. More is required on the relative effectiveness of the different interv entions designed to promote multi-agency and multi-disciplinary practice. The end point of delivery, and difference made to the children's lives, must be a key consideration in such research. Controlled before and after, and interrupted time series designs, should be considered as potential opportunities for rigorous evaluation. SECTION E - THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENCE Chapter 11 - Promoting and nurturing the development of resilience Six reviews were identified that met the inclusion criteria. None of the included studies focus solely on the development of resilience, but rather on interventions targeting adverse events (including depression, anxiety, and maltreatment), only some of which incorporate the development of resilience. Five of the six reviews were concerned with addressing depression, and anxiety in young people, with only one addressing treatment following child neglect or maltreatment. Key findings include: The Penn Resiliency programme, based on cogni tive-behavioural theories of depression, features prominently across the results of the reviews as a promising intervention. It aims to assist participants to adapt positively to adverse events (and prevent depression); The prominence of one programme could be considered an indicator of the relative lack of other programmes available. This programme should be trialled in other policy contexts by independent trialists; Variability in reported effect sizes has been at tributed to variability in the conduct of the programmes, therefore future research should explore which aspects of the programme are most supportive to the programme; Interventions with a more expl icit focus on nurturing resilience are needed, but may not be possible without a better understanding of the nature of resilience. 12 One possible area of research might be that of assessing the impact of using peers for resilience training. Chapter 12 - Interventions to address the mental health needs of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered young people Only 2 reviews were judged eligible for inclusion. Key findings include: A significant gap in research was immediately apparent in this area, particularly regarding those diagnosed with gender identity disorder; The limited research that does exist in the area requires further attention to areas including coping with minority stress, and addr essing the diversity of participants. There is a need to improve the methodological quality of studies in this area. For example, researchers should try to move beyond convenience samples, and to incorporate more prospective longitudinal work. Chapter 13 -Preventing self-harm and suicide Twenty four reviews were deemed eligible for inclusion. Key findings include: The complexity of the issues involved suggest that a 'one size fits all' approach to preventing suicide or self-harm is unlikely to be feasible; The priorities for this area should include the development of conceptu ally and empirically sound interventions evaluated through larger trials; Additional priorities for this area include studi es examining the socio- economic gradient and the wider structural barriers to mental health, studies of the effectiveness of help lines, and greater focus on high risk groups, impact of self-harm and suicide awareness training. Chapter 14 - Helping parents with mental health problems Eleven reviews were identified that assessed the evidence relating to interventions designed to help parents with mental health problems to be good enough parents. Key findings include: There is an evident need for a prevalence study of parental mental health problems in Northern Ireland; Potential tools must be piloted and their effect iveness evaluated, subjecting new initiatives to evaluation studies from their outset; An ignored but essential area to address may be the experiences and needs of fathers with mental health problems. Chapter 15 - Interventions aimed at supporting the children of parents with mental health problems. Four reviews were included in this chapter, though only one met the inclusion criteria. Key findings include: 13 There are a number of barriers to effective practice by mental health workers, including lack of policy and practice guidelines; inadequate reso urce allocation; lack of clarity around role boundaries, and concern about undermining their relationship with a patient by raising issues regarding their parenting; Interventions that combine work with the pare nt with direct support for the child are well received. The quality of the relationships between professionals and the families they supported appears to be an essential lever for change across a range of services, such as the Family Nurse Partnership and Home-Start. There is some evidence on the effectiveness of early interventions, yet interventions targeting older children remain relatively ignored. The mechanisms involved in the associations between parental mental health and children's safety, health and well-being need also to be better understood. As the vast majority of research focuses on pa rental depression involving the mother, further attention should be paid to effects on children of depressed fathers. SECTION F - THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THOSE WITH COMPLEX NEEDS / AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS Chapter 16 - Effective interventions for assertiv e outreach/intensive treatment/day unit treatment for young people with complex needs In this area, only one review was deemed eligible for inclusion. Key find ings from this single review are: There is a need for well-designed, adequately powered RCTs examining which services result in the best outcomes, although the ethical limitations of such studies are acknowledged; There is a need for in-depth qualitative research exploring the experience of service users, parents and professionals. Chapter 17 - Improving the social and communicat ion skills of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders Twenty three reviews were deemed eligible for inclusion. Key findings include: The social and communication skills of children and young people with ASD can be enhanced by social interventions, but it is not possible to draw conclusions about the superiority of one intervention over another. Future research should not merely determine whether a treatment is effective, but it must also specify clearly for whom and in what context the intervention is effective; Future research should also include direct comparisons of various types of interventions, in addition to using placebo or no treatment as comparators, in order to provide evidence that will assist patients and practitioners in choosing among many treatment options. 14 Increased use of experimental group designs would be of particular use; It would also be of considerable benefit to conduct direct comparisons of one intervention against another, to aid in choosing among the different options; It is important to explore application of interventions to older children and adolescents over 5 years of age. SECTION G - OVERALL SUMMARY Chapter 18 - Improving the social The breadth and quality of the included reviews in each of the topics varied greatly. There are some issues that appeared particularly co mmon across many of the chapters including: The need to improve the methodological quality of many of the studies involved; The question over how applicable many findings are to a Northern Ireland context specifically; and The need for a greater use of more diverse populations in studies of intervention effectiveness. While some promising work has been highlighted by the results of many of the searches, each of the topics under investigation are equally deserving of more attention and investigation. Geraldine Macdonald Nuala Livingstone Gavin Davidson Seaneen * 16 17CHAPTER 1 Background and Scope of the Review Background This report is one of five Rapid Reviews commissioned by the Public Health Agency (PHA) in Northern Ireland. The Health and Social Care Research and Development Division of the PHA identified each review as a priority area following consultation with researchers and users of research (policy makers, practitioners and commissioners; patients, clients and carers). The purpose of the reviews is to inform calls for primary research, by considering the available literature, identifying policy implications, exam ining specified subthemes, and identifying key research questions. The reviews were expected also to provide 'immediate outputs for use by policy makers, practitioners and commissioners' (HPA 2010). This review focuses on the mental health of children and young people in Northern Ireland. The other four reviews cover: learning disabilities; patient outcomes; primary care; and psychological therapies. We have sought to minimise duplication of effort in the scope of this review, though some overlap may be inevitable given the timesca le for completion and the absence of detailed information on other reviews being undertaken. Scope of the review This review covers the subgroups specified in the commissioning brief, namely: Early interventions, including the recogni tion of help seeking behaviours; Mental health of looked after children, and The development of resilience among young people, including those who self harm. It also covers two additional issues highlighted in the Bamford Report: Children with autistic spect rum disorders (ASD), and Gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth. The review sought to map the evidence base relati ng to 'what works' in each of these five areas, at primary, secondary and tertiary level. Each of these areas was further specified at the proposal stage, and agreed after consultation with a group of stakeholders. The scope of the report was determined as follows. Paragraph numbers refer to the relevant sections of the 2006 Bamford report, unless otherwise stated. The review also set out to address two more general questions: What is known about the mental health issues of children in NI?, and Does NI need a prevalence survey child and adolescent mental health? Early interventions The Bamford Report recognised that use was being made of evidence-based programmes, such as Incredible Years , but recommended a broad review of the available evidence on early interventions with reference to NI policy and service context (para 5.13). This review covers the following areas of early intervention: What helps professionals and lay workers to identify help seeking behaviours (from parents, children and others)? 18 What interventions best address factors known to contribute to poor mental health and self- harm, such as bullying (para 5. 17-20)? What primary and secondary prevention strategies/interventions are most likely to help prevent attachment and other behavioural difficulties amongst children and young people (Bamford 2007, para 5.13)? Mental health of maltreate d and looked after children In relation to maltreated and looked after children, the Bamford review identified the following questions, which provide the structure for this section of the review: How can a coherent service response best be developed that does not rely on the presence of symptoms as a basis of referral (e.g. proactive and comprehensive approaches to the assessment of the physical, educational and mental health needs of LAC) (para 5.21)? What interventions are most likely to provide effective support to children traumatised through maltreatment or disrupted relationships with their primary carers? (para 5.17-20) What models of services are most likely to ensure that children looked after receive timely and effective help? What approaches to multi-disciplinary and multi-agency work are most effective? The development of resilience, including those who self harm Here we focused on the following questions: What interventions best promote/nurture the development of resilience? ( Bamford notes the importance of pursuing infant mental health and early interventions services as a preventative strategy (para 5.12)). What interventions/strategies are most likely to help address the mental health issues relevant to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered young people (paras 5.6 and 5.7)? What interventions show most promise / evidence of effectiveness in preventing self-harm and suicide? What interventions are best placed to help pare nts with mental ill health provide good enough parenting to their children (para 5.22)? How can services support their parenting whilst remaining mindful of the needs of children and young people themselves? Mental health and wellbeing of those with complex needs/Autistic Spectrum Disorders Here we focused on: What are the most effective approaches for assertive outreach/intensive treatment/ day unit treatment for young people with complex needs? How can we improve the social and communication skills/enhance social inclusion of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (para 5.23)? 19CHAPTER 2 Review methodology The breadth of this priority area, the constrained timescale, and our knowledge of the field indicated that the most cost-effective and useful approach to this rapid review would be systematically to search for, critically appraise, and draw conclusions from existing reviews. In order to ensure relevance to Northern Ireland, we sought advice and information from a range of stakeholders, some of whom submitted written information and some of whom provided advice on the review at the outset and at the drafting stage. There is no agreed methodology for rapid reviews, either in relation to process or validity (Watt et al. 2008; Ganaan et al. 2010), but there is consensus that transparency and explicitness are key, along with care in interpreting and using the evidence. This section summarises our approach as per the protocol submitted to the HPA. Changes made from the protocol originally proposed are set out below. One related to the search strategy and the other to the selection of reviews. Eligibility criteria Reviews that address at least one of the questions identified above (page 2-3) were included. No design criteria were imposed in relation to the study designs included in a systematic review. A minimal threshold was used for identifying systematic reviews, namely that the authors had systematically searched at least two electronic databases. Search strategy For each specific question, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic search strategy of databases and websites, including: the Cochrane Library, Campbell Library, DARE, Clinical Evidence, MEDLINE, ES RC Websites, National Guidelines Clearing House, SIGLE, Sociological Abstracts, Psychological Abstracts, and Social Science Citation Index. Unusually for a systematic review, we restricted our inclusion criteria to reviews published during or after 2005, and in English only. We also excluded reviews from low- and middle-income countries. We used a very low threshold for inclusion, namely that reviews should have systematically searched at least two databases. Search strategies are provided in Appendix1. Whilst the search strategy adopted entailed some duplication of effort, it was considered to be the most efficient approach given the timescale. We took the decision to limit the searches to 2005 and beyond after piloting one or two of the searches, because of the volume of citations involved. Although we did not search for reviews that were not systematic reviews (minimally defined), we noted non-systematic reviews, when identified, with the intention of drawing on these in areas where we found no systematic reviews. All citations were downloaded to REFWORKS, as this was the only software common to all review authors. The reference lists of included reviews were carefully scrutinised for other eligible reviews. One author (NL) oversaw the quality of the search strategies and undertook some independent checks on the work of other colleagues on the author team. 20Data management Disagreements were resolved by discussion and/or by retrieving the full paper where necessary. The processes of review, study selection and exclusion were carefully documented. One person reviewed the results of those questions for which he or she held the primary responsibility, in consultation with a second for those reviews where there was any uncertainty. Uncertainty about a paper's eligibility was reso lved by obtaining the full paper. If some uncertainty remained, this was discussed with another team member and or in regular team meetings (n=9 during the 12 week process). One person conducted data extraction for each included review, with ar ound 10% random quality checks by Macdonald or Livingst one. Data were recorded in a se ries of tables relevant to particular interventions/issues/questions. For each included review, the data extracted covered: location/setting, date of publication, sample char acteristics, intervention ch aracteristics (including theoretical underpinning or services, delivery, duration, outcomes and within-intervention variability), comparisons (if relevant), outcomes, information on process, and implementation. Critical Appraisal of the evidence Two people independently assessed the quality of each included review and the reliability/validity of its conclusions. Quality appraisal of intervention reviews was assessed using AMSTAR (Shea et al. 2009). Preliminary evidence suggested that AMSTAR has good agreement, reliability, construct validity and feasibility. It was felt that AMSTAR adequately captured the features of quality set out by the HDA Evidence Base (Swann et al. 2005), namely transparency, 'systematicity' and quality, so thes e were not separately scored as originally proposed. AMSTAR comprises eleven components relevant to the quality of systematic reviews. For each component a review is judged 'Yes', 'No', 'Can't answer', or 'Not applicable' (See Table 2). The intention was that the AMSTAR profile would inform the conclusions drawn from the evidence pertinent to each question. The AMSTAR judgements are included in this report, but they proved to be of limited use. A review could score well on descriptive elements (such as including a list of included and excluded studies, providing deta ils of the characteristics of included studies, assessing and documenting the quality of studies, and stating confli cts of interest), but these did not necessarily impact on the quality of the methods or conclusions drawn. Whilst AMSTAR allows for that, the measure did not appear to adequately differentiate amongst the included reviews. Reporting the evidence In each section, we report the ex tent, range and quality of the existing evidence in 'at a glance' tables. In addition, we discuss the weight of evidence about the effectiveness of particular interventions, and we co nsider the quality of that evidence, the nature of any conflicting evidence, and the possible explanations for this. Adverse effects or unintended consequences are also identified. Where available, we have drawn on reviews of qualitative research, process and implementation research to complement or interpret the findings of intervention reviews. Each section concludes with an overview of what appear to be significant gaps in our knowledge base. These sections were informed by discussions with stakeholders (see below). 21Table 2 AMSTAR Quality Assessment Tool Quality components Description Was an \"a priori\" design provided? The research question and inclusion criteria should be established before the conduct of the review. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Was there duplicate study selection and data extraction? There should be at least two independent data extractors and a consensus procedure for disagreements should be in place. Was a comprehensive literature search performed? At least two electronic sources should be searched. The report must include years and databases used (e.g. Central, EM BASE, and MEDLINE). Key words and/or MESH terms must be stated, and where f easible, the search strategy should be provided. All searches should be supplemented by consulting current contents, reviews, textbooks, specialized registers, or experts in the particular field of study, and by reviewing the references in the studies found. Was the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion? The authors should state that they searched for reports regardless of their publication type. The authors should state whether or not they excluded any reports (from the systematic review) based on their publication status, language, etc. Was a list of studies (included and excluded) provided? A list of included and excluded studies should be provided. Were the characteristics of the included studies provided? In an aggregated form, such as a table, data from the original studies should be provided on the participants, interventions, and outcomes. The ranges of characteristics in all the studies anal yzed (e.g. age, race, sex, relevant socioeconomic data, disease status, duration, severity, or other diseases should be reported). Was the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented? 'A priori' methods of assessment should be provided (e.g. for effectiveness studies if the author(s) chose to include only randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, or allocation concealment as inclusion criteria); for other types of studies, alternative items will be relevant. Was the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions? The results of the methodological rigor and scientific quality should be considered in the analysis of the review, and explici tly stated in formulating recommendations. Were the methods used to combine the findings of the studies appropriate? For the pooled results, a test should be done to ensure the studies were combinable, to assess their homogeneity (i.e.. chi-squared test for homogeneity, I\u00b2). If heterogeneity exists, a random effects mo del should be used and/or the clinical appropriateness of combining should be taken into consideration (i.e. is it sensible to combine?) Was the likelihood of publication bias assessed? An assessment of publication bias should include a combination of graphical aids (e.g. funnel plot, other available tests) and/ or statistical tests (e.g. Egger regression test) Was the conflict of interest stated? Potential sources of su pport should be clearly acknowledged in both the systematic review and the included studies. 22Consultation with stakeholders As a means of ensuring that the resulting review was maximally relevant to the Northern Ireland context, we combined evidence from published and unpublished reviews with evidence from key stakeholders in the field of Child and Adolescent Mental Health. The purpose of drawing on key stakeholders was to ensure that we did not duplicate work already done, and that the identification of priorities for re search reflected gaps in the evidence and clinical priorities. The involvement of key stakeholders also helped address some of the limitations of a 'review of reviews', which often exclude local data and project evaluations and expert and practitioners opinions (see Bamba et al. 2010; Bull et al. 2004). Using our networks, we identified stakeholders within the broad field of Child and Adolescent Mental Health, including those who use services. As per protocol, we met with stakeholders at the outset of the review process to ensure that we were not missing any important issues, and again in week Mental health problems among children and young people in Northern Ireland In this chapter, we consider what we know about the mental health problems of children and young people in Northern Ireland, and whether or not a Northern Ireland prevalence study is needed. We begin by setting out the meaning of prevalence, incidence and epidemiology. We then provide a detailed outline of three recent summa ries of current data about the mental health of children and young people in Great Britain (Department of Health 2011a) and Northern Ireland (Bamford Review 2006; DHSSPS 2011), be fore summarising the available evidence, both from reviews and from single studies. In contrast to other chapters, there is a greater emphasis on the methodologies used to estimate prev alence as this may help inform the approach to any research that might be undertaken in Northern Ireland and may facilitate international comparison. Terminology: prevalence, incidence and epidemiology In this chapter, 'prevalence' refers to the overall level of mental health problems, amongst children and young people, at any one time. Prevalence is sometimes expressed as a ratio (calculated by dividing the number of people with mental health problems by the number of people in the population) and sometimes as a perc entage (the ratio multiplied by 100), but these figures will generally not be the focus here. When measured on one day, pr evalence is sometimes referred to as point prevalence. Less commonly, prevalence can be measured over time - often a year - when it is referred to as period prevalence (Critchton 2000). It is important to distinguish prevalence from in cidence, which, in this context, would be the number of children and young people who develop a mental health problem over a particular period of time. Again, incidence is sometimes expressed as a proportion or percentage, calculated by dividing the number of new cases by the population. Some of the studies referred to in this chapter are also described as epidemiological studies. Epidemiology is the broad term for the study of the distribution and determinants of health, which includes the consideration of both prevalence and incidence (Sedgwick 2010). Background Depending on environment and circumstances, up to 20% of children in Great Britain may experience a clinically defined mental health problem at some time (Meltzer et al. 2000). The prevalence of mental health problems has risen steadily for over 50 years (Collishaw et al. 2004). Children looked after are particularly vulnerable because of maltreatment, disruptions in, or poor quality relationships with, their families of origin (Meltzer et al. 2004). There is evidence that the Troubles have contributed to poor mental health within Northern Ireland (NI), both through their impact on the social and economic circumstances of individuals and neighbourhoods (Bamford 2006b) and more directly via trauma, bereavement and 2007a,b; Fay et et al. 2008; Leavey et al. 2009). The Commission for Victims and Survivors (2010) has highlighte d that: ..there are limitations and gaps in the res earch relating to trans-generational issues of the Conflict and their impact on present and future generations of young people...The 26potential impact of trans-generational issues on the lives of past, present and future generations of young people in Northern Ireland could emerge as of one of most enduring consequences of the Conflict. (Commission for Victims and Survivors 2010: 141). Despite improvements in socio-ec onomic and environmental factors, social inequalities persist, and many continue to live lives exposed to violence and intimidation (Cairns et al. 2003; Ferry et al. 2008). The impact of the Troubles on rates of suicide is less clear, but notwithstanding the problems associated with the official statistics, NI appears to have higher-than-average rates of attempted and completed suicide amongst young people, at least in certain areas (Largey et al. 2009). We know that socio-economic disadvantage pl aces children at increased risk of exposure to poor parental health, including mental ill health, and that such children are themselves at increased risk (Buchanan and Brinke 1997; Emerson 2007). We know less about the ways in which the Troubles (may) have affected post-1998 generations of children (see Smyth 1998; Smyth et al. 2004; DHSSPS 2004), but we know that NI has higher rates of both socio-economic deprivation and psychological morbidity amongst adults. Amongst the gaps in research highlighted in Bamford was the need for a prevalence survey of the mental health needs of children and young people in NI. Three recent summaries provide a more detailed indication of what is currently known about the mental health of children and young people. In the GB context, one of the supporting reports (DoH 2011a) for the current policy document No Health without Mental Health (DoH 2011b) provides an overview of prevalence but also explores some of the underlying associations with inequality. It states that: One in ten children and adolescents between the ages of one and 15 has a mental disorder, which can be divided into the following categories: Conduct Disorders: 6% of 5-16 year olds have a conduct disorder although 18% have sub-threshold conduct problems. Conduct disorders are more common in boys than in girls. Emotional Disorders: 4% of 5-16 year olds have an emotional disorder. They are more common in girls and include anxieties, depression and phobias. Hyperkinetic Disorders: 2% of 5-16 year olds have a hyperkinetic disorder. Less Common Disorders: 1% of all 5-16 year olds suffer from less common disorders such as autism, eating disorders, tics and selective mutism. Autistic Spectrum Disorders: These are more common in boys. The spectrum ranges from Asperger's Syndrome to more extensive forms of learning disability and difficulties in interacting and communicating with others. Eating Disorders: Eating disorders are more common in young women. Up to 1% of women in the UK between the ages of 15 and 30 suffer from anorexia nervosa, and about 2-3% develop bulimia nervosa. Research also suggests that 20% of children have a mental health problem in any given year, and about 10% at any one time. The UK also came bottom of the rank for children's wellbeing compared with North America and 18 European countries and 24th out of 29 European countries in more recent survey (DoH 2011: 3-4). This report also highlights that risk factors for mental health problems during childhood and adolescence are associated with a broad range of those factors linked to inequality, including: alcohol, drug or tobacco use during pregnancy; maternal stress during pregnancy; poor maternal mental health; poor parenting skills; deprivat ion; and three or more adverse childhood 27experiences. The report acknowledges that ine quality affects certain groups more than others, with looked after children experiencing a five-fold increased risk of any childhood mental health problem, young offenders a three-fold increased risk of mental health problems and children of prisoners a three-fold increase in the risk of an tisocial behaviour. Homeless young people are also disproportionately affected (page 6). In the Northern Ireland context, the Bamford Report (2006) acknowledged that: Very little epidemiological study of child mental health problems has been carried out in Northern Ireland and the rates of many problems and disorders have to be extrapolated from British and international studies. The influential study of 10,000 children aged 5-15 published by the Office of National Statistics (ONS) [Green et al. 2005] was only carried out in England, Wales and Scotland and did not extend to NI...However NI is distinguished by higher levels of socio economic deprivation, ongoing civil strife and higher prevalence of psychological morbidity in the adult population. It is likely therefore that the prevalence of mental health problems and disorders in children and young people will be greater in NI than in other parts of the United Kingdom (UK). The Chief Medical Officer's report, Health of the public in Northern Ireland, estimated that more than 20% of young people are suffering \"significant mental health problems\" by thei r 18th birthday. (Bamford Review 2006: 5). One of the conclusions of the Bamford report was, as indicated above, that 'A study of the mental health needs of children in Northern Ireland should be commissioned as soon as possible' (p.25). In 2011, the DHSSPS issued, for consultation, a draft Service Framework for Mental Health and Wellbeing. In addition to the statistics above, the report notes that i n 2008, 29% of respondents to the Young Life and Times Survey (a survey of 941 children aged 16 years) recorded scores on the General Health Questi onnaire (GHQ-12) that indicated they were potential sufferers of a psychiatric disorder (Schubotz 2010). The recently completed, but not yet published, Northern Ireland Study of Health and Stress (NISHS) ( www.science.ulster.ac.uk/research/psychology/nishs ) is one of the largest population studies of mental health in Northern Ireland. NISHS is part of the ongoing World Mental Health Survey Initiative (Kessler and Ustun 2008) that is being conducted in over 28 countries under the auspices of the World Health Organisation (WHO) (Ferry et al. 2008). It used the Composite International Diagnostic Interv iew (CIDI) (Kessler and Ustun 2004) for data collection. Although children were not included in the study in Northern Ireland, young people were included in some countries and lifetime prevalence is considered. The NISHS will provide an important foundation and possible methodological direction for any prevalence study of the mental health problems of children and young people in Northern Ireland. Results of the search The search strategy (see Appendix 1, p.213) identified 468 records, of which 51 were duplicates leaving 417. Of these, 398 were judged irrelevant as they were not directly concerned with the general prevalence of mental health problems among children and young people. Amongst these were papers that focused on the specific mental health problems, sub-populations (e.g. children with disabilities), and associated factors (e.g. abuse and adversity) and interventions. A further seven reviews were identified through Google and Google Schola r keyword search es, resulting in a total of 26 reviews that were considered in fu rther detail. The inclusion criteria were very broad and these are listed in Box 3. We identified only one systematic review (Goodman et al. 2009). Given the paucity of systematic reviews, we included two other review papers, one of which was 28a narrative literature review (Baumeister and H\u00e4rter 2007) and the other a review of three studies conducted in the UK. The last was included because of its potential relevance to NI. BOX 3: Inclusion criteria - reviews of prevalence studies POPULATION: children and young people with mental health problems INTERVENTION: assessment of general prevalence COMPARISON: no comparison required OUTCOME: estimates of prevalence Included studies Table 3.2 sets out the characteristics of included studies. The coverage of the included studies offers some consideration of the benefits, issues and possible methods for a prevalence study in Northern Ireland. The review by Baumeister and H\u00e4rter (2007) currently provides the most comprehensive review of the international literature on general prevalence surveys. Described by the authors as a 'non- systematic review', it nonetheless was clear about its inclusion criteria, was focusing on national surveys (which suggests the search strategy was comprehensive), and provided information on included (though not excluded) studies. Whilst the authors do not make explicit whether they assessed the quality of the included studies, their discussion suggests that they were mindful of this, and the conclusions they draw are cau tious, recognising the differences between methodological approaches used in each of the included studies. Collishaw et al. (2004) reviewed three general population prevalence studies of adolescents to consider possible time trends. Two of the studies covered the UK (the National Child Development Study and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study); the third covered Great Britain (the Adolescent Mental Health Survey). This review was included, as it was immediately relevant. Its focus on UK studies meant that its search did not extend beyond these (known) studies. However, methodologically, its strengths are that: it has an explicit set of aims and approach; provides information on the included studies; addresses th eir scientific quality, and uses these judgments appropriately to compare data across the studies. This was possible as comparable questionnaires were used by the studies across the three time points (1974, 1986 and 1999). The third included review was a rigorous, high quality systematic review by Goodman and his colleagues (Goodman et al. 2008) but its focus was on comparing prevalence of mental health problems among children and young people across different ethnic groups in Britain, and exploring how these findings may relate to mental health service use. Quality of reviews The quality of the included studies and reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR criteria and the results are presented in Table 3.1. Although this tool was designed to examine systematic reviews and there was only one systematic review identified for this area, the AMSTAR criteria provide a consistent approach for presenting some of the methodological characteristics of the included studies. 29Table 3.1: AMSTAR ratings - reviews of prevalence studies 'A priori\" design?

As Baumeister and H\u00e4rter (2007) put it, the identification of under-treatment, over-treatment, and inadequate treatment of the population demonstrates the usefulness of ascertaining prevalence rates. Baumeister and H\u00e4rter (2007) conclude that a 'considerable proportion of the population ... (has) .. a mental disorder', with the most frequent within the 12 months preceding data collection being mood disorders (6.6%-11.9%) and anxiety disorders (5.6% - 18.1%). Substance misuse disorders and somatoform disorders were also very frequent (3.8%-11.2% and 11% respectively). They conclude that important risk factors are being female, unmarried and unemployed, and having low social status. However, for the purpose of this rapid review, it is important to note that, as well as not being a systematic review, only 13 of the 29 included surveys included young people. Methodologically, Baumeister and H\u00e4rter's revi ew (2007) reinforces the need to consider approaches that will enable inte rnational comparison as well as provide country-specific data. They suggest that there should be some consideration of what appropriate thresholds are for mental health problems in such surveys (at present usually diagnostic thresholds), and possibly some exploration of the prevalence of mental health problems that may not meet such thresholds, but have an important im pact on people's lives. 30Table 3.2: Reviews of studies of the prevalence of mental health problems in children and young people. Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To provide a comprehensive overview of knowledge about the prevalence of mental disorders (non systematic review). Baumeister and H\u00e4rter 2007 34 General population surveys using DSM-III-R, DSM-IV or ICD-10 criteria and including at least frequent mood and anxiety disorders Wide range of countries including Northern Ireland - (McConnell et al. 2002 prevalence in Derry but the focus was on adults (18-64)) Mainly 18 and over but some studies (13) included young people Range of instruments used. The World Health Organization (WHO)'s Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) highlighted. Representative epidemiological surveys demonstrate their usefulness in the results of surveys of under-treatment, over-treatment, and inadequate treatment of the population. Specific future tasks of prevalence research of mental disorders are: i) Need for country-specific and international prevalence data; ii) threshold explorations and sub-threshold disorders, and iii) Coverage of disorders not yet assessed. To assess the extent to which conduct, hyperactive and emotional problems have become more common over a 25- year period in 3 general population samples of UK adolescents. Collishaw et al. 2004 3 general population prevalence studies of adolescents Two UK - National Child Development Study (NCDS) and the 1970 Birth Cohort Study (BCS) One GB - Adolescent Mental Health Survey (BCAMHS) (Meltzer et al. 2003) Adolescent sweeps of the NCDS, 1970 BCS and the 1999 BCAMHS. Comparable questionnaires completed by parents of 15-16- yr. olds at 1974, 1986, and 1999). NCD and 1970 BCS used the Rutter A scale (Rutter et al. 1970; Elander and Rutter 1996) BCAMHS used the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997). Evidence of i) a substantial increase in conduct problems over the 25-year study period across gender, class and family types' and ii) a rise in emotional problems. Mixed evidence in relation to rates of hyperactive behaviour. Analyses using longitudinal data from the first two cohorts indicate that long-term outcomes for adolescents with conduct problems were closely similar, suggesting that observed trends were unaffected by possible changes in reporting thresholds. To compare the population-based prevalence of child mental disorders between ethnic groups in Britain, and relate these findings to ethnic differences in mental health service use. Goodman et al. 2008 58 included studies covered 49 independent samples of children. 31-population- based. 18-clinic- based. Britain Living in Britain; aged 0-19 years; sampled from the general population or from mental health clinics serving the general population Twenty-two of the 31 population-based studies in this review relied exclusively on brief mental health questionnaires which may not sufficiently consider cultural/ethnic issues. Improvements needed in measurement of ethnicity and the evaluation of mental health outcomes. A more rigorous and systematic approach needed for the challenges posed by cross- cultural research, such as using detailed interview-based measures in addition to questionnaires. The prevalence of common mental health problems in the main minority ethnic groups in Britain seems to be similar to or, in some minorities, lower than that of White British children. 31Collishaw et al. 's (2004) focus was specifically on the extent to which conduct, hyperactive and emotional problems have become more common over a 25-year period (data collection in 1974, 1986 and 1999) in three general population samples of UK adolescents. The review was designed to inform the often expressed view that young people are more badly behaved and have more emotional difficulties than those in the past. They reported a substantial increase in conduct problems over the 25-year period, and some evidence for a recent rise in emotional problems. They concluded there is an urgent need to explore the underlying reasons for these increases, in order to inform individual and societal level interventions. Goodman et al. (2009) found that, for common disorders, 'the population-based studies suggest that Black African and Indian children may enjoy better mental health than White British children, while the mental health of Mixed race, Black Caribbean, Pakistani and Bangladeshi children is similar' (p7). They note that there may be higher rate for some less common disorders, but that the causes of these patterns need to be explored. They suggest that to do so would include more in- depth consideration of ethnic and cultural issues in prevalence studies. Implications for research and practice These studies and reviews reinforce the Bamford (2006) recommendation that a study of the mental health needs of children in Northern Ireland is needed, and should be commissioned as soon as possible. The fact that, within the UK, the tw o most commonly cited surveys - which did not include Northern Ireland - were completed in 1999 and 2004, strengthens the case (Meltzer et al. 2000; Green et al. 2005). Further, there is ongoing debate about the possible trends in the mental health of children and young people (Costello et al. 2006b; Maughan et al. 2008; Dorling 2009) and some uncertainty about this. There are issues about the Northern Ireland context, which mean that relying on data from other countries could be misleading. The most obvious is the conflict and, as the Commission for Victims and Survivors (2010) has highlighted, the extent and nature of the direct and especially trans-generational impact of the Troubles needs to be further investigated. Other important Northern Ireland specific factors are the nature of service provision, including wider issues such as housing and education, and the unique demographics. A Northern Ireland prevalence study would also allow the exploration of some important developing themes from the research literature, such as inequa lities in mental health and the nature and extent of parental mental health problems. It would be extremely important to carefully consider the methodology of a Northern Ireland prevalence study to enable international comparison , but also to provide an important contribution to the epidemiology of mental health problems amongst children and young people. The two large national surveys of children aged 5-15 in Great Britain, mentioned above (Meltzer et al. 2000; Green et al. 2005), are repeatedly referred to in the local, national and international literature, and a central methodological consideration for a Northern Ireland study. There do seem to be some instruments which are very commonly used and so would facilitate comparison. These include: the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman 1997), which has been used in the Northern Ireland context with looked after children (Whyte and Campbell 2008); the Composite Internationa l Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (Kessler and Ustun 2004), which was used in the World Mental Health Survey Initiative that includes the Northern Ireland Study of Health and Stress; the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) (Achenbach 1991); and the Development and Well Being Assessment (DAWBA) (Goodman et al 2000). Srinath et al. (2010) appealed for a consensus in the use of common instruments and suggested using the SDQ or CBCL for a first stage with multiple informants, an d then for the second stage using DISC or DAWBA. The need to 32include consideration of cultural and ethnic issues (Goodman et al. 2008) was also emphasized, and the importance of, in combination with structured interviews, to enable consideration of the subjective experiences of children and young people (Williams 2005). Not addressed in this review There are two further specific research areas that should be considered in terms of prevalence and needs but are not specifically addressed in this review. They are the needs of young people moving or transitioning from Child and Adolescent Mental H ealth Services to adult mental health services; and the mental health needs of children with learning disabilities. In terms of the transition between services, the Bamford Review (2006) reported that ' The transfer of care between child and adolescent services an d adult services usually occurs around the age of 18. Arrangements in NI at present could be considered informal and too dependent on local networks and professional relationships. Clearer guidelines and greater flexibility are required.' (p.17). In the Service framework for mental health and wellbeing: Consultation document (DHSSPS 2010), it was acknowledged that transitio n between services can cause anxiety for the young person, their family and carers and thresholds for accessing services can be variable. It therefore proposes that the standard should be that 'A young person approaching their 18th birthday (between 3-6 months) receiving treatment and care for a significant health problem from CAMHS or a Paediatric service should be assessed, their need for services identified and where appropriate, arrangements should be made for transition to adult services. These arrangements should be made in partnership with the young person and their family/carers.' (Standard 31, p.132). Early involvement, careful planning and close inter-agency working are needed to ensure that the transition between services works well and this pr ocess should be the subject of local research. Singh et al. (2010) concluded that \"there are two basic and contrasting approaches to improving care for young people undergoing transition from CAMHS to AMHS. We can improve the interface between CAMHS and AMHS as they currently exist, or we can develop a completely new and innovative service model of integrated youth mental health services\" (p.173) and research is needed to identify the local issues and inform how services should develop. It is also important to consider how this area may be relevant to and overlap with the other rapid reviews, perhaps especially in terms of early intervention (Marshall and Rathbone, 2011), as these services are intended to work with young people through early adulthood (typically from ages 14-35, Department of Health, 2001). The mental health needs of children with learning disabilities should be considered in more depth for a number of reasons. The first is that \"Over on e in three children and adolescents with a learning disability in [Great] Britain (36%) have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder. Children and adolescents with learning disabilities are over six times more likely to have a diagnosable psychiatric disorder than their peers who do not have learning disabilities\" (Emerson and Hatton, 2007, p.iii). The Bamford Review (2005 ) reported that: the specific n eeds of children with learning disabilities are often not addressed in wider poli cy developments for children and young people; these families are more likely to experiences other forms of disadvantage; and, in general people with learning disabilities should have equal access to specialist mental health services rather than having their mental health needs addressed within learning disability services. A further issue is that people with learning disabilities are often excluded fr om mental health research on the basis of their learning disability and so there is an increased need for research in this area. 33References: included studies Baumeister, H. and H\u00e4rter, M.

We found no reviews that assessed interventions designed to promote the early identification of help seeking behaviours from either parents, young people or others, despite this being a focus of attention in the literature, seeking to understand how young people do or do not get the help they need (Zwaanswijk et al. 2003). Over-represented in need, under-represented in services. Young people aged 15 to 24 years are more likely to have mental health and substance abuse problems and more unmet care needs than adults older than 25 years old (Anderson and Lowen 2010). Although, worldwide, it is estimated that up to 20% of children and adolescents experience poor mental health, only a minority receive any kind of mental health care or are formally diagnosed (see Anderson and Lowen 2010; Shandley et al. 2010; Zwaanswijk et al. 2003). Amongst the possible reasons for this, some have argued that young people might avoid seeking help and may experience delayed referral (Rothi and Leavey 2006). In an earlier overview published in 2003, Zwaanswijk et al. identified 47 studies concerned with parental and adolescent problem recognition and he lp seeking, and problem recognition by general practitioners. The focus of the studies was emotional and behavioural problems. A number of factors lead to help-seeking by children and adolescents for mental health and behavioural problems. Evidence from two and seven studies respectively, indicated that co-morbidity and severity of problems increased the likelihood of them seeking help for their child. The data from seven included studies indicate that parents are more likely to seek help for young children and those in early adolescence, and for boys rather than girls, but this reverses in late adolescence, probably reflecting the changing nature of presenting problems from externalising to internalising problems. Data from four included studies suggested that help-seeking was increased for children with additional medical or school-related problems, but this was not associated with increased problem recognition by parents, suggesting that teachers ar e potentially important sources of identification and referral for children and adolescents with mental health problems. Three included studies indicated that parental problem recognition and he lp seeking appears to be influenced by: the distress/burden experienced by parents in raising the child; parental attitudes and beliefs; their education level, and family stress. Three studies suggest that the presence of siblings is associated with a reduction in the likelihood of parents recognising a child's problem, but not with a decrease in the chances of parental help- seeking. For children in foster care, help is more likely to be sought for the consequences of sexual and physical abuse ('active' abuse) than of neglect or caretaker absence. The evidence for the impact of maltreatment on help-seeking comes from only two studies. Single studies suggest that training and interv iew techniques impact on problem recognition by GPs, as does the availability of and use of screening measures (two studies). Unsurprisingly, evidence from two studies indicate that knowing children and /or longer contacts increase GP's identification of problems. 38Results of the search The search strategy identified 34 records. A further 4 were identified through a Google search. Of the 38 records, 23 were either book reviews or ed itorials, or were related only to physical health problems and/or did not include help-seeking behaviours. Of the remaining 15 publications, 11 were judged irrelevant and thus excluded. Table 4.4 sets out the reasons for their exclusion. In total, 5 reviews met the inclusion criteria, which are listed in Box 4. Box 4: Inclusion criteria - reviews of help seeking behaviours POPULATION: children, young people, and their parents; lay and professional workers INTERVENTION/Topic: help-seeking behaviours fo r mental health problems in children and young people COMPARISON: any comparison Included reviews Table 4.1 sets out the characteristics of included reviews. One review is concerned with the barriers and facilitators to help-seeking (Gulliver et al. 2010). A second deals with interventions aiming to improve health literacy as a strategy to aid ea rly treatments for mental health problems (Kelly et al. 2010). The other two focus on ways to make primary health care services more youth-friendly and accessible (Anderson and Lowen 2010; Tyler et al. 2007). There are considerable gaps in the research as discussed below. Scope and Quality of reviews on help-seeking behaviours for children and young people's mental health problems Table 4.2 provides an overview of how each of the included reviews scored on the AMSTAR criteria. All reviews provide evidence that the inclusion criteria for their reviews were established before undertaking the work. All provided information about the search strategy, though most did not go beyond that i.e. whilst all searched more than one database and provided information about these, three provided key words and /or MESH terms (Gulliver et al. 2010; Anderson and Lowen 2010; Tylee et al. 2007) and none provided the search strategy (though this may have been a journal limitation). Only two searched other sources (Kelly et al. 2010; and Anderson and Lowen 2010). Although unable to make an assessment based on the publications, it is unlikely that double data extraction was conducted in any of the reviews (one explicitly discussed the identification and exclusion of duplicates). Only one review included a list of excluded studies and none assessed publication bias or the issue of conflict of interest. Gulliver et al.' s review was not an effectiveness review, but was the only one to conduct a meta- analysis. This was appropriate given the heterogeneity implicit in the inclusion criteria of the intervention reviews. The review by Anderson and Lowen (2010) has a particularly poor quality profile, but all have serious methodological shortcomings. What follows is a summary of the findings drawn by the authors of the four reviews. The absence of meta-analysis, combined with the sources of potential bias summarised in Table 4.4, mean that these are based on some form of 'vote counting' at best; at worst, they are rather impressionistic and subjective. 39Table 4.1: Systematic reviews on help-seeking behaviours from parents, children and young people Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting1 Participants To identify models of health care delivery that support youth access to health and mental health care.

We then consider the implications for help-seeking, models of service delivery, and mental health literacy interventions. Table 4.3: Interventions and Authors' Concl usions - Reviews of help seeking behaviour Author/Year Interventions Authors' Conclusions Anderson and Lowen 2010 Sources of youth health care (the role of parents/family; family physicians; schools; community-based health care centres; and other access points). Little systematic integration or application of adolescent health and mental health practice. School based health centres and community- based settings might be better positioned to address the unique health and mental health needs of adolescents. Gulliver et al. 2010 N/A Stigma and embarrassment, poor mental health literacy, and a preference for self-reliance were the most prominent barriers to help-seeking for mental health problems. Facilitators were less well researched, but evidence points to positive past experiences, social support and encouragement from others. Kelly et al. 2007 Public awareness campaigns; Community-awareness campaign targeted at young people; School-based interventions; Programs training individuals to intervene. Few interventions to improve mental health literacy of young people/ their helpers have been evaluated, and fewer still have been well evaluated. Despite the limitations of the evidence, it is clear that mental health literacy can be improved through planned interventions. Tylee et al. 2007 A variety of interventions including: School based health services; Preventive care; Nurse-led general practice wellness visits; Quality improvement for management of depression. Only one study reported the effect of an intervention on the outcome of a disorder. Two randomised control trials showed evidence of improved provider performance in addressing youth health issues, with appropriate training in adolescent health given to primary-care practitioners. 1. Barriers to help-seeking All reviews touch on what are perceived to be the barriers to help-seeking behaviour. The review by Gulliver et al. (2010) concludes that the most prominent barrier to help-seeking for mental health problems among young people has been found to be stigma and embarrassment about seeking help. Other barriers include: fear about lack of confidentiality regarding the potential source of help; difficulty in identifying the symptoms of mental illness (poor mental health literacy); poor accessibility, in terms of time, transport or cost, especially for rural populations; self-reliance; concern about characteristics of the provider (e.g. their ability to provide help or their credibility); lack of knowledge about mental health services, and fear about the act of help-seeking or the source of help (e.g. that the health practitioner will scold them or ask difficult questions). Gulliver et al. 2010; Anderson and Lowen 2010; Tylee et al. 2007. 41Anderson and Lowen (2010) argue that another important barrier is insufficient youth-related training for health care providers. 2. Facilitating help-seeking Much less is known from these reviews about what facilitates help-seeking. Gulliver et al. (2010) conclude from their review that the most prominen t facilitator to help-seeking is positive past experiences with help-seeking, which in turn might increase mental health literacy. Another facilitator would be social support and encouragement from others. Evidence from the included reviews suggests that young people are not likely to consult family physicians or GPs for help for personal or emotional problems (Anderson and Lowen 2010). In the UK, delays in securing appointments in some facilities may exacerbate a natural disinclination. Young people are most likely to seek help for mental health problems from friends and family, rather than turn elsewhere for help. Thus, parents continue to play a crucial role in identifying mental health problems in young people, and helping them seek health care (Anderson and Lowen 2010; Tylee et al. 2007). It is possible that locating services in places that are more accessible to young people, such as locating health care centres in schools (Anderson and Lowen 2010), may improve help-seeking behaviour. In places like Australia, schools have been found to be a key setting for the delivery of health care to youth, as health clinics in schools are used by most of the pupils. For instance, a school-based, physician-led programme that trained GPs in 'youth-friendly' practice, and helped students understand what family doctors do and how to access them, resulted in an increase students' intentions to seek help, reduced perceived barriers to seeking help, and lead students who intended to seek help to actually do so (p782). In their review of studies of the impact of different models of 'youth friendly health provision', Tylee et al. (2007) report that family care practitioners have expressed a need for better training in youth health care, to help them recognise and deal with mental health problems, and there is some evidence of improved performance outcomes when appropriate training is provided. Although there is a diversity of youth-friendly health initiatives developing around the world, such as the school-based programme mentioned above, the evaluations of these programmes are poorly designed and implemented, with results that are prone to bias (Tylee et al. 2007). Robust evaluations of these initiatives are needed. In ad dition, Anderson and Lowen (2010) reinforce this with their conclusions that there appears to be little systematic integration, application, and evaluation of adolescent health and mental health practice, thus more research needs to be conducted identifying the gaps in care and service. 3. Interventions to improve mental health literacy It has been argued that mental health literacy can improve children and young people's emotional wellbeing, 'either by facilitating early help-seeking by young pe ople themselves, or by helping adults to identify early signs of mental disorders and seek help on their behalf' (Kelly et al. 2007: s26). Jorm et al. (1997, p182) defined mental health literacy as: ..knowledge and beliefs about mental disorders which aid their recognition, management or prevention. Mental health literacy includes the ability to recognize specific disorders; knowing how to seek mental health information; knowledge of risk factors and causes, of self-treatments, and of professional help available; and attitudes that promote recognition and appropriate help-seeking. 42Unfortunately, poor mental health literacy is prevalent among young people (and adults), making it likely that many will fail to recognise mental illn esses, and / or seek appr opriate professional help and treatments (ibid). Schools are a key setting for interventions aimed at improving mental health literacy among children and young people, and have a fundamental role to play in primary prevention (Bamford 2006). The one review that examined studies of the effectiveness of mental health literacy programmes concluded that these were thin on the ground and not well evaluated (Kelly et al. 2007). Some of the interventions evaluated sought to increase the mental health literacy of the whole community (whole-of-community campaigns). Others specifically targeted young people, via community campaigns aimed at a youth audience; school-based interventions teaching help-seeking skills, mental health literacy or resilience; and training programmes on how to intervene in a mental health crisis. Despite the limitations of the evidence available, Kelly et al. (2007) concluded that we could improve mental health literacy through carefully planned interventions. Northern Ireland We found no examples in Northern Ireland of initiatives especially designed to promote help- seeking behaviour, other than anti-stigma campaigns. A number of these have been launched, aimed at encouraging people to change their at titudes to mental illness. They include: a Rethink anti-stigma campaign in 2007, that included a TV comm ercial titled 'Down the Pub'; the film festival Mind' at the QFT, and the NICCY 'Make it Right Campaign' in October 2010 for 'emotional health and wellbeing'. The impact of these campaigns on attitudinal or be havioural change is un clear. An absence of evaluation means that there is, as yet, no evidence base to steer policy or practice. In Northern Ireland, among representatives from statutory, voluntary and community sectors involved in the promotion of mental health, there is support for a renewed focus on school-based mental health promotion (Leavey et al. 2009). For instance, the Public Health Agency funds and supports the delivery of the Aware Mood Matters Programme , delivered by the charity Aware Defeat Depression, and offered to young people in post-primary schools. The programme, launched in 2000, aims to enhance understanding of depression as well as promoting positive mental health. Each year, presentations are delivered across Northern Ireland to young people in schools, colleges and other youth organisations, and teachers' resources are supplied to enable staff to discuss the material before and after each presentation. In addition, internet-based source s of help, such as Heads Away ( http://www.heads-away-just- say.com/ ), are increasingly being used by young people, with some evidence of potential effectiveness (Christensen et al. 2004). Implications for practice Mental health literacy Gulliver et al. (2010) suggest that policies aimed at improving mental health among young people should address young people's wish for self-reliance by: i) providing evidence-based self-help material; ii) providing programmes designed to increase young people's mental health literacy, in particular, knowledge of their own symptoms; and 43iii) providing programmes designed to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and mental health help-seeking. Anti-stigma campaigns Regarding anti-stigma campaigns and me ntal health literacy interventions, the components that appear to be particularly promising are: Appropriately tailored messages designed to appeal to different groups (achieved by carrying out preliminary qualitative research with the audience to whom the messages will be directed; and dividing the intended audience into relatively homogenous groups, so that messages address the needs and preferences of these groups); An established theoretical base on which to build up the campaign; Use of appropriate types of media to place messages (e.g. cinema advertising and youth media - rather than newspapers - with appropriate channels for messages directed at adolescents); Evaluations built into the campai gn and conducted in order to ensure that the messages are reaching the target audience, and to find out whether the campaign has been successful in changing behaviours and attitudes or not (Kelly et al. 2007). Service development In terms of service development, there is 'a need for a rational, comprehensive and integrated approach', as well as 'sustainable resources and youth involvement in design and development of services' (Anderson and Lowen 2010: 783; see also Roth\u00ec and Leavey 2006). Seven key principles have been identified to improve the access and the quality of health and mental health care for young people. These are: Facilitating young people's access, by ensuring services are flexible, affordable, relevant and responsive to the needs of all young people; Offering evidence-based practice, by regula rly reviewing and developing services and programmes according to evidence of best practice; Involving young people in the development, impl ementation, review and evaluation of series and programmes; Making collaboration possible among service providers, both within and across services, fostering common service goals and target groups (i.e networking, communicating and working together); Offering those working with young people adequate and ongoing professional development, support and supervision; Developing and implementing strategies for se rvices and programmes to optimise funding, where appropriate, and Conducting regular evaluations of services, usi ng appropriate evaluation methods that examine the relevance and quality of programme s as well as their outcomes (Kang et al. 2006 - cited by Anderson and Lowen 2010). Evidence coming from these reviews suggests that we should provide GPs with the support and training they (and other primary health care providers) need to deliver adequate mental health care to children and adolescents. In addition, mental health care services locate d in schools and community-based settings may be best placed to address the mental health needs of children and young people (Anderson and Lowen 2010). A non-systematic review by Rothi and Leavey (2006) suggest that an increase in the availability of mental health professionals to schools, plus the provision of appropriate mental health-related training for existing school staff, could improve access of children and young people 44to mental health services. They also argue that youth workers are well placed to play a key role in linking marginalised youth with mental health serv ices, if they are given proper 'additional training to better identify mental health problems and to more effectively refer and collaborate with other services' (Roth\u00ec and Leavey 2006: S38). Finally, Northern Ireland (and other countries) should develop policies to encourage provision of innovative and well-assessed youth-friendly services (Tylee et al. 2007). Gaps in Evidence Given our long-standing awareness of the under-recognition of mental health problems by young people, their parents, and professionals - particular ly teachers and general practitioners - the dearth of research in this area is striking, particularly in relation to what might bring about change. The same is true of interventions designed to prev ent or overcome the barr iers to help seeking behaviour. The singular problem of youth suicide in Northern Ireland makes this a high priority area for research.

There are many factors associated with, or leading to, poor mental health and self-harm. Those addressed in the interventions reviewed here are: bullying, alcohol and substance misuse, poor social skills and low self-esteem, bereavement, and exposure to traumatic events or war and conflict. Although abuse and neglect are known to contribute to poor mental health, reviews concerned with interventions addressing these factors are dealt with in Chapter 9. This chapter begins with an overview of the nature and extent of these problems in children's lives, and how they are affected by them. Bullying There are multiple definitions of bullying, and differences have been found in how pupils and teachers define bullying (O'Brien 2009). As defined by Adi et al. (2007, see Included Studies), bullying is 'a form of aggression in which one or more children repeatedly and intentionally intimidate, harass or phys ically harm a victim who cannot easily defend him or herself' (p.8). Prevalence data on school bullying rely mostly on self-report surveys (Adi et al. 2007). One prevalence study conducted in 25 countries (one of which was Northern Ireland) reported that, on average, 10% of children reported having bullied others in that school term, and 11% reported being the victims of bullying (Nansen et al. 2004). In Northern Ireland, the mean figure for school bullying appears to be slightly higher than that reported for the 25 countries. There have been a number of surveys of bullying conducted in NI. In 2002, Collins et al. reported that 40% of primary school children and 30% of pos t-primary pupils said they had been bullied in the few months prior to data collection, and 25% of primary school children and 28% of post- primary pupils admitted that they had bullied another child (Collins et al. 2002). A survey of 819 16-year olds published in 2005 reported that 30% of respondents said they had been bullied. Of these, 28% claimed it had happened 'a lot' or 'a little' during the previous two months, while 72% said it had happened 'not at all' (Burns 2006). A larger survey of 2312 pupils (Livesay et al. 2007) found that 26% of participating Year 6 pupils and 21% of Year 9 pupils said they had been bullied once or twice in the two months prior to data collection; and 17% of participating Year 6 pupils and 8% of Year 9 pupils said that it had happened twice a month or more. These findings are of concern, since research evidence suggests that bullying behaviour and cyber-bullying can increase the risk of suicidal ideation and/or suicide atte mpts among children and young people (Brunstein et al. 2010). It is also associated with, and contributes independently to children's mental health problems, with effects that can continue until late adolescence (Arsenealut et al. 2010). In 2003, concern about the extent of bullying and an increasing recognition of children's rights led the Department of Education in Northern Ireland (DENI) to release a Statement on Bullying. This highlighted the need for every school to have a plan to prevent all types of bullying among pupils, and to consult with pupils on bullying policies (B urns 2006). Research indi cates that most pupils are aware of an anti-bullying policy in their school, but fewer than three quarters (67%) of 16-year olds were aware that there were particular staff members in their school to whom students could go for help regarding bullying, and only 15% said that they would talk to them, while 68% said 'it depends' (ibid). 48Services in Northern Ireland Prevention interventions and strategies have received increasing attention in recent years, in the UK and other countries (McElearney et al. 2008). Currently, there is an umbrella organisation in Northern Ireland, funded by the Department of Education, whose main aim is to identify and champion future anti-bullying priorities for children and young people. As of June 2010, the NI Anti-Bullying Forum (NIABF) - launched in 2005 by Save the Children - had a membership of over 25 regional statutory and voluntary organisations. It supports schools in the development of effective anti-bullying strategies. Substance abuse Adolescent alcohol and other drug (AOD) misuse are both associated with poor mental health. The prevalence of substance misuse has been describe d as 'striking' (Engle and Macgowan 2009). For instance, in the UK, since 1990, the amount of alcohol consumed by adolescents aged 11-15 has doubled, and the number of children admitted to hos pital as a direct result of their alcohol intake has also increased (Donaldson 2009). Despite being considered an area with relative low levels of drug use during the Troubles, the level of drug use in NI seems both to be increasing and happening at an earlier age (McCrystal and Winning 2009) The most common preferred drug for children aged 11 and 12 is alcohol, followed by tobacco (ibid). In 2007, local news headlines reported 'Eight-year-olds \"abusing drink\"'. The report went on to say that children as young as eight were being treated for alcohol and substance abuse in Northern Ireland (BBC news 2007). In 2009, the Medical Chief Officers of England and Wales and Northern Ireland responded to growing concerns by issuing 'Draft Guidance on the Consumption of Alcohol by Children and Young People'. They highlighted the need for support services to be available for children and young people with alcohol-related problems and their parents (Donaldson 2009). Schools are frequently the setting for drug preven tion programmes. In fact , all schools in the UK are required to provide a drugs education programme, which includes the provision of appropriate information on the risks associated with drug use (McCrystal and Winning 2009). The Government has highlighted the need to target preventive interventions at those young people most in need, i.e.those most vulnerable to drug use (Home Office 2002). Targeted interventions are thus considered as particularly beneficial. Services in Northern Ireland In addition to school-based interventions, there are a number of specialist services in Northern Ireland that target young people who misuse alcohol or other drugs. Within the statutory sector, examples include: de dicated services within the Belfast and South Eastern Health and Social Care Trusts (HSCT) (the Drug and Alcohol Mental health Service).Community-based projects aimed at reducing drug and alcohol misuse among children/young people include: Drugs awareness training and education in schools and youth centres; Counselling, such as DAYS (Drug and Alcohol Yout h Service), offering one-to-one counselling to young people aged 8-18 in the Western HSC Trust. In 2007, ASCERT (Action on Substance through Community Education and Related Training) organised a one day conference ('Why Wait?'), in partnership with Opportunity Yo uth, where findings of an evaluation on the Lifematters programme pilot were presented. The organisers concluded that the programme was successful in reducing substance misuse (Torney 2007). 49 Training for parents, such as CODA (Community Drug Awareness), the Community Drug Project (Falls Community Council) and FASA (Forum for Action on Substance Abuse) in the HSC Belfast Trust, or the Divert Pr oject in the Western HSC Trust, and Mentoring services, such as CHILL (the Drugs and Alc ohol Counselling and Mentoring Service), which is a partnership project between Opportunity Youth and Contact Youth, a mentoring and counselling service for young people aged 8-17 that are a ffected by drugs or alcohol. It gives young people an opportunity to talk about issues related to drug and alcohol consumption, and receive support. Bereavement In the UK, it has been estimated that 15 children every day are bereaved of a parent before the age of 16, and approximately 4-7% of children will lose a father or a mother (Kennedy et al. 2008). Bereavement in childhood is a painful experience, which can lead to later depression or anxiety. Because of this potential impact, there is a sizeab le therapeutic literature on how to help bereaved children (Rosner et al. 2010). However, although there is a tendency to 'pathologise' grief, only a minority of bereaved children display lasting grief complications (Currier et al. 2007). Services in Northern Ireland In the UK, there is a large charity (i.e. Cruse Bereavement Care), with branches established throughout Northern Ireland, dedicated to promoting the well-being of bereaved people, by providing free care and offering information, support and training services to those looking after them. This charity has a website designed by young people to help children and young people after the death of someone close to them ( http://www.rd4u.org.uk/ ), as well as a helpline for bereaved children, a leaflet with information tailored to young people (http://www.rd4u.org.uk/YouthBooklet.pdf ), and a guide on how to support children and young people through bereavement ( http://www.crusebereavementcare.org.uk/PDFs/SupportChildGrief.pdf ). Barnardo's Northern Ireland has also had a service since 1998 (i.e. The Child Bereavement Service), designed to provide a wide range of therapy, training and consultancy to support bereaved children. Both services are listed in the UK 'Childhood Bereavement Network' (CBN). None of these services have been rigorously evaluated. Self-esteem Low self-esteem is associated with poor mental health (Bos et al. 2006). Self-esteem is related to a range of important outcomes for children and young people, such as academic achievement and social functioning, and therefore many interventions have been developed in different settings aimed at improving children's self-esteem (ibid) . However, interventions for children and young people tend not specifically to target low self-e steem, which accompanies multiple other difficulties and problems. Results of the search The search strategy identified 227 records. A further 20 records were found in a Google search. Of the 247 records, 220 were judged i rrelevant as they were either no t concerned with treatment, were concerned with the treatment of mental disorders rather than factors known to contribute to poor mental health), were book reviews, or did not include children and young people. Amongst these were papers that focused on: interventions treating childhood depression or general mental health problems, hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, helping victims of domestic violence, PTSD, aggression and violence, conduct disorder and autism. 50Of the remaining 27 records, 19 met the inclusio n criteria listed in Box 5. Eight papers were excluded and Table 5.7 sets out the reasons for their exclusion. Box 5: Inclusion criteria - factors associated with poor mental health POPULATION: children and young people INTERVENTION: any intervention that aims to address factors known to contribute to poor mental health and self-harm (except for abuse and neglect, and more general factors such as poverty or genetic factors), i.e. bullying, poor self-esteem, substance misuse, bereavement and exposure to traumatic events/violence COMPARISON: any comparison OUTCOME: desired changes in factors contributing to poor mental health; reductions in poor mental health Included reviews Table 5.1 sets out the characteristics of included reviews. Most are concerned with school-based interventions aimed at reducing bullying (n=6), and treatments and programs aimed at reducing or preventing substance abuse (n=6). Other reviews looked at interventions addressing: bereavement (n=3), low self-esteem (n=2) and exposure to trauma (n=2). Quality of reviews Table 5.2 provides an overview of how each of the included reviews scored on the AMSTAR criteria. The quality profile of the included review s varied, although generally it was better than most areas. Ten out of the 19 reviews had duplica te study selection and data extraction, and that was made explicit in the article or report. The va st majority did not include a list of the excluded studies in the review. All but one used at least two databases for their searches and included unpublished literature. No reports provided information about excluded studies, and this criterion was scored as 'No', as there was no evidence to the contrary. Fifteen of the 19 provided information about the included studies. There were 11 meta-analyses presented in the reviews. 51Table 5.1: Characteristics of systematic reviews of interventions targeting factors associated with poor mental health in children and young people.

For children of primary and secondary school age, re views in this area have focused exclusively on school-based interventions. There is debate abou t the effectiveness of these programmes. Reviews by Ferguson et al. (2007) and Merrell et al. (2008) did not find it possible to conclude that school- based anti-bullying interventions were effective. In contrast, those by Farrington and colleagues concluded that the results were clearly encouraging (Farrington and Ttofi 2009; Ttofi and Farrington 2011). These differences might be attributab le at different search strategies and inclusion criteria: Farrington et al. (2009; 2011) included published and unpublished reports (from 1983- 2009) of experimental designs; Ferguson et al. (2007) only included randomised studies (from 1995-2006); and Merrell et al. (2008) included experimental and quasi-experimental designs of evaluations (from 1980-2004) of programmes where bullying was their primary focus of intervention. The reviews used different approaches to categorising interventions: Adi et al. (2007) classified interventions into: 1) curriculum-only programmes; 2) school and classroom behaviour management programmes; 3) bullying prevention programmes; and 4) multi-component programmes involving parent education. Vreeman and Carroll (2007) used a similar clas sification: whole- school behavioural skills group training interventions; and other interventions (i.e. an increase in the number of social workers dealing specifically on problem behaviours, and a mentoring programme for 'at-risk' children). Farrington and Ttofi did not use any classification and described each programme individually. Vreeman et al. (2007) found that the whole-school interventions (i.e. programmes including multiple disciplines and complementary elemen ts targeting different levels of the school organisation) were usually more effective in redu cing bullying than the curriculum interventions and the social skills groups. A similar finding was reported by Adi et al. (2007), who concluded that multi-component programmes were effective, as was the PeaceBuilders programme and - in the short-term - the Olweus anti-bullying (prevention) programme. The PeaceBuilders programme is a whole-school, broad behaviour management programme, which includes peer mentoring, school staff training, and parents' involvement. The Olweus anti-bullying (prevention) programme is a whole-school, multi-level programme targeting the pupil, the school, the classroom and the community level, which comprises of an 18-month intervention period and a less resource-intensive maintenance period. Farrington and Ttofi (2009; 2011) found an association between certain programme elements and a decrease in bullying. These were: parent training and meetings, firm disciplinary methods, improved playground supervision, the duration of the programme (i.e. larger number of days) for children and teachers, and the intensity of the programme (i.e. larger number of hours) for children and teachers. Perhaps counter intuitively, the formal engagement of peers in tackling bullying (e.g. peer mediation and mentoring) was associated with an increase in bullying victimization (Farrington and Ttofi 2009). Farrington and Ttofi (2009) argue that current evid ence suggests that anti-bullying programmes are promising interventions, ripe for a long-term research strategy of their effectiveness. They conclude 55that attention should be given to the development of new anti-bullying programs, drawing on those elements that appear to be most strongly associated with effective programmes. These should then be evaluated, accredited and 'supervised by an international body, such as the International Observatory on Violence in Schools. There is some evidence to suggest that the effects of interventions differ with the characteristics of children. In general, there is suggestive evidence that programmes might have more effect on boys than girls (Adi et al. 2007), on white children than black children (ibid), on high risk than low risk children (ibid; Ferguson et al. 2007), and on older (age 11 or older) than younger children (Farrington and Ttofi 2009). Table 5.3: Interventions and authors' conclusions - reviews of interventions for bullying. Author/Year Interventions Authors' Conclusions Adi et al. 2007 Primary school-based interventions for the prevention of violence and bullying Six of the 17 trials showed a clearly positive impact, and 8 showed a possibly positive impact in terms of reducing behaviour problems and bullying, and increasing social competence. Blank et al. 2010 Whole school behavioural interventions The evidence of these interventions in terms of preventing bullying and disruptive behaviour is varied. Farrington and Ttofi 2009 (updated2010); Ttofi and Farrington 2011 Bulli and Pupe (Italy) Project Ploughshares Puppets for Peace (Canada) Short Video Intervention (England) Friendly Schools (Australia) Social Skills Group Intervention (USA) Dutch Anti-bullying Programme Etc. Overall, the meta-analysis showed that school-based anti- bullying programmes are effective in reducing bullying and victimization. Particular programme elements were associated with a decrease in bullying and victimization. The review also showed that the intensity and duration of a programme was directly linked to its effectiveness. Ferguson et al. 2007 School-based anti-bullying programmes. Results from the meta-analysis suggested that overall anti- bullying programmes produced little discernible effect on youth participants. The effect for programmes targeted specifically at at-risk young people was slightly better. Merrell et al. 2008 A diversity of school-based anti-bullying interventions. The authors concluded that there is some evidence supporting the effectiveness of school anti-bullying interventions in increasing students' social competence, self-esteem and peer acceptance, and to a lesser ex tent in reducing bullying and victimization in schools. Vreeman et al. 2007 School-based anti-bullying interventions: Curriculum interventions Multi-disciplinary or 'whole school' interventions Social skills groups Mentoring Social worker support Many school-based interventions are effective in reducing bullying. Those involving multiple disciplines are especially effective, while curricular changes less often affect bullying behaviours. Alcohol and substance abuse interventions School-based prevention programmes for drug use are varied, and some appear more effective than others. Table 5.4 summarises the authors' conclusions from their reviews of interventions for substance misuse. For instance, sk ills-based interventions have been found to significantly reduce drug use, as well as improve decision-making skills and self esteem, more than any other type of school-based intervention (Faggiano et al. 2008). Group treatment interventions for adolescents 56abusing alcohol and other drugs appear to have positive outcomes, although the evidence of effectiveness is slightly weak, as only a few ro bust evaluations have been conducted (Engle and Macgowan 2009). Across interventions, most behaviour therapies (e.g. CBT, CT, etc.) and motivational interviewing have showed improved outcomes from pre-tests to follow-ups for the treatment of adolescent substance abuse, although only a few could be described as effective (Macgowan and Engle 2010). Despite that, behaviour -oriented treatments were found to result in significant reductions in alcohol use at 12-months follow-up (Tripodi et al. 2010). Individual-only treatments for reducing alcohol abuse among adolescents appeared to be more effective than family-based interventions (Tripodi et al. 2010). Although not specifically aimed at substance use prevention, it has been argued that 'parenting programmes can be effective in reducing or preventing substance use' among children less than 18 years of age (Petrie et al. 2007). The most effective ones appear to be those emphasising th e development of social skills and a sense of responsibility among young people, and that include active parental involvement. Table 5.4: Authors' conclusions - reviews of interventions for substance misuse. Author/Ye ar Interventions Authors' Conclusions Engle and Macgowan 2009 Motivational Enhancement Therapy +CBT; Behavioural-based Family and Coping Skills Cognitive-Behavioural Group Therapy Interactional Therapy Psycho-Educational Therapy Student Assistant Programme Group-Based Treatment Adolescent Group Therapy Supportive Counselling Group Minnesota Model 12-Step Ten out of the 13 treatments appeared to significantly reduce use rates of one or more substances, although only 2 met the criteria for 'possible efficacy'. The authors highlight the need for descriptions and analyses of group treatment factors, since that was lacking in these studies. Faggiano et al. 2008 School-based interventions (skills, affective, and knowledge focused): Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention Programme (ASAP) Life Skills Training Programme Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) Positive Alternatives for Youth The review shows that programmes that develop individual social skills are the most effective school- based interventions for the prevention of early drug use. Little is known about the long-term effect of interventions. Macgowan and Engle 2010 Behavioural therapies Motivational interviewing Behaviour therapies combined with psycho- social approaches Most BT interventions were judged 'probably efficacious' for substance misuse. MI treatments met the criteria for 'promising' intervention. Combined interventions only marginally classified as 'promising' interventions. Petrie et al. 2007 Parenting skills training groups Homework tasks requiring parental participation Mailed booklets Home visiting A mixture of these approaches Parenting programmes can be effective in reducing/ preventing substance abuse. Programmes focusing on active parental involvement and developing skills in social competence, self-regulation and parenting seemed to be the most effective. Tripodi et al. 2010 Substance abuse interventions, including: Behavioural and CB therapies. BSFT (brief strategic family therapy) IF-CBT (integrated family and CBT) MDFT (multidimensional family therapy) Interventions were effective in reducing alcohol use. Individual interventions seemed more effective than family-based. Effectiveness diminished as length of follow-up increased. Behaviour-oriented treatments appeared promising in attaining long-term effects. Waldron and Turner 2008 Outpatient treatments for substance misuse: 8 family-based interventions; Variations of group and individual CBT; etc. Multi-dimensional family therapy (FT), functional FT and group CBT are well-established substance abuse treatments. Other models might be effective. 57Bereavement interventions: Table 5.5 provides a summary of the findings from studies of five bereavement interventions. While Currier et al. 's (2007) review did not find a significant impact of these interventions on the child's psychological wellbeing and adjustment, Rosner et al. 's (2010) two meta-analyses indicated a small to moderate treatment effect. The difference might be attributable to the inclusion of different studies: Currier et al. included two unpublished dissertations; and Rosner et al. included two studies not included in that of Currier et al. . Database overlap between the two studies was 73% (Rosner et al. 2010). Older children appeared to benefit more from treatment than younger children (Rosner et al. 2010), and interventions appeared to deliver better outcomes when: the treatment followed closely the time of loss, and the intervention targeted 'high-risk' children or children already showing signs of difficulty (Currier et al. 2007). Rosner et al. (2010) identified music therapy interventions as having the largest effects on children and adolescents (Hilliard 2001; Dalton and Krout 2005). Another effective treatment was 'trauma/grief-focused school-based brief psychotherapy' for a very specific subgroup of severely and multiple-traumatised young people. There is not much information available regarding interventions for children bereaved through suicide, and the available evidence suggests that there are no significant positive effects of interventions when compared with no intervention. However, it has been argued that 'psychology-led group therapy for children may reduce anxiety and depression' (McDaid et al. 2008: 442). Interventions for traumatised children: Review findings suggest that CBT significantly decrease psychological harm among symptomatic children and adolescents who had experienced one or more traumatic events (Wethington et al. 2008). In war-exposed countries, school-based interventions do not appear to be effective in reducing children's mental distress (Persson and Rousseau 2009). Table 5.5: Authors' conclusions -reviews of interventions for bereavement and related trauma. Author/Year Interventions Authors' Conclusions Currier et al. 2007 Bereavement interventions, including: Peer counselling; Support groups; Weekend retreats; Group, individual and family therapy Children who received a bereavement intervention did not appear to show better outcomes than bereaved children who did not receive an intervention. McDaid et al. 2008 Bereavement group intervention; grief therapy; CBT etc. 6 of the 8 studies showed some evidence of benefit on at least one measure, but evidence was not robust. Persson and Rousseau 2009 Group based intervention Trauma/grief focused psycho-therapy Trauma healing recreational activities Psycho-educative expressive groups Mind- body experiential psycho-educative groups Although a feasible, low-cost alternative to individualized therapy, school-based group interventions for traumatized children may not be enough to reduce mental distress and might even increase it. Rosner et al. 2010 Diverse bereavement/grief preventive and psychotherapeutic interventions: from home-based family sessions to group workshops with several families; bereavement camps to more traditional group meetings. Results suggest that interventions for symptomatic children /adolescents were more effective than those for those bereaved without symptoms. Music therapy and trauma/grief-focused school based brief psychotherapy are promising treatment models. Wethington et al. 2008 Individual CBT / Group CBT Play therapy Art therapy Psycho-dynamic therapy Pharmacological therapy (symptomatic children) Psychological debriefing Results suggest that individual and group CBT can decrease psychological harm among symptomatic children and adolescents exposed to trauma. 58Interventions improv ing self-esteem: There is evidence from a Cochrane systematic review that exercise may be effective in securing short-term improvements in children's self-esteem, although more research is needed to find out what kind of exercise might give positive effects and in which setting (Ekeland et al. 2005). After school programmes designed to promote personal and social skills may also improve children's self-esteem, although the evidence is at best suggestive (Durlak et al. 2010). Table 5.6 summarises the interventions covered and the review authors' conclusions. Table 5.6: Authors' conclusions - reviews of interventions for improving self-esteem. Interventions Authors' Conclusions Durlak and Weissberg 2010 After-school programmes: 21st Century Community Learning Centres; Programmes conducted by kids and 4-H Clubs; Local community and civic initiatives. ASPs had an overall positive impact on the young people participating in these studies, particularly in terms of increased self-esteem, but not all ASPs were effective. Only the group of SAFE2 programmes showed significant effects on any outcomes. Ekeland et al. 2005 Exercise as a single intervention, or as part of a comprehensive intervention Results suggest that exercise can improve self-esteem in children and young people in the short-term. However, the authors highlight the need for well-designed RCTs with long- term follow-up. Implications for practice Schools are where many of these prevention interven tions take place, and in Northern Ireland (and the rest of the UK), schools are already required to have programmes in place to address bullying and educating pupils on the risk of substance abuse. However, the type of programmes used need to be chosen considering the evidence available. There is evidence that supports the development of certain programmes rather than others, and certain components of programmes as being especially helpful: Anti-bullying school-based interventions, such as befriending peer support programmes, have been developed in schools in Northern Ireland (McElearney et al. 2008), but there needs to be some robust research on how effective these are in reducing and preventing bullying. Regarding bereavement, some interventions are cu rrently being used in Northern Ireland (see Service in NI). However, they need to be subject to rigorous evaluation. The timing of interventions seemed to be of particular relevance in the prevention of substance abuse, where it appears that the transition from primary to secondary school appears a particularly optimum time to intervene (Petrie et al. 2007). The same appears to be the case in relation to bereavement, in terms of the time that there should be between the loss and the start of the intervention (Rosner et al. 2010). In the case of anti-bullying programmes, the evidence suggests that these need to be intensive and long-lasting to have an impact, and to target high risk children (Farrington and Ttofi 2009). Implications for research One of the recommendations made in a number of reviews was the need for evaluation studies to detail how the programmes/interventions were implemented and what their different components 2 programmes that met all the four criteria of recommended practices for skill training (sequenced, active, focused and explicit), which were 41 out of the 68 reviewed in that study. 59were, 'in order to enable researchers to know whether effects are related to key features of the intervention or key features of the evaluation' (Farrington and Ttofi 2009: 70). In addition, Engle and Macgowan (2009) highlight the need for evaluations to include details of the participant characteristics and/or associations between such characteristics and intervention outcomes. Many studies lack long-term follow-up assessme nts (Engle and Macgowan 2009; Currier et al. 2007; Rosner et al. 2010), which are key to determining how effective an intervention is in the long-term. Cost-benefit analyses have yet to be conducted, and these are particularly pressing for school anti-bullying programmes, given their widespread adoption (Farrington and Ttofi 2009). Finally, the views of participants have been noticeably absent for most of these studies, although they could be crucial in order to identify the effec tive components of interventions (McDaid et al. 2008).

Attachment and behavioural difficulties in children and young people In Great Britain, about one in ten children between the ages of 5 and 15 has a mental health problem; the most common being emotional disorders, hyperactivity, and conduct disorders (Meltzer et al. 2000). Behaviour problems in early childhood are often associated with negative, inconsistent parental behaviour, as well as high levels of family adversity (Campbell 1995). Emotional and behavioural problems in children are, then, common, and they can lead to mental health problems, such as depression (Barlow et al. 2010). Services in Northern Ireland A number of parenting programmes and home visiting interventions are designed to prevent behavioural difficulties among children and young people. Home visiting and parenting programmes The DHSSPS (2010) in Northern Ireland has acknowledged that 'Health visitors have a critical role to play in promotion of infant mental health (and) in early identification of poor bonding and attachment', and highlighted that 'attention should be prioritised to the impor tance of attachment, nurturing and emotionally attuned responsiveness' (p22). However, to date, there has been no evaluation of the impact of health visitors on attachment outcomes for infant s and children in Northern Ireland. In the South Eastern Trust, the New Parents' Partnership Programme is working with vulnerable groups of mothers to improve parenting. This programme has a particular focus on attachment. The Western Trust is providing the Nurse Family Partnership Programme (Olds 2006), a programme which has provided evidence of impressive effects in the three studies undertaken in the USA, and currently being evaluated in Great Britain (Barnes et al. 2006). Examples of parenting programmes include the Parenting Matters and Incredible Years programmes provided by Barnardo's, and NIACRO's Child and Parent Support (CAPS) programme, delivered to families whose children (aged 8 to 13) are at risk of anti-social and offending behaviour; or Da Young Fathers Project in the Western HSC Trust. Some of these programmes are being monitored through feedback of parents and professionals. School-based programmes promoting pupils' emotional and social wellbeing Whole-school approaches to pupils' wellbeing are increasingly popular, and are recommended in a number of policy documents in Northern Ireland (e.g. Leavey et al. 2009). This type of approach engages students, teachers, parents, families and whole communities in the curriculum and the ethos and environment of the school. Two particular initiatives are being promoted. The Health Promoting Schools initiative (delivered by th e HSC Public Health Agency and supp orted by the DHSSPS and the Department of Education) 'aims to enable schools to provide an environment where the physical and mental wellbeing, health and safety of staff and pupils are supported, in partnership with family, community and external agencies' (HPA 2002). The Extended Schools Programme (ESP) is particularly targeted at schools in deprived and disadvantaged areas, and aims to help 64'foster the health, well-being and social inclusion of children and young people' by offering a diversity of activities such as sport, drama, art, ICT, and programmes for parents (ETI 2006). Results of the search The search strategy identified only two records, both of which were deemed relevant. A further three records were found as part of other searches, and a Google search identified two reports (grey literature) and one article. Of these eight ci tations, six met the inclusion criteria in Box 6. Two papers were excluded, and Table 6.3 sets out the reasons for their exclusion. Box 6: Inclusion criteria - interventions aimed at factors associated with poor mental health POPULATION: children and young people, parents and carers. INTERVENTION: any primary or secondary intervention aimed at preventing attachment and behavioural difficulties in children and young people. COMPARISON: any comparison OUTCOME: behaviour change, attachment Included reviews Table 6.1 sets out the characteristics of included reviews. Most are concerned with either school- based programmes or parenting programmes. One review focuses on parenting programmes for children in their first three years of life. Another looks at a broader range of preventive interventions for behavioural and emotional problems of children 8 years and younger. Three reviews focus on school-based interventions promoting pupils' mental wellbeing and social and emotional skills, and the sixth is a review of mental health promotion and preventive interventions, including interven tions for infants/toddlers and families, and school-based mental health promotion and prevention. Quality of reviews All reviews described the included studies, but onl y one included details of excluded studies, and just two explicitly discussed the identification and exclusion of duplicates. There were two meta-analyses presented in the reviews. See Table 6.2 for further information. 65Table 6.1: Systematic reviews of intervent ions aimed at preventing behavioural problems Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To review the effectiveness of school-based interventions aimed at promoting mental wellbeing amongst children in primary education Adi et al. 2007 31 studies: 15 RCTs 16 CCTs USA (23) Germany (3) Australia (2) Canada (1) UK (1) Netherlands (1) Children aged 4- 11 years in primary education School-based interventions aimed at promoting mental health Evidence favour long-term, multicomponent programmes by teachers trained to deliver a curriculum that focuses on mental health, emotional and social development and behaviour management and teacher-child relationships.

Some evidence has been found of the effectiveness of the universal Good Behaviour Game programme (i.e. a 'whole-of-school' two-year approach to behaviour management) in reducing problem behaviour (i.e. aggression and conduct problems) (Adi et al. 2007; Bayer et al. 2009), but not depression (Adi et al. 2007). School-based universal SEL programmes (i.e. programmes promoting students' social and emotional development) have been found significantly to enhance pupils' behavioural adjustment, by increasing pro-social behaviours and reducing conduct problems (Durlak et al. 2011). These positive effects, despite some apparent 'wash out' in follow-up assessments, have been found to remain statistically significant for at least 6 months after the intervention (ibid). Thus, in general, it appears that 'comprehensive programmes that target multiple health outcomes in the context of a co-ordinated whole school approach are the most consistently effective strategy', in terms of producing long- term positive social and em otional outcomes fo r children and young people (Barry et al. 2009:6). Green et al. 's (2005) findings from their review of reviews would agree, in terms of long-term whole-school approaches promoting social and emotional health appearing to be more effective than brief class-based programmes aimed at preventing mental health difficulties. Although its efficiency has not been as clearly shown, peer-led approaches and mentoring programmes have been found to be potentially useful approaches (ibid). Selected and indicated programmes focused on reducing disruptive and aggressive behaviour appear to be more effective for high-risk children than for low-risk children (ibi d). Short-term conflict resolution programmes delivered by teachers and involving peer mediations have been shown to be effective in the short- term, but not in the long-term (Adi et al. 2007). This is not surprising, as it has been 67acknowledged that short-term interventions are unlikely to produce long-term effects (Barry et al. 2009). Home visiting programmes: Reviews have shown robust evidence of the effectiveness of home visiting programmes in reducing behavioural problems and improving child development, as well as improving parenting skills and maternal mental health (Barry et al. 2009). Within these programmes, programmes specifically focused on improving parental bonding and secure infant attachment have been shown to be effective in enhancing maternal sensitivity and infant attachment security (ibid). Early Start, a 2-3 year home visiting programme in New Zealand for at-risk and stressed mothers, and the two-year US-based Nurse Home Visitation Programme, delivered to low-income, unmarried, first-time mothers, have been found to be particularly effective in reducing emotional (in the case of Early Start) and behavioural (in the case of the US programme) problems from infancy (Bayer et al. 2009). UK-based initiatives of family support services run by the voluntary sector, such as the Home-Start and Newpin (New Parent Infant Network), have been replicated in other countries, and evaluations have demonstrated positive effects on mothers and volunteers, but to-date no long-term outcomes have been identified (Barry et al. 2009). A US brief targeted family support programme (the US Family Check Up), offering individually at home or community centres to moth ers of toddlers, has been identified as effective in reducing child behaviour problems. Group-based parenting programmes: Group-based parenting programmes aimed at improving the emotional and behavioural adjustment of children aged up to 4 years appear to be effective in the short-term, but there is a lack of follow-up da ta available that would help establish their long- term effectiveness (Barlow et al. 2010). There are certain programmes that appear to be effective in preventing and reducing behavioural and emotional problems in young children, which are the Triple P Positive Parenting programme and the Incredible Years Series (Barry et al. 2009; Bayer et al. 2009). Another group-based parenting programme that appeared to be effective in reducing emotional problems was the Parent Education Programme, a three-month programme for parents with shy/inhibited pre-school children (Bayer et al. 2009). Implications for practice Preventing interventions should begin early, be kept in the long-term and target risk and protective factors (Barry et al. 2009). Findings of the reviews reported here suggest that school-based programmes should: adopt a whole school approach, which includes changes not only to the curriculum but also to the school environment, and involves parents and the local community; employ an integrated approach, i.e. use universal and targeted interventions, so the needs of all children in a school are addressed; be comprehensive, i.e. target multiple protective and risk factors rather than target single, topic-specific issues, and use a social competence approach, focusing on the promotion of competence skills and coping outcomes rather than the prevention of specific problems; use interactive methodologies that involve a more participatory approach for pupils; include opportunities to encourage the application of learned skills throughout a range of contexts outside the school, e.g. in the home; 68 be grounded on a strong theoretical base; use sustained interventions over multiple years, as these are more likely to cause long-term positive outcomes than once-off interventions would; involve high quality implementation, i.e. high level of engagement and cooperation from students, teachers and parents, high level of support from the school organisation and management, appropriate teacher training and provision of support resources, good quality of materials, and optimum general readiness of the school to implement the programme, and incorporate systematic evaluation methods, so that programmes are continuously improved, and the quality and quantity of implemen tation is periodically assessed (Barry et al. 2009). Building partnerships with parents is indispensable when promoting children's emotional and behavioural wellbeing. These partnerships are particularly vital when working with vulnerable children and families living in disadvantaged co mmunities. These are the families in most need of such programmes, although they are also the least likely to avail of them. That is why community-based initiatives should be encouraged, as they are more likely to reach high-risk families (Barry et al. 2009). Intensive home visiting and centre-based support should be provided, as there is evidence to suggest that this type of interventions are successful in improving resilience and competence in children and parents, helping prevent mental health problems (ibid). Particular well-established parenting programmes have been found to be effective, and one is already being delivered in Northern Ireland by Barnardo's: the Incredible Years programme. Evaluations here have also shown positive effects (McDaniel et al. 2010). The Triple P Parenting Programme is currently being offered in Scotland, in particular in the East Dunbartonshire Council, and in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Glasgow City Council (BBC 2010), where some evaluations ha ve been conducted that have shown positive outcomes (Burley et al. 2005). Some research should be conducted in to whether the Triple P Parenting Programme could actually offer some benefits in the Northern Irish context. Effective parenting programmes, and other preventive interventions, have been recommended to follow these principles: have properly trained staff that adhere to the programme content; provide out-of-hours sessions for working pare nts and on-site childcare, where possible; be sensitive to different cu ltures at-risk populations; have proven effective or/and cost-effective outcome data; agree with the participant's values, past experiences and perceived needs; be easy to understand; be simple to adapt into the organisation; be transferable to other contexts, and provide training and a help-desk (Giesen et al. 2007 - cited in Bayer et al. 2009: 706). 69Implications for research Parent training Future research needs to focus on whether or not reported gains associated with parent training programmes improve behaviour endur e over time, and generalise to other children or situations. To date, the evidence has little or nothing to say about whether or not parenting programmes are cost effective as a primary prevention programme, or are best suited to secondary prevention. In both areas, studies need to be larger and address a wider range of outcomes over a longer period of time. Given the evidence regarding the importance of the parent-infant relationship to future mental health and social adjustment, this should be a research priority. Home visiting The evidence base underpinning home visiting is mixed. The programme reporting the best results to date are those of the Nurse Family Partnership (Olds 2006), and this is currently being trialled in the UK, and introduced to Northern Ireland. The evidence base is persuasive, but the evidence rests on three studies, conducted in a policy context quite different to that of the UK, and about which some researchers have expressed some concerns, not least of all in the lack of access to the primary data. There is a scope for the rigorous evaluation of other forms of parenting support programmes, such as that being rolled out in the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. School based interventions Despite the number of reviews and studies exploring the effectiveness of school-based programmes and interventions, further research needs to be conducted, especially longitudinal designs and good quality CCTs in the UK to assess the impact of whole-school and targeted approaches (Adi et al. 2007; Barry et al. 2009). This kind of approach is especially vulnerable to 'policy fads', and there are already indications that such interventions may no longer be a political impera tive. Not to evaluate the potential of these interventions would represent a missed opportunity within the UK.

These reviews, and some of the interventions they cover, overlap with previous chapters, as parenting programmes, family support services, and school-based interventions are included. However, in the previous chapter, the focus was on their effectiveness in preventing behavioural and emotional difficulties among child ren and young people. Th is chapter focuses on the extent to which these interventions ar e specifically helping parents and carers. Support needs of carers Parents and carers often report high levels of stress and worry in dealing with their child's mental health needs and behaviour, and accessing services (Hoagwood et al. 2010). Their most commonly reported needs are for advice and emotional support (C4EO 2010), but evidence suggests that parental support needs actually di ffer for different groups of parents and carers (Ghate and Hazel 2002). Parenting programmes In recent policy documents, the UK government has underlined the key role of parenting programmes as a means to support parents and improve parenting (Kane et al. 2007). Parenting programmes are interventions that use a structured format to work with parents, often in groups, and that aim to improve parenting practices and family functioning. Evaluations of these interventions suggest that they can be effective in improving a number of outcomes for families and children, but that we currently know little about what factors make parenting programmes meaningful and helpful to parents (ibid). Some specific parenting programmes feature in both this and the previous chapter, namely: the Incredible Years and the Triple P Positive Parenting programmes. The Incredible Years Parents, Teachers and Children Training Series were developed in the USA by Carolyn Webster-Stratton. They aim to 't hwart and treat behavior problems when they first begin (infant/toddler through elementary school age) and to intervene in multiple areas through parent, teacher, and child training' (The Incredible Years, Inc. 2011). The programmes help parents and teachers provide children from birth to 12 years old with a robust emotional, social and academic foundation. The parent training intervention is a series of programs focused on strengthening parenting competencies and enhancing parents' involvement in children's school experiences, in order to reduce behavioura l problems (The Incredible Years, Inc. 2011). The Triple-P-Positive Parenting Pr ogramme was developed in Australia. It is a multi-level, parenting and family support strategy, delivered to parents of children from birth to age 16, individually or in groups. It aims to prevent behavioural, emotional and developmental problems in children by enhancing the knowledge, skills and confidence of parents, and addresses the differing needs of parents through its different levels (Triplep.net 2011). 72Both Triple P and Incredible Years are currently offered in different parts of the world. The context of parenting programmes in Northern Ireland has been addressed in the previous chapter (Chapter 6). Results of the search The search strategy identified 256 records, and a further 6 records were identified through a Google search. Of the 262 records, 248 were judged irrelevant as they were not concerned with interventions, did not focus on parents/carers of children and young people, or were book reviews. Of the remaining 14 records, 10 met the inclusion criteria listed in Box 7. Four papers were excluded and Table 7.3 sets out the reasons for their exclusion.

All decided the inclusion criteria for their reviews before underrating the work, provided information about the search strategy, and had double data extraction. Only three of the 10 included a meta-analysis. Three were Cochrane reviews (Tuner et al. 2007; Underdown et al. 2009; and Coren et al. 2011) and one was a review of qualita tive research (Kane et al. 2007).

For many parents, this is a non-stigmatising means of finding out key information. The evidence suggests that parenting programmes, such as Incredible Years (for parents of children with conduct problems), Triple P (adaptable to the families' needs), and Strengthening Families, Strengthening Communities (developed particularly for minority ethnic groups), can 76improve parent outcomes (e.g. mental wellbeing), and family relationships, as well as children's behaviour, as measured by self-report (C4EO 2010). In particular, the resu lts of a meta-analysis of Triple P Level 4 interventions (i.e. an intensive training programme of 8-10 sessions for parents of children with severe behavioural difficulties) concluded that these interventions were effective in improving the parenting styles and competence of parents, as measured by self-report (de Graaf et al. 2008). Another meta-analysis of Triple P also reported positive effects, in terms of reducing negative parenting (medium to large effects), and the effects continued up to 3 months after the intervention (Thomas and Zimmer-Gembeck 2007). In terms of programmes for parents of youth with disruptive and anxiety disorders, enhanced Parent Management Training (PMT) with a Problem-Solving Intervention (PPS) has been found to decrease parental depression and stress (Hoagwood et al. 2010). The Strategies to Enhance Positive Parenting (STEPP) programme for single mothers of youth aged 5-12 with ADHD has been shown to improve parent and family impairment and stress, although these effects were not long-term, and the Incredible Years Advance Parent training programme has been found to improve communication and problem-solving skills (ibid). Parents with a learning disability For parents with a learning disability, evaluations of parent training interventions suggest that it is possible to improve their care-giv ing, although the quality of evidence is moderate to low (Coren et al. 2011). Barlow et al. 's (2010) review suggests that these interventions were especially helpful when they incor porated specific skill assessment and training, using direct observational techniques and modelling. Programmes often incorporate home-based, individual parenting interventions, sometimes combined with weekly, small group meetings with a family service worker. Parents of children with mental health problems For parents whose children have mental health problems, the evidence base for family-led family support programmes has been described as thin by Hoagwood and colleagues (Hoagwood et al. 2010). These are programmes led by parents, providing advocacy, information and training. Most of the evaluations have taken place in the USA. Examples of these are: the Parent Empowerment Program - a 40-hour training programme for family support workers offering one-to-one support to parents of children with mental health problems; and the NAMI Visions for Tomorrow programme - a 12-session programme consisting of group workshops for primary carers of children with brain disorders. Evaluations of team-led parent support programmes have evidenced some positive effects on parental outcomes, such as self-efficacy and perceived social supports and skills (ibid). These programmes, predominantly delivered in group formats, were led by a clinician and family member team, and developed by researchers and/or clinical professionals. They often focused on providing emotional support, by fac ilitating shared experien ces, insights and peer support, as well as instructional support and advocacy. Ex amples include: the Vanderbilt Caregiver Empowerment programme, co-led by a parent advocate and a clinician, which consisted of an 11- hour parent training curriculum aimed at empowerin g parents and increasing their involvement in their child's mental health; or the Parent Connections programme, a 15-month family support and education programme for parents of children in treatment for serious emotional or behavioural disorders, which is co-delivered by parent pa rtners providing support through the phone and face- to-face, and mental health professionals providing three educational workshops with parent partners. 77Kane et al. (2007) suggested that there is a lack of qualitative studies looking at parents' perceptions of parenting programmes. From the four primary studies included in their review, they concluded that parents felt that parenting pr ogrammes helped them regain control and feel more able to cope, which in turn reduced their feelings of guilt and social isolation, and increased confidence in managing their behaviour. Programmes comprised: videotaped modelling parent training programme delivered by a therapist; parenting programme delivered by health visitors; home-school-linked parenting programme; and the Webster Stratton Parents and Children Series group parenting programme. Helping foster carers A review of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural interventions designed to help foster carers manage challenging behaviour identified only six trials (Turner et al. 2007). The studies were of poor quality, the results mixed, and the confidence intervals very wide. The authors concluded that in 2007, there was no evidence of the effectiveness of these interventions, though an update of this review will be published later this year (Turner et al. in press). Supporting fathers The review by Magill-Evans et al. (2006) identified a number of interventions that research suggests can improve fathers' interactions with their young children: pre-natal education about infant behaviour, delivered to fathers, and modelling of this behaviour with the newborn; observation of infant behaviour by both pare nts together during a structured physical examination of the child; enhanced fathers' participation in a Head St art programme with support group and father- child recreational activities; kangaroo care to their infant in NICU by both parents; and a discussion group for fathers of toddlers with father-child playtime (Magill-Evans et al. 2006). These interventions all involve active participation with or observation of the father's own child. School-based initiatives An evaluation of the effectiveness of full service extended schools (FSESs) in the UK found reported improvements in family stability and ch ildren's engagement with learning, as well as child behaviour, though no significant effects were found in terms of pupil attainment (C4EO 2010). FSESs provide a comprehensive range of services for the child and family, and generally serve areas of disadvantage. In Northern Ireland, there is also an Extended Schools programme (see Chapter 5). Some evidence of increased parental involvement and improved family relationships was found for a knowledge-sharing scheme piloted in three local authority areas in England. This aimed to inform schools how to help parents/carers improve their child's learning (C4EO 2010). Another initiative in schools in England was the Parent Support Adviser (PSA), aimed at parents of children at risk of developing behavioural/emotional problems, and consisting of face-to-face support for parents, with almost half of the work being one-to-one. An evaluation of the PSA pilot found a decrease in persistent absenteeism and an increase in parents' engagement with their child learning, as reported by school line managers (C4EO). Therapeutic approaches: Some clinician-led, family support treatments (e.g. CBT) have been found to be associated with improvements in parental mental health, reductions in parenting stress and intrusive thoughts, and improvements in parenting practices, efficacy and attitudes 78towards the child (Hoagwood et al. 2010). Psycho-education and parent-infant psychotherapy have been found to be effective in improving mother-infant interaction, decreasing parenting stress and mothers' depression, and reducing maternal intrusiveness and mother-infant conflict (Barlow et al. 2010). These interventions are tailored to mothers and babies or toddlers with problems such as faltering growth, attachment di fficulties and abusive parenting, and they are delivered by psychotherapists, focusing on the parent-child relationship, parental representations and practices (ibid). Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) (i.e. an individualised therapeutic intervention for caregivers and their children aged 4-7 with externalising behaviour) has been shown to be effective in improving parenting (as well as child's behaviour) (Thomas and Zimmer-Gembeck 2007). Infant massage: There is evidence that infant massage can improve mother-infant interaction, promote sleep and relaxation and reduce crying and stress (Underdown et al. 2009). Infant massage may also enhance father-child interactions (Magill-Evans et al. 2006). Not all babies like massage, however, and particularly in vulner able groups, would mer it careful assessment and monitoring. Implications for practice A comprehensive approach is essential to promoting the mental health of parents and infants during the child's first years of life, and to prevent parent and infant mental health problems (Barlow et al. 2010). It has been argued that adult me ntal health services do not pay enough attention to the needs of its users as parents. There is a need to ensure that CAMH Tier 2 and 3 services (with specialist expertise) are availabl e to assess and give therapeutic support to young children and their families, to promote positive parent-child relationships, and tackle attachment problems (ibid). Similarly, those responsible for adult patients who are parents need to understand the impact that this can have on their children, and provide support not only in terms of their mental ill health, but in their role as carers. There is some evidence that full service extended schools can be delivered at a low cost. This type of programme would merit further consideration and evaluation, since the most common needs of parents/carers appear to be advice and emotional support, which can be delivered through schools (C4EO 2010). Some of the ingredients so far identified as crucial for effectively supporting families are: a 'joined-up' multi-agency approach; having a well-trained workforce; using media to engage hard-to-reach people, and using both practical and therapeutic interventions simultaneously. C4EO 2010: 2 Within Northern Ireland, parenting programmes targeted at young mothers from deprived backgrounds, as well as intensive home visiting by health visitors and school nurses to families with complex and challenging need, have been recommended by NIAMH (Leavey et al. 2009). Implications for research Some well-established parenting programmes and other family-oriented therapeutic approaches have been found to be effective not only in improving outcomes for children, but also in helping parents/carers cope with their caring re sponsibilities and improve their parenting and 79relationships with their children. However, rigorous evaluations of most interventions are uncommon (C4EO 2010), and more research is needed: i) to establish what programmes are best suited to support parents and carers from a diversity of backgrounds and different experiences, especially in the long-term (e.g. Coren et al. 2011; de Graaf et al. 2008; Hoagwood et al. 2010); and ii) to determine the differential impact of interventions with mothers and fathers (Magill- Evans et al. 2006). More cost-effectiveness studies are also needed, especially in the current economic climate (C4EO 2010).

As will be evidence from the chapter, the evidence base is generally weak, both in its breadth and its quality. Partly by way of underlining the significan ce of the gap in this area, we take some time to review the extent and significance of need, a nd pinpoint issues that have been identified by those studying this issue, and which provide point ers to changes needed in practice and to the gaps in research. Worldwide, studies point to increased rates of physical, developmental, and mental health problems amongst children in care (particularly depression and ADHD) compared with their peers (see Meltzer et al. , 2003; Ford et al. 2007; Mooney et al. 2009). They underachieve educationally (Jackson and McPartlin, 2006). Consequently, their longer-term outcomes are worse than those of their peers. They are also at increased risk for teenage pregnancy, substance misuse, homelessness, unemployment, and imprisonment (Mather, 2010). These key needs (i.e. physical health, education, and mental health) must be addressed whilst in care if LACYP are to be given the opportunity to achieve their full potential in life. Many looked after children and young people have experienced abuse or neglect (DCSF 2009). Maltreatment can impact adversely on the main areas of children's development, resulting in neuro-developmental difficulties, poor cognitive development, insecure attachment, impaired social competencies and low self-efficacy (Turney and Tanner 2003). Maltreatment is often associated with disadvantage, poverty and poor parental mental health, factors that might also increase risk for a wide variety of health problems amongst looked after children. Physical Health Rodrigues et al. (2004) surveyed LACYP and found that their general health care was well below statutory requirement, echoing earlier research by Hill and Watkins (2002), who found that, although assessments were being done, almost half of recommendations that followed were not acted on. They observed that failure to protect and promote the health of LACYP can cause more, rather than less, suffering . They also commented that a large body of research highlights the high level of health neglect and unhealthy lifestyles that are typical of children and young people living in public care. In order to effectively address the diverse needs of LACYP, they recommended that appropriately skilled professionals deliver health assessment, which should involve clinical diagnostic, health promotion, sexual health and mental health advice, and access to computer and paper health records (see also Stanley et al. 2004). Mather's (2010) study indicated that, compared with children of the same age and social status who live with birth parents, LACYP continue to be more likely to have incomplete immunisations, lower health surveillance, worse dent al health, poorer nutrition, and to make unhealthier lifestyle choices. Mental Health From their detailed review of the literature, Hannon et al. (2010) conclude that emotional and behavioural problems are strongly associated with placement breakdown. 84Placement instability can then ex acerbate any mental health diff iculty being ex perienced by the child or young person. They argue that LACYP need high quality emotional and professional support and stable placements from the outset, to address these problems and develop their resilience. In terms of improving current provision for LACYP, they recommended: Making mental health assessments of LA CYP entering the care system mandatory, applying a standardised multi-disciplinary measure (targeted at the DfE); incorporating mental health training in the training standards for foster and residential care workers (targeted at Children's Workforce Development Council); and Primary Care Trusts to commission on-site CAMHS support for LACYP in residential care and residential staff. Whilst there is increasing consensus around the concept of 'teaming up' of organisations to provide adequate services for children, the remit of specialist Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is not clearly defined, and this can be made worse by poor communication between health and social services (Hill and Mather 2003). Further, although the presence of behavioural problems may not require contact with specialist mental health services, a large proportion of these children will have concurrent mental health problems (Rao et al. 2010), pointing to the need for clearly specified and agreed care pathways. Rao et al. (2010) point out that one of the markers envisaged by the National Service Framework Children, Young People and Maternity Services (DoH 2004) and New Horizons (DoH 2009) health policies in England was that the needs of children with complex, severe and persistent behavioural and mental health problems would be met through an interagency approach. This would span the tiered system, w ith specialist multi-disciplinary mental health teams offering a service for the more severe, complex and/or persistent mental health problems. The policies recommend that Tier 2-3 mental health services should work in tandem with other agencies to enhance child mental health and well-being, and focus on attachment difficulties, through enhanced support and training for frontline practitioners. Although most new services appeared to follow the tiered model, there was marked variation in their operational criteria, staff constitution and therapeutic roles. Rao et al. (2010) also noted that, although many children experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, the distinction between 'mental health', 'well-being', 'problems', and 'disorders' was ofte n not clearly specified. This was a particular problem for broad, heterogeneous, and prominent presentations, such as behavioural and attachment difficulties, where a range of agencies may be involved. Consequently, there is little consensus on where to position CAMHS within a comprehensive model of intervention for LACYP. Northern Ireland policy and service context VOYPIC (Voice of Young People in Care), an advocacy service for LACYP in Northern Ireland, commissioned Mullan and Fitzsimons (2006) to carry out a detailed literature review of the mental health of Looked After/Care Leavers in Northern Ireland as part of the CASPAR 3 project. The review identified a number of key issues for practice, namely: 3 The aim of the Caspar project is to produce an evidence base which will contribute to the development of a strategy to meet the mental health needs of Looked After Children/Care Leavers across Northern Ireland. 85 LACYP need to be listened to, and to have their views placed central to the development, planning and delivery of services; The mental health of LACYP should be understood and assessed within the context of their lives, with a holistic approach adopted that incorporates their full range of needs, from support to treatment; All carers and professionals who are involved in the lives of LACYP should have a shared understanding of need and assessment; Mental health services for LACYP should be structured in a way that is consistent with clear, agreed, and accepted standards, and facilitates co-ordination, integration and accessibility; Risk reducing and resilience enhancing activities can be taken on a daily basis to enhance the life chances of LACYP. These ought to be li nked to the Care Pathway Planning process; There is a gap in research, investment and services that disadvantage LACYP in Northern Ireland. Results of the search The search strategy identified 215 records. Of these, 145 were judged irrelevant, as they were not concerned with looked after children. Among these were: reviews of chapters in book; book reviews; systematic reviews of child medical conditions, such as chronic asthma and other life limiting conditions; and single studies of medical conditions. 21 publications were judged to be relevant and a further 10 reviews were identified through Google Scholar, giving a total of 31 publications considered in detail. Of the 31, just 3 met the inclusion criteria listed in Box 8. Table 8.4 provides the reasons for the exclus ion of the remaining 28 publications. Box 8: Inclusion criteria - models of service that provi de effective help to children looked after POPULATION: looked after children and young people INTERVENTION: any model of service that aims to provide timely and effective help to Looked After children, and/or which offers a proactive and comprehensive approach to the assessment of their physical, educational, and mental health needs COMPARISON: any comparison OUTCOME: improved outcomes in children's physical and mental health The three systematic reviews examined models of service (very loosely defined), aimed at delivering positive outcomes for looked after children and young people. No systematic reviews or meta-analyses were identified that dealt with the important issue of comprehensive and timely assessments of the physical and mental health needs of looked after children. A Cochrane review on this last issue is currently in preparation (Griffiths et al. in preparation). This review will examine the effectiveness of comprehensive paediatric health assessments of children in out of home care due to maltreatment. It will examine the effectiveness of these paediatric assessments in identifying the physical health, developmental, mental and behavioural problems that looked after children might face (or present), and facilitating access to appropriate interventions. This highlights the need for systematic review/s of single study investigations/interventions/or evaluations in this area. 86Table 8.1 sets out the characteristics of included reviews. Two systematic reviews (Macdonald and Turner 2008; and Holtan and Valentine 2009) examine specific models of foster care (Treatment Foster Care and Kinship Care); the third (Everson-Hock et al. 2009) is concerned with training (for foster carers/professionals/volunteers), as a means of improving outcomes for children. Quality of reviews All three reviews scored highly on the AMSTAR rating system for systematic reviews, which would increase confidence in the conclusions reached in relation to the findings presented (see Table 8.2).

In the UK, we tend to use the term 'family and friends care'. In Australia, the term 'kith and kin care' is commonplace. Arrangements can be formal or informal. When a child in care is placed with family or friends, it is a formal arrangement. Winocur et al. 's (2009) review focuses on formal kinship foster care placements, with comparisons made with non-kinship (or 'stranger') foster care. The review examined 62 quasi-experimental studies, and the authors were able to conduct meta-analyses fo r 16 of the 28 outcomes they examined. Most meta-analyses involved only a handful of studies, as these were heterogeneous, not always well conducted, and often reported data in ways that did not lend themselves to synthesis. Of particular importance is the fact that children placed in kinship care are different to those entering non-kinship care, and this leads to a lack of confidence between groups and 'subsequent lack of control over contaminating events such as family preservation services' (Barth 2008: 218, cited in Winokur et al. 2009). Effect sizes were generally small to medium, and the authors caution that the data may have limited practical consequences. The review provides a careful analysis of the methodological weaknesses of research in this area, and is a good starting place for anyone designing a study in this field. 87Their general conclusions are that the evidence supports the use of kinship care as a means of enhancing children's behavioural development and mental health functioning, and of improving placement stability. The evidence does not support its use as a means solely to increase permanency. Given the weight of available evidence, Winocur et al. (2009) conclude that children in kinship care do better than those in non-kinship foster care in relation to the following: behaviour problems; adaptive behaviour; psychiatric disorders; well-being, and placement stability and guardianship. However, the authors point out that there was no discernable difference between the groups with regard to reunification, length of stay, family relationships or educational attainment. What is more, they are less likely than those in non-kin care to achieve adoption or to use mental health services and are more likely to re-enter out-of-home care or have a disrupted placement. The authors caution that 'these conclusions are tempered by the pronounced methodological and design weaknesses of the included studies and particularly the absence of conclusive evidence of the comparability of groups. It is clear that researchers and practitioners must do better to mitigate the biases that cloud the study of kinship care.' They conclude the following: i) Whilst a viable option, policies mandating ki nship care for children removed from the home for maltreatment may not always be in the best interest of children and families. Professional judgement is required on a case by case basis. ii) A key consideration is whether kinship placements would be more effective with increased levels of support from social workers and therapeutic services (Green 2000). The authors note that the costs involved need to be weighed against the independence desired by some kin carers. iii) Policy-makers need to decide whether or not kinship carers should be approved (like foster carers) and whether they should be provided with financial resources (these issues have been 'live' for some time in the UK). iv) In contrast to iii), kinship care may be a cost-effective alternative to foster care, given that children appear to do comparably well on wellbeing and permanency outcomes, with lower payments and fewer services. Treatment foster care Treatment foster care (TFC) is a foster family-based intervention that aims to provide young people (and, where appropriate, their biological or adoptive families) with an individually tailored programme designed to help bring about positive changes in their lives (Bereika 1992; Clark 1993). Because it is an individually tailor ed programme, TFC is sufficiently flexible to accommodate different client populations with a wide range of clinical problems and shifting community needs (Clark 1993). TFC was de signed specifically to cater for the needs of children whose difficulties or circumstances place them at risk of multiple placements, and/or more restrictive placements, such as hospital or secure residential or youth just ice settings (Webb 1988). These groups include children who have experienced trauma, neglect or abandonment; children and 88adolescents with mental health problems; children with problems of antisocial behaviour and offending; and children with serious medical conditions (Davis 1984; Foster 1982). Macdonald and Turner (2008) undertook a systema tic review of five RCTs of Treatment Foster Care (TFC). All studies were conducted in the US A. Since the publication of this review, a pilot of Treatment Foster Care has been conducted in England (Biehal et al. 2010). The study would not have met the inclusion criteria for this revi ew. The study recruited only 24 young people to the TFC group and comparison group, and was undermined by a number of other methodological (not an RCT) and practical problems (difficulties in identifying a comparison group sufficiently similar to those in the intervention group), making conclusions difficult to draw. Other studies are being conducted in Sweden but none appear to be outcome evaluations. A qualitative study of 28 foster carers in Sweden provides evidence to suggest that foster carers value the 24 hour access to the 'treatment tools' and a treatment team, that form part of the TFC package (Westermark et al. 2006). This appreciation was held irrespective of how they viewed the task of foster care, i.e. as a more or less professional job. Macdonald and Turner concluded that TFC may be a useful intervention for hard-to-place children and young people in terms of finding them a family setting. Results indicated clinically significant reductions in: anti-social behaviour; the number of days spent running away from placement; the number of clinical referrals; and the duration spent in locked settings. There were also improvements in educational and employment outcomes, particularly in terms of school attendance, homework, and finding work. The authors thought the quality of the evidence was generally fair, and improving, but that certain aspects of study quality are poorly reported, leaving many of the judgements about qualit y resting on unpublished information that was provided by study authors. General Training and Support The need for improvements in training and support for foster carers has been recognised for some time (Golding 2002), as well as for residential care staff (Walton 1995). The review undertaken by Everson-Hock and her colleagues (2009) aimed to 'identify and synthesise evidence that evalua tes the effectiveness of additional training and support to approved carers, professionals and volunteers involved in the care of or working directly/indirectly with LACYP on the physical and emotional he alth and well-being of LACYP' (p. 5). The authors identified eight studies, six of which were conducted in the US, and all but two of which examined very different interventions, although all studies compared training with and without support. The two American studies both combined: i) training aimed at helping foster carers reinterpret children's difficult behaviour; ii) training on how to overcome the personal barriers to providing nurturing care; and iii) training to help carers provide an environment to help children develop self-regulatory processes (Dozier et al. 2006; and Sprang 2008). The remaining studies each focused on one kind of training. Everson-Hock et al. (2009) report that in the two UK stud ies included in their review, foster carer training had limited impact on problem behaviour; in contrast, the US studies reported statistically significant benefits to looked af ter children and young people (LACYP) on this particular outcome. They commented that it was unclear whether this difference was due to differences in the type of training, or differences between UK and US fostering services. They observe that US 89Table 8.3: Reviews of models of services that provide effective help for looked after children. Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To identify and synthesise evidence that evaluates the effectiveness of additional training and support provided to carers, professional, and volunteers involved in the care of Looked After Children and Young People (LACYP), specifically in relation to their physical and emotional health, and well-being. Everson-Hock et al. 2009 8 studies: 5 RCTs 1 prospective cohort study 2 non-comparative studies USA (3) UK (6) Carers, professionals, and volunteers involved in the care of LACYP. Although not specified, it is assumed that this refers to children and young people under 18 years Training and support provided to carers, professionals, volunteers, and birth parents involved in the care of LACYP, to enhance their skills. Training programmes in the UK may need to be of longer duration and greater intensity than currently is the case, and there is a need to re-evaluate the impact of such programmes on LACYP of all ages. Refresher training or support may be needed for short- duration courses. Foster carers (and other professionals) recognize the need for, and values of, training and support. To evaluate the effect of kinship care placement on the safety, permanency, and well-being of children removed from home as a result of maltreatment. Winocur et al 2009 62 quasi- experimental studies USA (57) Norway (1) Israel (1) Sweden (1) Holland (1) Australia (1) Children and youth under the age of 18 who were removed from home for abuse, neglect, or other maltreatment, and placed in kinship foster care. Formal kinship placement, irrespective of whether the caregivers were paid or unpaid. The review supported the practice of treating kinship care as a viable placement option for children removed from home as a result of maltreatment. However, this conclusion is tempered by the methodological and design weakness that they identified in the studies that were included in the review. To assess the impact of Treatment Foster Care (TFC) on psychosocial and behavioural outcomes, delinquency, placement stability, and discharge status for Looked After children and adolescents Macdonald and Turner 2008 5 RCTs USA (5) Children and young people up to 18 years Multi-dimensional intervention Additional supports to foster carers Fostering Individualised Assistance Programme (FIAP) TFC is a promising intervention for children and young people at risk of being placed in settings that place restrictions on their liberty, and who are at risk of a range of adverse outcomes. This is particularly the case for those with conduct disorders and delinquency. 90studies tended to recruit carers of very young children, whereas the UK studies recruited a broader range, including carers of children and adolescents. Consequently, as there is a greater likelihood of placement breakdown or behavioural problems in older LACYP, the LACYP included in the UK studies would have been more likely to have serious behavioural problems at the outset. They only found one study (Macdonald and Turner, 2005) that measured the impact of training and support for foster carers on pl acement stability, and this found no significant differences between foster carers who completed training and those who did not, in relation to unplanned placement breakdowns. Everson-Hock et al. (2009) postulate that one possible explanation for this finding is that short-duration group training for foster carers is not sufficiently intense to impact on this outcome. A nother possibility suggested is that the training may have led to increased confidence in the carers, and this may have encouraged them to agree to further placements of more challenging LACYP. The study by Macdonald and Turner had a number of methodological shortcomings (mainly in reporting) that they thought might have changed the conclusions. Everson-Hock et al (2009) also presented the findings from four studies that examined the impact of training and support for foster carers on the emotional well-being of LACYP, with mixed results. Two UK studies did indicate that training for carers may have some benefit on LACYP's emotional well-being, although this was mo re likely if training was intense. Implications for practice Macdonald and Turner (2008) conclude that although the number of studies in this area is relatively few, diverse and small scale, the evidence suggests that TFC can be an effective social intervention for children and young people who are at risk of a range of adverse outcomes, in addition to being placed in a setting that restrict s their liberty. This is especially the case for children and young people with behavioural and emotional problems, particularly conduct disorders and delinquency. They also indicate that the research underlines the importance of ensuring that, for girls, TFC addresses the emotional and psychiatric conditions that frequently coincide with delinquency. There is indirect evidence that TFC leads to improved placement stability and other outcomes for children. This suggests that targeted selection, training, and support combines to improve the experiences of foster carers, and enhances their preparedness to foster these challenging children and young people. Based on the limited evidence from Everson-Hock et al. 's review (2009), UK training programmes for foster carers and others may need to be of longer duration and greater intensity, combined with ongoing support. There is also a need to re-evaluate the impact of these programmes for all ages. Where short-duration short coursed are provided (perhaps due to cost constraints or pressures on foster carer time), then some form of refresher training or support may be useful, for example post-training group discussion, leaflets, website, or telephone support. Kinship care is a viable option for some children, but not all (Holtan and Valentine 2009). Practitioners need to co nsider the levels of support provided to kinship carers, some of whom might need more financial support and other forms of advice and assistance. Foster care should continue to be an essential placement option. Children in non-kin foster care placements also experience positive outcomes, and appropriate kinship placements are not always obtainable or appropriate. Judgement is needed on a case by case basis. 91Implications for research In research terms, Holtan and Valentine (2009) highlight the need to mitigate the biases that are common place in the study of kinship care. There is a need for: longitudinal designs to investigate the outcomes for children over tim e; the development of psychometrically sound instruments of family and child functioning that enable more reliable comparisons between groups and studies; and greater focus on controlling and understandi ng selection bias, through the application of emerging statistical models. Macdonald and Turner (2008) suggest that further research should test the generalisability of findings from the studies included in their systematic review of Treatment Foster Care, by replicating the studies using independent research teams. Studies also need to be conducted in different locations, with different groups of young people, of different ages and increased ethnic diversity, with a range of clearly identified problem profiles, and with follow-up components greater than two years. Finally, the lack of any systematic reviews or me ta-analyses of the many multiple single study investigations of the physical, educational, and mental health needs of LACYP indicates a major deficit in this area, and we would recommend that systematic reviews of studies examining these needs be resourced, either in combination, or as a series of individual reviews.

The focus is, therefore, on interventions that aim to improve outcomes for children who have experienced maltreatment, rather than intervening to prevent abuse or to prevent its recurrence. The primary author of this chapter has a conflict of interest, in that she is responsible for one of the included reviews (Macdonald et al. 2010). Child maltreatment Child maltreatment encompasses physical abuse, physical neglect and sexual abuse. Emotional abuse or neglect can be separately identified, but is also a feature common across all other forms of maltreatment. Exposure to domestic violence is now recognised as a form of maltreatment in some jurisdictions. Prevalence A prevalence study of child maltreatment conducted in the UK by Cawson and her colleagues (Cawson et al. 2000) suggests that 7% of children are exposed to serious physical abuse from their parents or carers; 6% experience neglect ('serious absence of care'); 6% experience frequent and severe emotional maltreatment; and 5% experience serious lack of supervision; 11% of children experience sexual abuse by someone known to them but not related to them; 1% and 3% respectively are sexually abused by a carer or other relative, and 5% by someone unknown to them or someone they have just met. Incidence Table 9 provides information on the number of children registered on the child protection register on 31 st March 2009, or - in England - for whom a child protection plan was in place. Given the challenges of identifying child maltreatment, thes e numbers represent only the 'tip of an iceberg' in terms of the numbers of children maltreated (these are the only children deemed to have reached a threshold of 'significant harm' or 'risk of significant harm'). Table 9: Number of child protection registrations as at March 2009 England Wales Northern Ireland Scotland Total registrations as at 31 March 2009 34,100 2,512 2,488 2,682 Boys (as % of total) 51% 50% 50% 51% The numbers of children registered in each jurisdiction has increased steadily from 2002, with the largest increases occurring between 2008 and 2009, following the 'inquiry into the death of Baby P' in 2007 (Haringey LSCB 2008). Consequences of maltreatment Although rare, some children are deliberately killed by their carers (homicide) or die as a result of their neglect (manslaughter). 35% of child homicides (children under 16 years) are under one year of age (Brookman et al. 2006). Most children do not die, but their lives are often blighted by a range of adverse consequences of their experiences. In the short-term, children may sustain physical injury, and their health, education and general wellbeing may suffer. Kolko (1986) hypothesises that 96the effects of child physical abuse may impact upon a child's health in much the same way as spouse abuse has been shown to be correlated with poor health, and there is evidence that children who witness intimate partner violence are also prone to the adverse outcomes of maltreatment (Gelles and Straus 1990). Children who experience abuse and neglect fare noticeably less well in educational terms than their peers, and are more likely to be placed in special educational provision (Jonson-Ried et al. 2004; Boden et al. 2007). It is not clear if this association is caused by their abuse, or whether the abuse is - coincidentally - linked with other factors that might explain this association (e.g. having a parent who is poor or not interested in your education). Children who have suffered abuse and neglect are at increased risk of a range of mental health problems, including anxiety, depression (internalising problems) and behaviour problems, such as aggression or 'acting out' (Widom 1998; Fergusson et al. 2008). One third of children who have been maltreated meet the criteria for majo r depression by their late 20s (Widom et al. 2007). Physical and sexual abuse, neglect, emotional abuse, and the poor or disordered attachments that so often accompany them are all traumatic for children, many of whom respond with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (see Andres et al 2003; Widom et al. 1999). Physical and sexual abuse significantly increase attempted suicide in early adulthood, even when other variables are controlled for (Fergusson et al. 2008). The same is not true for neglect. Results of the search The search strategy identified 385 records, of which one was an 'erratum' to another. Of these, 329 were judged to be immediately irrelevant on the basis of their titles. The majority of these were related to medical and surgical issues , rather than mental health issues. Of the remaining 55 publications cited, 30 were judged irrelevant following closer inspection of their abstracts as they were not concerned with treatment. Amongst these were papers that focused on the diagnosis of abuse, the c onsequences of abuse, and the ro les of practitioners in caring for abused children or the impact of such work on practitioners themselves. Some citations comprised overviews of trauma research or books on trauma or victimisation. Of the remaining 25 records, 7 met the inclusion criteria listed in Box 8. Eighteen papers were excluded and Table 8.5 sets out the reasons for their exclusion. They include one review (Trask 2009) that was excluded not because it did not meet the inclusion criteria, but because it was updated in 2010. The 2010 review is included. Two additional re views were identified from the references of reviews found through the electronic searches (Hetzel-Riggin et al. 2007; and Skowron and Reinemann 2005). One review, known to the author of this chapter, was included when no reviews were found that had been published since 2005, and which dealt with attachment (Bakermans-Kranenberg et al. 2003). Box 9: Inclusion criteria - interventions addressing the support needs of carers POPULATION: children and adolescents with disrupted attachments and/or maltreated INTERVENTION: interventions to treat the consequences of maltreatment/disrupted attachments COMPARISON: any comparison OUTCOME: improvements in symptoms associated with maltreatment/attachment disorders 97Included reviews Table 9.1 sets out the characteristics of the ten included reviews. Six are solely concerned with child sexual abuse (Corcoran and Pillai 2006; Harvey and Taylor 2010; Hetzel-Riggin et al. 2007; Macdonald et al. 2010; Passarela et al. 2009 and Trask et al. 2011). One review dealt with psychosocial treatments for children and adolescents exposed to traumatic events (Silverman et al. 2008). The review by Louwers et al. (2010) was concerned to assess the effectiveness of screening interventions for child abuse by emergency room staff. Skowron and Reinemann (2005) conducted meta-analyses of psychological interventions for all forms of child maltreatment. The review by Bakermans-Kranenberg and her colleagues (2003) was a meta-analytic study of interventions to enhance parental sensitivity and infant attachment security.

It is not entirely clear whether the remaining 19 studies include any other RCTs 10 Impossible to reconcile reports of included studies in this paper. 99Quality of reviews Table 9.2 provides an overview of how these reviews were assessed against the AMSTAR domains. A fairly low threshold was operated here for 'was there an a priori design provided?' and 'Comprehensive search'. Most authors provided evidence that they had a plan for searching the literature and a (sometimes implicit) set of inclusion criteria, though few made this explicit or provided the components of a review protocol. It was not always clear whether or not authors had searched for unpublished studies. Exceptions were two reviews that followed the Cochrane Handbook (Macdonald et al. 2010 and Louwers et al. 2011). These were also the only review teams to address potential conflict of interest, though some authors did include their sources of funding. Review teams, particularly those covering interventions for children who have been sexually abused, took very different approaches to inclusion criteria for study designs, some including only RCTs or quasi randomised studies (Macdonald et al. 2010; Passarela et al. 2009), and others making the inclusion of a variety of study designs a virtue. However, with the exception of Macdonald et al. (2010), the quality of included studies, irrespective of study design, was rarely taken into account when formulating conclusions, although several author teams addressed study qu ality to some extent. Findings: Child sexual abuse Two reviews of interventions for children who have experienced sexual abuse set out to examine cognitive behavioural interventions (Macdonald et al. 2010; Passarela et al. 2010). Table 9.3: Authors conclusions - reviews of interventions to help children who have been sexually abused. Author/Year Interventions Authors' Conclusions Corcoran and Pillai 2006 CBT - focus on parental involvement Parent involved treatment confers some advantage over comparison conditions - usually child-only treatment. Harvey and Taylor 2010 CBT Insight oriented. Most treatments effective in symptom reduction. Presence of probable moderators of treatment outcome varied across symptom domains, reflecting importance of targeting therapy to individual needs. Hetzel-Riggin et al. 2007 CBT Treatment appears better than no treatment. Abuse-specific, supportive, and group therapy appear to me most effective for behaviour problems. CBT and individual therapy had largest effect sizes for psychological distress. Choice of therapy modality should depend on child's main presenting secondary problem. Further research needed to investigate other possible moderators and secondary problem outcomes. Macdonald et al. 2010 CBT Confirms CBT's potential as a me ans of addressing the adverse consequences of child sexual abuse, but highlights the tenuousness of the evidence base and the need for more carefully conducted and better reported trials. Passarela et al. 2009 CBT CBT reduces symptoms. No differences between therapy with only the victim or the victim plus a family member Trask et al. 2011 CBT Other Results revealed medium effect size s for externalizing and internalizing problems. Results indicated that longer interventions were associated with greater treatment gains while group and individual treatments were equally effective. 100The remaining four did not confine their inclusio n criteria to CBT, but all 7 of the studies in Corcoran and Pillai's review, around one third of the studies included in Trask et al. and Harvey and Taylor (13 of 35, and 11 of 38 respectively) were of CBT. It was difficult to categorise the studies from Hertzel-Riggins et al.'s review, but around half were assessing the impact of CBT, although these authors were most interested in moderator analyses. The heterogeneity in inclusion criteria across these reviews, and the variation in authors' attention to the risks of bias associated with included studies go some way to explain the differences in the reported results. Those with broader inclusion criteria are generally much more positive about the benefits of all therapy. Those focusing only on RCTs are generally more cautious. There are, however, some common themes that appear sufficiently well evidenced to use in the consideration of policy and practice. Firstly, children who are symptomatic (i.e. have one or more of the difficulties commonly associated with sexual abuse (PTSD, externalising behaviour, internalising behaviour)) appear to benefit from receiving therapy, and the weight of evidence favours cognitive-behavioural therapy, particularly that which addresses directly the sequelae of sexual abuse, so-called Trauma-Focus ed CBT. Secondly, both individual and group- based approaches can be useful. Thirdly, few studies have examined the impact of therapy on depression or sexualised behaviour, two common effects of sexual abuse. Findings: Child maltreatment Only two reviews were identified that considered intervention for child maltreatment more generally (see Table 8.4). One sought to identify effective interventions for use in emergency departments, to ensure that child maltreatment was accurately identified (Louwers et al. 2011). The authors found four studies that examined the impact of checklists, with or without training. Whilst cases of suspected abuse increased, there was no increase in confirmed cases in the two studies that reported these. Positive benefits as sociated with the interventions were improved documentation of patient files and staff awareness, but there is currently no evidence that interventions of this kind in this setting ar e effective at improving the detection rates of confirmed abuse. Table 9.4: Authors conclusions - reviews of interventions to help children who have been sexually abused. Author/Year Interventions Authors' Conclusions Skowron and Reinemann 2005 All treatments for all forms of Child Maltreatment (CM) Behavioural (12) Nonbehavioural (3) Eclectic/combination (5) Unspecified (1) Psychological treatments for CM resulted in improvements amongst intervention participants compared with wait-list control, placebo, or community case management. Treatment effects varied systematically by type, target and source of outcome construct, with parent- child- and parental ratings of child providing larger effects than behavioural observations. Treatments for child sexual abuse yielded larger effects than those more generally. Louwers et al. 2011 Checklist of indicators of risk for child abuse + education and training. Interventions improved documentation, increased staff awareness rates of suspected cases of child abuse in all studies. In two studies there was no increase in confirmed cases. 101The meta-analysis conducted by Skowron and Reinemann (2005) is complex, and it is difficult to extract helpful information about the kinds of trea tment that might help maltreated children. The authors conclude that children who received treatment were better off than 71% of those in any control group, though the strength of evidence was strongest (d + = .53) for self report measures (children and parents) and parental assessments of their children's progress. It was weakest for behavioural observations (d + = .21). Atypically, in this revi ew, nonbehavioural interventions outperformed behavioural ones, but post-hoc analyses indicated that length of treatment covaried significantly with theore tical orientation, with few behavioural treatments having been provided for more than three months, compared with an average of one year plus for nonbehavioural treatments. The authors recommend that studies be designed to explore whether treatment gains are an effect of length rather than theoretical orientation. Given that this review searched for all studies with at least a control group, published between 1974 and 2000, a significant finding is the dearth of research in this area generally. This has not changed significantly in the last te n years (Sheldon and Macdonald 2010) . Overall, the meta- analysis by Skowron and Reinemann (2005) appears to have rather more to say about the gaps in research, and what is needed of quality research in this field (see below). Findings: post-traumatic stress The remaining two studies looked at the evidence for the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions for posttraumatic stress (s ee Table 8.5). The review by Silverman et al. included four of the studies of interventions for child sexual abuse that formed part of the reviews discussed above, and seven of those reviewed by Skowron and Reinemann (2005). In addition, they included studies of treatments for children who had experienced a wide range of traumas, including - but not restricted to - maltreatment. The authors undertook a more rigorous evaluation of the methodological quality of the individual studies, and (see Nathan and Gorman 2002) classified treatments in respect of whether they were 'well established', 'probably efficacious', Trauma-Focused CBT met the 'well established criteria'; that school based CBT met the criteria for 'probably efficacious'; and that - from a clinical practice perspective - the best evidenced treatment for traumatised youth is CBT - specifically as described and implemented in the studies included in their (and earlier) reviews: Trauma-specific core components that have emerged in the practices considered well- established, probably efficacious, and possibly efficacious include components highlighted for many years in the child trauma literature. These core components include psychoeducation, the management of anxiety, trauma and loss reminders, trauma narration and organization, cognitive and affective labeling and processing, problem solving regarding safety and relationships, parent skillbuilding and behavioral management, emotional regulation, and supporting youth to resume negatively impacted developmental competencies (Amaya-Jackson and DeRosa 2007) (Silveman et al. 2008: 177). 102Author/Year Interventions Authors' Conclusions Silverman et al. 2008 Trauma Focused CBT School based Group CBT EMDR Resilient Peer Treatment Cognitive Processing Therapy CBT for single incident PTSD TF-CBT met the well-established criteria for efficacy. School-based CBT met the criteria for 'probably efficacious'. Several others interventions were categorized as 'possibly efficacious'. Attachment and mat ernal sensitivity We identified no reviews pub lished since 2005 that dealt with interventions specifically to address attachment problems in maltreating and high risk families. A meta-analytic study by Cyr and colleagues (2010) provides unequivocal evidence of the 'destructive impact of maltreatment for attachme nt security as well as disorganisation', whilst at the same time, pointing out the impact posed to children in high ri sk families, defined as families with one or more of the following: low income, substance misuse, adolescent mothers, minority ethnic group, low educational achievement, single parenthood: In particular, maltreated children are less likely to develop secure attachments and more likely to develop disorganized attachments compared to nonmaltreated children living in high-risk conditions. However, disorganization is also more likely to emerge in children exposed to the cumulative impact of socioeconomic risks. In fact, children exposed to five risks are almost as likely as maltreated children to become disorganized. This is not the case for attachment security: maltreated children are less likely to develop a secure attachment pattern than children exposed to five risk indicators (Cyr et al. 2010: 100). Attachment insecurity is also strongly a ssociated with externalizing behaviours, as evidenced in a meta-analytic study by Fearon et al. (2010): Drawing from data on nearly 6,000 children tested in standardized observational assessments of mother-child attachment security, the average effect size for the contrast between secure and insecure children was d = 0.31 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.40). Over 1,700 studies of average sample size with null results would need to be added to the database to reduce this effect to nonsignificance. For clinical samples, the average effect size amounted to d = 0.49 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.66). On the face of it, these robust findings lend direct support to the notion th at attachment plays a significant role in the evolution of children's behavior problems, for typically developing children as well as for clinical groups (Fearon et al. 2010: 448). Given the importance of this area, we therefore summarise the results of a meta-analysis conducted in 2003 by Bakermans-Kranenberg and her colleagues. In their meta-analysis of interventions designed to enhance carer sensitivity and promote attachment, Bakermans- Kranenburg et al. (2003) identified 81 studies that met thei r inclusion criteria, 51 of which were randomized controlled trials. The measures used included assessments of caregiver sensitivity and ratings of attachment security. Interventions were categorized according to whether they were designed to improve sensitivity (see Black and Teti 1997), to bring about changes in carers' mental representations (see Cicchetti et al. 2000), or to provide social support and practical help in changing behaviour (Barnett et al. 1987), or a combination of these. Maternal sensitivity The review authors concluded that interventions targeting maternal sensitivity produced a significant, albeit moderate effect when measured statistically. Based on the randomized controlled trials, they concluded that interventions focusi ng only on sensitive 103maternal behaviour (compared with those also pr oviding 'support') appear 'rather successful' in improving sensitive parenting, as well as infant attachment insecurity. The most effective interventions were those which: incorporated video feedback; started after the child was 6 months old; were short (interventio ns with fewer than five sessions were as effective as those with 5 to 16 sessions, and more effective than those longer than 16 sessions); were provided by non-professionals, and involved fathers (though they note that this association should be viewed with caution as there were few studies and these were not randomized controlled trials). Infant attachment When looking at the impact of interven tions on infant attachment, a similar pattern of findings emerged from the 23 randomized controlled trials that measured this outcome: The impact on attachment security was statistically small but significant. Interventions aiming only at enhancing sensitivit y were the only interventions that indicated a statistically significant effect on attachment security. By and large, these improvements were achieved irrespective of socio-economic status. High-risk families The authors went on to examine the effectiveness of interventions with families with multiple risks. They hypothesized that these families would need more intensive and multifaceted interventions. In fact, from the 15 relevant studies, the findings echoed those reported above. The most effective interventions were those that focused on sensitivity, started at age 6 months, used video feedback, and were behaviourally based. Relationship between sensitivity and infant attachment security The authors also concluded that the only interventions that yielded a significant effect size on attachment security were those that also brought about significant shifts in sensitivity, measured statistically. As may be seen from a perusal of the studies included in the review by Bakermans-Kranenburg and her colleagues, attachment interventions vary considerably in design, their conceptual assumptions, and the goals of therapy. Most entail: providing a safe and supportive environment; helping the carer to 'tune' into her child; to be physically acce ssible (perhaps by sitting on the floor with him or her); and to be emotionally responsive (perhaps via play). There is often an element of information sharing or education, but this is only one small element in the most effective interventions. As indi cated above, one of the most powerful mechanisms for change appears to be the chance to learn by doing, to receive feedback (via video), and to have an opportunity to reflect on that feedback with a supportive person. Home visiting is widely recognised as a promising intervention, but the only programme that has reported a positive impact on maltreatment is that of Old's Nurse Family Partnership. We have not included reviews of home visiting in this chapter, partly because it is aimed at preventing maltreatment. However, the UK is currently evalua ting the impact of NFP across 50+ sites in the UK, and early results are promising. However, this programme targets one group of parents at risk for maltreatment, and there is a need to develop and test programmes targeted at other vulnerable groups. The New Parents Project in the South Eastern Trust is one example of a 104'home grown' programme, tailored to meet the NI policy context, and which targets a wider group of parents who are vulnerable to poor att achment, inadequate parenting and maltreatment. Implications for practice The paucity of services available for children who have suffered maltreatment at the hands of their carers is routinely commented upon in the child maltreatment literature. The focus in the UK has been on the identification of maltreatment and the assessment of risk. Only recently have policy makers realised the opportunity costs of not addressing the infant and child mental health issues associated with maltreatment. Currently, service development for those children traumatised or otherwise adversely affected by maltreatment remains seriously underdeveloped, both in terms of availability, and the degree to wh ich services are evidence based, as opposed to reflecting the theoretical or practice preferences of clinicians. The evidence suggests that some service may be better than none, but that interventions based on the learning theories, particularly cognitive-behavioural therapies, enjoy the strongest evidence base, particularly for children who have been sexually abused or who are experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress. In relation to attachment difficulties, there are poin ters to the kinds of inte rventions that research indicates are most likely to improve infant-mot her attachment and parental sensitivity. Again, effective interventions are those that draw on social learning theory. Gaps in research Whilst there are now more studies in the area of maltreatment than there were, they remain few in number and are focused predominantly on dealing with the sequelae of child sexual abuse. Addressing the trauma of children who have experienced physical abuse is much less common. That associated with neglect is barely addressed at all. Given the long-term adverse consequences of maltreatment, this is a significant research gap. Whilst co-occurrence of forms of maltreatment is the rule, rather than the norm, it is not evident that interventions focused primarily on the sequelae of child sexual abuse can be generalised to physical abuse and neglect, or to psychological maltreatment. Significantly, more research is needed in all of these areas, including sexual abuse. Whilst there is a larger evidence base in relati on to promoting parental sensitivity and infant- parent attachment, there is room for more research, particularly in relation to interventions that single studies indicate are promising, but have yet to be extensively or rigorously evaluated (e.g. Mellow parents/Mellow Babies, which did not feature in the Bakermans-Kranenberg review). Gaps in research therefore include: the need i) for studies of interventions designed to address the sequaelae of child physical abuse and severe neglect, and psychological/emotional maltreatment; and ii) studies of interventions that are designed to prevent maltreatment in high-risk populations not covered by the Nurse Family Partnership. More generally, there is a need for studies that: use more robust, experimental designs; provide better baseline information, including assessments of presenting problems and types of maltreatment, participants, interventions, settings, contact with other agencies, etc.; 105 provide information on co-occurrence of other types of abuse, which are commonplace, in order to enable conclusions to be drawn about the differential effectiveness of interventions for specific forms of maltreatment; track and report client attrition rates, reason s for attrition, obtain follow-up data on all participants; use a multidimensional approach to the assessment of outcomes that include behavioural observations, and collect data and conduct studies of process, to assess the quality of the therapeutic alliance and other key change events. 106Table 9.5: Excluded Studies - Interventions for Child Maltreatment Study Reasons for Exclusion Adler-Nevo and Manassis 2005 Systematic review focused on single incident trauma.

So too is the importance of multi-agency working: different services may be involved with children and families as a result of distinct referral processes, but organisational boundaries ar tificially segregate problems (e.g. parental ill health may be 'owned' by adult mental health services, but its impact on parenting is the responsibility of children's social services). Wh at we know less well is how to bring about effective team-work, at least from the point of view of an evidence base that has been explicitly concerned with children's mental health services. There is, of course, a large literature on organisational and inter-organisational behaviour, but that was outside of the scope of this review. Here, we were concerned specifically to identify reviews of studies that examined the effectiveness of interventions designed to improv e multidisciplinary and multi-agency working in relation to child and adolescent mental health. Results of the search The search strategy identified 288 records. Of these, 242 were judged to be immediately irrelevant on the basis of their titles. The majority of these papers were disregarded, as they were related to medical and surgical issues, rather than mental health issues. Of the remaining 46 publications cited, 39 were deemed irrelevant following closer inspection of their abstracts. These papers were either not reviews of interventions or multidisciplinary / interagency practice, were reviews of multidisciplinary working but not focused on children and young people with mental health problems, or were not reviews at all. Seven papers were obtained in full. Five were excluded for reasons given in table 10.4. Two Cochrane reviews (both updates published in 2009) were potentially relevant, but the focus of the interventions in one led us to exclude it (See Table 10.4). We include the other, but make only brie f reference to it, as it deals with the more generalisable interventions of interprofessional education, and the focus of the studies was not directly relevant to this review. Given the paucity of available evidence, and the doubtful gene ralisability of findings from multidisciplinary or multi-agency in terventions in other areas of health, we present evidence from an earlier 'review of reviews', and discuss some single studies. None of these were identified systematically, and the pool of single studies or non systematic reviews will be much larger. On the positive side, the themes have remained remarkably consistent, which may be a reason both to be relatively confident that these papers repres ent the current state of knowledge, and relatively depressed - in equal measure. Box 10: Inclusion criteria - evaluations of multi-agency or multi-disciplinary teams/interventions POPULATION: children and adolescents with mental ill health INTERVENTION: multi-agency or multi-disciplinary teams/models of practice COMPARISON: any comparison OUTCOME: improvements in outcomes (childr en, young people, families) and service delivery. 110Included studies The only systematic review published since 2005 was a Cochrane review of the effectiveness of interprofessional education (Zwarenstein et al. 2009). A description of this review can be found in Table 10.1, but in light of the need to rely on earlier reviews and single studies, we have chosen to discuss this review in the next section. This review was rated 'Yes' on all AMSTAR domains, except for those relating to the synt hesis of data, where the answers were 'Not applicable'. Table 10.1 Characteristics of included studies - multi-agency/multidisciplinary working.

A review of reviews In 2004, Patricia Sloper published a review of re views relevant to multi-ag ency working as part of the evidence gathering to inform the Children's National Service Framework in England. We use Sloper's review as the basis for a wider discussion of the evidence base. Sloper is clear about her search strategy, which was conducted in 2002 and sought to identify systematic reviews and 'good quality reviews' (not defined), published in English since 1989. The search covered a number of databases such as those covered in this report, and was not confined to multi-agency work on children's services 'as it was felt that more general literature of multiagency working would be relevant' (p572). Despite the approach to the search strategy, Sloper's review meets none of the criteria for a systematic review. For example, little stock is taken either of the quality of the reviews included , or the quality of their included studies (though the latter is more often referenced). However, it is a 'cool' summary of research, which - as indicated above - is generally in tune with other reviews and the findings of single studies. Again, the primary author of this chapter has a co nflict of interest, insofar as she was an author on one of the key reviews that forms part of Sloper's paper (Cameron et al. 2000; 2003). 111The questions Sloper sought to address were: i) What models of multi-agency working are utilized in practice? ii) What evidence is there that multi-agency working improves outcomes for service users? iii) What evidence is there about the factors that facilitate co-ordinated multi-agency working? iv) What evidence is there on the barriers to co-ordin ated multi-agency working? Most of the published literature addresses the last two questions. We begin by reviewing the evidence for the impact of different approaches to multi-agency working and interventions to promote multi-agency working - a relatively short section. Does multi-agency working improve outcomes for children? The systematic review conducted to Cochrane standards by Cameron et al. (2000), concluded that there was little quality evidence on the effectiveness of multi-agency working from the perspective changes in either the experience of services for service users, or their outcomes. A later review, focusing on keyworker systems for disabled children, points to a trend in the literature (rather than high quality data) that su ggests that having one point of contact with someone mandated to coordinate services, improves families' perceived quality of life, delivers better relationships with services, and better and quicker access to them. Th is in turn results in reduced stress (Liabo et al. 2001). The only other review cited by Sloper that report ed on outcomes for services users examined team working (Borrill et al. 2002a). The review authors concluded that multi-disciplinary team working resulted (or could result) in reductions in hospitalisation and associated costs, improvements in service provision, detection, treatment and follow-up. In a separate study, Borrill et al. (2002b) examined the work of more than 400 teams in primary care, community mental health and secondary care. They concluded that team working was associated with improved outcomes for service users (and reductions in stress amongst staff). Outcomes included in the review were: sexual health, substance misuse, access to consultations with GPs and other health professionals, use of out-of-hours services, length of GP consultations, non attendance and patient experience surveys (Sloper 2004: 575). What factors facilitate multi-agency working? Sloper included three studies that examined th is issue, one being the systematic review by Cameron et al. (2000), the others a study by Atkinson and colleagues (2002), and a review by Watson and colleagues (2000, 2002). She provides a list of those factors that these authors identified as associated with successful multi-agency working: Clear and realistic aims and objectives, which are understood and accepted by all agencies; Clearly defined roles and responsibilities, so everyone knows what is expected of them and others, and clear lines of re sponsibility and accountability; Commitment of both senior and frontline staff, which is aided by involvement of frontline staff in development of policies; Strong leadership and a multi-agency steering or management group; An agreed timetable for implementation of changes and an incremental approach to change; 112 Linking projects into other planning and decision-making processes, and Ensuring good systems of communication at all levels, with information sharing and adequate IT systems. According to the studies examined, the implementation and ongoing management of the service requires: Shared and adequate resources, including administrative support and protected time for staff to undertake joint working activities; Recruitment of staff with the right experience knowledge and approach; Joint training and team building; Appropriate support and supervision for staff; and Monitoring and evaluation of the service, with policies and procedures reviewed regularly in the light of changing circumstances and new knowledge. (Sloper 2004: 575-6) What are the barriers to co-ordinated multi-agency working? Clearly, an absence of 'any of the above' conspires to upset plans for closer working between agencies and those working within them. The review teams whose work was included in Sloper's review also identified some ad ditional factors that got in th e way of multi-agency working, namely: Constant reorganization; Frequent staff turnover; Lack of qualified staff; Financial uncertainty and difficulties in main taining new arrangements, once the initial funding came to an end (this was often short-term 'pump priming' or 'pilot' funding; once finished, it was also difficult to secure an equitable commitment from partner agencies); and Different professional ideologies and agency cultures. Cameron et al. (2000) note that a few studies found that lack of coterminosity of agency boundaries hindered joint working, but Sloper observes that this was not a consistent finding across studies. Identifying what impedes multi-agency working is easier than identifying what works in removing the obstacles. A review by Lyne et al. (2001) found little empirical evidence that would provide the basis for planning, other than a suggestion that shared learning may be effective in reducing interprofessional stereotypes. As Sloper points out, however, there is no evidence that interprofessional education or training brings about any changes in the experience of service users. A Cochrane review identified by Sloper (Zwarenstein et al 2002) found no studies that met minimum eligibility, although 89 papers were considered. The authors conducted a second review of qualitative studies of interprofessional education (IPE - Koppel et al. 2001) and examined the evidence from 99 studies, though most were classed as being of weak designs leading to weak evidence. The authors concluded: IPE may be more effective at improving patient care or changing the organization of care if it is of longer duration, delivered in the workplace, and more specifically in the acute sector (Koppell et al: 47). 113Change was, however, only evidenced at the level of continuing professional education. Box 10a provides a categorisation of models of multi-agency working. We do not discuss this, as we have not found any evidence that one model is intrinsically better than another at achieving the changes required in delivering effective multi-agency working. There are also other classifications (see Watson et al. 2000; 2002). As Sl oper observed in 2004, there is no evidence regarding which models are in fact in use, or their effects on outcomes for children and families. Sloper points out that only case management aims to ensure that services are 'coordinated at the point of delivery to children and families'. BOX 10a Models of multi-agency working. Sloper citing Cameron et al. (2000) and Atkinson et al. (2002) Strategic level working - joint planning, decision-making, commissioning, purchasing. Consultation and training - where professionals from one agency provide consultation or training for those from another agency. The majority of these involved health professionals passing on knowledge to other professionals. Placement schemes - involving establishing posts which crossed the organizational divide, e.g. social workers working within primary health care. Holders of these posts usually acted as care managers, but were not necessarily part of a clear multi-agency system. Centre based service delivery - where professionals from different agencies work together in one place, but do not necessarily deliver services jointly. Co-ordinated service delivery - where there is usually a co-ordinator to pull together different services, e.g. healthy schools initiative co-ordinator. In th is category, the co-ordinator operates between the strategic and operational levels, but delivery of services to children and families is still carried out by different professionals who may not have contact with each other, but do gain knowledge of other agencies' work through the co-ordinator. Multidisciplinary and multi-agency teams and projects where professionals from different agencies work together on a day-to-day basis as a multi-agency team. Case or care management within multi-agency teams where an identified individual has responsibility for ensuring a co-ordinated service to families. Atkinson et al. note that this was the least common model in their findings on services for children. More recent studies and reviews Interprofessional education The 2002 study of interprofessional education that Sloper included (Zwarensten et al.) was updated in 2009 (Reeves et al.), and the authors identified six studies that met their inclusion criteria: This updated review found six studies that me t the inclusion criteria, in contrast to our first review that found no eligible studies. Although these studies reported some positive outcomes, due to the small number of studies, the heterogeneity of interventions, and the methodological limitations, it is not possible to draw generalisable inferences about the key elements of IPE and its effectiveness (Reeves et al. 2009:4). The focus on the interventions was of limited relevance to this review, other than perhaps those seeking to improve interprofessional working in emergency departments (see below). Whilst generally conducted to a good standard, the au thors point out that all the studies shared a 114common, key limitation, namely that the control group received no education rather than uni- professional education. Few examined patient outcomes. Joining up services with IT Gannon-Leary and colleagues (2006) describe a national project to 'join up local services in England' - FAME (FrAmework for Multi-agency Environments). FAME was organised around the electronic exchange of information across agencies and professional boundaries in a specific service, and Gannon-Leary and colleagues report on Phase 1 - in which six local authorities led partnerships with service providers a nd IT suppliers. The six projects (or 'strands') covered a range of services, including an 'Integrated mental health' strand, and one on children with disabilities. The paper by Gannon-Leary and colleagues is orga nised around a review of the facilitators and barriers to partnership, and collaborative working identified in previous studies. The methodology for this review is not reported, and the paper itself introduces no new themes to those summarised by Sloper (2004), though more emphasis is placed on the role of IT, and the challenges of local authorities working with a gro up of providers more used to dealing with the private sector. The continuing challenges of establishing effective multi-agency working appear not to have abated in the description of these projects provided by the authors. On the particular issue of the role of IT, they conclude: It was often reiterated by all participants in FAME - including the technology partners - that FAME was not about IT but about people, organisations and culture. Yet the technical challenges proved more intractable than anticipated. These included difficulty negotiated existing suppliers, lower than expected levels of IT skills among practitioners, and lack of clarity about technical integration as an ambition. The presence of these challenges is an important message in the context of interprofessional care because IT solutions are becoming more central in many countries to policies targeted at modernising public services (Booz, Allen Hamilton 2005). Partnerships tasked with delivering more joined up services will increasingly need to manage environments that demand harnessing technology, in addition to getting relationships right (Gannon-Leary et al. 2006: 672). There was no focus on the impact of these initiative s for service users, other than from the point of view of practitioners. Improving team working and leadership in mental health services Steve Onyett and colleagues (2009) report the outcomes of intervention designed to improve team working in mental health services. The intervention comprised a seven day program, anchored in research on effective team working, and working with 14 mental health teams covering community, inpatient and primary care across different regions of the NHS in England. The authors report before and after measures of team working, team effectiveness, staff burnout, job satisfactio n and leadership style, together with data gathered fr om feedback questionnaires comp leted by participants at each session. It is not clear what the composition of each team was, but the profile of teams overall included psychiatry, clinical psychology, occupational therapy, social work, community psychiatric nursing, and a range of other professions. The authors report that the intervention affected improvements in all areas, although these did not reach statistical significance. As the measures indicate, there was no focus on patient outcomes. 115Responding to early onset mental disorders The deleterious effect of delay in responding promptly to early onset psychosis is well documented (see Drake et al. 2000; Nordentoft et al. 2002). Craig et al. (2004; 2006) undertook a randomis ed trial of a dedicated, multi-disciplinary community team established on the principles of assertive outreach, and using evidence-based psychosocial interventions. The intervention was designed to achieve better outcomes for people with early non-affective psychotic disorders, compared with existing services delivered by community mental health teams. Although not restricted to young people, the mean age of participants was 26 and the range 16 to 40 year s. Primary outcomes were rates of relapse and readmission to hospital. At 18 months, patients served by the Lambeth Early Onset Team (intervention) were less likely to relapse, were readmitted fewer times, and were less likely to drop out of the study compared with patients receiving standard care. One of the weaknesses in the study was the reliance on record systems for data on relapse but, as th e authors point out, the alternative is both costly and likely to increase rates of attrition amongst the control group. The authors report results across a number of measures of patients' symptoms, social functioning and satisfaction (Garety et al. 2006). Symptom improvement was not enhanced for those in the intervention group, compared with those receiving routine care, but the authors report significant improvement at 18 months in terms of satisfaction, quality of life, medication adherence, and some aspects of social and vocational function, such as regaining or establishing social relationships, time spent, vocational activity, and global functioning. For those in the intervention group, there were also fewer incidents of death prison homelessness and violence - but not self- harm, but as the authors point out, these are rare events and differences were not statistically significant. Whilst the results are promising, they probably sa y more about the content of practice than model of practice, i.e. both the intervention and control teams were multidisciplinary, but the intervention team had clear treatment protocols regarding the use of medication, cognitive behaviour therapy, and family support. The management of mental health emergencies One area that has received little attention is the response provided by hospitals and other agencies to children and young people presenting out of hours or in emergency departments. We found no systematic reviews of studies in this area. Baren and colleagues (2008) publishe d a non-systematic review of the literature 'to identify the epidemiology, barriers to care, useful emergency department (ED) screening methods, and resources regarding paediatric mental health disorders in the ED' (p399). This is a very anecdotal paper that relates to the very different policy context of the United States, but it does highlight the need for effective interventions to recognise, screen, and manage effectively those young people presenting with problems indicative of mental disorder or mental health risk (e.g. self-harm, poisoning, suicide attempts, and depression). This may be a significant gap in the evidence base, given the high rates of self-harm and suicide in Northern Ireland, and anecdotal evidence that young people are being missed or poorly served in emergency departments (see Irish News, 3 rd May 2011). Implications for practice. There is little in recent literature to add to the implications for practice from earlier work. The importance of multi-agency working with peers is intrinsically obvious , but we still know little 116about how best to deliver it. The challenge appears not to be in assembling the component parts, but in enabling them, or making them work. Most of the available evidence has therefore, not surprisingly, focused on the process of multi-ag ency working, w ith little attention having been given to the difference this might make to those in receipt of services, and those needing them but not getting them. Implications for research. Assessing the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of models of practice and service delivery is undoubtedly a challenging task, both in terms of developing study designs that minimise bias, and operationally. To date, research endeavour has over-invested in mapping and investigating (new) ways of working from the pe rspective of the barriers to, and facilitators of, success, judged from the perspective of participant professionals. There is therefore a need for rigorous studies, which look at the impact on practice, and more particularly on outcomes for those on the receiving end of services. Randomised trials are possible in this area, but controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series designs also provide opportunities for rigorous evaluations of professional practice and healthcare outcomes. Studies should include data collection strategies that shed light on the impacts of interventions, whether these are educational, organisational or focused on fostering good working relationships. It is likely that there is a gap in research on models of practice aimed particularly at mentally ill young people and specifically at emergency or out-of-hours responses to them. Services in Northern Ireland are generally geared towards adult psychiatric care, and young people's experiences of finding themselves in hospital settings with older, often very disturbed or disabled people can have iatrogenic effects.

Resilience Resilience has been defined as a 'dynamic pro cess encompassing positive adaptation within the context of significant adversity' (Luthar et al. 2000). An individual can experience adversity in various ways, including one-off events such as acts of violence, or continuous events, such as living with a parent diagnosed with depression. What is of interest is how some individuals react to the experience of such events with the development of their own psychopathological problems, while others appear remarkably 'resilient', and are able to carry on with limited difficulty. While it is difficult to identify a prevalence statistic for resilience in children, Tusaie (2004) has suggested that it could range from 15% to 50%, according to the population under investigation, and the definition of resilience used. It is noted that such a wide range in prevalence demonstrates its dynamic nature and the fact that it is strongly dependent on the context and environment. Previously, resilience was regarded as an internal characteristic or trait, but it is now generally accepted that it is a mainly dynamic process, which is a result of various different interactions between the child and the environment. The mechanisms by which some children adapt positively when exposed to adversity are a current focus of research, but some factors appear to be associated with pos itive outcomes. Vanderbilt (2008) high lighted three main areas in which such protective factors could be identified. These can be categorised as: Child Protective Factors (e.g. IQ, emotion regulation, temperament, coping strategies and genetic influences), Family Protective Factors (e.g. love, nurturance, safety, security, nutrition and shelter), and Community-level Protective Factors (e.g. neighbourhood quality and cohesion, youth community organisations, and the quality of the school environment). Similarly, Riley (2008) suggested that resilience can be adequately supported in children when they have supportive, responsive, and positive parenting, experience of positive activi ties and interactions, and exposure to positive adult models of problems solving. It is important to distinguish resilience fro m simple survival. While survivors can still be absorbed by victimization, resilience involves une xpected or markedly successful adaptation to negative life events, trauma and stress (Fraser et al. 1999). The topic of resilience, particularly in childhood, has been of considerable interest to researchers. Not only it can improve our general understanding of child development processes, but it may provide the basis for the design and implementation of interventions aimed at improving child outcomes (Masten 2001). Contextual Issues Masten (2001) highlighted two important contextual issues to be wary of regarding the concept of resilience. Firstly, there are different approaches regarding how to judge whether adaptation following adversity is sufficiently 'good' or 'positive'. While some use absence of 122psychopathology or low levels of symptoms as sufficient indicators, others rely on measures of whether the child has met the major expectations of society. A second significant contextual issue is the conflict regarding whether individuals can be considered resilient, if they have never faced a significant threat to th eir development, as by definition resilience supposedly requires a current or past hazard or risk with the potential to derail normal development. The difficulty here lies partly in the diverse ways in which a (potential) hazard or risk may be defined, ranging from socioeconomic status, specific trauma, low birth weight, divorce, and so forth. Consequently, there is a difficulty in comparing the concept across different studies, unless they all concern the same hazard or risk, and all use similar indicators or me asures of resilience. Interventions for the development of resilience The Bamford report noted that early intervention strategies should be regarded as an important means of preventing the development of problems throughout Northern Ireland (Bamford 2006). Whilst interventions have been implemented and assessed in the research literature, most target specific populations who have experienced specific adverse events, such as families experiencing parental depression (Riley 2008), children of sex workers and drug users (Beard 2010), children who have experienced neglect (Allin 2005) or maltreatment (Walsh 2010), and most commonly, children experiencing depression and anxiety (K avanagh 2009; Merry 2007). Interventions have addressed the ways in which these populations can develop or nurture their resilience following such events or experiences, most often, through family group therapy, problem solving and coping skills, cognitive behavioural techniques, and education. However, general preventative interventions, addressing genera l protective factors that may he lp to address positive adaptation should an adverse event arise, appear to be lacking. Northern Ireland Context Bamford (2006) highlighted that schools in Northern Ireland have made a significant effort to promote resilience and sociability in young people, as part of the positive promotion of mental health, and recommended that further activities such as Circle Time, Circle of Friends, Nurture Groups, anti-bullying programs, and the teaching of emotional sk ills could be used (Bamford 2006; see also discussion of NI Anti-bullying Form in Chapter 5). However, since the publication of the Bamford report, there appears to be limited evidence available regarding the implementation and assessment of such proactive, preventative strategies. The search strategy The search strategy identified 83 records. Of the 83 publications cited, 66 were judged irrelevant, as it was immediately obvious they were either not systematic reviews or they were not concerned with treatment or interventions. Am ongst these were papers that focused on the general importance of resilience in mental health , and the consequences of failure to adequate develop or nurture resilience, yet with no reference to specific interventions. Of the remaining 17 records, 6 met the inclusion criteria listed in Box 11. Eleven papers were excluded, and Table 11.4 sets out the reasons for their exclusion. 123BOX 11: Inclusion criteria - interventions to promote/nurture the development of resilience POPULATION: children and young people, under the age of 18. INTERVENTION: any form of intervention that addresses the promotion or nurturing of the development of resilience. COMPARISON: management as usual, placebo intervention, no intervention. OUTCOME: any measure of mental health (anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts/attempts, etc.) Included reviews Table 11.1 sets out the characteristics of included reviews. None of the included studies focus solely on the development of resilience, but rather on interventions targeting adverse events (including depression, anxiety, and maltreatment), only some of which incorporate the development of resilience. Five of the six reviews were concerned with addressing depression, and anxiety in young people, with only one addressing treatment following child neglect or maltreatment. Within these reviews, it is only the included interventions that make specific reference to resilience th at will be reported on. Quality of reviews Table 11.2 provides an overview of how each of the included reviews scored on the AMSTAR criteria. Overall, the quality profile of all six reviews was mixed. Three of the six failed to state whether two or more people independently conducted the search and undertook data extraction. There is, of course, a possibility that this practise was followed but not reported, though we think this unlikely. Three of the six reviews also did not attempt to search beyond peer review published literature, and none of reviews conducted any form of formal assessment for publication bias. Only one of the included reviews provided details of both included and excluded studies. All but one of the six studies ma de an assessment of the quality of the included studies. However, the one that did not report doing so (Merry and Spence 2007) was an update of a previously conducted Cochrane Review not includ ed in this report as it was beyond the cut off point of 2005 (Merry and Spence, 2004). It is possible that, in this update, the authors adhered to the quality assessment guidelines outlined in the original 2004 review. Most reviews combined their findings appropriately, though only one unde rtook a full meta-analysis, with a further three providing effect sizes only, together with their reasons for not conducting a formal meta-analysis. 124Table 11.1: Systematic reviews of int erventions for promoting/nurturing resilience Author/Year Objective Number and type of study included Setting (no. of trials) Participants Allin et al. 2005 To review the effectiveness of child neglect treatment interventions. 5 studies 4 RCT (1 of which relevant to resilience) 1 prospective cohort USA (1) Socially withdrawn African American children exposed to physical abuse, physical neglect, or both.

This program is based on cognitive behavioural theories of depression, and aims to assist the participant to adapt positively to the adverse event, in this case, depression. A total of six trials assessing th e effectiveness of this intervention were included across the five reviews of depression and/or anxiety in young people. Often, there was overlap with the specific trials included in each reviews, but while the review authors were consistent in their reporting of the ov erall effects for the intervention, they often drew differing conclusions on the implications of their findings. The review by Calear and Christensen (2010) was focused on school based interventions for children aged 5-12 year, published between 1998 and March 2009. The review included 42 eligible studies, only 5 of which were specifically related to resilience. The results of these five studies all concerned the Penn Resiliency program (PRP). The PRP is described by the programme developers as follows: '..a group intervention for late elementary and middle school students. The curriculum teaches cognitive-behavioral and social problem-solving skills and is based in part on cognitive-behavioral theories of depression by Aaron Beck, Albert Ellis, and Martin Seligman (Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale, 1978; Beck, 1967, 1976; Ellis, 1962). Central to PRP is Ellis' Adversity-Consequen ces-Beliefs (ABC) model, the notion that our beliefs about events mediate their impact on our emotions and behavior. Through this model, students learn to detect inaccurate thoughts, to evaluate the accuracy of those thoughts, and to challenge negative beliefs by considering alternative interpretations. PRP also teaches a variety of strategies that can be used for solving problems and coping with 126difficult situations and emotions. Students le arn techniques for assertiveness, negotiation, decision-making, social problem-solving, and relaxation. The skills taught in the program can be applied to many contexts of life, including relationships with peers and family members as well as achievement in academics or other activities. (http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/prpsum.htm ) The review conducted by Merry and Spence (2007) was designed to update information on prevention and early intervention programmes for depression in children and adolescents aged 5-19. The search was restricted to studies published after the publication of their original Cochrane Review and up to the end of July 2006. This explains the more limited number of trials included in the review (n=9). Three of the nine were directly relevant to the topic of resiliency (Seligman et al. 1999; Yu and Seligman 2002; Puskar et al. 2003; and Gilham et al. 2006). One of these was also included in the review by Calear and Christensen (Gilham et al. 2006). An interesting point to note is that Calear and Christensen used the Gilham et al. trial to highlight the finding that trials using teacher program leaders appear to produce smaller effects than trials using mental health professionals or programme developers. In contrast, Merry and Spence drew attention to this trial, citing the results as small and inconsistent, due to the fact that the intervention did not appear to reduce depression, but did prevent depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders when these appeared combined, though only in high symptom populations (the whole sample was already designated 'high-risk'). Consequently, each of these two reviews highlights different priority areas and implications for practice. Merry and Spence conclude that, although much of the research and intervention focus is on enhancing protective skills, this would be best complemented by broader efforts to improve the child's environment, and thus reduce the initial occurrence of adverse events. Calear and Christensen (2010) highlight the Penn Resiliency Program as an example of a 'consistently effective program' that program developers should look to, in order to identify elements of a program that are 'engaging and producing the desired effects'. When considering the quality of these two reviews, it should be noted that the re view by Calear and Christensen appears slightly superior in its overall methodological rigour. The results from the two reviews by Neil and Christensen (2007; 2009) are best considered together, as while there is slight variation between the focus of the two reviews, there is considerable overlap between the topics under investigation and subsequent results, with 12 of the 51 included trials appearing in both reviews. The earlier review by Neil and Christensen (2007) focused only on programs developed or trialled in Australia that aimed to address symptoms of anxiety or depression or increase student resilience. The later review (Neil and Christensen, 2009) focused on interventions that aimed to build resilience, or reduce symptoms of anxiety, but no t depression. In addition, this second review did not restrict interventions to only those developed or trialled in Australia. Although the inclusion criteria for the 2007 review se arch strategy stipulated that interventions must address symptoms of anxiety or depression, or increase student resilience, none of the included trials make any specific reference to resilience. The 2009 review was slightly clearer, in that it was stated that of the 27 studies included, 6 focused on 'building resilience'. However, it is still not specified to which 6 they are referring, with the exception of one of the 27 included trials, the trial assessing the effectiveness of the Penn Resiliency Program. This was previ ously included in the results of both Calear and Christensen (2010), and Merry and Spence (2007). Consequently, while the inclusion criteria for these two reviews would su ggest that these interventions may relate to the 127topic of resilience, we cannot identify exactly whic h included trials are relevant to the topic. All than can be identified is the overall effect of these interventions on anxiety and depression only. Therefore, it is difficult to apply with confidence the overall findings of these reviews to the topic of resilience. Table 11.3: Authors conclusions - reviews of interventions for promoting/nurturing resilience Author/Year Interventions (no. of trials) Authors' Conclusions Allin et al. 2005 Dyadic pairing with resilient peer play buddy for play sessions (5) Both maltreated and non maltreated children benefitted from resilient peer treatment (decreased solitary play and increased positive interactive peer play) Calear and Christensen 2010 Penn Resiliency Program (6) Five of the six studies indicated significant difference in depression scores following intervention (effect sizes ranged from 0.27 to 1.05) Studies differed on whether a significant effect was present at a 3, 6, 12, or 24 month follow-up. The only study to fail to indicate a significant difference following intervention was conducted on African American children. Kavanagh et al. 2009 Penn Resiliency Program (3) Penn Optimism Program (1) Only two of the meta-analyses were based exclusively on trials relevant to resilience. These pooled results indicate: Interventions provided outside of school hours were ineffective at reducing depression (SMD = -0.19 (CI= -0.42, 0.03)) Interventions including were effective (SMD= -0.31 (CI= -0.54, -0.07)) Merry and Spence 2007 Program (CBT) (1) The Gatehouse Project (\"Whole school\" approach to Health Promotion) (1) Penn Resiliency Program prevented depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders when combined in high symptom participants. The Gatehouse Project did not reduce depression, but reduced substance abuse. Neil and Christensen 2007 The 24 trials were described as pertaining to 9 specific interventions, which made use of: CBT Interpersonal Therapy Psycho-education It was not clear which interventions used which approach. Short to midterm, small to moderate significant reductions in: Anxiety (effect sizes ranged from 0.24 to 1.36) Depression (effect sizes ranged from 0.21 to 0.96) Authors have suggested many of the trials were underpowered, indicating that outcomes may be more positive than findings suggest. Neil and Christensen 2009 CBT (19) Psycho-education + CBT (2) Relaxation (2) Exercise (1) Communication skills (1) Social skills training + psychoeducation + exposure (1) Social learning + modelling (1) 21 of 27 trials reported significant improvement in symptoms of anxiety 17 found improvement at post-test (effect sizes ranged from 0.11 to 1.37) 4 found significant improvement at follow-up (effect sizes ranged from 0.22 to 0.81) Authors attribute the range in effect sizes to variations in the conduct of the program, including program fidelity, leader characteristics and audience characteristics. Overall, despite some positive results, the review au thors are reluctant to place any firm reliance on their findings, citing the low methodological quality of many of the included trials and lack of randomised controlled trials, as limit ations to be addressed in future research. Further, as the 2007 review focused only on studies that had been developed or trialled in Australia, it is questionable how generalisable these results may be. 128Kavanagh et al. (2009) addressed whether secondary school based mental health promotion interventions based on cognitive be havioural techniques were effec tive in preventing or alleviating depression, anxiety and suicidality in young people. While this review was the only one to include a series of meta-analyses, only two of meta-analyse s from this review are relevant to the topic of resilience and each meta-analysis pooled results from the Penn Resiliency Program with the results from the fourth intervention re levant to resilience in this re view, the Penn Optimism Program. These results therefore can only be considered apart from the other narrative syntheses. Based on these meta-analyses, the data suggest that thes e interventions work best for high socioeconomic participants, but these results are extremely tentativ e, considering only two tr ials were included in this meta-analysis, and would require much more detailed exploration before any firm conclusions were drawn. The only included reviews that did not focus on depression or anxiety was Allin et al. (2005), exploring the effectiveness of Resi lient Peer Treatment for children exposed to physical abuse or neglect. The results of this trial were very promisin g, leading authors of this review to highlight this intervention in their own discussion, suggesting that the use of peers may produce a more powerful effect than the use of therapists. Such a possibility wo uld do well to be explored further, as it could identify a potentially low-cost, highly effective method of developing resilience in young populations. Implications research Building on the results of the included reviews, some possible research priorities for this area may include the following: 1. Due to its consistent inclusion across all of the studies concerning depression and anxiety, further examination of the effe ctiveness of the Penn Resilienc y Programme and its applicability in a variety of settings, in more high quality, randomised controlled trials would be particularly beneficial to this area of research. 2. Because the variability in effect sizes has been attributed to variability in the conduct of the programmes, future research should explore which aspects of the programme are most supportive to the programme, and which should be controlled to ensure highest levels of efficacy. 3. The possibility that the effects of intervention s may vary according to individual differences, including cultural differences and socio-economic status is also an area of interest that should be explored further. 4. As noted, none of the included reviews focused solely on the development of resilience per se (understandably problematic), but focused on interventions targeting depression, anxiety, and maltreatment, only some of which incorporate the development of resilience. Interventions with a clearer focus on increasing or nurturing resilience should be a research priority, for, as demonstrated, resilience can have wide ranging effects on different aspects of childhood development, and interventions that successfully address this issue could have wide potential for implementation. This may not be possible until we have a better understa nding of the nature of resilience. 5. An interesting possibility was ra ised regarding the use of peers for resilience training, with suggestions that such strategies may be more effective than the use of professionals or 129practitioners. This could have significant impli cations for practice and should be incorporated further into future intervention strategies. Maki ng use of the influence of peers rather than professionals is an increasingly commonplace strategy in Northern Ireland. This is most evident through the use of Mentoring Schemes, available through organisations including Opportunity Youth. Such strategies would benefit from high quality assessment and development.

Mental Health and Gay, Lesbian, Bi sexual and Transgendered People There is a noticeable gap in research regarding the mental health of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people. Some have attributed this to the historically somewhat fraught relationship between sexual minorities and psychiatrists, as a result of the previous misconception that any behaviour or attitude that differed from the majority was considered a mental disorder. This was compounded by the various attempts to use behaviour therapy to 'reorient' the sexuality of gay men and to lesser extent gay women in the 1960s and 1970s (King and Bartlett 1999). Although the American Psychiatric Association's Board of Di rectors voted that homosexuality should be removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1973 (Herek and Garnets 2007), the stigma has perhaps never fully been eradicated. The recent interest in the mental health of this population is now concerned with the effect that the prejudice, discrimination and stigma attached to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people can have on mental health. Prevalence In studies of adult populations, research had indicated that there is a considerable difference between homosexual and heterosexual men for any mental health disorder, most notably anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts or atte mpts (Lewis 2009). Some studies suggest that gay and bisexual men are 3 times more likely to meet the criteria for major depression and 4.7 times more likely to meet the criteria for a panic disorder than their heterosexual peers (Cochran et al. 2003). Research on female sexual minoriti es is perhaps less widely available than that of male sexual minorities, but here too there is evidence of a si gnificant problem, with lesbian or bisexual women 3.9 times more likely to demonstrate generalized anxiety disorder (Cochran et al. 2003). Further research from Clements-Nolle et al. (2001) indicates that the increased risk of mental ill health appears equally high in transgender populations, with 62% of male to female transgender individuals, and 55% of female to male transgender individuals classified as depressed. Furthermore, 32% of male to female and 32% female to male transgender individuals had attempted suicide. A similar prevalence rate was identified by Maguen et al. (2005) who found 67% of their transgender participants reported problems with anxiety and depressions. Despite a growing number of studies exploring thes e issues in adult populations, the attention paid to adolescent populations is less developed, with studies being few in number, and methodologically limited. Convenience sampling is a common technique in this type of research. Van Heerington and Vincke (2000) found that homosexual and bisexual young people were significantly more likely to report suicide ideation than heterosexual young people. However, their study was notably flawed in that their population of homosexual and bisexual youths was recruited almost entirely from a holiday 132camp for homosexual and bisexual youngsters, subjecting this study to high amounts of bias and poor generalisability. Much of the current research with young people took place more than 15 years ago (Remafedi et al. 1991; Hershberger and D'Augelli 1995). Further, some research claiming to assess 'mental health' in this population focuses solely on the behavioural consequences of mental health, such as suicide, alcohol dependence, and truancy (Lewis 2009). This is important, and recording behaviour may be a more objective and reliable process than recording psychological processes, but the latter are also important and research should not ignore other areas of mental health, including depression and self-esteem. Minority Stress The most commonly accepted explanation for the high prevalence of mental health problems in this population is that sexual minorities are regularly subjected to stigma, discrimination and prejudice, creating a highly stressful social environment, which leads to mental health problems. This is a common experience of members of minority groups, and consequently is often referred to as Minority Stress (Meyer 2003). With specific relation to LGBT people, three processes of minority stress have been suggested. These range from objective processes such as external experiences and conditions, (e.g. violence and discrimination), to perceived stigma, causing anxiety, vigilance and subsequently stress, and finally, subjective processes of internalized homophobia, where the person directs societies negative attitudes towards themselves (Meyer 1995). Interventions and Strategies With such high rates of depression and suicide, the development and implementation of appropriate interventions to ameliorate the mental health problems of this population is clearly a priority. Some tentative suggestions have been made regarding possible strategies. For example, it has been suggested that alliances need to be made between schools and agencies that serve adolescents, in order to prevent the possible impact of discrimination and consequent isolation (Roberts 2006). Some of the research tends to focus purely on 'recommendations' for clinicians, regarding the optimum way in which to create an appropriate environment for these young people, to reduce stigma and discrimination in a professional environment. Recommendations include encouraging good communication, ensuring all team members do not inadvertently offend the young people or crest barriers, ensuring confidentiality and promot ing sensitivity (Levine 2009). Yet, there is little documented evidence regarding practical implementation and assessment of such strategies. Another possibility suggested is that, rather than targeting the subsequent mental health problems of the population, attention should be paid to preventative strategies, addressing the initial stigma and discrimination. This could be achieved by including information on homosexuality into school sex education policies, as recommending by the Britis h Medical Association (1997). Some research has suggested that, through a variety of intervention strategies such educational interventions aimed as dispelling myths and prejudices, it may be po ssible to change heterosexual attitudes to homosexuals, which could reduce the initial occurrence of minority stress (Tucker and Potocky 2006). 133Northern Ireland Context There are a number of organisations within Northern Ireland, aimed at providing support and promoting the health and well-being of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, including Gay and Lesbian Youth Northern Ireland (GLYNI), Gay and Lesbian Across Down (GLAD), and the Rainbow Project. The Rainbow project has produced important statistics regarding the mental health of gay and bisexual men in Northern Ireland. A recent report by this organisation has indicated that 30.7% of the respondents had self-harmed at least once, and 16.3% admitted to feeling depressed when they thought of their sexual orientation (McNamee 2006). The most notable piece of research to have taken place in Northern Ireland in recent years was the shOUT report (2003). This research examined the needs of young people in Northern Ireland who identified as lesbian, gay bisexual and/or transgender. This research was particularly important as it not only provided essential, up to date informat ion regarding the needs of this population, but also highlighted the various methods by which professionals and organisations may be able to help. This research indicated that lesbian, gay, bisexual and/or transgender young people were at least 3 times more likely to attempt suicide, 2.5 times more li kely to self-harm, and 5 times more likely to be medicated for depression. While this report concluded with various essential recommendations for actions to be taken by different departments and organisations, there appear s to be little available research regarding the implementation and evaluation of such recommenda tions. A review of the available research since the publication of this report in particular would be useful to identify what has effectively been done, and what areas remain to be addressed. The search The search strategy identified 94 records. Of these, 85 were judged irrelevant, as it was immediately obvious they were either not syst ematic reviews or they were not concerned with treatments or interventions. Amongst these were papers that focused on interventions reducing sexual risk behaviours and sexually transmitted infections, and HIV. These were ineligible as the focus was on physical, rather than mental health. Many studies we re also ineligible due to their focus on adult populations, rather than adolescents. A further one review was identified through Google and Google Scholar keyword searches, and so a total of 10 were considered in further detail. Box 12 sets out the criteria by which studies were judged to be included or excluded. BOX 12: Inclusion criteria - review s of interventions to address the mental health needs of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender young people. POPULATION: children and young people, under the age of 25 who are identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or with gender identity disorder. INTERVENTION: any form of intervention addressing mental health issues. COMPARISON: management as usual, placebo intervention, no intervention, heterosexual control group. OUTCOME: any measure of mental health (anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts/attempts, etc.) 134Of the remaining 10 records, 2 met the inclusio n criteria (see Box 12.1). Eight papers were excluded and Table 12 sets out the reasons for their exclusion. Included reviews Table 12.2 sets out the characteristics of the two included reviews. Neither concerns transgender individuals. One review (Bouris et al. 2010) explores the parental a ttitudes and influences that can impact a young person's mental health, and the second (Tucker and Potocky-Tripodi 2006) examines an intervention aimed at changing the attitudes and views of heterosexual young people. While neither review is concerned with specific interventions aimed directly at young lesbian, gay or bisexual people, both examine external strategies that could alleviate the problems they face regarding stigma, discrimination and prejudice, thus impacting their subsequent mental health. Quality of reviews Table 12.1 provides an overview of how both included reviews scored on the AMSTAR criteria. Both seemed of a relatively low quality. Both prov ided sufficient information about their inclusion criteria and search strategies, and both list their included studies (but provide no information about those they excluded). Although neither explicitly stated whether there were two independent data extractors, this does not preclude the possibilit y that this practise was followed. Both reviews suffered a notable limitation in that no attempt was made to search beyond peer review published literature and nor was there any assessment of publication bias. Bouris et al. (2010) would have benefited from some form of assessment of the quality of the included studies. However, both studies urged caution in interpreting the results of their reviews due to the methodological limitations of the studies included within each review. Meta-analyse s were not presented in either review.

Bouris et al., 2010 Y N Y N N Y N C/A N/A N N Tucker and Potocky- Tripodi, 2006 Y N Y N N Y Y Y N/A N N Findings The most striking finding is the lack of evidence produced in this research area in the last five years. No reviews were identified that targeted interventions specifically aimed at the mental health of young gay lesbian, bisexual or transgender people. Most research in this area targets physical health and well-being, with particular emphasis on sexually transmitted diseases, HIV and AIDS. The only exceptions were two reviews focusing on interventions that might target the stigma and minority stress experienced by this population, with potentially adverse consequences for their mental health. 135In general, the findings of Tucker and Potocky-Tripodi (2006) suggest that interventions could, in principle, result in attitude change towards lesbian, gay, and bisexual young people. However, the authors of this review are reluctant to place any firm reliance on their findings, claiming that no intervention included in their review was adequately tested. Most notable among the methodological issues, was the questionable measurem ent tools used in the studies to assess anti- gay attitudes, the reliability and validity of which the review authors felt were not adequately reported. The authors suggest that if it is indeed poss ible to change attitudes in this way, it is most likely to be a cumulative effect, as a result of repeated exposure to consistent information that seems to be credible. Table 12.2: Systematic reviews of interventions to a ddress the mental health of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender young people. Author/Year Objective Number /type of study included Setting (no. of trials) Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions Bouris, et al. 2010 To review parental influences on the health and well-being of lesbian, gay and bisexual young people. Health areas included substance use, violence/victim ization, mental health, and suicide. 31 Studies 16 relevant to mental health 13 cross sectional 3 retrospectiv e US Canada New Zealand (1) US (7) Unknown (8) Homosexual males and females aged 13 to 29 years. Searched for parental influences as a correlate of one of 5 targeted health areas: Sexual risk behaviour Experience of violence/victimizati on Substance use Suicide Mental health A supportive and caring parent child relationship emerged as an important correlate across studies. Two important dimensions of parenting appeared in the overall pattern of results (i) parental knowledge and response to child's sexual orientation, and (ii) emotional qualities of parent-child relationship Negative parental responses are inversely associated with young people's mental well- being. Tucker and Potocky- Tripodi 2006 To review interventions that aim to improve heterosexuals' attitudes towards homosexuals. 17 studies 4 RCT 13 CCTs All studies conducted within USA Undergraduate and post- graduate students from schools in USA aged 18-35 years. Most interventions were based on one or a combination of: Cognitive and/or education approach (dispelling myths and stereotypes) Contact theory (increased exposure and shared experiences as means of changing prejudices. Some improvements in attitudes were evident following intervention, but were dismissed by the review authors due to the lack of statistical results and high methodological limitations of all studies. 136The failure to take into account important participants' characteristics throughout the studies in this review was also a cause for concern. Specifically, all studies failed adequately to report the gender, age, and religion of participants, all of which have been indicated to affect attitudes towards minority sexual groups, and should therefore be taken account of, when designing, implementing and assess ing an intervention. While Bouris et al. (2010) do not address the efficacy of a specific intervention, they explore and highlight the important influence that parental attitudes can have on the mental health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual young people. These findings are important, as incorpo rating these parental influences could be a useful strategy for the development and implementation of future interventions. Once again, the authors are reluctant to draw firm conclusions due to the methodological limitations of their included studies. Their concerns here include the reliance on convenience samples, which make it difficult to generalise results to the wider p opulations. In additional, there is currently a lack of prospective longitudinal findings, which could provide better detail on the precise mechanisms of parental influences. Finally, echoing the concerns of Tucker and Potocky-Tripodi (2006), this review concludes that inadequate attention was paid towards the heterogeneity within the minority sexual groups sampled, particularly race, ethnicity, cultural and family values, all of which could impact parental attitudes and responses, as well as the dynamics of the family relationship. Despite this, the review authors were able to identify two important dimensions of parenting that appeared in the overall pattern of results that coul d influence the health and well-being of lesbian, gay, and bisexual young people. These were: (i) parental knowledge and response to child's sexual orientation; and (ii) emotional qualities of parent-child relations hip, including support, caring, and parent-child connectedness. In addition, across the studies, pare ntal rejection was also identified as having a negative association with all health areas. This highlights the complexity of parental influences, in that they can \"serve as a source of stress and a source of support\". The review authors also highlight that these may not be the only parental dimensions of importance, as they are just those identified by the included studies. Additional parenting influences that were not examined that could be of importance include parental monitoring, and communication. While no reviews were identified relating to the mental health of transgender young people, or gender identity disorder, a protocol is in development for a Cochrane systematic review focusing on the effects of CBT for Gender Identity Disorder in childhood. This review is expected to be completed in the next 6 to 8 months. The author of this review has concurred, based on the preliminary results of his search, that high quality trials in this area are lacking (Turner 2011). Implications for future research Building on the results of the included reviews, some possible research priorities for this area may include the following: 1. First and foremost, there is a demonstrable gap in research on transsexuals and young people with gender identity disorder in the last five years. This is an essential area to address, particularly considering the high rates of depression and suicide previously cited. 2. While some attempts have been made at examining important influences on the mental health of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young people, attention should be directed towards the design, implementation and assessment of interventions directly aimed at these young people, focusing on the coping skills necessary to deal with minority stress, s hould it occur. 3. Both included reviews highlight the need fo r greater account for to be taken of the diversity of participants' characteristics in research. Research must take account of the 137varying effects that age, gender, religion, culture and ethnicity could have on mental health, and ensure these considerations are incorporated into the interventions. 4. It is also important to prepare for the likelihood of cumulative effects. Specifically, changes in attitudes, both internal and external, are likely to occur gradually, and require repeated doses of an intervention. Again, this should be incorporated into an intervention and recipients of the intervention should be prepared for this accordingly. 5. Some general methodological points were highlig hted that should be incorporated into future work, including the need to move beyond convenience samples, and incorporate more prospective longitudinal work. Table 12.3: Excluded Studies - interventions to address the mental health issues relating to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered young people Study Reasons for Exclusion Hatzenbuehler 2009 A comprehensive overview of research regarding th e stigma many sexual minorities face, and the subsequent stress they may experience. A frame work is postulated to aid the understanding of the process, and which could potentially lead to development of intervention strategies. However, there was no well-described search strategy and no focus on interventions per se. . Herek and Garnets 2006 Provides a comprehensive overview of research on factors affecting mental health among sexual minority populations, with factors such as mino rity stress and stigma playing a prominent role. Current mental health practises are also discusse d, and attention is drawn to the APA guidelines for Affirmative Practice with sexual minority clients. However, this review could not be classified as a systematic review, as there was no description of the search process of search strategy. Levine 2009 Reviews the challenges faced by this population, and some interventions th at may allow them to reduce their risk behaviours, most notably, reco mmendations for providing 'culturally sensitive care' for sexual minority youth. No well-described search strategy / search process. Lewis, 2009 Focus on the prevalence of mental health issues in sexual minorities.

(personal communication, April 06, 2011) 139CHAPTER 13 Interventions to prevent self harm and suicide Introduction Although self harm and suicide are being considered in the same chapter, it is acknowledged that they may be distinct issues, albeit with over laps between them. As Bursztein and Apter (2008) argue, 'Suicidal behavior is probably a set of noncontinuous and heterogeneous spectra of behaviors. Thus, suicidal ideation, suicidal thre ats, gestures, self-cutting, low lethal suicide attempts, interrupted suicide attempts and near fatal suicide attempts and actual suicide may or may not be related to each other, depending on th e context in which they are studied...preventive methods may be different for the different subtypes of suicidal behaviors in adolescents' (p1). In this chapter, self-harm refers to non-suicidal self-injury and suicidal behaviour refers to behaviour that it motivated by the desire to die. There is variation in how these terms are used internationally, for example deliberate self-har m in the North American literature sometimes includes attempted suicide (Bethell and Rhodes 2008 ). The World Health Organisation (cited in Nordentoft 2007: 311) has defined suicide as 'a n act with a fatal outco me, which the deceased, knowing or expecting a fatal outcome had initiated and carried out with the purpose of provoking the change that he desired...Parasuicide...commonl y used to refer to all non-fatal suicidal acts [is defined] as 'An act with a non-fatal outcome, in which an individual deliberately initiates a non- habitual behaviour that, without intervention from others will cause self-harm, or deliberately ingests a substance in excess of the prescribed or generally recognized therapeutic dosage, and which is aimed at realizing changes which the subject desired via the actual or expected physical consequences.' Hawton and James (2005) have argued that ' The term deliberate self harm is preferred to \"attempted suicide\" or \"parasuicide\" because the range of motives or reasons for this behaviour includes several non-suicidal intentions. Although adolescents who self harm may claim they want to die, the motivation in many is more to do with an expression of distress and desire for escape from troubling situations. Even when death is the outcome of self harming behaviour, this may not have been intended' (p891). Leitner et al. have provided a very clear set of definitions that distinguish between the main terms used: Suicide The termination of an individual's life resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative act of the victim himself which he knows will produce this fatal result (Durkheim 1857). Attempted suicide A potentially self injurious action with a non-fatal outcome for which there is evidence, either explicit or implicit, that the individual intended to kill himself or herself (Moscicki 1997). (Deliberate) Self-Harm An acute non-fatal act of self harm carried out deliberately in the form of an acute episode of behaviour by an individual with variable motivation (Gelder et al 2001). Suicidal Ideation The existence of current wishes and plans to commit suicide (Steer et al. 1993) ( Leitner et al. 2008:170). The focus of this chapter is on interventions that aim to prevent self-harm and/or suicide. The risk factors and trends in suicide and self harm are not, therefore, considered in depth, but are briefly summarised in order to provide some sense of this context. Hawton and James (2005) highlight that the common characteristics of young people who die by suicide are: broken homes (separation, divorce, or death of parents); family psychiatric disorder or suicidal behaviour; psychiatric disorder or behavioural disturbance; substance misuse (alcohol or drugs); and 140previous self-harm. This reinforces the possib le overlaps between self-harm and suicide. They also suggest that possible reasons for the rise in male suicides in the UK include: increased rates of family breakdown; increasing rates of substance misuse and de pression; greater instability of employment; increased availability of means for suicide; media influences (thought to contribute to 5% of suicides in adolescents); and awareness of suicidal behaviour in other young people (page 891). Interventions to prevent suicide and self-harm are extremely diverse and provided across a range of levels and settings. Nordentoft (2007) discussed three possible models for organising these interventions. The first is to distinguish betwee n primary, secondary and tertiary interventions. Primary prevention is aimed at people who have not yet shown any indication of self harming or suicidal behaviour. Secondary prevention aims at early intervention with those who are identified as being at risk so involves interventions such as screening. Tertiary intervention targets people who are known to be self-harming or who have engaged in suicidal behaviour. An alternative model is to distinguish between universal, selective and indicated prevention. Universal interventions would be aimed at the whole population in question (all children and young people, all school age children, all children in specific areas). Selective prevention is targeted on preventing the development of self harm and suicidal behaviour in specific high-risk groups. Indicated prevention then would focus on people who have been identified as showing the early signs of self-harming or suicidal behaviour. A third possible way of classifying preventive interventions is to distinguish structural (such as restricting means, addressing social exclusion) from individual measures (such as media campaigns, counselling and treatment). These issues of definition and classification are important to convey the complexity of the range of interventions that aim to prevent self-harm and suicide. A common theme throughout the literature is that unfortunately there is no one size fits all approach for the prevention of self-harm and suicide (Pitman 2007), and that there needs to be careful consideration of the developmental context of the children and young people (Daniel and Goldston 2009), their cultural context (Joe et al. 2008 and Goldston et al. 2008) and their social context (Burrows and Laflamme 2010). The Northern Ireland Context In the Northern Ireland context, the Bamford Review's report (2006) on mental health promotion reinforced the need to prevent suicide. It stated: According to Fay et al (1997)...in the 25 years from 1969 to 1994, more people died here by suicide than as the result of the conflict. On average since 2000, deaths due to suicide have exceeded deaths on the road. Suicidal behaviours place a heavy human and financial burden on society in Northern Ireland. Figures from DHSSPS (2002) indicate that there are on average 150 suicide deaths every year in NI, 80,000 working days are lost to illnesses related to attempted suicide; and that there are over 4,000 hospital admissions annually as the result of suicidal behaviour. The estimated annual cost to the economy of suicidal behaviour is \u00a3170m. Although suicide accounts for 1% of all deaths annually it equates to 7% of potential years of life lost, indeed the expected years of life lost to suicide is estimated to be 4,400. (Bamford 2006:.92) The Bamford Review's (2006) report on child and adolescent mental health services emphasized the role of schools in primary prevention and recommended the \"healthy schools\" approach combined with more targeted approaches - it also highlighted the particularly high rates of self- harm and suicidal behaviour among LGT young people. At the secondary level, it suggested that 'there is a need to address the prevention of suicide through multi-modal programmes, probably best delivered via education services' (p46), and at the tertiary level, it highlighted the needs of 141children who have experienced abuse and looked after children. The Bamford Action Plan (2009) summarised how the policy context for self-harm and suicide prevention has developed in Northern Ireland. It stated that: the ' Promoting Mental Health Strategy and Action Plan (2003) set out a cross-sectoral agenda aimed at improving mental health and wellbeing. This was followed by more detailed work on suicide prevention. Protect Life - A Shared Vision was published in 2006 to address the rising trend in suicide. It includes a set of actions both at population level and targeted at people and communities most at risk. In 2008 the Health, Social Services and Public Safety Assembly Committee issued its Report on the Inquiry into the Prevention of Suicide and Self Harm, making a series of recommendations for further action. A cross-departmental response to the Committee's report and a timeframe for implementation were endorsed by the Executive in March 2009 (Bamford 2009:24). In their review of progress on the three main relevant strategies (the Bamford Review of Mental Health and Learning Disability; the Promoting Mental Health: Strategy and Action Plan 2003- 2008 ; and the Protect Life: A Shared Vision \u2014 The Northern Ireland Suicide Prevention Strategy and Action Plan 2006-2011) , Leavey et al. (2009) recommended that the mental health promotion and suicide prevention strategies s hould be merged and th at the priorities for intervention should include early-years intervention and parenting strategies, as well as supporting schools to promote resilience and well-being. There has been some research which considers self-harm and suicide among children and young people in Northern Ireland but, as Tomlinson (2007) concluded, 'there are major gaps in the available knowledge and research on how children and young people are positioned in relation to self-harm and suicide in NI' (p.441). He recommended various research priorities including 'to monitor relevant hospital atte ndances for Parasuicide...explor ing how families and local communities cope with depression, self-harming an d suicide...the processes that lead to suicide clustering...[and] the role of popular culture, new communications and the Internet in mediating ideas about suicide' (p.441). More recently, Arensman (2010) was commissio ned by the DHSSPS to review the evidence for the Protect Life - A Shared Vision 2006-2011 , the Northern Ireland suicide prevention strategy. This is not only addressing the needs of children and young people, but it is still immediately relevant. Her findings will be considered in more depth below, but one of the key recommendations was that \"actions for which substantial and consistent research evidence is available be implemented at national level as a matter of priority in the next phase of Protect Life... These actions include: Population approaches To restrict access to means and methods of suicide, including identification of \"hotspots\", the promotion of safer prescribing, a reduction in the accessibility of certain over the counter drugs, and restriction of access to firearms). Develop clinical guidelines for all HSS staff to use when dealing with people who are at risk of suicide/self harm. Targeted approaches To implement programmes that enhance the coping and problem solving skills of those who self harm, and which reduce the risk of repeat self harm\" (p52). Arensman (2010) also made clear recommendations for future evaluation of suicide prevention in Northern Ireland. She suggested that \"Evaluating the effectiveness of suicide prevention 142programmes, it would be recommended to in clude intermediate ou tcomes (e.g. improved awareness and knowledge of suicidal behaviour, increased confidence, attitude change, increased referral etc.) in addition to primary outcomes (e.g. suicide, deliberate self harm)...In addition to outcome evaluation, it would be recommended to conduct an independent process evaluation in order to identify factors that may hinder progress in achieving milestones and deliverables that are required in order to me et the targets set\" (p60). Results of the search The search strategy identified 632 records, of which 53 were duplicates leaving 579. Of the 579 publications cited, 513 were judged irrelevant, mainly because they were not reviews of interventions, and/or their focus was not on prevention, and/or there was no specific consideration of children and/or young people. A further 4 reviews were identified through Google and Google Scholar keyword searches, and so a total of 70 were considered in further detail. The search strategy for the databases wa s limited to reviews from 2005, but the Google searches identified an extremely important systematic review (Crowley et al. 2004), which, because of its immediate and direct relevance, was included. Only systematic reviews that considered interventions aimed at preventing self-harm and/or suicide in children and young people were included. Of the 70, 46 were excluded primarily because they were not systematic reviews, or were not concerned with interventions, and these are detailed in Table 13.3). 24 were included (see Table 13.1). The inclusion criteria are listed in Box 13. BOX 13: inclusion criteria - Interventions to prevent self harm and suicide POPULATION: children and/or young people INTERVENTION: prevention of self-harm and/or suicide COMPARISON: any comparison OUTCOME: impact on self-harm and/or suicidal behaviour Excluded studies Table 13.3 sets out the characteristics of excluded studies. These tend to be reviews of interventions that have not employed a systematic approach, and/or are more focused on the identification and exploration of risk factors. Nonetheless, some important issues are raised. Brown et al. (2007), Cwik and Walkup (2008), and Nordentoft (2007) all make the case for prioritizing large scale randomized controlled trials of suicide prevention interventions. They also discuss some of the complex methodological and ethical issues involved. The excluded studies also highlight some important considerations for developing, implementing and evaluating interventions. These include culture (Goldston et al. 2008; Joe et al. 2008), gender (Smalley et al. 2005) and the wider social context (Lee et al. 2010). Included studies Table 13.1 sets out the characteristics of the 28 included systematic reviews. These reviews cover an extremely wide range of interventions, which perhaps reflects the comp lexity of the issues involved. 143Quality of reviews The quality of the included reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR criteria, and the results are presented in Table 13.2. The AMSTAR profile suggests that most reviews have serious methodological shortcomings. Although most report sound search strategies and a clear plan for the conduct of the review, their reporting of the detailed methodology is often poor (e.g. only 3 provided details on excluded studies). Few consid ered unpublished material. More significantly, only nine author teams explicitly assessed the quality of studies included within their review, and only seven used this information when drawing their conclusions. As a whole, the reviews covered a very heterogeneous set of interventions, which is probably why only six reviews included any meta-analyses. Some reviews themselves contained very diverse interventions, and this is reflected in the paucity of systematic reviews that undertook meta-analyses. Some of the reviews that covered a broad range of interventions nonetheless 'scored well' on most AMSTAR criteria (e.g. Crowley et al. 2004 and Robinson et al. 2011). Of the more focused reviews, those by Crawford et al. (2007) on interventions following self-harm, Guo et al. (2010) on means reduction, Hetrick et al. (2007) on SSRIs, and Tarrier et al. (2008) on CBT are of above average quality. For the most part, however, the conclusions drawn by these review teams is based on a combination of assessing the 'weight' of evidence (using a version of 'vote counting'), and critical judgement that could not be tested against a less subjective means of synthesising data. Findings There has been a lot of activity in reviewing the available evidence of 'what works' in preventing self-harm and suicide. Were th e conclusions of the reviews mo re definitive, one would have cause for concern. As it is, most revi ews do not draw strong conclusions. Many of the reviews excluded from consideration in this chapter also contain thoughtful and potentially useful research evidence. Burrows an d Laflamme (2010) draw a similar conclusion to those of earlier writers, namely that the issues are complex, embracing developmental, contextual and individual factors. Given this complexity, it is unlikely that there is a 'one size fits all' approach to prevention, of either self-harm or suicide (Daniel and Goldston). Indeed, a dominant theme throughout the literature is that the evidence for any one proposed intervention is either limited or very limited (see Robinson et al. 2011). The focus is definitely more on suicide prevention, so should maybe highlight self-harm findings - group CBT with young offenders (Townsend et al. 2010). Promising approaches include means restriction and CBT (Tarrier et al. 2008). Concerns about SSRI use (Reith and Edmonds, 2007) and screening (Pe\u00f1a and Caine, 2006) are false positives. 144Table 13.2: AMSTAR ratings - Intervention s to prevent self harm and suicide 'A priori\" design?

's (2004) recommendations fo r future research still seem to be the priorities. These are that we need: larger trials; studies examining the socio-economic gradient and the wider structural barriers to mental health; process and qualitative evaluations; studies of the effectiveness of helplines, means reduction and the role of media in NI context, and a focus on high-risk groups, impact of self-harm and suicide awareness training. Arensman's (2010) recommendations for service de velopment also seem important to reinforce, especially building in evaluation to all prevention interventions, working on means reduction, developing guidelines for staff, and to implement programmes to develop the skills of young people who self-harm. 146Table 13.1: Included Studies - Interventions to prevent self-harm and/or suicide Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To review of the evidence base for Protect Life - A Shared Vision : The Northern Ireland Suicide Prevention Strategy Arensman 2010 118 published papers, 12 books and 17 reports were included. Details of all studies not included. Wide range of settings. All ages but included some research which focused on children and young people. Public information campaigns Community based programmes Gatekeeper training Multi-level community based suicide prevention programmes Means restriction Support for parents Support networks School based prevention and anti- bullying Early identification and access to services Suicide awareness / positive mental health /well-being and substance misuse training for relevant staff Brief problem solving intervention School-based programmes to promote positive mental health Guidelines for health staff Targeted information campaign for the workforce Media guidelines Psychological treatments for self harm Crisis Teams Support for carers Protocols for assessing people who are intoxicated Early identification of and support for survivors of abuse Support for marginalized and/or high risk groups A very wide range of recommendations are presented. The research included in the review was also assessed in terms of its level and consistency. The actions with the best evidence base are identified as: Means restriction, including identification of \"hotspots\" Clinical guidelines for all HSS staff to use when dealing with people who are at risk of suicide/self harm. Programmes that enhance the coping and problem solving skills of those who self harm, and which reduce the risk of repeat self harm. To examine the evidence for the effectiveness of clinical interventions designed to reduce the repetition of deliberate self harm Burns et al. 2005 3 RCTs 4 clinical control trials 3 quasi- experimental studies Initial presentation at hospital Adolescents and young adults Problem solving therapy Intensive management with outreach Readmission on demand Family intervention Group therapy The evidence base for treatments designed to reduce the repetition of self-harm in adolescents and young adults is very limited. Careful consideration should be given to process evaluation to determine which individual elements of any intervention are effective. 147Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To examine whether additional psychosocial interventions following an episode of self-harm reduce the likelihood of subsequent suicide. Crawford et al. 2007 18 RCTs International People who had harmed themselves prior to the intervention Mainly individual psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy and dialectical behaviour therapy Follow-up and access to services Individual randomised trials of psychosocial treatments have demons trated statistically significant reductions in the likelihood of repetition of non-fatal self harm, but such findings do not necessarily mean that these treatments would reduce the likelihood of subsequent suicide. To provide a review of reviews of the evidence of effectiveness for the prevention of youth suicide Crowley et al. 2004 7 reviews of studies 3 UK 2 North America 1 New Zealand 1 Australia Young people Curriculum-based suicide prevention programmes Recognition, management and prevention of youth suicidal behaviour by primary care practitioners Interventions targeting family risk factors Suicide prevention programmes for at-risk groups Potential points of access to those contemplating suicide Prevention of access to means Media restrictions Psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for deliberate self-harm Multi-year (interventions with young people that extend over many years of their lives), multi- component strategies to address high-risk behaviour in school factors among young people should be further evaluated. The impact of reducing access to the means of suicide and the role of media should be further researched. To review published controlled studies of psychosocial treatment interventions for reducing adolescent suicidal behaviour Daniel and Goldston, 2009 5 quasi experimental 7 RCTs International Young people (10- 17) Emergency room intervention Rapid response out-patient service Admission on demand Family intervention Systemic therapy Youth support team DBT CBT There is limited evidence of the effectiveness of interventions in reducing suicide attempts. Given the heterogeneity among adolescent suicide attempters it is unlikely that a 'one size fits all' approach will work. To examine the association between adolescents who die by suicide and their use of SSRI antidepressants. Dudley et al. 2010 4 RCTs 3 with no control group 3 US 2 Sweden 1 UK 1 Denmark 574 young people SSRIs 9 of 574 young people (1.6%) who died by suicide had had recent exposure to SSRIs. The rarity of SSRI usage prior to adolescent suicide does not support the assertion that SSRIs are associated with increased suicide risk. Given the prevalence of depression associated with youth suicide, it favours the conclusion that most adolescents dying by suicide have not had the potential benefit of antidepressants at the time of their deaths. 148Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To summarise the information regarding national means restriction policies/strategies and assess the effectiveness of national/provincial intentional overdose prevention policies/strategies. Guo et al. 2010 Eight national suicide prevention strategy documents Australia Canada England Ireland New Zealand Sweden Wales United States All ages but particular focus on young people Means restriction strategies In general, these policies/strategies do not specifically target children, youths, and young adults. Evaluation of the effects of various means restrictions including intentional overdose prevention in reducing suicidal behaviours is a complex task; hence a syst ematic approach that takes into account all of the important components of a comprehensive framework for a provincial policy/strategy initiative is essential. To provide an overview of the epidemiology and prevention of suicide Hawton and van Heeringen, 2009 Wide range of studies. International All ages but section on young people Strategies targeting high-risk groups Population strategies Clinical studies of suicide prevention are hindered by methodological and ethical problems, especially since many people at risk do not have contact with clinical care. Knowledge about who is at risk of suicide has nevertheless in creased substantially, and a number of interventions show promising effects. Future research must focus on the development and assessment of empirically based suicide-prevention and treatment protocols. To determine the efficacy and adverse outcomes, including definitive suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation, of SSRIs compared to placebo. Hetrick et al. 2007 10 RCTs International, often multi- centre Children and adolescents with depressive disorders Range of SSRIs The evidence for effectiveness of SSRIs compared with placebo in the treatment of depressive disorder in children and adolescents is far from compelling. A large long term pragmatic trial that includes young people who are representative of those who present for treatment is needed. To review the evidence on gatekeeper training for suicide prevention, and propose directions for further research Isaac et al. 2009 13 studies 1 RCT 12 Cohort International All ages Gatekeeper training Gatekeeper training holds promise as part of a multifaceted strategy to combat suicide. It appears positively to affect th e skills, attitudes, and knowledge of people who undertake the training in many settings, but evidence of its impact on suicide rates and ideation is limited. An RCT is needed to delineate its potential for reducing the suicide base rate in a given community. 149Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To provide a comprehensive overview of the known effectiveness of interventions aimed at preventing suicide, suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation, both in key risk groups and in the general population. Leitner et al. 2008 200 primary studies 37 systematic reviews International All ages but only 27 included children and/or young people Escitalopram for children with major depressive disorder interpersonal psychotherapy a psychoeducational intervention in schools involving a youth- nominated support team a token for readmissions to hospital for suicidal young adolescents fluoxetine alone or with CBT youth education programme anti-depressants empowerment-based parent education groups Home-based family interventions School-based interventions Therapeutic interventions including CBT, DBT and family therapy Taken together, the outcomes for studies focussed on children and young adults suggest that we currently have very little evidence of how to proceed in intervening with young people to prevent or reduce suicidal behaviour and, in particular, to reduce suicide. To review research on the link between physical activity and involvement in sports and suicidality. Lester et al. 2010 16 studies, mainly surveys US Children and young people (adults considered but findings not reported here) Physical activity Sports participation Physical activity and sports participation may have a beneficial impact on suicidality, at least in boys. To examine the evidence for the effectiveness of specific suicide preventive interventions and to make recommendations for future prevention programmes and research. Mann et al. 2005 10 systematic reviews 18 RCTs 24 Cohort 41 population based studies Developed countries All ages Awareness and education Primary Care Physicians Gatekeepers Screening Pharmacotherapy Psychotherapy (including CBT and problem solving) Follow-up after attempt Means reduction Media Suicide prevention interventions should be multi- modal, evidence-based, guided by specific testable hypotheses, and implemented among populations of sufficient size to yield generalisable and reliable results. Programmes must include outcome measurement. To comprehensively review of school- based suicide prevention programs from a public health perspective. Miller et al. 2009 13 studies Public schools Children and young people Universal and Selected suicide prevention programs The current scientific foundation regarding school- based suicide prevention programs is very limited. 150Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for pediatric patients with suicide-related emergency department visits. Newton et al. 2010 7 RCTs 3 quasi experimental studies Emergency departments (EDs) Children and young people ED- based delivery (1) post discharge delivery (6) ED transition interventions (3) Transition interventions appear most promising for reducing suicide-related outcomes and improving post-ED treatment adherence. To review research on risk factors and interventions for suicidality among Norwegian youth Nrugham et al. 2010 29 studies on risk factors Norway Upper mean age limit of 25 years. Focus on risk factors Gun control CAMHS Skills training Impact of interventions barely studied. Non-intact parental units need to be supported and intact parental units maintained. Early detection and management of suicide attempts, depression and alcohol use should be targeted as suicide prevention interventions among adolescents. To review the evidence of the effectiveness and safety of screening as a tool to prevent suicide among adolescents. Pe\u00f1a and Caine, 2006 17 studies Mainly schools and clinics Adolescents Screening instruments While youth suicide screening programmes offers the promise of improving identification for those who need treatment the most, further research is essential to understand how, when, where and for whom screening programmes can be used effectively and efficiently. To assess the role of drugs in suicidal ideation and suicidality Reith and Edmonds, 2007 No information. Seem to be mainly drug trials Range of countries Children and adults SSRIs Newer antidepressants There is evidence of an association between SSRIs and other newer antidepressant drugs and treatment-emergent suicidal ideation and suicide- related behaviour in children and adults. A systematic review of interventions for adolescents / young adults who presented to a clinical setting with risk of suicide attempt, suicidal ideation and/or deliberate self-harm Robinson et al. 2011 15 RCTs International Adolescents and young adults Medication Emergency access card Home-based family intervention Compliance enhancement Youth nominated support team DBT Problem solving interventions CBT Group therapy The evidence regarding the effective interventions for adolescents and young adults with suicide attempt, deliberate self-har m or suicidal ideation is extremely limited. CBT shows some promise but further investigation is needed. To systematically review the treatment of suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents Steele and Doey 2007a ;b No detail of the final number of studies included. International Children and young people Assessment Hospital-Based services Alternatives to hospitalization and other outpatient services Follow-up after discharge from ED The assessment of youth at risk for suicide should include attention to well-established risk factors, but prediction remains difficult. Treatment of should be evidence-based and may include psychotherapy and pharmacology. Effective methods of prevention are emerging, but more research is needed. 151Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To synthesize the literature on youth suicide risk factors and prevention strategies; evaluate quality of information about these on selected Canadian websites; determine if website source was related to evidence-based rating (EBR); and the association of website quality indicators with EBR. Szumilas and Kutcher, 2009 Five systematic reviews. The top 20 most commonly accessed youth suicide information websites were analyzed for quality indicators and EBR. Focus is on Canadian websites but the systematic reviews are international Children and young people Information regarding youth suicide on selected websites Fundamental to addressing youth suicide is the availability of high-quality, evidence-based information accessible to the public, health providers, and policy- makers. Many websites, including those sponsored by the federal government and national organizations, need to improve the evidence-based quality of the information provided. To investigate whether Cognitive- behavioral therapies (CBTs) would reduce suicide behavior Tarrier et al. 2008 28 studies All had to have a comparison group 14 US 5 UK 2 Holland 2 Denmark 1 Australia 1 Canada 1 India 1 Ireland 1 Israel Adolescents (7) Adults (21) CBT or CBT as a component of intervention Overall, there was a highly significant effect for CBT in reducing suicide behavior. Subgroup analysis indicates a significant treatment effect for: adult samples (but - impo rtantly for this - review not adolescent),; individual treatments (but not group), and for CBT when compared to minimal treatment or treatment as usual (but not when compared to another active treatment). To examine whether interventions relevant to young offenders with mood or anxiety disorders, or problems with self- harm are effective. Townsend et al. 2010 10 RCTs 7 US 1 Scotland 1 Japan 1 New Zealand Young offenders with a mean age of 19 or under Medication] Group work Skills training Range of psychotherapeutic approaches These preliminary findings suggest that group-based CBT may be useful for young offenders with such mental health problems, but larger high quality RCTs are now needed to bolster the evidence-base. 152Table 13.3: Excluded Studies - Interventions to prevent self-harm and/or suicide Study Reasons for Exclusion Apter and King 2006 Overview of the management of depressed, suicidal children and adolescents. Concludes that research has yet to identify the treatment of choice for suicidal patients. Suggests that treatment st rategies should be multi- dimensional, targeting the suicidal behaviour, mental health problems, personality factors and environmental factors. Points out that lack of continuity of care places pati ents at elevated risk for additional suicide attempts. Berman 2009 This commentary on school- based suicide prevention presents some research advances but is not a systematic review. It highlights that the great majority of these prevention efforts are universal programmes, the weakest overall in their evaluated effectiveness. Berman et al. 2006 This book chapter considers the treatment of suicidal adolescents. It is not a systematic review. It highlights the core role that attachment plays in both the problem and its resolution, and the need for individual care plans. Bethell and Rhodes 2008 Focuses on the roles of suicidality and deliberate self-harm in adolescent depression and emergency department use. Highlights overlap between depression an d suicidality and self-harm and so the need to identify and refer when people present at hospital. Not a systematic review. Birbal et al. 2009 Considers cybersuicide and adolescents. Literature reviewed to explore the issues/cases rather than consider interventions. Recommends that guidelines for the media on reporting suicide should be adopted for the internet and that the websites should be monitored. Brown et al. 2007 Not a systematic review. Argues that few suicide prevention strategies have been evaluated in rigorous trials and that there are randomised trial designs th at are both feasible and ethical and can be used to test programmes and implementation strategies for population- based suicide prevention. Borrows and Laflamme 2010 A review of studies examining the relationship between socioeconomic status and attempted suicide over a 20 year period. Bursztein and Apter 2009 A non-systematic review of adolescent suicide. Concludes the overall empirical evidence about effective ways to prevent or treat suicidality in youth is quite low. Preventi on efforts usually include interventions such as screening for depression and suicide risk in schools and clinical settings, suicide awareness and education programmes, gatekeepers' training for school staff, hotlines, means restriction and pharmacological treatment and CBT/skills training. Chachamovich et al. 2009 Explores the association between depression and suicide. Not a systematic review but suggests further research should explore in depth the world of a suicidal person and consider specific, even individual strategies for prevention. Campo 2009 Examines the relationship between youth suicide and access to care. Wide range of studies considered but not systematically. Concludes that education and training of professionals and service users, the integration of mental health services in primary care, and the use of novel technologies to track and maintain contact with at-risk youth are worthy of study. Cohen 2007 Reviews all the controlled trials of SSRIs in child and adolescent depression although no search strategy provided. Meta-analyses revealed no data supporting the use of SSRIs except fluoxetine. Cwik and Walkup 2008 Reviews, but not systematically, existing studies of interventions for suicidal young people, describes the challenges in selecting the population, treatment and control conditions, and outcome measures, and discusses tradition RCT and alternative methodological approaches. de Leo and Heller, 2008 Draws on data from four large studies to consider the role of social modelling in the transmission of suicidality. Found that suicidal behaviours among respondent's social groups were important predictors of suicidal behaviour in the respondents themselves and that, in an adolescent population exposure to fatal suicidal behaviour did not predict self-harm but exposure to non-fatal suicidal behavi ours was predictive of self-harm and suicide ideation. This may inform the potential impact of containing information about suicidal behaviours. Donaldson et al. 2010 Not a systematic review. Chapter highlights the importance of considering engagement, including barriers created by services, when intervening with adolescent suicide attempters. Dudley et al. 2008 Non-systematic review of the efficacy and safety of new-generation antidepressants with depressed children and adolescents. Practical clinical strategi es for acute phase treatment suggested. Evans et al. 2005 Book on treating and preventing adolescent mental health problems. Section on youth suicide provides a non- systematic overview of the prevention literature. Suggests that more rigorous methods are needed to evaluate youth suicide prevention programmes. Glaif et al. 2007 A systematic review on suicida lity, depression and alcohol use amongst adolescents over thee previous 15 years. No focus on interventions 153Table 13.3: Excluded Studies - Interventions to prevent self-harm and/or suicide (continued) Study Reasons for Exclusion Goldston et al. 2008 Not a systematic review but does highlight the importance of cultural considerations in adolescent suicide. Reports that there are some cross-cutting issues such as protective factors, spirituality and family. Explores the need for culturally sensitive and community based interventions. Greydanus and Shek 2009 Explores deliberate self-harm in adoles cents but is not a systematic review. Recommends that priorities for research should include the role of spirituality and family proce sses, and that both qualitative and longitudinal designs should be used more. Grunebaum and Soleimani 2010 Book chapter on suicide prevention. Not focused specifically on children and adolescents but briefly considers adolescent suicidality. Reports that evidence supporting schools-based suicide awareness programmes has been largely inconclusive except for the Signs of Suicide programme (Aseltine and DeMartino, 2004). Also mentions gatekeeper programmes (training school staff to identify suicidal young people) but acknowledges that research on effectiveness is limited. Hawton et al. 2006 Book focusing on deliberate self-harm and suicidal ideas in adolescents. No systematic review of the evidence for prevention but concludes that research is needed on: young people who engage in self-harm in the community but who do not present at hospital; longitudinal studies; the contagious nature of self-harm; evaluations of new interventions; the needs of specific sub-groups; and the role of the media and the internet. Headey et al. 2006 Reviews the evaluation of 156 local suicide prevention projects that are part of Australia's National Suicide Prevention Strategy. Reported that successful projects tended to understand contextual factors, investigate participants' needs, draw on sound evidence, develop multi-faceted strategies, develop stakeholder support, and employ capable staff. Hoffmann 2006 Describes the development of a web- based psycho-educational programme that deals with the lived experiences of adolescent suicide survivors. Primary research but does provide a non-systematic review of psycho-education approaches. Horowitz et al. 2009 Reviews suicide screening in three different settings: schools, primary care clinics and emergency departments. No search strategy provided. Concludes that valid, brief and easy-to-administer screening tools can be used to detect risk of suicide in children and adolescents, targeted s creening in schools, and universal screening in primary care clinics and emergency departments may be the most effectiv e way to recognise and prevent self-harm. The impact of suicide screening in various settings needs to be further assessed. Joe et al. 2008 Reinforces the need to consider the role of culture in ad olescent suicidal behaviour in order to develop prevention strategies. Not a systematic review. Joe and Bryant 2007 Non-systematic review of suicide prevention screening, warning signs and risk factors to inform discussion of suicide screening in schools. Concludes that schools are an effective setting for suicide prevention and that screening and referral interventions are promising. Klomek and Stanley 2007 Considers psychosocial treatment of de pression and suicidality in adolescents. Not a systematic review. Asserts that there are only two evidence-based psychotherapies for adolescence depression: cognitive-behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy. Lee et al. 2010 Focuses on risk factors for youth suicide in South Korea and isn't a systematic review but does apply ecological systems theory to provide a structural to consider issues wi thin the context of micro, meso, exo, macro, and chrono systems. This reinforces the complexity of the issues that may need to be addressed by effective prevention. Miklowitz and Taylor 2006 Describes the evidence for family focused therapy (psych oeducation, communication skills training and problem solving) for working with people with a diagnosis of bipolar who are suicidal. Not a systematic review. Miller et al. 2007 Focuses on dialectical behaviour ther apy but also provides a non-systematic review of the literature on the effectiveness of treatments for suicidal adolescents. Concludes that outpatient psychosocial treatments targeting suicidal behaviours directly, particularly CBT, are effective in reducing the risk of future such behaviours in high risk individuals. Miller and Eckert 2009 Non-systematic review with focus on demographic data; risk factors and warning signs; and where, when, and how youth suicidal behavior typically occurs rather than prevention. Nixon and Heath 2009 Section on intervention and prevention issues for non-suicid al self-injury in young people. It is not a systematic review but does provide an overview of possible uni versal, selective and indicated interventions. Nordentoft 2007 Focuses on the prevention of suicide and attempted suicide in Denmark. Excellent overview of the issues and research but not a systematic review. Concludes that large randomised clinical trials examining the effectiveness of interventions to reduce rates of suicide attempt and suicide should be a high priority. 154Table 13.3: Excluded Studies - Interventions to prevent self-harm and/or suicide (continued) Study Reasons for Exclusion Pfeffer 2006 This chapter on suicide and suicidality among children and adolescents doesn't provide a systematic review but does suggest some areas for future research: the developmental course of young people who are bereaved by suicide, the effectiveness of methods for screening, education strategies, enhancing help-seeking and psychosocial and pharmacological treatments. Pitman 2007 Discussion, rather than a systematic review, of the literat ure informing suicide prevention policies. It is argued that interventions may have differential effects in specific risk groups, whic h may include paradoxical increases in risk. For these reasons, policy makers may need to abandon the goal of one treatment for all and focus on the distinct subgroups of patients at risk when selecting, evaluating and implementing preventive interventions. Portzky and van Heeringen 2007 Literature review on deliberate self-harm in adolescents. Brief details of the methodology but no search strategy. Concludes that the association between the use of antidepressants in depressed children and adolescents and the emergence of suicidal behaviour continues to subject to conflicting evidence. Suggests that the results regarding CBT in depressed and suicidal young people are clearly positive. Posner et al. 2007 Focuses on the identification and monitoring of suicide risk in primary care settings. It isn't a systematic review but raises the issue that concerns about suicidal ideation and behavior associated with young people's antidepressant treatment have led to declines in pres cribing. They suggest there is now concern about under- treatment of depression and the subsequent impact on su icide rates. Reinforces that primary care settings offer opportunities to identi fy those at risk of suicidal behaviour. Sher and Zalsman 2005 Not a systematic review. Reports that alcohol abuse and su icidal behaviour in adolescents and in adults has been found to have biochemical, genetic, and psychological correlates. Suggests that treatment of adolescents who alcohol problems and suicidality should follow an integrated protocol that addresses both issues. Smalley et al. 2005 Reviews, but not systematically, r ecent research on the social context of suicide in young people, with particular reference to evidence about the gendered character of suicidal behaviour. Concludes that of all the aspects of the social context of youth suicide, one of the most important and also one of the most gendered is the effect of unemployment. Argues that the impact of macro-level social policy should be included in any suicide strategy and that gender issues should be further explored in research. Spirito and Esposito- Smythers 2006 Provides a comprehensive overview of risk factors and considers prevention relatively briefly. Reports the prevention program with the best evidence to date combines an education awareness component on depression and suicide with a screening programme: the Signs of Suicide program (Aseltine and DeMartino, 2004). Wagner 2009 Book on suicidal behaviour in children and adolescents and includes a chapter on prevention. It is not a systematic review and concludes that there is a great need for systematically testing innovative, theory-based, and well- designed prevention programmes for young people. Wasserman and Wasserman 2009 Good overview, especially of internat ional perspectives but not systematic. Chapters on young people and effective treatments. Concludes that it has not been conclusively demonstrated that either antidepressants or psychotherapy reduce suicidal ideation or risk of suicidal behaviour. It also mentions this may be in part due to the exclusion of most suicidal individuals from clinical trials. Westefeld et al. 2010 Focuses on children under 13 and argues that issues related to preadolescent suicide should be considered separately from adolescent suicide. Not a systematic review. Wintersteen et al. 2007 Review, but not systematic, of screening for suicide risk in the pediatric emergency and acute care setting. Conclude that practitioners in these settings are we ll positioned to identify, assess and appropriately refer. 155Included reviews Arensman, E.

The focus is, therefore, on interventions that aim to improve parental mental health and parenting, rather than interventions to support children whose parents have mental health problems, which are addressed in Chapter 15. There is some overlap between these two areas, and some interventions are aimed at both parents and children, but the focus in this chapter is on the aspects of these interventions that are aimed at the parents. There have also been some difficulties identified at the interface between adult mental health services and child care services, and interventions to address these difficulties are also briefly discussed but are not the focus of the review. To provide the context of the review estimates of the prevalence of parental mental problems, the need for intervention and the Northern Ireland context are explored first. Parental mental health problems Based on findings from national surveys of mental health problems, Parker et al. (2008) have estimated that, at any one time in Great Britain, nine to ten per cent of women aged 16-65, and five to six per cent men aged 16-65, are parents with mental health problems. Most of these will have common mental health problems, such as depression or anxiety, and only a very small proportion (0.5% or fewer) will have some form of psychosis. Th e Social Exclusion Unit (2004) has highlighted that some groups of parents may be at higher risk of developing mental health problems. It reported that ' Levels of depression are highest among the mothers of young children, lone parents and those who are economically inactive. 28 per cent of lone parents have common mental health problems. Post-natal depression is estimated to affect one in ten new mothers and usually starts within six weeks of the birth. Research suggests that a mother's prolonged post-natal depression may have a negative effect on the child's cognitive development and social relationships' (p75). The Social Exclusion Unit (2004) also suggested that parents with mental health problems and their families are one of the four groups most likely to be excluded from health and social care provision. There may also be a range of barriers for parents with mental health problems seeking help from services, including possible concerns about the involvement of social services, and how their parenting may be assessed. The 2003-2005 National Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health reported that 'Psychiatric disorder and depression are common during pregnancy and following birth. Ten per cent of new mothers are likely to develop depression in the year following childbirth, of whom between a third and a half will be suffering from a severe depressive illness. A particularly severe form of mental illness, puerperal psychosis will occur in 2 per thousand births. Women with a history of serious mental illness have an increased risk of recurrence in the post natal period' (CEMACH 2007:173). Drawing on these data, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) placed an emphasis on the perinatal period (p regnancy and first six months after birth) in its consultation document Service Framework for Mental Health and Wellbeing (DHSSPS 2011). 160Parrott et al. (2008) have estimated that over one third of all UK adults with mental health problems are parents, and that two million children live in households where at least one parent has a mental health problem (p1). Of these parents, less than one quarter is in work. The authors go on to point out that the 'potential stressors leading to parental mental health problems include a lack of money; breakdowns in valued relationships, bereavement, loss of control at work and long working hours' (p1). These findings may provide some indication of the prevalence of parental mental health problems in Northern Ireland but, as identified in Chapter 3, there is a need for a high quality, large-scale prevalence study in Northern Ireland that would include identification of peop le who are parenting. The need for intervention with parents who have mental health problems. It is important to acknowledge that most parent s with mental health problems do parent their children effectively (Parrott et al. 2008; Evans and Fowler 2008). Parental mental health problems do not always impact negatively on children's health, development and wellbeing and a range of factors (e.g. access to treatment and support, the type of mental health problems and the social and economic circumstance of the family) may influence the nature and extent of any impact (Social Exclusion Unit 2004). In their evaluation of a service initiative to improve the interface between adult mental health and child care services in Northern Ireland, Davidson and colleagues (2010) summarised the rationale for addressing mental health as follows: ...mental health problems may impact on the development and safety of children in a wide range of ways that may combine and interact. There may also be a negative cycle of impact where the affected child may then have emotional and behavioural needs that may increase the stress of parenting and so have a detrimental effect on the parent/s's mental health. The mechanisms ... can be both direct and indirect (Manning and Gregoire 2006; Social Exclusion Unit 2004). ....The direct effects may include genetic factors, prenatal development and exposure to their parent/s' mental health problems after birth, which may impact on attachment and development. The indirect effects may include socio-economic deprivation, exposure to related issues such as substance misuse, relationship conflict and domestic violence, and additional caring responsibilities. It has been estimated that 29 per cent of young carers are looking after a family member with mental health problems (Dearden and Becker 2004) and it is important to acknowledge the possible compl exities and dynamics involved (Aldridge and Becker 2003) The stigma associated with mental health problems may also be an important factor for parents, children and professionals as it may affect many aspects of how people think of and behave towards themselves, others and services (Sartorius 2007). (p3). Obviously, affected children are also more likely to have mental health problems in adulthood. As long ago as 1995, a major finding from the overview report Child Protection: Messages from Research (Department of Health 1995) was the high levels of parental mental health problems, alcohol and drug misuse, and domestic violence in families of children who become involved in the child protection system. Cleaver et al. (1999) reported that parental mental health problems may combine and interact with a range of other factors, especially substance misuse and domestic violence, to create multiple and cumulative ad versities that are associated with a range of negative outcomes for children. Concerns about the impact of parental mental health problems on children have been reinforced by the repeated finding that parental mental health problems have been a feature of cases in which 161children have sustained serious injury or been killed. Falkov's (1996) study of serious case reviews found that in a third of cases, the parent/s had mental health problems. Sinclair and Bullock (2002) found that in 18/40 serious case reviews (45%) at least one parent had mental health problems. Kearney et al. (2003) interviewed ch ild care social workers who estimated that between that between 50 and 90 per cent of parents they were working with had mental health problems, or alcohol or substance misuse problems (Davidson et al. 2010). Recent overviews of Serious Case Reviews in England report similar findings (Brandon et al. 2008; 2009). Northern Ireland policy and service context In Northern Ireland, the need to provide effect ive interventions for parents with mental health problems has been reinforced by recent inspection and inquiry reports (Independent Inquiry Panel to the Western and Eastern Health and Social Se rvices Boards (O'Neill Inquiry), 2008; Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) 2006). There have b een two major developments in recent years to attempt to improve the services provided to this gr oup. The first is that Northern Ireland is one of the pilot sites for the implementation of Social Care Institute of Excellence (SCIE)'s (2009) Think Child, Think Parent, Think Family guidance, which is aimed at improving outcomes for parents with mental health problems and their families. This work is being carried out by the Mental Health and Children's Services Project, was set up in April 2009, and is overseen by the Health and Social Care Board. The Project is working with all of the Trusts to implement SCIE's priority recommendations across nine areas: signposting and improving access to services; screening; care; reviewing care approach; workforce development; and notably in the cont ext of this rapid review - generating more evidence about what works. The focus, so far, has been on the first three priority recommendations, but it may be important to consider how evidence could be generated as part of the implementation process to help inform consideration of the impact of the service developments. The Project has also developed so me performance measures that could facilitate evaluation, but the data that is routinely collected at present is insufficient to enable this. The second development is that the Service Framework for Mental Health and Wellbeing (DHSSPS 2011) currently pr oposes that 'All women presenting to maternity service should be asked about past or present mental illness and treatment including at their first contact visit with primary care, the booking visit, the 3rd trimester visit, during the post-natal contact period between 6-10 weeks and up to 1 year postnatal. Where appropriate, they should be referred to specialist mental health services that include access to psychological interventions, additional health visitor support and inpatient care as appropriate and in accordance with NICE guidelines' (Standard 45, p173). This possible service deve lopment may present further opportunities to develop the evidence base in Northern Ireland. Results of the search The search strategy identified 838 records, of wh ich 80 were duplicates, leaving 758. Of the 758 remaining citations, 739 were judged irrelevant, as they were not directly concerned with reviewing interventions to help parents provide good enough parenting. Amongst these were papers that focused on: the impact on children of parental mental health problems; interventions aimed at supporting children of parents with mental health problems; primary research on specific initiatives and interventions; and resear ch on interventions to address mental health 162problems or parenting. A further six reviews were identified through Google and Google Scholar keyword searches, and so a total of 25 were considered in further detail. Of the 25, 11 met the inclusion criteria and these are listed in Box 14. 14 papers were excluded and Table 14.3 sets out the reasons for their exclusion. Box 14: Inclusion Criteria - Interventions to he lp parents with mental illness parent their children. Population: PARENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS Intervention: ANY INTERVENTION THAT AIMS TO SUPPORT PARENTING Comparison: ANY COMPARISON Outcome: ABILITY TO PROVIDE GOOD ENOUGH PARENTING Included reviews Table 14.1 sets out the characteristics of included reviews. The coverage of the included reviews seems comprehensive, in terms of settings and interventions. There are a number of important gaps in the research, as discussed below. Quality of reviews The included reviews appeared to be generally very clear and rigorous (see Table 14.2). Only two reviews undertook meta-analyses. There seemed to be some differences in what was meant by excluded studies - in some of the reviews this refe rred to all studies that were identified in the search and not included. In these cases, the excluded studies tended not to be listed. Findings The main recurring finding is summarised by Barlow and colleagues (Barlow et al. 2008; 2010): There is a lack of high-quality, particularly UK-based, research about the effectiveness of interventions delivered during the postnatal period in supporting parenting to promote optimal outcomes for children. (Barlow et al. 2008:26). The review by Barlow and her colleagues covered a very wide range of interventions, and the authors draw some tentative conclusions abou t possible directions based on the available evidence. They conclude that the evidence suggests that the focus of support shortly before and after birth (perinatal support) should be the parent-infant relationship, including both mothers and fathers. They suggest a range of 'stepped services' are needed and conclude: There is indicative evidence to support the use of a range of innovative and dyadic methods of supporting the parent-infant relationship such as video-feedback; infant massage; methods of increasing the parents awareness of the infants perceptual and sensory capabilities; parent infant psychotherapy. Many of these techniques (e.g. skin-to-skin care; infant carriers; anticipatory guidance etc) should be part of the routine guidance that is offered to parents... Targeting of services should as far as is possible be undertaken within the context of universal provision. Promotional interviews 163provide an exemplar of the type of strategy that staff could use to identify families in need of further support...Primary care practitioners (particularly midwives and health visitors) should be routinely and universally assessing for 'deep-seated' problems such drug-abuse and domestic abuse. (Barlow et al. 2008:.26) The review by Parker et al. (2009; see also 2008) confirmed the dearth of relevant evidence and concluded that there were 'no secure messages ... about which interventions or ways of providing services would best support parents with mental health problems and their children' (p20). They recommend investment in high quality interventions and service development, with similarly good quality evaluations of their effects (p20). They also highlight the potential of a simple screening tool, which had been used to identify mental health problems amongst parents in healthcare settings in the USA (Olsen et al. 2006). The screening tool appeared to be acceptable to parents, and it served as a prompt to professionals to discuss issues with those parents identified as having a problem, and refer them for specialist support. They conclude that such this tool could usefully be evaluated in the context of a range of UK healthcare settings to see if the apparent benefits were generalisable (pp19-20).

The first was a Finnish intervention provided to all parents being treated for mental health problems - the Effective Family Programme . The authors suggest this as a possible way of implementing system wide intervention (Boyd and Gillham 2009). The other was an evaluation by the Family Welfare 164Association (Morris 2007), which was highlighted by Parker et al. (2009) because 'The Family Welfare Association built routine evaluation in to its development of this model by using validated outcome measures with all families. A similar approach when developing other services or interventions to support parents with mental health problems and their families would help to transform the evidence base in this under-researched area' (Parker et al. 2009, pp20-21). It would certainly be a leap forward if evaluation was routinely included in all new service developments and interventions. Implications for practice and gaps in research As well as the general need for high quality re search on interventions to support parents with mental health problems, the reviews identified a number of gaps in the research which provide direction for future studies in Northern Ireland. Parker et al. (2009), building on Bates and Coren (2006), identified five major questions: Are the experiences and needs of fathers with mental health problems different? The literature is dominated by research on mothers or unde fined 'parents', who ar e usually mothers. Are the experiences and needs of parents with mental health problems from BME communities different from those of parents with mental health problems in majority communities and, if so, how best can they be identified and supported? What is the direction of the relationship between socio-economic disadvantage and common mental health problems among parents, particularly lone parents? What role can and should employment, housing and education services play in identifying and supporting parents with mental health problems and their families? How can service providers ensure that their services are what parents with mental health problems and their families want and, when they are what they want, that they are able to use the support that is on offer? In light of the current developments in Northern Ireland and informed by the findings of this rapid review, some possible research priorities for the Northern Ireland context could be: There is a clear need, as identified in Chapter 3, for the prevalence of parental mental health problems in Northern Ireland to be identified. If the Service Framework for Mental Health and Wellbeing is to introduce a screening tool, there is an immediate need for possible tools to be piloted and their effectiveness evaluated (Parker et al. 2009; see also Yelland et al. 2009 in the excluded studies). As highlighted by Parker et al. (2009) an important contribution to developing the evidence in this area would be to build in evaluation studies from the beginning. This, therefore, could be considered as part of the ongoing work of the Mental Health and Children's Services Project, as it works through the implementation of SCIE's (2009) guidance. The current focus on this area may also provide opportunities for high quality research on specific interventions, and the review offers a wide range of promising possibilities. As is highlighted above there is a major gap in the international literature on the experiences and needs of fathers with mental health problems, as the focus is usually on mothers, and particularly mothers with depression. This might be an area Northern Ireland could lead on. 165Table 14.1: Systematic reviews of interventions for parents with mental health problems Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To identify effective health- led interventions to support parents, parenting and the parent-infant relationship during the perinatal period and beyond Barlow et al. 2008 39 systematic reviews 2 reviews of reviews 24 individual studies were included on expert advice Wide range of types of study included from RCTs to qualitative Studies from many different countries included and interventions across a range of settings Expectant mothers and fathers, and parents Reviews the evidence for a wide range of interventions used: i) at various stages of parenthood from Preparation for Pregnancy through to support in early parenthood; ii) for parents in high risk groups, such as those experiencing domestic violence or with substance misuse problems; teenage parents iii) to assist parents with learning difficulties; iv) to support parents with particular challenges, such as child behaviour problems Interventions reviewed include i) information based interventions; ii) psychosocial interventions including home visiting; ii) a range of parenting classes, interventions to promote attachment and bonding, and iv) interventions designed to address a wide range of issues associated with promoting infant mental health and wellbeing, e.g. smoking cessation programmes, treating obesity. There is a lack of high-quality research about the effectiveness of interventions delivered during the postnatal period in supporting parenting to promote optimal outcomes for children. Particularly so in the UK The evidence suggests that the focus of support that is provided to both mothers and fathers during the perinatal period should be the parent-infant relationship. A range of stepped services are required. There is indicative evidence to support the use of a range of innovative and dyadic methods of supporting the parent- infant relationship such as video-feedback; infant massage; methods of increasing the parents awareness of the infants perceptual and sensory capa bilities; parent infant psychotherapy. Many of these techniques (e.g. skin-to-skin care; infant carriers; anticipatory guidance etc) should be part of the routine guidance that is offered to parents. Targeting of services should as far as is possible be undertaken within the context of universal provision. Promotional interviews provide an exemplar of the type of strategy that staff could use to identify families in need of further support. Primary care practitioners (particularly midwives and health visitors) should be routinely and universally assessing for 'deep-seated' problems such drug-abuse and domestic abuse. There is an urgent need for further research in a number of areas: The best methods of providing antenatal preparation for childbirth and the transition to parenting; Best methods of supporting fathers; Methods of supporting alcohol and drug abusing parents, and parents with serious mental health problems during pregnancy. 166Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To provide an overview of research on: The extent and detection of parental mental health problems (PMHP) in the UK The impact of PMHP on the wider family The accessibility, acceptability and effectiveness of available /potential interventions for parents with mental health problems. Bates and Coren 2006 754 studies included Wide range of methods including survey methods (192), case control design (130), non-systematic reviews (100), cohort studies (74) and systematic reviews (15). Wide range of countries and settings but largest numbers from USA and UK. Wide range of participants included The largest category of intervention types in the map are parent training and programmes, followed by interventions focused on education, social support and counseling. A number of gaps have been identified in this mapping exercise. Firstly, there were few studies in the map that focused on male participants only - a gap in the primary research that should be considered in future primary research commissioning. Another example is the lack of systematic reviews that specifically consider the accessi bility of interventions. There also appeared to be more available literature on depressive illness than on other disorders, indicating further potential gaps in the evidence base. Furthermore, there are few studies in the map coded as employment advice, housing or financial advice. This may also reflect a gap in the research literature in relation to the effectiveness, accessibility or acceptability of these interventions. To review interventions for parental depression from toddlerhood to adolescence Boyd and Gillham 2009 19 studies included Had to have a control or comparison group 15 x USA 1 x UK 1 x Canada 1 x Australia 1 x Korea Children aged 18 months to 18 years and parents with a depressive disorder or elevated depressive symptoms Toddler-Parent Psychotherapy Group CBT Cognitive-behavioural family intervention Parenting Psychoeducation group Preventive Intervention Project Cognitive-Behavioural Group Therapy Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Depressed Mothers Coping with Depression Therapy for adult depression can be expanded to focus on parenting experiences. The import ance of educating families with parental depression about depression and its impact on children is highlighted. Interventions that teach behavioural parenting techniques may also be helpful. Although the findings from existing studies are promising, it is too early to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions that are designed to promote well-being in children of depressed parents. A Finnish intervention called Effective Family Programme which is provided to all pare nts being treated for mental health problems is mentioned as a possible way of implementing intervention. 167Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To assess the effects, on mothers and their families, of non- pharmacological / psychosocial / psychological interventions compared with usual ante partum care in the treatment of antenatal depression. Dennis and Allen, 2008 1 RCT 1 x USA 54 pregnant women with depression Maternal massage Acupuncture specifically treating symptoms of depression The evidence is inconclusive to allow us to make any recommendations for massage therapy or depression-specific acupuncture for the treatment of antenatal depression. The included trial was too small wi th a non-generalisable sample, to make any recommendations. To assess the effects, on mothers and their families, of psychosocial and psychological interventions, compared with usual ante partum care in the treatment of antenatal depression Dennis et al. 2007 1 RCT 1 x USA 38 pregnant women with depression Interpersonal psychotherapy The evidence is inconclusive to allow us to make any recommendations for interpersonal psychotherapy for the treatment of antenatal depression. The one trial included was too small, with a non-general isable sample, to make any recommendations. It is remarkable that only one psychological or psychosocial trial of antenatal depression was of adequate quality to be included in this review. The treatment of antenatal depression using psychosocial and psychological interventions is an area that has been neglected, despite the research clearly indicating that antenatal depression is a strong risk factor for postpartum depression. 168Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To review the effects of mother and baby units for mothers with schizophrenia or psychoses needing admission during the first year after giving birth, and their children, in comparison to standard care on a ward without a mother and baby unit. Irving and Saylan, 2007 None N/A N/A N/A Mother and bay units are reportedly common in the UK but less common in other countries and rare or non-existent in the developing world. However, there does not appear to be any trial-based evidence for the effectiveness of these units. This lack of data is of concern as descriptive studies have found poor outcomes such as anxious attachment and poor development for children of mothers with schizophrenia and a greater risk of the children being placed under supervised or foster care. Effective care of both mothers and babies during this critical time may be crucial to prevent poor clinical and parenting outcomes. Good, relevant research is urgently needed. To summarize the constraining barriers and issues for the psychiatric workforce according to: i) policy and management; ii) interagency collaboration; iii) worker attitude, skill and knowledge; iv) parent- consumer; v) the consumer's family, including children. Maybery and Reupert, 2009 28 studies Broad inclusion criteria, qualitative and quantitative included Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Sweden, the UK and the USA Children, parents and professionals Focus on barriers to intervention For the psychiatric workforce to become family focused (particularly in relation to children) there is a clear need for family sensitive policies and procedures, managerial and organizational support and well-targeted and sustained workforce training. However, there are multiple barriers to the adult mental health workforce becoming family focused including: Some adult mental health services do not identify consumers who are parents and subsequently do not respond to children, parenting and family needs. Organizations often do not have adequate family and child friendly policies and procedures. The adult mental health workforce lacks skills and knowledge about families, children and parenting. The workforce needs to increase encouragement of consumers to include family members and dependent children in treatment of the ill parent including the provision of psycho-education. 169Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions Four questions: 1. What do we know about the numbers and types of parental mental health problems (PMHP) in the UK? 2. What systems, tools and opportunities are there for detecting PMH problems? 3. How accessible and acceptable are services or interventions for parents with MHPs and their children? 4. What are the outcomes of services or interventions intended to support parents with MHP and their families? Parker et al. 2009 Question 1 (n=39) Question 2 (n=24) Question 3 (n=68) Question 4 (n=40) Range of types of study Q: 1 - UK Q: 2-4 - International Range of participants Q:1 - national surveys and surveys of sub-populations Q: 2 - identification of parental mental health problems Q: 3 - factors associated with access and engagement Q: 4 - CBT, depressive symptom intervention, parenting programme, interpersonal psychotherapy A very simple screening tool for identifying mental health problems among parents in healthcare settings in the USA seems acceptable to parents and prompts professionals to discuss issues with the ident ified parents and refer them for specialist support. Research could test this tool in the different healthcare settings in the UK that parents and children use to see if it has similar effects. Those who work with parents and families in poor socio- economic conditions should be aware that they are likely to be dealing with a higher than average proportion of parents with mental health problems. However, parents in poor circumstances may have different priorities about support. Dealing with parents' financial or housing problems may be necessary before or alongside intervention aimed at managing their mental health problems clinically. Both parents with mental health problems and their children can be anxious about the likely consequences of identifying themselves to professionals. Multi-disciplinary teams that cut across traditional service or agency boundaries, and which allow professionals properly to understand and draw on each other's expertise, might be a better way of ensuring that both adults and their children have access to acceptable support. Unfortunately, no research evidence was found about such models of service delivery and their outcomes. Overall, there were no secure messages from the review about which interventions or ways of providing services would best support parents with mental health problems and their children. There is a clear need here for investment in good- quality interventions and service development and good- quality evaluation of their effects. 170Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To examine the published evidence of the effectiveness of postpartum support programs to improve maternal knowledge, attitudes, and parenting skills and maternal mental and physical health, and quality of life. Shaw et al. 2006 22 studies RCTs 7 x USA 5 x Canada 5 x Australia 4 x UK 1 x Ireland Post natal women from immediately after birth to one year Home visits Pediatrician visits Phone follow-up Debriefing after birth Education No randomized controlled trial evidence was found to endorse universal provision of postpartum support to improve parenting, maternal mental health , maternal quality of life, or maternal physical health. There is some evidence that high-risk populations may benefit from postpartum support. To evaluate empirical studies that attempted to improve observed mother-infant relationships in order to inform a potential approach for mothers with schizophrenia. Wan et al. 2008 9 studies Only empirical evaluations included 5 x USA 3 x UK 1 x Canada Mothers with depression (8 studies) Mothers with eating disorders (1 study) Toddler-parent psychotherapy Mother-infant therapy Vocational/social rehabilitation and 'mood induction' Social support group Nurse home visits Range of therapies Massage Video feedback Overall, approaches that emphasise the mother-child dyad, such as sensitivity-focused behavioural techniques and toddler-parent psychotherapy, were most efficacious for improving maternal sensitivity/child attachment. Although individual psychological therapies are the more conventional treatment, little current evidence suggests that mother-infant relations improve with symptom reduction. To identify whether individual and group family interventions for adolescent substance abuse enhance the mental health of other family members. . Yuen and Toumbourou, 2008 9 studies 6 quantitative 3 mixed methods/qualitat ive CA Parents and other family members Family interventions The available literature s uggests that a number of determinants of family mental health may potentially be impacted through family intervention for adolescent substance abuse. However, definite conclusions cannot be made at this point as the literature is mostly descriptive and there have been few longitudinal studies or randomized controlled trials. 171Table 14.3: Excluded Studies - Interventions for Parents with Mental Health Problems Study Reasons for Exclusion Balaji et al. 2007 Not a systematic review. No search strategy repo rted. Presents a review of research on social support networks and maternal mental health which concluded that interventions that combine multiple treatment approaches may be more effective in addressing mental health and mothers with more supportive networks have better mental health outcomes. Carter et al. 2010 Not a systematic review. No search strategy re ported. Provides a review of literature on post- natal depression, relationship problems and relevant interventions. Then outlines a treatment manual for interpersonal psychotherapy to address post-natal depression. Feinberg et al. 2006 Not a systematic review. No search strategy reported. Reviews interventions for screening and treating maternal depression in paediatric and other primary care settings. Gentile and Bellantuono, 2009 A systematic review of the safety of specific anti-depressant medication during pregnancy in terms of foetal structural abnormalities rather than direct interventions to address parenting. Parrott et al. 2008 Not a systematic review but a SCIE research briefing on stress and resilience factors in parents with mental health problems and their children. The focus is on the underlying factors relevant to stress and resilience and so interventions are not considered in depth but it is concluded that a multi-faceted and multi-level approach to building resilience through the provision of effective support for individuals, families and communities is needed. Ranson and Urichuk, 2008 Not a systematic review. No search strategy reported. Provides a broad overview of studies that explore parent-child attachment and its influence on bio-psychosocial outcomes. It is therefore also not directly addressing interventions but does suggest that the literature on the impact of attachment issues suggests that further research should explore the potential of prevention and promotion interventions to provide education and support for parents. Rothman, 2008 Not a systematic review. No search strategy re ported. A practice focused article providing an overview of the management of depression in the postnatal period. It encourages professionals to identify antenatal and postnatal depression and to consider a wide range of treatment options including guided self-help, computerised cognitive behaviour therapy, exercise, non-directive counselling, brief behaviour or interpersonal therapy, group work, infant massage, diet and exercise. Singleton, 2007 Not a systematic review, though it does provide a brief overview of the issues and some examples from Scotland and Australia of inte rventions to address parental mental health problems. It encourages support to be provided to the whole family. Solari et al. 2009 Not a systematic review, no search strategy. Sets out a range of recommendations for non- pharmacological interventions for mothers with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The interventions include: addressing pregnancy-specific symptoms, providing psycho-education and psychotherapy, assessing and supporting parenting capability, and assisting women with proactive family planning. The interventions to directly support parenting included parenting classes, parent support groups, co-parenting and parenting coaching. Suppaseemanont, W. Not a systematic review, no search strategy. Overview of interventions to treat depression during pregnancy. Concerns about the safety of anti-depressant medication for the foetus are considered. Winklbaur et al. 2008 Systematic review but the focus is on interventions for pregnant women dependent on opioids. There is some discussion of pharmacological treatment during pregnancy of the mental health problems that these women may have. Yelland et al. 2009 Not a systematic review, no search strategy. Di scussion of the National Perinatal Depression Plan in Australia which will introduce: routine screening for depression during pregnancy and 2 months after birth; follow-up support and care for women who are assessed to be at risk of or experiencing depression; and training for professionals to help them screen and assess. The article considers some of the debates and evidence about screening which may be relevant to the proposal in the Service Framework for Mental Health and Wellbeing (DHSSPS, 2011) to introduce routine screening in Northern Ireland. 172References: included studies Barlow, J., McMillan, A.

In this section, we report the results of four reviews of interventions aimed at supporting the children of parents with mental health problems. The focus is, therefore, on interventions that aim to improve outcomes for children in these circumstances. Given the close relationship between interventions for parents with mental health problems, and those developed directly or indirectly to support their children, some degree of overlap is inevitable. Consequences for children of paren ts with mental health problems Numerous studies have found that parents with mental health problems may experience significant challenges and barriers in providing stable and safe environments for their children, as a result both of their own illness and society's response to people with mental health problems (Mowbray et al. 2000). Four decades of research has established that children of parents with mental health problems are at increased risk of developing mental health problems themselves (Rutter 1966). It is of concern that this associ ation has remained relatively unchanged over this period. More recently, Nicholson et al. (2008) showed that poor developmental outcomes are four to six times more likely for children of parents with mental health problems. Furthermore, Gunlicks et al. (2008) indicated that children of depressed parents, compared with those of non- depressed parents, are more likely to develop psychiatric illness, including depression, anxiety, and externalising disorders. They are also at increased risk for social, cognitive, and medical difficulties. These risks may be genetic, or related to the consequences of the illness with respect to parenting, or to marital a nd social difficulties (Beardslee et al. 1998). The need for interventions with children of parents with mental health problems These negative patterns of intergenerational transmission of mental health difficulties are of concern. Epidemiological studies have shown that almost one in four families have, or have had, at least one parent with a mental health problem (Kessler et al. 2005; Maybery et al. 2009), with over two million children in England and Wales living with parents or carers with mental health problems (Gould 2006). Furthermore, 50% of adults who access mental health services are parents with dependent children (Seeman and Gopfert 2004). The World Health Organisation data indicate that, by 2020, depression will be the most prominent disorder after heart disease (Pretis and Dimova 2008) Thus, as Maybery and Reupert (2009, p785) argue, 'Given the prevalence and associated risk for children whose parents have a mental illness, it is essential to develop appropriate preventative in terventions for such families'. Northern Ireland policy and service context The Northern Ireland policy and service context for children of parents with mental health problems is addressed sufficiently in the previous chapter. 176Results of the search The search strategy identified 149 records, of which four were duplicates. Of the 145 publications cited, 129 were judged irrelevant as they were not concerned with the children of parents with mental health problems, or the parents themselves. 17 publications were judged to be relevant. A further six reviews were identified through Google Scholar keyword searches, giving a total of 21 publications considered in detail. Of the 21, 4 met the inclusion criteria listed in Box 15. 17 publications were excluded, and Table 15.3 specifies the reasons for their exclusion. Box 15: Inclusion criteria - interventions for children of parents with mental health problems POPULATION: children of parents with mental health problems INTERVENTION: any intervention that aims to support children COMPARISON: any comparison OUTCOME: ability to withstand negative impact of parental mental health problems Included reviews Table 15.1 sets out the characteristics of included reviews. All four are concerned with the relationship between parental mental health problems and children well-being. However, only one of the reviews was focused upon intervention programmes for children of parents with mental health problems, the remaining three examined this issue indirectly, by looking at interventions at the parental level that would help their children. Quality of reviews Although a comprehensive search strategy was employed, only one systematic review was identified (Gunlicks and Weisman 2008), highlightin g the need for further systematic review in this area. In order to ensure adequate coverage of relevant literature, the inclusion criteria were further relaxed to capture any reviews of research in which a search strategy had been specified. On this basis, a furt her three reviews were identified (Blewett et al. 2011; Fraser et al. 2006, and Maybery and Reupert 2009). We use the AMSTAR rating system to reflect the limitations of these additional reviews. Only one of the included sources was a systematic review. Consequently, AMSTAR ratings were only moderate . However, in all instances a search strategy had been specified, and several other AMSTAR dimensions were present. 177Table 15.1: Reviews of intervention s to support the children of pare nts with mental health problems Objective Author/Year Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions To review what works in improving the safety, health and wellbeing of children and young people through improving the physical and mental health of mothers, fathers and carers.

AMSTAR ratings for this review were only moderate, so caution is needed when assessing the reliability of conc lusions drawn. Similarly, the remaining reviews were not systematic in nature, and again, all findings and conclusions need to be balanced against the relatively low quality AMSTAR ratings obtained. Fraser et al. (2006) indicated that there was very limited evidence of program effectiveness when assessing well-being or illness outcomes for a child, where a parent or parents has mental health problems. However, there was some evidence that for infants of depressed mothers, baby massage and toddler-parent psychotherapy can be effective. For non-depressed adolescents of depressed parents, group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) was effective (but not effective for depressed adolescents of depressed parents). No evidence was found for the effectiveness of education sessions, home visits from nurses, interaction coaching sessions for mothers, counselling, CBT, or brief psychodynamic psychoth erapy for children of parents with a serious mental illness, when the outcome measured was simply the absence of psychopathology in the child. However, there was some evidence of effective interventions when using surrogate markers of child psychological wellbeing. Infants gained weight and reduced stress, while maternal-child interaction improved, with baby massage and interaction coaching. Child understanding of parental mental illness increased following education sessions led by a clinician. Following home visits from Registered Nurses, mothers' depressive mood scores increased, daily stress levels reduced, and us e of punitive parenting decreased. Counselling resulted in improved infant emotional and behavioural ratings, and more sensitive early mother-infant interactions. Critically though, there was no evidence that these surrogate markers resulted in improved mental health in children. According to Gunlicks et al. (2008), there was some consistent evidence that reduction or remission of parental depressive symptoms was re lated to reduction in child symptoms, and that these child effects were maintained. They found that in five of the nine studies that they examined, where there had been an assessment of the psychopathology of children whose parents received treatment for depression, treatment was associated with improvements in child psychopathology, specifically the reduction in children's symptoms of emotional and behavioural problems, and psychiatric diagnoses. Six studies had focused upon children's psychosocial 179outcomes, and five found that mothers' treatment was associated with child improvements. Treatment of maternal depression predicte d better child academic functioning, global functioning, and enhanced mother-child relationships and interactions. However, no significant associations were found between treatment of ma ternal depression and cognitive development, attachment, temperament, and emotionality. In their knowledge review of improving children's outcomes by supporting parental mental health, Blewett et al. (2011) found that services which combine direct support for children, but also work with their parents within a framework of flexible and tailored support, have been positively evaluated, both within the research-base literature, and also local practice. They found that the quality of the relationship between professionals and the families they supported was a crucial lever for change in a range of serv ices, such as Home-Start and Family Nurse Partnerships. They also found that interventions aimed at reducing parental stress levels, in addition to working with the child, were posit ively associated with improvements in child behaviour. Maybery and Reupert (2009) highlighted a number of barriers faced by the psychiatric workforce when working with families and children, where one or more parents have mental health problems. These are: the lack of policy and consistent guidelines to identify the parenting status of service users when they access psychiatric services; inadequate resource allocation for family-focused practice, including the provision of time, and having to deal with high client workloads; mental health workers feeling that they were unclear whether or not their role allowed them to support the children of their clients; outdated views of management that are resistant to family-focused interventions due to a belief that the family itself is a major cause of the problem; it may be deemed too costly to work with families; lack of liaison between service agencies; mental health workers may be concerned about the possible adverse impact on their relationship with their client if the issue of parenting is raised, with this threatening the therapeutic alliance, and the reluctance of parents sometimes to involve their children and other family members in treatment. Implications for practice A number of features of a family sensitive service were recommended by Maybery and Reupert (2009). These are: a process for identifying service users' children and for establishing relationships with family members (including children); an assessment of the parent, child, and family's basic needs; the provision of education about mental illness to each family member; a clear procedure for referral, and the provision of some form of specialised family approach, such as family therapy or a comprehensive psycho-educational approach. They also argued that greater account should be taken of the views of service users and their families, in identifying future directions for mental health workforce practice. Blewett et al. (2011) similarly argued that much health-related data fails to identify the fact that patients also have a role as parents. Consequently, 180the needs of children in these families often remains invisible, and better data would facilitate better understanding of their needs. Fraser et al. (2006) argued that while currently there is not a robust body of evidence to guide interventions for children of parents with mental health problems, improvements in current service delivery can be made. First, practitioners should use a recognised theory when developing interventions, and should link program components to identified risk factors for this target group. Second, intervention components should be selected from across the public health spectrum, and not remain focused on individual high-risk strategies. Third, this would require a broader range of agencies to be involved in addressing these needs, and the provision of additional training for mental health clinicians. Fourth, future programmes should be evaluated using rigorous methodological design, previously validated tools, and appropriate outcome measures, with the findings of such evaluations widely disseminated. Finally, a longer-term follow-up of participants would greatly enhance assessment of the benefits of interventions over time. Although there is a positive association between early intervention and better outcomes, Blewett et al. (2011) argued that late interventio n is better than no intervention at all. They also noted that although there is an association between parental mental health problems and children's safety, health and well-being, the exact mechanisms involved are only partially understood. Consequently, it cannot be stated that negative outcomes are inevitable, and care needs to be taken in assessing the impact on children of parental health difficulties. Both the characteristics of the parents and children themselves can play a role in determining outcomes. Implications for research In terms of future research, Gunlicks et al. (2008) noted that there are numerous efficacious treatments for adult depression, and that different parental treatments could have different effects on children. Consequently, they argue that a study of the direct comparison of treatment of parental depression with medication versus psychotherapy, which was of sufficient power to determine whether there are differential effects on children, would be of considerable interest and value. They also argue that there is a need for research on the effect on children of treating depressed fathers (with the vast majority of current research on parental depression focused upon the mother). 181Excluded Studies - Interventions for children of parents with mental health problems Study Reasons for Exclusion Barlow et al. 2010 A systematic review of health-led interventions to support parents, parenting and the parent-infant relationship during the perina tal period.

While inpatient treatment is generally effective, alternative treatment is sought for a number of reasons: inpatient care is expensive; there is a shortage of beds; and lack of local provision means children and young people are often placed in adult psychiat ric wards (Department of Health 2004), or in specialized units, long distances from their families (Hewson 2002). Inpatient care may disrupt children and young people's informal social support networks and their education, training or employment. There may be risks associated with inpatient care, such as increased dependency, stigma, discrimination and institutionalisation. For some young people, the trauma of admission may have adverse effects. Further, the difficulties in engaging young people in mental health services are well documented (Minty and Anders on 2004). Over recent decades, in line with WHO, European and UK policy, there has been a shift away from hospital-based treatment for mental health problems, to treatment in community settings. Various models of outreach and intensive community treatment have been im plemented across the UK and internationally. Models developed for adult mental health services include day provision, assertive community treatment, crisis resolution teams, and home treatment. Systematic reviews of such services suggest that they can be successf ul in reducing attrition (Irving et al. 2006; Marshall et al. 2008) and hospitalisation (Irving et al. 2006), and improving patient satisfaction (Marshall et al. 2008). While replicating such models of treatment in child and adolescent services is not adequate, they can be adapted to be developmentally appropriate for use in CAMHS. These alternative services may prevent young people developing a dependency on the hospital environment or being stigmatised. In addition, these services may facilitate the transfer of any therapeutic gains to the young person's every day environment, thus maximising the potential for improved health outcomes to be sustained (Katz et al. 2004), and for educational attainments to be less severely affected (Milin et al. 2000). Assertive outreach Assertive outreach is the term used to describe mobile, multi-disciplinary teams that provide intensive care coordination to a relatively small cohort of consumers with complex needs, who require ongoing proactive and sustained support and treatment to remain living in the community. Over the past decade, assertive outreach approaches in adult mental health have made considerable inroads into services in the UK, in cluding some developments in Northern Ireland. Teams are specifically aimed at people with a severe mental health problem and a variety of complex needs (e.g. alcohol abuse), who are described as 'difficult to engage'. Key features of these teams include a mix of disciplines, low sta ff to client ratio, community-based services, 24- hour coverage, and time-unlimited service. Numerous research studies suggest that assertive outreach delivers better engagement with community services, higher client satisfaction, improvement in quality of life and social functioning, greater housing stability, some symptom 188improvement, reduction in the number of hospita l admissions, reduction in the time spent in hospital, reduced costs, and no increase in family burden (see Wood and Carr 1998). In Northern Ireland, 'early intervention' teams or services for children and young people may be based on an assertive outreach model or approach. The National Service Framework addressed the problem of non-engagement with mental health services with a review of the effectiveness of specialist services. It recommended assertive outreach or assertive community treatment as an appropriate method of providing services to people who do not engage with treatment plans on discharge from hospital. Assertive outreach workers hold smaller caseloads than other mental health professionals in community mental health teams, and visit their clients at home more frequently. They help their clients to maintain their tenancies, secure an adequate income, sustain daily living skills, and adhere to treatment plans to help them to maintain their mental health and develop their independence. Social workers are key members of assertive outreach teams, as they have expertise in working flexibly to assess and meet needs to people within their own homes. The Bamford Review The Bamford review makes recommendations for assertive outreach, which could be delivered by collaboration between Tier 4 and Tier 3 services in conjunction with other agencies. It can take place in an inpatient setting or exclusively as an outpatient assertive outreach model, or in conjunction with day unit provision, but day units are more readily applicable to urban populations than to scattered rural populations, because of distances of travel involved in the latter case (section 6.14). Intensive treatment can be developed as a result of collaboration between CAMHS and social services or education or both. This can be achieved through joint work between Tier 2/3 and Tier 4 CAMHS, or by collaboration between CAMHS and paediatrics, or CAMHS and adult mental health. In order to function effectively, there needs to be close links with, and support from, adequately resourced Tier 2/ 3 specialist CAMHS teams, as well as age appropriate Tier 4 inpatient beds for children and adolescents (section 6.15). Compared to the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland has higher levels of socio-economic deprivation and higher levels of psychiatric morbidity in the adult population, which would suggest that the prevalence of mental health problems is higher among young people here. The Bamford Review reported that there was insufficient capacity in existing CAMH teams to provide the type of Tier 4 assertive outreach and crisis intervention services that were currently operational in England and Wales (section 3.19). Models of assertive outreach/intensive treatment/day unit treatment for young people with complex needs should be developed and implemented by commissioners and providers as a priority (section 6.15). Search strategy Comprehensive searches were conducted in Medline and PsycInfo, as well as the Cochrane Library and the EPPI database. Only English langua ge articles were included, as time restrictions precluded use of translation services. 189Inclusion criteria For a review to be considered systematic, the authors must have searched at least two electronic databases and included either their search strategy or terms used in the searches. Inclusion criteria are set out in Box 16. The results from the search es were initially screened for relevance on the basis of their titles and abstracts, using broad crite ria that were intended to be overly inclusive. Full texts of potentially relevant reviews were then retrieved, and the aims and methods sections were reviewed to determine if they did in fact meet the inclusion criteria. Box 16: Inclusion criteria - assertive outreach , intensive treatment and day units for young people with complex needs. POPULATION: young people with complex needs INTERVENTION: any intervention described as assertive outreach/intensive treatment or day unit treatment interventions COMPARISON: any comparison OUTCOME: improvements in mental health Results of the search The search strategy identified 109 records, however only one suitable systematic review was identified (Shepperd et al. 2008). Two further systematic reviews were identified (Bender et al. 2006; Bird et al. 2010), but on reading the full text, they were deemed unsuitable. Bender et al. (2006) did not include assertive outreach/intens ive treatment or day unit treatment in their systematic review, while in the review by Bird et al. (2010), the focus was not exclusively on young people, and not enough detail on particip ant characteristics were provide in order to separate out relevant results. Due to the lack of systematic reviews in this area, other publications that described, evaluated or reviewed relevant models of intervention were screened for relevance, and are detailed below.

(2008) had two aims: firstly, to identify and assess the effectiveness of the alternatives to inpatient mental health services for children and young people; and secondly, to identify the range and prevalence of different models of service that seeks to avoid inpatient care for children and young people in the UK. The review included a total of 58 studies, made up of seven RCTs, six non-randomised controlled studies, four pre-post test studies with a comparison group, and 41 descriptive studies. These studies described eight distinct models of care, five of which are the most pertinent to the present review area; multi-systemic therapy (M ST) at home, day hospital, case management, intensive outpatient services, and home-based ps ychiatric treatment. Other interventions included were family preservation services, therapeutic foster care, and services provided in residential care. Multi-systemic Therapy (MST) at Home is described by Shepperd et al. as 'an intensive, short- term ecological-orientated therapeutic approach that targets individual, family and community factors contributing to youth ps ychopathology. MST practitioners work with each young person, their family and community associates in identify the determinants of the youth's problems and develop behavioural management techniques. They are also involved in mobilising the problem solving skills of the youth and their families to prevent relapse.' Two RCTs, both from the US, evaluated MST at home (one study reported in two papers - Henggeler et al. 1999 and Schoenwald et al. 2000; Rowland et al. 2005). The therapeutic approach is family-centred, ecological orientated therapy targeting individual, family, peer and environmental aspects of psychopathology in the community. While treatment follows a standard protocol, the intensity is based on the needs of the young person and their family. Therapies include family therapy, behavioural therapy, and cognitive behavioural therapy, and include developing aftercare plans and comprehensive crisis care plans, focusing on mobilising the problem-solving skills within the family and community. The service is available 24-hours a day, seven days a week. Therapists work with the young people in their homes, and maintain service provision if hospitalisation is required. The review found that young people receiving home based MST experienced some improved functioning in terms of externalising symptoms, they spent less days out of school and in out of home placement. At short-term follow up, the control group had a greater improvement in terms of adaptability and cohesion, but this was not sustained at four months follow-up. Intensive Home Treatment was evaluated in two RCTs (Mattejat et al. 2001; Winsberg et al. 1980) and two non-randomised comparison studies (Sherman et al. 1988; Schmidt et al. 2006). Using a child- and family-centred approach, home treatment is used when family dynamics are a significant factor, and is based on ecological theories from family systems using systemic developmental models of symptomatic behaviour, together with family-centred problem-solving approaches. Treatment goals are agreed with the family and can include reducing aggressive behaviour and other maladaptive behaviour and in creasing pro-social behaviours, control of school truancy and supervision of school tasks. Specific interventions are arranged on the basis of individual and family need, and intensity and duration of intervention can vary. The review found that no differences at follow-up were reported between inpatient and home treated children from the two RCTs. One non-randomised study reported a greater improvement in symptoms. 191Intensive outpatient services are multi-disciplinary in nature, usually including psychiatrists, social workers, psychiatric nurses, and psychologists. They cover a wide range of psycho- therapeutic approaches, and typically offer services for a greater duration and intensity than generic services. These can include crisis intervention services that offer a rapid response for the purpose of assessment, stabilisation and follow-up planning of care needs (Sheppard et al. 2008). A variety of these specialist, intensive outpatient services, are provided for high-risk children considered too vulnerable for management in generic outpatient clinics. While home-based treatment assigns one therapist to a young person, families usually have input from multiple professionals. The effectiveness of such services have been ev aluated in two randomised controlled trials, one in the US (Silberstein et al. 1968) and one in the UK (Byford et al. 2007), and by three non- randomised studies which used a comparison group. Of the last three one was conducted in the US (Blumberg et al. 2002) and two in Canada (Greenfield et al. 1995 and Greenfield 2002). Silberstein et al. (1968) described an intensive parental counselling programme involving weekly therapy sessions in behavioural management, combined with medication for children with emotional and behavioural disorders. The UK study examined specialist outpatient clinics for the treatment of anorexia nervosa in the UK, which included cognitive behavioural therapy, parental counselling, dietary therapy a nd multi-modal feedback on weight management (Byford et al. 2007). Shepperd et al. (2008) include in their review a UK based outreach service that provides continuity of care for young people with anorexia nervosa, and is described by Jaffa et al. (2004). The service engages with patients and their fami lies in their homes and at CAMHS outpatient clinics. A rapid-response, intensive crisis management service for suicidal youth is offered by outpatient clinics, and aims to identify the nature of the psychiatric crisis, explore precipitating events, look at individual strengths and weaknesses and work with the young person's support system (Greenfield et al. 2002; Blumberg et al. 2002; Greenfield et al. 1995; Gillig et al. 2004; Ruffin al. 1993). Treatment aims to reframe misconceptions, maladaptive behaviours and poor communication patterns that affect the youth or their family. No differences were reported at follow-up for those receiving intensive outpatient services compared with inpatient care for behavioural or psychological outcomes. 192Table 16.2: Systematic reviews of assertive outreach/ intensive treatment/day uni t treatment interventions Author/Year Objective Number /type of study included Setting Participants Interventions Authors' Conclusions Shepperd et al. 2008 To identify, by systematic review, the different organizational structures and therapeutic approaches described in the literature as alternatives to inpatient mental health services for children and young people, and assess the evidence of effectiveness, acceptability and cost of these alternatives. 58 studies: 7 RCTs 6 non-randomised controlled studies 4 pre-post test studies with a comparison group 41 descriptive studies US (41), Canada (9), Germany (4), UK (3) Finland (1). Children and adolescents with primary diagnosis of emotional and behavioural disorders (46 studies); anorexia nervosa (3 studies) suicide ideation(5 studies) psychosis (1 study), autism (1 study), substance abuse(1 study externalising/ internalising disorders (1 study). 25 studies described interventions aimed at children 12 years and over, while 20 studies described interventions aimed at younger children. The studies described eight distinct models of care: multisystemic (MST) therapy at home day hospital, case management specialist outpatient service home treatment family preservation services therapeutic foster care services provided in residential care Given the current concerns about the scale and management of mental health problems in children and adolescents, a high priority should be attached to improvements in the quality of the evidence base which currently provides very little guidance for the development of services. Prospective comparative systems of audit, conducted across several centres, which include baseline measurement at admission along with demographic data, and outcomes measured using a few standardised robust instruments have the potential to improve the current level of evidence. 193Intensive Day Treatment programmes provide an intensive serv ice, aiming to prevent inpatient hospitalisation or out of home placement, as well as reduce the use of specialist community services. Using a variety of psychotherapeutic approaches, treatment goals may include improved psychosocial adjustment in relationships with self, peers and family, as well as changing behaviour within home, community and school settings, and strengthening community resources for young people. Day hospitals usually include a special education programme, as well as art therapy, psychodrama, psycho-educational programming, medication management, and family therapy. Leisure trips are also sometimes incorporated into day treatment programmes as a reward measure, and also as an opportunity to teach soci al skills. Intensity of treatment can vary across service providers, patients, and stage of treatment, from full-time attendance, to less intensive evening, morning or afternoon sessions. Duration of treatmen t may vary according to the programme and the mental health problem being treated. Staffing is usually made up of a multi-disciplinary team including clinicians, teachers and occupational therapists, and this may be supplemented by an on-call 24-hour child psychiatry service, which can be used for support and consultation. The review found no RCTs of intensive day treatment, however a non-randomised comparison study found no significant differences between groups in terms of being in school or at work, having problems with the law or with people they lived with (Cornwall and Blood 1998). Intensive Case Management aims to arrange a package of community-based services to prevent psychiatric hospitalisation or out-of-home placements. It is offered to children with severe emotional disorders within their home, community and school settings, and may involve stays in residential care prior to rehabilitation in the co mmunity. Case managers determine the needs of individual children through assessment and consultation with families and professionals. 'Wraparound' is one form of case manage ment, involving collabo ration between special education and mental health services, which may include family support specialists to help parents cope with their child's behaviour. Crisis plans are developed to ensure that services are delivered in a timely manner. Case managers can operate on an expanded broker model, where they advocate on behalf of their clients and arrange services for them. Improvements in child functioning are expected through parental training and specific therapeutic interventions for children such as cognitive behavioural therapy, play therapy and social skills training. Crisis case management operates on a 24-hour, seven day week basis. The duration of case management depends on the individual needs of the child and their family, although some home services end after one year (Clarke, 1992). The New York model, described by Evans et al. (1996), reports a mean of 421 days (SD 320) of service enrolment. Case managers have a low caseload and a fixed financial budget for providing services for children in their care (Evans et al. 1996). A non- randomised comparison study compared hospitalis ation rates before and after enrolment into a case management service (Evans et al. 1996). Use of inpatient serv ices fell significantly after enrolment, but lack of psychosocial outcome data for the treatment and comparison groups limits the usefulness of this study. Models of assertive outreach / early intervention teams While the systematic reviews described above highlight areas for service development and future research, they were undertaken a number of year s ago. As our aim was to determine research priorities in relation to models of assertive outreach/intensive treatment/day unit treatment for young people with complex needs, it seemed imperative to have a more recent overview of such 194service provision and gaps in the evidence base. Further searches were conducted from 2008 onwards, using Google Scholar, with broader key word search terms. These identified several empirical articles which were not identified during the systematic searches for review articles. Collectively, they describe national and international developments in community-based service provision for mental health problems, each of which is outlined below. Adolescent Intensive Management Assan et al. (2008) described a model of assertive outreach, the Adolescent Intensive Management (AIM) team, used in Australia to address a gap in young mental health provisions. The AIM team was established as part of the Intensive Mobile Youth Outreach Services (IMYOS) teams, which aimed to target difficult-to-engage adolescents, aged 12-18 years, with extreme risk behaviours, difficult-to-manage behaviours, and multiple residential placements. The multi-disciplinary AIM team offers after-hours and weekend on-call telephone consultation services to clients, their fa milies and other service providers, to facilitate the management of crisis and reduce presentations to emergency departments, and assists emergency clinicians with prompt information and advice. Typical referrals are made for young people with little community connectedness, past hi story of difficulty engaging with the service, and severe co-morbid clinical presentation. The clinical service data presented by the authors indicates that the AIM outreach team engaged successfully with high-risk, difficult-to-engage young people. These young people had a range of complex needs and co-morbidities, including drug and alcohol misuse, disengagement from education, self-harm and suicidality. All young people treated during the 12 month audit period (n=70) were retained by the service, and the high rate of return to education provides some evidence of improvement in functioning. This study is limited in that it is a retrospective review of clie nt data, undertaken by clinical personnel involved in delivering the service. ICEBREAK Another model of community-based early intervention service, implemented in the UK, is described by Farrand et al. (2009). This service, termed ICEBREAK, is aimed at young people aged 16-25 years old with personality disorder. It emphasises building a trusting and open relationship with service users, and includes features associated with assertive community treatment, rather than the provision of a specific therapeutic approach. It is based in the voluntary sector, and is located within a city-centre, hi gh street community organisation that provides a range of services, in order to minimise stigma and increase engagement with the service. In terms of staffing, the service consists of a team leader, six case-managers, a part-time GP specialising in mental health, and a part-time clinical psychologist. Case managers are drawn from a variety of backgrounds, included social work, youth work, education, community psychiatric nursing, fostering, and carer support. In addition to a month-long period of training prior to undertaking the role, case managers receive weekly supervision from psychotherapists employed by the local Primary Care Trust. Upon referral to the service, young people undergo a three-month period of engagement, during which a full assessment of their difficulties is undertaken. Services offered after this period are tailored to the young person 's specific needs, and can involve referrals to specialist mental health professionals, interventions, or community and social welfare services, while continuing to receive support from ICE BREAK, through team-based assertive community treatment, if appropriate. In assessing ICEBREAK's drop-out rate, Farrand et al. (2009) found that young adolescent and adult males with high levels of deprivation, who are more likely to disengage from mental health 195services, were not more likely to drop out from ICEBREAK, suggesting the service is effective in engaging this group of young people. However, drop-out was more likely among young people with multiple emotional and behaviour difficulties, or among those reporting additional mental health problems or substance abuse problems. Future research should investigate how to successfully engage young people with multiple and complex needs, in order to inform service development. Research should also seek to identify and understand young people's reasons for withdrawal from services. Similar to the AIM model of assertive outreach discussed above, the ICEBREAK service was only evaluated here in using client chart reviews, which precludes any statements about the effectiveness of the service. As with the AIM model of assertive outreach discussed above, the ICEBREAK service was only evaluated here in using client chart. Intensive Mobile Youth Outreach Service (IMYOS ) The effectiveness of IMYOS (Melbourne, Australia) was evaluated through a udit of 47 clinical files (Schley et al. 2008). The service offers assistance to young people aged 15-24 years, who display signs of mental illness, are considered 'high-risk' (e.g. of suicide), and have a history of poor engagement with clinic-based services. IMYOS, a sub-programme of ORYGEN Youth Health , a specialist mental health service for young people, utilizes a flexible outreach approach to engagement and treatment, and provides services in the most natural se tting possible, typically client s' homes. A Youth Access Team offers an out-of-hours mobile assessment and acute community treatment for clients. IMYOS staff are multidisciplinary, including three psyc hologists, two social workers, one occupational therapist and one psychiatric nurse, with consultant psychiatry input for two days per week. Each full time staff member carries a caseload of eight to nine young people, and provides an average of two home visits per client per week. IMYOS works within a case management framework. Interventions are multi-systemic an d typically involve the young pe rson, their family, and support systems, such as schools. Audit results suggest that IMYOS significantly reduces the number of clients requiring hospitalisation and the number of inpatient days, when compared to psychiatric hospital admission rates prior to IMYOS. Additi onally, risks measured at referral, such as suicidal ideation, self-harm, viol ence, and crime, were significantly lower at discharge. Again, the evaluation is very weak. The small sample size and lack of control group for comparison have to be borne in mind when interpreting these results. In addition, clients were not included in the audit if follow-up information was missing, and so there is a risk of bias towards young people who were more engaged with the service. Future research using experimental design, for example, including a waiting-list control group or other comparison, with adequate sample size, and validated outcome measures, would allow for firmer conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of assertive outreach approaches with young people. Early Intervention Services across the West Midlands, UK The Department of Health set a target to establish 50 early intervention services for young people aged 14-35 years with first- episode psychosis across England (DoH 2001). Fourteen early intervention services are evaluated using a multiple case-study approach (Lester et al. 2009), eliciting service user, carer and clinician views. At the time of the study, each service was at a different stage of development, ranging from newly established and not yet recruiting patients, to having been in place for 10 years. The majority of services had been running for 6-18 months. Key workers were employed and generally had an active case-load of about 15 service users each. All early intervention services focused on biological issues such as the need to treat presenting psychotic symptoms with low-dose antipsychotic medication; psychological perspectives, including providing individuals with the skills they needed to help them understand their psychosis; and social aspects 196such as help accessing vocational and social ac tivities. All services al so offered family psycho- education. In order to maximise engagement with the service, clinicians reported a number of strategies. For example, priority issues for the young person often centred around education and employment, which were therefore often addressed first, before discussing medication and other issues. Other strategies included meeting in venues with no stigma attached to them, for example, a caf\u00e9, and using text messages to communicate. The service users who were interviewed compared their experiences of inpatient mental health treatment with the early intervention service, and described the former as places where they were treated like children, not listened to, were unable to influence decisions, and where staff constantly changed. By contrast, early intervention staff were described as 'consistent', who 'knew what they were doing', 'cared', 'weren't pushy but listened', and were 'very helpful and gave lots of information'. Illustrating this sense of satisfaction, the majority (90.6%) remained engaged at 12 months af ter inception into the service. The lack of experimental design used in this study, and lack of outcome data reported, limits the conclusions which can be made about the effectiveness of the service. However, almost 500 service users were reported to have been incepted across the 12 early intervention services, and therefore a multi-site RCT evaluation of the service may be appropriate. Evaluation of Service Provision in Northern Ireland The Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority recently published a review of child and adolescent mental health service provision in Northern Ireland. Different models of intensive treatment have been applied in three of the five Trusts (see Table 16.3). Implications for research Shepperd et al. (2008) discuss the methodological quality of the studies included in their review. The quality of the studies included in this review was variable and most studies were under powered. Overall, the standard of reporting on the elements of an intervention is poor with many individual studies failing to report the duration and intensity of an intervention, the training and qualifications of staff, and the use of treatment manual-guidelines or team meetings. This has important implications for replicating these interventions in future research, assessing treatment fidelity across studies, and for the development and implementation of evidence-based research programmes. Furthermore, the majority of the studies included in this review were from the US, making it more difficult to extrapolate results to a Northern Ireland context. Given the current concerns about the scale and management of mental health problems in children and adolescents, a high priority should be attached to improvements in the quality of the evidence base, which currently provides very little guidance for the development of services. Well designed, adequately powered RCTs are needed in this area to determine which services result in the best outcomes for children and young people with complex needs, although the inherent ethical issues involved in such a stud y design is possibly why the evidence-base is currently so weak. Shepperd et al. (2008) make two further recommendations for future research: firstly, the implementation of prospective comparative systems of audit, to include baseline measurement and demographic data at admission, along with outcomes measured using standardised robust instruments. Secondly, they note that few of the studies included in the review mentioned whether they consulted with service users and their parents, or the 197professionals treating them. As a result, it is difficult to determine the acceptability of interventions included in this systematic review , and future research could improve the evidence base using qualitative methods. Table 16.3: Models of intensive treatment in the Trusts. BHSCT and SEHSCT NHSCT SHSCT WHSCT The Belfast Trust provides a range of specialist community CAMH services. The range and provision of specialist CAMHS in SEHSCT was not always evident. The review team found there was good integration with other CAMH services. The review team found this was a model of good practice. Plans are in place to develop a home treatment team as an appropriate and alternative to hospital. Plans are also in place to develop an intensive day service, which is not currently operational. The Northern Trust provides a limited range of specialist CAMHS. The trust does not currently provide crisis intervention or out-of- hours provision. A crisis service was initially developed but had to be withdrawn as the staff member needed to be redeployed to other duties. The Southern Trust has attempted to provide a range of specialist CAMHS. The Southern Trust reported not having developed a specific crisis service but having used funding to develop a community intensive intervention service and out-of-hours hospital liaison service for same or next day hospital liaisons. The Southern Trust reported having a community intensive intervention service, which has been developed and utilised as a step down process for discharge from in-patient care. This is provided by one staff member in each CAMHS team. An out-of-hour's liaison service is provided to acute hospitals at weekends and bank holidays. The liaison officer contacts wards and departments in all the acute hospitals and actively seeks new referrals. The review team found that this may not be the most cost effective option but was assured that the time is used effectively. The Western Trust has a proactive approach to specialist CAMHS but needs to make sure that services are accessible throughout all areas. Service descriptions known as intensive care management system and home treatment appear to be used interchangeably.

Autism Spectrum Disorders Autism Spectrum Disorders are a range of life-long, neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized by deficits in social interaction and communica tion. These impairments become evident in early childhood and, depending on severity, can have implications for learning and social inclusion. Prevalence estimates have shown steady increases over the past four decades. Most recently, a school-based population study carried out in the UK estimated that one in 101 primary school children are diagnosed with ASD (Baron-Cohen et al. 2009). In Northern Ireland, the population prevalence of ASD in 2007 was estimated to be about one in 76 (BELB 2007), and more recently, the Department of Education Training and Inspectorate revealed that the number of school-aged children with ASD in NI had increased from 3000 in 2007, to 4000 in 2010 (DETI 2006; DETI 2009). This increase will undoubtedly have implicatio ns for service utilization and development. This review looks at two particular areas for intervention, namely social skills and communication skills, as these can be particularly detrimental to social inclusion. Social skills Social difficulties are an area of vulnerab ility, even for the most cognitively able children and young people on the autistic sp ectrum (Howlin 2005; Shea and Mesibov 2005). Social interaction is hampered by a fundamental lack of social understanding and understanding of other people's thoughts and feelings. This can make integration in schools, peer groups or communities difficult. A common misconception is that children and young people with autism do not want to form friendships, but it is the desire for friendship, without the necessary social competence, which may lead to many difficulties, including the onset of mental health problem for this group. Communication skills Impairments in verbal and non-verba l communication are fundamental to ASD. Verbal difficulties may include a delay in the development of language, literalness, poorly modulated intonation and delivery of speech, comprehension difficulties, repetitive use of language and unusual vocabulary. Difficulties in social communication include failure to empathise with others, and to appropriately use and interpret social cues, body language and facial expressions. The Northern Ireland context The Bamford report highlighted the social problems faced by children with ASD. Their lack of social skills can lead to peer victimisation, which has longer-term health outcomes, including depression, low self-esteem, anxiety, loneliness and lower academic achievement. Interventions that focus on reducing isolation and integrating individuals into society are key to addressing the needs of these young people. The need to promote social competence and integration for young 200people with ASD is not sufficiently addressed by current services in Northern Ireland (section 3.32). Bamford specified the need for interventions to help children and young people with ASD to develop their social and communication skills , in order to minimise social exclusion and prevent mental health difficulties that can result from exclusion (s ection 5.23). The Autism Bill, passed in March 2011, will also have implications for service provision. Interventions for ASD Interventions designed to support the development of children with ASD are diverse, with a large literature devoted to the evaluation of their effec tiveness. There is no specific treatment for ASD, however, within the UK, interventions used include speech and language therapy, music therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, art, drama, and play therapies. The format of interventions can vary from highly structured dyadic approa ches to more naturalistic programmes in which teaching is guided by the child's interest. Interventions may use broad educational approaches, or target specific areas of development such as communication, or learning and behaviour. Interventions also vary according to their theoretical orientation, mode of delivery, intensity and degree of parental involvement (Krebs Seida et al. 2009). Examples of the interventions currently in use are: Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) Discrete Trial Training Early Intensive Behavioural Interventions Pivotal Response Training Theory of Mind training Milieu training Social Stories Social Skills Groups Video Modelling Despite the widespread evaluation of interventio ns in ASD, variation in how studies have assessed outcome, as well as concerns regarding the rate of variation of individual change (Howlin et al. 2009) have made it difficult to evaluate the validity of research claims. Indeed, studies examining the effectiveness of a variety of interventions have also b een criticised for lack of longitudinal follow-up and the absence of comparable control groups (Myer and Johnson 2007). The large literature evaluating the effe ctiveness of interventions for ASD makes it challenging for health and social care, and educational professionals, as well as policy-makers, to decide which interv entions should be recommended for ASD. There is still a need to evaluate the quality of published systematic reviews. Following a diagnosis of ASD, children and young people, parents and carers, and professionals want effective interventions to be available and need information to help make decisions about what form these could take. There are many different interventions and treatments for ASD in everyday use, some of which are not evidence-based. 201Search strategy Comprehensive searches were conducted in Medline and PsycInfo, as well as the Cochrane Library and the EPPI database. Only English langua ge articles were included, as time restrictions precluded use of translation services. The search strategy (see Medline example given below) consisted of keywords and subject headings for autism and children and young people. Terms which may denote an intervention were included, as well as the terms social and communication skills. Results of the search The search strategy identified 369 records, afte r duplicates were removed. Of these, 320 were judged irrelevant. Of the remaining 49 records, 23 met the inclusion criteria (set out in Box 17). Twenty-six papers were excluded, and Table 17.4 sets out the reasons for their exclusion. Box 17: Inclusion criteria - interventions to improve the social inclusion of children with ASD POPULATION: children under 19 years with Autistic Spectrum Disorders INTERVENTION: intervention to develop social and communication skills in children with ASD COMPARISON: any comparison OUTCOME: improved social and communication skills; social inclusion. Included reviews Table 17.1 sets out the characteristics of the 23 reviews judged to meet the inclusion criteria. Eleven reviews focused on interventions for improving social skills (Ayres and Langone 2005; Spillane 2010; Wang et al. 2011; Williams-White et al. 2007). Five reviews focused on interventions for communication skills, including social communication ski lls, speech, and language development (Flippin et al. 2010; Gold et al. 2010; Howlin et al. 2009; Preston and Carter 2009; van Der Meer and Rispoli 2010). A further seven reviews included both social skills and communication skills as outcomes (Machalicek et al. 2008; Meadan et al.

Many of the reviews had methodological flaws; the most common being that there was not duplicate selection of included st udies, which may introduce bias. Most reviews failed to include unpublished sources of literature in searches, and failed to consider publication bias. Only three reviews provided a list of excluded studies.

There is considerable hete rogeneity in the types of interventions for ASD that have been examined using systematic review methodology. Five broad types of interventions were evaluated in the reviews: i) interventions based on behavioural theory, such as applied behaviour analysis or cognitive behaviour therapy; ii) music- or sound-base d interventions; iii) communication-focused interventions, using tools such as the Picture Exchange Communication System, iv) parent- or peer-training interventions; and v) social skills development interventions, using video-modelling, social stories or social skills training groups. The differences in theoretical construct and program content of interventions based on behavioural theory makes it difficult to interpret the evidence base for this group of interventions. ABA resulted in improvements in adaptive behaviour, communication and interaction, comprehensive language, expressive language, daily living skills, intellectual functioning, and socialisation (Ospina et al. 2008; Virues-Ortega 2010), but, as noted by the review authors, most of the studies in the reviews were of low quality. Spreckley and Boyd (2009) found no evidence of effectiveness of interventions based on ABA. Other interventions based on behavioural theory, e.g. Early Intensive Behavi oural intervention (EIBI; Howlin et al. 2009), were effective for some, but not all children with autism. The two systematic reviews of music therapy yielded conflicting results: the 2006 review by Sinha and colleagues found insufficient evidence to support the use of music therapy, but a later review by Gold et al. (2006) found beneficial effects of musi c therapy on commun ication skills in ASD. The evidence base for communication-focused inte rventions is not well established. The Picture Exchange Communication System showed promise in promoting communication in children with little or no speech (Preston and Ca rter (e.g. with low joint attention, low motor imitation and high object exploration) (Flippin et al. 2010). The evidence base for parent- or peer-training interventions supports the use of parent-training in terms of improving child target behaviours (McConachie and Diggle 2007; Meadan et al. 2009). Peer-training was generally implemented in preschool or primary school setting, and typically targeted social communication an d social interaction skills. This form of intervention was well supported (Reichow et al. 2010; Wang and Sp illane 2009; Wang et al. 2011), but would benefit from further research on peer selection procedures. Social skills development was the main focus of interventions which used social skills groups, social stories, and video-modelling to teach appropriate behaviours. Social skills groups were generally positive, some studies did not show str ong effects, had inconsistent results, and/or reported poor maintenance of skills (Reichow and Volkmar 2010). Th e systematic reviews identified methodological flaws in the evidence base, as trials often failed to adequately measure social skills and deficits associated with ASD, had small and poorly characterized samples, and had minimal examination of the degree to which learned skills generalize (White et al. 2009). Social skills groups generally focused on individuals with medium to higher cognitive abilities; therefore, little is known about how applicable such interventions are for individuals with lower functioning levels (Reichow and Volkmar 2010 ). Social stories showed promise as an intervention which is easy to implement, howe ver they received limited empirical support (Ospina et al. 2008). Video-modelling appears to be succe ssful in teaching target social skills, as 207well as maintaining and generalising skills to other settings (Shukla-Mehta et al. 2010; Wang and Spillane 2009; Wang et al. 2011). Overall, review authors report positively on the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions for those outcomes that were measured, with only a small number reporting negative or unclear findings. Interventions that were generally well supported include ABA, peer-training, and parent-training. Social skills training groups had mixed result s and require further research. Recent reviews of video-based and computer-based instructional interventions show promise, but further research is needed in this area to determine the best format for such interventions, and under what conditions and with which partic ipants, do these interventions work best. Studies used different outcome measures, which made comparisons difficult. There is clearly a great deal of primary research, but few of these reviews identified high-quality RCTs or Controlled Clinical Trials. The majority of in cluded studies were single-subject designs, a common design used in this area, but which provides relatively weak evidence in terms of efficacy. The range of interventions covered in the revi ews testify to the diverse range of treatment options, however ther e is little evidence of their effectivene ss, either alone or compared one with another. Implications for research A great deal of information about treatments for ASD exists, but this represents only the beginning of understanding why and how to best design interventions for children and young people with ASD. Many intervention areas have yet to be rigorously evaluated, including ecological or environmental modifications, collater al skill development, visual supports, social skills development programmes, educational programmes, and many well known manualized and comprehensive programmes. Little is known about the acc essibility, feasibility, or affordability of programmes or the cost-effectiveness of interven tions, and very little is known about the effects of intervention on parents and family well-being or the effect of treatment over the lifetime. Future research should not merely determine whet her a treatment is effective, but it must specify clearly for whom and in what context the intervention is effective. Many of the studies included in the reviews employed a single-subject research design, which, while useful, have limitations. There needs to be more research using group designs, and experimental group designs in particular, which will allow for further understanding of an intervention's effects. The results of this review woul d indicate that there is evidence of the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance the social and communication skills of children and young people with ASD, but it is not possible to draw conclusions about the superiority of one intervention over another. Future research should include direct comparisons of various types of interventions, in addition to using placebo or no treatment as comparators, in order to provide evidence that will assist patie nts and practitioners in choosing among many treatment options. The evidence-base is greatest for preschool children (typically aged <5 years), which is not surprising given the importance of early intervention. Future research should explore more the application of intervention to school-aged children and adolescents. 208Table 17.3. Description of interventions an d authors' conclusions for included reviews. Author/Year Interventions Authors' Conclusions Ayres and Langone 2005 Video-based interventions to improve: Social skills (e.g. communication and conversations skills, play, sharing, greetings) Functional skills (e.g. purchasing skills, self-care, household tasks) Studies reviewed here provide initial evidence that video based instruction can be an effective component of intervention for both social and functional skills. Bellini et al. 2007 Collateral skills (e.g. play skills, conversation skills, prosocial skills). Peer mediated - non-disabled peers are trained to direct and respond to the social behaviours of children with ASD. Child specific - involve the direct instruction of social behaviours, such as initiating and responding Comprehensive - combine 2 or more of the above intervention categories. Experimental control was demonstrated in 49 studies through the introduction or removal of the independent variable across 3 or more time points. Interventions ranged in length from 8 to 73 sessions (2.5 - 28 hours). The results support the recommendations offered by Gresham et al. (2001), which include increasing the dosage of social skills interventions, providing instruction in the child's natural setting, matching the intervention st rategy with the type of skill deficit, and ensuring intervention fidelity. Future research is needed to examine both the efficacy and the social validity of social skills interventions an d to examine factors that lead to the most beneficial outcomes for children with ASD. Delano 2007 Video-based interventions targeting one or more of the following skill areas: social communicative behaviours functional living skills answering perspective-taking questions challenging behaviours The positive outcomes of the studies reviewed suggest that video modeling interventions are important tools for practitioners, but additional research is warranted. Review is limited by the small number of studies included. Treatment effects were not measured, so it is unclear if video modeling is more or less effective than other models of instruction. Flippin et al. 2010 PECS - a behaviourally based pictorial communication system which targets expressive communication skills using reinforcement, delay and generalization across trainers and settings. The overall effectiveness of PECS for communication outcomes with children with ASD is promising, but not yet established. Evidence for effectiveness of the approach on speech outcomes is not as strong. PECS may be more beneficial for promoting speech in children with low joint attention, low motor imitation and high object exploration. Gold et al. 2010 Music therapy delivered either at home, school or at an outpatient therapy centre, on a daily basis for one week. The included studies were of limited applicability to clinical practice, but findings indicate that music therapy may help children with ASD to improve their communication stills. More research is needed to examine whether these effects are enduring, and to investigate the effects of music therapy in typical clinical practice. Howlin et al. 2009 Community-based, school-bas ed or home-based EIBI There is strong evidence that EIBI was effective for some but not all children with ASD. There is wide variability in response to treatment. Kokina and Kern 2010 Goals of interventions: Reduce inappropriate behaviours Improve appropriate social behaviours Assist in transition, novel situations, reduce anxiety Teach academic/functional skills The average intervention PND score (60%) fell below the cut-off suggested for effective interventions (70%). Social Stories had low to questionable overall effectiveness; however they were more effective when addressing inappropriate behaviours than teaching social skills. They also seemed to be more effective wh en used in general education settings and with target children as their own intervention agents. 209 Author/Year Interventions Authors' Conclusions Lee et al. 2007 7 studies used self management packages (prompts, self-monitoring and self- reinforcement) 3 studies used self-monitoring 1 study used self-reinforcement Behavioural targets: Social communication Schedule following Daily living skills Practical and social play skills Overall mean PND was 81.9%, supporting the efficacy of self-management interventions in increasing appropriate behaviours in students with ASD. Self-management methods should be given careful consideration when planning students' programs. This review made no attempt to assess the quality of studies. Machalicek et al. 2008 6 studies were instructional interv entions to teach academic skills 11 studies taught communication skills 6 studies taught functional living skills 11 studies taught play skills 12 studies taught play skills The majority of studies reported positive findings. It is impossible to draw strong conclusions regarding the comparative effectiveness of these interventions, because of the variability between studies, in terms of targeted skills, participant characteristics, instructional procedures, and magnitude of behavioural change. McConachie and Diggle 2007 Social communication parent training. Joint attention focused parent training Pivotal response training vs. individual target behaviour training Maternal psycho-educational treatment All the studies in this review have important methodological limitations, in particular, small sample sizes. However there is sufficient evidence from this review that parent training can work in terms of observed improvements in children's commu nication skills, parental performance, parent- child interactions, and reduction in parental depression. Meadan et al. 2009 Modified Incidental Te aching Sessions (MITS) Joint attention and joint engagement Imitating/ animating (I/A) and expectant waiting (EW) Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT) Pivotal Response Training (PRT) Enhanced-Milieu Teaching (EMT) Functional Communication Training PROMPT All studies reported that parents were able to learn and implement new strategies with their children in natural environments. This in turn resulted in positive changes in children's target behaviours. However there was considerable variation between interventions and methods of measuring outcomes. Further large-scale research into parent-implemented interventions is needed - these should pay attention to measures of fidelity of implementation, include populations from diverse social and cultural backgrounds, and investigate strategies that enable the generalisation of skills. Ospina et al 2008 Applied Behaviour Analysis (n=31) Communication-focused interventions (n=10), e.g. PECS, CAI, Sign Language training Integrative programs (n=14) Sensory motor interventions (n=15) Social skills development interventions (n=6) Environmental modification (n=1) ABA: Lovaas training pr oduced better outcomes on adapti ve behaviour, communication and interaction, comprehensive language, expressi ve language, daily living skills, intellectual functioning, and socialisation, compared to special education. However this is based on weak evidence, as most of the studies were of low quality. Well conducted RCTs need to be replicated to clarify the use of Lovaas intervention. Further consideration should be given to the longer term effects on family functioning and QoL. 210Author/Year Interventions Authors' Conclusions Preston and Carter 2009 PECS - a picture based system to help young children with ASD to acquire functional communication skills. The studies reviewed provide preliminary evidence that PECS may be efficacious for children with ASD, who have little or no speech. Primary benefits appear to be evident in communication by picture exchange. Research needs to determine the core aspects of the program that are important to its success, the individuals to whom it is best suit, and its relationship to other interventions. Furt her RCTs should be a research priority. Reichow and Volkmar 2010 Technological delivery, e.g. computer/videotape (n=10) Parental delivery (n=4) Non-parental adult delivery, e.g. teacher, clinician, therapist (n=26) Peer delivery-same-aged individuals tr ained to deliver intervention (n=10) Combined or multiple delivery (n=16) The methods and results of this synthesis do not permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over another to be made. No interventions for preschool-aged children or adolescents and/or adults had enough support to be considered and evidence-based practice based on the results of this review. Social skills groups for school-aged children with ASD demonstrated the evidence necessary to be considered an established evidence-based practice. Reynhout and Carter 2006 Social StoriesTM targeting: effects of Social StoriesTM is highly variable. It is uncle ar whether particular components of Social StoriesTM are central to their efficacy. Data on maintenance and generalisation are limited. Social StoriesTM are promising interventions, being relatively straightforward and efficient to implement, with application to a wide range of behaviours. Further research is needed to determine the exact nature of their contribution and components critical to their efficacy. Shukla-Mehta et al. 2010 Video-modeling alone without any additional components (n=4) Video-modeling with additional intervention components, e.g. prompts and reinforcers (n=5) Video-modeling as part of a multi-component package another intervention (n=3) Video self-modeling (n=4) Point-of-view modeling (n=2) Results from 3 of the 4 video-modeling alone studies suggest that participants not only acquired target skills, but also maintained and/or generalised the target responses to untrained people, objects and settings. Video self-modeling and point-of-view modeling resulted in increases in target behaviours and decrease in problem behaviours. Some evidence exists to support video instru ction in teaching social and communication skills to students with ASD. Future research should document the fidelity of intervention procedures, analyse the specific effects of video-modeling compared to instructor behaviours, develop a profile of participants best suited to particular inte rventions, and implement video-modeling with older children, and other cultural and language groups. Sinha et al. 2006 Auditory Integration Treatment (AIT), co nsisting of uniform treatment period for all trials, consisting of two 30 minut e sessions of music therapy per day, for 10 days. Three studies showed no benefit of AIT over control conditions. Three studies showed improvements in behaviour at 3 months, al though the outcome measure used is of questionable validity. At present, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of AIT. Spreckley and Boyd 2009 Applied Behavioural Intervention (ABI, 3 of the 4 studies used Lovaas). Duration of intervention ranged from 12 month to 48 months. Current evidence does not support the use of ABI as a superior intervention for children with ASD. Instruments used to measure change we re primarily discriminative and secondarily evaluative; these may not be able to detect low-level changes. Future research should be sufficiently powered to evaluate critical period s for intervention, the optimum intensity, and mode of delivery for achieving successful outcomes. A multi-centre RCT is essential. 211Author/Year Interventions Authors' Conclusions van Der Meer and Rispoli 2010 Operant/ behavioural instructional procedures to teach the use of SGD Staff training in SGD use The majority of studies reported improvements in the child's ability to use SGDs to communicate following intervention. An SGD has many advantages over other ACC modes of communication; in particular, it is easily used by the student and understood by others. Virues-Ortega 2010 Clinic-based intervention programs Parent-managed interventions Results suggest that long-term, comprehensive ABA intervention leads to positive medium to large effects on intellectual functioning, , language development, acquisition of daily living skills and social functionin g in children with autism. Wang and Spillane 2010 Social stories Peer mediated Video-modeling CBT Results varied widely across interventions. On ly video-modeling appeared to meet criteria for being evidence-based and effective. Social stories and peer mediated interventions also appeared to be evidence-based. Future research should target older children to determine if particular interventions are more effective with this age group. Future research should examine the generalisation of skills across multiple settings and with multiple persons. Wang et al. 2011 Peer mediated Video-modeling Both interventions were found to significantly and equally improve the social performance of children with ASD. Age functioned as a sign ificant moderator in the effectiveness of the intervention; effectiveness decreased with increasing child age. Williams-White et al. 2007 Social skills training, including: Increasing social motivation Increasing social initiations Improve appropriate social responding Reduce interfering behaviours Promote skills generalisation Group-based social skills training approaches may be useful, but this is based on evidence from several small studies. Several recommendations can be made; there is a need to develop and test structured, manual-based curricula, for replication and amenability to evaluation of treatment fidelity. Future research should use control groups with random assignment. Reliable and valid outcome measures need to be developed, or else existing tools adapted for use in the ASD population. Multi-site interventions may be needed in order to accrue adequate sample sizes. 212Table 17.4.

In this chapter, we bring together in one place the recommendations for research that have emerged from the evidence reviewed rela ting to the issues covered in this report. We begin though, by highlighting some of the issues identified by our advisory group. Issues identified by practitioners i) Our lack of knowledge as to how many children attend services, whether these are appropriate, effective and accessible, and whether or not children engage with them. ii) The significance of substance misuse and its links to mental health difficulties, though for families and young people. Both issues were thought to decrease engagement with services. iii) The high rates of mental health issues amongst looked after children., which those present thought was about two thirds, and a lack of knowledge as to how many get help, what level of help they get, and where they get it. iv) How best to identify help-seeking behaviour. v) The importance of wraparound services and supporting carers vi) Lack of knowledge about the impact of adoption, which is significantly increased over the last 10 years, with the children being adopted older and possibly more emotionally and psychologically 'damaged'. vii) The importance of knowing the features of services that work. viii) The need to give more attention to child sexual abuse. The emphasis on 'protection' needs to be matched by attention to the therapeutic needs of children who have been sexually abused. ix) The importance of retaining young people in education as a means of improving outcomes. Research gaps Chapter 3 - Northern Ireland prevalence study of mental health Clearly, all of the above have implications for a research agenda. However, those with whom we talked were unanimous in the view that the NI prevalence study of child and adolescent mental health, recommended by Bamford, needed urgently to be conducted. It was felt that there was reason to believe that Northern Ireland was sufficiently different in its history from the rest of the UK to merit such a study, and that the Meltzer study conducted in England and Wales was now over 10 years old. Some emphasised the importance of knowing how many young people in Northern Ireland are moderately and severely disturbed. Most saw it as an important prerequisite to informed planning and service development. 220Chapter 4 - Effective interventions for helping pare nts, professionals and communities to identify help-seeking behaviour Given our long-standing awareness of the under-recognition of mental health problems by young people, their parents, and professionals - particularly teachers and general practitioners -, the dearth of research in this area is stri king, particularly in relation to what might bring about change. The same is true of interventions designed to prevent or overcome the barriers to help-seeking behaviour. The singular problem of youth suicide in Northern Ireland makes this a high priority area for research. Chapter 5 - Targeting factors that contribute to poor mental health A key finding here was the need for better reporting of studies. Researchers need to detail how programmes/interventions are implemented and what their different components are, so that we can determine the extent to which effects are related to key features of the intervention or key features of the evaluation. Similarly, researchers should detail participant ch aracteristics and/or associations between such characteristics and intervention outcomes. To date, studies have lacked long-term follow-up assessments, which are key to determining how effective an intervention is in the long-term. Cost-benefit analyses have yet to be conducted, and these are particularly pressing for school anti-bullying programmes, given their widespread adoption. Finally, the views of participants have been noticeably absent for most of these stud ies, although they could be crucial in order to identify the effective components of interventions. Chapter 6 - Preventing attachment and other behavioural disorders The gaps in research vary somewhat in relation to the intervention type under consideration. In the area of parenting research, we need research that answers questions about the maintenance of gains, as most studies have only reported on short-term outcomes. To date, the evidence has little or nothing to say about whether or not parenting programmes are cost-effective as a primary prevention programme, or are best suited to secondary preventi on. In both areas, studies need to be larger and address a wider range of outcomes over a longer period of time. Given the evidence regarding the importance of the parent-infant relationship to future mental health and social adjustment, this should be a research priority. The evidence base underpinning home visiting is mixed. The programme reporting the best results to date are those of the Nurse Family Partnership (Olds 2006) and this is currently being trialled in the UK, and introduced to Northern Ireland. The evidence base is persuasive, but the evidence rests on three studies, conducted in a pol icy context quite different to that of the UK, and about which some researchers have expressed some concerns, not least of all in the lack of access to the primary data. There is a scope for the rigorous evaluation of other forms of parenting support programmes, such as that being rolled out in the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. Despite the number of reviews and studies e xploring the effectiveness of school-based programmes and interventions, further research needs to be conducted, especially longitudinal designs and good quality CCTs in the UK to assess the impact of whole-school and targeted approaches (Adi et al. 2007; Barry et al. 2009). This kind of approach is especially vulnerable to 'policy fads', and there are already indications that such interventions may no longer be a political imperative. Not to evaluate the potential of these interventions would represent a missed opportunity within the UK. Chapter 7 - Supporting carers There are few rigorous evaluati ons of parenting interventions. Research is needed to establish what programmes are best suited to support parents and carers 221from a diversity of backgrounds and different experiences, especially in the long-term, and also to determine the differential impact of interventions with mothers an d fathers. Again, studies that seriously examine the cost-effectiveness of programmes are needed. Chapter 8 - Looked after children There is still a need for studies of kinship care that succeed in better controlling the biases present in most ex isting studies. In particular, longitudinal designs that can investigate the outcomes for children over time, together with the development of psychometrically sound instruments of family and child functioning, would enable more reliable comparisons between groups and studies, and greater focus on controlling and understanding selection bias, through the application of emerging statistical models. Given the limited evidence base and the fact that most studies have been conducted by programme developers, there is a need for independent evaluation of the effectiveness of Treatment Foster Care. The English study was not well designed, and recruited few participants. Studies need to be conducted in different locati ons, with different groups of young people, of different ages and increased ethnic diversity, with a range of clearly identified problem profiles, and with follow-up components greater than two years. There is a gap in the synthesis of data from studies that have investigated interventions designed to improve the physical, educational, and mental health of LACYP. Chapter 9 - Maltreated children Gaps in research include the need i) for studies of interventions designed to address the sequaelae of child physical abuse and severe neglect, and psychological/emotional maltreatment, and ii) studies of interventions that are designed to prevent maltreatment in high-risk populations no t covered by the Nurse Family Partnership. Whilst there is a larger evidence base in relati on to promoting parental sensitivity and infant- parent attachment, there is room for more research, particularly in relation to interventions that single studies indicate are promising, but have yet to be extensively or rigorously evaluated, such as Mellow parents/Mellow Babies. More generally, there is a need for studies which: use more robust, experimental designs; provide better baseline information, including assessments of presenting problems and types of maltreatment, participants, interventions, settings, contact with other agencies, etc. provide information on co-occurrence of other types of abuse, which are commonplace, in order to enable conclusions to be drawn about the differential effectiveness of interventions for specific forms of maltreatment; track and report client attrition rates, reason s for attrition, obtain follow-up data on all participants; use a multidimensional approach to the assessment of outcomes that include behavioural observations, and collect data/conduct studies of process, to a ssess the quality of the therapeutic alliance and other key change events. Chapter 10 - Multi-agency and multi-disciplinary working We do not need any more studies of the factors hindering or facilitating multi-agency or multi-disciplinary working. We do need more studies that explore the relati ve effectiveness of different ways of working and different interventions designed to promote effective multi-agency and multi- disciplinary practice. 222Effectiveness might be defined in relation to service improvements, but there is a need for studies that focus on the end point of deliver and the difference made in the lives of children and families. Studies should include data collection strategies that shed light on the impacts of all interventions, whether these are educational, organisational or focused on fostering good working relationships. Assuming that we know something about effectiven ess, or can establish it, there is a significant gap in our knowledge of the cost-effectiveness of single agency versus multi-agency work, and different forms of these. Randomised trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series designs provide opportunities for rigorous evaluations of professional practice and healthcare outcomes. It is likely that there is a gap in research on models of practice aimed particularly at mentally ill young people and specifically at emergency or out-of-hours responses to them. Services in Northern Ireland are generally geared towards adult psychiatric care, and young people's experiences of finding themselves in hospital settings with older, often very disturbed or disabled people can have iatrogenic effects. Chapter 11 - Nurturing resilience The Penn Resiliency Programme is widely referenced as an evidenced-based programme that can make significant impacts on depression and anxiety in young people. This might be interpreted as mean ing there is no need for further research, but there is a need for independent evaluations of this programme, implemented in different policy contexts and with different populations. Its 'promise' suggests that it would be worthwhile commissioning an effectiveness trial of this programme within the UK , including Northern Ireland. This study (or studies) should be designed to answer questions about which aspects of the programme are essential to ensure optimum impact. Resilience remains a poorly understood phenomenon , and more research is needed to explore how resilience is nurtured, what threatens it, a nd how best to support individuals who are faced with extraordinary levels of assault or threat, or le vels of trauma or adversity that they are unable to manage without support. Whilst the Penn Resiliency Programme stands out for its results, it does so largely because there is a dearth of other interventions that have been developed, which enjoy a sound logic model and which have been subject to rigorous evaluation. It is unlikely that this one programme will meet all our needs, and there is a significant gap in the evidence base relating to 'what works' in promoting, sustaining, or rebuilding resilience. Making use of the influence of peers rather than professionals is an increasingly commonplace strategy in Northern Ireland. This is most evident though the use of Mentoring Schemes available through organisations including Opportunity Youth. Such strategies would benefit from high quality assessment and development. Chapter 12 - Addressing the needs of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered young people The evidence available suggests that, first and foremost, there is a significant gap in our understanding of the challenges facing children a nd young people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered. There has been little rigorous research into the nature of gender identity disorder, or what interventions are appropriate or effective. This is a significant gap in research, given the high rates of depression and suicide previously cited. While some attempts have been made at examinin g important influences on the mental health of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender young pe ople, attention should be directed towards the 223design, implementation and assessment of interventions directly aimed at these young people, focusing on the coping skills necessary to deal with minority stress, should it occur. Such research needs more carefully to document and address the diversity of participants, taking into account the varying effects that age, gender, religion, culture and ethnicity could have on mental health, and ensure these considerations are incorporated into the interventions. Research in this area, as others, needs to be more rigorous than hitherto. In particular, it should seek to move beyond convenience samples, and incorporate more prospective longitudinal work. Chapter 13 - Preventing suicide and self-harm Following Crowley et al. (2004) , our recommendations for future research are that we need to develop interventions that are conceptually and empirically sound and investigate them by means of larger trials, and studies that examine the socio-economic gradient and the wider structural barriers to mental health; process and qualitative evaluations. More particularly, we need studies of the effectiveness of helplines; means reduction, the role of media in NI context, and the responsiveness of out-of- hours and/or emergency teams. Research needs to particularly to focus on high-risk groups, the impact of self-harm, and suicide awareness training . Finally, evaluation needs to be built in to all prevention interventions. Chapter 14 - Helping parents with mental health problems In light of the current developments in Northern Ireland, and the evidence from the included reviews, priorities for research appear to be as follows. We need information on the prevalence of parental mental health problems in Northern Ireland. In light of the proposed introduction of a screening tool, there is an urgent need to evaluate possible tools on a pilot basis, befo re evaluating them more definitively. Encouraging (or insisting?) that new initiatives be subject to some form of independent evaluation from the outset, would go some considerable way to building an evidence base. This should be considered as part of the ongoing work of the Mental Health and Children's Services Project, as it works through the implementation of SCIE's (2009) guidance. There is a very significant gap in the international literature on the experiences and needs of fathers with mental health problems. Chapter 15 - Interventions for parents with mental health problems There is a predominance of interest and endeavour on early interventions. Whilst this is appropriate, it is also the case that other opportunities exist to help, and older children with parents who have mental health problems also have developmental needs that should not be ignored. Further, whilst we know that there is an association between parental mental h ealth problems and children's safety, health and well-being, the exact mechanisms involved are only partially understood - important if we are to provide effective support. More importantly, pe rhaps, we should not assume that negative consequences are inevitable, and research is therefore needed to improve decision-making. There is a need for research that directly compares various forms of treatment for parental depression, which is sufficiently well designed and powered to determine differentia l effects on children. Gunlicks et al. (2008) highlight the need for research on the effects on children of treating fathers with depression. Chapter 16 - Assertive outreach, intensive or day unit treatment The quality of studies addressing alternatives to inpatient care are highly variable and generally under powered, and the standard of reporting is poor. This has important implications for our ability to replicate those interventions that appear promising, whether in pr actice or in research. Further, the majority of the current evidence comes from studies conduc ted in the US, making it more difficult to extrapolate results to a Northern Ireland context. 224Given current concerns about the scale and management of mental health problems in children and adolescents, a high priority should be attached to improvements in the quality of the evidence base which currently provides very little guidance for the development of services. Well designed, adequately powered RCTs are needed in this area to determine which services result in the best outcomes for children and young people with complex needs, although the inherent ethical issues involved in such a study design is possibly why the evidence-base is currently so weak. Shepperd et al. (2008) make two recommendations for future research: firstly, the implementation of prospective comparative systems of audit, to include baseline measurement and demographic data at admission, along with outcomes measured using standardised robust instruments. Secondly, future studies should gather evidence from service users, their parents, and/or the professionals treating them, regarding their experiences of interventions and the difference it makes in their lives. This indicates a need for qualitative research, and/or the embedding of process and implementation data collection within effectiveness studies. Chapter 17 - Children with autistic spectrum disorders Few interventions have yet to be rigorously evaluated, including ecological or environmental modifications, collateral skill development, visual supports, social skills development programmes, educational programmes, and many well known manualized and comprehensive programmes. Little is known about the accessibility, feasibility, or affordability of pr ogrammes or the cost-effect iveness of interventions, and very little is known about the effects of interventions on parents and family well-being or the effect of treatment over the lifetime. Future research should not merely determine whether a treatment is effective, but it must specify clearly for whom and in what context the intervention is effective. There needs to be more research using group designs, and experimental group designs in particular, which will allow for further unders tanding of an interv ention's effects. The results of this review would indicate that there is much evidence to support the treatment of social and communication skills in children and young people with ASD, however it is not possible to draw conclusions about the superior ity of one intervention over another. Future research should include direct comparisons of vari ous types of interventions, in addition to using placebo or no treatment as comparators, in order to provide evidence that will assist patients and practitioners in choosing among many treatment options. The evidence-base is greatest for preschool children (typically aged <5 years), which is not surprising given the importance of early intervention. Future research should explore more the application of intervention to school-aged children and adolescents. 225APPENDIX 1: INDICATIVE SEARCH STRATEGIES14 GENERAL 1.
