Imperceptible cell dysfunction that is not corrected can lead to disease. PEMT has been used extensively for decades for many conditions and medical disciplines. PEMT works in a vast capacity helping to balance the immune system, stimulate RNA, DNA, and relax muscles. The National Institutes of Health have made PEMFs a priority for research with many PEMF devices already approved for use by the FDA. Additional benefits of PEMT include reduction and improvement of specific conditions: - Pain - Inflammation - Effects of stress on the body - Platelet adhesion Improves: - Energy - Circulation - Blood and tissue oxygenation - Sleep quality - Blood pressure - Cholesterol levels - Uptake of nutrients - Cellular detoxification - Regeneration of cells - Accelerated repair of bone and soft tissue How do PEMF's work? Science teaches us that everything is energy and all energy is electromagnetic in nature. All atoms, chemicals, and cells produce electromagnetic fields (EMFs). Science has proven every organ in the body produces its own signature bio electromagnetic field and that all 70 trillion cells in the body communicate via electromagnetic frequencies. Electromagnetic energy controls chemistry, which in turn controls tissue function. Disruption of electromagnetic energy in cells causes impaired cell metabolism, whatever the initial cause. This happens anywhere in the disease process. And, when the electromagnetic activity of the body ceases, life ceases. PEMFs address impaired chemistry and thus the function of cells. As they pass through, they stimulate most of the electrical and chemical processes in the tissues. Therapeutic PEMFs are specifically designed to positively support cellular energy, resulting in better cellular health and function. Good vs. Evil in the Universe of EMF's There is a form of pollution referred to as \"electro-smog\" and is disruptive to cell metabolism. Electro smog and/or \"dirty\" electricity, emits from manmade, unnatural EMF's. These emissions come from our everyday creature comforts that surround us such as power lines, communication towers, cell phones, computers, TV's, microwave ovens, hair dryers, fluorescent lighting and so much more. Electro-smog can drain our energy and is powerful stress inducer in our bodies. Unfortunately, it can be only partially blocked because it's quite literally, everywhere. Decreasing exposure is our only option. With therapeutic PEMF's we can purposely add beneficial balancing frequencies to our body and decrease the negative effects of electro-smog. PEMF and Magnet Therapies - the Difference PEMFs are frequency-based, applied to either the whole body or parts of the body. PEMFs may only be needed for short periods of time, while the effects last for many hours, setting in motion cellular and whole-body changes to restore and maintain balance in metabolism and health. The body does not acclimate, or \"get used to,\" the healthy energy signals of therapeutic PEMFs, even if used for a long time, compared to magnets. Stationary (or \"static\"), non-varying, magnetic fields from magnets have fixed strengths. They are used in mattresses, bracelets, knee wraps and the like. Most have very shallow penetration into the body, resulting in a very limited ability to affect deeper tissues, and they rarely treat all the cells of the body simultaneously. Only skilled practitioners may guide you to get the best results from these approaches. Dr. Blosiu specializes in treating the symptoms of arthritis and nerve pain with gentle, space age, non-invasive techniques that reduce inflammation, congestion, and naturally accelerate healing without negative side effects. He employs both traditional physical therapy techniques and advanced FDA approved protocols. Those include utilizing Low Level Light Therapy, Frequency Specific Microcurrent, Dry Heat Therapy, and Pulsed Electromagnetic Therapy.
