Schaefer 330 FROM OUR READERS ON THE COVER: Illustration by Kathy Kostek. News and Comment Row Over Sargent's Psi Experiments Erupts With Evidence of Carelessness and Cheating BEGINNING almost ten years ago, a series of reports of highly success\u00ad ful ganzfeld psi experiments began ema\u00ad nating from the University of Cambridge laboratory of Carl Sargent. They quickly became a significant part of the case for scientific evidence of psi, or extrasensory perception. These experiments, and Sargent him\u00ad self, who holds a Ph.D. in parapsy\u00ad chology from Cambridge, are now the subject of a bitter controversy. The dis\u00ad pute concerns newly published observa\u00ad tions by psychologist Susan Blackmore that call Sargent's experimental proce\u00ad dures into serious question and cast doubt on the validity of his results. This is the second major controversy to break out over the experimental methods used in ganzfeld experiments. Earlier, University of Oregon psychologist Ray Hyman\u2014like Blackmore, a respected and well-informed critic of parapsy\u00ad chology\u2014published a lengthy critique of the entire ganzfeld data base, pointing out serious weaknesses (see SI, Fall 1985, for a summary). But the Sargent dispute has recently become somewhat more hostile, perhaps because Blackmore raises the possibility of fraud in Sargent's case. In November 1979, Blackmore, now with the Brain and Perception Labora\u00ad tory at the University of Bristol, was engaged in parapsychological research herself (see her article about these experi\u00ad ences, \"The Elusive Open Mind,\" SI, Spring 1987) and went to visit Sargent's Cambridge laboratory. Although Sargent had been getting highly successful results in ganzfeld experiments, in superficially similar experiments at the University of Surrey Blackmore had been unsuccessful. She wanted to observe his methods and conditions and compare them with her own to learn the reasons for the discre\u00ad pancy in results. Sargent invited Blackmore to come for a month. She received a grant from the Society for Psychical Research (SPR) but was permitted to stay only eight days. During the visit she observed flaws in the way Sargent's research protocol was observed and in the randomization pro\u00ad cedures, although the source of these errors wasn't apparent. Blackmore wrote up a report of her observations and concerns for the SPR, available to interested persons on request. Since then, an internal row has taken place over Sargent's unwillingness to re\u00ad spond to requests from the Parapsy\u00ad chological Association (PA) for data from the experiments to confirm or deny Blackmore's charges. The PA then cen\u00ad sured Sargent for his refusal. This led John Beloff, editor of the British Journal of the Society for Psy\u00ad chical Research (JSPR), and Blackmore to make Blackmore's 1979 report public. It was published, in slightly amended form, in JSPR's July 1987 issue (54, no. 808: 186-198), and was followed in the same issue by a vitriolic response from Sargent and another from two of Sar- 226 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER I-*-\"****^. tp-*\u00abm. by colleagues in the experiments. In the following issue, Blackmore responds to some of their criticisms. Ganzfeld experiments are based on the idea that psi, or ESP, is more likely to occur when a subject is totally relaxed and deprived of sensory input. In the experiments, the subject lies down and half of a ping-pong ball is placed over each eye and affixed with cotton and tape. White noise is played through head\u00ad phones. An experimenter watches through a oneway mirror from an adja\u00ad cent control room, listening to and re\u00ad cording the subject's statements. At an agreed-upon time an \"agent\" at another location then concentrates on\u2014in the sessions observed by Black- more\u2014one of four pictures selected from one of 27 randomly selected sets of four pictures. The agent tries to \"send\" im\u00ad pressions of the image to the subject by telepathy. Immediately afterward, the experi\u00ad menter and the subject examine a dupli\u00ad cate set of four pictures and together judge and rank their degree of correspon\u00ad dence with the subject's recorded impres\u00ad sions. Each is rated on a scale of 1 to 99 and ranked 1 to 4. This is then compared with the actual picture the agent was looking at to see whether the result is a hit or miss. During Blackmore's visit to Sargent's lab, three ganzfeld experiments were in progress. She observed 12 experimental sessions at the lab and another at a pri\u00ad vate home. Of the 12 conducted in the laboratory the success rate expected by chance was 25 percent. There were 6 direct hits, for a hit rate of 50 percent, which seemed to confirm Sargent's pre\u00ad vious high scoring rates. All sorts of elaborate procedures sup\u00ad posedly protected the randomization and envelope-selection processes. But Black- more found some disturbing flaws in the way they were conducted. She hypothesized a number of sce\u00ad narios, other than psi, that might account for the positive results and then pro\u00ad ceeded to look for evidence for them. Several had to do with improper handling of the sealed envelopes containing the letters A to D to select the pictures. For instance, the main pile of envelopes might be marked, or be partly replaced, or be biased by several methods. If cheating with the envelopes were taking place, one might expect envelopes to disappear from Spring 1988 227 Notes and Comments on a Year Of Expansion and Growth By several measures this has been one of the best years ever for the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. We have in\u00ad creased the size of the magazine, and we have tried to be more topical. We are publishing substantive evaluations of some of the subjects most in the popular consciousness. We've had 11 years of steady growth in circulation, but this past year was the best yet. The number of paid subscribers rose 25 per\u00ad cent, from 28,000 to 35,000. (We wel\u00ad come all you new readers.) Even we were surprised by this. When compared with supermarket tab\u00ad loids, our readership is of course small, but it compares favorably with some very distinguished and important scien\u00ad tific and scholarly publications. That class of publications, I hope you will agree, is more in keeping with our ap\u00ad proach if not always our achievement. Actually we are an unusual hybrid: part semipopular magazine, part scien\u00ad tific and scholarly journal. I think it's fair to say that we not only help to cross disciplinary barriers within scien\u00ad tific fields but bridge the gaps between the \"hard\" and \"soft\" sciences, between science and the humanities, between academics and nonacademics, and be\u00ad tween science and the general public. Expertise is where you find it, and no part of society has a monopoly. We seek it out and welcome it, from who\u00ad ever has a willingness to participate and a concern about the public-education issues we address. The readers are the beneficiaries. Two wholly unexpected phenomena have arisen in conjunction with the growth of CSICOP and the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. One is the rapid formation of inter\u00ad national, regional, and local groups in\u00ad spired by CSICOP. No one anticipated that in virtually every region of the United States people would form their own groups to address the same kinds of issues at the local level. These groups are totally autonomous and have no official or legal connection with CSICOP. They are involving thousands of people in an effort to critically ex\u00ad amine paranormal and fringe-science claims promulgated in their own cities and states. A number publish excellent newsletters. Laser, by the Southern California Skeptics, and BASIS, by the Bay Area Skeptics, are two of the more notable, but there are others. If you are not already involved with a group in your area, you might wish to seek it out. (See the ever-expanding list at the back of this and every SI issue.) National and regional groups in other countries have likewise mush\u00ad roomed. When the CSICOP Executive Council met in Toronto in November, it participated in a luncheon meeting with the Ontario Skeptics. This group didn't even exist a year or so ago. Near\u00ad ly 200 people came to the meeting, and there were prominent news articles in 228 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER the two Toronto daily newspapers. At last count, outside the United States there were 26 groups in 16 countries, with others in the process of formation. Several of these groups also publish their own newsletters. A notable new one, the British & Irish Skeptic, bridges national and group boundaries. The SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, by the way, now goes to 55 countries, and we are actively working to increase its visibility in Europe and elsewhere. The second phenomenon is the de\u00ad mand for back issues of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. When people discover us, they want to see what we've published in the past. Almost everyone requests some back issues, and many order the entire set (now totalling 42). This in\u00ad tense interest and support is very heartening. Virtually alone among magazines I know, the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER keeps every back issue in print. This isn't easy. In 1987 alone, 17 of our previous issues had to be re\u00ad printed to meet this demand. People appear to recognize that our back issues constitute a valuable body of evaluative material about all manner of topics. (No, we haven't covered everything, and we never expect to run out of subjects.) As a result of this interest, we are very pleased that the ten-year index of the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER has now fin\u00ad ally been published. There have been earlier, less ambitious indexes, but this one is by far the best yet. I think you will find it very useful. It covers every\u00ad thing published in the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER (even letters to the editor!) from 1976 to 1986, volume 1 through volume 10. It is 101 pages long and is nicely printed in the same page size as the magazine. Its subject index is exten\u00ad sive (74 printed pages), with hundreds of entries both specific (Afghanistan Triangle, Project Grillflame, Psychic Warfare, Thoughtography) and general (Education, Paranormal Phenomena, Pseudoscience, Skepticism). There is also an author index (approximately 450 names) and an index of book re\u00ad views by title (127 books), author, and reviewer. Look for an announcement elsewhere in this issue of how to obtain this handy supplement to your back issues. Also available are two books of SKEPTICAL INQUIRER articles, arranged by subject. The first, Paranormal Bor\u00ad derlands of Science, includes selections from 1976 to 1981; the second, Science Confronts the Paranormal, from 1981 to 1985. Obtain these from the pub\u00ad lisher, Prometheus Books, in Buffalo. We are also pleased to report the publication in India of a book consist\u00ad ing of SKEPTICAL INQUIRER articles along with other articles from the writ\u00ad ings of Indian scientists and thinkers. The book, Science, Nonscience, and the Paranormal, was edited by Dr. H. Nar- asimhaiah, former vice-chancellor of Bangalore University, and published by the Bangalore Science Forum, which he founded. Scientists and scholars in India requested that CS1COP permit publication of the articles to assist in their effort to propagate a scientific atti\u00ad tude among the populace. \u2014Kendrick Frazier, EDITOR Spring 1988 229 the drawers where they were kept during, rather than after, a session, or that more than one envelope was used for each session. No marking or switching was ob\u00ad served, but Blackmore did discover a bias (that favored a positive result) in the main pile of envelopes as well as errors in the drawers. Extra envelopes were also found around the room. She also had observed during one trial that Sargent, although not officially tak\u00ad ing part in the session, did the random\u00ad ization. He also came in during the judg\u00ad ing and seemed to influence the subject to judge favorably the picture that was in fact the correct choice. \"He seemed to push the subject toward picture B,\" she reports. B was the one the agent had been \"transmitting.\" Blackmore reports that when she and Sargent's colleague Trevor Harley pre\u00ad sented him with these disclosures, Sargent denied that any of the errors were de\u00ad liberate. He gave alternative explanations. She asked him to write his own account to explain them, but he never did so. Blackmore summarizes: \"I had pre\u00ad dicted that certain methods of cheating would lead to a bias in the main pile. 1 found that bias.\" (Sargent said the errors were accidental.) \"I had predicted that certain methods of cheating would necessitate having extra piles of envelopes hidden around the room. These were found.\" (Sargent ex\u00ad plained that they were left over from a previous experiment.) Furthermore, she says, in one session \"Sargent did the randomization when he should not have. A 'B' went missing from the drawer during the session, instead of afterwards. Sargent came into the judging and 'pushed' the subject towards 'B.' An error of addition was made in favor of 'B' and 'B' was chosen. 'B' was the target and the session a direct hit.\" Says Blackmore in her JSPR report: \"The hypothesis of cheating led to the discovery of errors. It explains them fairly neatly and could, if extrapolated to the whole experiment, account for the large effects observed.\" The alternative hy\u00ad pothesis, she says, \"would imply a good deal of carelessness in the running of the experiment.\" Nevertheless, she says, \"I considered that the evidence was not conclusive in favor of either hypothesis and that more evidence was needed.\" She proposed she make further observations to double-check these hypotheses but Sargent refused her further access. It was agreed that both Blackmore and Sargent would write up for the SPR archives their versions of the experiments she observed. Blackmore did; Sargent did not. Blackmore proposed still further ways to test the hypotheses and potentially lift the implications of cheating. These re\u00ad quired Sargent's raw data. \"I kept hoping that this would happen and the truth would become clearer,\" she writes. \"However, Sargent refused to make this data available.\" In 1984, the PA Council asked Martin Johnson to head a committee to investi\u00ad gate the case. Its report reprimanded Sargent for failing to respond to the committee's request for information in a reasonable time. \"I still think there is doubt as to the correct hypothesis,\" Blackmore empha\u00ad sizes in her published report. \"However, any hope that this will be speedily re\u00ad solved now seems to be unrealistic. I am therefore presenting the evidence I have, as accurately as possible.\" The significance of it all? Blackmore points out that there has recently been considerable controversy surrounding the value of the ganzfeld data base in providing evidence for psi. \"The many experiments involving Sargent as experimenter form a very substantial and important proportion of that data base.\" She points out that according to Ray Hyman, in his 1985 critique in the Journal of Parapsychology (49:3-49), Sargent's nine studies and Charles 230 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Honorton's five account for one-third of the total. Also, according to Honorton, in an article in the same issue of JP as Hyman's, Sargent's experiments have the second highest effect size, after Honor- ton's own, and \"if Sargent's findings were removed from this data base it would be considerably weakened as evidence for psi.\" Sargent lashes out at Blackmore in his article of response, which he titles, \"Sceptical Fairytales from Bristol.\" He attacks her reliability and integrity and says she committed errors of both com\u00ad mission and omission. He claims her \"fraud\" hypothesis isn't a hypothesis at all because \"it can explain anything.\" Later he says, \"My counterhypothesis is simply that Blackmore observed certain trivial and random errors and then made up hypotheses to go with them.\" Sargent (who is no longer at Cam\u00ad bridge University) says: \"I don't care whether people think I'm a fraud or not, but object very strongly to anyone believ\u00ad ing that I might be a stupid one. . . . She merely capitalized on random and trivial errors and built a fairytale around them.\" He further claims that Blackmore's idea that reanalysis could determine the root of the errors \"is just nonsense and readers should not be misled by this claim.\" He concludes: \"I'm not spending decades defending my results against ever-changing, ever-reformulated re- analyses. You can never beat the fraud hypothesis [his emphasis]; it is totally unfalsifiable and letting oneself in for this kind of business is a form of masochism I'm not partial to. I stand by all the data reported; it is a matter of utter indiffer\u00ad ence to me whether Blackmore or anyone else in parapsychology believes me or not.\" Incredibly\u2014and probably embar\u00ad rassingly to parapsychologists striving to bring more scientific rigor to the field\u2014 he then suggests that personal experience is superior to data in evaluating claims. \"I know the results were real because I was there and my experience [his empha\u00ad sis] tells me so. If I learned one thing in parapsychology, it is that results and data never changed anyone's mind about any\u00ad thing; experience is the only arbiter.\" Blackmore told the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, \"I thought many of Sargent's criticisms were misguided.\" She says she finds Harley's response altogether \"more rational and well argued.\" But she chal\u00ad lenges their point about the supposed nonutility of her cheating hypothesis. \"Yes, I could have gone on thinking up methods forever and so make it untest- able. But I didn't have to. I came up with several quite clear predictions and some of them were confirmed. So it seems pointless to argue that the hypothesis is useless.\" Sargent's final words\u2014in his pub\u00ad lished response\u2014are indeed final. He makes it plain he will cooperate not at all in any further resolution of the matter: \"I do not intend to, and I shall not, address this issue again.\" We are left to our own judgments. \u2014Kendrick Frazier Church Decision Leaves Shroud-Test Plans in Disarray FOR A TIME it looked as though research protocols had been reached that would allow samples of the Shroud of Turin to be radiocarbon dated in a thoroughly scientific manner. Seven re\u00ad spected scientific laboratories in the United States and Europe had planned to do independent dating tests on the shroud samples, and secret research pro\u00ad tocols had been worked out in the meet\u00ad ings of researchers and church repre\u00ad sentatives. Then came word in November that the church had changed the agreed-upon ground rules. Archbishop Anastasio Ballestrero of Turin informed the scien- Spring 1988 231 tists that only three of the laboratories could conduct the tests. The labs are the University of Arizona, Oxford University in Britain, and the Technical University of Zurich. Dropped from the list were Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York; the University of Rochester; Saclay Laboratory in France; and the Atomic Energy Research Authority in Harwell, Britain. Garman Harbottle, a senior chemist at Brookhaven, said the scientists in\u00ad volved were \"thunderstruck\" at the church decision not to follow the research protocol. He called the limitation a seri\u00ad ous problem. \"What if you have three labs doing it and one of them comes out one thousand years different?\" Harbottle told Newsday. \"What do you do? Average all three? Take two and throw out the one? You just throw up your hands.\" Professor Harry E. Gove of the Uni\u00ad versity of Rochester's Nuclear Structure Research Laboratory was equally indig\u00ad nant. Having only three labs test such a controversial object is scientifically risky, he said. \"Once in a while, you'll get a really bad number,\" he told the Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle. \"If that happens with six or seven labs, you can handle it.\" But if you get discrepant figures from one of only three labs, \"it will be a can of worms. No result you get after that will ever be convincing.\" Gove speculated: \"It's almost as if they [church officials] want it to be done in a questionable manner.\" The scientists said the archbishop gave no satisfactory reason for the changes in the agreement. He mentioned a need to conserve the shroud material. \"That does not seem to be a reasonable or plausible reason for reducing the number of labs,\" said Harbottle. \"The amount of cloth to be taken was minuscule.\" The tests use a new counting method that uses accelerator mass spectroscopy to separate and count the individual carbon-14 nuclei within a sample, a method that allows much smaller samples to be radiocarbon dated than earlier carbon-14 dating techniques. Two postage-stamp-sized pieces of the shroud linen would provide sufficient material for all seven research groups. Another issue: The archbishop's letter did not spell out procedures for ensuring that the shroud samples could not be tampered with. The original research plan had called for representatives of the Brit\u00ad ish Museum, the Vatican, and the Arch\u00ad bishop of Turin to monitor the collection, distribution, and testing of the shroud samples. Even the labs that were selected were not happy. Paul E. Damon of the Uni\u00ad versity of Arizona said he and his col\u00ad leagues have expressed concerns about reducing the number of labs to three. \"There will be skepticism over the results no matter what we do. But limiting the number of labs will only assure more skepticism. We want to minimize the doubts about the shroud results, not in\u00ad crease them.\" He said Zurich and Oxford also expressed concerns. \"We have basically said we are honored to be chosen but that we prefer to go back to the original plan for dating the shroud,\" Damon said in an Asso\u00ad ciated Press dispatch. \"The whole issue is under active discussion now.\" In January, Gove and Harbottle held a news conference at Columbia University to protest the decision to limit the test to three laboratories. They pointed to the danger of having too few analyses, in case one of the labs makes a serious error\u2014as happened in an earlier test run. The same day, CSICOP, in support of their complaint, sent telegrams to the selected laboratories asking them to re\u00ad fuse to take part in the test unless the church authorities agree to include the other laboratories and to restore the scientific protocol protecting the chain of evidence. \u2014Kendrick Frazier 232 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Chinese 'UFO Sighting' Part of Japanese Launch ASPECTACULAR light show in the evening skies over Shanghai, China, on August 27, 1987, widely reported by the U.S. news media as a UFO, was identified by an investigator for CSICOP as part of a Japanese satellite launch. James E. Oberg, an aerospace en\u00ad gineer at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, and a member of CSICOP's UFO Subcommittee, reported that the visual apparition was nothing more than excess fuel dumped from the second-stage booster rocket of the Japanese launch. According to the Chinese news agency Xin Hua, residents of Shanghai got their first visit from a UFO as a number of witnesses claimed to have seen a bright object pass over the city. Quoting de\u00ad scriptions of observers that it was like \"a comet with a tail like an umbrella\" and like a \"flying orange\" that traveled clock\u00ad wise and eastward, the news agency left little doubt that something strange had occurred. Oberg became interested when he learned that an account of the sighting had been broadcast by ABC News on the night of August 28. Stories on the sight\u00ad ing were subsequently carried by both the Associated Press and United Press International wire services. Based on the descriptions given, Oberg noted the marked similarity to a number of past UFO sightings that were later revealed to be space projects originating from Earth. One that occurred in mid-August 1986 led to what has been dubbed \"The Great East Coast UFO.\" (See Oberg's article in SI, Winter 1986-87.) In this sighting a bright cloudlike UFO appeared in the eastern sky and was visible throughout virtually the entire eastern section of North America. \"In the Chinese case, we have a com\u00ad plete correlation of the sighting with the second launching of a new-model Japa\u00ad nese rocket called the H-l,\" stated Oberg. \"The first launch of the H-l occurred, not surprisingly, on August 12, 1986. Several hours after launch, while releasing excess propellant, it drifted across the eastern half of North America.\" According to Oberg, the second launch of the H-l occurred at approxi\u00ad mately 9:20 (0920) Greenwich Time on August 27. It was conducted by the Japanese National Space Development Agency (NASDA) from the Tanegashima Space Center on Kyushu Island. Using data provided by the Space Surveillance Center of the U.S. Space Command, which tracks all objects in orbit around the earth, Oberg was able to pinpoint the path of the H-l. Three hours after liftoff, on the second pass around the earth, while the booster was spewing a very thin but large cloud of leftover fuel, the H-I crossed the so-called terminator line, or the daylight/darkness line. At this point, objects in the sky may be visible to people on the ground because of sun\u00ad light being reflected off of them, even though the ground itself may be covered UFO over Shanghai flying object IUFOI ovar Tba UFO WM Whan an lea oajtaerita eoOJdea with mataora b tha aky. tha Inwnatm friction general** bant and light.

Citing such factors as the launch time, the location, and the altitude of a satellite, Oberg noted that it is only a matter of coincidence where a satellite, or fuel cloud, will cross the terminator line and become visible from the earth. Such sightings are not uncommon and have led to past UFO panics in South Amer\u00ad ica, the Middle East, China, North America, and the Soviet Union. Failure of Avalanche Dowsing In Controlled Tests in Norway NORWEGIANS are said to be born with skis on their feet. The week before Easter, the cities empty. With warmer and longer days, Norwegians go to the mountains for cross-country skiing. Naturally, mountain safety is important, and the Norwegian Red Cross Mountain Rescue has 5,000 volunteer guards on duty during the peak skiing season. Compared with the alpine countries of Central Europe, avalanche accidents are fairly rare in Norway. The Red Cross nevertheless educates the public in ava\u00ad lanche safety and trains its members in avalanche rescue. Before Easter 1986, I came across a newspaper article about the Red Cross's advocacy of dowsing for finding ava\u00ad lanche victims. It turns out that this has 234 been the case for more than ten years and that the Norwegian Army officially advocates the method. The experience from real accidents was poor, however. At an avalanche in early March 1986, dowsing was tried in an area where seven or eight soldiers were later found dead. The dowser, an Army captain, got 20 to 30 \"registrations.\" Of these, only one was correct. The lack of any credible success with this method led the Army to under\u00ad take tests in May 1987. As the instigator of a public controversy over this use of dowsing, I was invited to take part as an observer. Three \"expert\" dowsers from the Red Cross, a \"scientific consultant\" to that organization in matters of dowsing, and two teams of soldiers who had received a few hours of training were to test their abilities. In the first test, which was per\u00ad formed six times, the four \"experts\" were to find a soldier \"buried\" at a random position in a snow wall. The probability for a chance hit was 10 percent. Of 24 registrations, 5 were judged hits\u2014some\u00ad what more than the probable result of 2 or 3, but still too few to be statistically significant. The number in no way ap\u00ad proached the 80 to 90 percent success rate predicted by believers. In the second test, performed three times, a soldier was \"buried\" under 2 meters of snow in a field approximately 50 meters square and with a probability of a chance hit of 1 percent. Again, 24 registrations were made (multiple regi\u00ad strations were permitted). On the average, the target was missed by 19 meters, the closest registration being 5.1 meters away. It may be added that the \"experts\" per\u00ad formed as poorly as the inexperienced soldiers. There was strict control to en\u00ad sure that no extraneous information was supplied to the dowsers. In fact, no one involved knew the outcome until all tests were completed. How did avalanche dowsing become accepted by the Army and the Red Cross? The main factor seems to have been the THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER forceful personality of Nils Faarlund, an engineer and an accomplished mountain- climber who runs a school specializing in outdoor life and wilderness survival. Faarlund represents the Red Cross inter\u00ad nationally in mountain rescue work and has been a consultant in these matters to the Army. The Army unit in charge of the tests has concluded that avalanche dowsing should be discontinued. The Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, which is in charge of avalanche research in Norway and also took part in the tests, has warned against such dowsing for several years. As of this writing (October 1987) the Red Cross has taken no official stand. Faarlund still claims that dowsing is a valid tool of \"integrated and balanced rescue service\" but admits now that the technique is not \"fully developed.\" \u2014Rolf Marine Rolf Marine is professor of theoretical chemistry at the University of Bergen, Norway, and a member of the Swedish organization Vetenskap och Folkbildning, patterned after CSICOP. Science Center Helps Students Separate Science, Pseudoscience OUR WORLD is filled with deci\u00ad sions. As Larry White, director of the Needham Science Center, which serves 2,000 elementary school children in Needham, Massachusetts, points out, many decisions are relatively unimpor\u00ad tant, while others affect us for a lifetime. Some decisions, he notes, relate to our beliefs in the fringe areas of science\u2014 astrology, mind-power, ESP, witchcraft. The media and the movies constantly bombard us with the \"pro\" side of such subjects, he points out. Seldom do we hear the \"con\" side. \"It is simply not as much fun!\" To find out what children really be\u00adlieve about such matters, White and his colleagues last March asked the fourth- grade students in Needham to answer a series of 40 true or false statements. The results show that children do look cri\u00ad tically at the world of questionable science. A majority of the children do not believe in sea monsters, crystal balls, the reality of vampires, psychic metal- bending, or that plants feel pain. But a majority do believe in palm readers, that dreams foretell the future, and that four- leaf clovers bring good luck. Probably the most interesting part of this project is not the survey and its results but the responses the Science Center prepared for each statement. Teachers had asked for information they could share with students concerning the various controversial beliefs. The result is a compendium of short, clear answers to the very questions posed earlier to the students. These answers \"reflect the positions held by most responsible scientists throughout the world,\" says the Center's summary. \"All of the responses can be backed with published scientific data which has been adapted to a fourth grade comprehension level.\" Here are two examples: \"Some people can read other people's minds. Magicians say emphatically 'No.' All of the 'Mind Readers' and 'Mentalists' we see in theaters and on TV use trick methods well known to professional magicians. The few 'Mind Readers' who have submitted to laboratory tests have either failed miserably or have been caught cheating when magicians were part of the testing team.\" \"// is possible to really hypnotize a person. Hypnotism is recognized as a sci\u00ad ence by doctors, dentists, and psychi\u00ad atrists around the world. Courses in hyp\u00ad notism are given in reputable universities around the world.\" (Not all the answers, as you can see, are negative. A second Q/A notes that it is true that a hypno- Spring 1988 235 tized person can be made to feel no pain.) The goal of the Science Center, estab\u00ad lished in 1964, is to make science come alive for young students and provide enrichment experiences not possible in the typical classroom. It is locally funded and part of the Needham public school system. In 1983 it won an \"Excellence in Science Education\" award from the National Science Teachers Association. White says his dual interests in science and magic (he's a member of the Society of American Magicians) accounts for his interest in young people's beliefs in pseu- doscience. The first such survey was done ten years ago and resulted in Needham adding units on superstition and pseudo- science to the schools' science curriculum. The survey package is made available to teachers and has resulted in thought- provoking classroom discussions and debates. \"It has stimulated wonderful dis\u00ad cussions and, with my magic interests, some great demonstrations of 'strange happenings,' \" says White. \"We hope to create the skeptics of tomorrow by [teaching students] to sift facts and weigh evidence. Perhaps such skills will find practical use when our young people are faced with more serious questions.\" I or further information about this interesting program contact White at Needham Science Center, Needham Pub\u00ad lic Schools, 1155 Central Ave., Needham, MA 02192. \u2014K.F. New Zealanders Pledge $10,000 For Paranormal Demonstration THE NEW Zealand Skeptics has an\u00ad nounced that if anyone can display a paranormal ability under controlled conditions the group will donate $10,000 to a church or charity of the claimant's choice. The chairman of the group, Dr. Denis Dutton, said he was disappointed that previous offers of rewards in other coun\u00ad tries had revealed few self-proclaimed psychics who were willing to put their powers to the test. \"The proponents of the paranormal have replied that true psychics will never abuse their spiritual gifts by performing for personal gain,\" Dutton said. \"We agree that these are worthy sentiments, so now we are giving them a chance to perform for a charity.\" Dutton said that he, the Skeptics' secretary, Dr. Chris Connolly, and the group's treasurer, Professor B. H. Howard, are offering the money out of their own pockets. They are especially interested in attracting practitioners of telepathy, clairvoyance, telekinesis, medi- umship, psychic surgery, and levitation. In order to obtain release of the cash award, the paranormal claimant must pass a controlled test. \"The controls are not designed to make the demonstration difficult,\" Dutton explained. \"They only make it impossible to cheat.\" Connolly said that he knew some people sincerely believed they had para\u00ad normal powers and he hoped they would come forward. But he warned those who were not genuine that the New Zealand Skeptics were well equipped to spot self- delusion and outright fakery. In addition to scientists, academics, medical doctors, and other interested members of the pub\u00ad lic, the Skeptics include in their ranks experienced stage magicians. \"Our former chairman, David Marks, caught Uri Geller cheating when he vis\u00ad ited New Zealand,\" Connolly said. \"We know all self-styled clair\u00ad voyants from overseas. . . . No one will be able to impress us with information secretly transmitted by accomplices.\" Connolly added that the Skeptics doubt all paranormal claims only because there has as yet been no good evidence for them. \"Even the apparently most plausible claims in the past have eventu\u00ad ally been shown to be mistaken,\" he said. 236 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER \"We would be delighted to discover someone who could demonstrate genuine paranormal powers. It would be well worth our $10,000.\" A four-page protocol for laboratory investigation of paranormal claims has been made available. It outlines general procedures for protecting against sensory cues and fraud, for formalized random\u00ad ization, for keeping accurate and com\u00ad plete records, and for statistical analysis of results. All experimental conditions are to be specified and agreed upon by all parties in advance. The $10,000 award for a designated charity is available to New Zealand resi\u00ad dents who are able to demonstrate psy\u00ad chic, telepathic, or other paranormal powers in New Zealand. Dutton said he \"found it frustrating that paranormal abilities can easily be summoned for a $35 'psychic reading' and yet always strangely seem to evaporate in the face of a request to put them to a controlled test.\" \"Maybe this offer will bring out sin\u00ad cere persons who claim to have para\u00ad normal abilities,\" Dutton said. The Sedona Vortices: Light, Vision, and Grandeur DURING THE weekend of August 16, 1987, the town of Sedona, Arizona, braced itself for a predicted invasion of 40,000 members of the \"meta\u00ad physical community\" seeking renewed energy from the so-called vortices, five of which are said to exist in the Sedona area. The worldwide Harmonic Con\u00ad vergence predicted for that time (5/, Winter 1987-88) was supposed to enhance the efficacy of the vortices. Sedona has a population of about 10,000, mostly affluent retirees, and is set in surroundings of spectacular beauty in the mountain foothills of central Arizona. Some 2.5 million tourists pass through Sedona each year, but the locals were apprehensive about an additional Spring 1988 40,000 showing up all at once. Their concerns were largely practical, not meta\u00ad physical, consisting of worries about environmental impacts, trash, litter, and sanitation. Otherwise the locals viewed the visitors with amused tolerance, some\u00ad times referring to them as \"40,000 har\u00ad monica players,\" or \"moronic con\u00ad vergers,\" the latter being a term orig\u00ad inated by the cartoonist Gary Trudeau. As it turned out, the fears were groundless. Only about 3,000 showed up, just a small bump on the peak of normal summertime weekend tourist traffic. The visitors were quiet and well behaved. Local merchants who expected a bonanza were disappointed, but purveyors of crystals, vortex maps, and the like, did a land-office business. There are perhaps a couple of hun\u00ad dred believers who are permanent resi\u00ad dents of Sedona. Their needs are served by several shops selling metaphysical literature and materials. They have meet\u00ad ings, lectures, and symposia, some with a substantial number of out-of-town participants. This reporter drives past one 237 of the vortex locations several times daily, and I usually see several cars parked there. From observation of the cars' oc\u00ad cupants and the crowds attending the meetings, the believers are largely middle- class, middle-aged females. A considera\u00ad ble number are believers in unorthodox and nontraditional medical practices, and many are UFO enthusiasts. From the vortex literature, it is im\u00ad possible to get a rational explanation of the phenomena. It describes the beneficial effects as being the result of electric and magnetic fields, but then defines and describes these fields in ways that make no sense whatever in terms of conven\u00ad tional physical theory as it is generally known today. But in the middle of this bowl of what can charitably be described as mush, there may be some grains of truth. If you sit quietly and meditatively in the vicinity of one of the vortices, you are in a spot of awesome scenic grandeur \u2014in nature's cathedral\u2014and it is very likely that you will leave with a sense of peaceful well-being, both mental and physical. There is an overwhelming visual impact. Since it is well established that visible light consists of electromagnetic waves, it can be concluded that the vortex be\u00ad lievers probably experience a real effect, which is triggered by a well-known elec\u00ad tromagnetic process (visible light), and no metaphysical explanation is needed to understand it. \u2014Harner Selvidge Harner Selvidge is a former electrical- engineering professor and instrumenta\u00ad tion researcher who is now an aviation consultant and author. From his tower office on Sedona's mountaintop airport, he can look down with a skeptical eye on the vortices below, and on the UFOs above. Court Rules Channeler Guilty AMONTREAL court recently found a channeler guilty of illegally prac\u00ad ticing medicine. Ian Bortz had pleaded that it was not he but rather \"speakers\" from another world who had diagnosed the complaints of an investigator posing as a patient. Bortz produced a number of impres\u00ad sive witnesses who testified as to his (or rather his \"speakers' \") expertise not only in medical diagnoses but also in such fields as theology and quantum physics. Mr. Justice Jacques Lessard found that the parapsychological theories ad\u00ad vanced in support of Bortz's claims were not sufficiently well established. The case is under appeal. \u2014Robert S. Carswell Library of Congress Drops 'Occult Sciences' Term SINCE 1910 the Library of Congress has catalogued books on occult topics as \"Occult Sciences.\" Since most such books usually have little to do with real science, this has been a sore point for those who feel the public is already confused enough about these subjects. Now, however, the Library of Con\u00ad gress has decided to change the listing. From now on books on the occult, the supernatural, and psychical research will be catalogued under the more straightfor\u00ad ward term \"Occultism.\" No more mis\u00ad leading reference to science. Sanford Berman, head cataloguer at the Hennepin County Library in Min\u00ad nesota, who campaigned for the change, calls the decision a breakthrough and says his library made the change in 1982. \u2014K.F. 238 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Make plans to join us in Chicago at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare for the 1988 CSICOP Conference Co-sponsored by the Department of Behavioral Sciences of the University of Chicago and the Department of Psychology of the University of Illinois at Chicago Friday to Sunday, November 4 to 6,1988 The New Age: A Scientific Evaluation Friday Sessions The New Age: An Overview Channeling New Age Techniques: Crystal Healing Past-Life Regression UFO Abductions Saturday Sessions Cryptozoolgy Graphology Psychics in die Legal System Responsibility of the Media Sunday Sessions Enhancing the Skeptics' Message Group Workshops PLUS: Lunches, dinners, and banquets with performing artists and the opportunity to meet interesting skeptics from around the world.

MARTIN GARDNER Notes of a Fringe-Watcher The Obligation to Disclose Fraud IT IS customary among editors of scientific journals to let their readers know when a published paper is found to have been based on fraud. It is the only way to prevent the paper from con\u00ad tinuing to mislead later researchers. Such was not the practice of Joseph Banks Rhine. Rhine outlined his policy of secrecy, in a note titled \"The Hypothesis of Deception\" {Journal of Parapsychology, 2, 151-152, 1938), follows: \"Certain of the research in extra-sensory perception,\" he began, \"have recently informed us of rumors . . . that the sub\u00ad jects at Duke University and at other places were practicing deception .. . and that even when caught, these deceptions were deliberately withheld from the pub\u00ad lic. . . .\" Rhine goes on to say that his researchers have become so skillful in safeguarding their experiments against both willful and unwitting deception that \"no magician . . is willing to attempt to work (as a magician) under such condi\u00ad tions.\" Indeed, he continues, so stringent are the controls that \"the mere possibility alone\" of cheating is \"sufficient to bar data from acceptance. ...\" That subjects and experimenters oc\u00ad casionally cheat is to be expected, Rhine says. It is not surprising, therefore, that his laboratory \"[has] encountered a num\u00ad ber of phenomena which on closer in\u00ad vestigation proved to be fraudulently produced.\" Should such evidence be made public? \"We do not feel,\" Rhine answers, \"that any good purpose could be served by the exposure, a la Houdini, of these instances. ... In a word, a research project in ESP does not become of conclusive scientific importance until it reaches the point at which even the greatest will-to-deceive can have no effect under the conditions. This criterion is the very threshold of the research field. It leaves us under no obligation to concern ourselves either with the ethics of the subjects or with the morbid curiosity of a few individuals.\" My morbid curiosity was strongly aroused when I recently read in Louisa Rhine's Something Hidden (1983) a dra\u00ad matic account of her husband's discovery that a paper he had published in his journal was based on deliberate cheating by the author. Mrs. Rhine refers to the dishonest parapsychologist only as \"Jim.\" He had contributed many earlier articles to Rhine's journal, and this new work was \"considered one of the best of those recently reported.\" Banks, as Louisa called her husband, intended to make Jim's paper the \"center\u00ad piece\" of a talk he was scheduled to give at a meeting of parapsychologists in Columbus, Ohio. A few weeks before the symposium, Gardner Murphy asked Rhine for Jim's original records to con\u00ad sider for his own speech on record\u00ad keeping and -checking. Jim brought his records to Rhine a few days before the Columbus meeting. To Rhine's horror, when he and two of his assistants began examining the records, they found un\u00ad mistakable evidence of fraud. \"Jim had 240 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER !\" , Joseph Rhine (right) testing Hubert Pearce, one of his most successful subjects, in 1933. actually consistently falsified his records. . . ,\" Louisa Rhine tells us. \"To produce extra hits Jim had to resort to erasures and transpositions in the records of his call series.\" Rhine journeyed to Columbus in great anguish. He had to scrap the paper he intended to read, and deliver instead, with visible nervousness, an en\u00ad tirely different talk. Jim's college pro\u00ad fessor, after seeing evidence of the cheat\u00ad ing, was profoundly shocked and even blamed himself for not being more vigilant. \"Jim's name,\" Louisa Rhine writes, was never \"again seen in the annals of parapsychology.\" This simply isn't true. Jim (I learned from a disenchanted parapsychologist) was James D. MacFarland, then a young instructor in psychology at Tarkio Col\u00ad lege, in Tarkio, Missouri. His flawed paper, \"Discrimination Between Experimenters by Subjects,\" appeared in Rhine's journal {JP, 2: 160-170, Sept. 1938), the issue following Rhine's piece on deception. No retraction of the paper was ever published. Did references to MacFarland's research vanish from the literature of psi? It did not. J. G. Pratt, in Extrasensory Perception After 60 Years (1940), refers to MacFarland's work. And Pratt was one of Rhine's two assistants who originally discovered MacFarland's fudging! In 1974 Rhine again suffered from unfortunate timing. His paper \"Security Versus Deception in Parapsychology,\" published in his journal (vol. 38, 1974), runs to 23 pages. In it he dismisses decep\u00ad tion by subjects as no longer significant. Self-deception by experimenters is more widespread, but this too is limited, Rhine says, to inexperienced novices who form a \"subspecies of unprepared experimen\u00ad ters\" who \"may soon be approaching extinction.\" Turning to deliberate deception by parapsychologists, Rhine selects twelve sample cases of dishonest experimenters that came to his attention from 1940 to 1950, four of whom were caught \"red- handed.\" Not a single name is mentioned. What papers did they publish, one wonders. Are their papers still being cited as evidence for psi? Rhine is convinced that such fraud diminished markedly after 1960. \"We have at least got past the older phase of having to use detectives and Spring 1988 241 Kaminsky's incredible \"Dear reader\" ad on behalf of Hopkins's book. magicians to discover or prevent trickery by the subjects.\" He applauds the growing use of computers; but although \"machines will not lie,\" he warns against overop- timism about their usefulness in parapsy\u00ad chology. Complex apparatus, he cautions, \"can sometimes also be used as a screen to conceal the trickery it was intended to prevent.\" The warning proved prophetic. A few months after Rhine's paper appeared, the acting director of his laboratory and the young man he had chosen to be his suc\u00ad cessor, Dr. Walter Levy, was caught red- handed tinkering with an electronic re\u00ad cording machine. The tinkering had beefed up the scores of a test he was making on the PK ability of rats. Levy resigned in disgrace, though, again, refer\u00ad ences to his earlier papers (one on the PK powers of live chicken eggs) have not yet entirely vanished from psi litera\u00ad ture. Rhine tried his best to hush up the scandal; but when it was obvious he could not do so, he wrote an apologetic article about it in his journal. As usual he did not mention Levy's name, apparently under the naive delusion that readers would not learn the flimflammer's identity. Four years later, England's most dis\u00ad tinguished parapsychologist, S. G. Soal, was caught having deliberately fudged the data for one of his most famous tests. I see no sign that Soal's other experiments are disappearing from the literature. J. G. Pratt, almost pathologically incapa\u00ad ble of believing anyone would cheat, came to Soal's defense. He argued that Soal may have \"used precognition when inserting digits into the columns of num\u00ad bers he was copying down, unconsciously choosing numbers that would score hits on the calls the subject would make later. For me, this 'experimenter psi' explana\u00ad tion makes more sense, psychologically, than saying that Soal consciously falsified for his own records.\" 242 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER I have been told on reliable authority that the files in Rhine's laboratory con\u00ad tain material suggesting fraud on the part of Hubert Pearce, the most talented of all of Rhine's early psychics. Who knows how much data of this sort is buried in the Rhine archives? Let us hope that someday someone with a balanced sense of history, under no compulsion to regard Rhine as one of psi's saints, will be al\u00ad lowed full access to those archives and give us a biography of Banks that is not a hagiography. Let me change the subject. Early in 1987 Random House published Intruders, by Budd Hopkins. It is one of the funni\u00ad est and shabbiest books ever written about abductions of humans by extrater\u00ad restrials who visit Earth in flying saucers. Hopkins is easy to understand. He is a hack journalist of the occult. Harder to comprehend was a full-page advertise\u00ad ment that appeared in the New York Times Book Review. It is a long \"Dear reader\" letter signed by no less a person\u00ad age than the then-publisher of Random House, Howard Kaminsky. Kaminsky's letter bursts with praise for Hopkins's worthless volume. The book's events are \"objectively set down.\" You might think the author and the pub\u00ad lisher are \"kooks,\" Kaminsky continues, but it is \"Hopkins' calmness, objectivity, and cogency\u2014as well as the mass of medical, physical, and psychiatric evi\u00ad dence he presents\u2014that makes Intruders so unkooky. He is as intelligent and thoughtful as anyone I know, and ques\u00ad tions his own evidence as severely as any skeptic would. . .. There were moments, as I read the manuscript, when I actually got chills down the back of my neck.\" Well, chills slithered down my neck when I read those incredible remarks by the publisher of one of our nation's most distinguished publishing houses. News\u00ad week magazine (October 26, 1987) de\u00ad voted page 62 to the story of how Kaminsky had been suddenly fired from Random House by his superior, Robert Bernstein, chairman of the firm, to be replaced by Joni Evans, from Simon and Schuster. I have no inside information about the personality clashes behind what Newsweek called the \"rumble at Random House,\" but I suspect and hope that Kaminsky's idiotic letter played a role in the rumble. Thoughts Are Cheap Fifteen years of monthly columns have brought me an enormous correspondence from nonprofessionals about all aspects of science. From sheer volume, I obtain a pretty good sense of strengths and weaknesses in public perceptions. I have found that one common misconception surpasses all others. People will write, telling me that they have developed a revolutionary theory, one that will expand the boundaries of science. These theories, usually described in several pages of single-spaced type\u00ad script, are speculations about the deepest ultimate questions we can ask\u2014what is the nature of life? the origin of the universe? the beginning of time? But thoughts are cheap. Any person of intelligence can devise his half dozen before breakfast. Scientists can also spin out ideas about ultimates. We don't (or, rather, we confine them to our private thoughts) because we cannot devise ways to test them, to decide whether they are right or wrong. What good to science is a lovely idea that cannot, as a matter of principle, ever be affirmed or denied? -Stephen Jay Gould, in \"Justice Scalia's Misunderstanding,\" Natural History, October 1987 Spring 1988 243 ROBERT SHEAFFER Psychic Vibrations WHILE THE GREAT outburst of UFOria of 1987 has been slowly deflating like a leaking balloon, a few noteworthy UFO-related events have not had the attention they deserve. By this time it seems that practically everyone, believer and skeptic alike, considers the \"MJ-12\" crashed-saucer documents (see SI, Winter 1987-88, and pp. 279-289 of this issue) to be a hoax\u2014except for the small circle of UFOlogists who found and released them. However, UFO-contactee Jennings Fredrick avows their authentic\u00ad ity. In a letter published in James Mose- ley's semi-legendary Saucer Smear, Fredrick claims to have stumbled across a copy of the original document years ago, when he allegedly held a \"top secret\" security clearance and worked inside\" a: three-foot-thick steel and concrete vault. Not only was the supersecret facility pro\u00ad tected by armed guards and vicious guard dogs, but it even had closed-circuit tele\u00ad vision with \"armed scanning lasers, set to kill\"! Skeptics, however, remain un\u00ad convinced by Fredrick's corroborative testimony, recalling his earlier claimed encounter with \"Vegetable Man,\" a strange alien creature that, when first sighted, was mistaken for a bush. Fredrick reported that the plantlike alien telepathically communicated to him its need for medical assistance, whereupon it used one of its sharp fingers to punc\u00ad ture Fredrick's arm and withdraw a small amount of blood. Other developments on the UFO front involve the husband-and-wife lecture -te\u00b0ni of Michael and Aurora El-Legion, who claim to be in telepathic contact with the \"Intergalactic Federation.\" For a number of years they have been making lecture tours around the country, selling books, tapes, and New Age cosmic jewel\u00ad ry, while peddling yarns about their inter\u00ad stellar contacts. Last summer, the pair gave a series of lectures to large audiences at the University of Hawaii, where they showed films of alleged \"UFOs from the Pleiades\" taken by Billy Meier of Switzerland. Soon thereafter, they were indicted on charges of conspiracy and credit-card fraud. The Honolulu Star Bulletin reports that the El-Legions were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of selling unauthorized telephone credit-card numbers, resulting in a loss of about $500,000 for U.S. Sprint. In a similar development, the Mutual UFO Network relates that, pursuant to their complaint to the postal authorities, 244 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER the International Space Science Founda\u00ad tion has signed a consent decree, agreeing to stop offering for sale through the mails a tape that purports to be of a meeting between space aliens and government officials in a small Texas town. The exis\u00ad tence of such a tape (which no one seems to have actually received) no doubt sounded suspicious to MUFON since most of its members believe that the space aliens whose UFO crashed in the desert were already dead by the time they fell into government hands. UFOs are not the only bizarre things being reported of late. The Oakland (Calif.) Tribune reports that people are calling the Fox Broadcasting Company's \"Werewolf Hotline\" not only to find out about werewolf legends but to report actual sightings of such beasts! After Fox premiered its \"Werewolf show last July, it began receiving so many inquiries from viewers that it instituted the toll-free \"hotline\" in September. There were 346,000 calls in just the first six weeks. Many of the callers claimed to have actu\u00ad ally seen werewolves in various parts of the country, some even blaming unsolved murders on them. What is an open-minded researcher to make of all this? Surely all of these people cannot be hallucinating or making up stories. (Credible persons reporting incredible things: Such were UFOlogy's humble beginnings.) Dragged along re\u00ad luctantly by the inexorable logic of the situation, I felt forced to conclude that the werewolf must be every bit as real as Bigfoot, or the monster in Loch Ness. vincing. This past July the veteran Amer\u00ad ican monster-chaser Jon Erik Beckjord was in Edinburgh to show his Nessie films taken four years earlier to a meeting of scientists. While there, he met Alexander Crosbie, a retired window cleaner from Inverness, who claims to have had Nessie sightings going all the way back to the 1940s. Crosbie persuaded Beckjord to accompany him back to the Loch for another look, citing his own success at knowing when and where to see Nessie. On the afternoon they arrived, Beckjord left Crosbie with his photographic equip\u00ad ment and went off to rent a car. You can imagine Beckjord's surprise, not to men\u00ad tion personal disappointment, when upon his return Crosbie claimed to have filmed an outstandingly fine apparition of Nes\u00ad sie! \"He seems to have a talent for finding the monster,\" Beckjord remarked envi\u00ad ously. A greatly enlarged print of the monster's head was published in James Moseley's Saucer Smear, in which Beck\u00ad jord claims to see not only the creature's skull-like head, but the faces of several other materialized entities. (We recall that, according to Beckjord, crypto- creatures are actually paranormal mani\u00ad festations.) However, neither Moseley nor Speaking of Loch Ness, it seems that Nessie has been surfacing once again, although being careful, as always, to choose a place or time so as not to leave behind any evidence that is too con-\u00abSJ! Spring 1988 245 I, nor apparently anyone else, could dis\u00ad cern any pattern or images whatsoever lurking in the highly magnified grains of the photographic emulsion. For the fol\u00ad lowing issue of Saucer Smear, Beckjord helpfully supplied a copy of the same print, with the alleged skull-like face sketched in between the grains. However, it still failed to impress anyone. Shifting gears somewhat, Beckjord told the Associated Press that the creature has a catlike face and a body that \"looks like a cross between Halley's Comet and the Concorde jet.\" If you are confused as to whether the face of Nessiteras rhombop- teryx resembles a skull or a cat, remem\u00ad ber that paranormal entities can materi\u00ad alize or dematerialize at will; hence there is no reason to expect them to have the same appearance during each manifesta\u00adtion. In October, \"Operation Deepscan,\" a small fleet of sonar-equipped boats, probed the depths of the Loch. The ex\u00ad pedition, organized by Adrian Shine, a salesman from London, was not solely interested in Nessie, but was also studying the Loch's fish species and underwater currents. They systematically covered the entire Loch with sonar capable of resolv\u00ad ing objects as small as four inches. While some underwater objects were detected, which were believed to be floating debris, no monster was found. However, a film was obtained of a rotting tree stump under 22 feet of water. Its shape was virtually identical to the figure in a photo taken in 1975 by the Academy of Applied Sciences, purported to be the gorgoyle- shaped head of the mythical creature.

(716) 834-3222 Neuropathology and the Legacy Of Spiritual Possession Three brain syndromes\u2014epilepsy, Tourette's Syndrome, and migraine\u2014 probably fomented ancient notions of possession and transcendence. Barry L. Beyerstein IN AN EARLIER companion article (Beyerstein 1987) I discussed the psychoneural identity hypothesis\u2014that consciousness is strictly tied to the function of individual brains. The strong empirical support for this hypothesis undermines occult beliefs in disembodied minds, \"cosmic\" con\u00ad sciousness, telepathy, and the like. Research indicates that many mystical or \"transcendent\" experiences are produced by certain brain states. Some are pathological, others are induced by specific manipulations, and some are occasional spontaneous discharges in otherwise normal brains. \"Transcendence\"\u2014consciousness apparently infused with outside spirits or freed to \"merge with the universe\"\u2014seems profoundly real and insightful, yet ineffable (Fenwick 1983; James 1929; Mandell 1980; Neher 1980). Three brain syndromes whose mental consequences probably fomented ancient notions of possession and transcendence are epilepsy, Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome, and migraine. The Sacred Disease And one of the multitude . . . said, \"Master, I have brought unto Thee my son, which hath a dumb spirit; and wheresoever he taketh him, he teareth him: and he foameth, and gnasheth with pineth away . . . and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us and help us.\" (Mark 9:17-22) This anguished father sought exorcism of a demon. Today, we recognize the symptoms of epilepsy. About 400 years before this scriptural account, Barry L. Beyerstein is in the Brain Behavior Laboratory, Simon Fraser University, Bumaby, B.C. V5A 1S6, Canada. 248 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Hippocrates argued in On the Sacred Disease that the bizarre sensations, emotions, and behaviors considered to be demonic possession were actually due to a brain disease.' Unfortunately, this humane insight has continued to be swamped by superstition. Astonishingly, even today, many share the ancient Romans' fear that epilepsy can be absorbed by touch or by sharing a cup. In Rome, epileptics were banished from their families and spat upon in the streets to ward off demonic contagion. The Roman view of disease as divine retribution made all invalids somewhat blameworthy,2 but epilepsy was especially shameful and repulsive because demonic presence was assumed. With its mix of physical and psychological symptoms, epilepsy, more than any other disease, has pitted naturalistic against magical schools of thought: As soon as a rational [system of] pathology was established claiming to explain all diseases as merely physical processes, explanation of epilepsy became a test for the validity ... of the whole system. Accordingly, the history of epilepsy becomes ... an example of the history of magical beliefs and their refutation by .. . scientific physicians. (Tempkin 1971, p. 4) Twenty-four hundred years after the Hippocratics denounced supernatural conceptions of epilepsy, sufferers still face discrimination from would-be spouses, employers, and landlords and from insurance, licensing, and im\u00ad migration agencies (Schneider and Conrad 1983, p. 45). It has only been since 1959 that epileptics have been permitted to join the U.S. Civil Service and since the mid-1970s that Canada would accept them as immigrants. In a recent poll, 53 percent of respondents said they would discourage their children from marrying an epileptic and 5 percent wouldn't even permit one to live in their neighborhood (Ries 1977). Strangest of all, in an age when most mental and behavioral symptoms of epilepsy are treatable (Adams 1977a; Barnes 1986; Penry 1975), so-called \"fits\" continue to nurture archaic possession myths. In 1978, two West German priests and the parents of an epileptic were convicted of causing her death in a brutal 11-month exorcism. (They received suspended sentences.) The local bishop, citing Jesus' admonition that demons can only be expelled by fasting and prayer (Mark 9:29), authorized starving 23-year-old Anneliese Michel, who weighed only 68 pounds at the time of her death (Vancouver [B.C.] Sun, March 28, 1978). Her epilepsy could have been treated and her life saved as late as a week before her demise. Characteristics of Epilepsy Many different genetic, medical, biochemical, and environmental factors can cause \"seizures\" of diverse kinds and severity (Adams 1977a; Barnes 1986; Goldensohn 1975; Pincus and Tucker 1978). They may be a once-in-a-lifetime reaction to high fever or drug overdose or recur every few minutes due to a tumor or scarring in the brain. Spring 1988 249 a. Normal EEG V b.

Electroencephalograms (EEGs) of a normal adult and during grand mal and petit mal seizures. What all seizures have in common is a disorderly, paroxysmal neural discharge that produces distinctive \"spiking\" on the EEG (Figure 1). This may be restricted to a small region or may engulf the entire brain. When, for whatever reason, neurons in an \"epileptic focus\" begin to pulsate in unison they recruit adjacent cells in an ever-widening net until a full-blown seizure ensues. Activated thusly, these neurons exert their customary mental or behavioral effects, however inappropriate this may be. Grand Mal and Petit Mal Seizures. The best-known form of epilepsy, the grand mal convulsion, begins with a cry, collapse, and unconsciousness. As the electrical firestorm sweeps through the motor cortex (Figure 2), rigidity and thrashing ensue as muscles are activated indiscriminately throughout the body. Oral spasms cause protrusion of the tongue and foaming at the mouth; respiratory paralysis produces a bluish pallor. Incontinence is also common. 250 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER temporal lobe 1.

Mid-section of the brain, showing interior structures. FIGURE 2. Exterior and interior views of the human brain. After a minute or so, the convulsion subsides into a coma lasting up to half an hour. It is easy to see why victims and onlookers alike would invoke supernatural causes for such an awesome ordeal. But epilepsy need not be this dramatic. Petit mal seizures result from epileptic discharges in the reticular system (Figure 2b), which controls the arousal and attentional status of the brain. The result may be little more than rhythmic eyeblinks and a temporary loss of consciousness. This \"absence\" can be so brief as to go unnoticed, even by the victim. Psychomotor Seizures. If the paroxysmal discharge is centered in sub\u00ad cortical regions, particularly the limbic system (MacLean 1970; Vilenksy, Van Hoesen, and Damasio 1982) of the temporal lobes (Figure 3), the effects appear to be coordinated, intentional actions. Nonetheless, during a \"psycho\u00ad motor seizure\" (lasting from a few seconds up to several hours), behavior is automatic and beyond environmental control. Stored behavioral programs are being \"read out\" from motivational and emotional units of the brain. This \"readout\" can be violent or sexual, though usually it is not. The uninten\u00ad tional and irresistible character of psychomotor seizures favors the victim's Spring 1988 251 fornix olfactory bulbs FIGURE 3. The limbic system. assumption that an invisible entity has suddenly arrogated his will. The word epilepsy is derived from the Greek verb meaning \"to lay hold of.\" The Epileptic Aura. With respect to occultism, the \"aura\" preceding seizures is of particular interest.3 Contact with the environment is not yet lost, but it seems distant and unreal. Visual, auditory, somatic, and olfactory hallucinations interweave with veridical percepts. New surroundings may seem peculiarly familiar (deja vu) or frequented places may seem novel (jamais vu). Auras are often fearsome and foreboding, but they can also be ecstatic. Divine, diabolical, or natural interpretations variously appeal to different personalities and social/educational backgrounds. Some people experience auras that never progress to overt seizures. \"Hear\u00ad ing voices\" or \"seeing visions\" with strong emotional overtones could well seem supernatural, even to those who would attribute overt epilepsy to natural causes. The brain registers the apparent origin of such self-generated sensa\u00ad tions as external (Mandell 1980). Feeling the \"presence\" of God, angels, Satan, the Virgin Mary, departed loved ones, and so on, is a recurrent theme in both the occult and epileptic literatures. Because of the limbic system's role in evaluating the novelty and emotional significance of experiences (Vilensky, Van Hoesen, and Damasio 1982), short- circuits therein can affect perceived familiarity and imbue minutiae with cosmic importance. Electrical stimulation of the temporal lobes during neuro\u00ad surgery produces dreamy, auralike effects: deja vu, awe, and portentiousness; estrangement from the body; compulsive repetition of thoughts and behaviors 252 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER (Adams 1977a; Chatrian and Chapman 1960), as well as extremely lifelike hallucinations (Penfield 1958). According and general anxiety .. . , more subtle stimulation evokes intense meaningfulness and peak experiences; the latter are often in conjunction with altered body percep\u00ad tions, such as out-of-body experiences ... or convictions of cosmic conscious\u00ad ness. Our sense of \"self is a complex inference based on continually updated body sensations, external percepts, and time cues. When brain mechanisms integrating these cues with memories are disrupted by disease, sensory over\u00ad load, psychotropic drugs, and so on, the self seems to lose its physical boundaries. Psychologists call this \"depersonalization\" or \"ego dissolution\"; to mystics it is \"oneness with the universe.\" Interestingly, auras often include olfactory hallucinations, ranging from the reek of putrefying flesh to an ineffably fragrant breeze. Tales of the stench of \"hellfire and brimstone\" and the perfumed atmosphere of paradise probably owe something to the fact that the limbic system evolved out of primitive olfactory tissue. Much folklore on satanic visitations may have derived from the propensity of limbic seizures to produce visceral sensations of revulsion, including vomiting (Mitchell, Greenwood, and Messenheimer 1983), along with terror and foreboding. Persons allegedly abducted by extraterrestrials also typically describe olfactory, emotional, and visceral experiences that are quite consistent with temporal-lobe abnormalities. For more fortunate epileptics, whose pathology is probably in a slightly different part of the limbic circuit, symptoms may include spontaneous episodes of transcendent joy. Dostoyevsky (himself an epileptic) described this dissolution of conflict and feeling of total unity in The Possessed: . . . When you suddenly feel the presence of external . . . harmony it is clear, indisputable, absolute feeling.... You suddenly perceive the entirety of creation. ... It is a joy so great that, even if it were to last more than five seconds, the soul would not endure it and it would fade away . . . and for that I would give my whole life and not think I was paying too dearly. Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and Personality. It is apparent that seizures produce sensations and automatisms like those ascribed to \"possessions\" and their high-tech variants, extraterrestrial \"abductions,\" but do they also have consequences between attacks? David Bear (1979), noting the effects of limbic damage in animals, suggested that prolonged epileptic stimulation might alter limbic connections, producing characteristic emotional, motivational, and cognitive traits between seizures. The \"religiosity\" of temporal-lobe epileptics (TLEs) has been recognized by neurologists since the 1800s (Dewhurst and Beard 1970). Comparing TLEs with control patients, Bear (1979) found TLEs easily distinguishable by their humorlessness, excessive moral zeal, and tendency to Spring 1988 253 find profound meaning in mundane events. They were obsessed with details and often kept voluminous diaries, intending to work them into great meta\u00ad physical tomes. Their preoccupation with idiosyncratic religious, mystical, and cosmological speculation was invested with a strong sense of divine guidance and personal destiny. Repeated conversions were common, as was suspicion of those who failed to grasp the truth of their revelations. The particular symptoms varied with left- or right-hemisphere location of the epileptic focus. Other common TLE symptoms are a drastically reduced interest in sex (Blumer and Walker 1967) and a tendency to withdraw from human contact in general (MacLean 1970). Though Fenwick (1983) reports difficulty finding some of these traits in his patients, Bear's observations concur with my own. A serviceman I met on a recent transcontinental flight was a classic case: Hardly waiting to buckle his seatbelt, he announced he'd had an abrupt religious conversion (during a seizure prior to removal of a temporal-lobe tumor). He said God had personally afflicted him, then cured him, diverting him from wickedness to saving souls. Totally bereft of humor, he informed me he had divorced his wife because \"she suddenly became obsessed with sex.\" As a personnel officer, he claimed to have memorized the serial numbers, social insurance numbers, and boot sizes of every member of his regiment and that he was transferring soldiers around Canada to fill gaps in chapel choirs. Asked if he had recorded this epic, he produced three rucksacks crammed with notebooks, all filled with rhyming couplets! While the foregoing does not imply that all religious and mystical fervor is of pathological origin (Deikman 1977), Bear's typology is reminiscent of the cadre of solitary visionaries, prophets, and harmless cranks that have always populated the margins of society. It also matches the behavior of many historical figures whose conviction and grandiosity have attracted large followings, not always with salutary outcomes. A few of the charismatic figures thought to have had epilepsy include the emperors Julius Caesar, Caligula, and Claudius, several pharaohs, Alexander the Great, Napoleon, Buddha, Muhammad, St. Paul, St. Teresa of Avila, and Emanuel Swedenborg. Historically, the few epileptics of high birth or conspicuous talent, or whose messianic vision infected others, were revered as divinely chosen. Most, however, met persecution, often death. The probable contribution of epilepsy to religious dogma is not confined to antiquity, as seen in the recent controversy surrounding the Seventh Day Adventist prophet, Ellen White (1827-1915). Her \"visions,\" accepted by the faithful as divinely inspired, revealed that wigs cause insanity, masturbation is fatal, and certain races derived from intercourse with lower animals. Com\u00ad pounding earlier accusations of rampant plagiarism (Ostling 1982), Delbert Hodder, a physician and practicing Adventist, uncovered indications that White's \"spells\" were of epileptic rather than heavenly origin (Clapp 1982). Her deep religiosity and other TLE signs followed a serious head injury at age nine. Seizurelike aspects of her \"visions\" included vivid percepts and emotions, with eyes open and rolled upward, and monotonously repeated 254 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER phrases and gestures interspersed with exhortative cries. Her sense of divine guidance, apocalyptic fervor, and the sheer volume of her writings (more than 50 books) reinforce the diagnosis. Predictably, Adventist officials have charged revisionists and doubters with satanic influence (Christianity Today, November 20, 1981). Temporal-Lobe Instability in Nonepileptics. Persinger (1983) suggests that \"microseizures\" (occasional electrical aberrancies in the temporal lobes) could produce milder versions of the profound meaningfulness, divine peace, and so on, felt by TLEs. The complex feedback circuitry of the limbic system makes it prone to oscillatory (i.e., epileptiform) activity. In susceptible persons, this reverberation could be triggered by \"the chemical consequences of per\u00ad sonal crisis, anxiety, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and fatigue\" (Persinger 1983). Between attacks, these people would be more normal than TLEs but might still share some of their characteristics. Among unselected college students (Persinger 1984), those reporting dramatic mystical, religious, or paranormal experiences (e.g., divine presence) scored significantly higher, though still within the normal range, on tests of temporal-lobe dysfunction. They were also more likely to keep diaries. While it cannot be proved retrospectively that any experience of posses\u00ad sion, conversion, revelation, or divine ecstasy was merely an epileptic dis\u00ad charge, we must ask how one differentiates \"real transcendence\" from neuro\u00ad pathies that produce the same extreme realness, profundity, ineffability, and sense of cosmic unity. When accounts of sudden religious conversions in TLEs are laid alongside the epiphanous revelations of the religious tradition, the parallels are striking (Dewhurst and Beard 1970). The same is true of the recent spate of alleged UFO abductees. Parsimony alone argues against invok\u00ad ing spirits, demons, or extraterrestrials when natural causes will suffice. Brain States, Intense Emotion, and Conversion If neuropathology can trigger mystical/transcendent feelings, are there other ways to produce them in normal people? Social, psychological, physical, and dietary manipulations can affect limbic function. Many political and religious rituals manipulate sensory input, emotional arousal, attention, movement, and fatigue to alter consciousness. Rhythmic visual, auditory, and motor ac\u00ad tivity can entrain neural firing to induce seizurelike effects (Neher 1980). Resulting dissociative states probably underlie a variety of possession, exor\u00ad cism, and conversion and Jones 1982). Sargant (1957, 1973) found that numerous practices used since ancient times to promote religious and political conversions employ techniques that affect brain chemistry: (a) induction of stress, fear, and arousal interspersed with sudden relief; (b) rhythmic sensory bombardment, e.g., music, chanting, and dancing; (c) hyperventilation; (d) food, water, and sleep deprivation; and (e) physical exhaustion. Observing rallies, revival meetings, tribal dancing, Spring 1988 255 voodoo rites, and so on, around the world, Sargant (1973) admitted that his academic understanding and attempted detachment offered limited protection against their alluring effects: I was now beginning to understand better how Hitler, for instance, had been so successful in using mass rallies, marching and martial music, chanting of slogans, and highly emotional oratory and ceremony, to bring even highly intelligent Germans into a condition of intellectual and emotional subjection, (p. 143) The cathartic climax of all such rituals lends apparent supernatural valida\u00ad tion to the indoctrination. \"Kindling\" and Conversion. The durability of personality changes after \"conversions\" is undoubtedly due in part to revised self-perception, but there is also possibly a neural contribution. Repetitive neural excitement can leave nerve tracts permanently easier to activate in the future\u2014thus seizure-related conscious alterations can become self-perpetuating. Kindling (Gaito 1976) was first demonstrated in animal brains stimulated with electrical pulses that were too weak initially to elicit seizures. Over successive days, this previously innocuous stimulation became capable of triggering seizures. Limbic circuits are particularly prone to kindling (perhaps a by-product of their involvement in encoding memory traces). We have seen that ritualized breathing, chanting, dancing, and so on, can produce epilepti\u00ad form activity. Pulsatile neural firing, whether from rhythmic activities, drugs, or untreated epileptic foci, may set the stage for the lasting personality Similarities in effects of psychotropic drugs, temporal-lobe seizures, con\u00ad version rituals, and certain hypnotic, meditative, and psychotic states have been apparent to many observers 1977; James 1973). Mandell (1980) has reviewed research suggesting there is a common brain mechanism affected by all transcendence-inducing conditions. He implicates the biogenic amine neuro\u00ad transmitters and serotonin) that control ability of limbic structures. Brain levels of biogenic amines are affected by genetics, drugs, and a host of stressors and other environmental conditions. Various routes to transcendence share the ability to reduce serotonin activity in limbic pathways, \"disinhibiting the temporal lobes discharges in temporal-lobe limbic structures\" (Mandell 1980, p. 392). Isolated hippocampal (Figure 3) discharges produce only conscious aberrations. If the adjacent amygdala is also involved, psycho\u00ad motor seizures are generated. Tourette's Syndrome A condition that probably contributed much to our cultural stereotype of demonic possession is the rare neurological disorder Gilles de la Tourette's 256 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Syndrome (Friedhoff and Chase 1982; Shapiro and Shapiro 1983). Named after the French physician who described it in 1885, it parallels the behavior of the \"possessed\" girl in the movie The Exorcist. Often misdiagnosed as schizophrenia, Tourette's Syndrome (TS) symptoms also match many depic\u00ad Malleus Maleficarum (Witches' Hammer), the fifteenth-century inquisitors' manual for detecting witches (Kramer and Sprenger 1971). The mean age of onset for TS is approximately seven years; males out\u00ad number females three to one (Devinsky 1983). Initial symptoms are involun\u00ad tary facial \"tics,\" grimaces, and upward eye-rolling (\"transmogrification\" in lore), progressing to spontaneous vocalizations, such as throat-clearing, grunts, growls, shrieks, and barks. The prominence of animals in demonology is probably no accident (cf. Kramer and Sprenger 1971, pp. 122-124). About 60 percent of TS cases exhibit verbal outbursts of a sexual, scato\u00ad logical, or blasphemous nature. \"Forbidden\" sexual, aggressive, or sacrilegious thoughts intrude, along with the feeling that verbal expression will dissipate the pressure to act them out. The sensation of some perverse entity \"pulling the strings\" adds dread to bewilderment. The possession hypothesis gains from the fact that TS sufferers, between attacks, show normal intelligence, emotions, and sense of reality. Some have been able to maintain high stations despite occasional obscene or animalistic outbursts. A prince of the court of Louis XIV used to suppress involuntary barking by stuffing things in his mouth (Shapiro and Shapiro 1983). A fascinating case of suspected TS was that of Dr. Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) (Murray 1982). Though twice denied teaching positions because of his bizarre contortions and vocalizations, his wit and eloquence dazzled London's in\u00ad tellectual and social elite. \"Eccentricities\" of the powerful are often perversities in their underlings. There are suggestions that supersensitivity of the brain's dopamine recep\u00ad tors might cause TS (Devinsky 1983) and that this might be genetic (Jenkins and Ashby 1983). The dopamine blocker haloperidol offers symptomatic relief, but there is as yet no cure. The Shapiros (1983) report, not surprisingly, that none of their TS patients who turned to exorcism found relief. Given the emotional and motivational character of TS symptoms, atten\u00ad tion has centered on limbic mechanisms in the search for pathology. Because of its involvement in social and emotional vocalizations in primates, the periaqueductal gray region (Figure 2b) is a prime candidate. Another limbic component, the cingulate cortex (Figure 3) has been implicated in the in\u00ad voluntary movements of TS (Bonnet 1982). Pitman (1983) suggests that an inherited chemical imbalance in these evolutionarily old areas of the brain may allow expression of primitive instinctual urges normally restrained by higher centers. Migraine and Supernatural Beliefs Many readers, unfortunately, will be personally familiar with the following description by Aretaeus, a Greek physician of the second century A.D Spring 1988 257 An illness by no means mild . .. [it] occasions unseemly and dreadful symptoms . . . nausea and vomiting of bilious matters; collapse the patient. . . . There is much torpor, heaviness of the head, anxiety; and life becomes a burden. For they flee the light; the darkness soothes their disease; nor can they bear readily to look upon or hear anything pleasant. . . . The patients are weary of life and wish to die. (Quoted in Sacks 1970, p. 23.) Migraine is the most prevalent of all neurological disorders, affecting 5 to 10 percent of the population. Its onset, an aura that can resemble that of epilepsy, was also described by Aretaeus, whose contemporary, Pelops, first applied the term aura to seizures. Migraine auras begin with vague premoni\u00ad tions of unease, followed by a kaleidoscope of visual and other sensory disturbances lasting half an hour or more (Adams 1977b; Richards 1972; Sacks 1970). Numbness and tingling of lips, face, and extremities coexist with mental confusion, arrested speech, weakness, drowsiness, and dizziness. Ter\u00ad rifying or rapturous trancelike states hallucinations, deja vu, ineffability, portentiousness, depersonalization, etc.) are also reported (Sacks 1970, p. 98). As the aura recedes, an excruciating headache follows, throbbing with each heartbeat. At its peak, there may be nausea and vomiting. Typically the pain and disorientation last several hours, but durations of several days are not uncommon. Migraine auras are caused by spasms in cerebral arteries, leading to neuro\u00ad chemical changes in blood-starved cortical regions. As this vasoconstriction reverses, rebounding bloodflow stretches artery walls, initiating the terrible pain. It is generally agreed that susceptibility to migraine is inherited, but psychological, hormonal, dietary, and allergic factors have been suggested as possible \"triggers\" in those at risk. Visual Phenomena of Migraine. The first inkling of an attack is usually a small \"fuzzy\" crescent in the visual field. This blind region typically enlarges, bounded by scintillating \"zig-zag\" lines (Figure 4). These are called \"fortifica\u00ad tion illusions,\" as they resemble old battlements (Richards 1972). Objects in the visual field can suddenly change color, grow, shrink, or disappear completely. Through the ages, skilled observers have recorded their experiences of migraine (Richards 1972; Sacks 1970). Whether they seemed natural or transcendent varied with the individual and the era. Exquisite depictions of \"visions\" we now recognize as migraine effects were left by Hildegard of Bingen, a twelfth-century mystic nun. She considered her visions a divine calling. In the dazzling showers of flashing light, brilliant halos around objects, and fortification patterns, she saw angelic hosts and glimpses of the city of God (Figure 5). As Sacks (1970, Chap. 3) reflects: [Hildegard's visions] provide a unique example of the manner in which a physio\u00ad logical event, banal, hateful, or meaningless to the vast majority of people, can become, in a privileged consciousness, the substrate of a supreme ecstatic vision. 258 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER \"Fortification patterns\" surrounding a crescent- shaped scotoma, or blind area. The \"O\" repre\u00ad sents the point of fixation of the person's gaze. The zig-zag patterns flicker and are interspersed with colored areas as the affected area of the visual field expands. Between 10 and 20 minutes are required for the pattern to expand from the fixation point to the edges of the visual field as shown below. Enlargement of the migraine sco\u00ad toma over time, as drawn by the physician Hubert Airy about 1870. \"O\" is the fixation point of the person's gaze. FIGURE 4. In more recent times, migraines have provided a different sort of inspira\u00ad tion for the scientifically curious. By the 1870s, the British Astronomer Royal, G. B. Airy, could depict perceptions similar to Hildegard's but speculate intelligently on possible brain mechanisms that could generate them. Study of migrainous visual anomalies has suggested valuable clues about the organiza\u00ad tion of the visual cortex (Richards 1972). As with epilepsy, some migraine sufferers experience the aura without succumbing to the devastating attacks. Contributions of these spontaneous warps in the fabric of consciousness to the mystical world-view are probably considerable. Spring 1988 259 FIGURE 5. Portraits of her migrainous visions from a manuscript by the mystic Hildegard of Bingen (1089-1180). Showers of shimmering stars, fortification pat\u00ad terns, etc., are depicted as radiating from a central spot. The Limbic System and Transcendence Different cultures and personalities embellish the basic experience of the same neural phenomena in various ways. The means of achieving temporal- lobe hyperactivity and its subjective effects are quite diverse. The experiences modern neuroscience attributes to common origins have been variously described: \"the mystical experience\" (William James), \"the of truth\" (Harvard undergraduate on LSD), \"the dawning of new world\" (Gordon Wasson on \"magic\" mushrooms), \"divine intuition\" (William Blake). Asked after experiencing LSD if these were all the same, religious philosopher Alan Watts replied, \"Embarrassingly so\" (Mandell 1980, p. 439). Notes 1. In fact, this oldest extant text on epilepsy was probably authored by several of the master's anonymous students. It details many magical beliefs of ancient Greece and asserts that both normal and abnormal psychological functions reside in the brain. 2. Epilepsy was considered by the Romans to be punishment by the moon goddess. Superstitions persist that it can be \"caught\" by standing in the light of a full moon and that seizures are more prevalent during the full moon. 3. \"Aura\" is derived from the Greek word for \"wind\" as a sufferer described it to the ancient physician Pelops. This is not to be confused with the highly suspect \"aura\" of colored light psychics claim surrounds people and changes with mood, health, etc. (cf. Neher 1980, pp. 186-191). References Adams, R.

Bill Ellis SCHOLARS WHO study the folklore of past and present cultures may have some useful perspectives to offer about the many recent reports of abduction by aliens. At the conclusion of his review of Whitley Strieber's Communion, Ernest H. Taves (1987) suggests that either Strieber is mentally ill or he is consciously perpetrating a hoax, \"playing a joke on his readers.\" Taves then invokes Occam's Razor to opt for the latter and tacitly pare away any other alternative. (Taves may be correct, but he is not logical. Occam's Razor is a method for analyzing alternatives and choosing the simplest explanation that will explain the evidence. It cannot be used to eliminate alternatives without analysis.) Robert A. Baker (1987-88) suggests a far simpler explanation: that Strieber is a fantasy-prone personality sincerely describing what he believes he remembers. From the perspective of psy\u00ad chology, Baker suggests several recognized and well-understood mechanisms for such \"memories,\" including hypnogogic hallucination, confabulation, and inadvertent cueing by the hypnotist (the \"Clever Hans\" phenomenon in yet another form). Folklorists familiar with accounts of supranormal experiences can, how\u00ad ever, suggest two additional mechanisms at work: one may explain Strieber's experience; the other certainly accounts for his actions since his \"abduction.\" 1. On October 4 and December 26, 1985, Strieber may have actually experienced an event, common to many other cultures and individuals, in which he felt paralyzed and then believed he was levitated and subjected to indignities by nonhuman agents. 2. Whether Strieber experienced this event or not, he did undergo, during the period from January to March 1986, an experience identical to that of religious conversion. Bill Ellis is assistant professor of English and American studies at the Hazleton Campus of The Pennsylvania State University. Among other studies of supernatural folklore, Dr. Ellis has written the entry on \"Abduction\"for the forthcoming Encyclo\u00ad pedia of American Popular Beliefs and Superstitions. Spring 1988 263 Collections of legends and folktales, both European and otherwise, contain a variety of \"real life\" accounts that contain close parallels to elements of modern abduction stories. Most of these are anonymous, migratory tales that have no weight as evidence. Some, however, contain alleged firsthand experi\u00ad ences. Strieber himself notes these parallels and cites them as support for the \"reality\" of his abduction. The more carefully recorded cases, however, make it clear that these earlier abductions, like Strieber's, were subjective in nature. Anne Jeffries (ca. 1626-1698), an illiterate country girl from Cornwall, was one such celebrated abductee. In 1645 she apparently suffered a convul\u00ad sion and was found, semi-conscious, lying on the floor. As she recovered, she began to recall in detail how she was accosted by a group of six little men. Paralyzed, she felt them swarm over her, kissing her, until she felt a sharp pricking sensation. Blinded, she found herself flying through the air to a palace filled with people. There, one of the men (now her size) seduced her, and suddenly an angry crowd burst in on them and she was again blinded and levitated. She then found herself lying on the floor surrounded by her friends. Significantly, the accounts note that the experience left her ill for some time, and only after she regained her health did she \"recall\" this experience. Still, like Strieber, Jeffries claimed that this encounter was followed by further contacts with the \"fairies,\" and she was taken seriously enough by the local authorities in 1646 to be arrested for witchcraft and imprisoned (Briggs 1971, pp. 176-177; Briggs 1976, pp. 239-242). A more recent incident, with some connections to Strieber's alleged experi\u00ad ence, was reported by theologian Henry James, Sr. One afternoon in May 1844, relaxing in his chair, James suddenly felt the presence of some invisible, ineffably evil being squatting in the room with him. Rationally, he recognized that his emotion \"was a perfect insane and abject terror, without ostensible cause\"; still he found himself completely paralyzed while (as in Strieber's October 4 experience) his mind was flooded with images of \"doubt, anxiety, and despair\" (Edel 1953, p. 30). The senior James eventually found release in the fringe religion of Swedenborgianism, while his sons dealt with the impact of this experience in their own ways. William James provided one of the first rational anatomies of paranormal encounters in The Varieties of Religious Experience; Henry James, Jr., dealt with the lingering threat of such events in his fiction, ranging from The Turn of the Screw to \"The Jolly Corner,\" both of which contain suggestive parallels to Communion. Some light has been thrown on such experiences by folklorist David Hufford. In Newfoundland, he found, the term \"Old Hag\" referred to a fairly common phenomenon in which a person who is (as Strieber was on October 4 and December 26) relaxed but apparently awake suddenly finds himself paralyzed and in the presence of some nonhuman entity. Often the sensation is accompanied by terrifying hallucinations\u2014of shuffling sounds, of humanoid figures with prominent eyes, even.(rarely) of strange, musty smells. Often the figure even sits on the victim's chest, causing a choking sensation. Like Baker, Hufford at first assumed that the consistencies present in 264 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER victims' accounts of the Old Hag could be explained by previous exposure to oral traditions\u2014the \"cultural source hypothesis.\" It is interesting, though, that when he moved his base of research to the United States, Hufford (1982, p. 245) found the experience just as common here as in Newfoundland\u2014 afferting perhaps more than 15 percent of the population. Despite the absence of a folk tradition naming and explaining it, many of the specific details of the Old Hag hallucination recurred in victims' experiences, leaving them profoundly confused and reluctant to talk for fear of ridicule. Hence the phenomenon remains largely unstudied by psychologists and practically un\u00ad known (as a general phenomenon) to the general public. Surveying the psychological and psychiatric literature relating to the experience, Hufford found no evidence that the Old Hag was linked to neurological or psychotic illnesses. During this event, evidently, the brain functions as if asleep, producing the characteristic paralysis and apnea; hence it is similar to the hypnogogic hallucination (Baker 1987-88). The peculiar stability of the hallucinations' content across cultural boundaries and in the absence of traditions concerning it, however, remains unexplained. Hufford suggests that the most likely explanation is that the Old Hag might be the side-effect of a documented but poorly understood derangement of the sleep pattern, akin to narcolepsy. Strieber's October 4 visitation, along with the similar experiences of paralysis and physical manipulation reported by many abductees, might be explained by some form of abnormal sleep pattern, producing a distinctive set of hallucinatory events. Future studies need to focus carefully on the phenomenology of such events, which may reveal genuine correspondences among \"abduction\" events. In this regard, the main value of Strieber's book to folklorists is that much of it was committed to writing soon after the Spring 1988 265 experiences themselves. The interpretations accepted after the fact by the victim (or imposed on him by others) are of less value, as they tend to force the details of the experience into a culturally acceptable mold. On the other hand, it is not necessary to assume that a neurological experience could provoke detailed memories of abduction. Strieber may have confabulated either or both experiences; we cannot tell for sure. Nevertheless, there is no question that early in 1986 Strieber underwent a quasi-religious conversion, assisted (probably innocently) by Budd Hopkins and his analyst, Robert Klein. The classic process of indoctrination is described by William Sargant (1961): When the human nervous system is stimulated beyond its normal capacity (\"transmarginally\") for long periods of time\u2014either deliberately by agents wanting to indoctrinate a person or unintentionally by the person undergoing a lengthy period of psychological stress\u2014it eventually begins to operate in paradoxical ways. Typically, the individual begins to over-respond to weak stimuli; ultimately, his or her previous thought and behavior patterns begin to change and a state of hysteria results, during which the individual is highly susceptible to new concepts and philosophies. It is unrealistic, Sargant warns, to expect a person to resist the process of conversion once it has begun. Even recognition that one is being indoctrinated, he notes, may not delay breakdown. This process has been institutionalized in the religious rites of many cultures (Turner 1969), and the pattern frequently occurs in the narratives of \"born-again\" Christians (Clements 1982). Strieber's account of events, evi\u00ad dently based on a journal kept before and during his hypnotic sessions, is structurally identical to such narratives. In January we find him in psycho\u00ad logical disarray, alienated from his wife, unable to read or write, and suffering from a variety of physical symptoms. At this point, Strieber tells us, images began to float into his mind. In a state of extreme suggestibility, then, Strieber began reading and talking to friends about UFOs, a process climaxing with his discovery of an account of an abduction experience that contained some minor correspondences with the images he was \"recalling.\" This point of contact evidently led to a psychological crisis a few days later: ... I was sitting at my desk when things just seemed to cave in on me. Wave after wave of sorrow passed over me. I looked at the window with hunger. I wanted to jump. I wanted to die. I just could not bear this memory, and I could not get rid of it. (Strieber 1987, p. 40) At this precise moment, Strieber contacted Hopkins, who gave him assurances that his memories were indeed similar to those of others. Strieber wept in relief and \"went from wanting to hide it all to wanting to understand it.\" Then Hopkins introduced the idea of looking for a previous encounter, and Strieber\u2014for the first time\u2014began to look at the October 4 events as possibly paranormal. Given this task, Strieber left this interview \"a happy man\" (Strieber 1987, p. 41). 266 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Sargant's research leaves little doubt that Strieber was, when he contacted Hopkins, transmarginally excited. Loss of sleep combined with obsessive, uncontrollable thought patterns \"overloaded\" his brain and left him suscepti\u00ad ble to the slightest idea that would give his anxieties a licit avenue. Further, the extreme significance put on small details\u2014the slim correspondences that suddenly seem concrete proof of the visitations' reality\u2014exhibits the para\u00ad doxical phase of this process. In Strieber's words, \"There did seem to be a lot of confusion . .. and perhaps even an emotional response on my part greatly out of proportion to what seemed a minor disturbance\" (Strieber 1987, p. 51). \"Strieber may have fallen into the abductees3 camp to find convenient cultural language for a psychological event that otherwise would have to be labeled {fraud*or 'madness,9 \" It is not surprising that the hint provided by Hopkins led to the intense moment during Strieber's first hypnosis session in which he suddenly \"remem\u00ad bered\" the little man by his bed and responded with 20 seconds of prolonged screams. This reaction, common to many other hypnotized \"abductees,\" represents the moment of abreaction, in which the convert's pent-up emotions are released in a controlled way through emotionally reliving the event that the indoctrinator (in this case, Hopkins) has suggested actually caused the anxieties. This process has been used therapeutically since World War II to treat stubborn cases of battle shock and trauma. Significantly, Sargant reports, it was found that it was not necessary to make the patient recall real-life incidents. Rather, \"it would often be enough to create in him a state of excitement analogous to that which had caused his neurotic condition and keep it up until he collapsed; he would then start to improve. Thus imagina\u00ad tion would have to be used in inventing artificial situations, or distorting actual events. .. .\" (Sargant 1961, p. 51; emphasis added). Recognizing this pattern in Communion explains why Strieber acts less like a playful hoaxer than a religious convert. Indeed, judging from psy\u00ad chological tests, the conversion experience largely restored his mental health, dispelling his self-destructive tendencies and restoring his writing abilities. Further, Strieber was left with the status of a \"chosen one\" and a mission whose quasi-religious nature is explicit in the book's title. From a folklorist's perspective, the two alternatives are not mutually exclusive; indeed, a confusing neurological attack may require a conversion experience to dispel the anxiety produced. Henry James, Sr., we note, took the first steps toward regaining his mental health when he learned from a certain Mrs. Chichester that the encounter he had had with evil was known among Swedenborgians as \"vastation\" (Edel 1953, p. 32). And, Hufford (1982, p. 161) reports, one surgeon unnerved by an Old Hag experience was literally Spring 1988 267 <cWe need to admit that sane, intelligent people may sincerely perceive, or come to believe, that they have been attacked or abducted by paranormal agents.\" reduced to tears when he found it described in psychological literature as \"idiopathic SP.\" Strieber may, then, have fallen into the abductees' camp exactly for the reasons he describes: to find convenient cultural language for a psychological event that otherwise would have to be labeled \"fraud\" or \"madness.\" If Strieber sincerely believes that he is not consciously fabricating his experience, and if he is not mentally ill, then the hard-line rationalist position, as stated by Taves, gives him no alternative but to proceed on the assumption that the aliens are real. We actually leave him no other psycho\u00ad logically sound option. The pity is, though, that concepts like \"vastation\" or \"Old Hag\" derive from cultural systems with complex psychological checks and balances. To accept the Newfoundland conception of Old Hag, for instance, one must also accept the reality of witchcraft. But the tradition also comes prepared with countercharms\u2014sleeping with a sharp knife, for instance\u2014known to be effec\u00ad tive against repeat attacks (Hufford 1982, pp. 3-4; Hyatt 1965, pp. 270, 273). Such a practice, like any fetish, would materially reduce the anxieties of the victim (though perhaps not those of his bedmate). The concept \"alien abduc\u00ad tion,\" by contrast, leaves the victim unprotected against future visits, which no open knives, strings of garlic, burglar alarms, or concentrated skeptical thought patterns can repel. So accepting the concept may immediately reduce anxieties, but at the cost of inviting recurrent attacks. The progress of Strieber's \"visitations\" after his conversion shows him gaining some degree of psychological control over his visitors\u2014making the visionary face move as he pleases or, in the last scene, actually inviting them to return so that he can show his lack of fear. But it is unclear whether his missionary role will communicate the same control to other troubled souls who may have experienced\u2014or who may find relief in \"remembering\"\u2014 similar events. If the Triad Group that Strieber has formed to collect and analyze abduction accounts actually turns over to qualified professionals a corpus of similar experiences, some good may come from Strieber's mis\u00ad sionary work. Competent psychologists may be able to examine the phe\u00ad nomenology of the events described and determine more exactly what mechanisms lie behind them. This in turn may suggest more specific and appropriate psychological treatment for the victims. Time will tell. In the meantime, the rationalist community needs to be cautious not to commit itself too quickly to a presumption of fraud. Even Baker, as sym\u00ad pathetic as he is to abductees, still suggests that books based on their accounts should be labeled \"science fiction,\" a move that has the effect of calling their stories conscious fictions. Perhaps rationalists (and bookstores) ought to abandon the simple dualism of classifying narratives into \"fiction\" and \"non- 268 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER fiction\" and follow folklorists in their more complex scheme: \"tale\" (conscious fantasy), \"history\" (unquestionable fact), and\u2014in the middle\u2014\"legend\" (alleged but disputable fact). The need of Strieber and other abductees to hedge their accounts with proofs of their veracity is itself proof of the debat\u00ad able status of their narratives, just as oral accounts of ghosts, manlike apes, and other anomalous phenomena are spiked with details, corroborations, and even disclaimers, to the point of losing the forward motion of the story (Bennett 1988). Sargant (1961, p. 233) notes that a sense of humor is one of the surest blocks to conversion, and mirth is doubtless our first line of defense against works like Communion that convey a patently missionary message. But humor, like an oversharpened razor carelessly used, may turn on its user. We need to admit that sane, intelligent people may sincerely perceive, or come to believe, that they have been attacked or abducted by paranormal agents. In the case of persons who (like Strieber and, before him, the Hills) seem to be objectively disturbed by memories of abduction, the proper response is not amusement but concern\u2014not over the risk of UFO invaders, but over the treatment of such victims. We should insist that they receive appropriate professional evaluation and treatment. Otherwise such victims will continue, as we all must, to adjust to life at a high level of uncertainty. At present this means they will seek out those who will listen to their experiences without assuming they are either lying or mentally ill. Unfortunately this leads them to the UFOlogists, whose sympathy inevitably must be less for the suffering individuals than for the value their testimony may have for supporting the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Whether this price is a fair one for maintaining our own fiction that \"intelligent\" people do not experience apparently paranormal events, I leave the skeptical community to decide.

Spring 1988 269 Alien-Abduction Claims And Standards of Inquiry The following discussion of recent alien-abduction claims and the use of appropriate standards of investigation and scientific reasoning in examining such stories is excerpted from an edited transcript of \"Extension 720, \"a radio talk-show program on WGN-Radio in Chicago. The host of the show is Milton Rosenberg, professor of psychology and chairman of the graduate program in social psychology at the University of Chicago. His guests were Charles L. Gruder, professor and chairman of the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago; Budd Hopkins, author of Intruders, a book based on Hopkins's interviews with alleged \"abductees\"; and (by tele\u00ad phone) Martin Orne, professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. Milton Rosenberg: Larry, if you were a consultant for Random House and they called and said, \"Professor Gruder, we have a manuscript we want you to read. We want to get your evaluation as a social psychologist interested in the dynamics of human interaction as that might affect research findings. Give us a critical reading of Mr. Hopkins's book before we decide whether or not to publish it.\" What would you have told them after completing the reading? Charles (Larry) Gruder: I would want to keep it at arm's length probably. It's not the kind of thing that scientists turn to easily. It poses very difficult questions, and it's easy to dismiss them. One of the points in the book that I take issue with is whether skeptics are really believers\u2014believers that this can't possibly happen. I don't doubt that all of us try to keep it at a distance, but I think true skeptics\u2014and I would count myself in their number\u2014would look for answers using what we know are the best, soundest scientific tools. I would have many problems with your [Hopkins's] methodology, your way of gathering data, and your way of interpreting data. You touch on many important factors in doing this kind of research: the nature of observation, the nature of measurement, the reliability of the measures. You're obviously sensitive to the issue of biasing the people you're interviewing. Yet I saw many places in the book where I would have problems accepting the data. Rosenberg: List those problems. Let's put them on the table. You're a gentleman and you've approached this in a very gentle way; but to come directly to the case, what do you see to be the major methodological problems and interpretative flaws? Gruder: One of the issues is quite important in science, and that's repeat- 270 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER ability or reliability. You [Hopkins] say that one of the factors in these cases that convinces you is that similar experiences keep coming up. For example, people describe the craft\u2014the UFO\u2014in the same way; they tend to describe the aliens in the same way. Well, being a behavioral scientist and an empiricist, I decided that I was going to collect some data myself. So I asked a number of students to draw a UFO and an alien. I didn't tell them why I wanted them to. They didn't know I would be here talking with you or that I was reading Intruders. I looked at their drawings, and it was surprising that many were quite similar to the drawings in the book. How can this be? \"The layperson believes that hypnosis is a very powerful, somewhat mystical technique for getting at the truth. Unfortunately it is not.\" \u2014Charles L. Gruder Budd Hopkins: I don't think that's surprising at all. Gruder: Well, it isn't surprising, because how do people know what a UFO should look like? They read the same stories, the same magazines, see the same science-fiction movies. You mentioned a particular shape of the head, or the fact that the mouth was a line. I found that most of these drawings were of humanoids. Of the 23, 18 were humanlike. Of these, one- third had big heads, one-third had a line for a mouth. I figured out that most people who are not artists don't know how to draw a mouth so they draw a line. There were no drawings that looked exactly like the pictures in the book, but there were many similarities. It was the same with the UFOs. Hopkins: I should mention, of course, that Allen Hynek had many draw\u00ad ings that he gave to Steven Spielberg for use when he made Close Encounters of the Third Kind\u2014 which was of course one of the biggest box office successes of all time. There was a serious attempt to follow the data that Allen Hynek and other people had gathered. So I think you can say that Steven Spielberg popularized the essential physical type that the UFO reports had engendered before that time. Rosenberg: Let me raise a very basic question. It touches on methodology and on the substantive aspects of this study as well. There are subjects who are somewhat disturbed but don't quite know what happened until you submit them to hypnotic induction and hypnotic regression. Then they produce versions of this by now rather standard tale of somebody being picked up, taken onto a spaceship, and given a medical examination. Now we have the extra finding from Budd Hopkins's investigations that the purpose of the medical examination is to perform artificial insemination that will blend the two species, the earthbound and the visiting species. Now Larry, is there a parsimonious way of interpreting the fact that so many people under hypnotic regression come up with the same memories\u2014with essentially the same story? Gruder: There certainly is a more parsimonious explanation. Budd does Spring 1988 271 use hypnotic regression as a technique and thereby elicits memories. One of the effects of stressing the hypnotic recovery of these memories is that it lends credibility. The lay person believes that hypnosis is a very powerful, somewhat mystical technique for getting at the truth. Unfortunately, it is not. The evidence is absolutely clear that hypnosis does not refresh memory. We know this not so much because of investigations into UFOs and aliens but because of extensive use of hypnosis over the past 20 or 25 years in the legal system in investigations of crimes and also in the courtroom. I know you have cited the AMA report. The AMA report makes it clear that there is no evidence that in fact hypnosis can effectively refresh memory. What hypnosis appears to do is to increase the number of recollections people report; and, as you correctly say, these include both accurate and inaccurate recollections. Another in\u00ad teresting feature of hypnosis in refreshing memory is that subjects are less able to distinguish the accurate from the inaccurate reports than if they were not hypnotized. Rosenberg: If you have inaccurate memories recalled only under hypnosis, what would be the source of their content? Gruder: One of the things they think happens under hypnosis when you're trying to refresh memory is what they call \"confabulation,\" or pseudomemo- ries. The subject transforms prior beliefs into thoughts or fantasies that they come to accept as memories. . .. Hopkins: I also have a quote from the American Medical Association report: \"In the case of fugues, in which an individual forgets his identity, hypnosis can be an effective clinical procedure to help the person recover his identity. When used in this manner, hypnosis may serve to reinstate the individual's former recollections.\" And of course we have something quite analogous to this in these UFO cases. Furthermore, in 14 of the cases I worked with, the recollections were very complete through the whole UFO experience, without hypnosis having been employed. Hypnosis is not in any sense essential to these although it seems to be essential in a large number of them. So we have a case where what's recalled under hypnosis and what's recalled normally are very similar. But even more important than that, I think we're sort of picking up the dog by the wrong end. The thing is that we talk about whether or not hypnotic recollection is accurate. I don't think hypnotic recollection is very different from normal, nonhypnotic recollection, which is not necessarily valid either. I don't see that we should necessarily take in a court of law someone's eyewit\u00ad ness report of something that occurred very quickly, [for example under] gunfire at a bank as somebody runs out; we know that under those conditions a person can misinterpret a lot of things. I think that we have problems of just normal observation, normal recollection, in any kind of case worth investigating at all. The situation of hypnosis, I think, simply adds more of those recollections, which can be just as bad or just as good. Rosenberg: I want to put a proposition to the two of you. It's terribly simple. With such memories\u2014whether you recover them by hypnosis or by direct, fully conscious interchange between the person who claims to have 272 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER had the experience and the person who is interviewing him or her\u2014what you're probably dealing with is a pervasive modern myth that has been much propagandized, circulated, and diffused through the telling and the retelling and the re-retelling of the story. The more it's told, the more all kinds of people on the border are prone to pick up the myth and share it with others. ccWhat you're probably dealing with here is a pervasive modern myth, propagandized, circulated, and diffused through its telling and retelling.\" \u2014Milton Rosenberg I don't mean on the border of nuttiness. I mean on the border of confusion about their own lives, their own past, and maybe with some present emotional crisis or merely some unbearable loneliness. In that state, they could be lying. More typically they are probably attempting to grope their way out of their own confused identity toward some order and meaning by having this \"recall,\" which grows upon itself and becomes a spun fantasy. But the fact that the stories are similar from one to another across maybe a set of hundreds of cases would suggest that they are all drawing upon past versions of the story they have encountered. That some investigators take it seriously and find confirmation suggests to me that some of these investigators\u2014and Budd, I say this with all due regard to your utter sincerity\u2014don't fully honor, perhaps because they haven't been fully trained in them, the hard canons of empirical science. I suggest then that abduction and extraterrestrial impregnation comprise a modern myth. Indeed, it is a bit of urban folklore, to use the term that has been employed for certain kinds of stories that circulate as having happened to somebody who is the best friend of my cousin's wife's aunt. My view then is that the easiest explanation of all of this, of your research and lots of other research of the same sort, is that the subjects are credulous and susceptible and have picked up a modern myth; and for one or another reason they find it valuable to themselves, or tension-reducing for themselves, to give you back that myth as if it really happened to them. Often, of course, they have convinced themselves in and through the telling. Hopkins: Well, we'll leave aside a lot of problems with your theory, such as the physical evidence, the fact this might happen to four, five, or six people at once, simultaneously, with the same descriptions, and so forth. But this is the basic problem. I think it's a wonderful theory you've brought up. It's been looked into before. People ask, \"Exactly what is this modern myth, how does it get to us, how does it turn up in science fiction?\" I go into this at some length in the book, that there are two essential modern myths of extraterrestrial contact. One is the space-brother myth and the other is the paranoid myth of destruction from outer space. These are extremely common, and they have been the basis of most of our films. Close Encounters was of Spring 1988 273 course an example of the space-brothers myth. Finally they land, and it's all quite wonderful. What we're getting at here is something totally, absolutely neutral. One of the psychologists who has done interviews with people whom I've worked with\u2014quite a few of them\u2014said to me, \"Why would anyone fantasize a thing like this?\" It doesn't give you the satisfaction of a paranoid image where you struggle against overwhelming odds and evils that are following you. On the other hand, it doesn't give you the satisfaction of having been chosen for some wonderful quasi-religious role in the world. In fact, you have been turned into a kind of neutered, powerless figure with no autonomy whatever. Rosenberg: Maybe it gives representation to your deep feeling that you are a powerless figure who is abused in the world. Hopkins: Now that is very interesting, because this is exactly why we need a lot of psychological help in investigating these cases. One can test exactly the statement you made by doing psychological therapy, psychoanalysis, whatever. One of the projects I would like to see\u2014and I would fund this myself if my book makes any money\u2014would be to take a few of our abductees whose accuracy I have enormous faith in\u2014I don't like to believe in their accuracy, but I'm forced to\u2014and submit them to psychotherapy with someone who came from any point of view whatsoever psychologically, [including] the position you just stated, and see after a period of perhaps two or three years of very thoroughgoing psychoanalysis and psychological testing whether the theory you stated has any basis in reality. Rosenberg: But the immediate issue before us is to formulate a parsi\u00ad monious hypothesis\u2014one that meets the requirements of Occam's Razor, the general rule in science that one should explain things as simply as possible, making as few assumptions as possible. I think I have offered a parsimonious explanation that cannot be rejected by the available evidence. What do you think, Larry? Gruder: I think that that's one. As I said earlier, I am a skeptic in the sense that I'm not willing to accept any hypothesis, regardless of how plausible or reasonable or implausible or unreasonable it is, until I see some convincing evidence. Convincing evidence is evidence that meets the scientific standards that are generally accepted. I don't think the evidence that you [Hopkins] provide in your book meets that, and so I can't accept it. But it doesn't mean that I couldn't if I had the right evidence. Rosenberg: What would the right evidence be? Gruder: The research would have to be designed to eliminate some of the problems we talked about earlier, possibilities of biasing. You [Hopkins] have interviewed most of these people. Many have read about what you've done, which is how they get to you, and they may already be influenced toward your view. One of the features of hypnosis is that people are more suggestible. You told us earlier that you recognize this and tried to avoid the problems. But even the most well-intentioned person, even the most well- intentioned scientist, knows you can't avoid producing this kind of bias in an interpersonal exchange. 274 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Rosenberg: That is to say you lead and cue them not because you intend to deceive but because your own desire to have your own hypothesis con\u00ad firmed affects the way you deal with them. \".. . The individual whose story is a response to the demands of the hypnotic situation truly believes that what he tells you must be true, though he has not known it before,\"\u2014Martin Orne Gruder: There are other parsimonious explanations, and this is part of one: namely, that you have attracted and have focused on people who tend to confirm your hypothesis. In fact, you say that after you had appeared on a television show, or a radio show, you got hundreds and hundreds of calls, and many letters in response to the book. Hopkins: Hundreds of letters. Gruder: The point is that you focused only on certain ones, those you said you had judged to be more plausible. Well, immediately you're selecting out, and that was my point with my little experiment. There were lots of descriptions and lots of drawings of different types of UFOs and different types of aliens, but some were what you were looking for, and I could have picked ones that meant something else. Hopkins: Well, I wouldn't ever worry about that, since the film Close Encounters based itself on the case material and was one of the biggest box- office hits of all time. Now here's the point: If your theory is right, this is a social phenomenon and there is some kind of collective myth. We can study the science fiction, the popular imagery that we've been shown; and I described it, I think accurately, as falling into those two groups. As far as I know, there has only been one film ever made that really dealt with, let's say, the scenario that appears in my book. Rosenberg: The immediate issue before us is: Are these veridical accounts? From the stories that have been elicited from these various respondents\u2014by hypnosis or by other modes of inquiry\u2014can we conclude that alien invaders have been landing, snatching up people, and submitting them to medical examination, and furthermore that these medical procedures involve a forced intermingling of the two gene pools? Hopkins: All I can say is I don't try to prove anything in this book. I don't think I can prove anything to anybody. That is not my goal. I'm doing exactly at this very moment what I wanted to do. I'm bringing this to the attention of scientists. I can blow it all away by saying: \"It's just unbelievable. I just can't believe it. Who can believe it?\" That isn't the point. I would like from both of you a set of proposals about how to go about investigating a particular, specific case. Rosenberg: We might put the question not only to Larry Gruder but also to another guest via telephone. This guest is probably the most eminent Spring 1988 275 student of hypnosis in the country, Dr. Martin Orne, who holds both an M.D. and a Ph.D., and is professor of psychiatry and psychology at the University of Pennsylvania. The AMA panel on hypnosis and its use in the courts, which Larry Gruder referred to earlier, was chaired, in fact, by Martin Orne. Martin, I'm very glad you could join us. The basic question I would raise is: What about the use of hypnosis and other modes of inquiry with people who give reports of having been abducted and medically examined on landed extraterrestrial vehicles? Martin Orne: To get all of that in perspective, we could go back to when Freud used hypnosis with hysterics at the turn of the century. When he hypnotized them and asked them to remember the time they first had the symptom, they would remember things with intense effect and they would relive typically something that seemed to be a seduction by an adult male, usually their fathers. And Freud actually developed his theory of hysteria based upon these observations. It appeared that not only did people seemingly remember all kinds of things that you couldn't know if you weren't there\u2014a facial expression, a torn tapestry, a picture that's crooked, all kinds of things like that\u2014they also, when they woke up afterward, felt a lot better. They lost the symptom. It's for that reason that Freud argued that this really was a reliving of a past event. He put forth this view at the time and it has stayed with us to the present day. Actually, he himself realized within a couple of years that these weren't actual memories, that they were mixtures of memories, fears, fantasies, hopes\u2014all kinds of things mixed up. Rosenberg: Now show me exactly how you go from that to the question of the hypnotic recall of people who claim they've been abducted onto UFOs. Orne: Well, you know we can't really look at the accuracy of the subjects' descriptions of the UFOs and their occupants because these beings aren't nice enough to come on television. So we don't see them. But you can ask, \"What about the accuracy of memories that you recall, going back to when you were six and before that? How accurate is your memory when you relive it in age regression?\" I did the first study of this type back in 1951. For the first time, we actually got the drawings somebody did when he was six years old, which he hadn't seen since then. His father had saved everything the little boy did as he grew up. He had some drawings in the attic that his son had done at age six, of a house, a teepee, a man, a number of things. So we age-regressed the individual. He hadn't seen those drawings and to that day he hadn't drawn the same things. We asked him to draw a house, a tree, a man, and so forth. His drawings looked great. It seemed as if he actually relived it. Two weeks later we repeated it. He gave us a somewhat different drawing, but again it looked really like a child's work. And then when we compared it to the real thing, it became clear that it was totally different. If you didn't have the real thing, it would have looked as if it were an actual recollection and reliving. Now we have a good deal of data along this line that shows that what people remember is not an accurate recall. It is something that is emotionally 276 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER accurate. That's why it is very useful in psychotherapy, but it isn't what really happened. Rosenberg: Now what kind of emotional utility might one get through adopting the \"abduction onto a UFO\" myth? For those who recover that memory through hypnosis or through other inquiry, what sort of resolution of what kind of deeper conflict just might be involved? It's a matter of speculation, of course, but what are your speculations? <CI don't try to prove anything in this book.... I'm bringing this to the attention of scientists.\" \u2014Budd Hopkins Orne: There are a lot of secondary gains. For one thing, you've become the object of interest of a significant person, a psychiatrist who has some high status, and he will spend hours and hours with you working out what those little green men did to you. He is fascinated by it. We all love an audience, and we get a fascinated audience and become the center of attention. Many of these people don't have much to attract people interpersonally, and now they suddenly become celebrities. Gruder: Hypnosis has been used to emphasize that everything we experi\u00ad ence is recorded in memory, as though it were on a videotape, and that all we need to get it out is hypnosis itself. Thus there is a tremendous demand on these people to produce something, which is one reason perhaps that we find with hypnosis that you generate more recollection. But it is a false model of memory as well as a false model of hypnosis. The system is just too fallible to rely on for the kind of evidence we need to convince us of a particular explanation of the phenomenon. Orne: Precisely. But I'd like to go just a step further. Not only does hypnosis cause you to do that, but it also causes you to become more convinced about what is talked about. That's the most interesting thing. You see, hypnosis causes less accurate memories, but the individual believes that they're more accurate than their waking recollections. That's a really fas\u00ad cinating thing. . . . The individual whose story is a response to the demands of the hypnotic situation truly believes that what he tells you must be true even though he may not have known it before. Hopkins: We have two basic options here; they're very simple. We can make this go away by saying I can amass a sufficient amount of theory around it to blanket it completely and smother it. And the other is simply to say I find it intriguing enough that I would like to actually work with these people and investigate their situations, their cases, with every kind of psy\u00ad chological and physiological tool that we can use. ***** Spring 1988 277 Rosenberg: As we end our discussion, Larry, do you feel any temptation toward a hemidemisemiquaver of persuasion in the direction of Budd Hop\u00ad kins's argument? Gruder: I don't feel that there's any evidence that supports his explanation of the experiences these people had. I don't doubt that these people had experiences and that they are fascinating from the point of view of a lay person or a psychologist. They're certainly worthy of explanation. Rosenberg: What can we learn from this book? If you were to use it in a classroom at the University of Illinois, you'd use it for what purpose, to make what point? Gruder: If I were to use it, I would use it as a tool to teach scientific methodology, because it demonstrates all of the problems involved in doing science, as a social scientist and as a psychologist: observation, measurement, reliability, validity, the problems in conducting experiments and of gathering data\u2014demand characteristics, experimenter bias, evaluation apprehension, controls. All of these issues are present in the book and would provide probably a very compelling example for students. It would keep them in\u00ad volved. Rosenberg: What you apparently mean, but haven't directly said, is that this book is a perfect example of errors in all of those areas. Gruder: Certainly, but Budd recognizes and has admitted that he is not a scientist. He doesn't claim to be. What disturbs me about it, if anything disturbs me, is just that the presentation is as though the book were scientific, and in fact it's not. For further discussion of these claims and the issues surrounding them, see the reviews of Budd Hopkins's Intruders and of Whitley Strieber's Com\u00ad munion in Fall 1987 issue; psychologist Robert A. Baker's article \"The Aliens Among Us,\" in our Winter 1987-88 issue; articles on misperceptions about hypnosis, by Nicholas Spanos and Peter Reveen, also in our Winter issue; and of course the article in this issue by folklorist Bill Ellis, \"The Varieties of Alien Experience. \"\u2014THE EDITOR 278 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER This is the second of two articles. The MJ-12 Papers: Part 2 Further evidence that these documents are counterfeit Philip J. Klass NUMEROUS FLAWS and inconsistencies in the \"Top Secret/Eyes Only\" MJ-12 document, allegedly written by Rear Admiral R. H. Hillenkoetter on November 18, 1952, to brief President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower about crashed flying saucers, provide further evidence, beyond that discussed in Part 1 of this report (SI, Winter 1987-88), that the document is a counterfeit. The document, made public in late May 1987 by UFOlogist William L. Moore, supports his earlier claims of a 1947 crashed saucer made in the book The Roswell Incident, which he coauthored with Charles Berlitz in 1980, based on research conducted by Moore and UFOlogist Stanton T. Friedman. One obvious anomaly is that the introductory portion of the Hillenkoetter/ Eisenhower briefing document is written as if Eisenhower had never been informed that a crashed saucer (allegedly) had been recovered in New Mexico on July 7, 1947, by Army officers while Eisenhower was Army chief of staff. Moore made a similar claim in his book. Yet historical records turned up by Moore himself show that only two days after the alleged crashed-saucer recovery Eisenhower spent more than two hours with Lt. Gen. Lauris Norstad, a top Army Air Force (AAF) official. Surely General Norstad would not withhold word of so momentous an event from his commanding officer, who would be responsible for defend\u00ad ing the nation if the crashed saucer was the precursor of an extraterrestrial attack. Later that same day, July 9, Lt. Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg, AAF vice chief of staff, who Moore claims knew of the crashed saucer, attended a two-hour meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in which Eisenhower participated. Yet the contents of the Hillenkoetter document imply that General Vandenberg also Philip J. Klass, a veteran aerospace editor in Washington, is chairman of CSICOP's UFO Subcommittee and author of UFOs: The Public Deceived and UFOs Ex\u00ad plained, among other books. His new book, UFO-Abductions: A Dangerous Game, has just been released by Prometheus Books. Spring 1988 279 withheld news of recovery of a crashed saucer from the nation's top military officials. Stanton Friedman has attempted to explain this anomaly by pointing out that a month before the (alleged) recovery of the crashed saucer Eisenhower had announced that he would retire later that year to become president of William L. Moore [left), who made public the MJ-12 documents, which seemingly confirmed the 1947 crashed-saucer recovery featured in a book he coauthored in 1980, and Stanton T. Friedman, his principal collaborator, endorsed authenticity of MJ-12 documents at 1987 MUFON Conference in Washington. Columbia University. Although Eisenhower remained on duty as one of the nation's top military officers for another six months, Friedman claims that information on the crashed saucer was withheld from him because of his pending retirement. According to the Hillenkoetter briefing document, \"Numerous examples of what appear to be a form of writing were found in the wreckage. Efforts to decipher these have remained largely unsuccessful. Equally unsuccessful have been efforts to determine the method of propulsion or the nature or method of transmission of the power source involved. Research along these lines has been complicated by the complete absence of identifiable wings, propellers, jets, or other conventional methods of propulsion and guidance, as well as a total lack of metallic wiring, vacuum tubes, or similar recognizable electronic components.\" (Emphasis added.) As a result, the document reports, \"it is virtually certain that these craft do not originate in any country on earth. . . .\" (Based on the described characteristics, it should have been absolutely obvious and certain that the craft could not have been built on Earth.) The briefing document notes that the \"implications for the National Security are of continuing importance in that the motives and ultimate inten\u00ad tions of these visitors remain completely unknown. In addition, a significant upsurge in the surveillance activity of these craft beginning in May [1952] and continuing through the autumn of this year has caused considerable 280 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER concern that new developments may be imminent.\" The document completely fails to mention that UFOs seemingly had been spotted near the nation's capital quite recently\u2014July 19-20 and again on July 26-27\u2014on radar scopes at Washington's National Airport, only a few miles from the White House and the Pentagon. One should expect that Hillen- koetter would have begun his briefing by citing these specific and potentially alarming incidents that could indicate possible hostile intent. Instead, Hillenkoetter began his briefing by discussing historical trivia, such as the first UFO sighting report by pilot Kenneth Arnold. Another example: the document describes the (alleged) history of Majestic-12: OPERATION MAJESTIC-12 is a TOP SECRET Research and Development/ Intelligence operation responsible directly and only to the President of the United States. Operations of the project are carried out under control of the Majestic-12 (Majic-12) Group which was established by special classified execu\u00ad tive order of President Truman on 24 September, 1947, upon recommendation by Dr. Vannevar Bush and Secretary [of Defense] James Forrestal. (See Attach\u00ad ment \"A.\") Members of the Majestic-12 Group were designated as follows: Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter Dr. Jerome Hunsaker Dr. Vannevar Bush Mr. Sidney W. Souers Secy. James V. Forrestal Mr. Gordon Gray Gen. Nathan F. Twining Dr. Donald Menzel Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg Gen. Robert M. Montague Dr. Detlev Bronk Dr. Lloyd V. Berkner A footnote states: \"The death of Secretary Forrestal on 22 May, 1949, created a vacancy which remained unfilled until 01 August, 1950, upon which date Gen. Walter B. Smith was designated as permanent replacement.\" The Hillenkoetter document never identifies who was chairman of MJ-12, although his being selected to give the briefing and a designation \"MJ-1\" after his name (where he is listed as the briefer) implies he was its chairman. (No such designation is shown for others.) Yet, if Dr. Bush played a key role in organizing such a group, logically he would have been named chairman. The names are not listed in alphabetical or any other logical sequence. Hillenkoetter seemingly lists himself as \"Adm. Roscoe H. Hillenkoetter,\" even though examination of authentic letters that he wrote while director of the CIA, obtained from the Truman Library, show that he used his initials \"R. H.\" and not \"Roscoe.\" Further, in these authentic letters he correctly showed his rank as \"Rear Admiral,\" not \"Admiral,\" whereas the briefing document implies he was a \"full admiral\" with four-star rank. Five of those listed as original members of the alleged MJ-12 were highly respected scientists\u2014Bush, Bronk, Hunsaker, Menzel, and Berkner, presum\u00ad ably selected because of their technical expertise. Thus, if MJ-12 existed, they would be likely to remain on the committee (except possibly for Bush, for reasons to be discussed shortly). General Vandenberg, as vice chief of staff in 1947 of the newly created Spring 1988 281 U.S. Air Force, who would soon become chief of staff and hold that position until he retired in mid-1953, would also be a logical original member who would likely remain on M J-12 because of the USAFs vital role in protecting the nation's air space and operating its network of early-warning radars. But others listed as original members of MJ-12 would have been named to the group because of the positions they held as of September 1947, when MJ-12 was created. When they left these posts for other assignments or retired from government, their successors in those posts would logically have replaced them on MJ-12. Yet that did not occur, according to the briefing document. For example, James Forrestal as secretary of defense would logically be named to MJ-12 in 1947. But when Forrestal resigned in the spring of 1949 (shortly before committing suicide on May 22) the new defense secretary, Louis A. Johnson, would have been his logical replacement on MJ-12. Instead, the Hillenkoetter document claims that Forrestal's vacancy was not filled for more than a year and that his replacement was Gen. Walter B. Smith. But at that time General Smith was replacing Hillenkoetter as director of the CIA, and thus logically should have taken Hillenkoetter's place on MJ-12, not Forrestal's. When Hillenkoetter left the CIA in the fall of 1950, he returned to active duty in the Pacific as commander of the Seventh Fleet in Formosan Waters, a post he held for more than a year. Thus he would be far removed from Washington and could not readily direct the important work of an MJ-12 committee\u2014if he originally had been its chairman. If he was not its chairman, why would Hillenkoetter be selected in late 1952 to brief Eisenhower? In the intervening year since he returned to the United States in the fall of 1951, he had served as commander of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and later of the Third Naval District, in New York. (The reason for Hillenkoetter's being chosen by the document's counterfeiter will be disclosed shortly.) In July 1947, when the alleged crashed saucer was sent for analysis to the AAFs large technical center at Wright Field (now Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio), its commander was Lt. Gen. Nathan Twining, who is shown as an original member of MJ-12. But within several weeks after MJ-12 (allegedly) was created, Twining was transferred to Alaska to head the Alaskan Com\u00ad mand, and he remained there for more than two years before being transferred back to Washington. Surely if Twining was selected for MJ-12 because of his technical expertise, he would have stayed on at Wright-Patterson AFB to monitor analysis of the crashed saucer. Or his successor there should logically have taken his place on MJ-12. Gordon Gray, who had become assistant secretary of the army about the time that MJ-12 allegedly was created, would have been a most unlikely member based on background and position. Gray was trained as a lawyer and had spent the previous ten years as publisher of two newspapers, and he did not hold a top-ranking Pentagon position. In mid-1949, Gray was named secretary of the Army, but he resigned April 12, 1950, to return to civilian life and was succeeded in that post by Frank Pace, Jr. Yet more than two 282 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER years later, when the briefing document allegedly was written, Gray was still listed as an MJ-12 member. Sidney W. Souers might have been a logical choice as an original member of MJ-12 because on September 26, 1947, he was named executive secretary of the president's newly created National Security Council. Souers, a naval reservist, had risen to the rank of rear admiral during World War II to become deputy chief of Naval Intelligence and played a role in organizing the then-new CIA. Souers retired from his NSC position in early 1950 to return to civilian life, but he, rather than his successor at NSC, is listed in late 1952 as an MJ-12 member. Thus, according to the briefing document, as of late 1952, MJ-12's membership included two civilians who were not scientists and had since retired to civilian life. But MJ-12 failed to include the current secretary of defense, Robert A. Lovett, who should certainly have been a member because of \"implications for the National Security. ...\" At roughly the same time as the briefing document allegedly was written, the CIA was preparing to secretly convene a panel of five top scientists, headed by Dr. H. P. Robertson, of the California Institute of Technology, for a four-day study of the USAF's best UFO cases. The CIA sought this assess\u00ad ment because it was then considering launching its own UFO investigation. (How strange that CIA director Gen. Walter B. Smith, who would have known of the crashed saucer through his membership in MJ-12, would allow the CIA's top scientific officials to waste their time, and his own time in briefings, when he already knew the \"truth\" about UFOs.) By a curious coincidence, one of the five scientists selected for the CIA's UFO assessment was Lloyd V. Berkner\u2014allegedly also a member of the MJ- 12 group. If MJ-12 existed and Berkner was a member, it was a waste of his valuable time to participate in a \"make-believe\" exercise for which he already knew the answer. The final report of the \"Robertson Panel,\" which was classified \"Secret\" and signed by Berkner, concluded that there was no evidence that any UFOs were extraterrestrial craft or posed any potential threat to national security. Although two of the five members of the Robertson Panel convened in early 1953 are still alive\u2014Dr. Luis Alvarez and Dr. Thorton Page\u2014every person listed as being a member of MJ-12 in late 1952 was deceased when Moore, Friedman, and Shandera released their documents. Hillenkoetter died in 1982, two years before Moore says he received the MJ-12 papers. The briefing document, allegedly found on a roll of 35 mm film received in the mail by Moore's friend Jamie Shandera on December 11, 1984, also contains what purports to be a \"Top Secret/Eyes Only\" memorandum from President Truman to Defense Secretary Forrestal, dated September 24, 1947, asking that Forrestal and Dr. Vannevar Bush create the MJ-12 group. Although the White House letterhead and the Truman signature appear authentic, the memorandum's format and typewriter typeface differ signifi\u00ad cantly from that of copies I received from the Truman Library of other Truman memoranda written to Forrestal and other cabinet members during Spring 1988 283 that same time period. The library has no record of the alleged September 24, 1947, memorandum. (A counterfeit can easily be made by obtaining a photo\u00ad copy of an authentic Truman memo from the Truman Library, superimposing a spurious message, making a photocopy, touching it up with white typewriter correction fluid, and making another copy.) Moore, Friedman, and Shandera stress that Forrestal and Bush met with the president on the date of the purported Truman memorandum calling for the creation of MJ-12, which is true. But in reality the meeting was held to prevail upon Bush to serve as chairman of the new Defense Research and Development Board, authorized under the then-recent National Security Act of 1947. The next day, September 25, Truman announced that Bush had accepted the appointment, and Bush replied in a letter dated September 26 acknowledging his acceptance. In his letter, Bush emphasized \"my wish ultimately to be free of govern\u00ad mental duties in order to return more completely to scientific matters, and I am happy to have your assurance that you will look to the Secretary and me for a suggestion of a successor to take over my responsibilities after the new organization is well launched.\" Roughly a year later, on October 1, 1948, Bush wrote to the president to submit his resignation so he could \"give more complete attention to the affairs of Carnegie Institution of Washington.\" Yet the MJ-12 briefing docu\u00ad ment indicates that as of four years later Bush still was an active member. If President Truman knew that a crashed saucer had been recovered in July 1947, and the remains of another in late 1950, as claimed in the briefing document, certainly he would have been gravely concerned when he read the headlines in Washington newspapers on July 20, 1952, reporting that mys\u00ad terious blips had been spotted the previous night near Washington, D.C., on the scopes of an old military radar recently installed at National Airport. Although later government investigation would show the blips were the result of anomalous radar propagation conditions, surely Truman would immediately have called for a White House briefing by General Vandenberg, USAF chief of staff and member of the alleged MJ-12 group, to determine what was being done to protect the nation's capital against possible UFO attack. And certainly General Vandenberg would promptly have beefed up Washington's air defenses by rapidly shifting large numbers of interceptors to nearby military airfields. Yet one week later, when mysterious blips again appeared on the radar displays at Washington's National Airport shortly after 9:00 P.M., it was not until two hours later that the USAF's New Castle County air base in Delaware was alerted and dispatched a mere two interceptor aircraft. Two hours later, another pair of interceptors took off to replace the first two, which were running low on fuel. Thus a total of only four interceptors were launched that night to defend the nation's capital! If the president knew of crashed saucers, surely the two incidents would prompt him to quickly seek a briefing on July 27 by his MJ-12 group, and an explanation from General Vandenberg of why he had failed to promptly 284 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER provide much more air cover for the nation's capital in view of the similar incident the previous week. Yet instead, President Truman simply asked his Air Force aide, General Landry, to make a telephone inquiry to USAF intelli\u00ad gence at the Pentagon. If General Vandenberg had been so grossly derelict in his duty to try to defend the nation's capital, surely he would have been promptly replaced both as USAF chief of staff and as a member of MJ-12. Yet the briefing document indicates that General Vandenberg remained on MJ-12, and he held his top USAF post until normal retirement in mid-1953. The briefing document claims that MJ-12, with President Truman's con\u00ad currence, opted to keep the crashed saucer secret \"to avoid public panic at all costs.\" It is interesting to check this claim against Truman's reaction when he learned on September 19, 1949, that the USSR had exploded its first nuclear weapon several weeks earlier. The potential implications for the U.S. public were far more terrifying. Only four days later, on September 23, after allowing time to brief the Joint Chiefs of Staff and congressional leaders, President Truman publicly announced the first Soviet nuclear test. He quite correctly sized up public reaction and there was no panic. The launch of the first small Soviet Sputnik in October 1957, and the launch of a much larger satellite a few weeks later, prompted U.S. concern that the Soviets might someday be able to use satellites to deliver nuclear weapons from space. To enable the United States to continuously monitor all objects in space, Navy scientists developed and deployed an \"electronic fence\" \u2014stretching across the southern portion of the United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific. This Navy Space Surveillance System was so sensitive it could detect a six-inch-long metal strap released from one of our satellites. To speed deployment, the system was built using commercially available television-station transmitters and large numbers of slightly modified tele\u00ad vision-set antennas. Such a system could have been deployed in the late 1940s or early 1950s, if the United States had captured one or more crashed extra\u00ad terrestrial craft and wanted to be able to detect and monitor any future in\u00ad trusions. Yet such a space surveillance fence was not built until the late 1950s, following the launch of Sputnik. Hard evidence that the MJ-12 papers are a fraud can be found in a once \"Top Secret\" document that was declassified in 1985 at the National Archives and featured in the July 1985 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal. The document, dated 10 December 1948, was prepared by the USAF's Directorate of Intelligence and the Office of Naval Intelligence and is titled: \"Analysis of Flying Object Incidents in the U.S.\" The opening page of the top-secret report begins: \"PROBLEM: TO EXAMINE pattern of tactics of 'Flying Saucers' (hereinafter referred to as flying objects) and to develop conclusions as to the possibility of existence.\" (Emphasis added.) In other words, more than one year after the U.S. govern\u00ad ment allegedly captured a crashed saucer in New Mexico, top USAF and Navy intelligence officers were uncertain whether there really were extraor\u00ad dinary craft in our skies. Spring 1988 285 The report states, \"THE ORIGIN of the devices is not ascertainable,\" and considers two possible explanations. One is that \"the objects are domestic devices.\" The other alternative is that the \"objects are foreign, and if so, it would seem most logical to consider that they are from a Soviet source.\" The report then proceeds to focus on the possibility that UFOs are Soviet craft, possibly built with the aid of captured German scientists. This 1948 top-secret report, after citing a number of seemingly credible UFO-sighting reports, concludes: \"It is not known at this time whether these observations are misidentifications of domestically launched devices, natural phenomena, or foreign unconventional aircraft.\" The reason Hillenkoetter was selected by the counterfeiter as the alleged briefer of President-elect Eisenhower was to exploit Hillenkoetter's known involvement in the UFO movement shortly after he retired from the Navy in 1957. At that time he became a member of the board of governors of NICAP (National Investigations Committee for Aerial Phenomena), a newly formed group that would soon become the nation's largest pro-UFO group. NICAP's official position was that some UFOs were extraterrestrial craft and that the U.S. Air Force was resorting to coverup tactics to keep the truth from the public. In 1960, Hillenkoetter \"went public\" in support of NICAP's coverup charges. For example, the February 28, 1960, edition of the New York Times carried a feature article that quoted Hillenkoetter, identified as a former CIA director, as saying \"it is time for the truth [about UFOs] to be brought out in Congressional hearings.\" In an article on Hillenkoetter in the November/December 1986 issue of International UFO Reporter, published by the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS), Bruce S. Maccabee wrote: \"His [pro] UFO activities seem to make no sense in the context of official policy of the government for which he had worked for many years. Yet his actions do make sense if he sought to persuade the public that UFOs are real\u2014without revealing govern\u00ad ment secrets about UFOs.\" (The article was written some months before release of the MJ-12 papers, and I am confident that Maccabee had no involvement in their preparation.) In naming Hillenkoetter as the MJ-12 briefer, the counterfeiter sought to provide an added irony: that Hillenkoetter actually knew about two crashed saucers and seemingly joined NICAP and issued his public statements to try to break loose the secret. Yet if Hillenkoetter knew of crashed saucers through his work at the CIA and in MJ-12, he would never have dared make such public statements, lest the government terminate his retirement benefits, or worse. Surely a man skilled in intelligence would be wise enough to use \"leaks\" to a major news media reporter who would have protected his identity and retirement benefits. The addition of the name of Dr. Donald Menzel, a world-famous astron\u00ad omer and leading UFO-debunker, is an attempt at revenge by the MJ-12 counterfeiter. Menzel was hated and maligned by the \"UFO-believers\" during the first two decades of the UFO era. In the eyes of a UFO-believer, there could be only one thing worse than being a UFO-debunker\u2014and that is a 286 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER debunker who knowingly resorted to falsehood. The counterfeiter tried to heap this final indignity on a world-famous scientist, now deceased, by listing him as a member of MJ-12. (Recently I was told by one UFOIogist that he suspected that I had replaced Menzel on MJ-12 following his death.) Prior to the release of the MJ-12 papers, some members of the UFO movement considered Moore and Friedman to be among the most rigorous of researchers and investigators. Moore claims that he and his associates did not release the MJ-12 papers for more than two years while they investigated their authenticity. Moore said, in his lengthy banquet speech at the 1987 MUFON conference in Washington, that he and his associates had done \"every conceivable thing we could do.\" Moore added: \"What we found was that nothing seemed inconsistent.\" Moore said he recognized that \"maybe someone was out to embarrass us\" and that the briefing document and Truman memo (allegedly) received from an anonymous source might be \"disinformation.\" And, Moore added, \"we felt if we didn't do anything with it, maybe somebody might urge us to and [this] might give us a hint as to where it had come from.\" However, Moore said, \"we never got urged to\" make public the MJ-12 papers. This provides useful insights. If the MJ-12 papers were authentic, the person who sent them to Moore's friend Shandera in late 1984 so they could be made public might logically become impatient after a year or two and submit them to the New York Times or the Washington Post, or one of the sensationalist tabloid newspapers that feature wild UFO stories. But that did not occur. Nor did Moore or Shandera ever receive an anonymous letter urging them to make the MJ-12 papers public. If, on the other hand, the MJ-12 papers are counterfeits intended for public disinformation, how could the hoaxer be confident that Moore and his associates would not spot the discrepancies noted above and in Part 1 of this article? After so many months had elapsed since the papers (allegedly) were mailed to Shandera without being made public, the counterfeiter might logically decide that Moore et al. had concluded they were frauds and that the MJ-12 papers should now be sent to less discriminating UFOlogists or the news media. Yet this did not occur either. If the MJ-12 papers are counterfeits intended to embarrass Moore and his associates by demonstrating their inability to spot a hoax, then the counter\u00ad feiter clearly succeeded. Shortly after the MJ-12 papers were made public, Jerome Clark, editor of the International UFO Reporter, made an informal survey of UFO \"researchers whose judgments I trust\" to obtain their appraisal of the authenticity of the documents, as he reported in the May/June 1987 issue of IUR. Clark said he found only two UFOlogists who believed the MJ-12 documents were authentic: William Moore and Stanton Friedman, plus Shandera, who does not consider himself a UFOIogist. Clark admitted that \"Moore has been much less than forthcoming about his sources and his information, leading critics to charge that whatever his intentions, he has become for all practical purposes a part of the coverup\u2014a point that Moore himself probably would concede.\" Clark said that \"Moore's Spring 1988 287 promise that further (and, we would hope, better-substantiated) revelations would follow the MJ-12 release has not been fulfilled at this writing,\" i.e., mid-1987. But in the next issue of IUR, mailed in October, Clark sharply criticized CSICOP (and me) for a news release, issued August 20, 1987, that charac\u00ad terized the MJ-12 papers as a forgery. He noted that CUFOS had promptly issued a refutation \"prepared in cooperation with [Stanton] Friedman and William Moore.\" Clark admitted that the MJ-12 \"document may well be a forgery. Yet if it is, it is hardly a 'clumsy' counterfeit, as CSICOP would have us believe, but an extraordinarily skilled one, and there is no reason whatever to accuse Moore of responsibility for it.\" (CSICOP's release did not make such an accusation. Instead, it invited Moore to cooperate with CSICOP by supplying information requested earlier that could help pinpoint the hoaxer. Moore has not responded.) Clark concluded: \"What is especially troubling is that many of those who have been swept up in the wave of anti-Document [sic] hysteria are among ufology's finest and ordinarily most sensible people.\" Clark predicted that it would be possible to resolve the authenticity question \"within a few months.\" Useful insights are provided by the one-page top-secret memo that men\u00ad tions MJ-12, allegedly written to General Twining by President Eisenhower's special assistant, Robert Cutler. Moore and Shandera claim they found this Cutler/Twining memo in mid-1985 in one of more than a hundred boxes of recently declassified USAF intelligence documents in the National Archives to which they were the first to gain access. The memo purports to be an unsigned carbon copy written by Cutler on July 14, 1954, but Cutler had left the country 11 days earlier and did not return until July 15. When this and numerous other discrepancies raising doubts about authenticity appeared in a National Archives memo of July 22, 1987, Friedman's attempted explanation was that the July 14 memo had been written by Cutler's deputy, James Lay, using Cutler's name. If Friedman had checked with the Dwight D. Eisenhower Library he could have discovered that its files include a \"Top Secret\" memo to the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, written by James Lay on the same date\u2014July 14, 1954\u2014over his own name, not Cutler's. Thus, if the Twining memo had been written by Lay, as Fried\u00ad man suggests, his name would appear at the bottom, not Cutler's. One of the many discrepancies in the Cutler/Twining memo noted by the National Archives is that it does not bear a registration number as do other top-secret papers declassified and made public in the massive collection in which Moore and Shandera said they found the Cutler/Twining memo. Friedman's explanation is that the Cutler/Twining memo was \"planted\" by one of the USAF officers involved in reviewing and declassifying the many thousands of documents. The careless officer simply forgot to stamp a registration number on the \"planted\" document. But how would the officer know that Moore and Shandera had the MJ- 12 papers and sorely needed what Moore has called \"an official document 288 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER available through a public source that talked about MJ-12\" to \"authenticate\" the MJ-12 papers? And that Moore and Shandera would promptly visit the Archives and spot the one-page memo among the many thousands of papers in more than a hundred boxes of newly released files? At MUFON's 1982 conference, held in Toronto in early July, Moore presented a paper on new evidence to support the Roswell crashed-saucer story and said it would be included in his new book, The Roswell Evidence, to be published in the spring of 1983. But the book was never published, perhaps because public interest in UFOs had dropped to an all-time low. In early January 1987, a UFO-sighting report by a Japan Air Lines 747 pilot attracted considerable media attention (SI, Summer 1987, p. 322). Soon afterward, Whitley Strieber's book Communion, describing his alleged abduc\u00ad tion by UFOnauts, quickly climbed to the best-seller list (SI, Fall 1987, p. 90). By the spring of 1987, publishers were interested in books on the subject\u2014 at least those that were pro-UFO. The April 30, 1987, issue of a UFO newsletter that Moore publishes contained the first three pages of the MJ-12 document, which had been heavily censored by Moore himself. In the newsletter, Moore said the \"information is being shared with the UFO community, and through them, ultimately, with the public at large, in anticipation that the resulting con\u00ad troversy will prove useful in further verifying the authenticity of its contents.\" He implied that the material had been supplied by his \"well-placed contacts within the American intelligence community.\" Several weeks later, the London Observer broke the story on the MJ-12 papers, which had been supplied to it by British UFOlogist Timothy Good, author of a new book entitled Above Top Secret: The Worldwide UFO Coverup, scheduled for publication in July. Good was quoted as saying he had obtained the MJ-12 papers \"two months ago from a reliable American source who has close connections with the intelligence community.\" Shortly thereafter, Moore, Friedman, and Shandera made public the full and un- censored version of the MJ-12 papers, including the Cutler/ Twining memo. (Moore has never replied to my several letters asking if he was Good's \"American source.\") Moore, Friedman, and Shandera have publicly said they are \"90-95 per\u00ad cent\" confident of the authenticity of the MJ-12 papers, but they have offered no reason for their not being 100 percent confident. If they discovered any disturbing discrepancies in their more than two years of investigation, they have never revealed them publicly. Nor have they acknowledged the validity of any of the many anomalies turned up by others, even by members of the UFO movement. Instead, Moore chooses to ignore critics and speak of additional evidence to be released at some future date, while Friedman sharply attacks the critics. One possible explanation is an understandable reluctance to admit they are victims of a hoax because of their superficial investigation. The alternative explanation is too obvious to require statement here. Neither alternative is likely to enhance their reputations in the UFO movement. Spring 1988 289 Doomsday: The May 2000 Prediction Some astronomical dos and don'ts in predicting the (next) doomsday Jean Meeus THERE HAVE always been people who\u2014without substantial grounds \u2014predict planetary catastrophes or even the \"end of the world.\" We can understand that in antiquity people were terrified when a solar eclipse took place, or when a bright comet appeared in the sky. Nowadays we laugh at such reactions, but in those remote times no one knew what was actually happening. In the twentieth century, however, this brand of doomsaying cannot be justified. When, in May 1910, Earth was about to pass through the \"poi\u00ad sonous\" tail of Halley's comet, some people panicked. When, on June 14, 1968, the minor planet Icarus passed within only four million kilometers of Earth, there were predictions of a possible collision, although astronomers insisted that the orbits of Earth and Icarus did not cross and that consequently a collision was out of the question. In 1974, John Gribbin and Stephen Plagemann published their book The Jupiter Effect, which stated that in 1982 \"all the planets will be aligned on the same side of the Sun\" (p. 101). As a result of a complicated chain of related events, the authors predicted for 1982 a very high sunspot maximum and great earthquakes affecting principally the Los Angeles region. Alas, no planetary alignment took place, the smallest heliocentric sector containing all nine planets being 95 degrees, on March 10, 1982 (Meeus 1979); the sunspot maximum occurred in November 1979; and Los Angeles survived these events. Today, some cranks have invented something new. They now predict a catastrophe for the year 2000, because in May of that year the planets Jupiter and Saturn will be simultaneously behind the Sun as seen from Earth. Indeed, this prediction is correct, astronomically speaking: In A.D. 2000 the two planets will be (almost) simultaneously in conjunction with the Sun\u2014namely, Jupiter on May 8 and Saturn on May 10. (All dates in this article are based Jean Meeus is a Belgian amateur astronomer and a specialist in mathematical astronomy. In 1986 the Astronomical Society of the Pacific presented him the Ama\u00ad teur Achievement Award for his contributions in the field of astronomy. His address: Heuvestraat 31, B-3071 Erps-Kwerps, Belgium. 290 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER on Universal Time, the civil time of Greenwich). The date for the \"catastro\u00ad phe\" is sometimes given as May 5, which is rather strange, since it's obvious that May 9 is a much better date. In fact, the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn conjunction of May 2000 will have no effect whatsoever on the Sun or on Earth. Those who hold an opposite view should consider that groupings like that of May 2000, though relatively rare, did happen several times in recent centuries. In May 2000, the Sun-Jupiter and the Sun-Saturn conjunctions will occur at an interval of 64 hours\u2014more than two and a half days. But since the year 1600 there have been four occurrences where the interval was less than two days, resulting in a closer \"matching\" than the 2000 grouping. Those four cases are shown in Table 1. Nevertheless, nothing unusual happened during those epochs. This suffices to refute the 2000 prediction. Year 1623 1742 1881 1921 TABLE l Date of Conjunction with Sun Jupiter Saturn Aug. 3 Aug. 17 Apr. 22 Sept. 22 Aug. 1 Aug. 18 Apr. 22 Sept. 21 Time Difference in Hours 46 35 13 33 Apparently some people did not learn from the Gribbin-Plagemann affair, and they take this new type of astrology seriously. Why did they not predict catastrophes for April 4, 1989, when Mercury and Venus will be in superior conjunction with the Sun with a time difference of only ten hours? If you object that Mercury and Venus are small planets, while Jupiter and Saturn are giants, let me reply with Table 2 (Meeus 1975). The tidal effect of one celestial body upon another body is inversely TABLE 2 Relative Tidal Effects of the Planets on the Sun, The Effect of Earth Being Taken as Unity Mercury (P) Mercury (A) Venus Earth Mars (P) Mars (A) Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune 1.89 0.54 2.15 1 0.041 0.023 2.26 0.11 0.002 0.0006 The values given here are for the mean distance to the Sun. However, due to the large eccentricity of their orbits, the values for Mercury and Mars are given for both perihelion (P) and aphelion (A). Spring 1988 291 proportional to the cube of the separating distance. For this reason, the tidal effect of Venus on the Sun is almost as large as the tidal effect of the giant, but remote, Jupiter. And Mercury's effect is always larger than that of Saturn. If, however, you think of tidal effects on Earth, why did nothing happen on April 3, 1985, when Mercury and Venus passed almost simultaneously at inferior conjunction, between the Sun and Earth, with a time difference of only eight hours? It should be pointed out, once and for all, that even an exact alignment of all planets cannot have the slightest effect on the Sun or on Earth. Calculation shows that the height of the tidal \"bulge\" on the Sun, due to the planets, would be less than two millimeters. And for Earth, consider the fact that the tidal action of the Moon far surpasses that of all planets combined, even when the planets are simultaneously at their closest distance to Earth. And now let me make a prediction. When the year 2000 passes without having brought a catastrophe, doomsayers will provide us still another date for the end of the world. Well, let me propose August 27, 2003, when Mars will come closer to Earth than at any time in the past several thousand years, namely, to 55.76 million kilometers (Goffin and Meeus 1978)\u2014although this is not much closer than the preceding record (55.78 million kilometers, on August 22, 1924). Or doomsday could take place on May 28-29, 2048, when Venus and Jupiter, the two brightest planets in the sky, will be in superior conjunction with the Sun with a time difference of less than 12 hours\u2014or on any date you like.

(See SI, Fall 1987.) A few physicians who consider themselves homeopaths use \"electrodiag- nostic\" machines to help select the remedies they prescribe. The main pro\u00ad ponent of this method in the United States is F. Fuller Royal, M.D., owner and medical director of the Nevada Clinic in Las Vegas. Dr. Royal is a member of Nevada's homeopathic licensing board and was its president from 1983 to 1985. Nevada Clinic publications state that electrodiagnosis is one of the most effective aids for diagnosing illness and that \"there are no incurable diseases, only ignorant physicians.\" The initial clinic visit\u2014which spans a two-day period\u2014commonly costs $700 to $800, including $165 for allergy testing and $100 for homeopathic remedies. The program also includes lectures on nutri\u00ad tion and allergies. The clinic is located in a small shopping center near the outskirts of Las Vegas. It has 10,000 feet of floor space with more than 40 rooms. The spacious waiting room is tastefully decorated and seats 18 people. Most staff members wear white uniforms with royal blue jackets. There are four physi\u00ad cians, each of whom sees about 70 patients during a 41/2-day work week. Patients are typically asked to return three times during the six months after their first visit and annually thereafter. Most learn of the clinic by word-of- mouth or from ads in homeopathic or health-food publications. After making an appointment, they are sent medical-history forms to complete. Dr. Barrett, who practices psychiatry in Allentown, Pennsylvania, edits Nutrition Forum Newsletter and is coauthor/editor of 21 books on health topics. He is also cochairman of CSICOP's Paranormal Health Claims Subcommittee. A reprint of this article plus Dr. Barrett's \"Homeopathy: Is It Medicine?\" (SI, Fall, 1987) is available for $3 from the Lehigh Valley Committee Against Health Fraud (LVCAHF), Inc., P.O. Box 1747, Allentown, PA 18105. Spring 1988 293 Upon arrival at the clinic, patients are given a name-tag and asked to sign an insurance form and a consent form acknowledging that the clinic specializes in electrodiagnosis, uses homeopathic methods, has made no guarantees, and will not function as their primary physician for routine examinations or other necessary treatment. After signing the forms, patients receive the 71-page Patient's Handbook and are shown a 20-minute videotape, both of which introduce the staff and explain the clinic's methods. Then they are escorted to the various rooms where examinations and educational programs are carried out. They are weighed, their blood pressure is taken by a nurse, and specimens of urine and blood are taken for laboratory analysis. Since overnight fasting is required for some of the blood-chemistry tests, a snack of juice, nuts, and rice cakes is provided after the blood is drawn. (Some clinic \"veterans\" bring their own snacks.) All patients at the Nevada Clinic are diagnosed with a computerized galvanometer called the INTERRO. This is said to measure changes in the skin's electrical resistance, which indicate whether the body's organ systems have proper \"electromagnetic energy balance.\" To use the device, the doctor probes \"acupuncture points\" on the patient's hands and feet and interprets numbers on the computer's screen. (The less the electrical resistance, the higher the score.) One wire from the computer goes to a brass cylinder covered by moist gauze, which the patient holds in one hand. A second wire is connected to a probe that the doctor touches to the patient's other hand or foot. When he does so, it completes a low-voltage circuit and causes a band to rise from 20 to up to 100 on a scale on the computer screen. Readings above 60 are said to represent \"inflammation,\" readings of 48 to 60 are normal, and readings below 48 represent \"degenera\u00ad tion,\" which may signifiy cancer or atherosclerosis. The device makes a whin\u00ad ing noise resembling that of an electrical motor; the higher the number, the louder the noise. The INTERRO is programmed so that charts and tables can be placed on the screen to help the doctor select from approximately 1,700 homeopathic remedies. By selecting certain remedies and retesting with the probe, the doctor determines which remedies will balance the disturbed energy flow in the patient's body. (According to the Patient's Handbook, \"the magnetic blueprint of the homeopathic remedy flows through the body via the electrical current and resonates in harmony with the body, returning an abnormal reading to normal.\") One or more remedies may be placed in a tray attached to the computer to receive an energy transfer. The INTERRO and another device are used to diagnose allergies. During the latter procedure, vials of common allergy-causing substances are placed in the tray so they become part of the circuit. Mercury dental fillings are probed with another electrodiagnostic device said to measure negative electrical potentials, which, if too great, indicate that toxic amounts of mercury or other metals may spread to surrounding tissues and cause eventual damage to nearby nerves. 294 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Some patients are tested by the clinic nutritionist with a device in which vitamins, minerals, and enzymes are placed in a tray connected to a meter that supposedly indicates whether the patient needs them. Last October, at Dr. Royal's invitation, I underwent all of the electrodiag- nostic tests except for vitamin testing. After testing me on the INTERRO, he said I had a number of electromagnetic blockages and had \"temporomandi\u00ad bular joint stress, probable subclinical allergies, and possible mild early pre\u00ad clinical arthritis.\" After determining what he thought was the most appropriate remedy, he placed a vial of vitamin Bl2 in the tray and \"transferred an electromagnetic blueprint\" to it. He explained that it was desirable to overcome \"energy blocks\" caused by the scars in my skin. Since the energy travels mainly through acupuncture meridians on the surface of the skin, he wanted to remove the blockage by injecting the specially prepared B12 into the points of blockage: my appendectomy scar, the areas inside my throat from which my tonsils had been removed, the skin near my jaw joints, and my vaccination scar. After doing this, he retested and said that most of the blocks were gone but that my jaw showed considerable tension and should be manipulated. After doing that, he prescribed five homeopathic remedies for home use and advised me to have my dentist replace one of my mercury amalgam fillings with another material. During the testing, I noticed that the harder the probe was pressed to my finger or toe, the higher the reading on the INTERRO screen. Royal readily acknowledged this, but said, \"That's why it takes a lot of training to use the equipment properly.\" The manufacturer's literature states that if the INTERRO is used for medical diagnosis in the United States, it must bear the label \"FOR INVESTIGATION USE ONLY. The performance characteristics of this product have not been established\" and that diagnosis must be confirmed with an accepted medical procedure. But Royal told me that no such label was needed. A sign in the clinic pharmacy warns that homeopathic remedies should be kept away from electrical outlets and appliances and should not be X-rayed at airport entries. The reason for this is that \"remedies possess electromagnetic fields [that] become distorted and unpredictable when strongly affected by other magnetic fields.\" The nutrition lecture was conducted by a woman who said she had taken correspondence courses through Donsbach University (an unaccredited school) and the American Nutrition Consultants Association (a group anyone can join for $25). Her main advice was to eat less meat and more fresh fruits, vegetables, and other unprocessed foods. She recommended installation of a home water-purifier. She also said that aluminum pots can cause Alzheimer's disease, that milk (other than goat's milk) is not good for adults, that micro\u00ad wave cooking \"zaps the life force\" and changes the molecular structure of foods, and that sunshine beneficially stimulates the pituitary gland. Royal calls his approach \"bioenergetic medicine\" and says it is the wave of the future. He was introduced to it by Floyd Weston, a former insurance Spring 1988 295 executive who had investigated its use in Germany while conducting a world\u00ad wide search for \"the answer to good health.\" When Weston approached him, Royal was practicing medicine in Oregon and felt that the medical climate would be hostile toward electrodiagnosis. Royal told me that Weston investigated the situation in Nevada and reported that some influential people were interested in having another type of tourist industry besides gambling and had promised him that Royal would not be bothered there by medical authorities. In 1979, before Royal could relocate, Oregon's board of medical examiners became concerned about his use of electrodiagnosis and ordered him to take written and oral competency examinations. He passed the written examination and, since he had been planning to move anyway, it was agreed that the oral exam would be dropped and his Oregon license classified as inactive. The governor of Nevada subsequently appointed Royal to a homeopathic advisory board, and a homeopathic licensing law was passed that included \"noninvasive electrodiagnosis\" as part of the definition of homeopathy. So this practice is now legal in Nevada. The Nevada Clinic of Preventive Medicine opened in 1980, but in 1983 its name was shortened because insurance companies would not honor claims from a \"preventive medicine\" clinic. (\"With the name change,\" the clinic newsletter notes, \"more patients' insurance claims are being paid.\") Royal originally directed the clinic's medical aspects and Weston directed its business aspects; but in 1983 they parted company, and in 1984 Royal became sole owner and operator. Royal struck me as an extremely sincere person who believes in what he is doing and wants very much to help those who consult him. His clinic setup radiates caring and concern. The atmosphere is unhurried, and the staff is friendly, efficient, and energetic. Everything is explained in detail, an aspect of treatment missing.from many medical practices. From a marketing stand\u00ad point, the clinic setup is outstanding. So far 16,000 patients have been seen at the Nevada Clinic. Royal said he plans to double the clinic's size, to add a mini-kitchen and physical therapy department, and to computerize all patient records so that statistical reports will be easy to compile. Do Royal's methods actually help people? It would be easy to suggest that, since electrodiagnosis and homeopathy are outside the realm of accepted medical practice, such treatment is worthless. But Royal says that most of his patients suffer from headaches and/ or allergies. These conditions often have an emotional component that can be influenced by a positive doctor-patient interaction\u2014which most patients who trust the Nevada Clinic are likely to experience. Does the clinic lure people away from effective treatment? My single visit could not determine this, but several patients told me they had not been helped by their previous doctors. Royal said he does not accept cancer patients because \"if they get better, physicians will say it was a spontaneous remission or that the patient did not have cancer at all; and if they die, I'll get blamed. 296 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER It's a no-win situation.\" Royal said he does not want to treat severe neurological disorders like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\"Lou Gehrig's disease\") or the late stages of multiple sclerosis. Nor does he want to treat illnesses severe enough to require hospital care or surgery. Regarding medications prescribed by other doctors, he said, \"All medications are to be continued until improvement is noted by the referring doctor and/or the patient. We advise patients to follow the advice of their personal physician and to give us progress reports at specific times.\" It would be fascinating to conduct a well-designed study to measure what Royal is actually accomplishing. He seems open and self-confident enough to cooperate with such a study if an appropriate person or agency were interested in carrying it out. the Skeptical A great gift for relatives and friends and for your local library.

Box 229 Buffalo, New York 14215-0229 716-834-3222 Spring 1988 297 Morphic Resonance in Silicon Chips An experimental test of the hypothesis of formative causation Francisco J. Varela and Juan C. Letelier RUPERT SHELDRAKE puts forth in A New Science of Life (Los Angeles: J. P. Tarcher, 1981) the hypothesis of formative causation, according to which \"morphogenetic fields play a causal role in the development and maintenance of the forms of systems at all levels of com\u00ad plexity\" (p. 71). The term morphogenetic field is used here in the sense of the effect of a given configuration in the arising of similar forms in the future, an effect that Sheldrake refers to as \"morphic resonance\" (p. 95). This effect is supposed to be independent of matter-energy fields, and to be a cumulative one. The intention of the hypothesis of formative causation is to account for the establishment and dynamic of patterns across all natural phenomena. Sheldrake's hypothesis is not, a priori, implausible. In fact, it does not claim more or less than the notion of action at a distance, first proposed by Newton. That is, it attempts to be a causal description of a domain of observations, but where the detailed nature of the mechanism is left open. By the same token, Sheldrake himself has suggested that morphic resonance is amenable to experimental test. One of the tests proposed by him applies to the realm of atomic configurations in the formation of crystals. Thus, \"after (a crystal) has been crystallized for the first time, the form of the crystal will influence subsequent crystallizations by morphic resonance, and the more often it is crystallized, the stronger this influence becomes\" (p. 104). This suggested experimental test, however, is beset with a number of difficulties, as are other experimental tests proposed by Sheldrake in this book. The diffi\u00ad culties are basically: (1) the complexity in synthesizing a new pattern, and (2) the difficulty in repeating its generation many times so as to ascertain whether its arising does indeed become easier, i.e., takes a shorter time. We propose here an experimental test that apparently overcomes those difficulties. The basic idea is to follow Sheldrake's reasoning reproduced Francisco J. Varela is a professor in the Centre de Recherche Epistemologie et Autonomic Ecole Poly technique, Paris. Juan C. Letelier is in the Department of Biology, City College CUNY, New York, N. Y. Address all correspondence to the lead author at: CREA, Ecole Polytechnique, 1, rue Descartes, 75005 Paris, France. 298 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER above, but to apply it for atomic configurations in silicon molecules, which can be easily manipulated in digital microcircuits. In fact, when a given bit configuration is induced in a microchip, it amounts to changes in the elec\u00ad tronic configuration of silicon molecules, which are physically very close to the kinds of events that occur in molecular changes leading to, say, crystalliza\u00ad tion or molecular transformations. In both cases, atomic orbitals are altered and new states are acquired in an atomic lattice composed of a large number of atoms. Thus creating a new configuration in a silicon chip amounts to the synthesis of a new \"crystal,\" with the added advantage of the ease with which it can be so produced and reproduced many times in a short time. Specifically, we have worked with a NorthStar Horizon II microcomputer, which uses an Intel Z80 CPU and a full set of registers. The set of instructions (available upon request) starts by clearing all the memory and flags of the computer to a null state and proceeds to grow an atomic pattern only in the CPU alternate registers, in the form of an alternation of high and low elec\u00ad tronic configurations. This \"silicon crystal\" is either completely novel or very rare, for no computer of this kind would have been set to this unusual configuration before. The instructions include a flag that indicates when the crystal begins to grow, and when it is complete in its growth (for a total of seven registers of eight bits each), by means of a flag in one of the address lines of the S-100 bus, which served here as interface. The experimental test then consists of measuring the time this silicon structure takes to form, after many repetitions. The total time it takes to grow is about 40 microseconds, and the unit change in the machine operations is about 1 microsecond. If Sheldrake's hypothesis were valid, one would expect to see some effect, on the order of a microsecond, on the time it takes for this configuration to form after a suitable number of repetitions or \"re- crystallizations.\" To measure this possible small difference, we have used a model SM-2420 Heath frequency counter, with a resolution of 0.25 nano\u00ad seconds (billionths of a second) at this frequency. Thus, if we take a very conservative expected change of 0.1 percent every 1 million repetitions, we expect a difference of 6Hz (hertz, the international unit of frequency, equal to one cycle per second) after a million repetitions, a range of change that is 100 times larger than the resolution of the frequency counter (for this range of frequency). Figure 1 illustrates the result of this experiment, where the frequency plotted corresponds to the time it takes for the silicon configuration to arise. To obtain this degree of precision we were forced to measure the average speed of morphogenesis every 10 seconds. The growth of this configuration was repeated several million times. As the figure shows, the measured time stays exactly the same even after 100 million repetitions, with a dispersion of only 0.05 Hz (or 0.125 nanoseconds). In contrast, the prediction from the hypothesis of formative causation is that the time needed to grow this silicon pattern should have decreased by morphic resonance in the range shown by the shaded area in Figure 1, if we take the conservative estimate of only 0.1 percent change after a million repetitions. This represents a speed of change Spring 1988 299 frequency [KHz] 24,828 x \" i \u00bb.. . 24,029.85! 0.05 of ~ 0,1%/million 10' Repetitions The shaded area corresponds to the expected change in frequency predicted by the hypothesis of formative causation, if a decrease of only 0.1 percent every million repetitions is assumed. Accuracy of the frequency measurement is 0.05 Hz; frequency measurements taken as averages over 10-second periods. FIGURE 1. Frequency of the Growth of Silicon Pattern After Successive Repetitions 100 times less than that suggested by Sheldrake's interpretation of other experimental data. (Cf. the interpretation of McDougall's experiments, Shel\u00ad drake, pp. 187 ff.) We conclude that this experimental test falsifies Sheldrake's hypothesis, even in its weak form assumed here. It is certainly possible to object that the hypothesis does not apply for the kinds of silicon structures studied by us. However, this would entail a substantial modification of the hypothesis as stated now to establish criteria for the kinds of phenomena that do fall within its range of applicability. Thus, either the hypothesis of formative causation is abandoned or else extensive ad-hoc revisions in it are called for in order to account for the data just presented. 300 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Abigail's Anomalous Apparition Investigating a report of the recurring apparition of a beautiful young woman Mark W. Durm THE NARRATIVE displayed on the following page describes the events surrounding one of the more famous ghosts in northern Ala\u00ad bama. Notice specifically that it says: \"Historical references to famous persons who appeared there over the years have given rise to several legends, including that of a beautiful young actress who performed the opera La Traviata at the dedication of the auditorium in 1914.\" Apparently Abigail Burns's existence and dedication were not to be questioned, only the legend surrounding her. This narrative was included in an announcement by the Athens State College Parapsychology Foundation, Athens, Alabama, publicizing a special performance of selections from Verdi's La Traviata by the Huntsville Opera Theatre. The event was to be held in memory of Abigail on May 12, 1987, in McCandless Auditorium on the campus of Athens State College, where Ms. Burns supposedly had reappeared as an apparition over the years. Before the Opera On April 23 the operatic memorial began to receive wide publicity when the Decatur Daily, a newspaper from a neighboring city, gave front-page attention to the upcoming event. On May 4, WAFF-TV in Huntsville, Alabama, pre\u00ad viewed the opera on the late evening news. As the time drew near, it seemed the media were treating Abigail's existence as fact and that the only question remaining was whether she would make a return appearance. During that same spring quarter, I had initiated a Special Topics Class in psychology entitled \"Skeptical Thinking.\" As the publicity mounted for Abigail's memorial, my class requested that as a special project they investigate the history of Abigail to verify the facts. The class was small (seven in number), but energetic and tenacious. Once we began our research, my students and I soon found that there was Mark W. Durm is associate professor of psychology, Division of Behavioral Sciences, Athens State College, Athens, Alabama 35611. Spring 1988 301 Abigail Lylia Burns 1892-1914 ONE OF THE more widely known paranormal occurrences in Northern Alabama is the recurring apparition of a beautiful young woman in McCandless Hall on the campus of Athens State College. The splendid Greek Revival structure houses the college's art, music, and drama departments as well as a magnificent auditorium. Historical references to famous persons who appeared there over the years have given rise to several legends, including that of a beautiful young actress who performed the opera La Traviata at the dedication of the auditorium in 1914. She so enthralled the warm audience, the legend goes, that even after many curtain calls, it remained reluctant to let her go. Finally, the young actress, dressed in a white gown and clutching a bouquet of red roses, made a curtain call and in tears promised to return, even if, she vowed, \"it is the last thing that I do.\" With that pledge, she departed in the blustery night by carriage for her next engagement in Huntsville, Alabama. Unfortunately, that ill-omened journey was to be cut short. Near midnight, the troupe, then several miles outside the city, was caught in a severe thunder\u00ad storm. The horse-drawn carriage vibrated against the force of the wind and torrential rain. Upon reaching a bridge, the already frightened horses, startled by a sudden clap of thunder, lunged forward, disengaging the carriage, which then plunged over the side of the bridge onto the bedrock below. The actress, mortally injured, was pulled from the wreckage. Still wearing the white gown and clutching the bouquet of red roses, she was heard to say, \"I have a promise to keep; I must return.\" Soon after her death, a tree was planted in her honor a few feet from the side entrance of McCandless Auditorium. The tree, a giant beech, still stands in mute testimony of the town's endless affection for an actress they loved and embraced as their own. Deep into the winter following her death, a ghostly image of a young woman, her golden hair glistening in the moonlight, was sighted at a third floor window of McCandless Hall. She wore a white gown and at her breast she clutched a bouquet of red roses. Through the years, the sightings con\u00ad tinued\u2014a beautiful but pensive young woman bathed in the light, always clutching a bouquet of red roses, faithfully keeping her vigil. [From an an\u00ad nouncement by the Athens State College Parapsychology Foundation.] absolutely no documentation of Abigail's visit and/or her performance at the college in 1914. After checking the historical records at the college, the county archives were surveyed as well as all of the 1914 issues (hundreds of pages) of the Alabama Courier, founded in 1880, and the Alabama Limestone Demo\u00ad crat, founded in 1891. These were the only two newspapers in existence in Limestone County at that time. Although both papers were attentive to reporting even the most trivial matters related to Athens College, the an\u00ad nouncement of Abigail Lylia Burns's concert was nowhere to be found. The October 21, 1914, issue of the Alabama Courier printed a large front\u00ad page article about the new music hall. (It was not named McCandless Audi- 302 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER torium until 1926.) This article explicitly stated who was to perform at the Music Hall for that year. It announced that there would be six events, and listed them as follows: 1. Enrico Aresoni, opera star 2. Zoelluer String Quartet of Brussels 3. Miss Adele Rosenthal, pianist 4. Reverend Thomas Mangum, traveler and speaker, giving an illustrated lecture on Africa 5. A college glee club concert 6. A dramatic reading. The same issue carried this item: Enrico Aresoni, the well-known dramatic tenor, will appear in a concert at the new Athens College music hall next Friday night. This announcement is im\u00ad portant for two reasons. It will be the first entertainment given in the new music hall and it is the first of a series of six programmes which will make up a splendid lyceum course offered by the college to the people of Athens. Mr. Aresoni is one of the world's foremost artists and his appearance here is a musical opportunity of great interest to all. Again, it must be emphasized that Ms. Burns's concert was not mentioned anywhere. One would believe that such occurrences as the events that sur\u00ad rounded her death would certainly have been reported. Furthermore, Mrs. Eulalia Wellden, keeper of the county archives, had closely studied all papers from the past years. When asked if she had ever heard or read of Abigail, she replied: \"I have no recollection of such an event and I have always been cognizant of college matters. There is no documentation at all of her ever being here.\" To investigate the matter more thoroughly, the Skeptical Thinking class wrote to the Bureau of Vital Statistics in Montgomery, Alabama, requesting a copy of the death certificate of Ms. Burns. \"A Certificate of Failure to Find Record\" was received May 26, 1987. It was from Forest E. Ludden, State Registrar, and read: \"This certificate verifies that a diligent search of the records in my custody has been made covering the period 1908 to 1922. No record was found to exist of the death of Abigail Lylia Burns during 1908- 1922 in Limestone/Madison County, Alabama.\" In addition, a local forester was asked to date the beech tree (\"Soon after her death, a [beech] tree was planted in her honor a few feet from the side entrance of McCandless Audi\u00ad torium\"). After discovering the only accurate way to do this would be to bore a hole into the tree, the class decided against this endeavor. Further, the Huntsville newspapers of that era were reviewed (\"she departed in the blustery night by carriage for her next engagement in Huntsville, Alabama\") to see if any announcement of her upcoming performance in that city was mentioned. No such announcement was found. Finally, Margaret Jones, a 1935 graduate of Athens College and a well-informed, energetic alumna, was interviewed to Spring 1988 303 ask her recollections of the Abigail legend. She had never heard of Abigail or the reappearing apparition. After completing our research, the class members and I decided there was no substantial evidence or documentation of any kind verifying Ms. Burns visit and/or performance at Athens College in 1914. Therefore, it was con\u00ad cluded that she never existed. Based on the findings of our exhaustive research as well as the Huntsville TV-station preview of the opera on the late news on May 4, I decided to present our data to the public. As class instructor, I wrote a memo on May 5 to the faculty and staff of the college outlining our findings. On the same day, I requested and was granted an interview with Huntsville's WAFF-TV. The rebuttal to the ghost story was aired on the news that evening; but none of the evidence disproving Abigail's existence was shown. On May 12 (the day of the opera) our research received media exposure in the Decatur Daily. The headline read: \"Skeptics: Opera singer, ghost never existed.\" The paper gave excellent coverage of our research and of its in- depth nature. However, they also reported the research techniques of the parapsychology group. Many of the details of Miss Burns surfaced through table-tilting, hypnotism and other techniques used by .. . [the] parapsychology classes. In table-tilting, about six people sit around a table with their fingers lightly touching the table top. ... A spirit can communicate with this world by causing the table to tilt on two legs in response to questions people ask. Through table- tilting . . . [the] class learned that a heartbroken lover of Miss Burns would frequent their former meeting place on the third floor of McCandless Hall after her death because he felt close to her there. After reading the article in the Decatur Daily, a reporter from a local radio station, WZYP (the station with probably the largest audience in the area), called to discuss our findings. Beginning at approximately 1:00 P.M. on that same day, this reporter related our skeptical results during the news presentation every hour until the opera commenced that evening. During the Opera Apparently none of the approximately 300 people in the audience saw Abi\u00ad gail's apparition except for one. That one, Ed Langla, a \"past-life hypno\u00ad therapist\" from New Orleans who had been practicing in Athens during the past year, said he saw Abigail in the light and that she had waved good-bye. Langla said the purpose of the opera performance was to let Abigail transcend to the place she \"needed to go.\"1 Believers who did not see her turned to other sense modalities. Naoko Worrell, who volunteered to act as a \"transmedium,\" said Abigail became ecstatic during certain points of the opera. Worrell stated during intermission, \"Every time the soprano sings she sings along and my body starts vibrating. She's very heavy.\"2 Helen Matsos, a soprano who sang an aria from La 304 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Traviata, said she felt Abigail's presence while on stage. \"I could feel electricity going through my arms, like they were going to sleep or something. It was very strange,\" she said.3 Other opera members, however, noticed nothing unusual. One singer, Jan Nichols, stated: \"We were watching backstage and there was nothing. We felt some rumbling in the floor, but that was from the air conditioner.\" Some members of the audience said they smelled some roses (apparently disregarding the fact that a dozen roses were actually present in the small auditorium).4 One wonders if those who \"witnessed\" Abigail's presence were not cog\u00ad nizant of our findings or simply disdained them. After the Opera The day following the opera, WZYP-Radio reported that Abigail had not appeared. The announcement supported the skeptical viewpoint, stating that skeptics had predicted she would not appear and that the ghost story was just that\u2014a ghost story. On May 14 the Birmingham News ran an article entitled \"The Phantom of the (Athens) Opera Fails to Make Her Appearance\": . . . The character appears to have been \"created\" by the parapsychology group during its \"table-tilting\" seances in McCandless Auditorium and apparently never appeared at the school as a student or performer. I don't know where the story came from because it can't be proven and those who were students here long ago never seem to have heard this legend, Durm said. Finale Of great interest to my Skeptical Thinking class was Abigail's \"persistence.\" Even though she had been thoroughly disproved, certain members of the Parapsychology Foundation still discussed Abigail's memorial and her rosy- scented return on May 12. Abigail's persistence was a perfect example of cognitive bias. Selective perception and selective exposure had caused reason to continue to sleep, and as the adage warns, \"The sleep of reason brings forth monsters.\" In this case, the monster was a golden-haired, white-cloaked singer. But in seven seeking students, reason had not slept.5 Notes 1. Carl Cronan, \"Ghostly 'Abigail' said to show at Opera, but not for viewers,\" Decatur Daily, May 13, 1987, A16. 2. Ibid. 3. Ibid. 4.

Spring 1988 305 The Riddle of the Colorado Ghost Lights A ghostly mystery yields to reflection Kyle J. Bunch and Michael K. White AT THE FOOT of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, in the Wet Mountain valley of Colorado, lies a small mining town of about 130 people. Once the third-largest city in Colorado, Silver Cliff held in its heyday more than 10,000 people. Now the ghost lights of the old cemetery are the main attraction to the area, and the souls of the old miners are said to dance among the gravestones. The cemetery is not difficult to find, sitting about a mile down a dirt road, away from town. Westcliffe sits to the north; at night, the city lights project brightly into space, in stark contrast to the total blackness engulfing the cemetery to the south. Local residents have long taken for granted that the lights have chosen to appear here, sometimes as dancing blue spheres, or as white points that recede when approached, but always as something inherently inexplicable. Those who scoff at such things as ghosts will give the usual explanation that the city lights reflect off the gravestones. Even these people seem to harbor doubts about the origin of the phenomenon, that maybe there is something beyond just the superficial explanation. To further the doubt, National Geographic mentioned the ghost lights in its August 1969 issue, in which a reporter investigated the cemetery on his trek through Colorado, where indeed he saw something he could not explain. This brief note on the cemetery would be forgotten were it not for the crudely lettered sign posted at the entrance: Silver Cliff Cemetery Founded in 1878 Famous for Ghost Lights Reported in National Geographic. It is said that once all the lights of the town were turned off to disprove the theory of ghosts, but the ghost lights only appeared with more brilliance. Kyle Bunch is an electrical engineer working toward his Ph.D. at the University of Utah. Michael White is a reporter in Greeley, Colorado. Both are authors of published short stories and poetry. 306 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER In order to cut through all of the stories and explanations, we decided to spend three evenings at the cemetery in hopes of viewing the phenomenon. Having both grown up in nearby Pueblo, Colorado, we have had occasion to fall prey to the aura of mystery surrounding the ghost lights. As children, the temptation to see actual ghosts in an old cemetery was almost too good to be true; unfortunately, through the eyes of frightened twelve-year-olds, any unusual phenomena are bound to be explained as ghosts. Indeed, given the setting and the anticipation, it is not surprising that even the adults who accompanied us began seeing inexplicable phenomena. So we found ourselves sitting in a blackened cemetery on a cool September evening. The lights began to appear, faintly at first, but growing stronger as the sun dipped completely behind the mountains. Most of the lights were well-defined points that could be traced directly to the face of any particular headstone by using a flashlight. When approached, however, the lights appeared to recede or even disappeared altogether. They gave the impression of having some intelligence behind them as they wobbled and danced. Fortunately, in order to explain the ghostly nature of the lights, one needs to know little of the paranormal. With a smattering of high-school physics, human psychology, and common sense, every effect we observed can be easily explained. In fact, the phenomenon can be summed up in one word: reflections. So let us carefully examine the mechanisms behind the ghost lights. The headstone material is quite consistently either white or black marble that has been cut to a flat face and a curved top surface. The faces of the stones are polished to smoothness. It may not be immediately apparent, but even black marble will serve as a crude mirror if its surface is made smooth enough. Furthermore, light will be almost totally reflected if it hits the marble at an oblique-enough angle. For instance, if we were to shine a light directly perpendicular onto a slab of black marble, most of the light would be absorbed. If we were to tilt the flashlight to either side, we would find an Spring 1988 307 angle at which light would be reflected. This effect is easily observed with water. Even a muddied lake will reflect the sky if the light hits it at a glancing angle. (This angle is called the \"critical angle\" in physics.) In fact, there will be a range of angles at which the reflection is almost perfect. Next, if we examine the shape of the headstones we discover some peculiar effects. The face of a typical headstone is flat, and reflection off its surface is easiest to understand. Images reflected at oblique angles become stretched; points of light can easily become blobs or streaks. Furthermore, if a headstone is smooth, but not perfectly flat, a reflection off its surface easily turns into an image that dances when the observer moves his body. Reflections off the headstone tops behave differently from those off the headstone faces. Most people can recognize a reflection off a flat surface, and so those who see the lights give lip service to this effect. When faced with the inconsistent behavior of the lights, however, people conclude that another, inexplicable process is occurring. This \"second phenomenon\" can also be explained as a reflection, but off a curved surface. In a hall of mirrors, unusual effects can be obtained by warping a reflect\u00ad ing surface. A mirror curving in (concave) can sharpen a reflection to a point, while one curving out (convex) can take a source of light and distort it to be a formless blob. More important, light reflecting at an oblique angle off the headstone tops would appear to move differently from that reflecting off the faces. Because the headstones are so narrow, reflections could be seen only over a thin range of horizontal distance. Thus these reflections would not be easily seen, making the effect appear transient and mysterious. When we visited the cemetery, the city lights were like floodlights in the distance, unobscured by any lights in the immediate vicinity. We could easily position ourselves to obtain a reflection from the city lights. As mentioned previously, though, the ghostly phenomenon has appeared even when the city lights are turned off. Furthermore, some reports of seeing the lights date back to the late 1800s, indicating that a source other than the city lights exists. Here is where we must look to nature for souces of light. Turning from the city, we are faced with blackness all around, until we look above the horizon and see nature's own floodlights, the stars. On the nights we viewed the ghost lights, the moon was not out, and stars were shining with such brilliance that it is unbelievable previous investigations could have overlooked their effects. Those who have spent their lives in the city may question that the stars could be bright enough to produce an effect; but, in the mountains of Colorado, pollution is nonexistent and the high elevation means that there is less atmosphere to impede the travel of light. Conditions are frequently such that ghost lights are produced from any location in the cemetery, even without man-made sources of light. Whatever the source of light on a particular night, be it city lights, the stars, or the moon, two effects can be noticed. In the early evening, the ground is still cooling off from the sun's heat. The temperature fluctuates in the atmosphere, causing the sources to \"twinkle\" and making reflections appear to dance. Also, when the cemetery is at its darkest, all visual references 308 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER disappear. A point of light will appear to drift because of unconscious motions of the eye. This effect is frequently to blame when people report UFOs in the sky that make unusual movements. Finally, we should not overlook perhaps the main driving force behind the ghost lights of Silver Cliff\u2014the psychological one. Let's face it, we were in the middle of a dark cemetery in a town where reports of ghost lights are prevalent. We expected to see something, and we were not disappointed. It is easy to lose all objectivity when confronted by these mischievous orbs of light, even when as adults we should know better. For so many years the mystique of the Silver Cliff cemetery has far outweighed any objective attempt to examine possible causes. The place has an undeniable aura of mystery, but the only truly mysterious thing we observed was a bouquet of fresh flowers adorning the grave of a two-day-old infant who had died in 1927. Obviously, there is more than one mystery in this ancient graveyard. Subscription Service Are you curious about your subscription?

Book Reviews Easy Reading About Hard Mysteries Mystic Places. By the Editors of Time-Life Books. Mysteries of the Unknown Series. Time-Life Books, Alexandria, Va. 1987. 160 pp. $14.95. Charles J. Cazeau MYSTIC PLACES is the first book in Time-Life Books' widely advertised new Mysteries of the Unknown series (see SI News and Comment, Summer 1987). It contains five chapters: \"Atlantis,\" \"The Great World.\" Between the chapters are five pic\u00ad torial essays touching upon related subjects. The numerous and elegant illustrations alone make the book worthy of purchase. A scientific treatise it is not. There is little if any critical analy\u00ad sis. Nor was this the intent. The authors are saying, \"Look, this book is to entertain you with some interesting stories and pretty pic\u00ad tures. We don't half-believe this stuff ourselves but there's an out\u00ad side chance there may be something to it all.\" This attitude is buttressed by qualifiers like \"so-called,\" \"purported,\" and \"they claim.\" Even mainstream scientists are allowed their say, albeit briefly. Chapter 1, on Atlantis, provides a rich background with due credit to Plato, the originator of the legend. It was easy, the authors say, to believe in the former existence of the lost continent in a largely unexplored world, where such speculations took firm root and often persisted into more recent times. The life and ideas of Ignatius Donnelly, a leading Atlantis exponent of the last century, are detailed, but the shortcomings of his work are noted. The views of Madame Blavatsky and Edgar Charles J. Cazeau is a geologist and the coauthor (with Stuart D. Scott, Jr.) of Exploring the Unknown: Great Mysteries Reexamined (Plenum Press). Spring 1988 313 Cayce are also paraded across the stage. Just when the reader is convinced Atlantis existed, the authors throw in all the geologic evidence demonstrating that there never was such a continent. The last segment of the chapter entertains the possibility that the real Atlantis was after all Crete. But that is still above water. The Time-Life authors conclude, possibly with tongue in cheek, that perhaps \"a mystic Atlantis still rests in the deep, waiting to give up its age-old secrets.\" Chapter 2 deals briefly with the methods of construction of the Great Pyramid at Giza and its purported purpose. This is followed by an interesting chronicle of efforts to discover hidden meanings in the dimensions of the Great Pyramid, espe\u00ad cially those of nineteenth-century investigators John Taylor and Piazzi Smyth, who maintained that measurements of the pyramid showed the Eyptians far in advance of the times in mathematics, geometry, and astronomy. To a point, they believed that only divine inspiration could be the source of this knowledge. This account is balanced by the depiction of the work of Egyptologist Flinders Petrie, who found no scientific foundation for such measurements and their assumptions. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the pyramid-power fad\u2014the idea that the shape of the pyramid provides a mechanism to preserve organic material, sharpen razor blades, and induce feelings of well-being for those camped inside a pyramid tent. The focus of \"The Meaning of the Megaliths\" (Chapter 3) is Stonehenge. Again, a chronological approach is used, beginning with folklore and speculations of the Middle Ages about how and why Stonehenge was built, including the tale of the stones' flight from Ireland to Britain with the help of Merlin's wizardry. King James I commissioned architect Inigo Jones in 1620 to get to the bottom of the mystery. Jones concluded that the Romans built Stonehenge and that the Druids, who were not architects, had nothing to do with it. Along come William Stukeley and John Aubrey, names closely associated with Stonehenge investigations, who claim the Druids did indeed build it. Then we have Gerald Hawkins, who presents evidence that Stonehenge really functioned as a computerized astronomical observatory. This leads to a discussion of the ley lines and other archaeoastronomical evidence of Alexander Thorn. It is a readable and interesting chapter, flawed only by hearsay and anecdotal tales of UFO visitations and psychic vibrations at Stonehenge, without rebuttal. Chapter 4, \"Pictures on the Earth,\" is mostly about the Nazca Plains. The fact is brought out that there are a multitude of large pictorial representations elsewhere on the earth. Those familiar with the Nazca lines and animal portraits best seen from the sky will also be familiar with the work of Maria Reiche, which is highlighted in this chapter. So are the \"theories\" of the discredited Erich von Daniken. However, the opinions of scientists of von Daniken's ideas are reasonably presented. There is a fine summation on the construction of the hot-air balloon by the International Explorer's Society to see if the Nazcas could have made such a balloon and viewed the drawings from the air or supervised their rendering. The reader is left to sort out the motives for such drawings, and alternative possibilities are presented. The apex of the fantastic is reached in the final chapter, \"An Interior World.\" The thesis is examined that the earth is hollow. Small wonder, perhaps, because in recent years some Soviet \"scientists\" proposed that the moon is hollow. The chapter explores the myths that woolly mammoths may still wander inside the earth; that a race of degenerate people lurk below; that the northern lights are beams shining out from within; that Adolf Hitler sent out expeditions to find openings in the earth so he could see the movements of the British Fleet on the other side. Even the respected Edmond Halley of Halley's comet proposed a hollow-earth theory. Fortunately, the 314 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER writer of the chapter doesn't really believe there is a hollow earth. Unfortunately, the gullible will read it and think that there might be. In sum, an interesting book to read and a fine exercise in separating fiction from nonfiction. The skeptic will feel it gives too much credence to sensationalist beliefs. Perhaps. Yet this volume certainly distances itself from pure National Enquirer drivel. Lost in the Flying-Saucer Subculture In Advance of the Landing: Folk Concepts of Outer Space. By Douglas Curran. Abbeville Press, New York. 1985. 132 pp. Oversized paperback, $16.95. Michael R. Dennett ONLY A handful of the hundreds of books about flying saucers merit serious consideration. In Advance of the Landing: Folk Concepts of Outer Space, by Douglas Curran, is one of those few good books. Indeed it is an exciting photo- narrative that covers facets not normally explored. In the Foreword, Tom Wolfe writes of the author: \"[He] is not only a photographer but also a reporter, and an extremely gifted one.\" I agree. In Advance of the Landing is the product of eight years of exploration by Curran into the North American subculture of the flying saucer. The book is richly composed of more than 60 photographs and complementary text. Its message and significance are in no way depreciated by the photojournalism format. The author's odyssey across the United States and Canada brought him into contact with the exotic and often quixotic world of the flying-saucer worshiper. Curran met Charles Gaiffe at Giant Rock, California, in 1977. Gaiffe, then 78, had driven from his home in Ohio to seek help from UFO-contactee George Van Tassel. Gaiffe was hoping to gain information about a UFO propulsion system for \"Blue\u00ad bird,\" an incomplete flying saucer he was working on. \"Bluebird,\" pictured in the book, was a project of the ASDP (Advanced Scientific Development Project). Van Tassel, although in close contact with the space brothers, was unable to help Gaiffe. Gaiffe continues to work on a motor that will make \"Bluebird\" fly. South of San Bernardino, Curran met Carl Gendreau, another subject of his photographs. Carl, who lives in his 1962 Meteor and a tent, believes that an airliner will make contact with a giant UFO in the near future. For those who want to see a flying saucer now, there is Henry DiCienzo's Flying Saucer Drive-in, built in 1972 and located in Niagara Falls, Ontario. Curran reports that the drive-in was recently enlarged and \"now boasts 96 lights.\" A key element in the success of this book is the author's ability to identify and empathize with so many of his subjects. Curran spends a night atop Red Mountain, Michael R. Dennett is a member of CSICOP's UFO Subcommittee and a frequent contributor to the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER. Spring 1988 315 Orlando Toroni spends his nights on a hillside tracking spaceships hiding behind satellites. Near Orland, California. (Reprinted from In Advance of the Landing, with permission.) California, with Orlando Toroni. Toroni, an unemployed bulldozer operator, uses a pair of aircraft traffic lights to signal alien spaceships, which he claims hide behind Earth satellites. At a meeting of the Aetherius Society in Hollywood and at a New Age convention near Mt. Rainier, Washington, Curran met more UFO contactees and people who believe in them. The author was not always successful in winning the trust of followers of alien prophets. At O. T. Nodrog's Time Ark Base near Weslaco, Texas, not all believed that Curran was sincere. He did learn from members that UFOs were five-dimensional craft and that training was available at the base on a 13,000-mph four-dimensional junior spacecraft. When Curran telephoned the base later, he was told: \"We don't give interviews. . . . You the facts you need. . . . You've gone back to the Empire.\" In March 1965, and again in 1968, John F. Reeves made contact with aliens. Known as the \"spaceman of Brooksville,\" Florida, he subsequently built a 23-foot obelisk as a testimonial to the encounters. In 1980, he lost his home and the monu\u00ad ment to tax collectors and now lives in a trailer. When Curran visited him Reeves was 86. Writes the author: \"His newspaper clippings are kept in an old suitcase that he hauls out for anyone who wants to see. A dog-eared book contains the autographs of people who came to see his UFO monument, among them Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, Pat Boone, Tuesday Weld.\" John Reeves's biggest regret, reports Curran, is that he \"will not be buried in the tomb he had prepared for himself at the foot of the obelisk, which bore this legend: 'In this tomb lies the body of John F. Reeves, one of the greatest men of our time, the greatest of them all. Outer space traveller to other planets of our universe.' \" Curran's book brings the world of the UFO devotee to life. It is a subculture that has been either ignored or called the \"lunatic fringe.\" Initially the stories seem 316 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER humorous, even ludicrous. But as one reads further and reflects on the content, one realizes that the real story is one of individuals lost in our society. The photographs and narrative tell a tale of desperate people looking for answers. If you have an interest in UFOs, In Advance of the Landing would be a good investment.

Eden Press, 31A Westminster Ave., Montreal, Quebec H4X 1Y8, 1987. 133 pp. Reveen, who adapted a brief article from this book for our Winter 1987-58 issue, here addresses in greater length the state of hypnosis, with special references to sorting out what is fact and what is Spring 1988 317 fiction. His experience as a stage performer who uses superconsciousness, or hypnosis, in his acts lends good firsthand perspective. Booknote Stephen Jay Gould's latest book, An Urchin in the Storm: Essays about Books and Ideas (W. W. Norton, New York, 1987), concludes with a five-chapter section \"In Praise of Reason\" (coincidentally the title of the award Gould himself received from CSICOP in 1986). The section includes critical essays on Robert Jastrow's The Enchanted Loom, Fritjof Capra's The Algeny, and \"The Quack Detector,\" Gould's tribute to the reason and sanity of Martin Gardner's Science: Good, Bad and Bogus. \u2014Kendrick Frazier Belfield, Dominic. \"Nessie Keeps Her Head Down.\" New Scientist, October 29, 1987, p. 71.

Fairly decent article on UFO abductees' claims (the final three pages are virtually all well- informed critical commentary).

It does not stand still for long, and it is never boring. Oh, among some poor souls, including even intellectuals in fields of high scholarship, science is frequently misperceived. Many see it as only a body of facts, promulgated from on high in musty, unintelligible textbooks, a collection of un\u00ad changing precepts defended with authoritarian vigor. Others view it as nothing but a cold, dry, narrow, plodding, rule-bound process\u2014the scientific method: hidebound, linear, and left brained. These people are the victims of their own stereotypes. They are destined to view the world of science with a set of blinders. They know nothing of the tumult, cacophony, rambunctiousness, and tendentiousness of the actual scientific process, let alone the creativity, passion, and joy of discovery. And they are likely to know little of the continual procession of new insights and discoveries that every day, in some way, change our view (if not theirs) of the natural world. The past year was filled with examples of such new developments.... \u2014Kendrick Frazier, \"The Year in Science: An Overview,\" in 1988 Yearbook of Science and the Future, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. 320 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Follow-up Response to 'Past Tongues Remembered?' IN \"PAST TONGUES Remembered?\" (SI, Summer 1987) Sarah G. Thomason argues that the evidence for reincarnation in Ian Stevenson's case studies in responsive xenoglossy is inadequate because in none of these cases do the subjects manifest sufficient linguistic skill to warrant the claim that they know the language in question. She concludes that nobody has ever spoken in an unlearned language and hence, to the extent that such a claim is offered as evidence for belief in reincarnation, so much the worse for belief in reincarnation. But she is wrong. Thomason offers four basic arguments: 1. Native speakers typically have a vocabulary of thousands of words; but Steven\u00ad son's subjects (for example, the subject in the Gretchen case) manifest a vocabulary in the allegedly unlearned language of scarcely more than 120 words and, moreover, the subjects respond in just a word or two. 2. The supposition that Stevenson's subjects (like Gretchen) know a language they haven't learned because they respond or converse in a language they have not learned is false because they cannot be said to converse in it at all. In defense of this second argument Thomason notes that (a) Gretchen speaks in short responses to other people's questions and often her responses are simply repetitions of what the interviewer said; (b) of her 172 other responses, 42 are ja/nein answers that cannot, for various reasons, count as evidence for knowing the language; (c) of Gretchen's 102 remaining answers to questions asked her in German only 28 answers in German are appropriate. For various reasons, the rest of Gretchen's answers (74) are inappro\u00ad priate or \"cop-outs\" (p. 371). 3. Gretchen does indeed understand some few German words, but we surely do not need a paranormal explanation for her knowledge of a few German words or phrases. Research into the subject's background turns up a few opportunities for limited exposure to German\u2014World War II movies, a look at a German book (p. 371). 4. Stevenson's explanation of Gretchen's inadequacies (near total lack of grammar and minimal vocabulary) either are not testable or are otherwise inadequate). In the end, Thomason proposes two tests to determine whether a subject is speaking in an unlearned language: (1) Ask the subject to translate a basic word list into the so-called unlearned language. (2)'Read the subject a simple story in the unlearned language and have the subject answer simple questions about it. The first two arguments offered by Thomason reduce to the same claim, which is simply that the subjects in the cases examined by Stevenson are, by all linguistic standards, too linguistically impoverished to warrant the claim that they know the language in which they are responding; and if they do not know the language in which they are responding, they can hardly be said to be responding in an unlearned Spring 1988 321 language. In reply, the first point to keep in mind is that not all cases are relevantly like the Gretchen case. The Jensen case, for example, involves a subject speaking medieval Swedish; and even though Jensen speaks as haltingly as does Gretchen, we cannot explain Jensen's limited but appropriate responses in medieval Swedish by appeal to casual contact with books, movies, or people speaking medieval Swedish. Moreover, the transcript from the Sharada case (see Stevenson's Unlearned Languages, University of Virginia Press, 1984, pp. 78 ff.) is very much unlike the Gretchen or the Jensen case in that it is very rich in detail and the subject speaks Bengali noncontro- versially fluently with a rich grammatical and vocabulary base. Second, and more important, Thomason's strategy is to generalize from an analy\u00ad sis of the Gretchen case as inadequate because (a) the subject responds with a very limited vocabulary and with an equally limited grammatical dexterity and (b) the subject cannot be said to respond in an unlearned language if the subject can only respond appropriately 28 times out of 147. However, it would be a mistake to generalize from the Gretchen case because the reason offered for (a) would not hold in other cases, such as the Jensen case and the Sharada case. Moreover, even if we grant that, out of a possible 147, Gretchen offered only 28 appropriate responses (which were not single-word or ja/nein answers) in German to questions asked in German, how do we account for her understanding the questions and her responding appropriately in German in the 28 cases? Thoma\u00ad son's only answer here is that such linguistic facility as Gretchen manifests can be readily accounted for by casual contact with either movies in which German is spoken (as though one could understand fluent German in movies without already knowing it) or books written in German. But this answer is unsatisfactory. After all, for reasons just mentioned, it certainly cannot be generalized to the Jensen case or the Sharada case. More significant, if anybody reads the Gretchen transcript very closely, the appro\u00ad priateness of the responses in at least the 28 cases cannot plausibly be accounted for in the way Thomason suggests, because the appropriateness of the responses depends on Gretchen's clearly understanding grammatically well-formed sentences and ques\u00ad tions put to her by the interviewer. The granted appropriateness of the responses in the 28 instances carries with it the inference that the subject understood at least 28 grammatically well-formed, unrehearsed, and unanticipated sentences. So, even if Gretchen responded appropriately in only 28 instances (out of 147), that in itself shows a firm capacity to understand the simple grammatical forms of the language, and it is difficult to see how that capacity can be acquired by casual contact with World War II movies and German books. The plain truth of the matter is that if anybody responded appropriately in German to 28 randomly selected questions asked in German, we would all say that that person understood or knew German\u2014 even if we were to go on to say that the person did not understand or speak the language very well. In response to the third argument, the arguments just offered show that we cannot plausibly explain the number of appropriate responses in any cases noted so far by casual or indirect contact with the language in which the subject responds. With regard to Thomason's fourth argument, namely, that Stevenson's expla\u00ad nation of the linguistic inadequacies of Gretchen et al. is either unverifiable or unconvincing, there are two replies. First, although Stevenson readily admits that Gretchen and Jensen speak haltingly and basically monosyllabically, he would prob\u00ad ably request that Thomason take a close look at the Sharada case, in which there 322 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER can be no question of fluency. Second, and most important, in spite of the fact that Thomason asserts the contrary, Stevenson is not at all compelled, or philosophically required, to explain the linguistic inadequacies of Gretchen. The strength of Steven\u00ad son's position is that there is no explanation for the successful responses other than that the subject is speaking in, and understands, an unlearned language. Stevenson might just as well refuse to explain, or plead ignorance of, why Gretchen and Jensen do not seem to be very fluent. What needs to be explained is not why these subjects are not very fluent but, rather, how they manage to have the comprehension and capacity to speak as much as they do in an unlearned language. We would never ask why a four-year-old is not very fluent in his mother tongue, but we certainly would ask how a four-year-old could speak (even if not very fluently) a language we knew he had never been exposed to. For all these reasons, Thomason's various arguments are not very convincing. Even so, however, nobody should have any objections to Thomason's proposed tests for determining whether a person is actually speaking in an unlearned language. Such tests seem certainly sufficient. However, if the argument I offer here is correct, because Gretchen, Sharada, and Jensen all respond appropriately and frequently in a language that they have not learned, it seems that those tests are already satisfied. Robert F. Almeder Professor of Philosophy Georgia State University Reply to 'Response to \"Past Tongues Remembered?\" ' Robert F. Almeder makes main claims: first, Gretchen's small number of appro\u00ad priate German responses do too require a paranormal explanation; second, even if they don't, two of Stevenson's cases that I did not analyze\u2014Jensen (Swedish) and Sharada (Bengali)\u2014certainly do. I'll comment on Almeder's second point first. The reason I analyzed the Gretchen case was that I know more German than I do Swedish and Bengali, so it was an easier job; and the reason I didn't discuss all three was that my time and SKEPTICAL INQUIRER'S space are limited. Almeder is mistaken in his apparent belief that Jensen and Sharada provide better evidence for paranormal linguistic competence than Gretchen does. Jensen is very similar to Gretchen lin\u00ad guistically: a tiny vocabulary, a few independent appropriate responses and some wildly inappropriate responses\u2014e.g., \"my wife\" in response to a question about what he would pay for some item at the market. In fact, the same basic argument against Stevenson's paranormal proposal can be made (with, of course, some differences in detail) for both Jensen and Gretchen. Sharada seems relatively fluent, although (as I remarked in a footnote in my article) Stevenson gives too little data to permit a detailed analysis of her linguistic performance. However, his own discussion shows clearly that the subject could easily have learned a lot of Bengali in a perfectly ordinary fashion, and that she had a motive for doing so. Moreover, she spoke natively an Indie language that is very closely related to Bengali\u2014so close that perhaps 80 percent of the basic vocabulary items and a comparable portion of the Spring 1988 323 grammatical features are similar or identical. And she had studied Sanskrit, which is a close approximation to the linguistic ancestor of all the modern Indie languages, including Bengali. Under these circumstances, it would take a great leap of faith to abandon skepticism about Sharada's alleged paranormal linguistic ability. Almeder's main substantive argument is that Gretchen's answers to questions show \"a firm capacity to understand the simple grammatical forms of the language.\" If, on an exam, a student of mine answered a German question about what he eats for breakfast with an erroneous German translation for \"bedroom,\" I would not characterize his grasp of the simple grammatical (or lexical) forms of the language as firm. Moreover, Almeder's response focuses on my mention of the subject's previous casual contacts with German but ignores my argument that a large amount of successful guesswork is predictable in a very restricted conversational framework like that of the Gretchen interviews, given a minimal prior acquaintance with a few German words and phrases. Laymen may be startled to learn that people can guess right, often, about the meanings of things said to them in a language they don't know. This is actually quite easy to do if the situation provides clues (as in the Gretchen case) to a questioner's intent. Interesting examples can be found, for in\u00ad stance, in answers to the questions that judges in American courtrooms ask non- English-speaking defendants in order to decide if an interpreter is needed for a trial. Of course I can't give a precise estimate of just how many successful guesses can be predicted. Almeder finds 28 (including some repetitions, out of a total 102 questions) an impressive figure; I don't. That's why I proposed tests whose results would be conclusive; they would help us avoid fruitless arguments of this sort. Sarah G. Thomason Department of Linguistics University of Pittsburgh Logo Competition When we opened the competition for a CSICOP logo with a notice in the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, we did not expect hundreds of entries from our subscribers around the world. The entries ranged from the simple to the complex in design, from rough sketches to finished artwork. After viewing all the entries, the Executive Council decided on one drawn by Tony Chace, an airline pilot from Washington State. It was chosen for its simplicity and clean lines. The globe represents the universal nature of CSICOP. (\u2014^CSICOP : 324 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER Forum Teaching the Nature of Science SURVEYS of the American popula\u00ad tion have shown that a large number of us believe in some type of pseudosci- ence. A Gallup poll conducted in 1986 (see SI, Spring 1987) showed that 52 per\u00ad cent of youngsters between the ages of 13 and 17 believe in astrology and 46 percent of them believe in ESP. Happily, the numbers are much lower for belief in ghosts, Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness mon\u00ad ster. Many of these pseudoscientific be\u00ad liefs will be carried into adulthood. Why do so many Americans believe in pseudoscience? Although there may be many reasons, from my experience as an educator and a scientist I believe that science education has failed to teach youngsters the basics of a scientific atti\u00ad tude. A survey of introductory biology, chemistry, and physics college texts clear\u00ad ly indicates that scientific inquiry and all its ramifications are given very little, if any, treatment. Most texts devote only a few pages to the scientific method. Some texts may devote an entire chapter, but this is hardly adequate. Since most secondary-school and col\u00ad lege science texts do not adequately dis\u00ad cuss the scientific method and scientific inquiry, neither do high school and col\u00ad lege science courses. Science teachers are preoccupied with teaching students what scientists have learned rather than how they have learned it. After I realized that the mission of science educators should be to teach stu\u00ad dents how to reason as well as to teach them what scientists have learned about our natural and physical worlds, I started to incorporate discussions and laboratory exercises on the scientific method into my courses. The writings of many CSICOP members are used as source material and supplementary course read\u00ad ing. I believe that my students have now begun to look at pseudoscientific claims with a skeptical eye. During the summer of 1983, the University of New Haven convened a small group of faculty and deans to develop a university-wide core curricu\u00ad lum. This group designed a curriculum that emphasized skills in communication and reasoning, among others. In order to develop reasoning skills the faculty included courses in mathematics and computer science and a new interdiscipli\u00ad nary course entitled \"The Nature of Sci\u00ad ence.\" The latter course was modeled Spring 1988 325 after one offered at Wesleyan University (Middletown, Conn.) and covers \"the various aspects of the natural and social sciences and the philosophy of scientific inquiry.\" Some of the topics addressed were the acquisition of knowledge, de\u00ad ductive and inductive logic, characteristics of scientific knowledge, scientific meth\u00ad odology and serendipity, science vs. pseu- doscience, the relation of theory to data, conditions of theory application, causal and noncausal explanation, rational and empirical conceptions of science, scientific fraud, and the interpretation of data. The course is staffed by faculty with experi\u00ad ence in many fields, including the sci\u00ad ences, engineering, the history of science, and philosophy. As expected, the greatest opposition SEVERAL years ago, a group of Canadian amateur astronomers were conducting routine meteor observations when they noticed a flash of light in the sky (MacRobert 1985a, 1985b, 1986). The brightness lasted a fraction of a second and had an intensity comparable to the brighter stars in the sky. Initially, the flash was dismissed as a \"head-on meteor\" (i.e., a meteor aimed directly at the ob\u00ad server, an infrequent occurrence). How\u00ad ever, the observers remembered other bright flashes that had occurred in the same area of the sky (in the constellation of Perseus). As a result of these coin\u00ad cidences, they started to monitor the region in Perseus both photographically and with the unaided eye. The final ac\u00ad cumulated monitoring time was several hundred hours, during which they spotted 24 bright flashes. More important, one of the flashes was successfully photo\u00ad graphed, proving that psychological or physiological effects could not explain all of the flashes. to the \"Nature of Science\" course came from scientists and engineers who claimed that they did not want \"nonscientists\" telling them how to teach their courses and run their programs. Although the course is officially included in the core curriculum, it still has its detractors. If more science educators and con\u00ad cerned citizens demanded that secondary and college curricula address the nature of science, perhaps fewer people would graduate from our schools holding firmly to pseudoscientific beliefs. \u2014Charles L. Vigue Charles L. Vigue is professor of biology and environmental science at the University of New Haven, Connecticut. On this basis, they wrote a paper and submitted it to Astrophysical Journal, the most prestigious professional astronom\u00ad ical journal. The article had serious trou\u00ad ble during refereeing for two reasons. First, the information it contained and the quality of the writing were poor. This problem was solved in the second draft, when a professional astronomer helped rewrite the paper using the conventions and standards expected in material for publication. Second, there were a number of technical difficulties that cast doubt on the authors' interpretation of the \"Perseus flasher\" as an astronomical phe\u00ad nomenon. These troubles were not ad\u00ad dressed when (after three iterations) the journal's editor decided to accept the paper (Katz 1986) for publication any\u00ad way. I believe that the primary reason the editor accepted the paper despite the referees was that (on the offhand chance that this was a major discovery) he did not want to appear as a villain in history \u2014another \"Catholic church\" oppressing The Perseus \"Galileo.\" If the Perseus flasher was indeed an astronomical object, then it would cer\u00ad tainly be one of the major discoveries of the decade. As a result, many astrono\u00ad mers spent large amounts of time check\u00ad ing the claim. Difficulties arose when 3,476 hours of monitoring by photogra\u00ad phy, CCDs, television, and the naked eye revealed no flashes (Corso, Ringwald, and Harris 1987; Schaefer et al. 1987)\u2014 despite the claim of one bright flash every 12 hours (Katz 1986). A more serious difficulty arose when routine patrol pho\u00ad tographs exposed simultaneously with nine of the reported flashes showed no new objects (Schaefer et al. 1987; Halli- day, Feldman, and Blackwell 1987; Hudec 1987). On top of that, P. Maley performed a series of calculations for six of the reported flashes and found that in all cases an artificial Earth satellite was at the right position at the right time (Schaefer et al. 1987; Maley 1987). The idea here is that a flat surface on a satel\u00ad lite can cause a brief glint of sunlight to be reflected to the observer. Such glints have been frequently reported in the more obscure astronomical literature, and their rate, duration, and brightness are the same as for the Canadian flashes (Schae\u00ad fer et al. 1987). Indeed, Maley has moni\u00ad tored some of the guilty satellites and has seen them flash at similar phase angles (Schaefer et al. 1987; Halliday, Feldman, and Blackwell 1987). With this evidence, the Perseus flasher was solved. This whole incident could easily have evolved into a classic fringe-science issue like UFOs or cryptozoology. I believe that it was the scientific background of the Canadian amateurs that made them not even think of turning to the para\u00ad normal. They proceeded exactly as is appropriate (i.e., they gathered evidence and then published a simple statement of the facts with minimal interpretation). However, after the paper appeared, the behavior of the individuals in the Cana\u00ad dian group became more appropriate for fringe scientists. This behavior included harassment of an amateur astronomical journal (Berry 1987) and astronomers, as well as dark hints of coverups of secret military projects (MacRobert 1987). \u2014Bradley E.

Address them to Letters to the Editor, SKEPTICAL INQUIRER, 3025 Palo Alto Dr. NE, Albuquerque, NM 87111. Rich and beautiful reality Paul Kurtz, in his commentary \"Is There Intelligent Life on Earth? (Fall 1987), laments the rise of paranormal claims despite the best efforts of skeptics. But why have the skeptics failed? As debunkers, we are perceived to be \"closed-minded,\" negative, and somehow opposed to imagination. Logic is often referred to as \"cold.\" It seems that many people want so strongly to believe in some \"higher\" and more appealing reality that they do not see any value in being skeptical. I think we have more to do than just debunk. We should demon\u00ad strate, repeatedly and eloquently, the positive benefits of a skeptical attitude. The negative benefits, such as not having one's pockets drained by charla\u00ad tans, are easily understood. But the posi\u00ad tive benefits of skepticism are more sub\u00ad tle, and more important. By filtering out the simplistic, deadend explanations (ghosts, goblins, etc.), we hope to arrive at a perception of reality that is not only more effective, but richer. Good scientists are seldom cold and clinical. They are warm (often infectious\u00ad ly), because they love digging deeper and deeper into how things work. Far from being closed-minded, they enjoy the end\u00ad less twists and turns that reality offers. But they are skeptical of too-simple answers (\"It's magic,\" \"It's beyond our understanding,\" etc.) that would close the door on further questions. The workings of atoms and molecules, of cells and DNA and RNA, of spiders and trees, planets and galaxies, present a much more complex and beautiful reality than is ever imagined by the parapsy- chologists or astrologers. We should ex\u00ad press that positive viewpoint often, to combat the idea that skeptics are merely \"spoilers.\" Rodney Forcade Orem, Utah Belief systems and wellness The article by Stephen Barrett, M.D., \"Homeopathy: Is It Medicine?\" and the one by Lewis Jones, \"Alternative Thera\u00ad pies\" (SI, Fall 1987) are of interest in their consideration of scientific ap\u00ad proaches to healing compared with those having less demonstrable efficacy or less reliable research data. However, both authors appear to overlook an underlying mechanism of central importance in all of this: the individual's belief system as it influences illness or health. Under certain conditions, unconscious beliefs, linked to the magical thinking of childhood, may override the thin veneer of rationality acquired by civilized adults. This is exemplified in the persistence of superstitions like \"knock on wood,\" \"the evil eye,\" and others, despite our improved education and mass communi\u00ad cation. Primitive peoples and neurotic individuals openly exhibit ritualistic be\u00ad haviors and symptoms traceable to the powerful substrate of magical beliefs. Witness the effects of voodoo on Haitian believers. Witch doctors, shamans, Eastern healers, and modern physicians all share a power to heal derived from culturally 330 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER reinforced belief systems\u2014their own and that of the ill. An operative medical tenet has been non nocere, do no harm. This seems a desirable dictum for all therapies. In the United States, it is estimated that approximately 80 percent of office visits to doctors are because of psycho\u00ad somatic disturbances\u2014symptoms having no demonstrable organic pathology. The medical treatment usually consists of tests and X-rays, a prescription for pills, reas\u00ad surance, and other placebo-effect ap\u00ad proaches. Placebos, including the laying on of hands, are effective precisely because of the strong belief in the power and effec\u00ad tiveness of the trusted healer. However, it turns out it is not apparently all smoke and mirrors. The interface between belief system and wellness appears to be impor\u00ad tantly connected to neurochemistry, im\u00ad mune and nervous systems, and other complex mechanisms on the frontiers of current scientific investigation. Unfortunately, no matter how tech\u00ad nologically sophisticated we may become, we will still operate with the same basic emotional equipment as our progenitors, having limited conscious control. So the ubiquitousness of belief systems will likely continue to be a force to be reckoned with. Given this important consideration, it seems to me that in order to be truly scientific in our assessment of treatment, medical or otherwise, our paradigm needs to include belief-system effects in addition to double-blind studies if we are to satis\u00ad factorily come to grips with the question of what works for whom. Martin Reiser, Director Behavioral Science Services Section Los Angeles Police Dept. Los Angeles, Calif. Homeopathic ghost? In \"Homeopathy: Is It Medicine?\" I found most interesting the report that the very reputable Lancet had published a study indicating the efficacy of a homeo\u00ad pathic medicine for hay fever. Isn't this on the order of actually hav\u00ad ing a ghost hooked up for an ECG or a UFO on hand to be examined by a skep\u00ad tical inquirer? If some questioned area provides even one hard fact, isn't it time to go all out in scientific inquiry with the hope of broadening the field of possibly useful knowledge? Daniel Papish Eugene, Ore. Homeopathic dilutions Dr. Barrett's article on homeopathy re\u00ad minds me that critics of this method often do not attack it enough on simple scien\u00ad tific and logical grounds, grounds simple and logical enough to place doubt in the mind of an audience with average general knowledge. The critic usually asks, \"What about Avogadro's law?\" The homeopath accepts this implication and then starts waffling about \"vital forces.\" The result is a draw in the mind of uncommitted onlookers. Why not go on to ask with what the \"drug\" is diluted? Tap water? Of course not. Distilled water that still contains ppm of most things at a dilution that dwarfs homeopathic doses? Well, er. Ion-exchanged water that still contains ppb of practically everything and yet dwarfs homeopathic doses? Er, well. Really pure water prepared according to a secret process? What about the sub\u00ad stances it originally contained? Haven't they left possibly antagonistic vital forces behind and hasn't your really pure water since dissolved some of its container or the atmosphere? Silence. Lets try another tack. What is the pH of your water? Seven? What does that mean? Okay, I'll tell you. It means that there are 10-7 g- ions of H per liter, and this is an inherent property of pure water. What are you treating with this enormous homeopathic dose of H? Terminal flatulence? Critics should cultivate the double- whammy, triple-whammy, or whatever it takes! David J. Fisher Cardiff, Wales, U.K. Spring 1988 331 Quackery and government Is there nothing sacred for the SKEPTICAL INQUIRER? I was very impressed with William Jarvis for authoring such a bold article (\"Chiropractic: A Skeptical View,\" Fall 1987). It was not only bold; it was well researched and clear. I also con\u00ad gratulate the editor for choosing to open discussion on what must be one of the most widely accepted scams in the world. But chiropractic is not the only widely accepted scam. In the same issue was an article by Claude Pepper (\"Quackery: The Need for Federal, State, and Local Response\"), which brought to mind the question \"Are we ever guilty of creating a scam in our attempt to suppress one?' In his book Losing Ground, Charles Murray documented an almost perfect record of government's failure to elimi\u00ad nate poverty with its technique of direct intervention. He showed that any attempt to remove responsibility from human beings inevitably results in their having less ability to handle further responsibility in that aspect of their lives. Yet Congress\u00ad man Claude Pepper's article, and prob\u00ad ably his entire life, is devoted to doing just that. He would have experts study what is right and wrong with health\u00ad care products and services and use the power of the state to enforce their opinions. In contrast, notice in the following examples what abstaining from interven\u00ad tion does. The consumer electronics field, like health care, is a marketplace activity, but it is a much freer marketplace. There are experts. But none has the power of the state behind him. It is also a free market with respect to speech. The print media are free to say anything they like, with only the reader as the censor. Yes, there are some dumb electronic gadgets out there; and yes, there is some printed material out there that might harm some people. But, by and large, censorship as \"the responsibility of the consumer\" minimizes losses and optimizes bene\u00ad fits. A belief in command and control as the solution to society's problems is a bigger flimflam than even chiropractic. If you wish to see people take as much control of their health as they do their wardrobe, stop government intervention in health. Walter Clark Fullerton, Calif. Acupuncture action I have been a subscriber to SI for some time, as well as a supporter for the Com\u00ad mittee. But as editor of the International Journal of Chinese Medicine and admin\u00ad istrator of the Center for Chinese Medi\u00ad cine, I find it difficult to accept Lewis Jones's one-sided presentation of acu\u00ad puncture (Fall 1987). I particularly dislike the \"When Harm Follows\" portion of the presentation. Certainly acupuncture, like any other medical specialty, has its horror stories. But to present them as though they are the rule is unconscionable. In the first place, sterile, disposable, individually packaged needles are now the standard, if not the rule, in the United States. These needles are used once and disposed of safely. And I doubt that there is a li\u00ad censed practitioner in the United States who has ever used cutoff needles for permanent retention. I am certain that acupuncturists have left fewer such needles in patients than surgeons have left instruments, sponges, and their cat's lunch. I would argue with every statement in the \"acupuncture\" portion of this arti\u00ad cle. It is only true that it is almost im\u00ad possible to design an adequate double- blind protocol for acupuncture. The rest of what is said is contradicted by an exceptionally rich literature in the past five to ten years. Since Goldberg first postulated receptor sites for opiates, there has been much proved to establish a scientific and rational basis for much of the action of acupuncture. Jack E. Booker Center for Chinese Medicine Los Angeles, Calif. 332 THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER SETI dimensions Just a brief note on your report about Jill Tarter's SETI talk at the CSICOP conference (SI, Fall 1987). Tarter was mistaken when she counted nine search dimensions, including three in space. There are only two spatial dimensions\u2014 right ascension and declination\u2014required to specify antenna pointing, i.e., one need search only the \"surface\" of the celestial sphere. The continuum of radial distance is visible to an antenna at any given position. Skip Newhall Valencia, Calif. ETI in-proximity? In \"The Burden of Skepticism,\" I noticed that Carl Sagan employed only a little sarcasm regarding UFOs. This may be because in his own articles in Icarus he recognizes, and has contributed to, the hypothesis that extraterrestrial intelli\u00ad gence (ETI) may well be in our vicinity and aware of mankind, and employ vehi\u00ad cles with seemingly magical capabilities. In Icarus, 19 (1973): 350, he emphasized what is now known as Clarke's law: \"Such societies [of ETI, much advanced over us] will have discovered laws of nature and invented technologies whose applications will appear to us indistin\u00ad guishable from magic.\" This would much more likely than not include the tech\u00ad nology of efficient travel within the galaxy for exploration or other purposes, since most ETI in advance of us would be millions of years ahead, not just thousands. With W. Newman in 1981 (Icarus, 46:295) he wrote, \"Civilizations, say, 106 years more advanced than ours may have little interest in interstellar colonization (while retaining an under\u00ad standable concern about younger, more aggressive civilizations).\" Interested readers should peruse this and the more recent literature (especially the Quart. J. Roy. Astron. Soc. and J. British Inter\u00ad planetary Soc.) to learn the plausibility and scientific credibility of this in-proximity school of thought regarding ETI. The in-proximity hypothesis agrees with Sagan's implication that ETI might be as intelligent as we, and allows them to have a strategy for handling rare \"emerging\" societies like ours. If this strategy should include occasional pur\u00ad poseful sightings of their craft, and oc\u00ad casional covert contacts with humans over a multi-decade period, should we reject those possibilities simply because the claims would often be accompanied by \"emotional vulnerability\"? Or because the in-proximity hypothesis makes SETI, via radio telescope, less credible? ETI strategy just might be intelligent enough to turn the behavior of skeptic-extremists to its advantage. James W. Deardorff Professor Emeritus Department of Atmospheric Sciences Oregon State Univ. Corvallis, Wash. Home still an enigma My friend Antony Flew takes me to task in his letter (Fall 1987) because, in de\u00ad fending Crookes against Martin Gard\u00ad ner's charge of being an unreliable witness in the case of Daniel Home, I failed to mention the work of Trevor Hall. When I first read Trevor Hall's The Spiritualists (1962) I could not imagine how any rational person could any longer doubt that Crookes was indeed guilty of deceiving his colleagues by aiding and abetting a fraudulent medium, Florence Cook, in return for her sexual favors. However, when I then went on to read what other scholars had to say, notably the late George Medhurst and George Zorab, who were at least as well informed as Hall, I began to realize how very selec\u00ad tive Hall had been in concocting his case. When, therefore, I was recently invited to contribute to a Festschrift in honor of George Zorab, I decided this would be a good opportunity to review this long\u00ad standing controversy. Accordingly I re\u00ad read Hall's book, now renamed The Spring 1988 333 Medium and the Scientist (1984). My confidence in the author was further shaken when I noted that there was no hint, in a footnote or preface, of the criti\u00ad cisms that his original publication had provoked and, worse still, even the straightforward errors of fact that his critics had pointed out were preserved intact. In my paper \"George Zorab and 'Katie King,' \" I came to the conclusion that Hall's scenario does not hold up; there were just too many discrepancies that the author fails to address. Flew may disagree with my conclusions, but he will at least appreciate that my omission was not due to ignorance or to evasion but to the fact that I no longer believe that Crookes was guilty as charged. Flew further reminds me that Hall has recently published his own attempt to demolish Home: The Enigma of Daniel Home: Medium or Fraud? (1984). Yet what struck me most forcibly when I read this book was that, while Hall has many interesting things to say about Home, he nowhere gets near to the central puzzle of Home's career, namely, how he per\u00ad suaded so many distinguished people that they had witnessed the levitations of large tables. May I draw Flew's attention to a lengthy and trenchant review of this book by the late E. J. Dingwall (Zetetic Scholar, 12/13, 1987)? It may well have been the last thing Dingwall ever pub\u00ad lished. Since Dingwall has been described by Hall as \"my colleague of many years,\" it seems fitting to let him have the last word. The final sentence of his review reads: \"The chief lesson to be learnt from this book is that the enigma of D. D. Home remains an enigma and there is no sign of it being resolved.\" . John Beloff Dept. of Psychology Univ. of Edinburgh Scotland, U.K. New remote-viewing test The remote-viewing paradigm inaugu\u00ad rated by Targ and Puthoff (Nature, 1974) is intriguing but suffers from well-known methodological problems (Marks, SI, Summer 1982). I recently began teaching a course on paranormal investigation and designed an implementation of remote viewing that seems less vulnerable, as a class assignment. This implementation seems to allow for whatever \"psychic attunement\" seems desirable, without allowing for cueing. Pairs of students went together to five locations on the campus of the University of Calgary, took photos, and formed joint impressions. One member of each pair then went to an interior room on the campus, while the other proceeded to my office, where s/ he picked up a list of five random digits picked (with replacement) from the numbers 1 through 5. At pre\u00ad arranged times the viewer proceeded to the site designated by the random num\u00ad ber, while the percipient would attempt to choose the photo that corresponded to the site at which the viewer currently stood. At the conclusion of a run of five attempts at remote viewing, separate re\u00ad ports were filed at my office. This pro\u00ad cedure was followed four times for a total of twenty attempts at remote view\u00ad ing. The results were disappointing. The highest score was 7 correct out of 20, which is not even significant at the 5 per\u00ad cent level. Overall the distribution of scores was typical of a sample from a Poisson (4) distribution, as expected in the absence of ESP.

The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal attempts to encourage the critical investigation of paranormal and fringe-science claims from a responsible, scientific point of view and to disseminate factual informa\u00ad tion about the results of such inquiries to the scientific community and the public. To carry out these objectives the Committee: Maintains a network of people interested in critically examining claims of the para\u00ad normal. Prepares bibliographies of published materials that carefully examine such claims. Encourages and commissions research by objective and impartial inquiry in areas where it is needed. Convenes conferences and meetings. Publishes articles, monographs, and books that examine claims of the paranormal. Does not reject claims on a priori grounds, antecedent to inquiry, but rather examines them objectively and carefully. The Committee is a nonprofit scientific and educa\u00ad tional organization. THE SKEPTICAL INQUIRER is its official journal. RETURN POSTAGE GUARANTEED "}
