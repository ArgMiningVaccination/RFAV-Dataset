There are residency and fellowship programs that are not accredited by the ACGME. In some cases, this is because the ACGME does not yet accredit a particular specialty or subspecialty. In other cases, programs and/or institutions have opted not to apply for accreditation from the ACGME. Residency programs that are not accredited by the ACGME do not receive Medicare funding from CMS for Direct Graduate Medical Education (DGME) and Indirect Medical Education (IME).
