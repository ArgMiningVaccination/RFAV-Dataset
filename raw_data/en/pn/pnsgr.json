The cellular etiology of this heterogeneity is poorly 37 understood. Here, we generated and analyzed a single -cell transcriptome atlas of 49,859 CRC 38 cells from 16 patients , validated with an additional 31,383 cells from an independent CRC patient 39 cohort . We describe subclonal transcriptomic heterogeneity of CRC tumor epithelial cells , as well 40 as discrete stromal populations of cancer -associat ed fibroblasts (CAF s). Within CRC CAFs, we 41 identify the transcriptional signature of specific subtype s (CAF -S1 and CAF -S4) that significantly 42 stratifies overall survival in more than 1,500 CRC patients with bulk transcriptomic data . We also 43 two C AF-S1 subpopulations, ecm-myCAF and TGF\u00df -myCAF , known to 44 with primary resi stance to immunotherapies . We demonstrate that scRNA analysis of malignant, 45 stromal , and immune cells exhibit a more complex picture than portrayed by bulk trans criptomic - 46 based Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) classification. By demonstrating an abundant 47 degree of heterogene ity amongst these cell types, our work shows that CRC is best represented 48 in a transcriptomic continuum crossing traditional classification systems boundaries . Overall, this 49 CRC cell map provides a framework to re-evaluate CRC tumor biology with implications for clinical 50 trial design and therapeutic development . 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 .

Approximately 50% of patients experience disease relapse 68 following curative -intent surgical resection and chemotherapy3,4. Despite the high incidence and 69 mortality of advanced CRC, few effective therapies have been approved in the past several 70 decades5. One barrier to the development of efficacious therapeutic s is the biological 71 heterogeneity of CRC and its variable clinical course6. While landmark studies from The Cancer 72 Genome Atlas (TCGA) have defined the somatic mutational landscape within CRC, several 73 studies have shown that stromal signatures, including fibroblasts and cytotoxic T cells, are likely 74 the main drivers of clinical outcomes7-12. These findings suggest that the clinical phenotypes of 75 CRC and by extension, its tumor b iology , is shaped by a complex niche of heterotypic cell 76 interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME)8-12. 77 78 Bulk gene expression analys es by several independent groups have identified distinct CRC 79 subtypes13-15. Reflect ing both the tumor and TME, an international consortium published the 80 Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS), which proposed four distinct subtypes of CRC15. 81 Unfortunately, the association between CMS and meaningful therapeutic re sponse to specific 82 agents have shown inconsistent results across studies and CMS lacks a concordance between 83 primary and metastatic CRC tumors, limiting its utility thus fa r in clinical decision making16-23. As 84 a result, an improved CMS classification or an alternative classification system is required to 85 improve clinical utility . 86 87 To overcome the limitations of bulk -RNA sequenc e profiling, we utilized single -cell RNA 88 sequencing (scRNA -seq) to more thoroughl y evaluate the CRC subtypes at the molecular level , 89 including within the context of the currently defined CMS classification .

The CAF population's clinical and prognostic significance became apparent 92 when CAF signatures were applied to large, independent CRC transcriptomic cohorts . 93 94 RESULTS 95 We profil ed sixteen primary colon tissue samples and eight adjacent non -malig nant ti ssues (24 in 96 total) using droplet -based, scRNA -seq.

Thus, a total of 81,242 high - 118 quality cells were profiled to produce a single -cell map of 39 colorectal cancer patients .

Clusters were chiefly influenced by colonic epithelial markers, including those for CHGA ) 130 (Supplementary Fig. 2 a and Supplementary Table 2). Tumor cells exhibited a high degree of 131 de-differentiated state of plasticity possibly accounting for lasting cancer grow th (Supplementary 132 Fig. 2b )30. Each distinct tumor -derived cluster was mostly patient -specific, reflecting a high degree 133 of inter -patient tumoral cell hetero geneity. In contrast, epithelial populations derived from non - 134 malignant tissue samples from multiple patients clustered together, a pattern observed in previous 135 studies confirming both normal tissue homeostasis and limited sample batch effects (Fig. 2a)31,32. 136 137 We next aimed to identify gene expression programs shared across these clusters using hallmark 138 pathway analysis33. A strong overlap was observed for multiple pathways such as activation of 139 inflammatory, epithelial -mesenchymal transformation (EMT), immune response, and metabolic 140 pathways ( Fig. 2 b). Interestingly, high microsatellite instability (MSI -H) and microsatellite stable 141 (MSS) CRC tumors, considered clinically separate entities, demonstrated similar pathway 142 .

Some cluster s also showed activation 143 of un ique pathways such as activation of apical junctions and angiogenesis (C6), hypoxia and 144 fatty acid metabolism (C11) and Notch signaling and DNA repair (C14) , among others . However, 145 MSI-H tumors differed from MSS tumors based on immune cell infiltration (Extended Data Fig. 146 1). 147 148 Since intratumoral heterogeneity is recognized as a key mechanism contributing to drug 149 resistance, cancer progression, and recurrence, we next focused on dissecting potential 150 transcriptomic states to identify heterogeneity within each patient's tumor34-37. We found that each 151 tumor specimen contained 2-10 distinct tumor epithelial clusters (Fig. 2c). Gene set variation 152 analysis (GSVA) was performed on cells from individual tumor samples and illustrated the sub- 153 clonal transcriptomic heterogeneity within each specimen (Supplementary Fig. 2c)38. Clusters 154 identified in individual pathway analysis demonstrated the up- or down-regulation of crucial 155 metabolic and oncogenic pathways between samples, suggesting wide phenotype variations 156 between cells from the same tumor39. 157 158 Given the evidence of intratumoral epithelial heterogeneity, we next performed trajectory 159 inference using pseudotime analysis to identify potential alignments or lineage relationships (i.e., 160 right versus left-sided CRC), CMS classification, or MSI status 161 (Fig. 2d)40,41. This analysis also served as a control for inter-patient genomic heterogeneity and 162 provided an orthogonal strategy to confirm the transcriptomic trends we identified. We detected 163 five molecular states (S1n/t to S5n/t) with malignant and normal epithelial cells intermixed along 164 a joint transcriptional trajectory. This observation is consistent with prior studies demonstrating 165 that CRC cells recapitulate normal colon epithelia's multilineage differentiation process as each 166 transcriptional state's pathway activation in both normal and tumor cells was related to normal 167 .

Interestingly, there were no significant associations with anatomic 173 location, CMS classification, or MSI status within our dataset or an independent dataset of 31,383 174 single cells ( Supplementary Fig. 4)29. Hence, in our analysis, CRC development mainly 175 represents a hijacking of the normal epithelial differentiation program, coupled with t he acquisition 176 of embryogenic pathways ( Supplementary Fig. 3)45. 177 178 the tumor microenvironment exhibit diverse phenotypes , 179 and specific subtypes are associated with poor prognosis. 180 181 We next focused on CRC TME subpopulations. High-quality 819 fibroblasts were re-clustered into 182 eight clusters, and the n phenotypically classified into two major subtypes to assess for further 183 CAF heterogeneity .

This fibroblast cluster dichotomy was also observed in the 186 independent CRC patient scRNA -seq dataset of 31,383 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5)29. 187 188 The CAF-S1 and CAF -S4 subtypes showed striking resemblances to (extracellular 189 matrix) and vCAF (vascular) fibroblast subtypes, respectively, as previously de scribed in a mouse 190 breas t cancer mode l47. Most clus ters were found in multiple patients, albeit in varying proportions, 191 signifying shared patterns in CAF transcriptomic programs between patients. Fibroblasts derived 192 from MSI -H tumors were distributed similarly t hroughout these clusters. 193 .

Additionally, 195 CAF-S1 expressed extracellular matrix genes including matrix -modifying enzymes ( LOXL 1 and 196 LOX)47. To determine this population's functional significance, we compared the CAF -S1 197 population transcriptomes to those described recently in breast cancer, lung cancer, and head 198 and neck cancer48. We recovered five CAF subtypes, within the CAF -S1 population, including 199 ecm-myCAF (extracellular; GJB+ ), IL-iCAF ), which were previously divided into two major subtypes : iCAF and myCAF (Fig. 203 3b). Among these five subtypes, ecm-myCAF and TGF-myCAF are known to correlate with 204 immunosuppressive environments and are enriched in tumors with high regulatory T lymphocytes 205 (Tregs) and depleted CD8+ lymphocytes. Additionally, these subtypes are associated with 206 primary immunotherapy resistance in melanoma and lung cancer48. 207 208 The CAF -S4 CAF subtype is vessel -associated, with 210 hypoxia potentially contributing to invasion and metastasis , as has been shown in another stud y 211 47. CAF -S4 clustered into the immature phenotype ( RGS5+, and MYH11+ )(Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 213 4)49. 214 215 Given the correlation between CMS 4 and fibroblast infiltration, w e next sought to test the 216 existence of CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 signatures in bulk transcriptomic data and their association with 217 clinical outcomes15. To this end, we interrogated and carried out a meta -analysis of eight 218 colorectal cancer trans criptomic datasets comprising 1,584 samples. We detected a strong and 219 .

The gene signatures were specific to each CAF -S1 and CAF -S4, thus 223 confirming their existence in TME of CRC and oth er tumor types. 224 225 We found high CAF -S1 and CAF -S4 signatures associated with poor median overall -survival 226 (HR>1, p<0.05), irrespective of CMS subtypes in three independent CRC datasets 227 (Supplementary Fig 7). Additionally, CAF signatures stratified the CMS4 subtype into high - and 228 low-risk overall survival in all dat asets , thus identifying additional heterogeneity and providing 229 prognos tication in this aggressive patient subgroup (Fig. 4b-d). Here, using scRNA -seq, we show 230 for the first time that high CAF infiltration in CRC is associated with poor prognosis across all 231 molecular subtypes , and which further stratifies the CMS4 subgroup into high and low -risk clinical 232 phenotypes in CRC cohorts. 233 234 Single -cell RNA sequencing reveals heterogeneity beyond Consensus Molecular Subtypes 235 in colorectal cancers and offers therapeuti c opportunities. 236 237 The lack of association between tumor epithelia and CMS classification, as well as the survival 238 differences between high - and low -risk CAF signatures across CRC molecular subtypes suggest 239 CRCs are much more heterogeneous than the traditi onal classification systems have indicated 240 (e.g. those systems defined by somatic alterations, epigenomic features , and bulk gene 241 expression data )13,14,50,51. 242 243 Among these the widely adopted CMS classification, which reflects both the malignant cell 244 phenotypes and the TME, classified CRC 4.0 International license available under a(which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

To 246 test our hypothesis, we estimated every cell type fraction using single -cell data from eight pooled 247 datasets (>1,500 samples ) with a m achine -learning algorithm, CIBERSORTx52. When w e 248 compared epithelial, immune , and stromal cell populations among the CMS subtypes , we did not 249 detect a distinct pattern of tumor , immune, or stromal cell signatures across the different CMS 250 subtypes . Each CMS subtype was enriched in these cell types in varying proportions but without 251 a clear distinction between the four subtype s, suggesting a lack of clear separation among the 252 CMS subsets at the single -cell resolution (Fig. 5a-b). Upon analysis of four independent bulk RNA 253 datasets, there was significant discordance in terms of cell phenotype enrichment with respect 254 to each CMS subtype across the datasets except CMS4 which had predominant stromal 255 enrichment (Supplementary Fig s. 8-11)53. These discordant results could be due to intra -patient 256 CMS heterogeneity, intratumoral variation in tumor purity, stromal and immune cell infiltration, 257 and CMS's inability to address tumor/TME-to-tumor/TME variability, among others54. Thus, novel 258 approaches that consider these factors are required to stratify patients for optimal biomarker and 259 therapeutic development. 260 261 Based on the above findings, we postulate that CRC is more accurately represented in a 262 transcri ptomic continuum previously proposed by Ma et al .55. The authors analyzed bulk 263 transcriptomic data using a novel computational framework in which denovo, 264 clustering methods (k-medoid, non-negative-matrix factorization, and consensus demonstrated the existence of CRC in a transcriptomic continuum56-58. They further carried out 266 principal component analysis and robustly validated two principal components, PC Cluster 267 Subtype Scores 1 and 2 (PCS S1 and PCSS2 , respectively) . We reasoned t hat using single -cell 268 data could deepen our understanding of how each cell phenotype contributes to the CRC tumor 269 microenvironment using continuous scores that inform CRC diversity beyond binning CRC into 270 tradition al classifications . 271 .

On projecting single - 275 cell expression profiles on quadrants corresponding to each of the four CMS , we noted a lack of 276 separation of all cell phenotypes between CMS subtypes suggesting that CRC exists in a 277 transcriptomic continuum55. 278 279 To test continuous scores reproducibility, we analyzed four bulk transcriptomic datasets 280 separately; we found that transcriptional shifts were reproducible across datasets for all major cell 281 types (Supplementary Fig s. 8-11). The contin uous score s showed no relia classifying CRC into immune -stromal desert (CMS2/CMS3 ) subtypes 283 as proposed previously 20. Thus, confirming continuous scores rather than di screte subtypes may 284 improve classifying CRC tumors and may variability, tumor/TME-to- 285 tumor /TME and TME -to-TME Of note, CAF -S1 exhibited high PCSS1 and PCSS2 286 score s across independent datasets , correlat ing with t he CMS4 subtype. Thus, our analysis 287 identified CAF -S1 as a cell of origin for biological heterogeneity in CMS4 subtypes associated 288 with poor p rognosis (Supplem entary table 5 ). 289 290 DISCUSSION 291 In the present study, we evaluated the CMS classification of CRC that have been developed by 292 bulk RNA-seq through single-cell resolution transcriptomic analysis. We find that stromal cells 293 engender a more sign ificant contribution to biological heterogeneity . Although previous studies 294 employing bulk transcriptomics have demonstrated th at the degree of stromal infiltration is 295 associated with prognosis and a small scRNAseq study utilizing 26 fibroblasts demonstrat ed poor 296 CAF-enriched CRC tumors 297 .

Further , we 299 develop ed a novel signature of CAF infiltration and demonstrate that CMS4 can be stratifi ed into 300 risk group s associated with good or poor median overall survival . These findings are significant 301 since the CMS4 subtype, is primarily stromal-driven and is enriched in more than 40% of 302 metastatic CRC samples from patients with worse outcomes21. We also identified CAF-S1 303 subtypes associated with certain biological functions in other cancers , including the ecm-myCAF 304 and TGF -myCAF subtypes (responsible immunotherapy resistance in NSCLC and 305 melanoma), and CAF-S4s known to play a role in inducing cancer cell invasion48,49. Thus, 306 targeting CAFs to remodel the tumor microenvironment may lead to improved and much-needed 307 therapeutic development for metastatic CRC patients21,22. 308 309 Targeting of CAFs in solid tumors is being explored in multiple clinical trials with variable results60-310 62. Such studies likely failed to address CAF heterogeneity and their complex interactions with the 311 other cells of TME. Our study suggests that CRC may be intricately entwined with the stroma , 312 and therefore may be amenable to stromal targete d combinat oric approaches, including 313 monoclonal antibodies that abrogat e CAF-S1 function . In future studies, t he treatment of CRC 314 patients should involv e stroma targeted therapies and take the above aspects into 315 consideration60,63. The scRNA -seq or bulk -RNA -seq signature s corresponding to CAF -S1 and 316 CAF-S4 may serve as suitable biomarker s for tumors that are reliant on this axis. Immunoth erapy 317 responses in MSS CRC of lacking; CAF 318 subpopulations within the TME may be suppressing immune responses in these tumors 64. Based 319 on our analysis, we speculate that targeting CAF -derived chemokines and cytokines via 320 biospecific antibodies, vaccines , or even cell -based therapies, may enhance current checkpoint 321 blockade strategies60. Functional validation and clinical studies will be required to confirm the 322 clinical utility of targeting these CAF pop ulations in CRC. 323 .

Based on our findings, it appear s that bulk analysis may have been confounded by 327 varying tumor microenvironment population enrichment , and that tumor cells within each patient 328 do not segregate into static phenotypes but rather exhibit considerable plasticity. In contrast , the 329 single -cell analysis uncovered the complex and mixed cellular -phenotypes among each cell 330 specific subpopulation , which projected in a transcriptomic continuum across CMS subtypes . 331 These findings were further supported by scRNA -seq CMS classification analysis that ass igned 332 each CRC sample to multiple CMS subtypes thereby suggesting CMS heterogeneity in each CRC 333 tumor20,65. These findings may also explain why CMS -defined populations of tumors ha ve not 334 been readily observed in transcriptomic data from independent CRC cohorts21,53. Our data 335 indicate that attempts to divide CRC phenotypes into the current discrete subtypes may 336 undermine optimal patient stratification in the clinical trial setting . Intriguingly, by applying two 337 independent algorithms , we demonstrate that CRC tumors and their ecosystem s exist in a 338 transcriptomic continuum and not only show tumor -to-tumor variability (as proposed by Ma et al.) 339 but also demonstrate tumor/TME -to-tumor /TME transcriptional variabilit y at the single continuous scores are reproducible across transcriptomic datasets, thus 341 allowing robust identification of patient subtypes . This may help to optimiz e CRC treatment in 342 future stud ies. 343 344 In conclusion, our study lends strong support to the tumor biology models proposed by Ma et al. 345 (and other groups) and represent s a conceptual shift in our understanding of CRC pathogenesis, 346 clinical management, and therapeutic development. Future studies will need to consider tumor - 347 TME to tumor -TME heterogeneity which will be critical for optimizing biomarkers and treatment 348 strategies for CRC. 349 .

Patients with resectable untreated CRC who underwent 385 curative colon resection at Rush University Medical Center (Chicago , IL, USA ) were included in 386 this Inst itutional Review Board (IR B)-approved study. CRC specimens from 16 patients including 387 nine Caucasian, six African American and one Asian patient with corresponding 8 adjacent normal 388 tissue samples were processed immediately after collection at Rush University Medical Center 389 Biorepo sitory and sent for scRNA -seq. Thus, our scRNA -seq atlas repre sent diverse patient 390 population . The study was conducted in accordance with ethical standards and all patients 391 provided written informed consent. 392 393 Droplet based scRNA -seq - 10\u00d7 library using 10X Genomics Single Cell 5' Platform. Tumors 395 samples were enzymatically dissociated ( Miltenyi ), micron cell strainer, pelleted after cent rifugation at 300 x g and resuspended in DAPI -FACS buffer 397 (PBS, 0.04 % BSA). Samples were sorted and viable singlets were gated on the basis of scatter 398 properties and DAPI exclusion. Approximately 3000 cells were pelleted and resuspended in PBS , 399 and cells un derwent single cell droplet -based capture on 10X Chromium instruments according 400 to the 10X Genomics Single Cell 5' Platform protocol. Transcriptome libraries post-fragmentation, end-repair, and A -tailing double -sided size selection , and subsequent adaptor ligation also 402 followed the manufacturer's protocol. Illumina NextSeq 550 was used for library sequencing and 403 data were mapped and counted using Cellranger -v3.1.0 ( GRCh38/hg38 ). gene -expression quantification, dimensionali ty reduction , 406 and identification of cell clusters . Cell Ranger was utilized to process the raw gene expression 407 matrices per samples and all samples from multiple patients were combined in R package (v3.6.3 408 .

Genes detected in fewer than three cells and cells expressing less than 410 200 detected genes were filtered out and excluded f rom analysis . In addition, cells expressing > 411 25% mitochondria were removed. Cell cycle scoring was performed, (for the S phase and the 412 G2M phase ) and the predicted cell cycle phase s were calculated. Doublet detection and any 413 higher -order multiplets that were not dissociated during sample preparation were removed via 414 the DoubletFin der (v2.0.2) package using default settings67. Following quality control one n on- 415 malignant colon sample (B -cac13) was discarded due to poo r data quality. Finally, 49 ,859 cells 416 remained and were utilized for downstrea m analysis. 417 We adopted the general protocol described in Stuart et al. (2019) to group single cells into different 418 cell subsets66. We employed the following steps : clustering the cells with in each compartment 419 (including the selecti on of variable genes for each dataset based on a variance stabilizing 420 transformation [VST]), canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to remove batch effects among the 421 samples, reduction of dimensionality, and projecti on of cells onto graphs 68,69. Principal 422 component analysis (PCA) was carried out on the scaled data of highly varia ble genes70. The first 423 30 principal compon ents (PCs) were used to cluster the cells and to perform a subtype analysis 424 by nonlinear dimensionality reduction (t -SNE) and to construct Uniform Manifold Approximation 425 and Projection (UMAP) for cell embeddings71,72. We identified cell clusters under the optimal 426 resolution by a shared nearest neighbor (SNN) modularity optimization -based clustering method. 427 We implemented the FindClusters function of the Seurat package, which firs t calculated k-nearest 428 neighbo rs and constructed the SNN graph. We implemented the original Louvain algorithm 429 (algorithm = 1) for modularity optimization. Additionally, we utilized Clustree (v0.4.3) and manual 430 review for identifying the best clustering resolution24. 431 432 Major cell type detection and data visualization . To identify all major cell types, we evaluated 433 differentially expressed markers in each identity cell group by com paring them to other clusters 434 .

We used positively expressed genes with an average 435 expression of >/= 2 -fold higher in that subcluster than th e average expression in the rest of the 436 other subclusters. We used known ma rker genes, which have the highest fold expression in that 437 cluster with respect to the other clusters. We also utilized SingleR ((v0.99.10, R Package) , which 438 leverage large transcriptomic datasets of well -annotated cell types and manual annotation for 439 cell-type identification31,73 -75. Depending on the presence of known marker genes the clusters 440 were grouped as: epithelial 31,47,73,7 6-80. 443 The cells were eventually assembled into DGE matrices within each compartment, containing all 444 six cell types. 445 446 Major -cell type subclustering and data visualization . Each major cell type , including epithelial 447 cells, endothelial cells, T cells, B cells, myeloid cells, and fibroblasts was reclustered and 448 reanalyzed to study each compartment at a higher resolution to detect granular cellular 449 heterogeneity in CRC . Clustree (v0.4.3) and manual review were utilized for optimal cluster 450 detection. For cell an notation of each cell type , we utilized published literatur e gene expression 451 signatures and manual review of differential genes among clusters. Additionally, we again utilized 452 SingleR (v0.99.10, R Package) for unbiased cell annotation. Interestingly , reclu stering of major 453 compartments individually also detected clusters expressing hybrid markers as well as cell 454 clusters expressing markers from distinct lineage s (such as T cell clusters expressing B cells); 455 these were removed and excluded for further analys is. We u tilized UMAP for visualization 456 purposes. For validation, we analyzed 65,362 cells from 23 patients and applied the same quality 457 control me trics as outlined above , retain ing 31,383 high-quality single cells for further analysis29. 458 These high -quality cells were analyzed utilizing the same pipelines and parameters as that for our 459 primary cohort (Supplementary Figs. 4 -5 and 12-13). 460 .

Non -malignant epithelial cells were used as the control group. 463 464 Trajectory analysis . We used Monocle v.2 (v2.14.0), a reverse graph embedding method to 465 reconstruct si ngle-cell trajectories in tumor and non -malignant epithelium82. In brief, we used UMI 466 count matrices and the negbinomial.size () parameter to create a CellDataSet object in the default 467 setting. We grouped projected cells on UMAP in default settings for visuali zation of monocle 468 results. We defined the cumulative duration of the trajectory to show the average amount of 469 transcriptional transition that a cell undergoes as it passes from the starting state to the end state. 470 The cells were also ordered in pseu dotime to explain the transition of cells from one state to 471 another. 472 473 Pathway - Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) . Pathway analysis was performed on the 50 474 hallmark gene sets downloaded from Molecular Signatures Database (v7.2). We used GSVA 475 (v1.34.0), a non-parametric, unsupervised method to estimate the gene set variation s and 476 evaluation of pathway enrichment , and pathway scores were calculated for each cell using 477 standard settings 33,38. 478 479 DNA and bulk RNA library construction . DNA and bulk RNA sequencin g was performed as 480 previously described83. One hundred nanograms of DNA from each tumo r was mechanically 481 sheared to an average size of 200 bp. Using the KAPA Hyper Prep Pack , DNA libraries were 482 packed, hy bridized into the xT probe package, and amplified with KAPA HiFi HotStart 483 ReadyMix . For uniformity , each sample need ed to have 95% of all targeted base pairs sequenced 484 to a minimum depth of 300x. One hundred nanograms of RNA per tumor sample was heat 485 fragmented to a mean size of 200 base pairs in the presence of magnesium. Using random 486 .

After library 488 planning, the IDT xGEN Exome Test Panel was hybridized with samples. Streptavidin -coated 489 beads and target recove ry were carried out, accompanied by amplification using the KAPA HiFi 490 library amplification package. The RNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 using 491 patterned flow cell technology to achieve at least 50 million reads. 492 493 Detection of somatic varia tion on DNA sequencing data . The tumor and normal FASTQ files 494 were paired. For quality management measurement, FASTQ files we re evaluated using FASTQC 495 and matched with Novoalign (Novocraft, Inc.)83,84. SAM files were generated and converted to 496 BAM files. The BAM files were sorted, and duplicates were marked. Single nucleotide variations 497 (SNVs) were called after alignment and sorting. For discovery of copy number alterations, the de - 498 duplicated BAM files and the VCF generated from the variant calling pipeline were processed to 499 computat e read depth a nd variance of heterozygous germline SNVs between the tumor sample 500 and normal sample. Binary circular segmentation was introduced and segments with strongly 501 differential log 2 ratios between the tumor and its comparator were chosen. From a combination of 502 differential coverage in segmented regions and estimation of stromal admixture provided by 503 analysis of heterozygous germline SNVs, an estimated integer copy number was determined 504 505 Microsatellite instability status . Probes for 43 microsatellite regions were developed using 506 Tempus xT assay83. Tumors were categorized into three groups by the M SI classification 507 algorithm as described by Tempus: microsatellite instability -high (MSI -H), microsatellite stable 508 (MSS) o r microsatellite equivocal (MSE). MSI screening for paired tumor -normal patients used 509 reads mapped to the microsatellite loci with at least 5 bps flanking the microsatellite. The sample 510 was graded as MSI -H if there was a >70 % chance of MSI -H classification. If the likelihood of MSI - 511 H status was 30 -70%, the test findings were too ambiguous to interpret and those samples were 512 .

If there was a <30 % chance of MSI -H status, the sample was called MSS. 513 Additionally, IHC results were used to classify tumors into MSS or MSI molecular subtypes. Both 514 of these modalities were concordant and produced the same results. 515 516 Bulk RNA -seq and mi croarray analysis . We downloaded and pooled and 519 a non-small cell lung cancer dataset (GSE3353292) to validate our findings from the single cell 520 compartments by deconvoluting the bulk gene ex pression profile s into pseudo single -cell 521 resolution s. We used Affy (v1.64.0) for the data analysis and for exploration of Affymetrix 522 oligonucleotide array probe level data93. Batch correction was carried out using the 523 removeBatchEffect (v3. 42.2) function of the LIMMA program and CMScaller for the CMS 524 classification (see below)94. Three datasets ( GSE1753687, GSE3311389, and GSE3958214) were 525 utilized for clinical outcome analysis94,95. 526 527 Correlation patterns in bulk gene expressions for CAF compartments . To identify the top 528 correlated CAF -marker genes within the combined eight CRC datasets, four bulk CRC gene 529 expression sets individually , pancreas cancer and lung cancer datasets. We first transformed the 530 bulk gene expression sets with log 2 transformation . Next, m arker genes with an average log 2 531 FC>/= 0.5 and p<0.05 obta ined from the single cell data of CAF -S1 an d CAF -S4 compartments 532 were separately intersected with the bulk gene expression sets. Genes with an average 533 Spearman correlation score greater than 0.8 were kept as the CAF signatures within the bulk 534 gene express ion. Heatmaps illustrating the correlation patterns within and between the CAF 535 compartments were prepared with the heatmap.2 function from ggplot package (v3.1.1) utilizing 536 the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Each cell type's marker genes with an average 542 logFC>1 and adjusted P<0.05 were intersected with the bulk expression datasets separately. We 543 only kept the marker genes with a high corr elation with each other in bulk, which provides an 544 average correlation score of > 0.8. The average bulk expression of each cell type's remaining 545 marker genes was calculated and used in the hazard regression model as the representative of 546 this cell type. Fo r analysis of relationships with patient outcome, univariate models were 547 calculated using Cox proportional hazard regression (coxph function from survival R package )97. 548 549 Deconvoluting publi c bulk gene expression profiles into pseudo single -cell expressions . 550 We used CIBERSORTx v1 to estimate composition of various cell populations in pooled eight 551 microarray datasets52. Signature gene matrices were created using the expression profiles of 552 49,859 cells as the refere nce single cell profile. We ran the 'hires' module with default parameters 553 except for the 'rmbatchBmode ,' and the bulk -mode batch correction argument was set to true. 554 After the deconvolution process, we no rmalized the gene expressions according to the cell 555 fractions in each sample and calculated each gene's Z -transformed expression values. The 556 average normalized expression of each cell type across all samples was plotted with the 557 heatmap.3 R function of the GMD package (v0.3.3)98. A signature matrix highlighting marker 558 genes of the different cell types was prepared with a heatmap.2 R function of ggplot (v3.1.1) .

We used R 563 package CMScaller (v0.9.2), a nearest template prediction (NTP) algorithm, for the classification 564 of gene expression datasets95. We set the permutation number to 1000 to predict the CMS classes 565 of the samples in the GEO datasets with a p-value < 0.05. We ran CMScaller with default 566 parameters . 567 568 Continuous subtype discovery using scRNA -seq analysis . Bulk mRNA expression profiles of 569 the combined and batch adjusted eight GEO datasets 1584 571 samples in total, were deconvoluted into the pseudo single -cell expression profiles via 572 CIBERSORT x utilizing the expression data consisting of 2 o different cell types from our scRNA - 573 seq data set52. We transformed the deconvoluted expression matrix with log2 transformation. The 574 principal components cluster subtype scores (PCSSs) of the CMS subtypes among the 1584 575 sampl es, were determined separately for each cell type using an algorithm published by Ma et 576 al55. To obtain the PCSSs, the average loading vect ors were used. The results obtained for 2 0 577 cell types were projected on the first two PCSSs (PCSS1 and PCSS2) as they were validated by 578 Ma et al. in their analysis using 18 datasets. We also analyzed four datasets ( GSE1433386, 579 GSE1753687, GSE3311389, and GSE3958214) to independently confirm reproducibility of 580 continuous scores. 581 582 Statistics and reproducibility . All statistical analyses and graphs were created in R (v3.6.3) and 583 using a Python -based computational analysis tool. Schematic representations were made usi ng 584 the Inkscape (https://inkscape.org/) software . Dim plots, bar plots and box plots were generated 585 using the dittoSeq (v1.1.7 ) package with default parameters99. Violin plots were generated using 586 the patchwork (v1.1.0) package and ggplot 2 (v3.3.2 ) package in R with default parameters . 587 Heatmaps were generated using Morpheus.R with and pair - 588 .

The Box and Whisker plots were generated using the 590 boxplot function of the R base package at default parameters . The mean of the log 2 transformed 591 deconvoluted expression value of the samples in each CMS group was demonstrated with a 592 horizontal straight line within each box. The l ength of a boxplot corresponds to the interquartile 593 range (IQR), which is defined as the range between the first and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3), 594 whereas the whiskers are the upper and lower extreme values o f the data (either data's extre mum 595 values, or the Q3+1.5*IQR and Q1 -1.5*IQR values, whichever was less extreme). 596 597 Survival analysis . Survival curves were obtained according to the Kaplan -Meier method survfit 598 (v3.2 -7), and differences between survival dist ributions were assessed by Log -rank test. The 599 patients were divided into two groups (high/poor and low /good risk) according to their median 600 expression values (survminer (v0.4.8 )). The surv_cutpoint function uses the maximally selected 601 rank statistics and i mplements standard methods for the approximation of the null distribution of 602 maximally selected rank statistics (maxstat (v0.7 -25). 603 604 The proportional hazard assumption was tested to examine the fit of the model for survival of the 605 samples in four GEO datas ets (GSE1433386, GSE1753687, GSE3311389, and GSE3958214) with 606 respect to the deconvoluted bulk mRNA expressions.
