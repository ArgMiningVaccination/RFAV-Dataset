The report aims to provide unbiasedinformation about the international patent regime, the current patent status of certainHIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa and opportunities that exist throughflexibility in international patent law that may help to improve access to HIV/AIDSdrugs in that region. The report concludes that providing state-of-the-art HIV/AIDS therapies to patients in poor countries requires two kinds of subsidies. The first is the indirect subsidywhich consumers in developed countries pay in the form of higher prices forpatented drugs. The patent incentive in countries such as the United States inducesthe free market to test and develop new products. Without the patent incentive, life-sustaining AIDS therapies would simply be unavailable even to the wealthiestconsumers. The second kind of subsidy is direct funding of the treatmentinfrastructure and the purchase of drugs for patients in poor countries by thegovernments of developed countries acting in concert with one another throughinternational programs such as UNAIDS. It is unfortunate that the debate over patent protection has obscured the fact that current levels of foreign assistance - such as the USD 300 million proposed by theClinton Administration for Fiscal Year 2001 - are not even remotely adequate tosupport these infrastructure and drug purchase costs. This is true under any scenario,whether it is the manufacture and use of generic pharmaceuticals or the use of deeplydiscounted drugs made available under license from patent holders. In effect, theinadequate financial commitment by the United States and other wealthy countriesguarantees that many millions of infected Africans will not receive life-sustainingtreatments now taken for granted in the developed world, and that these men, womenand children will die when they might otherwise live. In January of 1999, when the International Intellectual Property Institute (IIPI) was founded, IIPI proposed a pilot project to deliver patented therapies and othertreatments to HIV/AIDS patients in developing countries based on a tiered pricingmodel. The project contemplated an integration of policy and technical approachesto expand access to HIV/AIDS drugs. The policy approach included principles oftiered pricing, together with national exhaustion and subsidized pharmaceuticalpurchases. The technical approach was based on sophisticated information systems,established models of patient care and controlled pharmaceutical delivery.Developments since this project was conceived have demonstrated the viability ofthese approaches, as well as the need for greatly expanded financing for them tosucceed. It has become abundantly clear that whether the purchase of generic orpatented drugs is contemplated, financing is critical. Due in no small measure to the efforts of NGOs and health activists, the issue of access to affordable drugs has been placed at the forefront of the agenda in battling2HIV/AIDS. The 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa in July 2000 focused the world's attention on the health crisis in Africa and the urgentneed to improve access to drugs. Governments, industry and activists have beengrappling with the issues that affect access to life-saving medicines, and areattempting to find solutions to these problems. Governments are seeking to find theappropriate balance between encouraging innovation in the pharmaceutical sectorthrough intellectual property protection and making life-saving drugs more widelyavailable. The United States, the European Union and Japan, home to the bulk of the research- based pharmaceutical industry, have endorsed, in several multilateral settings, theneed to find solutions to the problem of access to medicines for the developingworld. They recognize that encouraging innovation in the pharmaceutical sectorthrough the patent system must be balanced with the urgent need to make life-savingmedicines more widely available. In a somewhat dramatic policy shift, both theUnited States and the European Union during the past year have softened theiropposition to compulsory licensing and parallel importation of patented drugs. Inaddition, they have endorsed expanded mandates for the World Health Organizationto provide advice to countries on intellectual property matters and to makepharmaceutical pricing information more transparent. There appears to be anemerging trend in favor of exploring all possible solutions to the problem ofaffordable access to HIV/AIDS drugs. This report seeks to determine the extent to which patents for pharmaceuticals pose an impediment to the access of HIV/AIDS drugs in sub-Saharan Africa. The issue ofaccess to affordable drugs involves numerous and complex issues, including healthcare infrastructure, international pricing mechanisms, financing, debt, tariffs andpatents. Even without patents or the WTO requirements under the TRIPS Agreement, HIV/AIDS drugs are, for the reasons set out above, beyond the reach of people inneed. In some countries, even the basic medicines needed for treating non-HIVailments are not affordable or available. Clearly, efforts to enhance access toHIV/AIDS drugs will require much more than merely looking at the patent issue.Nevertheless, patent issues and intellectual property rights cannot be ignored in thedebate and must be addressed. It is our hope that this report will elucidate the issuessurrounding the international debate concerning the role that intellectual propertystandards and patents play regarding access to HIV/AIDS drugs. Chapter 1 of this report outlines the magnitude of the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub- Saharan Africa, and reviews the response of the international community, includingthe growing chorus calling for enhanced access to affordable drugs. Chapter 2reviews the international patent regime established under the WTO TRIPSAgreement and in particular focuses on those provisions relevant to the issue ofpharmaceuticals. Chapter 3 looks at the patent situation in sub-Saharan Africa, andparticularly at the situation with regard to the protection of anti-retroviral HIV/AIDSdrugs in the region. The results of IIPI surveys of patent offices and pharmaceutical3companies are also presented in Chapter 3. Following this analysis, conclusions are presented in Chapter 4, and recommendations, including specific recommendationsdirected to the World Intellectual Property Organization, are presented in Chapter 5.The report also includes country profiles that provide basic relevant information foreach sub-Saharan country in continental Africa in Chapter 6, and concludes with aglossary of terms for reference. Perhaps the most important conclusion of this report is that the TRIPS Agreement is not an impediment to the distribution of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals. It does not yetapply to the majority of sub-Saharan African countries, and where it does, it permitssufficient flexibility for countries to avoid negative effects. Similarly, patents arenot an issue in access to drugs in sub-Saharan African countries, since most drugcompanies have not obtained patents widely in Africa. The real issue, this paperconcludes, is that of adequate financing of the overall health system and thedevelopment of health care infrastructures. It is for this reason that the primary recommendation of this report is that WIPO undertake efforts to correct perceptions that may lead to the conclusion thatintellectual property protections in some way contribute to the lack of distribution ofHIV/AIDS drugs and that it become a more active player in international debates onthe subject. The report also recommends that WIPO strengthen its collaboration withthe organizations involved in this area. The International Intellectual Property Institute hopes that this report will help to enlighten these international debates on access to affordable drugs and encouragefurther research into the role that patents and the TRIPS Agreement play, or do notplay, in this regard.

Since the epidemic began, some 15 million Africans have died from AIDS and there are nearly 25million adults and children living with HIV/AIDS in African countries south of theSahara Desert. 1 There were 4.0 million new infections in this region during 1999. There are now 16 countries in which more than one-tenth of the adult population isinfected with HIV. In seven countries at the southern cone of the continent, theinfection rate exceeds 20 percent. 2 Estimates of adult infection rates for the countries hardest hit by the HIV/AIDSepidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, as of the end of 1999, are shown below: BOTSWANA 35.80% KENYA MALAWI 15.96% ETHIOPIA 10.63% The HIV/AIDS epidemic poses an enormous threat to development in sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for more than 70 percent of all HIV/AIDS cases globally.HIV/AIDS has reversed social, economic and political gains made over the past threedecades in several countries. 3 As starkly put by the International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa, \"[t]he speed, spread and scope of the epidemic is unprecedented inmodern times...By threatening a generation of youthful, productive people, thedisease is mortgaging the continent's future.\" 4 The devastating effects of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, predicted since the early 1990s, is now being seen in fallinglife expectancies, increasing numbers of orphans, and terrible tolls on households,learning, teaching, health systems, agriculture and business sectors across the board. 5 The Worldwatch Institute, a nonprofit public policy research organization dedicatedto informing policymakers and the public about emerging global problems andtrends, recently published an \"Issue Alert\" noting the precipitous fall in life 1 World Bank Press Release, \"World Bank Steps Up Fight Against AIDS in Africa\", 14 September 2000. 2 Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic, UNAIDS/00.13E (English original, June 2000) (ISBN: 92-9173-000-9), 3 UNAIDS Press Release, \"UNAIDS Calls on G8 for Massive Increase in Resources to Fight AIDS\", Geneva, July 20, 2000 (at www.unaids.org/whatsnews/press/eng/geneva200700.html ). 4 \"AIDS in Africa: Development in Crisis\", The International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa, UNAIDS/00.11E, May 2000, p. 2. 5 Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic, pp. 21-36.5expectancies in sub-Saharan Africa.6 Without AIDS, life expectancy in the year 2010 in Zimbabwe would be 70 years, in Botswana 66 years and in Zambia 60 years.With AIDS, these life expectancies are expected to drop to 35 years in Zimbabwe, 33years in Botswana and 30 years in Zambia, \"more akin to those of the Middle Agesthan of the modern age.\" By 2010, Africa is expected to have 40 million orphans. 7 About 95 percent of HIV-infected people live in developing countries, most of themin sub-Saharan Africa. At the same time, African governments together owe morethan USD 230 billion in debt, with repayments costing Africa USD 15 billion eachyear - the equivalent of 5 percent of the region's income and about 15 percent of itsexport earnings. 8 Despite concerted and intensified efforts to address the HIV/AIDS crisis, however,the epidemic rages on in several sub-Saharan African countries with moredevastation than even the worst estimates predicted. In 1991, it was estimated that 9million people would be infected and 5 million would die from HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa by the end of the decade, whereas in reality the figures are almosttriple those predicted: 24 million infected and 13.7 million dead. 9 6 \"HIV Epidemic Restructuring Africa's Population\", Lester R.

Key players include: UNAIDS , the leading advocate for global action on HIV/AIDS formed in 1995, which brings together seven UN agencies in a common effort to fight the epidemic:the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), theUN Population Fund (UNFPA), the UN International Drug Control Programme(UNDCP), the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), theWorld Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank; The International Partnership Against AIDS in Africa , a coalition uniting, under the leadership of African governments, the United Nations system of organizations,including UNAIDS, donor governments, and the private and community sectors; The World Bank and International Monetary Fund , which launched the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) in 1996 and enhanced it at their jointmeeting in September 1999 to accelerate debt relief of the poorest countries withunsustainable levels of debt; The World Bank's multi-sectoral AIDS Campaign Team for Africa (ACTafrica ) supports Bank country teams to: mobilize African leaders, civil society and theprivate sector to intensify action against HIV/AIDS; to retrofit Bank projects withHIV/AIDS components where possible; to assist with the development of newprojects; and strengthens the Bank's partnership with UNAIDS and other keyagencies, NGOs and other partners; The U.S. Export-Import Bank , which, in 1999 financed USD 17 billion of exports to hospitals and for medical equipment and pharmaceuticals. Since an assessment ofthe enormity of the problem, following the AIDS Durban Conference of July 2000,the Bank offered USD 1 billion a year in financing to the sub-Saharan region to builda sustainable, effective infrastructure of health care. The NGO Sector , including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), Consumers International (CI), Consumer Project on Technology (CPT), Health ActionInternational (HAI), Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD), Act Up,International Council of AIDS Service Organizations (ICASO), Critical Path AIDSProject, International AIDS Economic Network (IAEN), Health Gap Coalition,Family Health International, Oxfam and countless other AIDS service andcommunity organizations and coalitions; Pharmaceutical companies , who have introduced life-saving therapies to treat HIV/AIDS and its associated opportunistic infections, and who have entered into7preferential pricing arrangements with several countries and organizations and established various drug donation programs; and Governments , who through the United Nations and other international organizations have focused worldwide attention on the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. Since 1987, the WHO has provided financial support and technical guidance for AIDS activities in more than 150 developing countries around the world. On 31December 1995 the program was reformed as UNAIDS. To ensure the continuity ofits response to HIV/AIDS global needs, WHO established the office of HIV/AIDSand Sexually Transmitted Diseases (ASD). ASD functions to assist UNAIDS inachieving its goals. 10 In recent years, a series of high-level meetings have focused on the fight againstpoverty and communicable diseases, including the G8 (Birmingham 1998, Cologne1999, 2000), the EU-US Summit (Queluz 2000), the EU-Africa Summit(Cairo 2000), the African Heads of State meeting (Abuja, March 20000), and theSocial Summit in Geneva (June 20000. Each of these meetings has called forinternational partnerships to take intensified action to address poverty andcommunicable disease, including HIV. The United Nations Security Council, under the presidency of the United States in January 2000, also focused on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa, marking the firsttime that the Security Council has taken up a development issue. The United Statesrecognized that HIV/AIDS had grown beyond a health or social question to becomea threat to global security and stability. On 3 November 2000, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to convene a special session of the General Assembly from 25-27 June 2001 to address theproblem of HIV/AIDS and to secure a global commitment to combat the epidemic.The special session will focus on HIV/AIDS in Africa, international funding andcooperation, prevention, access to care and treatment and other issues. It requestedthe Secretary-General to present a comprehensive report describing, among otherthings, the status and level of national, regional and international response andcooperation. 11 According to the Panos Institute, a leading international authority on HIV/AIDS, twoprimary factors prevent widespread access to treatment for AIDS in the developingworld: inadequate health services and lack of drugs. 12 Poor infrastructure in those countries hardest hit by the AIDS epidemic is evidenced by inadequate healthfacilities, lack of hospital beds and laboratories, lack of trained medical andlaboratory staff and non-existent or incomplete drug distribution systems.

The Cost of Treating HIV/AIDS in the Developing World\", Martin Foreman, The Panos Institute (London, 2000) at p. 13 (at www.panos.org.uk) .8Institute notes that in Western Europe and North America, public health expenditures upwards of USD 1,500 per person annually are the norm, whereas in Africa suchexpenditure is frequently under USD 20 per person. 13 Furthermore, 50 percent of the population in sub-Saharan Africa does not have access to clean water, and 48percent of children under the age of five are under-nourished. 14 Compounding the problems, according to Panos, is the fact that: \"[i]n many parts of the developing world, poor administration, lack of funds, cash flow problems and corruption can all prevent even thecheapest treatments from reaching hospitals and patients.\" 15 Debt Relief An effort to reduce the debt of the poorest countries, the \"Highly-Indebted Poor Countries Initiative\" (HIPC) launched by the World Bank and InternationalMonetary Fund in 1996, was widely criticized as a failure. 16 In 1999, the lending institutions launched a major expansion of the lending initiative, the HIPC II.According to the World Bank, 11 countries (mostly in Africa) are now receivingrelief that will amount to some USD 191 billion over time, and work is progressingto meet the target of debt forgiveness for 20 countries by the end of 2000. The newinitiative, the World Bank claims, includes more than twice the relief provided underthe original framework, and will cut by more than two-thirds the outstanding debt tomore than 30 countries. 17 Critics, however, say that the debt-relief program provides too little relief too late, and will leave the countries as heavily indebted in the end.18 Debt relief is important for the reasons more fully set out in the conclusion to thisreport, which deals in part with financial assistance. 13 Ibid. 14 Ibid. 15 Ibid. at p. 16. 16 \"Health Care and the Developing World\", Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, 2000 (at www.phrma.org/publications). 17 \"The HIPC Initiative: Background and Progress Through October 2000\", World Bank, 2000 (at www.worldbank.org/hipc) . 18 \"Lenders to Speed Up Debt Relief\", Mark Drajem, The Washington Post , 11 November 2000.91.2 Focus on Access to Drugs There are currently three types of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS: nucleosidereverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., AZT, and nelfinavir). The ideal treatmentstrategy in developed countries involves the use of at least three of these drugs incombination, in a so-called \"cocktail\" of drugs, that includes a protease inhibitor ornon-nucleoside transcriptase inhibitor. Since FDA approval of the firstprotease inhibitor in 1996, use of the ARV drug cocktail in developed countries hasbrought impressive results. Mortality rates from HIV/AIDS have been reduced by75 percent over three years, for example, in the United States. 19 Despite the remarkable results achieved by the use of these drugs in developedcountries, the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals live in developing countriesand do not have access to them. Several factors contribute to the lack of access toaffordable medicines in sub-Saharan Africa, including infrastructure problems(logistical supply and storage problems); ability to administer and monitor complexand potentially toxic drug regimens, including laboratory testing, patient follow-upand treatment of drug side effects; financing and affordability. According to the World Health Organization:- 50 percent of the population in developing countries lack access to essential drugs; - 50-90 percent of drugs in developing and transitional economies are paid for out-of-pocket, placing the heaviest burden on the poor; - Up to 75 percent of antibiotics are prescribed inappropriately, even in teaching hospitals in developing countries; - The worldwide average of patients who take their medicines correctly is 50 percent; - Antimicrobial resistance is growing for most major infectious diseases;- Less than one in three developing countries have fully functioning drug regulatory authorities; and - 10-20 percent of sampled drugs fail quality control tests in many developing countries, often resulting in toxic, sometimes lethal products. 20 19 \"Progress and Problems in the Fight Against AIDS\", B. Hirschel and P. Francioli, New England Journal of Medicine 338(13) (1998), pp. 906-908. 20 WHO Essential Drugs and Medicines Policy (at www.who.int/medicines ).10The international community has addressed the issue of access to affordable medicines in numerous settings. In April of 1999, The UN Commission on Human Rights urged member states to promote \"improved access to high-quality goods and services for preventingtransmission of the virus, and promote effective programs for the care and support ofpersons infected and affected by HIV, including through improved and equitable access to safe and effective medication for the treatment of HIV infection and HIV/AIDS-related illnesses.\" (our emphasis) 21 On 24 May 1999 the World Health Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on Revised Drug Strategy22, which requested the WHO to intensify its activities in six areas: national drug policies, pharmaceuticals and trade agreements, druginformation and drug promotion, drug quality, drug donations and partnerships. Theresolution urges countries to ensure that health interests are paramount in thepharmaceutical and health policies. In the area of pharmaceuticals and tradeagreements, the resolution strengthens the WHO's mandate to study the effects ofinternational trade agreements on health, and to advise member countries oninternational trade issues within the framework of national drug policies andregulatory measures. The resolution urged states to \"explore and review theiroptions under international agreements, including trade agreements, to safeguardaccess to essential drugs.\" 23 The WHO had already published information for countries that are reviewing their patent legislation under an earlier mandate from1996. 24 At the Third WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle from 30 November through 3December, 1999, the UNAIDS Secretariat issued a statement supporting the following: preferential pricing of HIV/AIDS drugs so that they are priced affordablyat levels consistent with local purchasing power; reduction or elimination of importduties, customs and taxes on HIV/AIDS pharmaceutical products; measures topromote generic competition and the \"early working\" of patented drugs so thatgeneric drugs can be made available more rapidly; and recourse to compulsorylicensing permitted under the TRIPS Agreement in countries where HIV/AIDSconstitutes a national emergency. 25 This statement also expressed support for patent protection as an incentive for innovative R&D of new HIV/AIDS drugs and,hopefully, HIV vaccines, but noted that intellectual property rights must be 21 Commission on Human Rights, Fifty-fifth session, April 21, 1999, E/CN.4/1999/L.72, p.4, para 4. 22 World Health Assembly, Resolution EB103/1999/R1, Revised Drug Strategy, May 24, 1999. 23 Ibid. 24 \"Globalization and Access to Drugs: Perspectives on the WTO/TRIPS Agreement, Health Economics and Drugs DAP series No. 7 Revised, World Health Organization, Geneva, 1999, waspublished to partially respond to the resolution adopted in May 1996 by the 49 th World Health Assembly that requested the WHO Director General to \"report on the impact of the work of the WTO with respect to national drug policies and essential drugs.\" 25 Statement of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) at the Third WTO Ministerial Conference, Seattle, 30 November - 3 December 1999, p. 2.11considered in the context of other social interests, such as the human rights concerning health and the benefits of scientific progress and its applications.26 In November 1997 UNAIDS initiated the pilot phase of its HIV Drug Access (DAI)to see if it could, working in conjunction with drug companies and four developingcountry governments, enable those countries to treat a greater number of their HIV-infected people. The African countries selected were Uganda and Ivory Coast,which are currently treating about 900 and 600 patients, respectively.Pharmaceutical partners included Bristol-Myers Squibb, DuPont, Glaxo Wellcome,Hoffmann-LaRoche, Merck, Organon Teknika and Virco. Each country establisheda national HIV drug policy oversight committee and a variety of programs to educatehealth care workers and patients about treatment and to provide ancillary care. According to the UNAIDS evaluation of the DAI, among the lessons learned from the program were: \"The DAI has demonstrated that rational use of antiretrovirals is feasible in developing countries within an institutional frameworkthat may be accommodated according to the specificities of thecountry...The DAI clearly increased capacity in the area of care andsupport for PLWAs (People Living with AIDS) in the four countries. There is an increased knowledge of the use of antiretrovirals by thehealth care workers as well as a successful transfer of know-how fora comprehensive follow-up of those PLWAs on antiretroviral therapy.There is also an improvement in the distribution and stockmanagement of drugs, the regulation of supply and the ability toregulate the market...In the fields of price reduction of drugs, theInitiative has been a continuing learning experience. This has finallyled to a mixed model of price reduction mechanism combiningnegotiations and competition, which appears as a model that canwork in several countries. The DAI clearly shows that opencompetition including generics is an element of price reduction\" 27. In stating what should be reinforced or done differently, UNAIDS says it should, among other things, do the following: \"(a) Strengthen the 'hook' effect of antiretrovirals for wider access to care in general; Until mid 1999, the DAI focused almostexclusively on making antiretrovirals available, and insufficientlyemphasized performance in voluntary counseling and testing,psychosocial support, management of opportunistic infections andpalliative [pain-relieving] care. 28 26 Id at p.2, citing the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Articles 12 and 15. 27 UNAIDS Best Practice Digest, \"UNAIDS HIV Drug Access Initiative: Pilot Phase\", May 2000 (available at www.unaids.org/bestpractice/digest/files/drugaccess.html ) 28 Ibid.12In its June 2000 Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic, UNAIDS noted that: \"Making drugs more accessible requires a broad look at the underlying reasons for poor access. One factor is the cost of drugs.Another is inadequate information about the drugs needed to manageHIV-related illnesses. Finally, drug access is hampered by the poorcapacity of health systems in developing countries to select and usedrugs in a rational manner, to monitor patients' progress and sideeffects, and to manage their drug supply. This is linked in turn toinadequate financing of the health system in general and of the drugsupply in particular.\" \"In the current context, attention has mainly focused on drug prices, and in particular the price of antiretroviral drugs still under patent inhigh-income countries, which makes them financially inaccessible tomost people with HIV. However, for reasons mentioned above,people with HIV also have inadequate access to the \"essential drugs\"for treating HIV-related illness, including drugs that are no longerunder patent. The poor availability of drugs for pain relief orrespirator distress and for treatment of many HIV-related diseasesfound in a survey of university teaching hospitals shows howinadequate this access is, even at the highest echelon of the healthsystem.\" 29 In its June 2000 Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic, UNAIDS outlines stepsbeing taken to address the broad issue of access to drugs: \"Through collaboration between the UNAIDS Secretariat, WHO and UNICEF, some of the obstacles to essential drug access are beingtackled. First, beginning in 1997, 15 new drugs of interest to peoplewith HIV were included in the WHO Model List of Essential Drugs.The next step was to pinpoint the reason why most wholesalers ofgeneric drugs were not distributing the newly included drugs, andwhy even several important older drugs were rarely on offer.Working with WHO and UNICEF, the Secretariat identified themanufacturers and prices of 44 essential drugs whose procurementwas being hampered by insufficient information on cost andavailability. This information has been posted on the UNAIDS,UNICEF and WHO websites along with an offer to assist countries inlocating generic drug suppliers and organizing drug procurement.\" 30 29 Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic at p. 99. 30 Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic at p. 99-100.13More recently, UNAIDS, together with UNICEF, WHO, UNFPA and the World Bank have been inviting expressions of interest from manufacturers of antiretroviralHIV/AIDS drugs, among other drugs, that are committed to providing the products atpreferential prices to developing countries. 31 These UN programs and agencies are interested in promoting cooperation with interested parties who will: - accelerate sustained access to and use of good quality interventions for the treatment of HIV/AIDS-related illnesses and the prevention ofmother-to-child transmission of HIV; - ensure that care and treatment reach significantly greater numbers of people in need; and - implement programs in ways that respond to the specific needs and requests of individual countries. In evaluating the expressions of interest, due by 1 December 2000, only those manufacturers \"that can supply appropriate products of assured quality andcompliance with applicable regulatory and intellectual property laws will beconsidered.\" 32 The question of intellectual property rights and its relation to access to medicines,then, is a crucial part of the picture in efforts to enhance access to essentialmedicines. 31 \"WHO Expression of Interest\" at www.who.int/home/unaids/expression_of_interest.html . 32 Ibid.141.3 Change in U.S. and EU Patent Policies In conjunction with the focus on the cost of HIV/AIDS drugs, there has been a heightened awareness of the role that patents play in driving up drug prices. AIDSand health activists contend that patents and the TRIPS Agreement have the effect ofdenying access to HIV/AIDS drugs. The drug companies contend that patentprotection is essential to provide a return on their R&D investment and to encouragethe development of new drugs. In furtherance of this view, drug companies havefiercely defended their patent rights and generally opposed any efforts bygovernments to permit parallel imports or issue compulsory licenses. Until recently, the pharmaceutical industry was supported in its efforts by the U.S. government, which had consistently opposed compulsory licensing and parallelimportation of drugs under patent in other countries. The U.S. government viewedcompulsory licensing as a threat to patent incentives that encourage innovation and itviewed parallel importation as a threat to the cost structures adopted by thepharmaceutical industry. The European Union had expressed similar views. The U.S. government pressured South Africa and Thailand not to permit compulsory licensing or parallel imports. In the case of South Africa, one of the few sub-SaharanAfrican countries where pharmaceutical companies have patents in force, thegovernment had passed the Medicines and Related Substances Control Act, Act No. 90 of 1997 (\"the Act\") which allowed parallel imports (section 15C) and local South African companies to produce HIV/AIDS drugs under compulsory license (Section22C). Section 15C of the Act provides: \"The Minister [of Health] may prescribe conditions for the supply of more affordable medicines in certain circumstancesso as to protect the health of the public, and in particular may-... (b) prescribe the conditions on which any medicine which is identical in composition, meets the same quality standard and isintended to have the same proprietary name as that of anothermedicine already registered in the Republic [of South Africa], butwhich is imported by a person other than the person who is the holderof the registration certificate of the medicine already registered andwhich originates from any site of manufacture of the originalmanufacturer as approved by the council in the prescribed mannermay be imported.\" Section 22C provides in part: \"(1) Subject to the provisions of this section -15(b) the council may, on application in the prescribed manner and on payment of the prescribed fee, issue to a manufacturer, wholesaler ordistributor of a medicine or medical device a license to manufactureor act as a wholesaler of or distribute, as the case may be, suchmedicine or medical device, upon such conditions as to theapplication of such acceptable quality assurance principles and goodmanufacturing and distribution practices as the council maydetermine.\" As a result of the Act and what was perceived as a threat to international patent laws, South Africa was placed on the \"watch list\" under \"Special 301\" of the U.S. tradelaws on 30 April 1999. 33 The South African government argued that the WTO TRIPS Agreement expressly permits the granting of compulsory licensing andparallel importation. Nevertheless, the U.S. government pressured the SouthAfricans to repeal the Act. The argument, on the part of the South African Government, that the Act does not contravene the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement, has not yet been settled in law. 34 It is necessary, however, to discuss some aspects of the debate here since it toucheson the view expressed in this paper, that the TRIPS Agreement is in fact flexible.Whether or not it can be successfully argued that Article 8 and Article 73 allow agovernment to flout the provisions of TRIPS when adopting measures that inter alia have the effect of protecting public health and taking action necessary for theprotection of its essential security interests has not been decided. Article 8specifically provides that such measures should be consistent with TRIPS. Therelevant sections of the Act, if ever examined in a court of law, may or may notprove to be consistent with TRIPS. It has not been necessary to test the view taken by the South African government, however, since a softening of the U.S. position emerged, apparently resulting fromgrowing pressure from activists both in the United States and South Africa. Interesting to note, however, is that the South African patent law has always provided for compulsory licensing and that prior to the enactment of the Medicinesand Related Substances Control Act, the Patents Act was not attacked on this basis. 35 33 The \"Special 301\" provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, require the USTR to identify foreign countries that deny adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights or fair andequitable market access for U.S. persons that rely on intellectual property protection. Special 301 was amended in the Uruguay Round Agreements Act to clarify that a country can be found to deny adequate and effective intellectual property protection even if it is in compliance with its obligationsunder the TRIPS Agreement. 34 A case brought against the South African Government on the basis of its enactment of the Medicines and Related Substances Control Act, 90 of 1997 by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association of South Africa has been settled, without a judgment finding for or against the government's view. 35 The Patents Act, No 57 of 1978 (as amended) provides for compulsory licensing in cases of abuse of patent rights and for dependent patents. Patent rights are deemed abused, are among other things16Coalitions of organizations including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, Consumers International, Consumer Project on Technology, Health Action International,Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD) and Act Up! engaged in campaigns inboth the United States and South Africa against the pressure being brought to bear onthe South African government. The Congressional Black Caucus in the UnitedStates also pushed legislation that would prevent the United States from continuingto pressure the South African government. Chronologies of these activities can befound on the web sites of these organizations at ( www.msf.org , www.cpt.org , etc.). On 17 September 1999, officials of the United States and South Africa reached a common understanding on the issue of intellectual property rights as they pertain tothe pharmaceutical industry. The understanding was premised on the commitment ofboth governments to the TRIPS Agreement, as well as an appreciation of the SouthAfrican government's efforts to provide affordable health care to its people in anational emergency. This understanding recognized that the TRIPS Agreement wasdesigned to ensure high levels of intellectual property protection while enablinggovernments to address national social needs. This sentiment is enshrined in Articles31 and 6 of the TRIPS Agreement, discussed more fully below. The U.S. policy shift, i.e. that South Africa was in contravention of the TRIPS Agreement and should thus be sanctioned, was more broadly made known at theThird Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization in Seattle inDecember 1999. President Clinton announced at the meeting that the United Stateswas committed to helping developing countries gain access to affordable medicines,including those for HIV/AIDS, and that, as a result, the United States would ensurethe application of U.S. trade law related to intellectual property remain sufficientlyflexible to respond to public health crises. Vice President Gore reiterated thismessage in his January 2000 speech at the United Nations Security Council. In response to a reporter's question at a press briefing in Seattle, Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. Trade Representative, explained the policy: The President, [as you know, in his speech yesterday] did announce that the protection of intellectual property rights is obviously criticaland is the foundation of a modern economy. He also said, however,that in the case of a health crisis, particularly the issue of HIV-AIDS,that U.S. intellectual property rights policy, while consistent with theintellectual property agreements of the WTO, would be administeredin a manner flexible enough to ensure affordable medicines for thepoorest countries where the invention is not being worked in South Africa on a commercial scale or where demand for the patented article is not being met to an adequate extent and on reasonable terms.17If a country comes to us and indicates that there is a health crisis or health emergency, particularly in respect of HIV-AIDS, we wouldconsult with the Department of Health and Human Services.... Wewould then be informed of that series of discussions and would takeaction which we believe would appropriately protect intellectualproperty rights but provide for the ability of the country at issue toensure that adequate and effective medications would be available ina cost-effective manner.\" 36 In furtherance of this stance and the intergovernmental discussions with the SouthAfrican Government, the United States on 27 January 2000 gave Thailandpermission to issue compulsory licenses for HIV/AIDS drugs under patent inThailand. In a letter to the chairman of the PHA Network of Thailand, the AssistantU.S. Trade Representative for Services, Investment and Intellectual Property wrote: \"We encourage Thai officials to explore all options for extending access to effective treatments, including ongoing direct dialogue withpharmaceutical manufacturers. But the final choice is one forThailand to make. If the Thai government determines that issuing acompulsory license is required to address its health crisis, the UnitedStates will raise no objection, provided the compulsory license isissued in a manner fully consistent with the WTO Agreement on TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).\" 37 On 10 May 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 13155, \"Accessto HIV/AIDS Pharmaceuticals and Medical Technologies\". It is worthwhile to cite a portion of the text: \"In administering sections 301-310 of the Trade Act of 1974, the United States shall not seek, through negotiation or otherwise, therevocation or revision of any intellectual property law or policy of abeneficiary sub-Saharan Africa country, as determined by thePresident, that regulates HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medicaltechnologies if the law or policy of the country: 1) Promotes access to HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical technologies for affected populations in thatcountry; and 2) Provides adequate and effective intellectual property consistent with the Agreement on Trade-Related 36 Press Briefing at WTO Ministerial Conference, 2 December 1999 (at www.ustr.gov/speech-test) . 37 Letter from Joseph S. Papovich to Mr. Paisan Tan-Ud of January 27, 2000, available on the web site of Consumer Project on Technology, www.cptech.org , under ip/health/aids. MSF reports that ddI is now being produced in Thailand in powder form, but not under compulsory license since this form is not covered by patent. See MSF Dossier 3, July 2000 at www. accessmed-msf.org .18Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) referred to in section 101 (d) (15) of theUruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C 3511 (d)(15). 38 It is clear from what is set out above that it has not been settled as to whether SouthAfrica's Medicines and Related Substances Control Act in fact satisfies the secondrequirement of the order. However, it is also clear that the U.S. government isprepared to condone what might previously have been considered to be a flouting ofthe TRIPS Agreement for the policy reasons set out in the order. The Executive Order further directs the U.S. government to encourage all beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries to implement policies designed to address theunderlying causes of the HIV/AIDS crisis by, among other things, encouragingprevention of infection, developing the infrastructure to deliver adequate healthservices, and providing incentives for research and development of vaccines andother medical innovations to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. The European Union similarly shifted its position with regard to compulsory licensing and parallel importation in recent months. It had previously joined theUnited States in pressuring South Africa. The shift was noticeable at the UNGeneral Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on Social Development in July 2000,where the EU tabled a text pointing out the inherent flexibility of the TRIPSAgreement, which could be used by developing countries to improve access todrugs. 39 The U.S. and EU objected to a proposal by South Africa that read in part: \"intellectual property rights under the WTO-TRIPS Agreement should not takeprecedence over the fundamental human right to the highest attainable standard ofhealth care ... and the ethical responsibility to provide life saving medications ataffordable cost to developing countries and people living in poverty.\" 40 The final text agreed to at the UNGASS includes the following: \"countries may freely exercise, consistent with national laws and international agreements acceded to, in an unrestricted manner, theoptions available to them under international agreements to protectand advance access to life-saving and essential medicines.\" 41 In September 2000, speaking in Brussels at a Round Table on CommunicableDiseases cosponsored by the European Commission, the WHO and UNAIDS,European Trade Commissioner Pascal Lamy stated: 38 Public Law 103-465, 108 Stat. 4809 39 Cecilia Oh, \"Patents versus Affordable Medicines at Geneva 2000\", Third World Network, 8 July 2000 (available on the web site of Health Action International at www.haiweb.org/news/summit.summary.html ). 40 Ibid. 41 Ibid.19\"In the trade area, I am committed to do whatever is necessary in order to shape the right conditions so that the poorest of the poor willhave access to the medicines they deserve at affordable prices... \"We are aware that consumer prices vary widely, within and amongst countries for a variety of reasons, such as differences in demand,purchasing capacity, tariffs, intellectual property rights, pricingmechanisms and the degree of competition between patented andgeneric medicines... \"In the area of intellectual property rights, it is acknowledged that TRIPS provides for the necessary flexibility to address public healthconcerns and emergency situations. It is not a question ofencouraging - or indeed discouraging - compulsory licensing. If theconditions of Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement are fulfilled, theauthorities can use this provision.\" 42 In the \"Communication of the Commission to the Council and the EuropeanParliament\", the Commission acknowledged that countries can use the flexibilitywithin the TRIPS Agreement to grant compulsory licenses to address public healthconcerns. 43 According to several commentators, including MSF, \"[t]his is a radical shift. In November 1999, an official of DG trade stated at a public meeting that patents had nothing to do with theaccess crisis and should not be used as a mechanism to address thisissue.\" 44 It should be noted that the Commission also advocates that industry used tieredpricing, together with effective measures to prevent parallel trading to higher pricedeveloped countries; voluntary licensing agreements, and cooperation between thegeneric and R&D based pharmaceutical industries 45. 42 EU Press Release \"Commissioner Lamy pledges action on access to medicines\", Brussels, 28 September 2000 (available on the EC web site athttp://europa.eu.int/comm/trade/whats_new/medic.html . 43 Communication of the Commission to the Council of the European Parliament, \"Accelerated action targeted at major communicable diseases within the context of poverty reduction\", COM (2000) 585 final, Brussels, 20 September 2000, p. 20. 44 M\u00e8decins San Fronti\u00e9res Press Release, \"Commission Looks at Link Between Patents and Prices of Life-Saving Drugs in Poor Countries\", Brussels, 28 September 2000. 45 Ibid. at 19-20.201.4 Compulsory Licensing, Parallel Imports and Generic Production Following the softening of U.S. and EU opposition to compulsory licensing and parallel importation, the drug companies began advancing offers of reduced pricing.In May 2000, as a result of growing pressure on the pharmaceutical industry from thepublic organizations concerned with the AIDS crisis and access to HIV/AIDS drugs,five companies including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck & Co, Glaxo Wellcome,Roche, and Boehringer Ingelheim agreed with officials of UNAIDS and the WorldBank to sell their drugs in sub-Saharan Africa at greatly reduced prices. However, adeal was not struck with an African country to secure the discounted drugs untilOctober 2000. 46 Senegal has negotiated a reduced price with Bristol-Myers for Zerit and Videx (d4T and ddI) taken together for $1.60 per day, or $584 per year, farbelow the cost in the U.S. 47 Even at the greatly reduced prices, however, the drugs still remain too high for mostpeople suffering from HIV/AIDS. The reader is referred to the country profilesannexed, which set out the average GDP figures. These figures make it clear thataffordability is a key issue and that the initiative of the pharmaceutical companiesmay not address the enormous problems facing the poorest populations whereHIV/AIDS has become an endemic crisis of the greatest magnitude. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that more than USD 2 billion in annual global investment is necessary. Yet only USD 300million has been invested in the effort this year. Over the past months, a growing chorus of commentators added their voices to the call for more affordable drugs. As stated in a New York Times editorial: \"In recent months, pharmaceutical companies, the World Bank, governments and foundations have promised donations of drugs ornew money, in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars' worth.Donated drugs are important, but South Africa is proposing a moresustainable solution - making cheap versions of still-patented drugsor importing them at less than the makers charge. These steps wereblocked by Washington - which has since changed its view - and thepharmaceutical industry. Wealthy countries should support SouthAfrica, and help all of Africa to get drugs at the lowest possibleprices.\" 48 Notwithstanding the view expressed by the New York Times , it is not at all clear whether attempts to abrogate patent protection through compulsory licensing andparallel importation will ultimately result in better access to medicines andhealthcare. The evidence from the information collected by IIPI from the 46 World Bank Press Release, \"Senegal Secures Price Reductions for HIV Drugs\", October 24, 2000. 47 Ibid. 48 \"AIDS in South Africa\", Editorial, The New York Times, July 12, 2000.21pharmaceutical companies, ARIPO, OAPI and sub-Saharan countries, dealt with in greater detail below, suggests that in countries where the drugs are not patented,there is still poor access to pharmaceuticals. Nonetheless, some have called for the generic production of HIV/AIDS drugs, citing Brazil as an example. 49 1997 marked the start of Brazil's controversial policy of producing HIV/AIDS drugs and the distribution thereof to patients, free of charge.Two decades ago, when the first cases of AIDS emerged in Brazil, health expertsforecast that by now the HIV virus would afflict at least 1.2 million Brazilians.Instead infection rates have returned to 1995 levels. 50 Key to Brazil's success in curtailing the death rate has been its drug distribution campaign and its decision tomanufacture generic pharmaceuticals. The Washington Post reports that: \"Today, government [Brazilian] labs churn out five generic AIDS medications.\" 51 With the introduction of Brazil's policy of universal access to antiretroviral drugs that,according to UNAIDS, currently benefits nearly all AIDS patients there (about85,000), the number of AIDS deaths between 1996 and 1999 have been nearlyhalved, and the incidence of opportunistic infections reduced by 60-80 percent. 52 Notwithstanding the production of generic pharmaceuticals, which Brazil had theknow-how and infrastructure to undertake, it is clear that Brazil's decision to do soaccompanied a substantial financial input. The programs' annual drug costs wereabout USD 339 million in 1999, and are expected to rise to USD 462 million for year2000 from a larger patient population and a larger proportion of patients on triplecombination therapy. According to UNAIDS, the annual cost of double therapy withnucleoside analogues in Brazil decreased on average by 80 percent between 1996and 2000, from USD 3,812 to USD 763 per patient. For triple therapy with twonucleosides and one protease inhibitor, the cost reduction was 36 percent (from USD7 342 to USD 4 717), and for triple therapy with two nucleosides and one non-nucleoside, it was 34 percent (from USD 4 584 to USD 3 009). 53 Hence, whether proprietary or generic drugs are used, affordability is a key element in access toHIV/AIDS drugs. As realistically stated by the advocacy group Project Inform: \"The pharmaceutical industry can and must be made to do its part in confronting AIDS, but it would be extremely na\u00efve of us to believethat lower drug prices alone will solve the problem. Blamingindustry for the entire problem is a convenient but false solution.There is a huge need for additional funding from the developednations and the major international private foundations, as well as asustained and corruption-free effort on the part of nations in need.There is plenty of blame to pass around for having let things get as 49 These include MSF, Health Action International, Consumer Project on Technology, for example. 50 \"Brazil becomes Model in Fight against AIDS\", Stephen Buckley, The Washington Post, 17 September 2000 51 Ibid 52 Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic at p. 101. 53 Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic at p. 102.22bad as they are. AIDS is the world's problem, and until we learn to address it as such, no real progress will be made.\"54 There is also concern that improper use of antiretrovirals will lead to the emergenceof mutations and new HIV strains that will be drug resistant. HIV is highly mutableand can develop resistance to a single drug in a matter of days. The experience withtuberculosis is instructive. It has been possible to effectively treat TB for over 50years, yet it remains a leading killer. A course of treatment for one patient costs aslittle as USD11.00, yet less than half of those diagnosed complete treatment. Theemergence of resistant strains of tuberculosis, related to poor compliance withtreatment prescriptions, threatens to make existing drugs ineffective worldwide. TBhas increased four-fold in many developing countries and has re-emerged aftersteady decline in parts of Eastern Europe. 55 There are also serious concerns about counterfeit and substandard products, as manydeveloping countries do not have the technical, financial or human resourcesrequired to monitor the quality of drug products. According to MSN, during themeningitis epidemic in Niger from February to May 1995, about 60,000 people wereinoculated with counterfeit vaccines that included no traces of the active effectiveproduct. 56 They state: \"MSF teams have encountered many similar field examples that lead to the following conclusions: organized illegal circuits seem moreinclined to manufacture copies with the appearance of knowntrademark drugs (counterfeit), rather than comparatively lessexpensive generic products; whereas, non-organized illegal circuits(small production) increasingly manufacture drugs whosecomposition is substandard or inadequate, including generic drugs.Poor quality may be accidental, with no intention to deceive, butoversights in manufacturing or neglected controls may sometimeshave tragic consequences. Such was the case during recent decadeswith acetaminophen syrups which contained, by mistake, a lethalingredient.\" 57 For these and other reasons, the WHO Guidance Module on use of antiretroviralsstates that certain essential specific services and facilities must be put in place beforeconsidering the introduction of antiretroviral treatment (ART) into any setting.These essential conditions include: \"Assured access to voluntary HIV counseling and testing and the institution of follow- up counseling services for ART to ensure 54 \"Drug Pricing, AIDS and the Developing Nations\" at p. 14. 55 Communication of the Commission to the Council of the European Parliament, p. 9. 56 \"Access to Essential Drugs in Poor Countries: A Lost Battle?\", Bernard Pecoul et al., MSF (at www.accessmed-msf.org ) 57 psychosocial support and to enhance adherence to treatment; \"Capacity to recognize and appropriately manage common HIV related illnesses and opportunistic infections; \"Reliable laboratory monitoring services including routine hematological and biochemical tests for the detection of drug toxicityas well as access to facilities for monitoring the immunologic andvirologic parameters of HIV infection; \"Assurance of an adequate supply of quality drugs, including drugs for the treatment of opportunistic infections and other HIV illnesses; \"Identification of sufficient resources to pay for treatments on a long- term basis; \"Information and training on safe and effective use of antiretroviral drugs for health professionals in a position to prescribe ART; and the \"Establishment of reliable regulatory mechanisms against misuse and misappropriation of antiretroviral drugs\". 58 The need to establish effective infrastructure to administer antiretroviral drugregimens is often overlooked in discussions on the HIV/AIDS crisis in sub-SaharanAfrica. 59 Calls to \"override patents\" and point blame at the TRIPS Agreement for blocking access to medicines are often made without reference to factors such asinfrastructure and drug resistance. But just what role do the TRIPS Agreement andpatents play in the access to HIV/AIDS drugs? The following chapters explore thisquestion. 58 WHO Initiative on HIV/AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections, \"Use of Antiretroviral Treatments in Adults\", Geneva 2000.04 (at www.who.int/HIV_AIDS ) 59 \"Call For Regional Manufacture of AIDS Drugs\", Panafrican News Agency, September 29, 2000 (at http://allafrica.com/stories/200009290299.html) .242. The International Patent Regime The establishment of the World Trade Organization on 1 January 1995 dramatically changed the landscape with regard to the patenting of drugs. For the first time in theworld trading system, countries that belong, or wish to belong, to the world tradingsystem must undertake to abide by comprehensive rules for the protection ofintellectual property rights. These rules, set out in the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (\"TRIPS\"), set minimum standardsfor the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, including patents,trademarks, copyrights and related rights, geographical indications, industrialdesigns, layout-designs of integrated circuits and undisclosed information. All WTOmembers must comply with these standards by giving them effect in their nationallegislation within the time periods prescribed in the Agreement. Failure of amember to implement its obligations under the TRIPS Agreement can result in acomplaint under the WTO dispute settlement system, which can ultimately result intrade sanctions authorized by the WTO against that member. Currently, the WTOhas 139 members 60, with almost 30 more candidates lining up for membership.61 Prior to the TRIPS Agreement, the Paris Convention for the Protection of IndustrialProperty, concluded in 1883 and revised several times since then, governedinternational patent relations. The Paris Convention, however, has not been revisedsince 1979, and lays down few rules regarding patents. It does not, for example,require that patents be available for any particular areas of technology, nor does itrequire any minimum term of protection or set of exclusive rights to be conferred on 60 The following are WTO members as of 1 December 2000: Albania, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bolivia,Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussub-Saharan Africalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Djibouti, Dominica,Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, European Communities, Fiji, France,Gabon, The Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea Bisub-SaharanAfricau, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland,Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Jordan, Japan, Kenya, Republic of Korea, Kuwait, The Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macau, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia,Netherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, Panama, Papua NewGuinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Rwanda, Saint Kitts andNevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent & the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, SlovakRepublic, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uruguay, Venezuela, Zambia and Zimbabwe. 61 28 governments are currently negotiating accession to the WTO: Algeria, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bhutan, Bosnia and Herzogovina, Cambodia, Cape Verde, People's Republic ofChina, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kazakstan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Moldova, Nepal, Russian Federation, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, Sudan, Chinese Taipei, Tonga, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Vietnam and Yemen. Lithuania completed accessionnegotiations on 2 October 2000 and the WTO's General Council is due to approve the accession inDecember.25patent holders. Several countries, therefore, excluded pharmaceutical products as being eligible for patent protection, and had widely divergent terms for patents. The developed countries, in seeking to provide the necessary incentives for drug innovation, successfully negotiated the mandatory protection of pharmaceuticalproducts, as well as processes in the TRIPS Agreement (with exceptions, limitationsand transition periods, discussed below). Given the high cost of developing newdrugs, and their low costs of reproduction, they are deemed especially worthy ofpatent protection by the developed countries. By giving limited exclusive rights tothe innovator in exchange for disclosure of new innovations, governments mustbalance the competing goals of encouraging innovation and benefiting society. Asoutlined in this chapter, the TRIPS Agreement does just that by including obligationsregarding protection, flexibility in their implementation, and permissible exceptionsand limitations on rights. There are, of course, several reasons for the high costs of medicines. To discover, develop, test and achieve regulatory approval is expensive. 62 Considerable time is taken to establish whether a drug is safe and in consequence only a few drugs sell ata price that meets or exceeds the costs of research and development of the drug. Clearly the debate centers around how to reach a balance between meeting the high costs of drug research and development and creating incentives to stimulate access tothose drugs in poor and developing countries. 62 From Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (Phrma) brochure available at www.phrma.org/publications .262.1 TRIPS Obligations Regarding Patents The TRIPS Agreement requires member states to make patent protection available for: \"any inventions, whether products or processes, in all fields of technology, provided they are new, involve an inventive step and arecapable of industrial application.\" (Article 27(1)) While Article 27 of the TRIPS Agreement does permit certain limited exceptions (not particularly relevant here), it also provides that: \"[P]atents shall be available and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the place of invention, the field of technology andwhether products are imported or locally produced.\" (Article 27(1)) These provisions thus require member states to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products, as well as processes. Patents must be granted for a term ofat least 20 years from the application filing date (Article 33). Patents must confer ontheir owners the exclusive rights to prevent third parties without consent frommaking, using, offering for sale, selling, or importing covered products (Article 28).These rights, however, may be limited to some extent, as noted in the next section. Finally, it is important to note the requirements of Article 39 (\"Protection of Undisclosed Information\"), which state in part: \"3. Members, when requiring, as a condition of approving the marketing of pharmaceutical or of agricultural chemical productswhich utilize new chemical entities, the submission of undisclosed testor other data, the origination of which involves a considerable effort,shall protect such data against unfair commercial use. In addition,Members shall protect such data against disclosure, except wherenecessary to protect the public, or unless steps are taken to ensurethat the data are protected against unfair commercial use.\" This provision requires WTO members to protect health registration data from disclosure or unfair commercial use, but its exact boundaries of \"unfair commercialuse\" are not entirely clear. In the United States, such data must be protected for fiveyears, while in the European Union, the period of data exclusivity is 10 years.Similarly, the parameters of \"necessary to protect the public\" are unclear.272.2 TRIPS Provisions for Flexibility In addition to the obligations regarding patent protection described above, the TRIPS Agreement includes several provisions that may provide flexibility in implementingand interpreting the provisions mentioned above relating to protection ofpharmaceutical products. Article 1 which outlines the nature and scope of obligations provides that: \"[m]embers may, but shall not be obliged to , implement in their law more extensive protection than is required by this Agreement, ...\" Several governments and NGO's have cited this provision in opposing efforts by some countries to seek protection beyond that mandated by the TRIPS Agreement. Article 7 which sets out the objectives of the Agreement provides: \"The protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights should contribute to ... the mutual advantage of producers and usersof technological knowledge and in a manner conductive to social and economic welfare , and to a balance of rights and obligations.\" (our emphasis). This provision recognizes that intellectual property protection is not an end by itself, but should be balanced to benefit society as a whole. Article 8 which sets forth the principles of the Agreement provides: \"1. Members may, in formulating their laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health andnutrition, and to promote the public interest in sectors of vitalimportance to their socio-economic and technologicaldevelopment, provided that such measures are consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. 2. Appropriate measures, provided that they are consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, may be needed to preventthe abuse of intellectual property rights by right holders or theresort to practices which unreasonably restrain trade oradversely affect the international transfer of technology.\" These provisions recognize that additional measures may be needed to achieve the desired balance between intellectual property protection and larger societal goals.They do require, however, that such measures be consistent with the TRIPSAgreement.28Article 73 which deals with the security exception states: \"Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed: ... (b) to prevent a Member from taking any action which it considers necessary for theprotection of its essential security interests; (iii) taken in time of waror other emergency in international relations; or (c) to prevent aMember from taking any action in pursuance of its obligations underthe United Nations Charter for the maintenance of internationalpeace and security.\" This provision permits action that would otherwise contravene the TRIPS Agreement, but only in very limited circumstances: in time of war or \"otheremergency in international relations\" or in pursuance of its UN Charter obligations\"for the maintenance of peace and security\". While these provisions must be borne in mind when interpreting the TRIPS Agreement, they do not fundamentally alter the obligations under the Agreement.The WTO Dispute Settlement body, in the case of the EU's complaint againstCanada for its exceptions to patent rights for pre-marketing testing and stockpiling ofgenerics, found the pre-marketing testing provision was not inconsistent with theTRIPS Agreement, while the \"stockpiling\" exception was a violation. 63 In so ruling, the panel noted that while the goals and limitations stated in Articles 7 and 8.1 mustbe borne in mind. Nevertheless, the panel reasoned, the very existence of Article 30that permits exceptions to patent rights under specific conditions, outlined below,amounts to a recognition that the definition of patent rights contained in Article 28might need certain adjustments. The conditions included in Article 30 \"testifystrongly that the negotiators of the Agreement did not intend Article 30 to bringabout what would be tantamount to a renegotiation of the basic balance of theAgreement.\" 64 The TRIPS Agreement, more importantly, includes provisions that permit memberstates to limit patent rights. These include provisions allowing members to legislatecertain limited exceptions to rights, to permit parallel imports, and to authorize use ofthe patented invention without the patent owner's consent, under certain conditions,a practice known as \"compulsory licensing\", dealt with more fully below. 63 Canada - Patent Protection of Pharmaceutical Products - Complaint by the European Communities and their member States, Report of the Panel, World Trade Organization, WT/DS114/R, 17 March2000. 64 Ibid at p. 154.292.3 Limited Exceptions to Patent Rights Article 30 of the TRIPS Agreement permits member states to provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent. The article provides thatthese limitations, however: \"must not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of thepatent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of thirdparties.\" Although the precise boundaries of permissible exceptions under this provision are not known, they are generally believed to permit experimental uses and non-commercial uses currently practiced in several countries, including the United States. Of particular interest with regard to access to drugs is the so-called \"Bolar\" exception to patent rights in the United States that permits pre-marketing testing ofgeneric products during the patent term. The \"Bolar\" exception to patent rightsallows generic manufacturers to conduct tests needed to prepare their applications forregulatory approval during the term of the patent, so that they are then able to markettheir products immediately upon expiration of the patent. In the United States, this exception was codified as a compromise between the research-based pharmaceutical industry and the generic industry in 1984, with theenactment of patent term restoration (up to five years to compensate for the loss ofpatent term caused by required regulatory approvals). As noted above, thisexception as applied by Canada was held to be consistent with the TRIPS Agreementby a WTO Dispute Settlement panel, even though Canada's \"Bolar\" exception wasnot balanced, as in the U.S., with the possibility of patent term restoration.302.4 Parallel Importation The rights conferred by patents enumerated in Article 28 are not absolute. They may be limited by the \"exhaustion\" doctrine. Article 6 of TRIPS provides that the issueof exhaustion of intellectual property rights is not subject to WTO dispute settlement.A complaint cannot be brought against a member, therefore, if that member adopts apatent regime based on \"international exhaustion\" and thereby permits parallelimports. Also sometimes known as the \"first sale\" doctrine, the exhaustion principleallows a member state to limit application of a patent right once a product protectedby the patent has been sold. In the U.S., this doctrine normally applies as a \"national exhaustion\" principle, meaning that the patent owner can no longer exercise control over the product once itis placed on the domestic market in the United States. The patent owner, however,may exercise his rights with regard to products placed on the market outside of theUnited States. The European Union countries apply a \"regional exhaustion\"principle, whereby patent rights are exhausted only with regard to products placed onthe market in EU countries. Many countries apply an \"international exhaustion\" regime, whereby a patent owner may not exercise rights over products once they have been put on the marketanywhere in the world. This limitation on the patent owner's exclusive importationright effectively permits others to import the patented product if it has already beenput on the market by the patent owner anywhere in the world. Known as parallelimportation, this practice allows for \"comparison shopping\" among markets where apatent owner sells the product in different markets at different prices. Because thetopic of \"exhaustion\" is not subject to the WTO dispute settlement procedures, aWTO complaint cannot be brought against a member state that adopts a patentregime based on \"international exhaustion\" and thereby permits parallel imports. However, to the extent that a country has a drug regulatory system in place and requires test data for marketing approval, it is unclear to what extent parallelimportation might run foul of Article 39.3 of the TRIPS Agreement, which requiresprotection of test data for some period of time.312.5 Compulsory Licensing The TRIPS Agreement permits members to use patented inventions without the authorization of the patent owner, either by the government (so-called \"governmentuse\") or by third parties (so-called \"compulsory licensing\"), as long as certainprocedural conditions are met. The grounds upon which a compulsory license maybe granted, or government use authorized, are not restricted by the TRIPS Agreement, except in three areas: non-working and dependent patents (discussedbelow) and semi-conductor technology (not relevant here). Where the prescribedprocedural conditions are followed, compulsory licenses are permitted on any grounds, including public health, national interest, food security, etc. The most relevant conditions prescribed in Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement include: - authorization of use without the consent of the patent owner must be considered on its individual merits; - efforts to obtain a voluntary license on reasonable terms and conditions must first be made (except for government use, which only requiresnotification); - the scope and duration of the use must be limited to the purpose for which it was authorized; - the use must be non-exclusive; - the use must be authorized predominantly for the supply of the domestic market of the member authorizing the use; - the authorization of use can be terminated if and when the circumstances which led to it cease to exist and are unlikely to recur; - the patent owner must be paid adequate remuneration taking into account the economic value of the authorization; and - the decisions relating to authorization and remuneration must be subject to judicial review or other independent review by a distinct higherauthority in that member. It should be noted that the requirement to first seek a voluntary license does not apply to government use. This requirement is also waived where a compulsorylicense is authorized to remedy behavior found to be anti-competitive by judicial oradministrative process. In addition, the requirement that the use be predominantlyfor the domestic market does not apply in such cases, and the \"need to correct anti-competitive practices may be taken into account in determining the amount ofremuneration\".32As mentioned, there are three situations that have additional rules: authorizing use for \"non-working\" patents, for dependent patents, and for semi-conductortechnology. A member may only authorize use of semiconductor technology bythird parties to remedy a practice determined to be anti-competitive. A memberstate may only authorize the use of a dominant patent by the holder of a \"dependent\"patent if three conditions apply: (1) the dependent patent represents an important technical advance of considerable economic significance; (2) the owner of the dominant patent is entitled to a cross-license (to practice the invention of the dependent patent); and (3) the use authorized is not assignable except with the assignment of the dependent patent. More relevant to this report is the situation with regard to authorization of use for \"non-working\" patents, i.e., where a member wishes to grant a license to practice theinvention to a third party because the patent owner is not \"working\" his inventionlocally. In this situation, two additional conditions apply. First, the ParisConvention places time limits on when such licenses can be granted, and these, alongwith all substantive provisions of the Paris Convention, are incorporated into Article2 (1) of the TRIPS Agreement. Article 5 of the Paris Convention provides, inter alia , that countries have the right to take legislative measures providing for the grant of compulsory licenses: \"to prevent the abuses which might result from the exercise of the exclusive rights conferred by the patent, for example, failure to work.\" It further provides that a compulsory license may not be applied for on the ground of failure to work or insufficient \"working\" before the expiration of four years from thedate of filing, or three years from the date of grant, whichever expires later, and thatthe compulsory license shall be refused if the patentee justifies his inaction bylegitimate reasons. These conditions imposed on \"non-working\" compulsorylicenses do not apply to compulsory licenses and government use based on othergrounds such as public health or national interest. Another limitation on compulsory licenses or government use for \"non-working\" patents is imposed by Article 27(1) of the TRIPS Agreement, which states in part: \"patents shall be available and patent rights enjoyable without discrimination as to the place of invention, the field of technology and whether products are imported or locally produced. \" (our emphasis).33This provision would seem to require that importation of products should be deemed to satisfy a local working requirement.342.6 Transition Periods Developing countries, countries in transition to market economies, and least developed countries were given longer transition periods to implement the TRIPSAgreement into their national legislation than developed countries. In addition thereare special provisions relating to the protection of pharmaceutical products, outlinedbelow. Developed countries were given one year to bring their legislation into conformity with the TRIPS Agreement and all countries were required to implement the nationaltreatment and most-favored-nation provisions within that time, i.e., by 1 January1996. Developing country members, and members in the process of transition to amarket economy, were given an additional four years to implement the TRIPSAgreement, i.e., until 1 January 2000 (Article 65). Least developed countrymembers were given until 1 January 2006, to implement TRIPS, in view of theirspecial needs and requirements, \"their economic, financial and administrativeconstraints, and their need for flexibility to create a viable technology base.\" (Article66(1)). Further, the Council for TRIPS is instructed to accord extensions of thisperiod to least developed country members upon a duly motivated request. Article 65(4) provides that developing countries that did not extend patent protection to required areas, such as pharmaceutical products, on January 1, 1995, were given atransition period of five years, in addition to the general five-year transition periodfor developing countries, to introduce such protection. Such developing countries,therefore, have until January 1, 2005, to introduce patent protection for drugs if they did not already have it. There are a number of transition periods set out in Article 65. These are: one year for developed countries, five years for developing countries and countries in transitionand 11 years for new patentable subject matter. The periods must be read, however,in conjunction with the \"standstill\" clause 5 of Article 65. This clause prohibitsmembers from using the transition periods to change legislation so that the result is a\"lesser degree of consistency with the provisions of this Agreement.\" This provisionis meant to preclude countries that already had TRIPS-consistent legislation fromrevising the legislation in any way that would result in inconsistency with theAgreement during the transition period. It is important to note that clause 65 doesnot apply to least developed countries. Finally, Article 70, which deals with protection of existing subject matter, imposes immediate obligations relating to pharmaceutical products on member states that didnot have patent protection for such products available on the date of entry into forceof the WTO (January 1, 1994). As from that date, Article 70(8)(c) requires thatthese states must establish a so-called \"mail box\", or a means to accept patentapplications on these products immediately. The reasoning behind the provision is toensure that, when these states do make patent protection available for pharmaceuticalproducts, the inventions will be examined for novelty as of their \"mail box\" filing35date, or foreign priority date under the Paris Convention. This provision will permit the patenting of these inventions when protection is introduced because they havenot lost their \"novelty\" due to a late filing date, for example, after publication byanother patent office. The term of such patents will run for 20 years from the filingdate. Article 70(9) requires that \"mail box\" applications filed after January 1, 1994 must also be eligible for \"exclusive marketing rights\" under certain conditions,notwithstanding the transition periods provided to developing and least developedcountries. A \"mail box\" country must grant exclusive marketing rights to theproduct of a \"mail box\" patent application for a period of five years, or until aproduct patent is granted or rejected by that member, if: (1) a patent has been granted, and marketing approval obtained, in another WTO member state; and (2) marketing approval has been granted by the \"mail box\" country. This creates an unusual situation under the TRIPS Agreement, i.e. a country that did not have product patent protection for drugs on 1 January 1994, may be required togrant exclusive marketing rights at least until it can grant or reject the patentapplication. A country that has product patent protection for drugs can reject theapplication and have no obligation to provide exclusive marketing rights. Bearing this overall framework in mind the section following explores Sub-Saharan African national and regional legislation and the patent situation of certainHIV/AIDS drugs.363. The Patent Situation in Sub-Saharan Africa At the time the TRIPS Agreement entered into force on 1 January 1995, only three countries in continental sub-Saharan Africa excluded pharmaceutical products frompatentability: Angola, Ghana, and Malawi. 65 There are substantial differences among sub-Saharan African countries, however, in the particulars of their patentlaws, especially with regard to parallel importation and compulsory licensing. Thissection attempts to provide an outline of the various patent regimes in sub-SaharanAfrica, both national and regional. It also describes efforts by the International Intellectual Property Institute (IIPI) to determine the patent status of the anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs for HIV/AIDS. Despitethe possibility of obtaining protection in these most African countries, manypharmaceutical companies have not filed for or obtained patents in the sub-SaharanAfrican countries. The International Intellectual Property Institute has conductedsurveys in attempts to determine the patent situation of the anti-retroviral (ARV)drugs for HIV/AIDS. The IIPI sent letters to all of the national patent offices insub-Saharan Africa and to the drug manufacturers. In addition, letters were sent tothe African Regional Industrial Property Office (ARIPO) and the African IndustrialProperty Office (Organization Africaine de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle or \"OAPI\") inan attempt to determine the patent status of these drugs. This section presents theresults of the information obtained, together with information gathered from othersources. This information builds upon earlier work done by UNAIDS with WHO and UNICEF in attempting to determine the patent status of HIV/AIDS medicines indeveloping countries. According to UNAIDS' analysis, most proprietary drugs usedin the treatment of HIV/AIDS are not protected by patents in the majority ofdeveloping countries. 66 A drug industry representative, Jeff Sturchio of Merck & Co., who has noted that South Africa is one of the few countries in Africa in whichpatents are registered, supports this finding. \"Why are generic manufacturers notalready providing access in these countries, where the patents are not there?\" heasks. 67 The patent status of a drug in a particular country is difficult to ascertain for severalreasons. Some drugs are covered by more than one patent, for example, there maybe a patent registered for the product, a manufacturing process, and/or a differentformulation or use. Most patent offices in the region are not fully automated, and insome cases lack adequate staff to conduct reliable searches of records. Furthermore,most countries require the payment of \"maintenance fees\" to maintain a patent in 65 WIPO Document HL/CM/INF/1 Rev. 2 (July 1992). 66 Report on the Global HIV/AIDS Epidemic at p. 100. See also \"Patent Situation of HIV/AIDS- Related Drugs in 80 Countries\", P. Boulet, J. Perriens and F. Renaud-Th\u00e9ry, UNAIDS/WHO, Geneva, January 2000. 67 Belinda Beresford, \"Drugs Let the Rich Buy a Few More Years of Life\", The Mail & Guardian, 14 July 2000 (at www.mg.co.za/mg/new/2000july1/14Jul-aids2.html) .37force once it has been granted, and it is often difficult to determine whether these fees have been paid by the patent owner, and hence, whether a patent, even ifgranted, remains in force. For all of these reasons, the International Intellectual Property Institute presents the results of its surveys with the following caveat. The indications of patent status areindicative only, and are based on the responses received by the drug companies andpatent offices, which were not complete. The vast majority of sub-Saharan African countries belong to one of the two regional patent systems that are serviced by the two regional offices for Africa: ARIPO forEnglish-speaking countries and OAPI for French-speaking countries. Each of theseregional offices has 15 member countries. The membership of each organization isshown below, as well as the continental sub-Saharan African countries that do notbelong to either organization. ARIPO Members: OAPI Cameroon Dem. Republic of CongoKenya Central African Republic DjiboutiLesotho Congo Equatorial GuineaMalawi Ivory Togo All OAPI states are members of the WTO as are all ARIPO states except Somalia and Sudan. Of the countries not belonging to either OAPI or ARIPO, all are WTOmembers except Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Liberia. It is important to note that the following sub-Saharan countries are designated by the United Nations as least developed: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, CapeVerde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo,Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Guinea, Lesotho, Liberia,Malawi, Mauritania, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, 68 68 \"About LDC's\" from http://www.unctad.org/en/subsites/ldcs/aboutldc.htm .38As noted in section 2.6 above, least developed countries are given a transition period of 11 years under the TRIPS Agreement, namely until 1 January 2006, to implementits provisions. Notwithstanding the flexibility afforded to least developed countriesby the TRIPS Agreement, the patent laws of many of these least developed countrieshave already been amended to implement TRIPS, in many cases in conjunction withtheir membership in a regional system, as more fully set out below. Despite theavailability of patent protection for pharmaceutical products, however, few of theHIV/AIDS drugs are patented widely in sub-Saharan Africa.393.1 ARIPO The \"Industrial Property Organization for English-Speaking Africa\" (ESARIPO) was created with the signature of the Lusaka Agreement in 1976. In 1985, thisorganization was renamed the \"African Regional Industrial Property Organization\"(ARIPO). Located in Harare, Zimbabwe, ARIPO currently has 15 member states. 69 As mentioned previously, all ARIPO member states, except Somalia and Sudan, arealso members of the WTO. In December 1982, ARIPO adopted the Harare Protocol (\"the Protocol\"), which empowers the ARIPO office to receive and process patent and industrial designapplications on behalf of states party to the Protocol. Currently, all ARIPO membersexcept Somalia have signed the Protocol. By filing a single application with ARIPO, patent applicants can designate any of the Protocol members in which protection is sought. 70 ARIPO arranges for the substantive examination of the application and makes recommendations to thedesignated members, who may refuse to grant a patent within six months if theinvention is deemed to be unpatentable under the Protocol or under national law. If amember does not refuse the patent within a six-month period, ARIPO grants thepatent, which has the same effect as a national patent in each designated state, and isgoverned by the laws of those states. A reference to the grant is published in thequarterly ARIPO Journal , and a copy of the grant certificate and patent are sent to each designated State for which the patent is granted. Under the Protocol, patents granted by ARIPO were subject to the national law of each designated state with regard to patent term, working requirements, compulsorylicenses, and nullification. The Protocol was revised on November 26, 1999, toimplement the obligations under the TRIPS Agreement for ARIPO member states.The revised 1999 Protocol established a uniform patent term of 20 years from theapplication filing date. All but two (Ghana and Malawi) of the ARIPO memberstates already provided patent protection for pharmaceutical products at that time.The revised version of the Protocol came into force on 1 January 2000, and appliesto all ARIPO patents still in force at that time. 71 3.2 OAPI 69 ARIPO also has 10 observers who represent potential ARIPO member states: Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Seychelles and South Africa. 70 Applicants may also use the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) to designate members of the Harare Protocol who are also members of the PCT. Currently 12 ARIPO members are members of both the Protocol and the PCT: the Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Sierra Leone,Sudan, Medicins sans Frontieres (MSF), \"Patent Protection of Medicines in Kenya and Uguanda\", April 2000, Report for discussion at the MSF Conference on \"Improving Access toEssential Medicines in East Africa - Patents and Prices in a Global Economy, Nairobi, June 15-16,2000.40OAPI serves as the regional industrial property office for French-speaking Africa. It succeeds the OAMPI (Office Africain et Malgache de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Industrielle)which was created by the Libreville Agreement of 1962 to serve as the uniformpatent law and the common patent office for each member. Until 1962, French lawsgoverned patent rights in the majority of the member states. The Bangui Agreementof March 2, 1977, revised the Libreville Agreement and created the OAPI, whichnow has 15 member states, all of which are WTO members. By filing a single application with OAPI, patent applicants may obtain a patent that covers all 15 OAPI member states. Unlike ARIPO, no designation of individualmember states is made. 72 The 1977 Bangui Agreement serves as the national patent law for all OAPI members. Under the Bangui Agreement, which took effect in 1982,the term of patents is 10 years from the application filing date, with the possibility oftwo extensions of five years each. Application for the first extension must includeproof of sufficient working of the patented invention in at least one of the OAPImember states at the time of application for the extension, or legitimate reasons fornon-use. Importation of the patented product does not constitute a legitimate reason for not working the invention (\"non-working\"). Application for the secondextension likewise must include proof of working, and legitimate reasons for non-working are not permitted for the second extension. 73 Once patents are granted by OAPI, they are regulated by the member states, whosecourts deal with such issues as infringement and compulsory licenses. Compulsorylicenses may be granted by OAPI member states for \"non-working\" inventionswithin the time periods established under Article of the Paris Convention and fordependent patents. \"Ex officio\" licenses also may be granted by OAPI members forinventions of great importance to the national defense, for the public health, or forthe national economy where the product cannot be obtained in sufficient quantitieson reasonable conditions. The licenses may be granted for importation in cases ofinventions of great importance to the national defense or public health. The 1977 Bangui Agreement does not permit parallel importation, because the patent owner is given the right to exclude imports. However, no action for infringementcan be brought if the patent is not sufficiently worked in at least one of the OAPImember states within 5 years from grant (unless there are legitimate reasons for non-working). The OAPI member states revised the 1977 Bangui Agreement in 1999 to implement the TRIPS Agreement. The revised Bangui Agreement, signed on 24 February 1999is not yet in force. It would extend the patent term to 20 years from the filing date,add new restrictions on compulsory licensing, and permit parallel imports only fromOAPI members. 74 The pending Agreement in many ways establishes the standards 72 Patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty designating OAPI apply only likewise apply to all OAPI member states, since they have each also joined the PCT. 73 Manual of Industrial Property, ... 74 Pascale Boulet and Gilles-Bernard Forte, \"Drug Patents in French Speaking Africa\", report of Joint Mission (Medicins Sans Frontieres, UNAIDS & Cameroon, February available on the MSF web site, www.msf.org41required under the TRIPS Agreement, although criticism has been leveled at it for creating onerous obligations not mandated by TRIPS.75 Of the 15 member states of OAPI, only 6, viz. Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Gabon and Senegalare developing countries that were required to implement TRIPS obligations byJanuary 1, 2000. 75 Ibid.423.3 Other Sub-Saharan Africa Countries76 Angola Angola was subject to Portuguese law until 1975, when it became an independent state. It had been a Portuguese colony until 1951 and Overseas Province of Portugaluntil 1975. In 1992, Industrial Property Law No 3/92 of February 28, 1992 wasenacted and entered into force on March 29, 1992. This law, which remains in force, does not permit the patenting of pharmaceutical products, although protection is available for processes and apparatus for themanufacture of such products. The term of patents is 15 years from the date ofapplication filing. Compulsory licenses are available in cases where a patent is notlocally exploited within three years from grant, without legitimate excuse for non-working; for the needs of the domestic market have not been met; and where thegovernment believes that exploitation of the patent is of vital importance for thepublic interest, national security, public health or the economy. Burundi Formerly named Urundi, which was part of the Belgian Trust-Territory of Ruanda- Urundi, became independent in 1962. The Patents Act of 1964 and PatentRegulations of 1965, as amended by Decree No. 1/170 of 1968, now govern patentmatters in Burundi. Patents are available for all inventions for a term of 20 years from the application filing date. Patents are granted without examination. There are no provisions forcompulsory licenses, but any interested party may bring a court action forcancellation of a patent if the invention is not exploited in Burundi within two yearsfrom the date of first commercial working abroad. Democratic Republic of the Congo The former Belgian Congo became an independent state in 1960. Patents are governed by Law No. 82-01 of 1982 and by Ordinance No. 89-173 of August 1989,implementing the law. Patents are available for 20 years from the application filing date, but inventions relating to a medicine may only be patented if the subject matter is a product,substance or compound for the first time presented as constituting a medicine. Inother words, new uses and formulations are not patentable. The law includes a 76 The source for information on the countries in this section is the Manual of Industrial Property B.V., Utrecht, The Netherlands, May 2000 (ISBN 90 7188 01 0).43requirement for local working within five years from the application filing or three years from patent grant, whichever is later, or a compulsory license may be grantedfor non-working if certain conditions are met. After two years from the grant of thefirst compulsory license, the Patent Office may bring an action for forfeiture of thepatent for non-working or insufficient working. An applicant for a compulsory license must provide evidence that he or she has first tried to obtain a voluntary license from the patentee, and must prove that he or shehas the means for working the patented invention in such a way that the needs of themarket may be met. The Patent Office may grant an ex officio license for working of a patent by the State or a third party on its behalf in cases where non-working or insufficient workingwould prejudice the economic development of the country in particular and thepublic interest in general. Djibouti The Republic of Djibouti became an independent country in 1977, following administration by France as the Territory of the Afars and Issas (formerly FrenchSomaliland). There is no patent law at present, but prior to independence, patentrights acquired in France extended to the former Territory. As a least developedcountry WTO member, Djibouti has until at least 2006 to implement the TRIPSAgreement. Equatorial Guinea The former Spanish territories of Fernando Po and R\u00edo Muni (Spanish Guinea) became the independent state of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea in 1968. Patentsare governed by Decree-Law 7/1987 of 1987, Decree No. 56 of 1990 and No. 38 of1991. Eritrea The former Italian colony of Eritrea became federated with Ethiopia in 1852 and from 1962 until 1993 was fully integrated into Ethiopia as one of its 14 provinces.Eritrea became an independent country in 1993 and currently has no patent law.Since that time, it is no longer possible to seek patent protection in Eritrea throughEthiopia. Ethiopia Patents in Ethiopia are governed by Proclamation No. 123 of 1995.44Liberia Patents in Liberia are governed by the Act Adopting a New Patent, Copyright and Trademark Law, Title 24, of 1972. Patents are granted for all inventions for a termof 20 years from the application filing date. Foreigners who do not put a patented invention into active operation within three years from the grant date are deemed to have abandoned the patent to the public.The law also has a government use provision that only applies to patents that can beused in radio, television, telegraph, telephone or power stations. Namibia Namibia gained full independence in 1990, following its administration by South Africa since 1915 and as a German protectorate between 1884 and 1915. Patents aregoverned by Act No. 9 of 1916, Proclamation No. 17 of 1923 and Patent Rules of1917, last amended in 1942, and South West African Affairs Act No. 25 of 1969.Patents are available for all inventions for a term of 14 years from the applicationfiling date. Extension of the patent term is available from the Court on grounds ofinadequate remuneration for seven, or in exceptional circumstances, for 14 years. Patents must be exploited in such a manner that the reasonable requirements of the public are met within two years from grant, or they become subject to compulsorylicense. If the Court determines that the reasonable requirements of the public havenot been met by the grant of a compulsory license, the patent may be revoked on thegrounds of inadequate working after three years from patent grant. Nigeria Patents in Nigeria are governed by Patents and Designs Decree No. 60 of 1970, Patents and Designs Order of 1971, and Patents and Designs (Additional Transitionaland Saving Provisions) Order of 1972. Patents are granted for a term of 20 years from the application filing date, except that the following inventions are not patentable: plant or animal varieties, or essentiallybiological processes for the production of plants or animals (other thanmicrobiological processes and their products); inventions the publication orexploitation of which would be contrary to public order or morality; and principlesand discoveries of a mere scientific nature. Compulsory licenses may be granted if, after four years from the filing or three years from patent grant, whichever is later, the invention has not been worked on acommercial scale so as to reasonably meet the demand in Nigeria; or the working isbeing prevented or hindered by the importation of the patented article; or that, by thefailure of the patentee to grant licenses on reasonable terms, the establishment or45development of industrial or commercial activities in Nigeria is unfairly and substantially prejudiced. Dependent patent compulsory licenses are also available.Finally, the Commissioner of Patents may order that compulsory licenses and/orpermission for importation may be granted for inventions of vital importance for thedefense or economy of Nigeria or for public health. Rwanda Formerly Ruanda, part of the Belgian Trust-Territory of Ruanda-Urundi, Rwanda became independent in 1962. Patents are governed by the Patents Act of 1963 andPatents Regulations of 1967. Patents are granted for all inventions for a term of 20 years from the application filing date. Although there are no provisions for compulsory licensing, anyinterested party may bring court action for the cancellation of a patent if theinvention is not exploited in Rwanda within two years from the date of firstcommercial working abroad. South Africa The Patents Act (No. 57 of 1978), as last amended by Intellectual Property Laws Amendment Acts prior to 1998, and the Intellectual Property Laws RationalisationAct of 1996, govern patents in South Africa. The Medicines and Related SubstancesControl Act of 1997 is discussed in Section 1.3 above. Patents are granted for inventions for a term of 20 years from the application filing date but the following are not patentable: inventions the publication or exploitationof which would be generally expected to encourage offensive or immoral behavior;plant or animal varieties and essentially biological processes for the production ofplants or animals, with the exception of microbiological processes thereof; methodsof treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy or of diagnosispracticed on the human or animal body. The law permits patenting of pharmaceuticalsubstances. The law permits government use and compulsory licensing under sections 4 and 56. Section 4 permits any Minister of State to use an invention for public purposes,either under agreement with the patent owner, or in the absence of agreement, underconditions as determined by the Commissioner of Patents after hearing from thepatent owner. Section 56 provides for compulsory licensing for abuse of patentrights and for dependent patents. \"Abuse of patents\" is deemed to occur where thepatented invention is not being worked in South Africa after the expiration of threeyears from grant or four years from filing, whichever is later, without satisfactoryreason for non-working; where demand for the patented article in South Africa is notbeing met to an adequate extent and on reasonable terms; where because of thepatent owner's refusal to grant a license on reasonable terms, the trade, industry or46agriculture of South Africa is being prejudiced; or where the patent owner, his/her licensee or agent is charging excessively high prices in relation to prices charged inother countries.473.4 Results of Patent Surveys The IIPI has conducted an analysis of what patents have been applied for in sub- Saharan African countries in respect of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals. In this regardwe have written to the patent offices of all sub-Saharan African countries requestingthem to provide information as to whether patents have been applied for, whetherthey have been granted and if granted, whether they are they still in force. Thisinformation was sought for the following pharmaceuticals (with the manufacturernoted): (Agenerase) Glaxo Wellcome In addition to requesting this information from the respective countries' patent offices, we have requested the information from ARIPO and OAPI and from thepharmaceutical companies manufacturing the drugs.

Where a patent is in force for a particular drug in a 77 As will be evident from the tables below, the South African Medicines Control Council (MCC) approved and registered Combivir, a mix of Zidovudine (AZT) and Lamivudine (3TC) on 10 November 2000. The drug, however, will still not be available to the public sector, other than tohealth workers who are at risk through their occupation. 78 See above note.48particular country, that box in the table is marked \"yes\". Note that the responses to IIPI's surveys, however, were incomplete. Hence this information should beconsidered indicative only. Of all the sub-Saharan African countries written to, onlyMalawi, Mauritius, The Democratic Republic of the Congo, Niger, Eritrea andEthiopia responded. ARIPO replied on behalf of all its member countries. Of thedrug companies written to, the following replied: Boehringer Ingelheim, Merck &Co, Abbott, Upjohn and Agouran (Pharmacia).

Conclusions 4.1 The TRIPS Agreement is Not the Problem The TRIPS Agreement is not impeding access to medicines in sub-Saharan Africa. As outlined in Chapter 2 of this report, the TRIPS Agreement permits sufficientflexibility for African countries to expand access to HIV/AIDS drugs where othercritical elements are in place, such as health care infrastructure and financing.Furthermore, for most sub-Saharan African countries, i.e., those that are designatedas \"least developed\" by the United Nations, TRIPS obligations are not mandatoryuntil 2006 at the earliest. The least developed countries in Sub-Saharan Africainclude: - 8 of the 15 members of OAPI, namely Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Guinea, Mauritania, Niger, Chad and Togo; - 7 of the 15 members of ARIPO, namely The Gambia, Lesotho, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Tanzania, and Zambia; and - 9 of the 12 other countries of continental sub-Saharan Africa, namely Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea,Eritrea, Ethiopia, Liberia, and Rwanda. Of the 16 sub-Saharan African countries in which more than one-tenth of the adult population is infected with HIV, 8 are least developed countries with no obligationsunder the TRIPS Agreement until at least 2006, namely Burundi, Central AfricanRepublic, Djibouti, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Rwanda and Zambia. The lack of access to medicines in sub-Saharan Africa is the result of a wide and complex range of causes. Laying blame for the problem on the WTO and the TRIPSAgreement is overly simplistic and wrong, and does nothing to alleviate the crisis. 4.2 Patents are Not the Problem The patent issue, likewise, is dramatically overplayed in the discussions on access to HIV/AIDS medicines. The perception that patents are blocking access to HIV/AIDSdrugs is also overly simplistic and incorrect. As discussed in Chapter 3 of this report, our patent surveys shows that most antiretroviral medications are not widely patented in Africa. In the majority ofcountries of sub-Saharan Africa where no patents exist, there is still a dramatic lackof access to drugs. Similarly, there are tremendous access problems with medicineslong ago off patent.53Where patents do exist, the TRIPS Agreement permits a great deal of flexibility to seek compulsory licenses or parallel imports of drugs under patent. The UnitedStates and European Union have indicated that they will not oppose such practicesconsistent with the TRIPS Agreement. While it may be easy to use the drug industry as a scapegoat, patents are not blocking access to HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa. Even if antiretroviralHIV/AIDS drugs were made available free tomorrow, there is a lack of health careinfrastructure to conduct testing, store and distribute medications, and monitorpatient compliance with what are often very complicated regimens. Nils Daulaire,President of the Global Health Council, is among a growing chorus acknowledgingthat the challenge is much deeper than cheaper medications. \"Even if AIDS drugswere free, no more than 10 to 20 percent of Africans would benefit as the healthinfrastructures do not exist to manage infections in each individual\", he said. 79 Compounding the problem is the fact that in some countries, governments lack thepolitical will to direct needed attention and resources to the problem of HIV/AIDS. 4.3 Financing is the Problem It is increasingly widely accepted that the lack of availability of HIV/AIDS medicines is the result of a wide and complex range of causes, primary amongstwhich is a lack of financial resources to fund the health care system in general. Percapita incomes, and hence the availability of private resources for expenditures onmedicines (whether generic or branded), are among the lowest in the world in sub-Saharan Africa. Governments also lack the resources to adequately fund health careinfrastructure given their high debt burdens and the vast number of competingspending needs. According to the WHO, public spending on drugs in over three dozen countries, many in sub-Saharan Africa, is less than $2 per capita per year. \"In such countries,inadequate and misdirected financing is arguably the greatest barrier to access to life-saving essential drugs.\" 80 Further complicating the problem is the lack of insurance. Only 10.3% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa are covered by health insurance,requiring out-of-pocket expenditure that accounts for up to 80% of total healthexpenditures in some countries. 81 According to the WHO, \"Affordability of drugs could be increased substantially however, by eliminating or reducing import duties, distribution costs anddispensing fees. These can account for up to 80% of the total pricepaid for drugs. In particular, import duty can be as high as 30%, 79 Gumisai Mutume, \"Development: Africa Shuns US Move Allowing Access to Cheaper AIDS Drugs\", Inter Press Service, www.oneworld.org/ips2/July00/20_17_075.html , July 26 80 WHO Medicines Strategy 2000-2003 at p. 39. 81 Ibid.54while value-added and other national and local taxes can amount to 20% of a drug cost.82 Current levels of foreign assistance are completely inadequate to support the neededcosts to build the needed infrastructure and support drug purchase costs. This is truewhether the purchase of generic drugs or patented drugs is involved. As notedrecently in the newsletter of the AIDS advocacy organization Project Inform: \"The cost of drugs is only a small part of the problem. Building the necessary medical infrastructure will also be costly, as will bemeeting the most fundamental needs for food and clean water. ...President Clinton has declared the spread of AIDS in developingnations an urgent matter of US national security. If we believe this,then he and other western heads of state must begin to treat it assuch. Just as they met to discuss intervention in Bosnia or to launchwarfare against Iraq, they must now meet to plot out national andinternational strategy against this threat. They must beginnegotiations and planning efforts with the heads of the affectednations, as well as grass roots representatives of the people in thosenations. And they must begin to adjust their thinking in terms ofdollars. Current efforts amount to a few hundred million dollars hereand there, this from a country that spends roughly one and a halfbillion each time the space shuttle makes a supply run into orbit.\" 83 Renewed dedication from all quarters is urgently needed to stem the tide of sufferingand death, to address the threat to peace and security and to make significant inroadsin combating the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan. Significantly increased donorassistance is needed to build the needed health care infrastructure and to support drugpurchases, whether generic or branded drugs is contemplated. Blaming the WTO, theTRIPS Agreement or patent holders for the lack of access to medicines will notfurther this effort. It is evident from the research and the analysis presented above that the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical companies and the TRIPS Agreement are not, inthemselves, impediments to the availability of HIV/AIDS therapies in sub-SaharanAfrica; and it is clearly incorrect to assume that without restrictions imposed by theWTO through TRIPS and without patents, HIV/AIDS patients would have access todrugs crucial to their survival. With such an enormous and impacting crisis as this,attention should properly be directed to the real factors constraining the availabilityof and access to these drugs in these countries. 82 Id.

Recommendations 5.1 Changing Perceptions 5.1.1 WIPO should undertake a project to determine, definitively, the patent status of all HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa Despite evidence that the TRIPS Agreement and patent protections generally do not block access to medicines in sub-Saharan Africa, there is, nevertheless a widespreadperception that this is the case. Activists and the pharmaceutical industry haveengaged in strong rhetoric that has failed in many cases to enlighten the debate onaccess to medicines and, rather, has led to distrust, accusation and counter-accusation. It is the IIPI's view that WIPO is in a unique position to help elucidate the actual situation with regard to the role that the TRIPS Agreement and patents play withregard to access to HIV/AIDS drugs. WIPO may be in the best position todefinitively determine, for example, the patent status of all of the HIV/AIDS drugs inthe countries of sub-Saharan Africa. While the IIPI has made earnest attempts todetermine patent status, it has only done so with regard to anti-retroviral drugs, andthen with the caveats presented in this report. WIPO has developed excellent working relationships with patent offices around the globe, it has highly skilled staff to undertake the analysis, and it has the internationalcredibility to definitively speak to this subject. Despite all of the complexitiesinvolved, such as the shortcomings in electronic databases and inadequate staff insome patent offices, WIPO should be able to accomplish this project successfully.As noted in a later recommendation, \"Enhanced WIPO Collaboration\", thisundertaking could prove to be very useful to international efforts to competitivelyprocure HIV/AIDS medications in sub-Saharan Africa. 5.1.2 Interpreting TRIPS With regard to the role that the TRIPS Agreement itself plays in this area, WIPO is in a more difficult position to address this problem. First, WIPO is constrainedsomewhat by the fact that it does not have the \"authority\" to interpret the TRIPSAgreement, since only the WTO has the final word on what particular provisionsmean. Furthermore, in giving legal advice to countries, WIPO rightfully maintainsconfidentiality, akin to a lawyer-client relationship. WIPO, nonetheless, can play an important role in helping to change perceptions regarding the role of the TRIPS Agreement with regard to access to medicines.First, although interpretation of the TRIPS Agreement is not clear in every respect, inmost areas the agreement is quite clear, such as the transition periods, the meaning ofmost of the compulsory licensing provisions and the permissible exceptions to patentrights (e.g., permitting the so-called \"Bolar\" exemption). Second, the \"TRIPS-plus\"56policies of some governments have given way to recognition of permissible flexibility to address health crises. WIPO should not shy away from making thisflexibility clear where appropriate.575.2 TRIPS Implementation - Model Legislation and Training In advising African countries on TRIPS and their patent legislation, WIPO should point out the flexibility provided by the TRIPS agreement outlined in Chapter 3 ofthis report. While \"Bolar\"-type exceptions to patent rights, compulsory licensingand parallel importation are perfectly legitimate under international rules, they maynot achieve the desired effect absent adequate financing of health care infrastructuregenerally, and the specific prerequisites outlined by the WHO and dealt with above,being put into place. The IIPI continues to believe that a model based on tiered pricing and prohibition of parallel imports would better serve the most needy countries. Structured programs,such as the pilot UNAIDS Drug Access Initiative, provide strong inducements fornot only drug price reductions, but also for necessary investment in health careinfrastructure to avoid diversion of drugs to the black market and the introduction ofcounterfeit and substandard drugs. This model also contemplates training of healthcare staff and patients to lessen the possibility that a drug resistant HIV strain willemerge. The European Commission notes that \"[e]xperience with vaccines and contraceptives demonstrates that significant price differentials can be achieved between prices indeveloped and developing countries\", and endorses this approach, while warning that\"[s]uch initiatives should be carefully monitored to ensure that scarce public financesthat target prevention and services for the poorest and the many are not diverted tonon-curative treatment for the few.\" 84 The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America explains its rationalefor differential pricing: \"Having differential prices for pharmaceutical products makes them available to more consumers, at lower prices, than would be possibleif only one price were permitted. When there are different pricesacross markets (e.g., lower prices in developing countries),manufacturers can maximize overall output and serve all markets.This benefits both developing countries (by increasing availability ofproducts) and developed ones (by lowering prices through economiesof scale).\" 85 84 Ibid at p. 12. 85 Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Frequently Asked Questions, \"Why do different people pay different prices for the same pharmaceutical product?\" (at http://world.phrma.org/faq.html585.3 Enhanced WIPO Collaboration WIPO should actively engage in the international debates on access to HIV/AIDS medicines with other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. WIPOis recognized for its expertise in intellectual property matters, and has excellentrelationships with its member states and industry. In compiling a definitive list of the patent status of HIV/AIDS drugs, WIPO would be in the best position to assist procurement efforts of governments, internationalorganizations and other purchasers. WIPO should also contemplate the establishment of a joint WIPO-WHO consultative mechanism to ensure that both health and intellectual property experts are involvedin the debates concerning access to drugs.59 6.

Definitions and Terminology \"Bolar\" Exception: an exception to the patent rights that permits the use of a patented drug for testing purposes for submission of test datarequired by regulatory authorities. Compulsory license: a license granted by the government to itself or a third party to practice an invention without the permission of the patentowner, usually on grounds of public interest, nationalemergency, or anti-competitive behavior by the patent owner. Generic drug: a pharmaceutical product that is not protected by a patent, and which is usually introduced after the expiration of patent orother exclusive rights. Parallel imports: products imported from another country, without the permission of the patent owner, when those products havebeen sold in other markets by the patent owner or his/herlicensee. Patent: a right granted by the government to an innovator to exclude others from practicing the invention for a limited time (20years from filing the application) in exchange for fulldisclosure of the invention, which leads to future innovation.
