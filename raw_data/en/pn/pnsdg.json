Does it work? For people who struggle with a [drug or alcohol addiction](/drugs/), choosing to seek professional care is the first step in the right direction. The next step for most is to enroll in a medically assisted detox program, which lays the foundation needed for continued healing from addiction. What Is Medical Detox? [Medically assisted detoxification](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64119/), or medical detox, is often the critical first step of any effective addiction treatment plan. Detox helps people cleanse their bodies of all traces of [drugs](/treatments/medically-assisted-detox/drug/) and [alcohol](/treatments/medically-assisted-detox/alcohol/), giving them a fresh foundation on which to build their recovery. Because detox is the most [physically and mentally demanding](https://journals.healio.com/doi/abs/10.3928/02793695-20210816-02) level of addiction care, most rehab facilities in Washington state aim to ensure each patient is well supported and as comfortable as possible during this challenging treatment phase. Most medical detox programs include: - 24-hour clinical care - Individual counseling sessions - Medication management, if necessary - Nutritious meals - Comfortable, quiet resting spaces Withdrawal symptoms that occur during the detox process can make this phase of recovery uncomfortable. For this reason, at-home detoxes and cold-turkey approaches can be very unpleasant. Enrolling in a medically assisted detox program can help ensure a safer, more comfortable withdrawal process because patients receive ongoing support from clinical staff. Who Needs Medical Detox Care? Most people who struggle with a drug or alcohol use disorder and want to begin professional rehab should first complete [medical detox](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK310652/). At most facilities, including The Recovery Village Ridgefield, detox programs come before all other treatment levels because they allow clients to start rehab treatment fresh, without traces of drugs or alcohol in their bodies. Medical detox is especially important for people who have used drugs or alcohol for an extended period of time. Their bodies will likely be dependent on the effects of these substances, and depending on the severity of their addiction and the type of substance they use, their withdrawal symptoms can be life-threatening. Medically assisted detox can be life-saving for people with long-term addictions involving: - Alcohol: [Alcohol withdrawal](/drugs/alcohol/withdrawal-detox/)is one of the most dangerous types of withdrawal, so medical detox is normally recommended. - Prescription and illicit [opioids](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000949.htm): aids: Such as [Ambien](/drugs/ambien/withdrawal-detox/), Lunesta or Halcion Some of these substances are prescribed to manage chronic pain or treat mental health disorder symptoms. However, due to the habit-forming nature of these drugs, they may prove more harmful than helpful. Individuals who feel that they can't stop using these types of drugs can greatly benefit from medical detox at an accredited facility like The Recovery Village Ridgefield. What To Expect During Medical Detox The Recovery Village Ridgefield understands that each client has a unique set of mental and physical needs. These are accounted for before treatment even begins, and care plans are carefully customized to fit every individual's personal situation. Treatment begins with a thorough physical and psychological assessment upon arrival at the rehab facility. Once in detox care, withdrawal symptoms are managed for as long as necessary \u2014 usually for five to seven days or longer, depending on the client's needs. After people have spent sufficient time in detox, they will have cleansed their bodies of drugs or alcohol, be medically stable and show no signs of life-threatening withdrawal. They can then transition to a less intensive level of care, such as a [residential](/treatments/residential-treatment/) or [partial hospitalization program](/treatments/partial-hospitalization-program/). Initial Assessment Upon arrival at the center, clients sit down with clinical staff for an initial evaluation. The results of this assessment inform each client's course of treatment. This evaluation helps doctors, nurses and counselors understand the intensity of each client's addiction so they can provide appropriate assistance. The intake assessment may include components like: - Drug and alcohol screening - Co-occurring mental disorder evaluation - Medical assessment - Psychological profile - Risk assessment Medical Detox Treatment Process When the evaluation is complete, clients can begin treatment at [The Recovery Village Ridgefield Detox Center](/locations/detox-center/) \u2014 a facility devoted solely to state-of-the-art detox care. In medical detox, clients receive 24-hour clinical support from a team of doctors, addiction specialists and counselors. Clients can also benefit from individual counseling sessions during detox if they struggle with [co-occurring mental disorders](/treatments/co-occurring-disorders/) like depression or anxiety. Almost immediately after the detox process begins, withdrawal symptoms and drug cravings can set in. [Side effects of withdrawal](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0733862720302637) can range from mild (headache, irritability, mood swings) to severe (vomiting, muscle tension, tremors), depending on the intensity of the addiction. Clinical staff closely monitor these symptoms to ensure each client's safety, and they may administer specific medications to ease uncomfortable side effects. Detox care ends after a client has completely cleansed their body of substances and is physically and mentally stable. After completing detox, clients can take advantage of the full continuum of care at The Recovery Village Ridgefield.
