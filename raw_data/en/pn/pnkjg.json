It provides a forum for new thinking, stronger partnerships, growth-oriented investments, and an incubator for new initiatives to bolster economic growth in Central New York. Success in this process has put the region ahead of the curve in implementing investments in strategic priorities, growing well-paying industries, driving innovation and entrepreneurship, preparing business for a globally competitive economy and expanding market opportunities, cultivating civic trust to ensure civic engagement in decision making, and encouraging economic mobility within the region and across the state. To further these efforts, the council is recommending 36 projects this year that will put people to work, increase economic competitiveness or businesses and the region, and transform the landscape of our communities while advancing the strategic objectives of our action plan. These projects represent a total proposed state investment of $26.6 million, leveraging $203.1 million in private and other funding for total project expenses of nearly $230 million, and a five-year total payroll of more than $98.9 million. Together, they support the creation of 894 new jobs, the retention of 90 existing jobs, and leverage a return on investment of 12.3. These priority projects are selected because they accomplish multiple goals and strategies, advance the region's Transformational Initiatives, and leverage the greatest return on investment\u2014in terms of dollars, jobs, human capital, and community impact\u2014to stimulate economic growth across five counties. Beyond the projects, 2014 also presents our region with several opportunities to advance new and ongoing projects as they align with statewide priorities. Central New York is leading the way on many of the Regional Priorities laid out by Governor Andrew Cuomo in this REDC round. Goals and strategies established in Central New York's Five-Year Strategic Plan already support many of these priorities: Global NY - Through efforts begun in 2011, Central New York is taking an active role to enhance its connections to the global marketplace. The region has already seen its efforts pay off in a shifting culture of its businesses toward exporting. As we move forward, Central New York and the Mohawk Valley are proposing a joint strategy to engage with New York State and the global economy as part of the Global NY initiative. Veterans - There is no other region of the U.S. better positioned to support and advance opportunities for veterans in the civilian workforce than Central and Upstate New York. The region is home to an extraordinary network of resources, supportive services, and workforce training initiatives, focused specifically on advancing veterans in the workforce. Working in cooperation with Syracuse University's Institute for Veterans and Military Families, the region is focusing on the ongoing integration of veterans into our entrepreneurial ecosystem, workforce development, and small business support systems. Local Government Collaboration - A diverse coalition of business leaders, local government officials, community groups, and academic institutions convened a local government modernization commission, known as Consensus, to perform a comprehensive study of government structure in Onondaga County. As one of the first comprehensive efforts in New York State, Consensus will ultimately serve as a resource for lessons learned and best practices that can inform action models for other communities across the region and state. Opportunity Agenda - We are successfully executing our strategies to connect those living in poverty with skilled employment, expand training opportunities for chronically underserved populations, and help distressed communities overcome barriers to economic success with the launch of Work Train. NY Rising Community Reconstruction Plan - Madison County is rebuilding after devastating flooding in a thoughtful, sustainable, and proactive manner. Project Pipeline - Through the first three rounds, the Central New York REDC demonstrated a best-in-class track record for leveraging investment, providing a strong return on investment, and successfully completing the projects that we have started. Eighty-three of our Rounds 1-3 projects are underway or are on schedule. Collectively, the $230 million awarded to CNY in Rounds 1-3 has the potential to leverage more than $1 billion in private investments. The CNY REDC continues its commitment to working with current project sponsors to ensure project success, while increasing awareness among businesses of the opportunities and benefits of the REDC process. Collectively, these efforts are improving the regional business climate in Central New York. In the process, our region is garnering national recognition for the initiatives and policies it is advancing to confront persistent economic challenges. Due to the region's forward-thinking approach to transforming our economy, indifferent to geographic and organizational borders, the council witnessed significant success on initiatives that stand to have a significant impact in the region: In late 2013, NUAIR won designation to open one of six UAS testing sites in the country. Since that time it has built a pipeline of companies interested in testing new technologies in Central New York and the Mohawk Valley. After years of limited venture capital available in the region, Armory Square Ventures closed on its first capital call in May 2014. The group is now vetting its first round of investments to be announced in the fall. The Greater Syracuse Property Development Corporation, a New York State Land Bank, began accepting foreclosed properties from the City of Syracuse and Onondaga County in 2013. To date, it has acquired 337 properties; sold 42; and hired an executive director, property renovation and maintenance manager, and a special projects coordinator. STRATEGIC PLAN UPDATE: 2014-2015 1 And yet, we remain acutely focused on our challenges. Though the region's unemployment rate is at its lowest point in four years, job growth remains behind many other regions in the state. Further, the region is experiencing historic lows in its total labor force, which may lead to shortages among businesses looking for talented employees. Finally, poverty rates are a persistently troubling figure. While the nation as a whole struggles to provide new opportunities and support systems for the long-term poor, poverty, especially in our rural and center city neighborhoods, is an issue that cannot be ignored. Project challenges are also a key focus. The council is committed to helping projects succeed, but it is also willing to change course when faced with unexpected setbacks or missed deadlines. Throughout this time, though, the council has maintained a steadfast commitment to accountability in its role as a steward of state funding and advocate for project success.These pioneering solutions, together with transformative projects and ongoing guidance from the council, are creating a new Central New York. For the past three years, we have encouraged rebuilding our municipal centers and have accomplished that by repurposing historical buildings, creating new streetscapes, and continuing to see new businesses and residents choose to locate in our downtowns. We have discussed plans for investing in our core industries, which we have done by expanding health care services beyond the region and more closely integrating the advanced manufacturing and clean energy sectors. We have strategized to become more competitive in a global marketplace, and have launched new venture capital funds to transition the region's work in research and development into homegrown businesses. So far, our productive partnership with New York State is enabling us to tackle the daunting challenges inherent to the revitalization of Central New York. Your continued confidence, support, and guidance are critical to our region's transformation.

As the economy regrouped from losses felt during the Great Recession, CNY faced tough choices about what will drive sustained growth into the future. With the leadership of the Regional Economic Development Council, and a team of businesses, governments, and institutions, Central New York is transforming its economic development plans, priorities, and promises. At its inception in 2011, the Central New York Regional Economic Development Council (CNY REDC) declared in its Five-Year Strategic Plan that its economy would propel itself forward by focusing on three fundamental goals: This 2014-2015 Strategic Plan Update continues to rely on these goals to guide its investments and foster collaborations among regional partners. By building consensus around a common plan, the region is seeing significant progress on projects both in and outside of the REDC process. Within the framework of these goals, the CNY REDC is also: Integrating new regional and state priorities; Advancing Transformational Initiatives to achieve long-term prosperity, and evaluating progress to identify successes and determine where more work is needed; Identifying performance measures - quantifiable objectives tracking direct council influence, highlighting CNY's strategic priorities, and measuring actions on the ground; Advocating for policies that improve the regional business climate, including government modernization, increasing awareness of the benefits the REDC process may confer on small businesses, expanding training opportunities for chronically underserved populations, and streamlining incubation and commercialization efforts; and Pursuing opportunities for cross-regional collaboration.Leveraging Investments The success of the CNY REDC's strategic plan would not be possible without support from a variety of sources, including private-sector investment, competitive federal programs, foundation funding, and other community resources. Projects and initiatives supporting the plan that leverage resources outside of the REDC process are noted throughout the report. Completed Projects Completed projects and the launch of key initiatives are tangible evidence of the CNY REDC's plan in action and are noted throughout the report with this icon. Interregional Collaboration The council continues to prioritize projects and initiatives that transcend geographic boundaries. These initiatives are creating greater opportunity across regions, and are noted throughout the report. Strengthen Targeted Industry Concentrations that Leverage Unique Economic Assets Improve Competitiveness in, and Connections to, Regional, National, and Global Economies Revitalize our Region's Urban Cores, Main Streets, and Neighborhoods Part 1 | OVERVIEW OF PROGRESS 7 At the same time, the council continues to treat its Strategic Plan as an evolving action plan, rather than a static document. As in past years, the CNY REDC will continue to adapt to changing community needs, diligently manage project and policy implementation, and devote personnel and resources to push strategies forward. By leveraging assets in the region's most competitive industries, growing the region's global competitiveness, and emphasizing human capital and anchor institutions as resources to develop strong neighborhoods and communities, the CNY REDC is actively implementing its goals and strategies. Strategy progress, along with that of related REDC priority and other regional projects, is summarized below. Growing the Central New York economy is an intricate and complicated task. The strategic planning process is forcing CNY to face its economic future, evaluate growth potential based on true market opportunities, and shed preconceptions of the community's strengths. v Strategy: Invest in Regional Industry Concentrations and Businesses The seven concentrations below represent sectors in the Central New York economy that have the greatest potential to grow in the global marketplace. To date, the council has prioritized the investment of more than $80 million, advancing projects within these concentrations. Careful analysis of current markets, available workforce, educational expertise, and future global and domestic demand shows that these industries are where CNY can differentiate itself and make good on the promise of securing success. 1. A dvanced Manufacturing in Thermal and Environmental Control Systems (AM-TEC) As the region continues to refine the Clean Energy and Environmental Systems (CEES) sector and global demand for environmental products intensifies, the CNY REDC is focused on the emerging Clean Energy sub-concentration know as AM-TEC. In Central New York the concentration of AM-TEC firms is nearly twice the national average. The ongoing work of the AM-TEC collaboration is strengthening the cluster of Central New York manufacturers building systems that heat and cool buildings, refrigerate produce, and control manufacturing processes.Central New York is also a leader in green building innovation as well as practice. Scaled on population, the intensity of LEED projects (per capita) in CNY is four times higher than in any other region in the state. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation Fulton Companies (Round 1) - U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez visited the Fulton Companies, an AM-TEC participating company, for a tour of its Oswego County facility and meetings with local officials. Perez also announced the new $150 million Ready to Work grant program during his visit. Fulton is a global manufacturer of high-efficiency, custom- engineered industrial and commercial heating systems and is expanding its facility in Central New York to serve markets overseas, despite also having facilities in Europe and Asia. It has steadily increased employment from 221 to 320 since 2009 and has benefited from AM-TEC workforce training HealthWay Home Products, Inc. (Round 1) is moving forward with its $900,000 project to construct and equip an 18,000-square-foot addition to the company's manufacturing facility in Pulaski. The manufacturer of air purification equipment will create 10 jobs above its target of 42 jobs for a previous ESD grant. The Village of Skaneateles (Round 2) completed renovation of a vacant fire station into a LEED-certified, net zero combined village and town municipal building. Lime Hollow Nature Center (Round 2), in Cortland County, in collaboration with Onondaga-Cortland-Madison BOCES (OCM BOCES), is finishing construction of an education center that includes a LEED-certified classroom to train teachers and conservation leaders. The BOCES New Vision Environmental Science High School and Lime Hollow Nature Center will share use of the facility. Strengthen Targeted Industry Concentrations that Leverage Unique Economic Assets AM-TEC Initiative 8 regional partners 37 firms engaged 8,500 employees represented8 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL 2. H ealth, Biomedical Services, and Biosciences Exemplary health care institutions, industry-leading manufacturers, and cutting-edge academic research are the backbone of this industry concentration. The CNY Biotech Accelerator is now a partner in the CNY Innovation Hot Spot and a site for the START- UP NY program. This, along with a new initiative to drive medical tourism, is creating more demand for the space and services for startups and mature bioscience firms alike. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation Hanford Pharmaceuticals (Round 3), of Syracuse, is expanding its manufacturing operations in the City of Syracuse to include the production of a new product line in 36,000 square feet of manufacturing and clean room space. Community Memorial Hospital (Round 2), in Hamilton, recently completed information technology upgrades to facilitate connections with Crouse Hospital in Syracuse. The upgrade allows the hospitals to share patient data through a document imaging system, resulting in better coordination of patient care. St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center (Round 1) in Syracuse opened its new operating room suite in 2013. Completion of a new six-story, nearly 200,000-square-foot patient tower is expected this year. St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center has utilized its REDC funding to open a new operating room suite and complete a new six-story patient tower. Strategy Implementation in 2014 - 2015 The New York Energy Regional Innovation Cluster (NYE-RIC) Transformational Initiative Team, composed of partners within the AM-TEC cluster, is working to strengthen connections between companies and universities; leverage exceptional assets for research, development, demonstration, and commercialization; and increase exports of Central New York products and services to major markets by leveraging the work of Global NY. The NYE-RIC team will focus on the following five areas to advance this important business cluster in the region: Leverage statewide energy initiatives by bringing together project sponsors that are building clean energy facilities across the state with product and service providers in Central New York. Promote resilience solutions through the research, development and deployment of new building technologies and services to help communities, home and abroad, respond to natural disasters. Iden tify, promote and implement projects that showcase products made in CNY and advance the Vision CNY Regional Sustainability Plan. Attract new, targeted businesses through efforts that leverage the START-UP NY, Innovation Hot Spot, and Global NY initiatives. Advocate for policy changes to remove barriers in key areas, including property tax reform and modernizing public service laws and regulations. Part 1 | OVERVIEW OF PROGRESS 9 3. Financial Services Building off its solid foundation as a strong driver of regional employment, financial services also represent a key business attraction opportunity for the region. Central New York is a competitive location for back office financial and insurance services. Low-cost commercial real estate, a skilled workforce, and proximity to major financial centers draw large financial services firms to the regions. A multibillion-dollar bank is considering Central New York for an expansion. Several local partners with significant back office operations met with the organization to discuss workforce, hiring successes and challenges, and various approaches to finding talent. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation 706 North Clinton, LLC (Round 3) is completing a 37,500-square-foot redevelopment of an existing building at the entrance to Syracuse's Inner Harbor and Franklin Square neighborhoods. Anchor tenants include insurance brokers Bailey & Haskell Associates and Oneida Preferred Funding Corporation. 4. A gribusiness and Food Processing Central New York's agriculture heritage, long a vital sector of the economy, is burgeoning as locally sourced products, agritourism, and advanced food manufacturing techniques transform the industry. Food processing is also a key recent focus of many foreign direct investments from Canada. The council's Food to Market Transformational Initiative Team is identifying the gaps in the region's agriculture supply chain and the existing framework of how food is grown, distributed, and sold in Central New York. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation Ariston Dairy Products (Round 3) is renovating and equipping a 72,000-square-foot building in Canastota. The facility will manufacture strained Greek yogurt and feta cheese and create approximately 95 new jobs over the next five years. Byrne Dairy and its affiliate C'Ville Caf\u00e9 (Round 3) are building an agritourism destination in Cortland County, which will include a retail store, caf\u00e9, and tours of the adjacent yogurt and cheese manufacturing facility. Cayuga Milk Ingredients (Round 1) is now operating in its expanded 108,000-square-foot facility, producing a variety of products including pasteurized cream, whole and skim milk powder, condensed milk, and non-fat dry milk. Cazenovia College received funds in Round 3 to support its New York State Center for Equine Business Development degree program. In New York State, equine-related businesses now account for $2 billion of annual economic activity and the industry supports approximately $169 million in annual wages. Strategy Implementation in 2014 - 2015 Moving forward, the Agriculture and Food to Market Transformational Initiative Team will create measurements to understand the local and regional food system with the goal of advancing opportunities to fill leakage points and maximize the potential of farmers, ranchers, and food producers. Strengthening the regional economy and creating a brand value for the region's agricultural industry are the team's priorities in the next year. To accomplish these goals, the team will: Support initiatives to increase connections among farmers, ranchers, producers, buyers, and distributors; Create a process for producers and buyers to understand what the needs are within the region, provide technical assistance where appropriate to build connections or develop new products; and Develop metrics that will allow the committee to better understand the outcomes of these efforts. Cayuga Milk Ingredients' wet processing room with pasteurized product storage is part of the upgrades supported by its CNY REDC funding.10 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL 5. Tourism Arts, culture, and history define Central New York and the experiences they generate make the region a compelling place to live and visit. Hotel occupancy in the region is up, new entertainment and dining options are popping up in urban centers, and new way-finding signage from New York State makes it easier than ever to find hidden gems. The Tourism, Arts and Culture Transformational Initiative Team is organizing regional strategies related to the interconnected worlds of tourism and the arts. Developing, expanding, enhancing, and marketing the region's arts and tourism assets will maximize the region's economic growth through visitor and resident spending and job creation. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation CNY Arts, the region's arts and culture council, received awards in Rounds 2 and 3 to build out its joint marketing system with the Syracuse Convention and Visitors Bureau (SCVB) and conduct a regional assessment of arts and culture demand in Central New York and the Mohawk Valley. To maximize the visibility of the CNY Arts cultural calendar, the SCVB distributes the information to various kiosks located at high tourist traffic areas (e.g., Syracuse Hancock International Airport, Destiny USA) and the Downtown Committee of Syracuse website, where applicable. Information from the system will send arts, cultural, and heritage information to various kiosks along Syracuse's Connective Corridor. CNY Arts also feeds information to the new auburn- arts.com highlighting Auburn- based events. The Onondaga Historical Association (Round 3) is repurposing a facility in Liverpool, Onondaga County, to house a Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Nation) heritage museum. The Erie Canal Museum (Round 2) and the Village of Baldwinsville launched a \"History Happens Here: Beeline to B'ville\" project highlighting intertwined history of the village and Erie Canal through the use of signage and interactive QR codes linking to web-based exhibits.6. A dvanced Manufacturing CNY has a long history of being part of the global value chain and its manufacturers thrived by diversifying ahead of some of the macroeconomic forces that hit the region hard. During this transition, new customers in military, technology, and commercial markets filled the void created by plant closings and the Great Recession. To maintain CNY manufacturing's reputation for productivity and precision, continued investment is necessary. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation INFICON (Round 3), a manufacturer of vacuum instrumentation, critical sensor technologies, and process control software for the semiconductor industry, began a $20 million expansion of its plant in DeWitt in the summer of 2014. TRW Automotive (Round 3), an Auburn manufacturer of remote door and tire pressure sensors, is upgrading its facility to accommodate new equipment for an expanded product line. The project will add 12 new jobs at the firm, which has 357 workers. INFICON Inc. is adding 40 new jobs at its facility in DeWitt. In 2013, with the assistance of 7 regional IDAs, CNY companies invested more than $600 million in capital projects. Strategy Implementation in 2014 - 2015 To create strategic alignments between the region's arts and cultural providers and the tourism industry, the Tourism, Arts and Culture Transformational Initiative Team identified the following goals for the next year: Support and encourage investment in the development, promotion, and preservation of the cultural, artistic, recreational, historical, wine, culinary, and retail assets of the region; Leverage resources, partnerships, and promotions of the region's tourism and arts assets for the long-term economic growth of the region; Create an inclusive network of tourism and arts advocates that can provide valuable input from all five counties in the CNY REDC region; Increase regional travel spending through implementation of a comprehensive, emotionally connected branding program; Develop a comprehensive tourism plan that addresses marketing and product development needs; and Connect regional tourism and arts/cultural providers to expanded versions of regional marketing programs such as the CNY Arts online calendar. Part 1 | OVERVIEW OF PROGRESS 11 Dielectric Laboratories Inc. (Round 2) is in the process of relocating a sister company's operations from California and consolidating at its Cazenovia facility. Southern Graphic Systems (Round 3) is expanding in the Oswego County Industrial Park in Schroeppel by adding new production machinery and equipment to expand its capacity to manufacture printing engravings. The $2.2 million investment will create 6 and retain 26 jobs. 7. D ata to Decisions During a comprehensive analysis of the region's economy, Central New York identified cross-industry strength in sensing, signal processing, cyber-security, systems integration and engineering, data mining, predictive analytics and decision support: Data to Decisions (D2D). Globally, various markets for these products are expected to expand by more than $150 billion over the next five years.v Strategy: Encourage Cross-Industry Collaboration The continued growth of Central New York's seven key industry sectors relies upon constant collaboration and reinvention. The region has a strong track record of utilizing cross-industry and cross-regional collaborations to pursue growth opportunities and penetrate new markets. Current collaborations, particularly those involving agritourism, NUAIR, D2D, and the AM-TEC sector, are advancing opportunities that can benefit all businesses in the region. The council continues to promote collaboration among leading businesses, partners across the state, and other regional resources to increase the total amount of cluster businesses participating in growth and innovation activities. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation Medical Tourism - CenterState CEO, the University Hill Corporation, the SCVB, and medical institutions and physician groups in the region are studying the potential for medical tourism from Canada. The studies will identify new international opportunities and evaluate the market for medical services, categorize the capabilities of Syracuse suppliers, and analyze the impact of medical tourism on other markets in New York. Also, The Tech Garden opened an Executive Wellness Center to advance prospects for medical tourism for Chinese business executives through its partnership with the China Association for Promotion of Private Sci-Tech Enterprises (CAPPSTE). Healthy Shoppers Rewards Program- A collaboration of St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center, Syracuse University, and Nojaim Brothers Supermarket is transforming public health and delivering local produce to one of the region's poorest neighborhoods, Syracuse's Near Westside. The Healthy Shoppers Rewards Program scores food items in the supermarket, with healthier items receiving the highest scores. Rewards Programs members use the collected points they earn by eating healthier for items such as YMCA memberships or bicycles, creating a powerful incentive to try healthier products. In conjunction, St. Joseph's Primary Care Center-West (Round 1) works with shoppers to develop eating plans to improve the patient's health. TRW Automotive is upgrading its facility in Auburn to accommodate an expanded product line. Strategy Implementation in 2014 - 2015 To better capture these opportunities and drive new innovations in these firms, a D2D Innovation Alliance of industry and university partners is refining the concept to put a sharper focus on the research area. The alliance will proceed to better define the mission, goals, structure, and financing. The alliance plans to retain a consultant to build a prospectus for investors and lead the alliance's initial work. A delegation from the China Association for Promotion of Private Sci-Tech Enterprises tours facilities at SUNY Upstate Medical University.12 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL Driving Progress: NUAIR An emerging, cross-regional cluster is developing out of the Northeast UAS Airspace Integration Research Alliance (NUAIR), headquartered in Syracuse. In 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) selected Griffiss International Airport, in Rome, and the NUAIR Alliance as one of six test sites to conduct research and development necessary to meet a congressional mandate to safely integrate Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) into the National Airspace System (NAS) by 2015. The NUAIR Alliance will conduct UAS testing at several locations in New York and Massachusetts and will begin test site operations in 2014. The Griffiss/NUAIR team will play a leading role among the six test sites in expanding civil and commercial UAS capabilities. NUAIR Alliance academic partners have also formalized an academic consortium committed to developing the technological and policy education and training to support the FAA's mission of UAS integration into the NAS. Additionally, the NUAIR Alliance and Griffiss International Airport are working with Mohawk Valley Community College to develop training program for civil and commercial UAS operators. NUAIR has engaged 40 organizations and 60 business prospects, and has submitted 6 Certificate of Authorization applications to the FAA. Potential Economic Impact 2014-2017 Economic ImpactJob ImpactTax $4,409,293 v Strategy: Attract Outside Investment and Interest A key component to attracting investment and interest is effectively marketing the resources and qualities that make Central New York an ideal place to live and work. The community must leverage the marketing work done on the state level and be prepared for increased attention on our local assets. Round 1- Project & Strategy Implementation START-UP NY is bringing new businesses to Central New York and changing the way the national and international business communities view New York State, and Upstate in particular. Institutions are reaching out in their areas of specialty to interested businesses, and several have met with and are negotiating with tenants who can become the initial investors under the START-UP NY program. In addition, The Tech Garden is Central New York's designated Innovation Hot Spot and the Hot Spot Council is coordinating the activities of 21 regional incubators. Six of the region's higher education institutions have submitted plans identifying buildings and land resources that could be made available to private companies. Four campuses have approved START-UP NY Plans: 1. Onondaga C ommunity College (SUNY OCC) has designated 72 acres of vacant land on its campus. The school is targeting businesses that support core industry clusters included in the Central New York Regional Economic Development Council's strategic plan, such as clean energy and environmental systems, health, biomedical services and biosciences, agribusiness and food processing, advanced manufacturing, and tourism. 2. SUN Y Morrisville has designated 344.22 acres of vacant campus land (on campus) and 12,258.5 square feet of vacant campus space. The college will target businesses involved with agriculture, food processing technology, bio-energy and equine studies. Part 1 | OVERVIEW OF PROGRESS 13 3. SUN Y Upstate Medical University designated 172,300 square feet of vacant campus space and 21.86 acres of vacant campus land in Syracuse. The school will target businesses in the health and life sciences involved with developing health care-related IT, medical devices, therapeutic compounds, diagnostics, biologics, research instruments, or any other type of biomedical innovation. 4. SUN Y Oswego designated more than nine acres of land and 10,500 square feet of office space as part of its START-UP NY plan. As part of its plan, SUNY Oswego will target advanced manufacturing, robotics, information technology, telecommunications, and electronics and computer software industries. Foreign Direct Investment - In 2015, CenterState CEO will work with the Brookings Institution's Metro Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) program. The program is designed to help cities and regions become more effective at attracting investment into their area by developing a sophisticated and comprehensive Foreign Direct Investment program. Understanding what community assets are attractive to foreign investors is key to expanding regional wealth and attracting outside investment. Transcontinental Relationships - CenterState CEO is taking a direct approach to outside investment and is developing a transcontinental relationship with CAPPSTE. Three delegations from China have traveled to Central New York and expressed a strong interest in the region's green and clean technology portfolio, including the Syracuse Center of Excellence (Syracuse CoE) at Syracuse University and Syracuse University's Green Data Center, as well as its health care institutions. CenterState CEO also sent a delegation to China in June 2013 to meet with 22 businesses and organizations to promote business opportunities in the CenterState region. Tourism - In tandem with direct business communication, for several years the Tourism, Arts and Culture Transformational Initiative Team has worked to expand tourism and regional visitation. The goal is to increase cultural tourism and help rebrand the region as a cultural tourism destination. In 2014, CNY Arts released the ENGAGE CNY Cultural Plan. The plan uses the assessment's data to inform its recommendations to better integrate culture into every community, improve the quality of life for all residents, and work with multiple partners to improve the overall livability and vitality of Central New York. Visitors from CAPPSTE unveil the International Wellness Center at The Tech Garden in Syracuse, with CenterState CEO's Rob Simpson and NYS Senator David Valesky.With CFA funding, CNY Arts conducted a 6-county regional assessment of arts and entertainment in 2013, hosting 50 forums and summits and collecting opinions of 8,000+ participants. The Syracuse Arts & Crafts Festival attracts more than 50,000 visitors each summer to downtown Syracuse.

Many of these efforts are receiving national attention and position Central New York as a leader in economic development best practices. v Strategy: Encourage New Venture and Product Development and Process Improvement The lasting legacy of Central New York's industrial past are the entrepreneurs building new, niche businesses using expertise gained working for corporate giants. In part due to the CNY REDC, the next generation of innovators will have the space, capital, and mentors necessary to grow and thrive in Central New York. Historically, Central New York was slow to adapt to changing economic realities; however, over the past decade partnerships between academic institutions and economic development organizations have built a nationally recognized entrepreneurial ecosystem. The designation of the CNY Hot Spot in 2013 and the subsequent development of the Hot Spot Council to coordinate entrepreneurial activities ensure that the region's resources are better aligned and more responsive than ever. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation Mentorship - Continuing to expand its entrepreneurial product offerings, The Tech Garden in Syracuse houses a standing Entrepreneur in Residence, a Marketing Executive in Residence, and a new Organizational Chart in Residence, creating a comprehensive mentorship network. Incubation space - Demand remains high for physical office space at The Tech Garden. This has triggered an expanded campus to an adjacent location. Tech Garden 2 opened in 2014. The Cortland Business Innovation Center has been remodeled to accommodate more robust entrepreneurship programming. Further, communities such as Auburn and Oswego are investigating the creation of their own co-working or incubation spaces. Technical Assistance - The CNY Innovation Hot Spot, designated in 2013, has 21 partners providing direct assistance to the startup companies, entrepreneurs and innovators. Startup labs, entrepreneur bootcamps, the PreSeed Workshop, Syracuse CoWorks, SALT Works, and The Clean Tech Center programs also offer technical assistance. Financing - Central New York is committed to providing companies of all sizes the resources they need at every stage of growth. This includes venture funding, business competition dollars, mezzanine level financing, and ultimately sales and property tax management programs. Critical to the growth of our businesses is quick access to financing. With the efforts of New York Business Development Corporation, the Greater Syracuse Business Development Corporation, and Operation Oswego County, the SBA has approved 77 504 and 7a loans worth more than $16 million to small business in the region between October 2013 and April 2014. Driving Progress: Venture Capital Fund The establishment of Armory Square Ventures (ASV) is a major success in the region's entrepreneurial support matrix. ASV, with significant support from the Innovate Upstate Transformational Initiative Team, is a new early-stage and venture fund targeting investment in New York State companies. ASV launched in mid-2014 with an initial capital call of $15 million and ultimately hopes to raise $40 million. The fund's launch achieves Innovate Upstate's primary purpose and closes a significant gap in capital infrastructure to support entrepreneurs and early-stage firms. By attracting private investment and new capital from outside of Central New York, the fund will provide new resources for homegrown entrepreneurs, development of early-stage companies, and the creation of the next generation of industries. The Clean Tech Center 33 companies served by the program 24 new products commercialized $17M in private capital raised by the portfolio Startup Labs Syracuse 8 companies in portfolio $1M + awarded to date Grants for Growth 50 business-university partnerships $2.7M awarded to date $5.5M in leveraged fundsImprove Competitiveness in, and Connections to, the Regional, National, and International Economies Part 1 | OVERVIEW OF PROGRESS 15 P rocess Support - Central New York is fortunate to have a tremendous resource in the CNY Technology Development Organization (CNY TDO), the NYSTAR designated Regional Technology Development Center, and the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) for Central New York. The CNY TDO provides audit support to manufacturers with existing ISO/AS/TS/HACCP and SQF systems. CNY TDO staff provides guidance on system design and QMS implementation to equip organizations to work efficiently and effectively with the appropriate certifying bodies. This program can significantly accelerate readiness for SME's to participate in \"Made In America\" supply chain initiatives, and supports export growth opportunities and new domestic manufacturing opportunities resulting from total cost analyses and identification of critical supply chains. v Strategy: Prioritize Investments in Research, Innovation, and Commercialization Central New York is making significant improvements in aligning and streamlining academic and private research and development. Central New York doesn't operate in a vacuum, as R&D activities in the North Country, Mohawk Valley, and Southern Tier complement work done at the SyracuseCoE at Syracuse University, Upstate Medical University, and the emerging CNY Hotspot. Syracuse University's Center for Advanced Systems and Engineering (CASE), a NYSTAR Center for Advanced Technology, works with small- and medium- sized businesses across the state to provide a broad range of expertise in areas impacting information technology, cybersecurity, and wireless communications. Additionally, Syracuse University leadership is prioritizing research excellence among its faculty and students. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation SUNY Upstate Cancer Center - Opened in July 2014, this $74 million facility will enhance SUNY Upstate's cancer patient care and research with state-of-the-art equipment. The 90,000-square-foot center boasts advanced radiation therapy that is available in only a few other facilities across the United States and an operating room directly integrated with MRI equipment. v Strategy: Capture a Greater Share of the Global Marketplace Before the REDC strategic planning process began in 2011, Central New York, in partnership with the Brookings Institution, studied the benefits to CNY companies of expanding their presence globally.Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation ExportNY - To increase total businesses participating in export assistance programs, the CNYIBA is now co-producing Central New York's innovative ExportNY program. The program provides hands-on training for businesses in the region and assists them in drafting an export development plan. ExportNY runs twice a year and expects to include 12 to 15 businesses each session. See Part Four for more on the CNY REDC's Global NY plan and strategies. Driving Progress: CNYIBA To improve the region's export performance to generate new net wealth and streamline existing export services in the region, the Central New York International Business Alliance (CNYIBA) was re- launched with an unveiling event that attracted 150 business executives in September 2013. Since its launch, the CNYIBA has conducted numerous outreach activities through presentations to stakeholder groups and individual meetings with more than 100 companies. Throughout this time it has assisted companies such as Morse Manufacturing, Giovanni Foods, Cayuga Milk Ingredients, and Rapid Cure Technologies with solutions ranging from connecting to financing sources, advising on export incentives, and helping navigate regulatory obstacles. The CNYIBA is seeing success in its initial efforts to streamline existing export assistance programs; the U.S. Department of Commerce saw an increase of referrals coming into its export support system, the majority of which are attributed to the efforts of the CNYIBA. The CNYIBA is also expanding its mentorship program by connecting local businesses to potential CNYIBA member-mentors. For example, the IBA is recruiting companies for a trade mission to bring new-to- market exporters and experienced mentors to Singapore and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations countries in 2014. Steven King, Executive Director of the CNYIBA The SUNY Upstate Medical Center opened its new $75million cancer treatment center in 2014. 16 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL v Strategy: Build a 21st-Century Infrastructure Improving physical infrastructure is a requirement for Central New York to continue its upward trajectory. Pipes and roads are only the beginning of a sophisticated infrastructure. The region's infrastructure connects workers to jobs, students to schools, visitors to attractions, and goods to markets. It is the backbone for lasting, successful economic development. To position itself for new investment and growth, Central New York must invest in its modern infrastructure needs, in addition to preserving and reusing its existing infrastructure . Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation Land Banks - With the assistance of the Ford Foundation and Center for Community Progress, Central New York led advocacy efforts at the state level to enact legislation enabling land banks. The Greater Syracuse Land Bank, one of the first five land banks approved by New York State, is developing a strategy to act as the conduit owner of historic properties in order for the community to take time to develop thoughtful and sustainable plans for the resources' preservation. Recently completed improvements to Syracuse Hancock International Airport and the Port of Oswego (Round 1) illustrate forward-thinking, holistic infrastructure improvement. Both the VISION CNY Cleaner Greener Plan , prepared by the Central New York Regional Planning and Development Board, and Onondaga County's Sustainable Development Plan prioritize the strategic adaptive reuse of existing infrastructure and buildings. For example, the Onondaga County Industrial Development Agency further incentivizes adaptive reuse in its Community Benefit Payment in Lieu of Tax schedule. Rail - The Phase I report of the Syracuse Transit System Analysis focused on the potential for the development of light transit or bus rapid transit to meet the needs of the community. Two priority routes identified would enhance links between University Hill, Downtown, Destiny USA, and the Syracuse Lakefront; and James Street, downtown Syracuse, and SUNY OCC. Broadband - The Broadband Investment Transformational Initiative Team leveraged funding support from New York State over the past several years to deploy affordable broadband access to underserved and unserved communities throughout Central New York. Broadband access is critical for Central New York's rural communities and urban cores to connect with educational and employment opportunities worldwide. In the next year the Broadband Transformational Initiative Team has been tasked with developing a 10-gig broadband attraction program. Interstate 81 - Currently, Central New York is in the middle of a thoughtful debate about the future of its major north/south highway, Interstate I-81. The ultimate decision on the viaduct through downtown Syracuse will shape the region's future economic growth and should consider the Interstate's role as a: Gateway and connector to the community; Driver of the economy by connecting workers to jobs, customers to shopping, students to school, and patients to care; and Facilitator of real estate development and urban revitalization. The Syracuse Hancock International Airport opened its new LEED Gold Certified passenger terminal in May 2013. The Port of Oswego is a critical component of CNY's transportation infrastructure. The future of Interstate I-81 through downtown Syracuse is a critical infrastructure issue currently being evaluated by stakeholders in the region. Part 1 | OVERVIEW OF PROGRESS 17 v Strategy: Maximize Human Capital Central New York's human infrastructure is equally important. With exemplary educational institutions, quality employers, and a renowned workforce, Central New York has the components of a great workforce system. Strategic investments in urban education systems, apprenticeship programs, and workforce alignment have made some inroads. In order to fully rebuild the region's employment base, Central New York must retain its highly educated young professionals and change the perception of career paths in advanced manufacturing. The intersection of workforce development systems, the Opportunity Agenda, and transitioning veterans to the civilian workforce presents Central New York with another opportunity to position itself as an innovative community maximizing opportunities for all its residents. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation Workforce Alignment - Improving the alignment of workforce supply and employer demand remains a council priority. Over the past year, much work has been done to push workforce alignment and training to the forefront of community discussions. For example, the Onondaga Citizens League's annual study is examining the workforce situation to determine what, if any, skills gap exists and how existing services are aligned. Veterans - Central New York is home to a large veteran population and has several world-class facilities dedicated to serving those who served their country. Critical to veteran success is connecting them with skills training to adapt their well-honed military skills for civilian careers. In 2014, New York State and the CNY REDC are refocusing on serving veterans, as outlined in the implementation section. See Part Five for the CNY REDC's strategies to support veterans in the workforce. v Strategy: Create and Support Apprenticeship Programs Many of Central New York's forecasted workforce needs are in positions where a base-level skill set is required for employment. Central New York community colleges and BOCES are terrific resources for high-quality, cost-effective training programs for workers of all ages and backgrounds. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation Training and Certification - MACNY (The Manufacturers Association of Central New York), SUNY OCC, OCM BOCES and SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF) are partnering to provide training and portable, industry-recognized certifications as machinist, welder, and product technician. SUNY OCC and MACNY are partners with SUNY in the process of implementing the National Association of Manufacturers' (NAM) Manufacturing Skills Certification System in Upstate New York. This system involves a statewide certification strategy that offers stackable credentials consistent with national standards as identified by the Manufacturing Institute, NAM, and guidance provided by the U.S. Department of Labor. The certification program is enrolling students for the fall 2014 semester at SUNY OCC. Salt Works is a social enterprise created in partnership with the Near West Side Initiative, Syracuse University, and Habitat for Humanity in which Near West Side neighborhood residents, and graduates of Northside UP's workforce training programs, create artisan furniture from reclaimed materials. The pilot program launched in September 2013. Strategy Implementation in 2014 - 2015 An advisory committee, the Next Generation Job Linkage Work Group (Appendix C), is identifying unmet workforce training needs and gaps in existing workforce development infrastructure. Throughout the past year, the group engaged area business leaders to identify recommendations for legislative action, funding priorities, and program development. A critical component is linking the next generation of workers to the careers and industries that will drive Central New York's economic success. For example, at least three different models exist for how county-based one-stops work with area colleges in Central New York's five counties. The team found that effective systems for matching businesses, training opportunities, and potential employees should be responsive to the speed of the business cycle; delivered through logical, easily navigated processes; and built upon engaged, responsive human relationships. It is critical to strengthen the relationships and infrastructure between each county's one-stop system and local college partner while coordinating broader regional effortsSalt Works installation at St. Joseph's Hospital 18 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL UP Start Syracuse is a pilot entrepreneurship program launched in fall 2013 to establish businesses within targeted districts in the City of Syracuse. The program, a partnership with The Tech Garden, Pro Literacy, SUNY EOC, Cooperative Federal Credit Union, Small Business Development Center and Catholic Charities of Onondaga County, is designed to help aspiring entrepreneurs overcome the barriers of starting a small business. Eighteen participants received business training from the SBDC Fast Track Program and the UP Start Seminar, provided by SUNY EOC and Cooperative Federal Credit Union. v Strategy: Attract and Retain Students and Young Professionals The influx of students from all over the country and around the world to Central New York's higher education institutions presents an opportunity to retain a new population. While Central New York still faces the challenge of retaining its college graduates and young professionals, several grassroots efforts are advancing to promote Central New York as a wonderful place to live.Driving Progress: Work Train Work Train puts Central New York's Opportunity Agenda in action by establishing a dual client workforce development platform in the region that serves the needs of both employers and job seekers. The platform is designed to adapt within different industries and across different skill levels. Work Train is truly collaborative, uniting leaders from business, economic development, philanthropy, workforce development, local government, training and education, and grassroots organizations. In the past year, local foundations have committed more than $1 million to launch Work Train over the next three years, along with state support. Work Train has also established Syracuse as a National Fund for Workforce Solutions partner community, which allows the program to access resources and technical assistance from National Fund expert staff; share best practices and network with other partner sites; and be eligible for philanthropic and federal funds that come to the National Fund. Driving Progress: Say Yes to Education In 2008, Syracuse University in partnership with the Say Yes to Education Foundation, formed a collaborative of public, private, and philanthropic institutions to create the first citywide chapter of Say Yes to Education, Inc. with the promise of a full tuition scholarship to more than 100 colleges and universities across the nation. After six years of programs and initiatives in support of that goal, the Say Yes to Education Collaborative is adapting to support new opportunities to continue its commitment to youth, higher education, and developing our region's workforce. The Collaborative supports the Syracuse City School District's implementation of vocational training on multiple levels, including the creation of a Public Service Leadership academy and continued collaboration with OCM BOCES. In addition, as part of its Summer Success Academy, Say Yes to Education is introducing students to methods of occupational planning and exposing them to available career choices. Utilizing a revised three-credit Vocational Comparative Planning course, all Summer Success Academy students have opportunities to strengthen educational and career goals in support of college completion and career entry. Students will also be introduced to specific career pathways in Central New York's priority industry clusters. Follow-up with each student will occur on their respective college campuses and will include strategies for making meaningful connections with mentors, career advisors, and local industries. Lt. Governor Duffy speaks with Loretto CEO Kim Townsend about its plans to hire 100 people utilizing Work Train. Students in the UP Start entrepreneurship program. Part 1 | OVERVIEW OF PROGRESS 19 Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation 40 Below offers programs supporting artists, community engagement, local commerce, and entrepreneurs. Citing a desire to help better connect college graduates to job opportunities in the region and promote sustainable transportation options, 40 Below recently launched two new task forces in 2014: the Career Connect and Transit Task Forces. The Student Sandbox, a partnership of The Tech Garden and 16 colleges and universities, gives aspiring student entrepreneurs a venue to accelerate the process of ideation, development, and deployment through mentoring and coaching. Participation in its program has grown steadily in recent years, with nearly 20 teams in its most recent cohort. Believe in Syracuse promotes Syracuse as a city on the rise and seeks to keep positive momentum going through marketing and communications. Believe in Syracuse utilizes grass roots community organizing to reach as many people as possible and give them opportunities to make a difference and become invested in their community. Regional Employment Resources and Internship Programs - EssentialNYJobs.com consolidates job postings from across the region to provide a one-stop shop for job seekers looking for detailed and up-to-date listings of opportunities. The site currently lists more than 10,000 job listings from Central New York employers. Additionally, Project-ION serves as a resource to network 200,000 college students at 48 colleges across 21 counties with internship opportunities in the region. Project-ION also focuses on engaging employers in the value of attracting and hosting the talent found at local colleges and universities through training programs with career services organizations. Municipal cores are the geographic nexus of commerce, education, culture, and humanity. Vibrant communities require exciting communal spaces. The dynamic revitalization of downtown Syracuse, Genesee Street in Auburn, the Oswego Harbor area, and downtown Cortland are evidence that a fundamental shift is happening in the way people choose to live, work, and play. The rehabilitation of Central New York's municipal cores' physical structures is bringing residents, retail businesses, and cultural events back to their historical homes.v Strategy: Leverage the Region's Exemplary Anchor Institutions Symbiotic relationships developing between neighborhoods and institutions are benefiting some of the region's largest employers and poorest citizens while leveraging municipal and private investment. New leadership at many anchor institutions presents CNY an opportunity for fresh thinking about the role the region's hospitals and universities play in community discussions of aesthetics, functionality, and access to the resources within them. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation Northside Urban Partnership has engaged St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center in the training and hiring of community residents. Health Train, a program operating on Syracuse's North Side geared toward the health care industry, graduated 10 people in its third class in 2013, all of whom have been placed in jobs at St. Joseph's. To date, 38 people have graduated and 37 of those graduates remain employed at the hospital, a 97 percent graduation rate and 97 percent job placement rate. This is a successful replication of the Green Train model, which has graduated 12 classes totaling 170 participants since 2009, with a graduation rate of 92 percent and job placement rate of 76 percent. In 2013, the program had 24 graduates, 92 percent graduation rate and 80 percent job placement rate. Colgate University is Madison County's largest private employer. The institution plays a major direct in economic development, and also contributes indirectly. The Center for Arts and Culture is a Round 4 priority project that will relocate two university museums into a newly constructed facility in downtown Hamilton. Nearly $20 million is expected to be invested, and this property will also stay on the tax rolls (or make payments in lieu of taxes). The Colgate Inn, also in downtown, is one of the county's premier hotel properties and has seen millions of dollars in renovations over the years to create memorable first impressions of Colgate and the inn to reflect the charm, vitality and warmth of the Hamilton community. Additionally, the Hamilton Initiative is a Colgate for-profit LLC, which has directly invested in downtown properties to supercharge downtown's revitalization including specialty stores, coffee shops, restaurant, theaters, and other amenities that make the village a gem in the county. Other independent businesses have sprung up as a result, such as the Zen Den and Good Nature Brewing Company. Revitalize our Region's Urban Cores, Main Streets, and Neighborhoods 20 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL Driving Progress: Near West Side Initiative The Near West Side Initiative (NWSI) continues to make great progress toward holistically revitalizing the Near West Side of Syracuse. In May 2013 the NWSI completed the conversion of a 4,000-square-foot former restaurant into Salt Quarters, an artist-in-residence program. The renovation was made possible by a grant from ArtPlace. Additionally, a $1.2 million REDC grant was utilized to begin renovations to the third floor of the Case Supply Complex, which, once completed, will be home to several market-rate apartments, a creative and performing arts space, and will continue to house the new WCNY and ProLiteracy offices. The NWSI has also continued its mission of community engagement. In 2013 the NWSI partnered with Northside UP , Syracuse University, and Habitat for Humanity to create Salt Works, a social enterprise that hires men and women from the neighborhood to build artisan furniture out of reclaimed timbers from a renovated warehouse on the Near West Side. Salt Works was made possible by a Kresge Foundation grant as well as New York State Opportunity Agenda funds. SUNY Oswego has locations in both the city of Oswego and downtown Syracuse. Oswego is currently developing a new Institute for High Precision Advanced Manufacturing Technologies and Innovation that will concentrate its research and development on blue manufacturing and other sustainable technologies in advanced manufacturing. A partnership with the Port of Oswego Authority is developing a lab for agriculture quality testing for port customers. SUNY Oswego is also developing an Early College Access to In Demand Jobs model in collaboration with local school districts that will address the needs of employers in filling much needed skills as part of the mission of the college's Workforce Investment Board. Finally, SUNY Oswego's Community Incubator Project aligns community businesses, nonprofit organizations, and government institutions to address the core issues of poverty and unemployment and develop opportunities in the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Cayuga Community College intends to jump-start its role as an anchor of economic growth in Auburn through its recent START-UP NY application. Already a major employer in Cayuga County, the community college intends to attract new business to the region and facilitate the growth of emerging businesses as part of this application. Further, Cayuga Community College and SUNY Oswego have invested in bringing workforce development skills to both Auburn and a recently expanded facility in Fulton\u2014an area recognized as having high need for workforce development activities. Morrisville State College has also been a champion in initiating economic development. Through its academic programming, interns and graduates earn applied skills for degrees in automotive technician, nursing, dairy management, hospitality management, and renewable energy. The college also works with Nelson Farms, which provides entrepreneurial agribusiness opportunities for specialty food processors, farmers, growers, and producers. Morrisville is also on the cutting edge of equine rehabilitation and animal husbandry. With a multi million-dollar investment in a state-of-the-art equine rehabilitation facility, the college is adding to its reputation of an outstanding equine sciences degree program at one of the premier facilities in the Northeast. Strategy Implementation in 2014 - 2015 Over the next year, the Municipal Cores Transformational Initiative Team proposes establishing a CNY Revitalization Fund to make funds available to: Prioritize adaptive reuse and historic rehabilitation; Provide support for brownfield revitalization and cleanup efforts; Support industrial reuse planning and development; Maintain residential redevelopment growth in central business districts; Support sustainable transit-oriented development strategies; Encourage mixed-use development in revitalization projects; and Focus on fostering, promoting, and attracting entrepreneurial development, such as innovation districts. Part 1 | OVERVIEW OF PROGRESS 21 v Strategy: Repurpose Existing Infrastructure to Recreate Density in Development and Capitalize on Regional Assets Central New York has a robust network of critical infrastructure in the region's commercial and manufacturing centers; however, necessary repairs and proactive improvements are needed to optimize intelligent development. Infill and adaptive reuse policies are changing the conversation around new development \u2014 both commercial and industrial. In addition, the region's strong arts and culture venues make urban cores destinations for university students, local residents, and visitors. The Municipal Core Transformational Initiative Team recommends allowing underutilized land to be used to its full potential, generating new tax revenue and utilizing a complete streets model. Several key neighborhoods are seeing an entrepreneurial rebirth. These Innovation Districts rehabilitate an urban environment and promote a welcoming environment for innovation-oriented activities, thereby attracting entrepreneurial density in urban cores. In Syracuse, a Tech Corridor is developing along the previously underutilized Warren Street corridor and a creative resurgence is emerging from the intensive neighborhood revitalization effort on the Near West Side.Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation Water Resources - Many of Central New York's municipal centers have access to pristine water resources and Central New York prioritizes its water resources and waterfront revitalization projects. The council has invested more than $11 million in waterfront revitalization projects. Moving forward the council will continue to invest in mixed-use development in waterfront communities, promote the attraction and retention of water-intensive industries, advance the development of low-cost and sustainable energy resources, and support the marketing of recreational and heritage tourism around the region's water assets. S yracuse Inner Harbor - The Syracuse Inner Harbor, recipient of REDC awards (Round 1 and 2), is the first new neighborhood in the city of Syracuse in decades. Development to date includes completion of substantial environmental remediation and infrastructure improvements to enable development of the 28-acre site. Recently, Governor Cuomo attended the groundbreaking of the site's first building, an Aloft Hotel, and announced a second hotel. Additionally, SUNY ESF and SUNY OCC have applied for a $20 million SUNY 2020 Challenge Grant to build the SUNY Water Research and Education Center at the Inner Harbor as part of its redevelopment. This center would establish a permanent presence for SUNY ESF and SUNY OCC's programs focused on the lake and the environment. These programs would reach undergraduates, graduate students, K-12 students and teachers, researchers, and New Yorkers in need of job training. It will blend research, recreation, tourism, environmental interpretation and educational and entrepreneurial opportunities and bring vitality to the Inner Harbor. There is also potential for START-UP NY opportunities on associated with the proposed center. Driving Progress: Addressing Vacant Properties The Greater Syracuse Land Bank is tackling the City of Syracuse's dual issue of thousands of tax-delinquent properties and an abundance of vacant structures. Several programs are taking root. Using funds from the New York State attorney general, the Greater Syracuse Land Bank is renovating 50 single-family/owner-occupied homes. Forty homes are in the city and 10 additional homes are in municipal cores adjacent to the city line. The Land Bank is also implementing a Home-Ownership Choice Program. When listing single-family homes in move-in or nearly move-in ready condition, the Land Bank will wait up to 60 days for a qualified offer from a buyer who plans to occupy the home as a primary residence, before considering other offers on the property. The Greater Syracuse Land Bank is acquiring and stabilizing properties in Syracuse and Onondaga County. Assemblyman William Magnarelli, CenterState CEO's Rob Simpson, Steve Aiello of COR Development, and Governor Cuomo look over plans for the new Aloft hotel at the Syracuse Inner Harbor.

The Plaza is considered critical to downtown Auburn's revitalization and its commercial and emerging cultural corridor. v Strategy: Retrain to Develop the Workforce of Tomorrow A vital component to rejuvenating CNY's urban cores and neighborhoods is providing residents with quality Pre-K-12 education including complementary after- school and summer support and tools to navigate career and education pathways. Entrenched challenges, including high unemployment and poverty rates in older center-city neighborhoods and former small-town manufacturing centers, must be tackled holistically, and it will take years for their effectiveness to be fully realized. Round 1-3 Project & Strategy Implementation Say Yes to Education - The Say Yes Transformational Initiative Team is finding innovative ways to prepare today's students for tomorrow's careers. This year, Say Yes to Education's Collaborative Partner Colleges located in Central New York (Cayuga Community College, SUNY OCC, Morrisville State College, SUNY Oswego, SUNY Cortland, SUNY ESF, St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center, and Syracuse University) brought together more than 65 incoming students during a six-week Summer Success Academy. Partially funded through a $50,000 CFA grant, the 2014 Summer Success Academy\u2014an initiative of the Say Yes to Education Collaborative, the Syracuse City School District, and various other members\u2014was hosted by SUNY OCC.

Part 1 | OVERVIEW OF PROGRESS 23 1.1 OVER VIEW OF JOB CREATION AND INVESTMENT At the four-year point in the REDC process, the council's focus on leveraging private investment, anticipating community needs, and project monitoring ensures that each job created and every dollar invested aligns with its three fundamental goals. As detailed above, the combination of REDC projects and the work of the Transformational Initiative Teams is creating innovative policy solutions and strong partnerships among the council, local employers, and educational institutions \u2014 fostering a new Central New York. Over three rounds, the CNY REDC's ROI for Priority Projects is more than $1 billion leveraged for all council-funded projects. The council prioritizes projects that create employment opportunities for all skill levels, respond to the businesses community's needs, and maximize the return on New York State dollars invested in Central New York.1.2 ST ATUS OF ROUND 1-3 PROJECTS While a handful of projects have faced challenges over the past three years, the vast majority are making progress toward leveraging state investment into business expansion and job growth. After three years of proactively supporting priority projects, the CNY REDC is witnessing completion of a number of Rounds 1, 2, and 3 projects. Round 1 Projects Projects expect to create 805 jobs, while retaining 377 jobs. Indirect job creation through construction and ancillary job creation is expected to be 1,024 jobs. A combined state investment of $102,367,116 leveraged a total investment of $491,081,256. Round 2 ProjectsProjects expect to create 799 jobs, while retaining 826 jobs.

The PPWG has engaged 1,445 residents, surpassing the five-year goal of engaging 1,000 citizens. The PPWG's goal to have a statewide forum to utilize the Central New York region's central location was accomplished April 9, 2014, when the Central New York REDC hosted the Round IV Leadership Work Group session. The PPWG continues to engage through its Facebook page, which has more than 350 likes. The \"Taking the Pulse\" survey, distributed each year at the Great New York State Fair, is one method the council uses to measure CNY REDC message effectiveness. The State Fair offers the CNY REDC a unique opportunity to communicate directly with its constituents and educate a state-wide audience about the Regional Economic Development Councils. Additionally, a new \"It's About You\" effort is underway. Through the new campaign, the PPWG will engage smaller organizations and businesses in the CNY community. These businesses should capitalize on the multiplier effect REDC projects have on the local economy. Small businesses, the CNY REDC, and the local economy all benefit when they can identify the impetus for a project, recognize the impact on their day-to-day work, and realize the economic benefits of keeping these dollars local. As described in more detail on page 46, additional efforts were undertaken this year to enhance the project pipeline, including partnering with local professional service providers to provide detailed briefings on how to submit grants, deploying a new web-based prequalification survey for those intending to apply; and providing enhanced one-one-one assistance to applicants and project sponsors from previous rounds. The CNY REDC maintains a web presence at regionalcouncils.ny.gov/content/central-newyork, where public events and survey details are posted, along with pertinent documents related to the Strategic Plan. As part of its ongoing social media efforts, the CNY REDC Facebook page (facebook.com/CNYREDC) is utilized to help publicize events and outreach activities, highlight progress on projects, and create a space for a dialogue among stakeholders throughout Central New York. With 358 \"fans\" and counting, this campaign has successfully reached more than 10,000 unique Facebook pages through postings this year. See Appendix D for additional details of the Public Participation Work Group's Yearly Update and sample meeting notes. Implementation in 2014 - 2015 While the \"It's About You\" efforts are in their infancy, several ideas have been generated through the PPWG's efforts. Ways to increase public participation among small business owners and increase benefits for the local economy could be assisted through increasing the registration of MWBE's in Central New York, creation of a local vendors list to help local contractors bid on the RFPs of awardees, or an expo event hosted by the REDC to help awardees find local vendors. A small business outreach committee was suggested to take on some of these tasks.

Over the past year, the council made it a priority to develop and monitor metrics that show quantitatively the direct impact of its goals and strategies in Central New York. In addition to adding this new feature in this year's report, the council is taking a more detailed look into the performance of its targeted industry clusters over the past ten years and topline economic indicators. Overall Regional Economic Indicators Although the council is tracking new performance indicators for the regional economic development community, it remains deeply committed to monitoring the region's top level economic indicators. This year, the council is tracking two new indicators directly related to its strategic goals: 1. Total Employment in Foreign-Owned Enterprises - A new indicator provided by the Brookings Institution that examines a key component of Foreign Direct Investment activities. 2. Net Establishment Change - This is used to examine the amount of business churn, or the ratio of business start ups relative to business closings each year. A high total change indicates that more businesses are starting up, with some failing each year. This is a strong measurement of the culture of entrepreneurship in a region. Overall Regional Performance Indicators Starting Point Current 5-Year Goal % Change Progress to Date (% change)National $38.3 B (2012) $40.48 Total Employment in Foreign-owned Businesses10,050 (1991) 10,780 (2011) 5.6 million (2011) $41,884 an estimated figure. \u00c7: The region is ahead or on pace with its five-year goal for this metric. \u00c8: The region is behind its goal for this metric; requires additional attention or evaluation.40 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL Detailed Industry Performance In its original report, the council outlined seven industry clusters that it considered to be critical to leading regional economic growth. Over the past three years, many priority projects have focused on advancing these concentrations and have attracted more than $80 million in New York State funding. While the performance of these industries has been mixed, they still represent a critical component of regional employment. Employment 2002 2008 2012 6 YR % Change 10 YR % Change 1.

As detailed in Part One, the work of the council, Transformational Initiative Teams, and priority projects over the past three years has resulted in tangible impacts that can be seen in the advancement of regional industry concentrations, new market growth, and revitalization in municipal centers. This implementation section highlights the actions and priorities for 2014-2015 that will keep Central New York at the forefront of economic development while it tackles policy areas where more attention is needed to ensure success. 2.0 2 014-2015 REGIONAL PRIORITES A) Implementing Global Marketing and Export Strategies Over the past several years, Central New York has significantly increased investment in global engagement strategies. The region's current suite of programs and services is made possible by leveraging regional resources with several federal grants. To continue this growth, the Central New York and Mohawk Valley regions identified a handful of areas for potential investment from and partnership with New York State. The Central New York International Business Alliance has already shown its ability to directly engage businesses in exporting activities; yet, there are additional programs, strategies, and services that it could launch. Strategies Strategies, elaborated on in further detail in Part Four, to further build a global engagement support ecosystem in Central New York and the Mohawk Valley include: v Strengthen and expand the delivery of export support services throughout the Central New Y ork and Mohawk Valley Regionsv Position Central New Y ork and the Mohawk Valley Regions as global centers for Foreign Direct Investment v Align global efforts with other economic development priorities B) Promoting Veterans' Participation in the Workforce The CNY REDC has chartered a Veterans' Work Group (Appendix C), comprised of regional leaders in business, government, and higher education, to further develop region-wide strategies to ensure that veterans acquire the necessary skills to successfully transition into the Central New York civilian workforce and contribute to the region's economic growth. The Work Group's charge is to bring national resources and partnerships together with Governor Cuomo's initiatives on veterans' employment and entrepreneurship to develop coordinated strategies to effectively serve veterans throughout Central New York and the state. Strategies Strategies, elaborated on in further detail in Part Five, to construct new workforce systems and partnerships to integrate veterans into the workforce include: v Better understand the veteran support ecosystem v Align veteran engagement activities with the workforce alignment system v Catalyze veteran entrepreneurship C) Transforming the Regional Business Climate through Local Government Collaboration At the state level, policy changes and a fresh outlook are combating the perception that the price tag to do business in New York State is simply too high to be cost effective. However, without cooperation from local municipalities, reform efforts will be incomplete. Implementation CNY's Veteran Workforce See Part Five for how Central New York is putting its veterans to work CNY Going Global See Part Four for full details of the Central New York REDC's Global NY plan Part 2 | IMPLEMENTATION 45 In January 2014, a local government modernization commission, known as Consensus, convened to perform a comprehensive study of government structure in Onondaga County. One of the first comprehensive efforts in New York State, Consensus brings together a diverse coalition of business leaders, local government officials, community groups, and the academic community. Through data-driven solutions, Onondaga County's government structures can be modernized to meet the needs of the 21st century, equitably focusing local resources to grow the economy and protect community assets. Lessons learned and best practices from Consensus will be shared and serve as action models for communities across New York State. Transforming the regional business climate also means engaging local government officials to comprehensively address bureaucratic and policy changes that will promote economic development. As noted below, the Central New York Regional Empire State Development office and council leadership are building relationships with key business and political leaders in each of the five counties.D) Supporting NY Rising Community Reconstruction Plan The NY Rising Community Reconstruction Program is designed to empower communities affected by storms, to create and implement locally created strategies for rebuilding and strengthening their communities against future extreme weather events. In Madison County, the strategies are based on the needs of the county and developed by the NY Rising Madison County Planning Committee, community leaders, experts and officials. The CNY REDC's NYE-RIC Transformational Initiative Team has identified an abundance of infrastructure expertise that can contribute to building resilient communities across the state. Severe rainstorms hit 15 Upstate New York counties from June 27 to July 4, 2013, causing massive flooding, erosion, property damage, and long-term power outages. According to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data, areas in Madison County received up to 4.5 inches of rain between June 27-28 and United States Geological Survey gauges reported Oneida Creek at more than 16 feet in Oneida; the Creek's base flow is typically around three feet and the National Weather Service flood stage is 11 feet. In the northern part of Madison County, the city of Oneida was severely impacted by the overtopping of the Oneida Creek on June 28. More than 200 housing units were flooded in the Oneida Flats neighborhood, displacing residents and causing power outages. Additionally, municipal buildings were flooded, including the city DPW garage. In the southern and central part of the county,z small communities such as Nelson, Hamilton, Brookfield, Eaton, Morrisville and DeRuyter were also impacted by flash flooding. Countywide, roads and culverts were damaged by the sheer force of the water and from floating debris. Homes were evacuated, businesses were destroyed and agricultural crops were washed away. After the summer 2013 storms, Madison County officials immediately began working with local officials, state officials, FEMA and the public to assess the damage and identify immediate recovery needs. Governor Cuomo deployed local flood assistance teams to help residents apply for storm-related assistance. Madison County formed an Emergency Management Committee (EMC) to evaluate what recovery needs existed in the county. The EMC has evolved into the NY Rising Madison County Planning Committee to guide the development of a County-wide Resiliency Plan. Strategies Working with a team of consultants, community experts, and the public, the NY Rising Madison County Resiliency Planning Committee is identifying key projects to rebuild affected areas stronger than before. All projects will: reduce the level of risk and meet an identified community need; help or improve the resilience of vulnerable populations; and implement goals and objectives through discrete projects and initiatives. The strategies and projects will fall into six categories: Community Planning and Capacity Building Economic Recovery Sen. Dave Valesky, Rob Simpson, Sen. John DeFrancisco, and Neil Murphy announce a significant state grant for Consensus. Implementation in 2014-2015Utilizing a $250,000 grant provided by State Senators John DeFrancisco and DavidValesky, to date Consensus has held three public meetings and hired the Center for Governmental Research (CGR). Public outreach will continue throughout the year via public meetings, social media, and a robust online presence. In tandem, CGR will perform in-depth analysis focused on: The number and types of local governments in Onondaga County and the costs associated with those governments; The nature and extent of services delivered by various types of local governments; and Opportunities and barriers to restructuring local government functions and services and the extent to which more efficient practices can improve the performance of local government and the delivery of public services. 46 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL Health and Social Services Housing Infrastructure Natural and Cultural Resources Currently, the Planning Committee is evaluating projects for inclusion in its final report. E) Sustaining and Enhancing the Project Pipeline In Central New York, the regional Empire State Development office and council leadership are building relationships with key business and political leaders in each of the five counties and reaching out directly to more than 120 elected officials. The Public Participation Work Group's efforts emphasize the council's unparalleled commitment to an inclusive process, build awareness of the council's work and the consolidated funding application process, and underscore the vital role local leaders play in the region's success each year.F) Addressing Regional Workforce Development Needs for Key Sectors As noted throughout this progress report, Central New York's workforce development needs and services span a broad swath of existing council priorities and regional efforts. One of the most exciting pilot programs is Work Train, which, as noted below, is part of the CNY Opportunity Agenda and a prime example of the inventive solutions that Central New York is developing. As noted by the Job Linkage and Opportunity Agenda Work Groups, the region must continue to address the challenge of properly aligning efforts to meet the needs of both individuals and businesses. Then, if and where gaps exist, resources will be poised to take swift action. G) Refining the Reg ional Opportunity Agenda The CNY Opportunity Agenda is advancing Goal 3's strategy to train the workforce of tomorrow by providing traditionally impoverished populations the opportunity to share in the region's increasing prosperity, linking low-income residents to career opportunities, aligning the needs of employers with the talents of individuals, helping newly employed residents improve their financial capacity, and cultivating entrepreneurship within distressed communities. The CNY Opportunity Agenda reflects core strategies the council identified over the past four years. The Opportunity Agenda Task Force is making significant progress on two critical components: Linking low-income residents to quality jobs through a dual client model; and Helping residents develop businesses in their communities through targeted business development and incubation programs. Syracuse leadership established Work Train, a workforce initiative, driven by a collaborative of leaders representing business, economic development, philanthropy, workforce development, local government, training and education, and grassroots organizations. With the support of the National Fund for Workforce Solutions, Work Train will establish a dual client Implementation in 2014-2015 This year, the council and ESD regional staff initiated three new activities to sustain the flow of quality project applications moving forward: Partner with local professional services providers - In May, the council held its first roundtable with local professional service providers, including law firms, accountants, and real estate professionals, to provide a detailed briefing on the process for submitting grants. More than 75 professionals joined this conversation to learn how the council could invest in their clients' projects. Participants also discussed ways in which the council could enhance its efforts to promote the CFAs and the types of projects that make a competitive application for future rounds. Launch a new \"intending to apply\" surve y - This year, the council created a new survey on its website to help identify companies that were considering an application. Companies who participated in this survey received enhanced support from council members in developing their projects and putting together applications that aligned with the council's goals. In the coming years, this tool will enable the council to work with projects that have great potential in order to maximize their opportunities for success. Provide enhanced one-on-one assistance to applicants - Beginning this year, leaders from the council, in partnership with local economic development officials, are working directly with projects funded in previous council rounds. Checking on the status of projects and providing one-on-one assistance are intended to help project leaders work through obstacles and challenges in moving forward with their projects. This effort is pushing a number of previously stalled projects back onto a path toward completion.Implementation in 2014-2045 Over the next year the Job Linkage Work Group will: Document the different structures and relationships between regional one-stops and area colleges and consider the opportunities and challenges presented by each model. Communicate with businesses in the priority business sectors to identify employer training needs and experiences navigating the existing workforce and training infrastructures in their areas. Propose a workforce development model that connects county-based one-stops and area colleges and delivers effective job linkage suited for Central New York's workforce needs. Part 2 | IMPLEMENTATION 47 workforce development platform in the region \u2014 serving the needs of employers and job seekers alike. The platform is designed to adapt within different industries and across different skill levels. The work of the past year was made possible by NYS Opportunity Agenda funding, which enabled Work Train to obtain a $1 million commitment over three years from philanthropic organizations in Syracuse. Work Train has launched an inaugural partnership with Loretto to train up to 100 workers this year to meet the company's immediate need for workers in the health care field. Two business development programs launched in the past year directly link to the Opportunity Agenda. UP Start Syracuse is a comprehensive platform for business development and incubation. Seven businesses are participating in a pilot entrepreneur cohort. UP Start's businesses represent distressed communities and the program provides comprehensive incubation services and seed funding. The second, Salt Works, is a social enterprise employing Work Train graduates. Salt Works aggregates services, resources and expertise among The Tech Garden, Northside UP , SUNY EOC, the Near West Side Initiative, ProLiteracy, Cooperative Federal Credit Union, and the Small Business Development Center.2.1 O THER NEW CNY REDC PRIORITIES Innovation Districts In alignment with the promotion of START-UP NY zones, the CNY REDC is committed to promoting the work of economic development activities across their traditional boundaries. This supports the council's efforts to strengthen cross industry collaboration by encouraging common innovations among medical devices, radar systems, and clean energy in the Data to Decisions cluster. This is also occurring with workforce alignment as training programs are aligning with high job demand sectors. Finally, the council has long been committed to focusing economic development activities directly into geographic areas of high opportunity and need. This year, the council will accelerate this effort by pursuing a new focus on developing Innovation Districts throughout Central New York. According to the Brookings Institution, Innovation Districts are geographic areas where anchor institutions and companies work together and connect with entrepreneurship support entities. These districts are compact, accessible, and offer housing, office and retail opportunities. Across the country, districts in cities such as Chattanooga, and Boston developed these districts to encourage new innovations by encouraging talented and diverse people to live and/or work in close proximity. The combination of Innovation Districts and the real estate benefits provided by START-UP NY present new opportunities for entrepreneurial activities to thrive. Specifically, in Central New York, two innovation district zones have been developing over the past several years. These zones show strong opportunity for growth in the near term, and as others emerge, the council will prioritize support to encourage their proliferation: Near West Side Initiative - The Near West Side leverages the resources of Syracuse University, the state, the city, private foundations, businesses, nonprofit corporations, and neighborhood residents to achieve its goals. These partners collectively support housing, commercial, arts, community building, and business development opportunity. The Near West Side's position as an innovation district is rooted in its ability to connect the resources of anchor groups, such as Syracuse University, with a traditionally distressed neighborhood directly adjacent to downtown Syracuse. This partnership has resulted in a number of successes in the past eight years, including the leveraging of $70 million in new capital investment that brought 337 full-time jobs to the neighborhood. In addition 60 homes have been built or rehabilitated and 45 Syracuse University faculty members and over 1,000 students have been engaged in the effort. Further, $3.3 million in green infrastructure has been invested in the neighborhood including residential street reconstruction and green roofs. The Near West Side is poised for further growth as a key component of Syracuse University's START-UP NY plan. Implementation in 2014-2015 To build upon the Opportunity Agenda's first year success, the Opportunity Agenda Task Force will: Develop strategies for engaging extremely low-income individuals, facing significant barriers to success, within Work Train and other mainstream workforce platforms. Develop a method and resources for financing and accelerating growth for businesses and entrepreneurs from underrepresented populations and distressed communities. Develop strategies for building leadership capacity within distressed communities. Begin scaling CNY Opportunity Agenda strategies beyond Syracuse, across the five CNY counties.UP Start Syracuse classroom.48 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL Tech Corridor - A section of downtown Syracuse has been quietly growing as an urban magnet for tech-oriented businesses. Warren Street, which is home to The Tech Garden and Syracuse CoWorks, has seen a number of smaller entrepreneurship-based developments in the past year. The corridor represents an opportunity to align urban revitalization with other economic development activities through the designation of The Tech Garden as an Innovation Hot Spot and the development of START-UP NY zones in the area. StartFast Venture Accelerator has occupied a ground floor space along the corridor and new firms, such as Open Atelier Architects, have moved in to the area. Over the next couple of years, a number of additional revitalization projects could continue to offer commercial and office space in vacant buildings that are directly connected into the entrepreneurship support services available in the corridor. Further, established tech-oriented firms such as the Syracuse Media Group, Sutherland Global Services, and WIPRO have located in the district. 2.2 ONGOING STATE PRIORITES A) NY SUNY 2020 Challenge Grants Announced as part of the second round of SUNY 2020 Challenge Grants, the SUNY Institute of Environmental Health and Environmental Medicine creates a collaboration among SUNY ESF, SUNY Upstate Medical University, SUNY Oswego, and SUNY OCC. The Institute of Environmental Health & Environmental Medicine is the first of its kind in the nation, intersecting medicine, environment, engineering, entrepreneurship, technology and education. The Institute will expand new research, provide academic and industry collaborations, and offer associate through doctorate degrees with a focus on improving health through understanding the environment's impact on health and medicine. The Institute will leverage the strengths of four SUNY campuses and other regional partners to support teaching, research, health care and entrepreneurial activity. The Institute will also collaborate with area industry partners including Welch Allyn, Colden Corporation, C&S Companies, O'Brien & Gere, and ConMed Corporation. The project expects to create 400 construction jobs, 651 permanent jobs in the wireless technology field and other areas of development, and expand student enrollments. It also expects to contribute to 20 patents and at least 22 new startup companies in five years. As mentioned previously, SUNY ESF and SUNY OCC are applying for a Round 3 SUNY 2020 Challenge Grant to build the SUNY Water Research and Education Center in Syracuse's new Inner Harbor neighborhood, which will provide an educational anchor to this economic development initiative. The CNY REDC has designated a SUNY 2020 Work Group (Appendix C) of business and academic leaders to assist the SUNY campuses with their planning efforts, and to ensure that we are fully utilizing SUNY as one of our most important economic development assets in the region. The Work Group will provide an overview of the CNY REDC vision to help guide the colleges as they move forward with the Challenge Grant process in future rounds of grants, and will help oversee the execution of the current projects in the program. B) Cleaner , Greener Communities Sustainability Plan: VisionCNY Since adoption of VisionCNY in June 2013, the Central New York Regional Planning and Development Board (CNY RPDB) has been actively engaged in identifying, developing, and assisting communities in their efforts to secure funding through NYSERDA's Phase II CGC program. In the program's first year, five projects were awarded grants totaling $3,145,000 through this initial funding round, including a grant of $1,343,000 to support the development of a geo-thermal system to support COR Development's Syracuse Inner Harbor project and funding for the City of Syracuse to comprehensively update its zoning ordinance for the first time in more than three decades. The CNY RPDB is engaged in a number of other initiatives to help implement VisionCNY, including assisting municipalities to adopt zoning ordinances and the state's model solar PV permit. Also noteworthy is an effort to establish a regional collaborative solar PV procurement program in Central New York. These efforts leverage support from the U.S. Department of Energy Rooftop Solar Challenge Program and NYSERDA's Solar PV Balance of System Cost Reduction Program. C) I nnovation Hot Spot Central New York's Innovation Hot Spot, awarded in 2013, is actively engaging prospects and integrating the Hot Spot benefits into the regions existing incubation, commercialization, and acceleration offerings. As noted in Part One, the CNY Hot Spot, guided by a 21-member council representing regional partners, is aligning the efforts and resources already in existence to maximize the Hot Spot's benefits across the Central New York region. The increased coordination the Hot Spot Council affords will enable incubators to benefit from each other's experiences, share best practices, and provide unparalleled support to new ventures. Additionally, as outlined in the 2013 CNY Hot Spot Plan, The Tech Garden added 18,300 square feet to its footprint in downtown Syracuse. The CNY Hot Spot is committed to attracting new tenants, both at physical locations and virtually, in neighborhoods and Innovation Districts. The CNY Hot Spot will also work to foster connections between its programs and services and complementary connections with START-UP NY zones across the region. Part 2 | IMPLEMENTATION 49 D) Interregional Collaboration In 2013, the council reported on cross- regional collaborative projects that were either conceptual or in early stages of their development. In November 2013, the CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity committed the 12-county CenterState region, which span five councils, to pursuing a new growth strategy based on market-driven opportunities and a shared approach to economic development planning and execution. The Agenda outlined four areas that represent an outsize opportunity to shift the region's economic trajectory in the coming years: build capacities in data to decisions innovation, create a regional seed and venture fund, establish a government modernization commission, and enhance the region's global engagement. Since the Agenda's release, several significant milestones have been achieved: Launch of Armory Square Ventures With an initial capital call of $15 million and a goal to raise up to $40 million, the new seed and venture fund closes a significant gap in capital infrastructure to support entrepreneurs and early stage firms. Operating across all regions in New York, the fund is working with entrepreneurial networks throughout the state, targeting companies seeking private financing in the $500,000 to $2 million range for expansion or growth. Armory Square Ventures is focusing on firms in the CenterState region although it is not restricted to regional firms or target industries. Growth of the CNY International Business Alliance Launched in 2011 as a result of the CenterState Metropolitan Export Initiative, the CNYIBA has expanded its staff capacity and export assistance services. Over the past three years, the CNYIBA has provided direct assistance to more than 140 companies in and around the 12-county CenterState region. The CNYIBA is leveraging two federal grants that provide direct funding and assistance to companies looking to visit and enter new foreign markets. Creation of Consensus Launched in early 2014, Consensus, the commission on local government modernization, will explore approaches for improving local government in Onondaga County and propose a practical path forward, based on public input and rigorous analysis of the costs and benefits of existing government structures. As part of its work, the commission will evaluate government modernization efforts around the country to develop recommendations for improving the delivery of services and increasing cost effectiveness. The work will provide lessons learned and best practices that can create a model for government modernization that can be applied to other areas of the region and beyond. Achieving UAS Test Site Designation for the Northeast UAS Airspace Integration Research Alliance (NUAIR) In late 2013, a public/private partnership led by representatives from the Mohawk Valley and Central New York regions won a competitive designation from the Federal Aviation Administration to become a designated Unmanned Aerial Systems test site. The test site will be operated by the partnership, known as the NUAIR Alliance, and should begin test flights in summer 2014. The council has submitted an application in the 2014 round of funding to develop a fully instrumented UAS test site across the Central New York and Mohawk Valley regions. 50 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL Central New York Mohawk ValleyNorth Country Southern Tier Western NY Hudson Valley New York CityLong Island Capital RegionFinger Lakes GOAL 1: Strengthen Targeted Industry Concentrations that Leverage Unique Economic Assets Clean Energy and Environmental Systems/AM-TEC x x x x x x x x x x Data 2 Decisions -

The Greater Syracuse Land Bank is developing a strategy to act as the conduit owner of historic properties for the community to take time to develop thoughtful and sustainable plans for the resources' preservation. In many instances, the Land Bank may attempt to assemble larger parcels of land before marketing them for sale, to facilitate a more valuable development or a development project more consistent with the Land Bank's disposition policies or the comprehensive plan of the community in which the properties are located. The Land Bank may perform environmental assessments as part of larger marketing efforts. Many former facilitites have been redeveloped for new industrial uses: Magna has demolished 500,000 sq. ft. of its obsolete structure, leaving a cement pad for future development; 96,000 sq. ft. of the facility has been leased to Ultra Dairy for storage. The former Syracuse China building, renamed Lyndale Commercial Park, has had 450,000 sq. ft. demolished, leaving a pad for development and 200,000 sq. ft. of the former facility available.

In addition, the council factored in a project's alignment with the region's Transformational Initiatives, geographic breakdown throughout the region, and impact on underrepresented groups and neighborhoods. Finally, with a three year record to consult, the council considered project sponsor's past performance. As in the past, additional variables guiding the selection process included five-year payroll projections, number of jobs created and retained, return on CNY REDC investment, and total project investment leveraged. The ROI variable is the sum of total project costs and five-year payroll divided by the state assistance to produce a number capturing the return the state receives on the initial investment. See Appendix E for the New York State Consolidated Funding Application Endorsement Standards used as additional guidelines in the scoring and selection process. Priority Project Desciptions The priority projects listed below, also summarized in Part 3.1, will boost regional payroll, provide solid returns on investment for the region, create and retain jobs, and leverage total project costs of nearly $230 Million to advance the goals and strategies of the CNY REDC Five-Year Strategic Plan and this progress update. v Strategy: Invest in Existing Regional Industry Concentrations and Businesses AM-TEC SBB, Inc - Expansion (Onondaga) SBB will purchase an existing TECS manufacturer and construct a new building for the combined businesses.

The collective impact of these recommended projects will support every community in the Central New York region. The council works hard to identify projects that will grow the region's cities and towns, while also rewarding the collaborative ventures among businesses, industries, and anchor institutions. The $26,617,832 being requested ( $25,677,683 in ESD grant funding and $940,149 in Excelsior credits) for these 36 priority projects will be leveraged to: Generate $229,700,302 in total project costs Retain 90 jobs Result in the direct creation of 894 new jobs, 9,996 construction jobs, and 58 indirect jobs Produce a five-year payroll of $98,921,973 Produce a return on investment of 12.3 Additionally, many of the proposed priority projects will coordinate with the strategies outlined in both the Global NY (Part 4) and Veterans (Part 5) plans, further enhancing their qualitative benefits to the region. Additional Strategic Projects (CFA-related State Agency Applications) The CNY REDC received and reviewed additional CFAs for state agency funding. These additional projects are key contributors to the region's transformation, and the council's review and recommendation of these Round 4 projects continue efforts to align the missions of state agencies with the goals and strategies of the council. The council applied the region's goals and considered the opportunities defined by its strategic priorities to select 64 projects for CFA-Related State Agency funding. All of the 64 projects meet at least one of the region's strategic goals, 33 (52 percent) meet two or more goals, and 4 (6 percent) advance all three of the CNY REDC's goals. These projects applied for $16,193,131 in CFA-related state agency funding (12 percent of total project costs) , which would leverage $134,651,315 in total project costs. Coupled with the priority projects, Transformational Initiatives, and other state priorities, these projects position the region to strengthen targeted industries, improve its competitiveness in the national and global economies, engage with veterans and revitalize its urban and rural communities.70 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL Cayuga County Stonewell Bodies Machine,

In the late part of the 20th century, several disruptive economic forces struck Central New York and Mohawk Valley, along with adjacent regions of the North Country and Southern Tier. The globalization of the economy brought about foreign competition. Mergers and acquisitions of local firms, many by foreign-owned businesses, removed local corporate decision making for many large Upstate firms. In light of these challenges, economic development, private, and public community leaders have rallied around efforts to change the combined regions' role in the global market. These efforts were driven by the simple fact that the global middle class continues to expand in places like China, Brazil and Southeast Asia at rates faster than its expansion domestically. Regional leaders have realized that if they want to maintain and strengthen existing jobs while laying the framework for future job growth, they must reposition the region for stronger global engagement.To achieve this, in 2011 community leaders embarked on a new program with the Brookings Institution known as the Metropolitan Export Initiative. This year-long program included a comprehensive market assessment (including business interviews and surveys) to determine the health of the local export economy. The program concluded with the launch of the CenterState Export Plan, designed to enhance and grow exports for businesses within the 12-county CenterState region. Since the launch of the plan, Brookings has rebranded the program through a partnership with JPMorgan Chase as the Global Cities Initiative. This new program has helped 12 communities develop export plans throughout the United States with an additional eight expected to complete plans by the end of 2014. By the end of 2014, metropolitan areas that have developed export plans will cover 20 percent of the total U.S. population, 19 percent of total U.S. jobs, and 20 percent of total U.S. production. Though the community has been publicly recognized for its work in supporting export growth, becoming a more globally engaged region also includes a strategic focus on advancing foreign direct investment activities and creating a culture of openness that allows immigrants to find meaningful employment. While much has been reported on the benefits of growing exports ($1 billion in export growth for a metro area generally accounts for the creation of 5,600 new jobs) , attracting foreign direct investment provides a much more nuanced, yet equally important, economic benefit to regions. Foreign-owned companies employ roughly two percent of workers in the United States. While these employment numbers may seem relatively low, foreign-owned companies are often some of the most competitive and stable companies in a region. For example, foreign-owned firms export their products 3.7 times more than domestic firms. Further, foreign-owned firms invest more in capital and R&D and have 2.3 times higher net income than domestic firms. Enhancing the region's global position through increased exports and attracting new foreign direct investment is a critical driver of current and future job growth. The combined regions can only achieve success in these areas by continuing the practice of developing strategies and goals based on the needs Global NY Current Global Middle Class2030 Projected Global Middle Class North America - 18% North America - 7% Asia Pacific - 28% Europe - 14% Europe - Asia Pacific - Source: Kharas and Gertz, \"The New Global Middle Class,\" 2010 Part 4 | GLOBAL NY 77 of existing businesses. Partnership with the Global NY program can help launch new services and improve existing services to provide more value to businesses throughout the regions that are seeking to grow their exports. Other regions, such as the North Country, are also interested in deploying these services as well. 4.1 M ARKET ASSESSMENT In 2011, community partners initiated a comprehensive, year-long assessment of the local export ecosystem. This analysis included surveys, in-depth interviews, and an analysis of all available data. That original market assessment drove the development of the strategies and tactics that laid the foundation for the region's export development work. Those original key findings have been updated with the most recently available data; yet, many of them still ring true. Ultimately, the common theme identified in 2011 that the region is, on average, less sophisticated about exporting compared to firms in other mid- to large-sized U.S. metropolitan areas is still applicable; however, the past three years of effort are beginning to show that the export initiative is having success. Key Findings: In 2012, the combined Central New York and Mohawk Valley regions exported $7.4 billion worth of goods and services. The figure places the regions at around 50 in terms of total export performance among the top 100 U.S. metro areas. The combined growth for the regions' export economy lagged behind the national average. The regions' growth rate between 2003 and 2012 was 93.7 percent, compared to the national average of 113.31 percent. In 2012 the export of goods represented 65 percent of the regions' total exports, and services comprised the remaining 35 percent. This is an increase in the total intensity of service exporting since 2003, when services represented 30 percent of total regional exports. The combined regions boast a diverse set of export industries that drive the regions' global engagement. The combined regions' export growth has been spread across a number of industries that are closely related to the regions' competitive growth clusters. These include machinery manufacturing; computer and electronic product manufacturing; telecommunications; tourism; transportation equipment; financial services; agriculture; medical equipment; and education and health services. Service exports represent a significant growth opportunity for the region and nation. Nationally, the export of services has continued to steadily rise over the past 10 years. In the combined regions, services exports more than doubled between 2003 and 2012, accounting for an outsized share of the regions' total export growth. The strong growth effects of services export are tied to the region's strong service providers found in the education, health care, engineering and tourism fields. Additionally, the regions' proximity to Canada enhances this opportunity, offering relatively easy entry to a broader market for this emerging component of exports. The original market assessment of the CenterState Metropolitan Export Initiative identified the region as being relatively unsophisticated in global orientation. Subsequent work with local businesses over the past three years has confirmed that many local firms lack basic market knowledge and business acumen regarding the opportunities in selling a good or service overseas. Importantly, 40 percent of respondents to a survey conducted in 2011 indicated that they did not export because they are more focused on domestic markets or they think their good or service could not be sold in foreign markets. This is partially attributed to a lack of knowledge of the best growth opportunity markets for their product or service and a relative unease with cultural and language barriers within target export markets. There is an export awareness gap, and local businesses face a number of real and perceived obstacles that affect their exporting decisions: Lack of qualified export sales and services staff expertise Knowledge of foreign markets Transportation costs U.S. Export Control Laws, regulatory compliance, licensing, inspections, tariffs Global sale contracts, contract negotiations Protection of intellectual property rights Foreign import control laws, regulatory compliance inspections, tariffs Foreign government regulations and policies Global advertising, marketing, distribution Language and cultural barriers Customs clearance Exchange rate fluctuations Export financing The original market assessment identified strong fragmentation among the regions' export service providers. Extensive local export expertise is available through the regions' system of export service providers. However, only 19 of 144 respondents surveyed reported having received local export services during the last 10 years. Though many businesses that have used existing export assistance services ranked them highly, there was not a designated lead for export service provision in the region. Furthermore, there was not a clear delineation of roles and responsibilities among local public / private export service providers, state service providers, and federal assistance experts, making the region's export resources difficult to tap. In 2011, total employment in the Syracuse Metropolitan Statistical Area in foreign-owned firms was 10,780. This was a slight increase from 1991, when total employment was 10,050; however, the Syracuse region did not keep pace in employment growth with the top 100 metro areas and has seen its ranking fall from 61st to 77th for total employment driven 78 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL by foreign-owned firms. Further, foreign-owned employment represents 4.2 percent of overall employment in the Syracuse metro area, an increase from 3.9 percent in 1991. Yet, as with the total employment numbers, the Syracuse metro area again fell in ranking from 1991 to 2011 with its total percentage of overall employment driven by foreign-owned firms (46th in 1991, 67th in 2011). The leading foreign-owned industries in the Syracuse metro in 2011 were power generation, insurance, electrical equipment, aluminum products, and beverage products. The top five source countries for investment into the Syracuse region were England, France, India, Ireland, and Belgium. 4.2 PROGRESS TO DATE IN IMPLEMENTING THE METROPOLITAN EXPORT INITIATIVE With the launch of the CenterState NY Export Plan in 2011 and the subsequent prioritization of driving global competitiveness in the original Central New York and Mohawk Valley Regional Economic Development Council plans released in 2012, the combined Central New York and Mohawk Valley community, as well as the North Country REDC, has embraced the need to go global as a key cornerstone of its future economic growth. Before 2011, the export assistance ecosystem was fragmented in the community with many businesses confused about where to find assistance with their international sales challenges. What's more, many of these companies did not consider the global marketplace as an opportunity for them to grow sales. Therefore, public and private leaders collectively prioritized export growth and agreed to work together toward making this a reality. In the three years since the launch of the Metro Export Initiative, the following progress has been made: Reconstituted the board of the Central New York International Business Alliance (CNYIBA) with dedicated private sector leadership - The CNYIBA, which was previously an all-volunteer group, established a new board of directors that included a majority of private-sector exporters. Established the CNYIBA as the lead group for export assistance in the community - A key finding of the market assessment was that the business community did not know where to go to find export assistance. With the reconstitution of the CNYIBA, the community designated it as the lead group to promote exports and coordinate businesses looking for specific export assistance across the 12-county CenterState region. This footprint covers counties within the Central New York, Mohawk Valley, North Country, Southern Tier, and Finger Lakes regional economic development councils. Hired first professional dedicated export staff in the region - Through a partnership with Syracuse University and other community members, the CNYIBA hired its first professional staff person. Charged with providing direct one- on-one counseling to businesses in the region and launching new export services and program, this staff position is the first dedicated export assistance personnel that the CNY and Mohawk Valley economic development community has had. Launched new educational programs and services - With assistance from partner groups, such as the U.S. Department of Commerce, CNY Technology Development Organization, Syracuse Center of Excellence at Syracuse University, Mohawk Valley Edge, and Syracuse University, the CNYIBA has launched new educational programs and direct export assistance services. These programs are designed to respond to the direct needs of businesses outlined in the market assessment and have steadily gained attendees throughout the past year and a half. Further, the community relaunched an export accelerator program called Export NY in early 2014. This nationally recognized program provides intensive export assistance for companies looking to develop a new-to-export or new-to-market export growth strategy. Launched new export assistance website - Directly addressing the confusion that once existed from businesses looking to find export assistance, the CNYIBA launched a one-stop coordinating website in 2013 (www.cnyiba.net). This site provides simple direction for companies looking to access specific types of export assistance. Received federal funding to enhance trade with Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines - In 2013, the CNYIBA, in partnership with CenterState CEO, was awarded a competitive grant from the U.S. Department of Commerce to enhance the region's exporting to Singapore and other ASEAN nations, chosen for their strong potential market growth for products and services developed in the region. The CNYIBA will launch trade missions and relationship development trips to these countries in late 2014 and 2015. Became an Export-Import Bank City State partner - To ease the availability of export financing to local businesses, the CNYIBA, in partnership with CenterState CEO, was named an Export-Import Bank City State partner in 2012. This partnership provides enhanced consideration and financing assistance for businesses in the region looking to fund or insure export activities. Further, CenterState CEO has become a licensed export loan originating organization and can now provide quicker financial assistance to business looking to access the Export-Import Bank's services. Accelerate Foreign Greenfield Investments and Mergers and Acquisitions - Though foreign direct investment data indicates that total employment driven by foreign-owned firms has plateaued, the region has seen a number of foreign investment projects in the past five years. Some of these projects are more recent than the most updated data, including: 1. K&N - A Pakistani firm has invested more than $4 million in opening a chicken processing operation in the former Birdseye facility in Fulton, Oswego County , which will create 183 jobs. 2. Teti Bakery - A growing Toronto-based business will conduct a $3 million expansion into Oswego County to continue to support its growing U.S. operations , creating 63 jobs. Part 4 | GLOBAL NY 79 3. InBev - One of the largest foreign acquisitions of the past decade occurred when InBev bought Anheuser- Busch. InBev has a large employment presence in Baldwinsville, Onondaga County. More than $300 million has been invested in this production facility in the past decade. 4. Novelis - The world's leading producer of rolled aluminum products is expanding its operations in Oswego County with a $200 million investment. 5. Werma Singatechnik - A German optical and audible signal device firm has opened a sales office in East Syracuse , Onondaga County. 6. Bitzer Scroll - This German firm with an office in DeWitt, Onondaga County, rehabilitated a former GE facility and recently expanded to allow for enhanced production and operations. 7. Felix Schoeller - A German paper converting company located in Pulaski, Oswego County, is making a $6 million investment that will add roughly 155 new jobs at its facility. 8. SAM North America - A South Korean plastic extrusion equipment R&D servicing company has invested $2.2 million in Schroeppel, Oswego County. 9. Huhtamaki - The Finnish food packaging company project in Fulton, Oswego County, is bringing more than $6 million in new investments and an estimated 25 new jobs. 10. Marquardt Switches - The German parent company added 7,000 square feet to its Cazenovia, Madison County, facility in 2013. 11. INFICON - The Swiss-owned firm will add a CNY REDC-supported 64,000 square feet to its manufacturing facility in East Syracuse, Onondaga County, in 2014. 12. Agrana - A leading Austrian food processor of fruit preparations for the dairy industry built a new manufacturing and distribution center in Onondaga County. 13. Brewery Ommegang - A Belgian-owned firm in Otsego County continues to expand and add product lines. It completed a major expansion, and with a workforce that has grown by 80 percent since 2010, Ommegang is one of New York's most popular craft beers. 14. Fage, USA - The second-largest producer of Greek yogurt on the East Coast, this Greek company established its North American production facility in Johnstown, Fulton County, and is in the midst of a 180,000-square-foot expansion that will double production capacity and add more than 100 new dairy manufacturing jobs. 15. Sovena - This German-owned company, the largest bottler/exporter of olive oil in the country, established its North American headquarters in Rome, Oneida County, recently expanded its footprint on Griffiss Technology Park, and employs more than 155 workers.Though it is too early to track the full impact of the CenterState Metro Export Initiative, a number of early indicators shows, the success of the effort. Since the community collectively prioritized export growth as critical to economic growth, larger economic development plans, initiatives, and grant applications often include efforts to enhance international sales. Companies such as SRC Inc. have started exporting for the first time in part as a result of services the CNYIBA provided. CNYIBA representatives have met with more than 150 businesses throughout the 12-county CenterState region (including many in the Mohawk Valley and North Country) to discuss exporting and offer assistance. The efforts of the initiative have also affected regional export assistance partners. The U.S. Department of Commerce reports an increase of the total companies it interacts with in the region by 100 over last year and notes that export initiative is a primary driver of this enhancement. Also, the CNY TDO, in partnership with Syracuse University, relaunched ExportNY with support from the CNYIBA and partner funders. Finally, export companies in the region are experiencing nationwide attention for their participation in these local efforts. INFICON, a recipient of Round 3 REDC funding, received the President's \"E\" Award for exporting excellence in 2013 and was recognized in a ceremony moderated by the secretary of the commerce. INFICON, and a handful of other local companies, have been noted in a number of articles and publications by national news media that report on the success of the program. The community has also attracted visits from prominent export officials and has hosted Export-Import Bank Chairman Fred Hochberg, U.S. Department of Commerce Deputy Secretary nominee Bruce Andrews, and Amy Liu, deputy director of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program. 4.3 PROGRESS IMPLEMENTING GLOBAL NY As mentioned, the larger CenterState region has been working across traditional regional barriers to drive coordinated export assistance. This Global NY plan can help accelerate that collaboration so that even more businesses can become more intentional about their global activities. In addition to strengthening the export assistance pipeline, the collective regions have taken the following steps to launching a successful Global NY plan: Increased coordination among regional councils and business groups between the Mohawk Valley and Central New York regions - Both the Mohawk Valley and Central New York regional economic development councils, through the submission of this joint plan, have committed to adopting the same Global NY plan and strategies in their regions. This coordinated effort will maximize scarce resources, prevent the duplication of efforts, and build a critical mass of participants in export development programming. Planned new events to spread the word about exporting - As a first step to expanding export services to the Mohawk Valley region, the CNYIBA will host a joint event with regional chambers from Mohawk Valley to promote international opportunities and the available export assistance services.80 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL Added new partners to the export assistance pipeline - The CNYIBA is adding new partners to enhance its ability to engage directly with businesses. In addition to expanding all of its services to the entire Mohawk Valley, the CNYIBA will partner with business associations from the North Country and will act as a resource to any of those firms seeking international growth assistance. 4.4 REC OMMENDED GLOBAL NY STRATEGIES Governor Cuomo's plan to enhance how regions address their global engagement comes at an opportune time for Central New York and the Mohawk Valley. The Central New York International Business Alliance is almost three years into its operations and is steadily launching new programs and engaging new companies. The region's foreign direct investment activities will soon get a boost through CenterState CEO's participation in a new planning partnership with the Brookings Institution to enhance foreign direct investment strategies, in similar fashion to the partnership that led to the CenterState Metro Export Initiative. Central New York and the Mohawk Valley have also made significant strides in organizing and growing industry concentrations upon which future global strategies can be built, including: The progress made in the Mohawk Valley region around nanotechnology and chip fabrication; The designation in early 2014 of the Central New York and Mohawk Valley regions as a test site for UAS by the FAA; The recent identification of Data to Decisions as a key industry cluster in the CenterState region; The growing global demand for high-quality agricultural goods; and Activities led by the SyracuseCoE at Syracuse University to support the global growth of thermal and environmental control system firms. With a fully developed global support ecosystem, these industries could better tap into the growing global demand for these products. Additionally, the CNYIBA has shown its ability to engage businesses directly in exporting activities; yet, there are additional programs and services that could be launched to further strengthen the region's global competitiveness, therefore the following strategies are recommended. v Strategy: Strengthen and Expand the Delivery of Export Support Services Throughout the Central New York and Mohawk Valley Regions 1. Exporting Forums \u2014 Discussion groups and forums among current and new-to-export executives designed to share experiences and provide feedback for individuals looking to expand their exports. 2. Export NY - Continue to expand and promote this 16-week export accelerator program so that it may offer two rounds of the program each year.3. Enhance Export Outreach Activities - Engage new partners and individuals in providing one-on-one export services directly to businesses. 4. Expand the CNYIBA's Territory Covered by the IBA's Programs and Services - The IBA covers only two of the most populous (Oneida and Herkimer) of the six counties that are in the Mohawk Valley REDC region. Additionally, the IBA could offer targeted services and assistance to businesses in the North Country. 5. Increase Participation in Overseas Trade Missions and Relationship Development Activities - Engage businesses directly in activities designed to take them overseas to establish relationships and meet directly with potential customers. 6. Coordinate International Tourism Promotion - Tourism is a key export industry in the joint CNY and Mohawk Valley regions. To date, there have been limited collaborative promotional efforts, largely centered on the Erie Canal. An expanded coordinated tourism promotion initiative would deliver key regional assets of history, culture, Destiny USA, Turning Stone Resort and Casino, universities, sports and food/beverages to key travel trade buyers in Canada, Europe, Brazil, and China . v Strategy: Position Central New York and the Mohawk Valley Regions as Global Centers for Foreign Direct Investment 1. Capitalize on START-UP NY zones - START-UP NY is a game-changing economic development program that is tailor-made for foreign ms, Data to Decisions, and thermal and environmental control systems. 2. Develop Trade and Investment Partnerships with Key Overseas Entities - Relationships are often what drive foreign direct investment deals. Economic development partners in the region must focus on developing meaningful economic relationships with overseas entities like trade groups and sovereign wealth funds. 3. Make it Easier for Smaller Foreign Investors to Support Local Businesses - Programs like the EB-5 immigration investment initiative can help aggregate mid-sized investments into having a larger impact. Economic development partners should develop an investment aggregator (possibly in the form of a venture fund) to pool smaller investment into real estate and business development projects. 4. Establish a reshoring program - Reshoring companies and products back to U.S. soil has emerged as a strong trend toward driving U.S. manufacturing growth. Economic development officials in the region will create a reshoring task force framed on attracting investment into supply chains already existing in the region. Part 4 | GLOBAL NY 81 v Strategy: Strengthen Global Efforts With Other Economic Development Priorities 1. Develop economic development relationships with foreign metros - Programs such as the partnership that CenterState CEO is developing with a Chinese trade executive group called CAPPSTE can help provide a cross-industry and cross-cultural exchange of ideas and economic development activities. Through this partnership, CenterState CEO may provide entrepreneurship development support to businesses growing out of Chinese universities. These programs could establish global connections between economic development practitioners and businesses in our region with growing overseas customers. 2. Provide workforce development opportunities to immigrants of all skills - Many of the workforce programs currently in operation in the region have provided meaningful training and employment opportunities for entry-level positions. The region must also focus on helping connect skilled immigrants with areas of high job demand (such as science, engineering, and international business). Investing in a Global Support Ecosystem Over the past years, the region has significantly increased its own investment in global engagement strategies. This investment has been leveraged by federal grants that have made the region's current programs and services possible. To achieve the strategies listed above, the Central New York and Mohawk Valley regions request the consideration of New York State to invest in the following initiatives. Staff support - While the CNYIBA has developed most of the export support programs, curriculum, and services that are demanded by companies in the region, it would need increased staff support to conduct the one-on-one outreach to businesses throughout its proposed expanded service territory. Further, program development support may be needed to help launch new export assistance programs based on the specific needs of businesses in the expanded territory. Development of more support on the ground overseas - A key finding from the CenterState Metro Export Initiative was the need to develop additional overseas support systems for companies in high-priority target markets. The CNYIBA has started to pilot this program with efforts focused on Singapore and the ASEAN countries, but New York could reopen previously closed offices or launch new offices in high-priority countries like Mexico, Japan, South Korea, China, Brazil, and the European Union. Support with existing trade development programs - Both the CNYIBA and the Buffalo Niagara World Trade Center run programs designed to bring companies on trade shows and missions to target markets in Southeast Asia. New York could partner with both of these organizations to provide outreach and lead development support as they attract business participants. Enhance export data tracking - In partnership with each REDC, develop a database of exporting companies. The database could include information such as total exports, top exporting countries, target overseas industries, and persistent obstacles or export assistance needs. Assist metro areas in developing metro export plans - The Brookings Institution has a proven, year-long model that has been used to help metropolitan areas develop comprehensive export plans. New York could encourage and possibly fund the participation in these planning activities to become the only state whose major metro areas all have dedicated export plans. Examine the creation of new export financing tools - Most businesses looking for exporting financing receive support from the Export-Import Bank and the Small Business Administration. Though these offices are helpful, shortcomings in their financing products make it difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to receive financing. New York State could consider providing seed funding to a statewide export financing entity to fill some of these gaps. This was done successfully with a statewide export finance office in California. Coordinate statewide FDI attraction - New York could purchase a pavilion at one of the large foreign direct investment global trade shows (possibly the Hannover Messe) to help promote START-UP NY zones and the individual industry strengths of each REDC. Catalyze local FDI activities - CenterState CEO is piloting a trade and investment program to encourage foreign direct investment from Canadian companies. If these locally developed programs are successful, New York could invest in taking them statewide or replicating them with other target countries. Invest in critical global infrastructure - Strong global infrastructure is not just about having well-maintained roads and bridges. Efficiently moving goods to overseas markets continues to be a critical need for the region's businesses. Assets like the Port of Oswego and projects like the Inland Port should be supported and maintained. Completing the build-out of statewide access to broadband allows companies of all sizes to reach and communicate with businesses around the globe. Develop a statewide talent recruitment and attraction strategy - While the efforts in Central New York, which are supported by the Opportunity Agenda program, have integrated some immigrants into jobs in high demand, the State should focus on attracting and retaining highly skilled immigrants in our globally relevant growth sectors. To do this, the State could facilitate development of a statewide EB-5 office or could provide direct legal immigration assistance to students approaching graduation from SUNY programs.82 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL 5.0 INTRODUCTION Nearly 900,000 military veterans call New York State home, including 50,000 that live, work, and attend school in Central New York. Upstate New York accounts for more than 60 percent of New York's population of military veterans, a percentage that is expected to grow over the next decade as more than 1.5 million soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines transition to civilian life. The region has close social and economic ties to Fort Drum, home to nearly 19,000 active-duty military personnel and 11,000 family members. Veterans offer a powerful and sustainable competitive advantage to the region's current and prospective employers, and a complementary opportunity for the region's educational institutions. The skills, experiences, and training characteristics of military veterans make their companies more dynamic, global, and competitive. Research shows that veterans are inherently entrepreneurial, highly committed, trustworthy, resilient, and adept at transferring and applying skills across different organizational settings. Military veterans are also highly educated: 72 percent of post- 9/11 veterans have college experience; 44 percent have a community college or associate degree; and 28 percent have a bachelor's degree or higher. However, compared to civilians, approximately 90 percent of military spouses are underemployed based on their education, training, or experience, and many of them will be readily available to employers in the next five years. Those veterans requiring additional training and skills development to be competitive in the workforce can be served by the growing number of military connected educational institutions across the region. The region has a strong network of resources and assets that can support these veterans and their families. A network of major employers in the defense and technology sectors is situated across Central New York. Additionally, Syracuse University has emerged as a national leader in the field of the post-service lives of veterans and their families. In the areas of entrepreneurship and business management, Syracuse University has trained more than 22,000 veterans and transitioning military personnel over the past six years with programs across the country and at military installations around the world. Veterans and family members also have resources to assist with that transition, including GI Bill and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs benefits and services. The Central New York region has more than $360 million of VA- related expenditures in Fiscal Year '13, including more than $22 million in education, vocational rehabilitation, and employment spending; more than $200 million in medical care spending; and more than $125 million in compensation and pension spending. New coordination by the CNY REDC with the existing resources already supporting the region's veteran community will ensure those dollars are being spent wisely in concert with other components of the regional economy. Simply put, there is a strong business case for leveraging veteran and military family talent in the civilian workforce, particularly in the face of a competitive and inherently dynamic business environment. Central New York is ready to capitalize on this opportunity. At a time when so many industry leaders compare the business landscape to a battlefield, the advantages of hiring a military veteran \u2014 someone who has experience managing uncertainty and making decisions in a dynamic environment \u2014 should be clear. Leveraging veteran talent as an engine of economic development in Central New York represents a compelling opportunity. By leveraging existing programs and opportunities, CNY REDC is committed to improve local efforts to attract veterans to the region, to retain those who are here, and to focus on assisting those here to engage in education, entrepreneurship, or other activities which would contribute to regional economic development. Such initiatives will greatly improve the number of veterans and family members choosing to return to the region and remain in Central New York. 5.1 M ARKET ASSESSMENT The United States has nearly 23 million veterans. Approximately 2.5 million have served in the military since 9/11. Between 200,000 and 300,000 veterans will leave the service each year for Veterans as a Competitive Advantage in the Central New York Workforce5 Part 5 | VETERANS AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE CENTRAL NEW YORK WORKFORCE : 2014-2015 83 the next five years; figures are then expected to drop to 175,000 veterans, annually. New York State's current veteran population is 885,000 (fourth in the nation, and ninth in currently separating veterans); the Central New York region has more than 50,000 veterans. With this significant population of veterans across the region, state and country \u2014 and with an extraordinary network of veteran resources, support services, and workforce training initiatives \u2014 no other area of the United States is better positioned to support veterans in the civilian workforce, while simultaneously advancing the economic goals of employers, than Central and Upstate New York. With these resources, there is a unique opportunity to attract veterans to Central New York to live and work. Consider the following: Syracuse University's Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF), the nation's premier academic institute focused on advancing the vocational lives of America's veterans and military families, supports veterans and current and prospective employers through a number of services. Robust programs prepare veterans and spouses for civilian careers, teach important skills in navigating a job search and writing a resume, and teach how to translate skills acquired in the military to competencies in the civilian workforce. Comprehensive programming is also available to employers, offering training and support related to veteran cultural competency, career recruitment, hiring, onboarding, retention, and advancement. Additionally, custom training and vocational program development for regional employers builds on the IVMF's partnerships with leading employers of veterans such as GE, Alcoa, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, and USAA. Central New York boasts a pipeline of veteran talent that supports the region's manufacturing and service-centered industries. The Syracuse VA Medical Center is today the No. 1-ranked facility in the VA health care system. The Syracuse VA Medical Center utilizes state-of-the-art technology to provide a full range of patient care services, education, and research. The reputation of the Syracuse VA Medical Center is a major point of attraction for transitioning service members and veterans, influencing the decision to both settle and stay in Central New York. Employer proximity to the Syracuse VA Medical Center supports a stable and sustainable pool of veteran talent. Central New York is home to a growing portfolio of resources to support human resource professionals, peers, managers, recruiters, and private-sector leaders on veteran employment. There are many advanced manufacturing initiatives in the region focused specifically on the veterans' community and spanning across regions in Upstate New York. MACNY supports regional manufacturers with employment-focused and HR programs and also partners with the IVMF to deliver to the region's employers the \"Veteran Employment Leading Practices: Tools for Engaging Veteran Talent.\" In addition, Central New York is a key operating location for Get Skills to Work, an initiative undertaken by GE, Alcoa, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin, in partnership with the IVMF, to promote advanced manufacturing careers to veterans by linking veteran skills to business and industry opportunities in the advanced manufacturing sector. Central New York is home to the Veterans Higher Education Resource Consortium (CNY-VHERC), a group of institutions of higher education collaborating to advance the educational and vocational situation of the region's veterans and families. These institutions work together to support and advance both the educational and vocational goals of the region's veterans, a collaboration that assumes a specific focus on optical, additive, nano-manufacturing, plastics, and traditional manufacturing. Participating institutions represent regions throughout Upstate New York, and include Broome Community College, Bryant and Stratton College, Cayuga Community College, Cazenovia College, Columbia College, Cornell University, Empire State College, Excelsior College, Ithaca College, Jefferson Community College, Le Moyne College, Morrisville State College, SUNY Binghamton, SUNY Canton, SUNY Cortland, SUNY OCC, SUNY Oswego, SUNY Potsdam, Syracuse University, Thomas Edison State College, Tompkins Cortland Community College, Utica College, Utica School of Commerce, and Wells College. The CNY-VHERC provides workforce training and connects employers with skilled and trained veteran talent. 5.2 REC OMMENDED STRATEGIES FOR VETERANS The CNY REDC's Veterans Work Group (Appendix C) is comprised of regional leaders in business, government, and higher education, working to further develop region-wide strategies to ensure that veterans acquire the necessary skills to transition into the Central New York civilian workforce successfully and contribute to regional economic growth. The region's programs and centers all have national reach through extensive partnerships in the private sector and networks of organizations advocating for the social welfare of veterans. The Work Group's charge will be to bring these connections together with Governor Cuomo's initiatives on veteran employment and entrepreneurship and develop coordinated strategies to effectively serve veterans throughout the region and state. The Veterans Work Group, with the support of a regional coalition Vice Chancellor for Veteran and Military Affairs J. Michael Haynie addresses a class of the veterans at Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management.84 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL of veteran resources and expert business leadership, will draw attention to the veteran population and its competitive advantage as a powerful tool for growth. The Veterans Work Group will advance the following strategies to engage veterans, families, business, and industry in the Central New York economy: v Strategy: Better Understand the Veteran Support Ecosystem Catalog and identify all current activities in the region related to veterans to better understand and coordinate best practices in engaging veterans and their families in the regional economy. Identify areas in workforce, education, and entrepreneurial assistance programs that could build on Governor Cuomo's targeted initiatives. START-UP NY and CFA funding awarded to businesses provide opportunities to directly engage and encourage new and expanding businesses to hire veterans. Syracuse University's Institute for Veteran and Military Families (IVMF) will design and implement a skills training program focused toward seeding and growing business ownership opportunities for Central New York veterans, in collaboration with universities in Central New York, aligned with START-UP NY initiatives. The IVMF will partner with the universities and their faculty, technology transfer staff, research centers, and students in this development, and will draw on expertise from CenterState CEO, the Business Council, and other relevant organizations. Build on New York's comprehensive work related to services for veterans and families, focused especially on housing, employment, benefits (including education), and mental health to build additional capacity within education, business and industry to support workforce programs and services. v Strategy: Align Veteran Engagement Activities with the Workforce System Conduct focused outreach to active-duty military personnel and National Guard and Reserve members and their families to promote existing education, employment, and entrepreneurship opportunities that will attract and/or retain them in the region post-service. Leverage national career and employment initiatives through IVMF such as the 100,000 Jobs Mission; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Hiring Our Heroes initiative; Get Skills to Work initiative led by GE, Alcoa, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin focused on advanced manufacturing careers; and the Veteran Career Transition Program, which trains for more than 35 career certificates. IVMF will build a business and industry-focused education initiative, sharing leading practices in employment practices related to veterans. IVMF will collaborate with CenterState CEO, MACNY, and the Business Council to develop the program to meet the needs of regional businesses, and deliver the program in collaboration with experts in human resources, veteran issues, education, and training. Build on the national educational initiatives, including the GI Bill, the Yellow Ribbon tuition program, and programs specifically focused on educating and preparing military members, veterans and family members for their careers. Engage in a marketing and public relations campaign to make business and industry aware of the opportunities related to veterans in the region. v Strategy: Catalyze Veteran Entrepreneurship Engage the entrepreneurship programs and faculty of Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management, including the Falcone Center for Entrepreneurship, the South Side Innovation Center, and joint programs with IVMF on entrepreneurship, veterans, transitioning service members, and spouses. IVMF will develop a two-day veteran entrepreneur education program for regional veterans to be funded in collaboration with the CNY REDC and other business partners. In addition, IVMF will offer an eight-week distance education program and an annual conference for regional veteran business owners that will bring them together with private-sector and government procurement specialists, business development experts, and program service providers. Resources such as the Business Council, CenterState CEO, and the Falcone Center will be engaged to deliver this outcome. Additionally, IVMF will provide education and training to New York State Entrepreneurial Assistance Programs. Engage in a marketing and public relations campaign to make business and industry aware of opportunities related to veterans and entrepreneurship/small business ownership, including: 1. State government contracting and in private industry supply chains; 2. New businesses and growing businesses (START-UP NY, CFA process); 3. The advantages veteran-owned businesses confer in the region, including access to VA Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment funding for business startups. Maria Contreras-Sweet, the Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration, addresses participants of Syracuse University's Women Veterans Igniting the Spirit of Entrepreneurship (V-WISE) conference in New York City in June 2014. Part 5 | VETERANS AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE CENTRAL NEW YORK WORKFORCE : 2014-2015 85 5.3 ALIGN WITH CNY REDC INITIATIVES Central New York is well positioned to include veterans and their families in each of the areas identified by the CNY REDC as core to its efforts. Plans such as START UP-NY, Entrepreneurial Assistance Programs, and New York State's new policy to set aside up to six percent of state purchasing for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses (SDVOSBs) provide significant resources and incentives to engage with veterans as part of regional efforts to improve the economy. The council's targeted industry clusters have many aspects which veterans may be uniquely prepared to contribute to. Advanced Manufacturing in Thermal and Environmental Control Systems (AM-TEC) Veterans have specific skills, education, and training related to environmental controls for HVAC, air purification, hazardous material remediation, water supply, and other focused areas in advanced manufacturing in thermal and environmental control systems (AM-TEC). These skills include training related to hazardous environment on the battlefield, secure facilities for hazardous materials, projects and facilities requiring exacting environmental control and monitoring, and treaty verification and monitoring. Veterans have experience on environmental systems necessary to maintain safe and secure facilities for command and control, data processing, building and maintaining sensitive systems, high performance environments, and closed environmental systems (e.g., nuclear navy and submarine programs). In general, the significant military training that veterans receive on process and procedure, exacting detail and meticulously following instructions, attention to safety and regulation, and other related factors have relevance in this area. Additionally, veterans have experience in many field situations serving locales around the world in emergency response after hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. These services include providing clean water, heating, cooling, and power generation, including alternative energy sources such as solar and wind. Veteran workforces also have benefitted from initiatives such as Veterans Green Jobs and related programs preparing them for careers in the energy sector. Health, Biomedical Services and Biosciences Veterans are trained and educated for health, biomedical services, biosciences, and related disciplines. Research conducted for the National Science Foundation on STEM precursors for veterans found veterans well-educated, with relevant experience, skills, traits and characteristics, but without sufficient knowledge of STEM education and career potential. There are extensive numbers of medical technicians, lab technicians, nurses, physicians, emergency medical personnel, X-ray and other imaging technicians, many of whom need only civilian certification and licensure to validate their training and experience. Nationally, many states and educational institutions are providing such programs for transition, and an effort to replicate these programs in the region would add to the economic clusters here in health and related disciplines. Syracuse University in particular has a special opportunity to drive the growth and development in regenerative medicine and rehabilitation engineering by working with veterans and teaming with existing partners: 1. Syracuse University's L.C. Smith College of Engineering and Computer Science operates the Rehabilitative and Regenerative Engineering Program, which focuses on the regeneration of tissues, limbs, and organs; the development of assistive technologies for rehabilitative treatment; and the application of systems engineering approaches to the patient experience from surgery through follow-up rehabilitation. With the potential for collaborations with clinical researchers \u2014 including those in the Syracuse VA, SUNY Upstate Medical University, and others \u2014 this area has significant promise related to educating, hiring, and serving veterans. 2. Syracuse University faculty work with the New York State Adult Career and Continuing Education Services- Vocational Rehabilitation program and the University's Burton Blatt Institute to provide counseling services to help disabled individuals make informed decisions on the acquisition of assistive vehicle technology. Syracuse University has the only program that is working to train engineers and technicians so this needed service sector can expand. 3. Syracuse University's L.C. Smith College of Engineering and Computer Science excels in the field of intelligent systems engineering. This field focuses on developing rehabilitation approaches that are affordable and adaptable to a patient's needs and environments. In combining these areas, a systems approach considers the patient experience from surgery to subsequent rehabilitation, sustained improvement in quality of life, and finally to the resumption of normal life activit ies, an area of extreme importance to wounded veterans and their families. CNY is well positioned to further develop this field by coordinating between the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation engineering, Syracuse University work in engineering and computer science, the VA's rehabilitation mission, and IVMF's policy and veteran focus. Financial Services Veterans are engaged with the financial services sector through programs like Veterans on Wall Street, and with companies including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citi, and other national and regional banks. Microfinance organizations such as Kiva, Kiva-Zip, and Accion, as well as education and training programs funded by the financial industry have attracted thousands of veterans to the field. Additionally, Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management has educated Department of Defense comptrollers for more than 60 years. Banks such as JPMorgan Chase also lead the way in considering veterans for both front- and back-office positions, including programs to rotate veterans through assignments leading to Strengthen Targeted Industry Concentrations that Leverage Unique Economic Assets86 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL branch manager positions. The financial services sector has key veteran career initiatives related to sourcing veteran and spouse talent that may be leveraged in Central New York to attract workforce members. Agribusiness and Food Processing Many veterans have extensive experience related to food, food packaging, nutrition, and transportation logistics necessary to support a deployed military, humanitarian aid, and other factors. Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management educates government employees to understand, develop, manage, and lead the complex integration of goods, services and distribution in a variety of critical and tactical situations with the master of science in supply chain management (which may be relevant in this sector, in advanced manufacturing, and Data to Decisions). Additionally, farm-to-table and other veteran farming programs may provide resources and incentives to veterans to locate in Central New York. Culinary programs such as one offered in fall 2014 by Clear Path for Veterans to teach veterans to become chefs and restaurateurs will be useful in engaging veterans . Advanced Manufacturing Advanced manufacturing (including digital electronics, radar and sensor systems, security, information technology, and defense) is an area well suited to the recruitment of veterans into regional education and employment opportunities. Information technology is well understood and heavily used by military members, who are often involved in developing requirements, understanding and interpreting requirements and uses, and in the underlying systems integration, design, manufacture, deployment and use of such systems. Major defense contractors understand their affinity with these systems and hire them. Non-defense systems can likewise benefit from veterans' deep understanding of the systems and components. Attracting veterans as students may additionally advantage regional educational institutions' students, faculty, staff, as well as R&D efforts, technology transfer, and related areas. Tourism Military veterans and family members often have foreign language skills and are culturally competent to engage with members of other cultures and from many countries. With much of the region's tourism being related to agricultural and viticulture, this could be a growth area that attracts veterans and families with these skills to the area. Programs like IVMF's Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities program, and its expansion at Cornell University focused on hospitality-related businesses, could be utilized for the tourism industry to train and educate veterans and families considering relocating to the region. Data to Decisions Military veterans have education, training, and experience in targeted areas focused on Data to Decisions, whether in advanced intelligence, data analysis, or field-level operations planning. In the areas of cybersecurity, information assurance, and related topical areas, Syracuse University has a strong presence that has not yet been fully leveraged to attract and retain military veterans here. U.S. News & World Report ranks Syracuse University's School of Information Studies (iSchool) number one in best online graduate degree programs in computer information technology for veterans. The programs offered in residence, via distance education, and relevant recognition include the following: Syracuse University offers two master's degree programs for Army officers on using and managing information and communications technologies. Soldiers who have completed military training may transfer nine to 15 credits Driving Progress: Get Skills to Work Syracuse University's Institute for Veteran and Military Families (IVMF) engaged with GE, Alcoa, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, TechShop, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Manufacturing Institute, and others to create the Get Skills to Work initiative. Get Skills to Work is a veteran and business/industry partnership in advanced manufacturing, including education in advanced manufacturing for veterans. Beginning in fall 2014, SUNY OCC will offer a certificate in advanced manufacturing and machining, a one-year certificate program to provide the skills necessary for employment in the machining industry. Graduates will be able to apply for positions such as machinists and apprentices, machine operators, tool and die makers, machine setters, and tool grinders. Many of these programs are eligible for GI Bill funding and coordinate with statewide economic development initiatives, including in Central New York. Building a high- quality workforce that includes veterans will strengthen the region, and because many veterans have held security clearances, they bring added skills to certain manufacturers engaged in the defense industry and can engage in classified R&D efforts in this and other focus areas. The Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with Disabilities and other programs developed by Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management and the Institute for Veterans and Military families has trained over 22,000 veterans, active duty military personnel, and family members since 2006. Part 5 | VETERANS AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE CENTRAL NEW YORK WORKFORCE : 2014-2015 87 toward an M.S. in information management or M.S. in telecommunications and network management at the iSchool. The agreement also allows active soldiers\u2014many of whom may be deployed overseas\u2014to complete the master's degree requirements through online courses. Retired Army officers may also enroll in the campus or the online programs. Since 1998, the iSchool has partnered with the National Defense University's Information Resources Management College (iCollege). Through this partnership, the iSchool offers graduates of selected iCollege certificate programs enrollment in its executive master's degree or professional doctorate program with advanced standing. The National Security Agency and the federal Department of Homeland Security recently named Syracuse University a National Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Information Assurance/Cyber Defense (IA/CD) institution. In addition, the University was reaffirmed as an institution for CAE-R (research) programs. Both designations are effective through 2021. CAE programs reduce vulnerability in the national information infrastructure by promoting education and research in information assurance/cyber defense education and research across a range of academic disciplines. Students attending CAE IA/CD (education) and CAE-R (research) schools are eligible for scholarships and grants through the Department of Defense Information Assurance Scholarship Program and the Federal Cyber Service Scholarship for Service Program. The iSchool offers a Certificate of Advanced Study in Information Security Management. The 15-credit program provides students with the flexibility to take coursework that does not overlap with their expertise, while giving them tools in information security technology, policy, risk management, and evaluation. The certificate is available to those with or without previous experience in the information technology field. IVMF operates the Veterans Career Transition Program, which is delivered at no cost to post-9/11 veterans. Through online courses veterans have the opportunity to gain an understanding and insight into the corporate culture of civilian industry, government, and other civilian sector employment opportunities. Technology tracks include approximately 29 specializations and certifications in data and security areas. Syracuse Universitys Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism operates a Certificate of Advanced Studies in Security Studies that includes cybersecurity policy and law. Improving the region's competitiveness begins by having a highly educated, talented and creative workforce to fuel the growth of businesses throughout Central New York. Through the region's Improve Competitiveness in, and Connections to, the Regional, National, and International Economiesuniversities and colleges, veterans are receiving the education and training that will make Central New York competitive in the global economy. The region is also home to a number of national initiatives that assist businesses, both small and large, to place veterans into careers. Higher Education Services and Opportunities Entrepreneurship programs offered by the Department of Defense and the Small Business Administration, and developed by Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management and IVMF, have educated more than 22,000 transitioning military members in the past seven years and will provide education to an estimated 13,000 to 17,000 veterans over the next three years. Additionally, IVMF has multiple other entrepreneurship programs for wounded veterans, caregivers, women veterans, as well as veterans and spouses around the country regardless of their era of services. These educate, on average, between 2,000 and 3,000 veterans and spouses annually and are conducted by two schools in New York State, Syracuse University and Cornell University, and six others nationally, including Florida State University, Texas A&M, UCLA, Louisiana State University, Purdue University, and the University of Connecticut. With focused effort, the Central New York region could be seen as a destination for veteran entrepreneurs. In addition to training programs in entrepreneurship, Syracuse University received a grant from the Graduate Management Admissions Council to focus on creating a talented veteran workforce through accelerated, tracked, and specialized management degrees and certificates. This grant provided veterans the following focused efforts: Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management M.B.A. for Veterans with the Defense Comptrollership Program M.S. in Entrepreneurship with the Department of Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises Certificate of Advanced Studies in Entrepreneurship with the Department of Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises In development, a proposal for an online M.S. in Entrepreneurship with the Department of Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs - Executive M.P .A. Syracuse University's David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics - M.S. in Sport Venue and Event Management Syracuse University's iSchool Certificate of Advanced Studies in e-Government Management and Leadership and Information Security Management Syracuse University's L.C. Smith College of Engineering and Computer Science - proposed recruitment of veterans for an online M.S. in Engineering Management Furthermore, Syracuse University established the Veterans Resource Center in 2009 within University College to provide veterans and their families with the services needed as they pursue their education. In the last five years the Veterans Resource Center has served more than 300 veterans and their families. 88 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL The Veterans Resource Center has several programs in place to support student veterans and their families: Veterans' Educational Benefits provide support and guidance for accessing funding Under the Yellow Ribbon tuition program, Syracuse University pays half of uncovered costs for tuition and mandatory fees Syracuse University Student Veterans Organization's mission is to provide information resources and advocacy in support of all SU student veterans and to assist them toward graduation Veterans Lounge where veteran students can meet, study, and relax on campus and close to Syracuse VA Syracuse University is a participant in the VA's Veterans Success on Campus program, with a full-time counselor on campus Veterans Work Study Program funded by the VA allows the Veterans Resource Center to hire eight students part time during the academic year Academic Honors Program recognizes academic achievement of student veterans through the national veterans honor society known as SALUTE Graduating student veterans are acknowledged with red, white, and blue honor cord to wear at graduation ceremonies and events Through Syracuse University's Talent and Education Development Center (TED Center) veterans are able to use their GI Bill benefits to obtain education that supports industry-recognized credentials leading to high-wage, high-demand occupations in the civilian workforce. Workforce Placement and Certification Programs Syracuse University's Institute for Veteran and Military Families is engaged with business and industry partners in the regional, national, and global economies focusing on employment and career initiatives for veterans, transitioning military members and spouses. This engagement includes collaborations such as the 100,000 Jobs Mission. Local and regional business members include JPMorgan Chase, CSX, KPMG, Iron Mountain, AT&T, Securitas, Cushman and Wakefield, Delta, Office Depot, BAE Systems (in the Mohawk Valley region), JB Hunt, Time Warner, Bristol-Myers Squibb, IBM, Lockheed Martin, JCPenney, Anheuser Busch, Eaton, Target, Verizon and Chipotle, and 162 member companies, most in the Fortune 500. IVMF is also part of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Hiring Our Heroes coalition, which engages nationally with more than 300 member companies pledging to hire veterans and spouses. With nearly 500 Get Skills to Work partner companies, more than 162 100,000 Jobs Mission member companies, and more than 300 Hiring Our Heroes members, there may also be opportunities to engage those businesses to consider Central New York as a business location and as a source of business partners, suppliers, or other business relationships. A concerted effort to identify business connections, regional university alumni, individuals with ties to CNY, and business interests tied to regional resources and assets, focusing on veterans, veteran-owned businesses, and veteran alumni is underway. Additionally, the New York State Council on Returning Veterans and their Families has worked to develop certification and licensure, as well as education credits, for returning veterans entering professions that include: Advanced Emergency Medical Armed Security Guard Bus Driver Certified First Responder Crane Operator Emergency Medical Technician Home Health Aide Home Nurse Aide Licensed Radiological Technologist Personal Care Security Guard Tractor Trailer Operator Truck Driver The State University of New York and the City University of New York Experience Counts programs are aimed to improve their processes for awarding credit for military training. Further, the Department of Health will allow military training and experience as a medic to count toward certification for home health aides and nursing home aides, as it already does for certification as a paramedic. Regional businesses have yet to utilize these incentives for certification and licensure. Combined with specific career, education, and entrepreneurship initiatives in the Central New York region, these initiatives could assist with attracting a well- qualified and experienced workforce to the region, or retaining veterans already in the region. New York State Department of Labor Support and One Stop Services The New York State Department of Labor uses the Jobs for Veterans state grant program to perform outreach to employers. Funds are provided to states to fund two staff positions: Local Veterans' Employment Representatives (LVER) and Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program (DVOP) specialists. LVERs conduct outreach to employers in the area to assist veterans in gaining employment and facilitate employment, training, and placement services. DVOP specialists provide intensive services and facilitate placements to meet employment needs of veterans, prioritizing service to special disabled veterans, and other disabled veterans. DVOP specialists and LVERs are an essential part of and fully integrated into the American Job Center One Stop Career Center network. They work at the Career Centers, where the New York State Department of Labor maintains a database of Employers and Job Orders listed by local employers in the New York State Job Bank. As an integral part of performing their jobs, they work closely with other center staff and partners that Part 5 | VETERANS AS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN THE CENTRAL NEW YORK WORKFORCE : 2014-2015 89 provide labor services, including resume writing and critique, job referrals to local employers, and conduct workshops teaching resume writing, interviewing, networking, online job search and application, social media, basic computer workshops, basic email workshops, and adult literacy. Small Business Administration Supporting veteran entrepreneurship is a major strategic objective of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). By partnering with local organizations such as IVMF and through a network of SBA-funded resource partners in the region, including the Small Business Development Center, SCORE, and the WISE Women's Business Center, SBA provides free one-on-one counseling, mentoring, and training to veterans at any stage of business ownership. SBA also educates and assists service-disabled veteran-owned businesses (SDVOBs) in taking advantage of the federal government's three percent contracting goal for SDVOBs. To increase veteran access to capital to fund their venture, SBA currently waives loan guaranty fees to veterans for loans up to $350,000. A fundamental component to economic development and the council's efforts over the past three years is developing strong, stable communities. The council believes its veteran strategy, is an essential component of sustaining strong communities across the region. IVMF is engaged with communities across New York State to support veterans and their families in community reintegration, to support health outcomes, employment outcomes, and to prevent or respond to homelessness. Efforts in 2013 led to 20 organizations across the state tripling the amount of VA funding earmarked to serve New York State veterans' families, from $8.2 million to more than $24 million. This work has been well received by the Department of Veterans Affairs. IVMF has engaged in related work in New York City focused on careers, services, and entrepreneurship, and has engaged veteran-serving organizations, city agencies, state agencies, national initiatives, and philanthropic support to build a service delivery and referral system for veterans and their families. This has provided quick stability to those in need and assisted with community re- integration post-service. This strengthens cities, business districts, and neighborhoods, and is replicable in the CNY region. Additional efforts have been focused on homes for veterans, particularly service-disabled veterans, and including revitalizing homes, building modifications for disability accommodations, and other related activities. The council is currently working to assist the development of a project proposed at the Syracuse Inner Harbor that will provide affordable apartments for veterans, senior veterans, and others with disabilities. The project would also include a Veteran's One Stop Center that will provide wrap-around services, connecting veterans to the community and other veteran resources. The council is requesting state resources be made available to support Veterans One Stop Centers.These initiatives could be expanded in the CNY region with its stock of affordable housing and housing in need of rehabilitation. Utilizing the Entrepreneurial Assistance Programs, business incubators, and other resources, veteran homeowners and entrepreneurs will help revitalize these neighborhoods. Furthermore, the Central New York Veterans Higher Education Regional Consortium is another important asset available to communities in the region and across Upstate New York. More than 50 institutions of higher education, business and industry, and government partners are collaborating to open their communities to veteran students attending colleges and universities, therefore increasing the available workforce while allowing access to veteran vocational education and rehabilitation. 1 Governor Cuomo's administration and the New York State Legislature have both been engaged in creating and modifying programs to encourage veterans to locate in New York State, to start businesses, to supply government with goods and services, and to pursue education in the state. Programs include certification and licensure for veterans who are drivers and heavy equipment operators, and in the future will include medical fields. The state's Entrepreneurial Assistance Program (EAP) includes a new focus on assisting veterans with starting and growing businesses (the Falcone Center at Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management is the designated EAP for Central New York). Recent legislation set aside six percent of New York government purchasing of goods and services for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses.

And the recent tax-free entrepreneurial program, START-UP NY, has strong opportunities for veteran-owned businesses and for those businesses to hire veterans and family members and to provide tax advantages to them as employees. Expertise in Disability Lastly, Syracuse University has long been a hub for disability issues, from disability rights and policy to innovations in disability-related technology, accommodations, and inclusion. Wounded veterans and their family members may benefit from being employees, students, or engaged in the regional economic activities drawing on research and innovation in the region. Partnerships with SUNY ESF, SUNY Upstate Medical University, and the Syracuse VA \u2014 such as the Hill Collaboration for Wounded Warrior Research \u2014 build R&D programs centered on important Defense Department research. Areas of emphasis include neural and spinal cord injury and repair, regenerative medicine, behavioral disorders, post-traumatic stress disorders, traumatic brain injury, infectious diseases and emerging pathogens. This collaboration integrates the disciplines of medicine, science, and engineering and brings novel research and development approach to health care issues affecting active-duty personnel and veterans. A significant collaboration was conducted in 2013/2014 with the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress to better understand military family transition, stress, resilience and wellbeing. This multi- and interdisciplinary approach to issues building on regional competencies to inform national engagement is a model for other clusters. These programs can strengthen our communities by forging relationships across universities and departments to engage in issues important to veterans and bring them into our community, retain them, and assist with integration into the workforce and education systems of Central New York.

Through the first two quarters of 2014, the Public Participation Work Group (PPWG) has held four Regional Forums, two Work Shops, two outreach events, and one Small Business Outreach Survey. We' re well on pace to accomplish our goals set out in the five year plan, and to eclipse them. Additionally, the goal set for year three of th e plan is to have engaged more than 800 Central New York residents. The PPWG has currently engaged 1,445 residents, already passing the 5 year goal of engaging 1000 citizens as part of the five year implementation plan. PPWG events and attendance figures are attached. The final goal set for year three by the CNY REDC was to have a statewide forum to utilize the CNY region's central location, which was accomplished on 4/9/14 when the CNY REDC was afforded the opportunity to host the Round 4 Leadership Work Group Session . \"Taking the Pulse\" The Taking the pulse survey has been continued at each year's Great New York State Fair, in an attempt to measure how effective the CNY REDC has been in getting its message out to the general public. As the fair will take place after this progress report's submission, data is not yet available from this year's survey. The shift to \"It's About You\" Additionally, a new \"It's about you\" effort has been undertaken . Th rough the new campaign, the PPWG is looking into how we can better serve smaller organizations in CNY community, and more specifically, to engage small er businesses than the process has previously reached. A first \"It's about you\" PPWG meeting was held, and an initial survey was sent out via email and Facebook, in an attempt to see how we may better engage businesses that may not be large enough to consider multimillion dollar expansions. The main goal is to engage those who may see the $25m prize pool as so daunting that it may be prohibitive for them to get involved in the process. While some smaller businesses may not be big enough to take on major construction or equipment purchases, there remains a major benefit to them and the local economy if we can help them to receive some of the work these larger projects often lead to. 10 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL APPENDIX D 1 Street Address Address 2 Phone : 555.555.0125 E-mail address Although the \"It's A bout You\" efforts are in the ir infancy, several ideas have already begun to percolate from the PPWG's efforts. Ways to increase public participation among small business owners and increase benefits to our local economy could be assisted through increasing the registration of MWBE's in CNY, creation of local venders l ist to help local contractors bid on the RFPs of awardees, or an Expo event hosted by the REDC to help awardees find local vendors. The suggestion of a small business outreach committee was suggested to take on some of these tasks. Public Participation Action Plan/Changes: Many Public Participation Work Group efforts have been successful and will be continued through the rest of this year and into next year's cycle. The work group plans to continue its course on Public Participation Forums and CFA Workshops. Open forums will continue to help us receive public feedback, and will continue to provide an avenue for showcasing successful projects to the public through our established featured project presentations. CFA Workshops have been invaluable and will continue to be used to help the public with the finer points of receiving funding through the CFA process. STRATEGIC PLAN UPDATE: 2014-2015 APPENDIX D 11 APPENDIX D 2 Regional Economic Development Council Central New York Region Small Business Public Meeting SUNY Oswego Metro Center Thursday June 19, 2014 Ideas and dialogue proposed / discussed during the meeting: \"Printed news or announcements of REDC projects does not always get to me, I would prefer an email or some electronic form of communication\". Some small business members are wondering where REDC progress is advertised, where they can find updates, etc. Several requests to engage with community and business owners o Give small businesses the opportunity to compete for contracts for large scale projects that receive funding (RFP-style) Idea proposed to create a \"preferred vendor list\" in which small businesses that have worked with REDC in the past are recommended to funding award winners Encourage more minority and women-owned businesses to become certified to t ake on contract work for REDC awarded projects The gentleman from the Syracuse New Times proposed that the New Times could be the media outlet to better inform the public and business owners about contract opportunities There must be more advocates for the REDC program and more \"success stories\" similar to Syracuse Office Supply (SOS) that will encourage other small businesses in CNY to explore opportunities within the REDC program Most small business members need an incentive to attend meetings like this, that incentive is not strong enough at this point Create more visibility to inform small business owners: billboards, local media and news print o Utilize local chamber of commerce sites and newsletters At the next board meeting the idea should be proposed for a \"small business subcommittee\" within the larger REDC board. Andrew Fish plans to motion for this. The CFA application process has been a daunting task, there needs to be a better way to navigate this process or provide assistance. If that assistance already exist, then finding ways to inform business owners to allow them to have better odds at a strong application CenterState CEO will be holding a trade show at the End of October. Jane Amico mentioned this as an opportunity to connect awarded projects with small businesses (if the timing of the event & the awards is in sync) There should be an \"Ex po-event\" in which large scale REDC projects welcome small businesses to pitch their services for various contracts related to the project. An example was mentioned for the Nanotechnology site in Marcy, NY in which dozens of businesses met with officials f rom the nano- project in a venue that was standing -room -only due to the large draw 12 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL N YS Consolidated Funding Application Endorsement StandardsSTRATEGIC PLAN UPDATE: 2014-2015 APPENDIX E 13 NYS Consolidated Funding Application (CFA) 19Review and Score CFAs Each Regional Council will review and rank applications based on a set of standards, referred to as \"endorsement standards. \" Regional Councils will assign each project a single score of 20, 15, 10, 5 or 0 (no fractions) based on merit. The Regional Council endorsement will account for 20% of the total review. Endorsement Standards Each Regional Council will utilize statewide endorsement standards when reviewing CFAs submitted to their region. Regional Councils will take into account the degree to which the application helps implement the regional strategic plan. Applicants may take these standards into account when preparing applications.
