Describe who peer support providers are and what they do. Explain the role of peer support providers in PSR services and recovery.Medical Model Approach to Assessment & Treatment Assessment : Identify symptoms the person is experiencing.

Stabilize the person so the person stays out of the hospital. The person remains compliant with treatment (ex. taking prescribed medication). Example treatment approaches : Prescribe medication. Refer the person for individual psychotherapy and/or group therapy. While important, the medical model approach only addresses appropriate diagnosis and symptom management of a mental illness.Recovery Model Approach to Assessment & Treatment The recovery model looks at mental illness symptoms as barriers in the way of the person achieving his/her life goals. This model focuses on looking at personal strengths, individual courage, self- esteem, problem-solving skills, coping mechanisms, therapy, and hope. In the recovery model, medications, psychotherapy, and other more traditional treatments still have an important role, but symptom reduction and/or management is not the end goal. The main goals are to maximize the individual's abilities and opportunities to achieve important personal goals around work, education, relationships, meaningful roles, and overall wellness. Symptom management occurs in service of these larger life goals. Psychosocial rehabilitation (PSR) services address the dysfunctions, disabilities, and disadvantages associated with mental illnesses .Why should the VA health care system care about the Recovery Model?

VHA Handbook 1160.01, Uniform Mental Health Services in VA Medical Centers and Clinics (2008) :States the minimum clinical requirements for VA mental health services and notes that the mental health services must be recovery-oriented.What is recovery?
