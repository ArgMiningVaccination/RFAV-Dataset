In this essay we discuss how the practice of Nature Cure provides a way of understanding the scale and scope of the crisis, as it is embodied, and a way to understand key elements of a solution to problems that the crisis presents for institutionalized health care. As institutionalized in contemporary India, Nature Cure involves treatment and managed care using earth, air, sunlight, and water as well as a strict dietary regimen. In this regard, the essay shows how Nature Cure's bio-ecological orientation toward public health, which is grounded in the history of its modern incorporation into India, provides an expansionist, ecological model for holistic care that counters the reductionist logic of bio-medical pharmaceuticalization.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2017-12-07", "cleaned_text": "Nature Cure and Non-Communicable Diseases: Ecological Therapy as Health Care in India [https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph14121525](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph14121525) Abstract: 1. Introduction [6](#B6-ijerph-14-01525)]. [7](#B7-ijerph-14-01525)]. Just as reductionism presumes that efficacy at the level of the individual is what is ultimately important and of absolute value, expansionism involves a more dialectical logic in which a person's health is subsumed into a synthesis that is inherently bio-ecological [ [8](#B8-ijerph-14-01525)]. To be sure, expansionism has problems and limitations, but we are interested in understanding how holism is embodied and the operational structure of community health based on the embodied materialism of ecological principles. In other words, we focus on the manipulation of bodies in the environment as a means of producing an improved sense of health and wellbeing rather than on ideals and the disembodied idealism of healing as an end unto itself. 2. Nature Cure and the Crisis of Public Health in Contemporary India 2.1. Nature Cure: Practice and Theory [9](#B9-ijerph-14-01525), [10](#B10-ijerph-14-01525)], Nature Cure in India\u2014including, perhaps most surprisingly, the practice of asana and pranayama\u2014reflects a distinctly modernized articulation of early 20th century radical theory and practice as articulated by German secular pragmatists who were less mystically inspired than mechanically inclined to bring nature into the urban world of the new middle-class [ [11](#B11-ijerph-14-01525)]. This techno-holism makes Nature Cure more relevant to 21st century public health issues in India than is the case with other medical systems [ [8](#B8-ijerph-14-01525), [12](#B12-ijerph-14-01525)]. [13](#B13-ijerph-14-01525), [14](#B14-ijerph-14-01525)]. 2.2. Non-Communicable Diseases: The Indian Crisis in Global Perspective [15](#B15-ijerph-14-01525)]. Fifty-three percent of all deaths are now correlated with Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, 24%, COPD, 11%, cancer, 6%, diabetes, 2%. A range of other chronic diseases make up the remaining 10% [ [16](#B16-ijerph-14-01525)]. Having declined significantly over the course of the past 50 years, 36% of all deaths are still correlated with communicable diseases, maternal and prenatal health problems, and nutritional deficiency [ [17](#B17-ijerph-14-01525)]. Although it stands out on several measures, India is by no means unique. A 2011 conference organized under the auspices of the WHO produced some striking statistics on NCDs in the context of international and global health [ [18](#B18-ijerph-14-01525)]. What is striking is that the steady decrease in infectious diseases reflects a profound shift in the burden of disease within a relatively compressed period of time. Between 2005 and 2015 alone the WHO projected that there would be a 15% reduction in deaths caused by nutritional deficiency, maternal and infant health problems and communicable diseases [ [19](#B19-ijerph-14-01525)]. This is obviously good. But it is also indicative of a serious public health problem, namely the complex morbidity of those who live longer. One approach would be to conceptualize the problem holistically and develop solutions that build on this conceptualization. [20](#B20-ijerph-14-01525), [21](#B21-ijerph-14-01525)]. There has also been a dramatic increase in the incidences of diabetes [ [22](#B22-ijerph-14-01525), [23](#B23-ijerph-14-01525)]. [24](#B24-ijerph-14-01525)]. Globally 63% percent of all deaths are caused by NCDs, of which 25% or 9.1 million are premature and avoidable. Ninety percent of premature deaths from NCDs occur in low and lower middle-income countries, with heart disease and stroke being the leading cause. Based on projections, the number of premature deaths from heart disease will increase from 6.1 to 8.2 million in low income countries, and from 7.3 to 9 million in lower middle-income countries. In upper middle income countries the death rate is projected to remain steady at 2.6 million. In developing countries, the top 10 risk factors correlated with premature deaths are all for NCDs. 6.2 million deaths can be attributed to high blood pressure, which leads all other factors including tobacco use by over 2.3 million. By comparison, 2.7 million deaths can be attributed to high blood glucose which constitutes the third greatest risk factor for premature death. This is followed by physical inactivity, to which 2.6 million deaths can be attributed [ [25](#B25-ijerph-14-01525), [26](#B26-ijerph-14-01525), [27](#B27-ijerph-14-01525), [28](#B28-ijerph-14-01525), [29](#B29-ijerph-14-01525), [30](#B30-ijerph-14-01525)]. [19](#B19-ijerph-14-01525)]. Given this larger, impact, as well as the multidimensional structure of risk\u2014involving the food industry, private and public medical services and a spectrum of life style issues that have a bearing on physical activity\u2014the WHO has pointed out that NCDs present a major political challenge and problem for development and are not just a problem of public health. [31](#B31-ijerph-14-01525)]. [32](#B32-ijerph-14-01525)]. Deep and extensive chains of production, processing, marketing and distribution generate a phenomenal array of packaged goods, ranging from basic, branded staple commodities to highly refined specialty \"health food\" items constituted of artificial ingredients that remove the risk of sugars, fats and salt. Commodity chains that link point of production to point of sale to point of consumption are rightly targeted by governments for regulation, but market dynamics and a porous global economy often works against these regulations, as in the case of tobacco. In terms of food production and processing, a simple intervention involves the replacement of trans fats with polyunsaturated fats. But the real, operational problem is at the level of enforcement and labeling, as these are only really effective when supported by a structure of economic incentives and risk awareness education. [33](#B33-ijerph-14-01525)]. In the discussion which follows we show that institutionalized Nature Cure provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the scale and scope of the crisis in contemporary India, as it is embodied, and that it is within this framework that radical forms of treatment using earth, air, sunlight, water and dietetics constitute a holistic form of medical intervention and management. 2.3. Nature Cure in the Context of Indian Health Care [34](#B34-ijerph-14-01525)]. Until recently the administration of these different systems was centralized under the auspices of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Since 2014, all non-biomedical systems of health care are organized within the Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy) [ [35](#B35-ijerph-14-01525)]. Politics, education and economics are important to consider in understanding the history of India's policy on AYUSH pluralism [ [36](#B36-ijerph-14-01525), [37](#B37-ijerph-14-01525), [38](#B38-ijerph-14-01525)]. Similarly, the changing landscape of global health has shaped and will continue to reshape various systems of medicine in their local articulation. Thus, health tourism is having a powerful impact on ayurvedic practice, especially in Kerala and Uttarakhand [ [39](#B39-ijerph-14-01525), [40](#B40-ijerph-14-01525)]. Religious nationalism has contributed to the institutionalization of distinctions between ayurveda, unani and siddha, despite histories of continuity and shared knowledge [ [41](#B41-ijerph-14-01525), [42](#B42-ijerph-14-01525)]. In terms of globalization, the practice of yoga has become iconic of the relationship among spirituality, self-discipline, health and physical fitness [ [43](#B43-ijerph-14-01525), [44](#B44-ijerph-14-01525)]. [45](#B45-ijerph-14-01525), [46](#B46-ijerph-14-01525)]. The industrialization of ayurveda, unani, siddha and homeopathy is clearly manifest in the scale and scope of international pharmaceutical companies such as Dabur, Himalaya and Hamdard. To some extent the commercialization of AYUSH systems reflects consumer demand for alternatives to biomedicine, although \"demand\" is probably generated as much by marketing as anything else [ [31](#B31-ijerph-14-01525)]. Pharmaceutical companies profit as a consequence of the fact that distress is symptomatic of human biology. Any and all forms of medicine are only provisionally and contingently successful in saving lives and eliminating pain. People want more from medicine than can be provided by medicine, particularly as it tends to be professionalized and institutionalized. Nevertheless, in their complex, fully medicalized plurality, AYUSH systems highlight the way in which public health concerns are not directly congruent with reductive, pharmaceutical interventions, or with the practice of remedial medicine as such. [12](#B12-ijerph-14-01525)]. [36](#B36-ijerph-14-01525)]. Although many people find it difficult to fully appreciate, Gandhi believed, fundamentally, that the violence in medicine was as serious a problem as communal violence, racial prejudice and colonial oppression in society at large. As reflected in his program of action, Nature Cure and diet reform provided the means by which the body could take on moral and ethical significance in community development and constructive work. As such, the health of the body was programmatically connected to the health and welfare of the community and the nation as a whole, and this connection was intimate, direct and grounded in action rather than idealistically figurative or purely symbolic of abstract correlations. [11](#B11-ijerph-14-01525), [36](#B36-ijerph-14-01525)]. Indeed, Nature Cure's reactionary and critical perspective on medical practice is countercultural rather than normative, but also active and contemporary rather than anachronistic. To be sure, its development was inspired by ideas and practices associated with sacred springs and mineral baths in medieval Europe. However, from the very beginning of its formal conception Nature Cure has continued to evolve into a self-consciously modern form of practice fully engaged with technology and mechanized forms of industrial modernity. It is not based on the aesthetic principles of picturesque romanticism, or on a mystical sense of rustic empathy with pristine, wild nature. [8](#B8-ijerph-14-01525)]. Thus, Nature Cure may be understood in terms of the embodiment of opposition to alienating features of work and labor during the course of a key demographic transition from rural agricultural production to capital accumulation and wage labor. As one dimension of this, it also reflects a critical reaction against the industrialized, mass production of food, perhaps most clearly articulated in Sylvester Graham's advocacy for whole wheat alternatives to bleached and chemically processed flour in 19th century New England, and the consolidation of advocacy against meat eating as expressed in the principles of the International Vegetarian Union of Germany in the early 20th century. The specific social class dynamics of this broad movement are undoubtedly complex and multi-dimensional, involving fine grained distinctions of displaced self-doubt, self-reflexive critiques of conspicuous consumption, as well as a kind of middle-class Rousseauian romanticism that took shape as bourgeois nostalgia for rural life in the countryside, but without the critical insight of historical memory for what peasant life was really like. In any case, the cultural history of Nature Cure is intimately linked to a social history of class distinctions on a global scale. [43](#B43-ijerph-14-01525)]. These individuals\u2014on the \"margins of the fringe\", even when in positions of significant wealth and power\u2014were likeminded as a result of their critical perspective on the public health consequences of modernity. They also held similar views on the relatively new culture of mass consumption that characterized the global middle-class at the turn of the century. Thus, one of the most important things that distinguishes Nature Cure from other AYUSH systems of medicine is the fact that its popularity is much more closely tied to questions of public health and social class in contexts of dynamic transnationalism than to cultural tradition, ethnic heritage and nationalism within a narrow framework of colonialism [ [11](#B11-ijerph-14-01525)]. 3. Results: Bapu Nature Cure Hospital and Yogashram [37](#B37-ijerph-14-01525)]. Overall this provides critical insight on health management strategies that have a bearing on important cultural, economic and medical considerations [ [47](#B47-ijerph-14-01525)]. [48](#B48-ijerph-14-01525)]. As described below, BNCHY patients, many of whom are Central Government employees, or employees in one of over thirty government corporations and companies such as Housing and Urban Development, Power Finance and the Food Corporation of India, are treated for specific medical conditions. [49](#B49-ijerph-14-01525), [50](#B50-ijerph-14-01525), [51](#B51-ijerph-14-01525), [52](#B52-ijerph-14-01525), [53](#B53-ijerph-14-01525)]. Heart disease and diabetes, among most other NCDs, are progressive, multi-dimensional conditions that become more serious and more expensive to treat over time. An important consideration, therefore, is the question of whether or not patients integrate life-style lessons from workshops into their everyday lives. Although no data on this key factor are available, it is useful to think of the risk factors and symptoms of NCDs\u2014both early and late stage\u2014as moving targets that can be managed effectively in relation to medical criteria that change significantly during the course of a person's life. If the trajectory of this change leads only toward more narrowly defined, invasive, and pharmaceutically structured interventions, a person is progressively \"reduced down\" to the constellation of diseases he or she is diagnosed with and the overwhelmingly negative picture of health that is associated with the implementation of this reductionist logic. 4.
