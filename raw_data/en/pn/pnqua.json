Vibrating5wire sensors are durable, stable, and accurate when making various measurements over extended periods of time. They have been used to measure strain, pressure, tilt, displacement, and load, and are found in structural, hydrological, and geotechnical applications. Traditional time5domain methods that read vibrating wire sensors suffer from susceptibility to external noise, sometimes rendering measurements unusable. This paper describes a new method using spectral analysis for vibrating5wire sensors, resulting in improved noise immunity. In a representative noise test, spectral analysis produced frequency errors of less than \u00b10.02 percent of reading compared to errors exceeding 100 percent of reading using traditional methods. The new spectral analysis also improves measurement precision in the absence of external noise, achieving a precision of 0.001 Hz rms. Keywords: vibrating wire, spectral analysis, noise immunity, time domain Introduction Structural and geotechnical engineers often use vibrating5wire sensors to measure strain, pressure, tilt, displacement, and load. These sensors have a reputation for being accurate, stable, and durable\u2014making them well5suited for long5term static monitoring. Despite their acceptance, vibrating5wire sensors are sometimes plagued by a susceptibility to external electromagnetic noise. This weakness can produce unusable data, requiring data analysts to devote considerable effort to qualifying their data. This susceptibility to external noise is especially difficult in real5time alarm systems where post5collection analysis is not possible. This paper discusses a new frequency5domain approach that uses spectral analysis to read vibrating5 wire sensors, which improves noise immunity when compared to traditional time5domain methods. Fig. 1 shows this improved noise immunity when a drill motor was turned on near a vibrating5wire strain gage. Although the actual strain changed by only a few tenths of a \u00b5strain during the test, the time5domain analysis gave errors of 12,000 \u00b5strain. As shown by Fig. 2, the spectral analysis gave errors of typically less than \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5strain during the same noise event. 1 Industrial Group Manager, Campbell Scientific, Inc., 815 W 1800 N, Logan UT, 84321 Email: kstevens@campbellsci.com 2 Vice President of Research, Campbell Scientific, Inc., 815 W 1800 N, Logan UT, 84321 Email: ljacobsen@campbellsci.com 3 Principal and Group Manager, CTL Group, 5400 Old Orchard Road, Skokie, IL.

Comparison of noise immunity of time5domain analysis with spectral analysis during a noise event Fig. 2. Zoomed y5axis with the data in Fig. 1 6This paper describes the old and new processing methods and describes two monitoring applications that use the new spectral analysis approach to reading vibrating5wire sensors. Vibrating-Wire Measurement Principle A vibrating5wire sensor couples an external physical parameter, for example strain or displacement, to the tension of a taut wire within the gage. Because the tension in the wire is related to the wire's fundamental resonant frequency (see Equation 1), measuring the resonant frequency of the wire measures the external physical parameter. f = k \u00bd (1) where f = fundamental resonant frequency k = combined wire constants = wire tension (force/area) The taut wire in a vibrating5wire sensor is similar to a guitar string. By increasing the tension in the wire (or guitar string), the wire's resonant frequency increases. While energy is coupled to a guitar string by plucking it, energy is coupled to the wire in a vibrating5 wire sensor with a frequency5swept magnetic field that is included in the sensor (see Fig. 3). Once the wire is vibrating, data5acquisition equipment determines the resonant frequency of the wire and converts this resonant frequency into the desired engineering units. The following section describes the traditional time5 domain approach used to determine the wire's resonant frequency. Reading Vibrating-Wire Sensors: Time- Domain Analysis The traditional method for reading vibrating5wire sensors analyzes the response from a sensor as a function of time using period averaging. This technique excites the wire and measures the average time between a predetermined number of positive5slope zero crossings in the wire's response to give the wire's resonant period. Fig. 4 demonstrates this process. The resonant frequency is the reciprocal of resonant period. In a low5noise environment, this is an effective method of determining the resonant frequency of the wire. It has been successfully integrated into many data acquisition products that simplify its application with dedicated hardware modules, programming instructions, and software. This approach struggles, however, in noisy environments, as shown by the erroneous readings in Fig. 1. Fig. 5 shows the problem of measuring zero crossings in the presence of external noise. The external noise disrupts the signal, erroneously removing zero crossings. In general, external noise may introduce errors by adding zero crossings to, or by removing zero crossings from, the uncorrupted signal. Fig. 3. Vibrating5wire measurement principles Fig. 4. Vibrating5wire time5domain response function 7Even with this difficulty, engineers are sometimes able to gather useful data in noisy environments. However, this requires extra effort to eliminate noise sources or schedule measurements around periods of increased noise. An alternative approach requires data analysts to identify and discard bad data by comparing measurement data before and after noise events. Given these challenges, instrumentation engineers set out to find a method to determine the resonant frequency of vibrating5wire sensors with improved noise immunity. The following section describes this method. Reading Vibrating-Wire Sensors: Spectral Analysis The spectral5analysis approach analyzes the response of the wire as a function of frequency. Because we are trying to determine the resonant frequency of a tensioned wire, then it makes sense to analyze the response of that wire as a function of frequency, rather than time. The approach applies a Fourier transform to the sampled response to move it from the time5domain to the frequency domain (see Fig. 6). By identifying the frequency of the peak response from the resulting spectrum, we have identified the resonant frequency of the wire. With the data converted to the frequency domain, the sensor's resonant frequency can be determined even in the presence of external noise. As shown in Fig. 7, spectral analysis allows us to distinguish the sensor's response from the noise. Spectral analysis also provides improved measurement precision in the absence of external noise (Fig. 8). Vibrating5wire sensor manufacturers typically want to resolve changes in resonant frequency to 0.1 Hz. Time5domain analysis, in the absence of noise, can achieve measurement precision of 0.01 Hz rms. Spectral5analysis achieves measurement precision of 0.001 Hz rms, a significant improvement. Transforming the sensor's response from the time domain into the frequency domain provides additional advantages\u2014specifically, diagnostics that are not available with the time5domain approach. These include (see Fig. 9) signal amplitude, signal5to5noise ratio, and competing noise frequencies. These diagnostics are useful for a variety of purposes including validating measurements, understanding and identifying noise sources, and determining long5term sensor health. In summary, the spectral5analysis approach provides noise immunity, improved measurement resolution, and useful diagnostics for reading vibrating5wire sensors\u2014all significant improvements to those who rely on vibrating5wire sensors. 8Implementation of the Spectral Analysis Technique The usefulness of spectral analysis to read vibrating5 wire sensors depends on its suitability for field use. The device must be cost effective, rugged, low power, and easily integrated with existing data5acquisition equipment. Campbell Scientific, a data5acquisition company based in Logan, Utah, previously developed time5 domain methods to read vibrating5wire sensors. Armed with this experience, instrumentation engineers at Campbell Scientific developed a new vibrating5wire readout module that incorporates spectral analysis (patent pending). This new module, the model AVW200, excites the sensor's wire, samples the response, applies the Fourier transform, and returns the measurement result and diagnostics to the datalogger\u2014all within two seconds. The AVW200 and its wireless counterpart, the AVW206, have been available since early in 2008. Since then, they have been successfully used in a number of applications. The following sections describe how the new technology benefited two large bridge projects: the widening of the Huey P. Long Bridge in Louisiana, and the reconstruction of the I535 St. Anthony Falls Bridge in Minnesota. Case Study 1: Huey P. Long Bridge Widening Project The four main spans of the Huey P. Long Bridge extend nearly 2400 feet over the Mississippi River in New Orleans, Louisiana. (Fig. 10) This cantilevered steel through5truss bridge opened to traffic in 1935 and is owned and operated by the New Orleans Public Belt Railroad. The bridge currently carries dual rail lines between the trusses and two lanes of vehicular traffic cantilevered to the exterior of each truss. Based on the need to improve vehicular traffic flow and constraints due to uninterruptible rail traffic, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LA DOTD) decided to widen the bridge rather than replace it. The bridge widening will facilitate an increase in roadway width on each side of the bridge from its current width of 18 feet to 40 feet. The widening will entail the addition of upstream and downstream trusses parallel to the existing truss. The bridge piers are being modified with additional concrete encasements and steel frame to support the two new widening trusses (Fig. 11). A structural health5monitoring program is included in the construction contract as a proactive measure to assess whether the anticipated amount of load is being transferred from the widening truss members to the existing truss members. Fig. 10. Huey P. Long Bridge Figure 11. Rendering of planned renovation 9CTLGroup was awarded the contract to design and install the truss monitoring system according to the specifications for the Huey P. Long Bridge widening project. The truss monitoring specification required the following: Determination of initial dead5load stresses in existing eyebar members Installation of strain gages for measurement of construction5related stresses in 433 members Installation of strain gages for measurement of live5load stresses in 31 members Installation of biaxial tilt meters on each of the five existing bridge piers Monitoring system to read the gages, make comparisons with predicted values, and provide daily reports throughout the three5year construction process Performing load testing to calibrate the monitoring systems A total of 433 existing truss members are monitored with an array of 827 static and dynamic strain gages designed to measure axial and bending load effects. In addition, tilt meters monitor the inclination of the piers. For the static system, CTLGroup chose vibrating5wire strain gages based on cost, built5in temperature compensation, and the ability to run long distances with lead wires. The truss5monitoring data5acquisition system is composed of two separate monitoring systems: a static5load monitoring system and a live5load monitoring system (Fig. 12). The static system uses 23 track5side5mounted Nema enclosures that contain AM16/32 multiplexers to read 777 vibrating5wire sensors on 433 members. In addition, five piers were monitored using ten vibrating5wire tilt meters as well as ambient temperature, wind speed, and wind direction. Because of the need for wireless communication between multiplexers, dataloggers, and central computer, the system was configured using a combination of 24 AVW206 modules and RF401 spread spectrum radios. The multiplexers read the sensors, perform the signal processing, and transmit the data wirelessly to one of four CR1000 data loggers mounted on the track5side hand rail. These dataloggers then transmit the data wirelessly to the MTI office trailer approximately one5fourth mile from the bridge site. The purpose of the system is to measure stresses (strains) in identified members and compare with predicted response during the bridge5widening construction process. This is accomplished by: Establishing limits for predicted response for staged construction Accounting for baseline fluctuations (traffic/locomotive loads and temperature effects) Comparing measured with predicted response Automated flagging of limits outside of predicted response The system runs continuously and collects data approximately once every ten minutes. It posts the data to a password5protected website. The website visually flags (by color) data that are outside predetermined limits. With hundreds of vibrating5wire sensors involved, this monitoring project provided an appropriate setting to apply the new spectral5analysis method. The outcome was very positive. Historically, an application with so many vibrating5wire measurements would require extra effort to validate measurements and identify noise5 compromised data. Typically, some data would be lost due to noise interference. In this case, however, spectral analysis eliminated noise issues. No data were lost, and no extra effort was needed to identify noise5 compromised data. The diagnostics provided by the new method also proved to be beneficial, and they were used extensively throughout the project. CTLGroup reported that it could not have completed the monitoring project without the AVW206. Though they have previously used time5domain solutions, this experience has put them solidly behind the spectral analysis method. Fig. 12. Placement of gages 10Case Study 2: St. Anthony Falls Bridge Foundation Monitoring On August 1, 2007, the I35W St. Anthony Falls Bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis, Minnesota, collapsed in the middle of rush hour. The collapse killed 13 people and opened the eyes of policymakers and engineers alike to the serious nature of America's failing infrastructure. A tremendously cooperative effort to quickly and safely replace the bridge resulted. It harnessed today's technologies and continues to provide insight into bridge performance and long5term health. To that end, a program was instituted to show how internal instrumentation could be used to increase quality assurance, monitor construction loads, and subsequently show traffic5 and wind5load effects on the long5term pier performance. This was the first part of a larger program involving the entire bridge, and pertained only to one of the three elevated piers, specifically the Southbound Pier 2 columns and foundations. Therein, two types of strain gages and thermometers were installed to monitor three phases of the bridge and foundation system: (1) internal concrete curing temperature of the foundation elements, (2) construction loads, and (3) long5term health. Four levels of six strain gages each were installed in two of the eight 1005ft5deep drilled shaft foundation elements (48 gages total). Gage levels were designated to identify load5carrying contributions from various soil layers. These levels were at the top of shaft (ground surface), top of soft rock, top of competent rock, and bottom of shaft. Each gage level consisted of four vibrating5wire strain gages positioned at quarter points around the circumference of the shaft cross section. Two of the four vibrating5wire gages at each level were coupled with a resistive strain gage situated at opposite sides of the shaft. This scheme provided long5term stability with the slower vibrating5wire gages along with fast measurements from the resistive gages during dynamic events. In addition to the foundation measurements, two levels of four vibrating5wire strain gages were installed in I-35 St. Anthony Falls Bridge Shaft 1 Thermal Data 5256606468727680848892 1/8/08 12:00 AM 1/12/08 12:00 AM 1/16/08 12:00 AM 1/20/08 12:00 AM 1/24/08 12:00 AM 1/28/08 12:00 AM 2/1/08 12:00 AM 2/5/08 12:00 AM 2/9/08 12:00 AM 2/13/08 12:00 AM 2/17/08 12:00 AM 2/21/08 12:00 AM 2/25/08 12:00 AM 2/29/08 4 Footing and Construction Thermocouple Wires Disconnected Strain Gage Thermistors ConnectedFooting Concrete Placement*Thermal readings averaged per gage level (2 thermocouples & 4 thermistors per level). 11the two columns supporting the two southbound concrete box girders (16 total vibrating5wire gages). The first level was at the mid5height of the columns; the second was at the base of the column. Mid5level gages were duplicated with resistive strain gages for measuring short5duration transient events. Two separate data acquisition systems were used to measure the vibrating5wire and resistive strain gages. The vibrating5wire gages were read with the AVW200 and recorded with a CR1000 datalogger, including the vibrating5wire internal thermistor recordings. The measured with Campbell Scientific's CR9000 high5speed data5acquisition system. Vibrating5wire gages were sampled every two minutes, and the sample period was later slowed to a 155minute interval. Resistive gages were sampled at 100 Hz and the average, maximum, and minimum values were recorded every 15 minutes. Both systems were self5powered with solar panels and deep5cycle batteries, and each system uploaded data to a remote host server using cellular modems. This arrangement allowed the data acquisition systems to operate independently of on5site construction power and communications, and they did not interfere with day5to5day construction activities. Key aspects to both data acquisition systems were remote data monitoring, remote program downloading, and remote reconfiguration as the data acquisition requirements increased and decreased. Phase 1 involved internal concrete temperature monitoring. The embedded thermistors internal to the vibrating5wire strain gages provided one means of assuring that concrete temperatures stayed within acceptable ranges. Fig. 13 shows the internal shaft temperature at each of the gage levels over the course of shaft and footing construction. Phase 2 monitored increasing loads and how those loads were distributed down the length of the shafts as construction progressed. Fig. 14 shows the load on one of the shafts beneath the Pier 2 footing, along with construction milestones. This figure shows that almost 800 kips of the 35005kip total shaft load was resisted in end bearing, and that about half the remaining load was carried by the rock layers side shear. Load steps are evident between May 29 and July 9, showing the placement of each of the 15 box5girder segments. Phase 3 is ongoing. It uses the calibrations and correlations derived during Phase 2 to monitor the long5term health of the bridge.

Not only did this project involve a large number of vibrating5wire sensors, but the setup was located 5 ft from a 10005KW generator. As before, the outcome was very positive. Even with the large generator nearby, no data were lost due to noise, and no extra analyses were needed to determine if measurements had been compromised by noise. In fact, the raw data were posted automatically to a publicly5 available website every 15 minutes, without review or qualification. Because of the success of the new method in this project, the program manager already has plans to make it a part of two future bridge5monitoring projects. Conclusion This paper introduced spectral analysis as an improvement over the traditional time5domain approach to read vibrating5wire sensors. Spectral analysis improves immunity to external noise, provides better precision, and gives useful measurement diagnostics. These benefits have been validated in the field with the AVW200 vibrating wire spectrum analyzer. The new approach has been successfully applied in large and small monitoring projects, and it was key to the success of the two bridge projects described above\u2014eliminating noise as a factor in vibrating wire measurements. As a field5proven technology with clear theoretical support, spectral analysis is a major step forward in vibrating5wire measurement technology and should replace the traditional time5domain approach.

This highway connector meets I-35, from the north, just north of the Mississippi River at St. Anthony Falls and turns west after crossing the river with the new, eight lane, highway bridge. Its predecessor collapsed on August 1, 2007 at the peak of the afternoon rush hour traffic. This collapse killed 13 people and opened the eyes of policy makers and engineers alike to the serious nature of America's failing infrastructure. A tremendous cooperative effort ensued to quickly and safely replace the bridge. The urgency of this task opened minds and softened attitudes resulting in the harnessing of the latest technologies to build and monitor the long term performance of the structure. To that end, the goal of the Federal Highway Admi nistration, through their consultants (the University of South Florida, Tampa and Foundation & Geotechnical Engineering, Plant City) determined how internal instrumentat ion could be utilized to increase quality assurance, monitor construction loading, and subsequently show traffic and wind loading effects for the long-term pier performance. This was the first part of a larger program involving the entire bridge structure and included only the South Bound (SB) Pier 2 columns and foundations. Therein, two types of strain gages and thermocouples were installed to monitor three conditions of the bridge's foundation system: (1) the curing temperatures of the concrete foundation elements, (2) construction loading effects on these foundation elements, and (3) long-term monitoring of the structural elements as they continue to perform. For the sake of brevity I will only focus on the construction load monitoring, item (2) above. Many of the design assumptions used by the engineer are based on probability and historical, codified data (Design Codes). However, with the new sensor technology and remote accessing it will be possible to view in real-time the structural responses to a wide range of loading conditions. With this knowledge one can determine the efficiency of the design and may be able to foresee areas that may be working close to their ultimate capacity so remedial measures can be put in place before an ultimate condition is encountered. I-35W Bridge Replacemen t, With an Ounce of Prevention http://projects.dot.state.mn.us/35wbridge/ The traditional engineering design uses margins of error (safety factors) which will inflate the predicted loads, reduce the estimated capacity of the structure or include a combination of the two. The result is that the worst case scenarios, that control the design, may never occur and; hence, the structure's design is never fully verified and optimized. One way for the design engineer to confirm and safely optimize his design is to accurately determine the loading as it is applied and actually view the structures response to these loads. The FHWA goal was to establish a prototypical, monitoring system ( at Pier 2 South) for the expedited, I-35W br idge replacement program in order to develop a data-base that will more accurately describe the loading / structural response conditions during construction and for both short and long-term operational aspects for this type structure. The monitoring for the entire Bridge, including the prototypical work by USF/FGE at the SB, Pier 2, will be carried on by the Minnesota Department of Transportation in conjunction with the University of Minnesota. The structure is founded on steel H sections at the south abutment and on drilled shafts at Piers 2, 3, and 4. The superstructure is a combination of cast- in-place (cip), concrete box-girders built on false-work at the two side spans. The main spans are pre-cast, segmental, concrete box-girders built in free cantilever. The main span piers are posi tioned on footings that are supported on drilled shafts. Instrumentation for two of the eight drilled shafts at SB, Pier 2 included four levels of 6 strain gauges in these 100' deep shafts. Gauge levels were designated so as to identify lo ad carrying contributions of the various levels of rock formations along the shaf t lengths. Gauge levels were at the top of shaft (ground level), top of soft rock, top of competent rock and at the bottom of the shaft. Each gauge level consisted of 4 vibrating wire (VW) strain gauges positioned at quarter points around the circumference of the shaft cross section. Two of the four VW gauges at each level were coupled with resistance type strain gauges which were situated at opposite sides of the shaft. This scheme capitalized upon the long term stability associated with VW strain gauges and their capability to take instantaneous readings from dynamic loading events. The attached graph (below) clearly charts the evolution of the construction loads and their accumulation onto the drilled shafts. Correspondingly, we can see how resistance to these loads is dist ributed: Sh2 Lev 1(top of Drilled shaft) = 3200 kips; Sh2 Lev 2 = 1500 kips; Sh2 Lev 3 = 900 kips and Sh2 Lev 4 = 800 ki ps. 14Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 15Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 16Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 17Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 18Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 19Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 20Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 21Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 22Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 23Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 24Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 25Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 26Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 263-276. 27Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 277-288. 28Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 277-288. 29Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 277-288. 30Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 277-288. 31Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 277-288. 32Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 277-288. 33Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 277-288. 34Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 277-288. 35Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 277-288. 36Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Institute, ISBN: 978-0-9763229, 277-288. 37Deep Marine Foundations, A Perspective on the Design and Construction of Deep Marine Foundations Deep Foundations Mullins, M.ASCE2; Carl Ealy, M.ASCE3; and Danny Winters4 Abstract: The damping associated with dynamic or statnamic tests has typically been over simplied to provide a \"catch-all\" factor for those responses that could not be fully accounted for using present analyses. This factor has historically been considered constant for a given pile-soil system, but recent investigations as well as previous case studies show the plausibility of another explanation. This studyhypothesizes that damping is more closely associated with the increase in strain and not the total strain. Therein, the change in thevolumetric strain is being scrutinized to investigate its relationship to damping. To validate this assumption, a numerical model is createdwhich simulates the testing of a full-scale drilled shaft and results analyzed to determine the extent of the zone of influence and volumetriccontribution to damping.

Introduction In the area of quality assurance of foundations, numerous factors play into providing safe, reliable structures. These include, but arenot limited to, preconstruction soil investigations, structural ma-terial properties, construction methods, inspection methods, andpostconstruction verication load testing. In actuality the latter provides proof that all the rest were perhaps adequately ad-dressed. Rapid load testing /H20849such as statnamic/H20850 is one such method that assures a foundation can adequately support the an-ticipated design loads. Rapid load tests /H20849ASTM 2006/H20850 are categorized as being faster than static testing /H20849ASTM 1981/H20850 while being longer in duration than dynamic testing /H20849ASTM 2000/H20850. The signicance lies in the analysis of the foundation response to such a loading. The rapidnature of the test induces foundation acceleration, but the rela-tively long duration when compared to dynamic tests simpliesthe regression as no wave mechanics analyses are necessary. Todate, single degree of freedom systems have adequately modeledthe foundation response so as to ascertain a predicted ultimatestatic equivalent. Renements to these methods continue to evolve that further the understanding of all rapid loading eventsas well as similarly modeled dynamic events. One such rene-ment is presented herein. Background The impulsive nature of a statnamic test introduces rate-dependent components to the static response of a foundation. As-suming a single degree of freedom, lumped mass system, theequation of motion describing a statnamic event foundation and soil contributing to inertial effects; aandv=acceleration and velocity of the foundation, respectively; and c=damping coefcient. In almost all geotechnical applications, the damping force /H20849cv/H20850at- tributed by soil is regarded as viscous in nature. All values re-quired for solving the equivalent static response are eitherrecorded or can be easily found save two, the spring constant /H20849k/H20850 and the damping coefcient /H20849c/H20850. As the foundation response is nonlinear, the kxterm /H20849which is the equivalent static response/H20850 remains coupled as a single unknown. This leaves two unknownsand one equation. One of the most common methods to solve Eq. /H208491/H20850from statnamic test data is the Unloading Point Method, /H20851UPM, Mid- dendorp et al. 1992/H20852 or some variations such as the Modied Unloading Point, or Segmental Unloading Point /H20849Mullins et al. 2002/H20850. These methods make two critical assumptions regarding kx andc: the static capacity of the pile or pile segment is constant while plunging and the damping coefcient is constant through-out the test. With these two assumptions in place, it is possible todetermine the damping coefcient, and thus the equivalent staticresponse. Two points on the statnamic load-displacement curve are of particular interest when performing these procedures /H20849Fig. 1/H20850: the point of maximum statnamic force /H208491/H20850and the point of maximum1Postdoctoral Researcher, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineer- ing, Univ. of South Florida, 4202 E. 118, Tampa, FL 33620.

This rst point corresponds to a point of yield /H20849or postyield/H20850 on a theoretical static curve /H208491/H11032/H20850; the second corresponds to the point of maximum displacement /H208492/H11032/H20850and is referred to as the unloading point. At that instant, the static capacity can be determined using Fstatic=kx=Fstatnamic ma /H208492/H20850 The value of kxis determined and assumed constant from Points /H208491/H20850to/H208492/H20850. This enables the damping coefcient to be calculated within this range. Typically, either the average or median value ofcis taken, but reviewing the overall trend may lead to a more appropriate value /H20849Transportation Research Board 2003/H20850/H20849 Fig. 2/H20850. As the UPM determines the damping coefcient between Points /H208491/H20850and /H208492/H20850, it effectively determines the ultimate capacity. However, it has been shown that at smaller displacements, in themore elastically responding regions of the loading, that samedamping coefcient is not appropriate. Therein, the damping co-efcient may not actually be constant throughout the entire load-ing event when plastic deformation is achieved. This is likely tobe a by-product of the size of the zone of influence engaged bythe pile at a given degree of loading; this concept forms the basisof this paper.Case Studies Previous studies have shown that the statnamic damping coef-cient as dened by Eq. /H208491/H20850is not constant throughout the entire load test, but decreases from a higher, preyield value. These con-clusions were based on the rationale that the damping force, c v, accounts for all differences between the inertia-corrected stat-namic force and the observed static capacity as shown therearranged conguration of Eq. /H208491/H20850 c v=/H20849Fstatnamic ma/H20850Fstatic /H208493/H20850 Case 1: Shallow Foundations. The rst of these studies /H208491997/H20850 involved a series of static load tests /H20849SLT/H20850 and statnamic /H20849STN/H20850 tests conducted at the Turner-Fairbanks Highway Research Center/H20849TFHRC/H20850 in McClean, Va. /H20849Mullins et al. 2000/H20850. Therein, three side-by-side footings founded in sand were tested. The rst /H20849Test 1/H20850of the three was loaded statnamically with four incrementally increasing load cycles up to and beyond the bearing capacity /H20849two cycles under-yield and two beyond-yield/H20850. The second footing/H20849Test 2/H20850 was tested statically to a displacement that fully dened failure. The third /H20849Test 3/H20850 was loaded with a single statnamic load cycle that again reached bearing capacity. When comparing the true static capacity measured from Test 2 and the UPM-derived static capacity from Test 3, good agreementwas found for the ultimate capacity but a signicant variation wasnoted in the response prior to yield /H20849Fig. 3/H20850. The difference between the inertia-corrected load of Test 3 and the static capacity of Test 2 was then determined at each displace-ment and used to backcalculate the damping coefcient that sat-ised Eqs. /H208491/H20850and /H208493/H20850for the corresponding velocity. Fig. 4 shows the inertia-corrected statnamic load response and the truestatic as well as the damping coefcient backcalculated from thetwo tests. The reported results indicated that the damping coef-cient decreased in value by more than 50% after shear failureoccurred. Similarly, the UPM-derived damping coefcients for each of the four cycles of Test 1 /H20849denoted in Fig. 4 by Test 1-1, Test 1-2, Test 1-3, and Test 1-4/H20850 showed similar values for like displace- ments or degrees of loading when compared to the backcalcu-lated. The failure envelope dened by Test 1 was slightly higherthan the static envelope dened by Test 2. This deviation wasattributed to slight densication caused by the four progressiveload cycles. Case 2: Pile Group Tests. A second case study showing dis- crepancies in the assumed constant damping coefcient was alsoconducted at the TFHRC but by Ealy and Justason in 1996 on a Fig. 1.

The group consisted of nine, 75 mm diameter, 3.6 m long piles arranged in a 3/H110033 conguration. Test procedures included: static quick test, constant rate of penetration, and statnamic. The purpose of thestudy was to show the similarities and/or differences in the load-settlement response when subjected to a range of loading rates. With regards to the effects of damping coefcient selection, coefcients ranging from zero to twice the UPM-derived valuewere input to illustrate the variations in the derived static capac-ity. In general, very little difference could be noted in the elasticregions of the curves with more pronounced variations at pos-tyield displacements /H20849Fig. 5/H20850. These ndings highlighted the sen- sitivity of the derived static response to selection of a dampingcoefcient when compared to an inertia-corrected statnamic re-sponse where no damping is subtracted /H20849curve corresponding to c=0/H20850. When compared to the ndings of the static test, a damping coefcient value of approximately 30 kN s /m was found to match most closely /H20849Fig. 6/H20850. The authors concluded that even though the UPM-derived static response was reasonable when compared tothe static, the overall shape of the curves did not follow the staticor the CRP test results exactly. They continued by stating thatperhaps a more sophisticated damping coefcient may be appro-priate to more closely match the true static response. Fig. 6 showssimilar results to that observed in Case 1 whereby the authorsperformed the same type of backcalculation to develop a trend ofactual damping versus displacement.Case 3. Small scale drilled shafts. This study involved the static and statnamic testing of 3 m long, 11.4 cm diameter shaftscast in the TFHRC test pits in 2004. Therein, 8 shafts were con-structed using full length temporary casing and duplex drilling/H20849drilling and casing advancement together/H20850 through sand. The use of full length temporary casing ruled out variations in side shearfrom slurry properties and/or their effects. The water table wasmaintained below the tip of the shafts during installation and theconcrete was placed by free fall into the cased hole. A single12 mm reinforcing bar was centrally located, which was instru-mented with strain gauges for end-bearing delineation. All shaftswere tested statically and statnamically, but in various orders de-pending on location. Most shafts were tested with three cycles,either STN/SLT/STN or SLT/STN/SLT. This allowed subtlechanges in the strength envelope to be identied when trying tocompare two consecutive tests that should have been identical.However, in this loose sandy soil, all tests after the initial loadcycle appeared to fail at the same load and displacement with asimilar response. Fig. 7 shows the comparison of the static andstatnamic testing along with the UPM-derived and backcalculatedvalues for the damping coefcient. In all the cases cited, two apparent damping responses appear to have existed: a preyield or preshearing value and a lesser pos-tyield value linked by a rapid transitional period.

Numeri-cal modeling which is presented later was undertaken to shedsome insight. Full details regarding each case study can be foundin Mullins et al. /H208492000/H20850, Ealy and Justason /H208492000/H20850, and Mullins and Stokes /H208492007/H20850, respectively. As damping is caused by energy loss due to soil-particle in- teraction as well as the rate at which they interact, the size orvolume of the soil affected by the loading event should be directlyrelated to damping. The energy associated with damping is lostand not stored, therefore it is dependent on soil undergoing activestrain at a particular instant and not the cumulative amount ofstrain experienced throughout the entire loading event. It is hy-pothesized, herein, that the damping coefcient at a given dis-placement is closely related to the instantaneous volume changeof the soil surrounding the foundation. Up to the point of shearfailure around a pile, the radius of the affected soil and the strain-ing volume increases; upon shearing, the more distal soils nolonger continue to strain, and the radius of the zone and the vol-ume of actively straining soil decreases. The changing volume ofstrained soil signies a change in the energy absorbing potentialof the soil matrix /H20849the damping coefcient, c/H20850. Impulse Response A side issue relevant to the idea of a higher preyield value of thestatnamic damping coefcient, but nonrelated to the changingvolume of strained soil, is the investigation into the \"impulseresponse\" of a statnamic test. The term is used to describe thefoundation response due to the applied force over time, or im-pulse, and is not to be confused with the low-strain, nondestruc-tive test used in the evaluation of deep foundations. It isintroduced here only as additional support to the hypothesis anddoes not intend to offer an alternative analysis procedure but tomerely serve as an indicator of damping variability. The previousdiscussion denes damping as an energy-related phenomenon;however, an indication of the variability of damping becomesevident when considering the statnamic event in the time domain. Load tests are typically conceived in terms of work-energy principles /H20849i.e., load-displacement graphs/H20850. However, accelera- tions inherent to dynamic events allow for exploration using prin-ciples of impulse and momentum. If Eq. /H208491/H20850is rearranged and the integral taken with respect to time, the impulse imparted by theinertia-corrected statnamic force can be characterized /H20885/H20849Fstatnamic ma/H20850dt=/H20885/H20849kx/H20850dt+/H20885/H20849cv/H20850dt /H208494/H20850 As the applied statnamic force and foundation acceleration aremeasured and the system mass is assumed to remain constantthroughout the event, the inertia-corrected impulse on the left-hand side of Eq. /H208494/H20850can be easily calculated, at least in its discrete or measured form. Taking the derivative of Eq. /H208494/H20850with respect to top of shaft displacement lends insight into how the impulsechanges throughout the loading event d/dx /H20885/H20849Fstatnamic ma/H20850dtd/dx/H20885/H20849kx/H20850dt=d/dx/H20885/H20849cv/H20850dt /H208495/H20850 In to evaluate any fur- ther. As it is hypothesized that the term cis not constant andlikely a function of time or displacement, the damping force cv cannot be legitimately uncoupled. However, the discrete form ofthe equation at a given time step proves to be more manageable /H20849F Fstaticare all functions of time and m is assumed constant. In this form /H20851Eq. /H208497/H20850/H20852, it is apparent that the derivative of the inertia-corrected impulse /H20849hereafter referred to as the impulse re- sponse/H20850 is composed of two distinct terms, one of which is the damping coefcient. The other term, /H20849kx/H20850 /v, can be thought of as a \"mock\" impedance, similar to what is used in pile drivinganalysis. Though Eq. /H208497/H20850could have been quickly reached by rearranging Eq. /H208491/H20850and dividing by v, the relevance of the pro- cess comes from viewing the loading event in terms of an im-parted impulse or area under the load pulse curve. When plotted,the usefulness of this method becomes more transparent /H20849Fig. 8/H20850. Fig. 8 represents the impulse response of the third case study previously discussed as compared to the true and UPM calculateddamping coefcients. It offers an alternative to viewing the stat-namic event as a load-displacement curve and represents thegraphical interpretation of Eq. /H208497/H20850where the difference between the impulse response and damping curves is attributed to theequivalent static component, /H20849kx/H20850 / v, or impedance. Though the static component remains unknown, the predominant advantageof viewing the event in this manner is the ability to clearly indi-cate the transition between preyield and postyield conditionswithout knowledge of the actual static capacity. Noting the simi-larities between the impulse response and the true damping rein-forces the hypothesis of a higher preyield damping coefcient. Numerical Model In order to test the hypothesized damping variation, a numericallymodeled shaft was generated and subjected to different simulatedloading scenarios. The purpose of the modeling was to isolate thezone of influence around a loaded pile by determining both theradial extent and the degree of volumetric change experienced inthese zones. Therein closer soils would experience more strainand more distal soils less. The total cumulation of the volume Fig. 8.

Modeling of the zone of influence and thesoil parameters that affect this zone /H20849e.g., soil type, soil strength, and relative stiffness between the pile and the soil/H20850 were initially conducted under static conditions in order to shed light on thisphenomenon without compounding the complexity from inertialor damping forces. Parameters other than those directly related tothe surrounding soil matrix, such as pile diameter and length,were held constant to eliminate the vast complexity of the systemand focus on a general understanding of the system response.Though it is intuitive that the pile geometry largely influences thesize of the affected region of soil, it was the objective of themodeling to merely identify the aforementioned phenomenon andnot to stage the development of correlations. Once a clear under-standing of the soil/shaft interaction was obtained, complexitywas progressively added to the model. The computer program chosen to perform the numerical mod- eling was Fast Lagrangian Analysis Continuum /H20849FLAC/H20850. FLAC is a two-dimensional explicit nite-difference program that proves particularly useful in simulating the plastic flow of materials /H20849e.g., soil, rock, and concrete/H20850 upon yielding. The materials are repre- sented as elements that form an interlocking mesh. Once materialproperties are assigned to each element, various loading condi-tions can be applied to the matrix and the response of each ele-ment recorded /H20849Itasca Consulting Group, Inc. 2002/H20850. During the initial stages of development, several models were investigated in order to determine the most appropriate modelsize, model type, boundary conditions, and constitutive models.An axisymmetric mesh containing nearly 1,800 elements ulti-mately dened the 1 m diameter /H1100310 m long shaft and the zone of influence to a radial distance of 12D /H2084912/H11003shaft diameter/H20850 and depth below the toe of 1 2L/H208491 2/H11003shaft length/H20850. The axisymmetric model proved most appropriate for the modeling of a cylindricalshaft in a semi-innite medium. Such an extreme radial boundarywas chosen as to ensure total inclusion of the entire zone ofinfluence. Though negligible effects were noted at the boundary,the large model size was retained as a high-speed computer wasavailable to perform the nite-difference calculations effortlessly.Velocities in the horizontal direction were xed at the boundary/H2084912D /H20850, thereby impeding horizontal displacements, although the soil was allowed to undertake vertical displacements. This en-sured that the soil was in no way forced to a preconceived verticaldisplacement. The matrix was discretized into small regionswithin close proximity to the soil/shaft interface that increasedgeometrically in size with increasing radial distance. This rene-ment ensured the capture of crucial information near the shaft/soilinterface that would otherwise go undetected with large elements. Preliminary models were fraught with an overly elastic soil behavior when using a linear-elastic, perfectly plastic materialwith Mohr-Coloumb failure criteria. As more information wasrequired than a simple failure or no-failure scenario, it was nec-essary to implement a more sophisticated model that couldclosely represent the nonlinear behavior of soil. The soil /H20849SPT/H20850 correlations /H20849Gunaratne 2006/H20850. An interface was dened to delineate the side of the shaft from the adjacent soil. This interface was assigned stiffness values thatwould eventually allow slippage along the boundary. However,the interface was given properties synonymous with those as-signed to the soil. Therefore, the strength of the shear interfacewas the same as the strength of the surrounding soil /H20849soil/soilinterface instead of a concrete/soil interface/H20850. This assumption neglects reduced interface friction that can potentially happenduring wet construction of a drilled shaft when a slurry-cake linesthe insides of a borehole. The values assigned to the interface aremuch more representative of a drilled shaft with rough sides con-structed under dry conditions. It was also assumed that the intro-duction of the shaft did not signicantly alter the ground stressesfrom their initial state. Though all other parameters /H20849soil type, shaft length, shaft di- ameter/H20850 remained constant, successive models entertained SPT N values of 20, 30, and 40 /H20849Table 1/H20850. This allowed for insight into the effect of differing soil properties without individually varyingeach soil property. It was envisioned that this approach may provemore useful in identifying trends as there exists a high probabilitythat any future correlations developed from full-scale load testswould likely be based on SPT results. Also, varying the in situsoil conditions based on SPT Nvalues allowed for a more man- ageable testing matrix. Statically Loaded Model and Results Once the in situ soil conditions for the model were established, astatic load test was performed to a displacement in excess of0.05 m /H208495% of the shaft diameter/H20850 to ensure full mobilization. Load was applied to the top of the shaft in increasing 20 kNincrements with intermittent convergence criteria set to within1 N. Fig. 9 shows the load-displacement curves for the threedifferent SPT Nvalues. In order to ensure that the load- displacement responses are reasonable, an envelope showing theoutput from a drilled shaft design program /H20849Shaft 1-2-3/H20850/H20849 Mullins and Winters 2004/H20850 is plotted with and sufciently bounds the computer-generated data.Table 1.

It is apparent by ob- serving the ground surface displacement proles that the volume of strained soil increases radially from the shaft to a point ofmaximum volume prior to shear failure. Once shear failure isreached, only the soil immediately surrounding the shaft signi-cantly displaces, thereby decreasing the actively affected zone, orthe zone of influence. For the purposes of this paper, the maxi-mum signicant radial extent of the zone of influence is deter-mined by an arbitrarily chosen vertical displacement value of0.0001 m. Displacements less than this limit were consideredinsignicant. Interestingly, the change in the cumulative volume /H20849total vol- ume lost due to the straining soil mass /H20850throughout the static loading /H20849Fig. 11/H20850 mimics the trend in the load-displacement curve. Further, by taking the displacement-dependent derivativeof the cumulative volume /H20849derivative of cumulative volume with respect to top of shaft displacement/H20850, a trend appears whichclosely resembles the damping noted by the aforementioned casestudies /H20849Fig. 12/H20850. In agreement with the backcalculated damping coefcient from previous gures is the decreasing trend in dV /dx or/H9004V//H9004x, hereafter referred to as the displacement-dependent volume change /H20849DDVC/H20850. Near the beginning of the load test, there is a large change in volume. Shortly into the loading cycle,the DDVC rapidly decays through a transition until ultimatelydiminishing to a near constant value well into shear failure.Though the trends noted in the numerical model are useful in that the geometric shape of the curve provides insight into theoccurrence of signicantly sizable events /H20849point of failure denoted by sudden stability of the DDVC/H20850 throughout the loading, it is impractical, if not impossible, to capture soil displacement infor-mation at every location within the zone of influence /H20849especially at depth/H20850. If the numerical solution is to be useful, the model datamust be recorded in the same fashion as is plausible in the eld.For this reason, it is necessary to investigate alternative methodsof arriving at the displacement-dependent volumetric change. An alternative method for calculating the DDVC involves re- cording the ground surface prole /H20849Fig. 13/H20850 of the surrounding soil and determining the incremental loss of soil volume associ-ated with the depressed surface. With the aid of current data ac-quisition devices and displacement transducers, this methodbecomes an attractive option for verifying this soil behavior dur-ing shaft loading. Given an initial soil volume where the bound-aries are located a sufcient distance away from the shafts as notto experience any effects from the loading event /H20849Fig. 14/H20850,i ti s reasonable to conclude that the incremental loss of volume at theground surface is the change in volume experienced by the sys-tem. Indeed, a comparison of the DDVC calculated using bothmethods shows the similarities /H20849Fig. 15/H20850 and reinforces the valid- ity and practicality of using soil surface measurements to indicatetotal change in soil volume. This approach was then used for allsubsequent models with an understanding of the limitations of theDuncan-Chang model. Though the model is able to address thesmall strain nonlinearity necessary for determining the groundsurface prole, it does not address volumetric changes due todilation that may be present in stiffer soils.

Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://pubs.asce.org/copyright 72Dynamically Loaded Model and Results Once condence was obtained in the results of the statically loaded model, a more complex loading condition was applied tothe in situ conditions already established. Doing so provided ameans of comparing static and statnamic load test results on twoshafts of identical in situ conditions, a luxury not available duringfull-scale piles load tests. Dynamic effects were introduced intothe computations by applying a simulated statnamic load pulse,initially in the form of a sinusoidal function, then later as anactual statnamic load pulse recorded during a typical load test.This also required a modest modication to the model. In order tominimize wave reflections, it was necessary to remove the previ-ously xed boundary conditions and apply normal and shear quiet/H20849viscous/H20850 boundary conditions to both the extreme radial and bot- tom boundaries. Data from the numerical run were recorded and analyzed using the UPM /H20849Fig. 16/H20850. Similar to the previously mentioned research results, the UPM satisfactorily predicted the static capacity nearthe unloading point, but signicant variation existed throughoutmost of the test. The large zone bounded by the maximum statnamic force and maximum displacement afforded the opportunity to calculate theUPM damping coefcient over a large percentage of the test. Thisoccurrence, coupled with the backcalculated damping coefcient,allowed for a representative plot of the andpostyield statnamic damping coefcient /H20849Fig. 17/H20850. The overlap- region between the true damping and UPM damping curvesshows agreement between the calculations and ultimately offers areasonable plot of a variable damping coefcient. Equipped withthis plot, it was desirable to determine the cumulative volumechange and its relationship to damping. As it was predetermined from the static test results that an idealized zone of influence could be described from the groundsurface prole alone, only nodal locations along the ground sur-face of the model were monitored and analyzed to compute theDDVC. As before, the cumulative loss in volume resulting fromthe depressed ground surface prole was calculated. When takingthe change in the total volume with respect to top of shaft dis-placement, the trend displayed notable geometric similarities tothe plot of the damping coefcient /H20849Fig. 18/H20850. As with the results from the static model, the DDVC from the dynamic model is large prior to yielding but decreases with thedamping coefcient. Near the end of the test, both the DDVC andthe damping coefcient increase rapidly to a very large value.Similar calculations were conducted for the other specied soilconditions /H20849SPT Nvalues corresponding to 30 and 40/H20850. The same trends were noted in all three in situ conditions /H20849Fig. 19/H20850. When plotted with the DDVC from the accompanying static tests, itbecomes apparent that the loading rate has an effect on the mag-nitude of the DDVC. Although the magnitude of the volumechange between the static and dynamic models is quite different,it is reasonable when considering that inertial resistance intro-duced by the soil during dynamic loading decreases the magni-tude of the ground displacement. This rationale begs the validity Fig. 14. Method of calculating the change in volume using the ground surface prole Fig. 15. Comparison of DDVC calculation methods for a static load test /H20849N=20 /H20850 Fig. 16. UPM-derived static response for a statnamic load test /H20849N =20 /H20850 Fig. 17.

Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://pubs.asce.org/copyright 73of assuming a constant system mass throughout the test. Perhaps the system mass as well as the damping coefcient is variable. Also evident in Fig. 19 is the increase in the peak value of the statnamic DDVC with increasing SPT Nvalues. After shear fail- ure, denoted by the drastic change in the corresponding staticDDVC curve, the statnamic DDVC for all three tests seeminglyconverges asymptotically to a like value, similar to the true damp-ing as seen in Fig. 20. Considering the relationship noted betweenthe DDVC and the true and UPM damping coefcients, it is pre-sumable that the preyield value of the damping coefcient in-creases in a similar manner with increasing soil strength /H20849SPT N value/H20850. Conclusions The current, most widely accepted method for analyzing stat-namic data is the Unloading Point Method /H20849UPM/H20850, or some varia- tion thereof. There are two assumptions upon which the method isbased: the static capacity of the pile is constant while plungingand the damping coefcient is constant throughout the test. Thedamping coefcient is calculated over a region near the end of thetest; therefore, the calculated value of the damping coefcient isonly valid over this region. When a pile exhibits a purely elasticbehavior, the associated damping coefcient is valid over the en-tire test. However, when a pile surpasses elastic behavior andbegins yielding, the calculated damping coefcient is no longervalid within the elastic region but only within the yielding region.Since application of the UPM, previous case studies have notedthat the derived damping coefcient: Is valid over much of the load cycle for piles that exhibit purely elastic behavior; Provides a good estimate of the ultimate static capacity when yielding is observed; but Does not serve as a good estimate of the static capacity within the elastic region of piles which exhibit yielding. The intent of this study was to entertain the hypothesis that damping is more closely associated with the actively straining soilnot necessarily constant for a given foundation/soil system.Though the numerical model was not created to predict specicnumerical values, the computer-generated data reinforce the re-sults of previous case studies by offering a plot of the statnamicdamping coefcient which was backcalculated from modeledstatic and statnamic tests on shafts of identical in situ conditions.The plot of this \"true\" statnamic damping coefcient shows val-ues that are initially higher prior to yielding which then asymp-totically degrade through a transitional stage, where they coincidewith the UPM-calculated damping coefcient. The similarity inshape of the UPM-calculated damping coefcient and thedisplacement-dependent volume change /H20849herein referred to as the DDVC/H20850 strongly suggest that such a relationship exists. This is further reinforced by the similarity in shape with the backcalcu-lated damping coefcient, at least at small strains /H20849prior to and just after yielding/H20850. Differences between the magnitude of the static and dynamic DDVC are suspected to be a result of inertial contributions fromthe soil mass. This brings to surface an important question as towhether the assumption of a constant system mass is just as in-valid as a constant statnamic damping coefcient. Perhaps thecatch-all statnamic damping coefcient is largely comprised ofvariations in the system mass. Though tempting, the writers strongly discourage the practice of developing empirical correlations from numerically modeledresults. Therefore, any future correlations will be reserved forfull-scale load tests. These tests could provide an arsenal of datawith which to establish a quantiable relationship between anexperimentally measured DDVC and the statnamic damping co-efcient. If estimations of the statnamic damping coefcient can Fig. 18. Relationship between the DDVC and the true and UPM damping coefcients /H20849N=20 /H20850 Fig. 19.

Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://pubs.asce.org/copyright 74eventually be established using DDVC measurements, then per- haps an analysis procedure can be adopted that will provide thereliability of the UPM at ultimate capacity as well as an accurateprediction of static capacity at small displacements. If it can bedetermined that the DDVC measured during a load test is propor-tional to damping, then one simple procedure could involve signalmatching the measured DDVC curve to the UPM-calculateddamping value. Once matched, this altered DDVC curve couldthen be applied as a template for the damping coefcient through-out the entire test. Alternatively, the ratio of the peak measuredDDVC /H20849at the brink of yielding/H20850 to the minimum measured DDVC value can be calculated and applied to the UPM-calculated damping value to obtain a peak damping coefcientprior to yield. The impulse response can aid in delineatingpreyield and postyield conditions, and an appropriate transitionapplied between the two damping values. As both procedures in-volve the measurement of DDVC during the load test, they wouldprove advantageous in that the measurements would encompassthe specic characteristics of the foundation, thereby includingeffects from size, length, soil type, etc. Researchers at the Univ. of South Florida are currently analyz- ing experimentally measured DDVC data taken from both model-scale and full-scale load tests where the backcalculated dampingcoefcient is available to verify the legitimacy of the aforemen-tioned procedures.

Mullins, and D. Winters Synopsis: This paper provides an overview of three different instrumentation schemes used to monitor long term performance of FRP repaired piles in tidal waters. These schemes were evaluated in four demonstration projects extending nearly five years. Two of these used linear polarization to estimate the corrosion rate while the third focused on the variation in the corrosion current. Problems associated with selection, installation and monitoring are described and representative results presented from all three systems. The results suggest data from linear polarization is more consistent. Findings indicate FRP wrapping lowers the prevailing corrosion rate. Keywords: al.

INTRODUCTION The high cost of repairing corrosion damage has led highway authorities to explore the possible use of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP). In the past decade, several demonstration projects were completed that largely focused on repairs to columns and bents damaged by salt water run-off 1. More recently, with the availability of resins that can cure in water, there has been increased interest in using FRP for repairing piles in tidal waters2-3. Unlike damage caused by salt-water run-off, corrosion damage in piles in tidal waters is limited to a region close to the water surface (\"the splash zone\") that is subjected to periodic wetting and drying due to tide change. In the fully submerged region, there is little corrosion because of the much lower solubility of oxygen in water. Moreover, marine growth on the pile surface (see Fig. 1) also slows down the corrosion rate 4. Independent laboratory studies have conclusively demonstrated that the corrosion rate is lowered when a corroded region is FRP wrapped 1. However, in all the tests, wrapping was carried out under optimal, dry conditions. Since conditions for wrapping partially submerged elements in field repairs are less controlled, laboratory outcomes may not necessarily apply. For this reason, it is crucially important to develop instrumentation and measurement techniques for monitoring the performance of the FRP wrapped piles in field applications. Typically, piles are instrumented when cathodically protected 5,6. The instrumentation is primarily intended to monitor the protective current that polarizes the steel (makes it more negative than its original potential). The measurement of this protective current and the shift in its potential in the depolarized state (when the current is temporarily stopped) are used to assess the effectiveness of the cathodic protection system. Such systems are not suitable for monitoring the performance of FRP wrapped piles where information on corrosion rates before and after wrapping is relevant. Not surprisingly, none of the earlier FRP repaired piles were instrumented2-3. This paper provides an overview of systems developed for monitoring the performance of FRP in corrosion repairs conducted over the past five years. Li near polarization and galvanic current m easurements techniques were used and three different instrumentation schemes evaluated. Corrosion measurements were taken regularly until the completion of the projects and sporadically subsequently. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE Piles driven in tidal waters are difficult to instrument for corrosion rate monitoring. This paper provides an overview of three different instrumentation schemes that were used in four field demonstration projects to repair piles. As such, it provides unique information that is of value to researchers and highway agencies alike. 77 Health Monitoring Systems and Sensors for Assessing Concrete 13\u0018 BACKGROUND Corrosion is an electrochemical process consisting of simultaneous oxidation / reduction reactions on the surface of the corroding steel. Oxidation is an anodic process in which electrons are released by the steel resulting in metal loss. Reduction is a cathodic process in which electrons are consumed. The anodic and cathodic sites in a corroding bar may be adjacent to each other to form a micro-cell or distant from each other (as in different layers of steel) to form a macro-cell. The passage of electrons along the metal from the anode to the cathode creates a circuit that is completed by ionic transport of current within the concrete through the pore solution. The corrosion rate is determined by the equilibrium of these opposing anodic and cathodic reactions. If the instantaneous corrosion rate can be measured, it can be used to calculate metal loss and estimate rema ining life of the structure using Faraday's law. Linear Polarization It would seem that measurement of the corrosion current would be a simple matter of attaching an ammeter to the corroding metal and taking a reading. Unfortunately, such a connection is equivalent to internal shorting because the electrical resistance of the reinforcement is negligible compared to that of the concrete 7. For this reason, the corrosion current cannot be measured by direct means and alternative indirect means must be used. Two indirect methods are widely used to estimate the corrosion current. These are known as linear polarization resistance (LPR) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Both are based on the original empirical observation made by Tafel in 1905 relating current density (corrosion current divided by the reacting surface area of the bar) to the \"over-potential\". The \"over-potential\" is the result of the application of an external current or potential that shifts the potential of the metal away from its equilibrium potential. In case of EIS, this shift is investigated over a wide frequency range typically from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz. In LPR, only a single frequency is used. EIS therefore takes a longer time. For this reason, LPR was used in the testing. In LPR, because the over-potential is restricted to be very close to the equilibrium potential, the slope E/I (E = shift in potential, I = resulting current) is linear and is defined as the polarization resistance, R p. The corrosion current, i corr, is inversely related to the polarization resistance through the Stern-Geary constant. Thus, the lower the polarization resistance, the greater the corrosion rate and vice versa. Several portable devices are available that can be used to make the LPR measurements. The demonstration projects reported in this paper use a PR-Monitor Model 4500 manufactured by Cortest International System, Inc. Galvanic current As stated earlier, corrosion involves ionic transport of current through the wet concrete that serves as the electrolyte. In galvanic current measurements, sensors made of the same or different steel are embedded at different depths in the concrete close to the reinforcement. The small galvanic or macro-cell currents set up by the corrosion process between these sensors are measured typically using a zero resistance ammeter through an external connection. The variation in the pre-wrap potential of the steel in piles supporting the Gandy Bridge is shown in Fig. 2 . As potentials are more negative at a greater depth, they serve as anodic sites. The less negative locations closer to the pile cap serve as cathodic sites. Thus, prior to wrap, electrons will travel upward along the rebar from the anodic to the cathodic sites. The corresponding ionic current through the wet concrete is in the opposite direction as shown in Fig. 3 . As the FRP wrap is a barrier, over time it may be expected to slow down access of oxygen and moisture. As a result, anodic sites become less anodic resulting in a reduction in the measured current and a possible reversal in its direction. Galvanic current data can therefore serve as a qualitative indicator of the effectiveness of the FRP in slowing down corrosion. An essential requirement is for the embedded probes to be parallel and close to the corroding steel for this technique to be effective. Since installation of the probe disturbs the electro-chemistry of the concrete that is replaced, meaningful results may not be immediately realizable. 78140 Suh et al. PROBLEM STATEMENT The issues relating to access, logistics, installation of probes and taking measurements are common to all field instrumentation efforts. More recently, consideration must also be given to counteract the potential for damage by vandalism particularly in urban areas. These issues are compounded when instrumenting piles in tidal waters because of the lack of ready access to support services. Environmental conditions can result in unpredictable consequences. Particular attention needs to be paid to ensure that electrical connections do not corrode and are protected against the elements. Safety is of paramount importance and must be factored in all operations. Meticulous planning and coordination is required to prepare for unexpected situations. Brief descriptions of some of the relevant parameters are presented below: Probe size All probes that can be used have to fit in the 75 mm (3 in) concrete cover in piles. Size is therefore a critical consideration. Moreover, the larger the probe, the greater the effort required for installation and the greater the disturbed concrete region. Patching material The ideal patching material should be electro-chemically compatible with the existing concrete, e.g. similar chloride content and oxygen diffusivity. As with any concrete repair material, it should be a low shrinkage, high tensile strength material with the same coefficient of thermal expansion to minimize cracking. Corrosion protection Special care must be taken to ensure that materials used are corrosion / weather resistant. Specifically, stainless steel rods must be used for making connections to the steel reinforcement. Special weather proof PVC boxes are required to house the connections. Junction boxes have to be made inaccessible or unobtrusive so as to avoid unwanted attention. Environmental Low tide, and low winds are ideal but may not always be possible. As the corrosion rate fluctuates with temperature, readings should be taken at similar times at the designated intervals. As this too may not always be possible, temperature records should also be kept. DESCRIPTION OF DEMONSTRATION STUDIES Four field demonstration studies were conducted at two contrasting sites. The first, Allen Creek Bridge, located in Clearwater Florida, exhibits shallow and relatively calm waters. The remaining three studies were carried out on piles supporting Gandy Boulevard bridges spanning Tampa Bay, Florida's largest estuary. These bridges - the Friendship Trails Bridge and the Gandy Bridge are adjacent to each other. Fig. 4 shows their relative location. In all the studies, selected piles were wrapped using fiber reinforced polymers. Details may be found elsewhere 8-11. Whereas the piles for both the Allen Creek and the Gandy Bridge were prestressed concrete, those supporting the Friendship Trails Bridge were made of reinforced concrete. However, the procedures for instrumenting and monitoring were virtually identical. STEEL CONNECTION Before any corrosion measurements can be made to assess the pre or post wrap state, an electrical connection has to be made to the reinforcing steel or the prestressing strands. This steel serves as th e 'working' electrode in the electro-chemical measurements. The steel connections were deliberately made very close to the pile cap to make them inaccessible. More importantly, in case of prestressed strands, stresses are lower because they are located well within the transfer length (50 x strand diameter). 79 Health Monitoring Systems and Sensors for Assessing Concrete 141 In the initial studies, connections were made to reinforcement on all four faces of the pile. This was found to be unnecessary and therefore in later studies only a single connection was made. The targeted reinforcement was at the center of the pile face that could be easily located without the need for a rebar locator (pachometer). To make the connection, a 50 mm (2 in) diameter, 75 mm (3 in) deep hole was drilled into the pile close to the underside of the pile cap and a 100 mm (3.9 in) long, 5 mm (0.2 in) diameter stainless rod connected to the prestressing strand by brazing. In case of reinforcement, a hole was drilled in the bar and tapped to allow a stainless threaded rod to be screwed to it. In the Allen Creek Bridge where the steel connection was left exposed, 316 grade stainless steel was selected because of its superior corrosion resistance compared to the less expensive 304 grade. Where the connection was protected, the less expensive stainless steel was used. The 75 mm (3 in) deep hole was filled with mortar leaving a 25 mm (1 in) section of the 100 mm (3.9 in) stainless rod protruding. Before any pre-wrap readings were taken all marine growth covering the pile surface below the high water line was scraped off and removed. Potential readings were taken by connecting a standard copper-copper sulfate half cell to the negative terminal of a high impedance voltmeter while attaching the positive terminal to the steel strand via the stainless steel rods protruding from each face. A special template with holes punched on a 15 cm grid was prepared to ensure readings were consistently taken at the same locations relative to the position of the steel connection. In other applications, the grid locations where readings were to be taken were marked off on the pile and readings taken accordingly. CHLORIDE ANALYSIS Several concrete cores were taken to determine the chloride variation in the cover. The total chloride was determined every 25 mm (1 in) down to the level of the steel using the Florida Method 12. Table 1 summarizes typical results obtained for four piles P1 to P4 in the Gandy Bridge. The chloride level varied between 2.6-24.2 kg/m3 (0.16-1.51 (0.04-0.07 lbs/ft3) chloride threshold13. Values were highest in the first 25 mm (1 in) of cover and were lowest for concrete closest to the steel as can be expected. The highest chloride content was 310 mm (12.2 in) above the high water level. PROBE DETAILS Three different types of probes were used to monitor corrosion performance - two for determining the corrosion rate using LPR and the other for measuring the galvanic current ( Table 2 ). Of these, one was a commercial probe, one an in-house probe and third developed by the Florida Department of Transportation. Photographs of these probes are shown in Fig. 5 . USF The USF sensor makes use of the fact that linear polarization is based on perturbation of the corrosion potential rather than its absolute value. Therefore, any corrosion resistant metal with a stable potential can be used for obtaining the polarization resistance. The USF sensor was developed 8 to address possible vandalism concerns for an exposed site on the busy US 19 highway where accessible junction boxes could attract unwelcome attention. The intent was to use a system that eliminated the need for wiring and junction boxes. This sensor consisted of a 1.07 m (3.5 ft) long, 5 mm (0.2 in) diameter Grade 316 stainless rod with a 90o hook at one end (Fig. 6). It was embedded in the middle of each of the four pile surfaces, 19 mm (0.75 in) from the concrete surface. The 90o hook protruded from the concrete surface at the top so that alligator clips could be used to make the necessary electrical connections. Measurements were initially made by successively treating each of the four stainless rods as the reference or counter electrode, i.e. four sets of readings were taken. An analysis of the results indicated that a single reading was adequate and this was subsequently adopted. 80142 Suh et al. FDOT The Florida Department of Transportation developed reinforcing steel sensors that were used to monitor the effectiveness of sprayed-zinc sacrificial anodes14. The sensors are #4 bars cut to 45 mm (1.8 in) length with an exposed surface area of 1300 mm2 (2 in2). One end of the sensor has a length of insulated copper wire that is connected to the reinforcement in the pile. The sensor is inserted lengthwise, i.e. parallel to the reinforcement and 25 mm (1 in) away from it in a 50 mm (2 in) diameter hole drilled into the concrete. The hole is filled with mortar consisting of approximately 50% fresh water and 50% bay water. Commercial A commercial sensor was used for the linear polarization measurement. It uses a modified graphite reference electrode and a titanium ribbon counter electrode which are encased in a mortar block. Its overall dimensions are 60 mm x 60 mm x 125 mm (2.4 in x 2.4 in x 4.7 in). The sensor has two cables for direct connection to the steel working electrode and to the PR monitor used for making the measurements. INSTALLATION The sensors were embedded inside the concrete cover, so the ease of installation depended on its size. The USF sensor was the simplest to install because of its small diameter and shallow embedment depth of 19 mm (0.75 in). More importantly, no external wiring was required. A concrete saw with a pre-set depth was used to create slotted openings on each of the four faces of the pile and the sensor installed ( Fig. 6 ). The relatively small size of the rebar sensor also made it relatively simple to install. However, because the embedment depth was greater (50 mm), it was necessary to use a 50 mm (2 in.) diameter core drill to create a 50 mm (2 in) deep hole perpendicular to the concrete surface in which the rebar probe was positioned parallel to the main steel 25 mm (1 in.) away. Additionally, shallow slots had to be cut to route the wiring to the junction box where it was permanently connected to the steel (Fig. 7). The commercial probe was the largest and therefore required the greatest effort for installation. To accommodate this large sensor, multiple side-by-side cored holes were needed. Additionally, as the leads were thicker, deeper slots had to be cut on the pile surface to route to the junction box. As mentioned earlier, the openings made to install the sensors have to be filled with mortar. Since the chloride content around the reinforcement affects the corrosion condition of the steel being monitored, changes in chloride level can affect its corrosion state. For this reason, the mortar was made to match the chloride content of the surrounding concrete in the USF and the FDOT probes by using appropriate quantity of salt water. This was approximately achieved by making the mortar using about 50% fresh water and 50% bay water. Junction Boxes Except for the USF sensor, junction boxes were required to protect the wiring from corrosion and also to allow data measurements to be performed easily. An electrical connection was first made to the reinforcing or prestressing steel used in the pile. The wires coming out from the rebar sensors were connected to a stainless steel rod inside the junction box. The two cables from the commercial probe were similarly brought into this box. All exposed wiring and cables were inserted in grooves cut on the surface and sealed with hydraulic cement and or epoxy ( Fig. 8 ). PROCEDURE FOR MEASUREMENT Before any measurements were made, the PR monitor was calibrated against a Gamry Corrosion Measurement System. Polarization resistance values obtained from the two systems were almost identical. Similar agreement was also obtained for solution resistance readings from the PR monitor and a Nilsson 400 soil resistance meter. Since the piles were located in tidal waters, it was necessary to use a boat for access. The PR Monitor was used to take the linear polarization measurements for both the commercial and the USF sensors. The latter required appropriate connections to the working, reference and counter electrodes using alligator clips. 81 Health Monitoring Systems and Sensors for Assessing Concrete 143 The PR monitor was set up so that the linear polarization test would be initiated when the potential drift between the working and reference electrode was within 2 mV. For both systems, results were obtained from five potential scans with a 3mV step size and a step duration of around 50 seconds. Stabilization took much longer for the USF probe since measurements were made for all the strands in the pile. This was compounded by the fact that the water level in Allen Creek rose rapidly as the tide came in because of its relatively narrow width. Thus, it was not possible to take readings for all six piles under the same low tide condition. The rebar sensors were used to measure the corrosion current. This requires a zero resistance ammeter. As mentioned earlier, the sensors were permanently connected to the pile reinforcing steel inside the junction box. Three sets of measurements were made; in each case the connection of the sensor to the pile reinforcing steel was temporarily disconnected. The first two sets of measurement were made to obtain a measure of the corrosion current in the pile. The current measurement required the ammeter to be connected between the reinforcing steel and each of the two rebar sensors. In the third set, the current flow between the two sensors was measured by connecting the ammeter between the two probes. The measurements were made by connecting the negative terminal of the ammeter to the lower probe and the positive terminal to the upper probe. For this set up, negative readings signify that the conventional current flows from the bottom to the top. The movement of electrons is in the opposite direction, i.e. from top to bottom signifying the lower probe is less anodic than the upper probe. RESULTS Representative results from the demonstration projects are summarized in Tables 3-6. The results from the linear polarization tests are given in Tables 3 and 4 while those for galvanic current measurements in Tables 5 and 6. Corrosion rates in Tables 3 and 4 are classified as 'very high' (VH), 'high' (H), 'intermediate' (I), 'moderate' (M) or 'low' (L) in accordance with the classification described in Re f. 7. The definition of this classification is provided as a footnote to these tables. Linear Polarization Resistance The results obtained using the commercial probe for the GFRP wrapped piles P1, P2, P3 and the (unwrapped) control P4 are listed in Table 3. For each wrapped pile, three sets of data corresponding to readings taken in November 2004, June 2005 and July 2007 are provided. For the control P4, three sets of data are also provided excepting that the last set is from August 2007. The corrosion current, I corr, was obtained from the measured linear polarization resistance R p taking the Stern-Geary constant for the actively corroding steel as 26 mV. The polarized area (6800 mm2) was assumed to be that for a single strand with the same length as the probe. The entire circumference was assumed to be polarized as shown in Fig. 9 . The corresponding corrosion rate ( m/yr) was calculated using Faraday's law given by Eq. 1 nFt WIMcorr (1) In Eq. 1, M is the mass loss of steel, W the atomic weight of steel (55.85g), I corr the current in amperes obtained from linear polarization, t the time in seconds, n the ionic ch arge (two for Fe Fe2+ + 2e-) and F is Faraday's constant (96,500A). Of the piles wrapped, pile P1 was the most severely corroded ( Fig. 10 ). The corrosion rate 31 cm below the high water line was 194 m/yr in November 2004 but reduced to 10.2 m/yr by July 2007 ( Table 3 ). Similar trends can also be discerned in piles P2 (from 84 to 34 m/yr) and P3 (from 103.8 to 47 m/yr). Unfortunately, the control (P4) was in much better shape originally (see Fig. 10) and was selected only because it was in the same bent. Its corrosion rate fluctuated between 49.6 and 38.5 m/yr at the same location over the same time frame. The intermediate reading for both the control and P3 was lower than the final reading. This could be because of the higher ambient temperature. 82144 Suh et al. The results from the USF probe for six piles including two controls and four FRP wrapped piles using both carbon and glass are summarized in Table 4 . Two of the piles were wrapped under ideal conditions using a cofferdam (C1 and D1). Four sets of readings corresponding to June 2003, June 2004, June 2005 and June 2007 are presented. Inspection of Table 4 shows that barring the initial readings for control B2, all rates are low (L). This was the first attempt by the research team to repair piles using FRP. Although the site was selected by FDOT, none of the wrapped piles including the controls had visible signs of corrosion. The corrosion rates were small to begin with and fluctuated only slightly over the four year period when measurements were made. Given the low corrosion rates, it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions. The corrosion rates for the coffer dam wrapped (C1, D1) and the water wrapped piles (F1, E2) have remained low throughout the four year monitoring period. The performance of the GFRP (E2) and the CFRP wrapped piles (C1, D1, F1) are comparable. Though the rates in the controls show reductions, this could be because of the rapid change in water level due to tide; this meant that not all readings were taken under the same low tide conditions. Galvanic Current Table 5 and 6 summarize the results of the galvanic probe measurements from the Friendship Trails and the Gandy Bridges. These show the current flow between probes placed at two levels identified here as 'top' and 'bottom' illustrated in Fig. 3 . The initial current flow measurements for the Friendship Trails Bridge in Table 5 (Aug 2003) in both controls (99-S, 99-N) and two of the wrapped piles (100-N, 101-N) were positive, i.e. bottom probe was anodic. For the other wrapped pile, 100-S, the reading was negative signifying that the top probe was anodic. Over the next four years, the trend in the wrapped piles was to reduce [100-S (-21 to 0.1 A), 101-N (17 to 0.9 A)] or remain about the same [100-N (12 to 13.3 A)]. A similar trend was also indicated for the controls, e.g. 99-S changed from 1 to 3.5 A while 99-N reversed from 4 to -11.4 A. No similar trends can be discerned in the results for piles P1 to P4 for the Gandy Bridge summarized in Table 6 . For the control P4, the current became negative and then assumed a positive value. For all three wrapped piles P1, P2 and P3, the readings reverted to their initial readings after three years. Overall, the data from the galvanic current measurement data is confusing. This may be because of the difficulty in accurately measuring very small currents. DISCUSSION The results obtained highlight some of the inconsistencies and difficulties associated with corrosion monitoring. Numerous factors affect corrosion that cannot be isolated. Field installation disturbs the electro-chemistry and this can affect measurements particularly for galvanic current measurement. Not surprisingly, results for the galvanic current measurements ( Table 5 and 6) were found to be inconclusive. Linear polarization yielded more consistent results but here again measurements were influenced by tide change. This particularly affected readings from the USF probe where reaching a steady state took as long as 30 minutes. Taking readings for six piles sometimes took 6 hours during which time the water level changed. Aside from tidal effects, uncertainty regarding the polarized area is well documented. In this study, the polarized area was calculated on the basis of the entire circumference as shown in Fig. 9 . This may be valid where the concrete is moist and its conductivity high. In dry concrete resistivity is high and therefore only a portion of the circumference facing the electrode is polarized 15. For this condition, the polarized area is about half the circumference and therefore the calculated corrosion current is doubled. Furthermore, if cracks and voids are present in the concrete, the polarizing current cannot be distributed. Therefore, readings will be erroneous. Moreover, rates are strongly affected by environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity. Collectively, these factors account for the large fluctuations observed. 83 Health Monitoring Systems and Sensors for Assessing Concrete 145 Results were also inconclusive because several instrumented piles had low corrosion rates at the onset of the project. This was the case for the piles supporting Allen Creek Bridge (Table 4). Given the uncertainty associated with corrosion data, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn for this case. The most severely corroding pile wrapped was pile P1 ( Fig. 10 ). For this pile, there was significant reduction in the corrosion rate following wrapping: it reduced from 194 to 10.2 Pm/yr over three years. This result is consistent with data obtained from laboratory testing which shows that FRP wrapping slows down but does not stop corrosion1. This trend is reflected to a lesser extent in piles P2 and P3 where the original corrosion rates were lower. It may be reasonable to conclude from this data that FRP wrapping slows down the corrosion rate in piles. CONCLUSIONS This paper provides an overview of techniques used to monitor the corrosion performance of wrapped piles. Based on the results presented the following conclusions may be drawn: 1. Data obtained using rebar sensors was inconclusive (Table 5 and 6). Difficulties in measuring small currents make them less useful for monitoring the performance of FRP wrapped piles. 2. Linear polarization results using the commercial probe were more consistent. Measurements over three years indicated a significant reduction in the corrosion rate in pile P1 ( Fig. 10 , Table 3) which was most heavily corroded prior to the wrap. Similar reductions were also observed in piles P2, P3. All these piles were wrapped using GFRP. 3. The USF probe ( Fig. 6 ) worked well. It needs to be evaluated at another site where the impact of tide change is not as drastic. Results would have been more conclusive using these probes had the prevailing corrosion rates in the piles been higher initially.

This paper describes a study that explored the adaptation of these techniques for improving the FRP-concrete bond in the repair of partially submerged piles. Prototype vacuum bagging and pressure bagging systems were developed and bond improvement assessed fromresults of pullout tests on full size piles repaired under simulated tide in the laboratory. Pressure bagging gave better bond and was foundto be simpler because it did not require an airtight seal. A eld demonstration project was conducted in which pressure bagging was usedin combination with two different GFRP systems to repair two corroding piles supporting the Friendship Trails Bridge across Tampa Bay.Inspection of the postcured wrap showed no evidence of air voids. The study demonstrates that techniques developed by the compositesindustry may be readily adapted to provide effective and inexpensive means for improving FRP-concrete bond.

Introduction Recent advances in resin technology have made it possible to use FRP for the corrosion repair of partially submerged piles /H20849Bazinet et al. 2003; Watson 2003; Mullins et al. 2005, 2006, 2007/H20850.I na l lthe applications, the FRP was directly applied over the the \"splash zone\" /H20849subjected to diurnal wet/dry cycles/H20850 without removal of the chloride-contaminated concrete. Several investigators, e.g., Sheikh et al. /H208491997/H20850, Bonacci /H208492000/H20850, Debaiky et /H208492003/H20850, and Suh et al. /H208492007/H20850 have independently demonstrated that while FRP cannot stop corrosion, it can signicantly reducethe corrosion rate. However, the extent of the reduction dependson the integrity of the FRP-concrete bond. Thus, Michigan State University researchers Baiyasi and Harichandran /H208492001/H20850 reported that metal loss was lower where FRP was bonded compared to itsunbonded counterpart. Similarly, a study sponsored by TexasDOT found that in locations where the FRP had debonded, therewas increased localized corrosion under simulated tidal cycles/H20849Berver et al. 2001/H20850. Thus, good FRP-concrete bond over the entire wrapped region is essential for successful performance. The authors recently conducted on-site pullout tests on FRPrepaired piles at both above and below high water locations /H20849Sen and Mullins 2007/H20850. Fig. 1 shows a plot of the residual bond stress obtained for two different systems, a prepreg and a wet layup.Inspection of Fig. 1 shows considerable variability in the bond. Itranges from 0.7 to 1 MPa in the dry region of the pile and from0.4 to 1.8 MPa in the critical wet/dry region. In another demon-stration project, the FRP was found to have completely debondedfrom the concrete /H20849Suh et al. 2005/H20850. Research suggests that if the on-site FRP bond were improved by making it less variable, ser-vice life of the FRP repair would be extended, making it morecost effective. Why Bond Is Variable FRP pile repair typically uses hand layup techniques to impreg-nate the bers. In this case, the weight of the wet FRP materialacting downwards has a tendency to make it slide down the pilesurface. Moreover, as the vertical surface is seldom absolutelytrue, the FRP is not necessarily in continuous contact with theconcrete over the entire length as the resin cures. To counteract these tendencies, a plastic sheet called shrink wrap is tightly wound around the wet FRP over its entire length.Unfortunately, because of buoyancy effects and difculty inwrapping tightly above shoulder height, the applied pressure isnot uniform. Uniform pressure is widely used to improve adhesion in bonded connections. For example, in segmental construction, aminimum compressive pressure of 276 kPa epoxied match-cast units /H20849AASHTO 1999/H20850. If uniform /H20849gage/H20850 pressure can be maintained on the FRP wrap while the resincured, the FRP concrete bond may be similarly expected toimprove. Techniques for Applying Uniform Pressure Uniform pressure, through vacuum or pressure bagging, has longbeen used by the aerospace and automotive industry for fabricat-1Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620. 2Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620. 3Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620. 4Karins Engineering Group Inc., St. Petersburg, FL 33713. 5Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620.

Vacuum bagging has occasionally been used in infrastructure applications, e.g., Stallings et al. /H208492000/H20850 and Nazier et al. /H208492005/H20850. However, no similar reference relating to the application of pressure bagging was found in the literature. Objectives The overall goal of the research project was to explore the feasi-bility of adapting vacuum bagging or pressure bagging for im-proving FRP-concrete bond in the eld repair of corroding pilesin tidal waters. In order to meet this objective, it was necessary to:1. Develop prototype vacuum bagging and pressure bagging techniques appropriate for FRP repair of partially submergedpiles. 2. Evaluate improvement in bond through pullout testing.3. Implement the system developed through a eld demonstration. Background Vacuum Bagging Vacuum bagging applies pressure by creating a vacuum /H20849limited to a maximum of 1 atm\u2014760 mm of Hg/H20850. The essential com- ponents of a vacuum bagging system are /H208491/H20850a vacuum bag; and /H208492/H20850a vacuum pump capable of creating a signicant vacuum. Stallings et al. /H208492000/H20850 used a vacuum pressure of 0.034 MPa during a 6 h curing period for repairing a bridge girder. Nazieret al. /H208492005/H20850 did not state the vacuum pressure used, but their pump had the facility to achieve 25 /H9262m of vacuum /H208491 atm =760,000 /H9262mH g /H20850. Since vacuum is only sustained with an airtight seal around the perimeter of the wrapped region, surface smoothness at the pe-rimeter is a critical consideration. Additionally, there needs to bea method for soaking up expelled resin and its subsequent re-moval after the FRP has cured, so that its external appearance isnot marred. Fig. 2 shows a schematic of the vacuum bagging system used in the study. In this gure, a porous, thin, nonstick lm is referredto as the \"release\" and a thicker layer of absorbent material,called a \"breather\".The release is a nonstick plastic stretch wrap material. The breather material was a thick burlap cloth that allows air to beextracted from inside the bag. The bag is sealed at its ends so thatthere are no leaks. Pressure Bagging Pressure bagging makes use of a pressure bladder that surrounds a pile /H20849or a column in above water applications/H20850 similar to a blood pressure cuff. In essence, it incorporates an air-tight bladder in-side an outer restraining structure that can be rigid or flexible.Flexible restraints are more suitable as they can be tted andadapted as necessary to accommodate different pile sizes. Fig. 3 shows a schematic of the pressure bag system devel- oped. It secures to itself using a set of 21 toggles. The air bladderis inside this bag and is connected to a source of compressed air.The material of the bladder needs to be able to withstand tensilestresses that develop as it is inflated. Fig. 4 shows the componentsof the prototype used in the laboratory testing. Experimental Program The intent of the laboratory testing was to develop and evaluate aprototype system that could be used in a eld demonstrationstudy. Since the literature was dismissive regarding the suitabilityof pressure bagging, e.g., Nazier et al. /H208492005/H20850, only vacuum bagging was considered initially. However, because of problemsencountered in establishing a vacuum, pressure bagging was in-cluded and the original test program modied. In the text, testsrelating to vacuum bagging are referred to as the \"rst series\"while those for pressure bagging as the \"second series\". Material Properties The FRP systems selected for the laboratory study were identical to that used in previous demonstration studies /H20849Mullins et al. 2005, 2006, 2007/H20850. These were a prepreg system developed byAir Logistics Corporation /H208492002/H20850 and a wet layup system devel- oped by Fyfe /H208492002/H20850. Since the goal of the study was to improve bond, only the lower cost berglass was tested. Prepreg System The prepreg system uses a unique water-activated urethane resinin conjunction with a custom woven fabric. Because it is wateractivated, the FRP material is preimpregnated with resin and sent Fig. 1. Residual bond stress from eld study Fig. 2.

The pouches are opened just prior to application to prevent premature curing frommoisture present in the atmosphere. The properties of the unidi-rectional bers as provided by the manufacturer are summarizedin Table Wet Layup System Fyfe's Tyfo /H20849San Diego, CA/H20850 SEH-51A was the wet layup system used. It is a custom weave, unidirectional glass fabric that isusually used with Tyfo-S epoxy. However, for underwater appli-cation, Tyfo SW-1 underwater epoxy is used instead. The FRPfabric must be impregnated on site just prior to use. Properties ofthe materials as provided by the manufacturer are summarized inTable 2. Specimen Details A total of eight, 1.52 m /H208495f t /H20850long/H110030.305 m /H2084912 in./H20850 wide square prestressed piles were used in the study. These were obtained by cutting two 6.1 m /H2084920 ft/H20850 length piles donated by a local precaster. The piles were prestressed by eight 12.7 mm/H208490.5 in./H20850 diam Grade 270 /H208491,861 MPa/H20850 strands. The average com- pressive strength was estimated to be 27.6 MPa /H208494,000 psi/H20850 using a Schmidt hammer.The eight specimens were originally labeled A1 to A4 or F1 to F4 depending on whether the prepreg or the wet layup systemswas used. However, because of changes made to incorporate pres-sure bagging, one of the originally designated wet layup speci-mens F4, was used with the prepreg system /H20849relabeled Thus, ve prepreg specimens /H20849A1-A5/H20850 and three wet layup specimens /H20849F1-F3/H20850 were tested. Underwater Setup Wrapping was conducted inside a 3.05 /H110031.83/H110031.22 m deep tank lled with fresh water to a depth of 0.914 m /H208493f t /H20850to simulate eld repair conditions /H20849Fig. 5/H20850. This ensured that exactly half the wrapped length /H208490.457 m /H20850was under water and half above. To encourage marine type growth on the pile surface, specimens were left in standing water for 3 months prior to wrapping. Surface Preparation The corners of the piles were rounded to a 12.7 mm /H208491/2 in./H20850 radius and all surface irregularities in the region to be wrapped were patched and lled with hydraulic cement. Water pressurewas used to clean the pile surface. In the rst test series, a20.7 MPa /H208493 ksi/H20850 water pressure was used /H20849vacuum bagging/H20850.A Fig. 3.

This is the pressure recommended by the ACI Guide for Underwater Re- pair /H20849ACI 546.2R-98/H20850/H20849 ACI 1998/H20850. Fig. 6 shows pressure washing of the test piles at 68.9 MPa /H2084910 ksi/H20850 . Test Program As mentioned earlier, four piles were originally designated for testing using vacuum bagging for each of the two FRP systems. Ineach set, there was one control, i.e., external pressure appliedusing a shrink wrap, and three other piles in which the pressurewas kept These pressures were selected because they could be readily provided by ordinary vacuum pumps. Vacuum bagging posed problems not only because of the dif- culty in maintaining an airtight seal along the perimeter of thewrap, but more importantly air could inltrate through cracks inthe concrete outside the wrapped region. For this reason, vacuumbagging was abandoned after initial tests and pressure baggingevaluated with the remaining specimens. In all, two piles, A3 andA4 /H20849both prepreg/H20850 were tested under vacuum pressure of kPa /H2084910 psi/H20850 . Three others, F1, and A5 /H20849prepreg originally labeled F4/H20850 were tested using pressure bagging. These were tested under three different A2 could not be tested because an experimental surfacecoating peeled off. Table 3 summarizes the revised test matrix. The FRP wrapped region extending 0.457 m /H2084918 in./H20850 above and 0.457 m /H2084918 in./H20850 below the water line is shown in Fig. 7. As stated earlier, the pressure provided by the hand-applied stretchlm /H20849deemed as zero applied pressure/H20850 was taken as the control. The prepreg piles were tested using both the vacuum bag andpressure bag systems, while the wet layup piles were only testedwith the pressure bag system. FRP Wrapping The wrapping scheme used by both systems consisted of three glass layers\u2014one unidirectional layer in the longitudinal directionand two unidirectional layers in the transverse direction. Theprepreg system had an additional veil layer. This was consistentwith layouts used in earlier demonstration studies. The longitudinal layer consisted of four 0.914 /H110030.305 m wide individual pieces. The dimensions of the transverse pieces dif-fered for the two systems: For the prepreg, it was a single0.203/H1100315.85 m long piece, whereas for the wet layup, it con- sisted of two 0.305 /H110031.27 m pieces. Vacuum BaggingIn the prepreg system, a base resin coating is applied to theconcrete surface prior to wrapping to improve the FRP-concretebond. The opportunity was taken to evaluate two different resins:/H208491/H20850Aquawrap Base Primer No. 4; and /H208492/H20850Bio-Dur 563, a heavy-duty epoxy. These were each applied to two of the four pilesurfaces. Test piles A1 and A4 were wrapped on the rst day with A1 as the control pile and A4 with vacuum pressure /H2084968.9 kPa/H20850 . Test pile A4 encountered problems with the sealing of the vacuumbag to the concrete surface above and below the FRP area.Extensive cracking above the FRP repair area allowed air tobreach the vacuum bag, not allowing formation of an airtight seal.The air leaks were contained by lling in the cracks with epoxy,and a vacuum seal was obtained 45 min after the FRP was applied/H20849Fig. 8/H20850. Test piles A2 and A3 were repaired next with the base resin applied to the entire pile beyond the repair areas so as to seal the Table 2.

The FRP material was immediately installed on pile A3 following the application of the base resin. Again, the vacuumbag had difculties sealing despite the coating of the uncuredresin on the pile. Once an airtight seal was obtained, a 68.9 kPa/H2084910 psi/H20850 vacuum pressure was readily achieved. The base resin applied to pile A2 was allowed to cure 24 h prior to the application of the FRP material. After 24 h, the resinprecoat was inspected and it was found that no signicant bondwas achieved below the water line between the resin base layerand the concrete substrate. As a result, no FRP was subsequentlyapplied to the pile.The researchers concluded that vacuum bagging was only effective for undamaged piles where an air-tight seal could beobtained. There was no similar need for air-tight seals if only anexternal pressure had to be maintained. As piles in need of repairwere likely to be cracked, vacuum bagging was likely to be prob-lematic in eld repairs. Pressure Bagging Unlike vacuum bagging where a vacuum pump was needed, pres-sure bagging only needed compressed air. However, a suitablepressure bag had to be designed and fabricated for the testing.Consideration had to be given to the material used for the bladderso that it could withstand tensile hoop stresses that developedfrom pressurization. The two components of the pressure bag are the inner bladder and the restraining bag /H20849Fig. 4/H20850. The inner bladder was con- structed of PVC shower liner material and the restraining bagmade out of nylon rip-stop material. The nylon rip-stop materialwas selected to withstand the tensile hoop stresses. Prepreg System. The pressure bag was designed to resist the maximum 68.9 kPa /H2084910 psi/H20850 pressure applied to the FRP re- pair area during curing. Pile A5 was repaired using the pressurebag system. Fig. 9 shows the inflated pressure bag around the testpile. No major difculties were encountered. However, gasbubbles generated during the curing phase of the urethane resinwere seen escaping from between the pile and bag below thewater line. Wet Layup System. The wet layup system was only tested using the pressure bag system on piles F1 and F2 with F3 servingas a control pile. The applied pressure /H208495 psi/H20850 and 14.5 kPa /H208492.1 psi/H20850 on test piles F1 and F2, respectively.Table 3.

Only the results of the destructive testing are reported here.Results of the nondestructive testing may be found elsewhere/H20849Mullins et al. 2007; Schrader 2007 /H20850. The bond between FRP and concrete was determined from pullout tests carried out in accordance with ASTM D 4541/H20849ASTM 2002/H20850 using an Elcometer diam aluminum dollies. A 0.1 /H110030.1 m grid was drawn on all four wrapped surfaces and destructive testsconducted at selected intersections in all the test specimens.A total of 151 pullout tests were conducted. Of these, 83 wereconducted above the water line and 68 below the water line.Fewer tests were conducted below the original water line becauseregions where the bond was poor were not smooth /H20849Schrader 2007/H20850. A summary of relevant results is shown in Fig. 10. The \"above water\" and \"below water\" results are shown separately. Thesecompare the average bond for both the prepreg and the wet layupsystems. Inspection of Fig. 10 shows that vacuum bagging /H20849used only with the prepreg system/H20850 did not lead to any improvement in bond. Pressure bagging, on the other hand, led to signicant im-provement in bond both above /H20849from 0.94 to 1.57 MPa/H20850 and below the water line /H20849from 0.26 to 1.17 MPa/H20850. In contrast, the results for the wet layup system were mixed. It reduced margin-ally from 2.01 to 1.95 MPa above water but increased from 1.65to 1.77 MPa below water. FRP pile repair is part bond critical, part contact critical since the wrap must withstand expansive forces due to corrosion. Forbond-critical applications, ACI 440 /H20849ACI 2002/H20850 guidelines specify 1.38 MPa /H20849200 psi/H20850 as a minimum pull-off strength if FRP is to be used. This limit was used as a lter to distinguish between satis-factory and unsatisfactory bond. Fig. 9. Pressure bag applied to prepreg system Fig. 10.

Inspection of this g- ure shows that pressure bagging beneted both the wet layup andthe prepreg systems. In case of wet layup, the increase in satis-factory bond ranged from around 83 to 89% above water andfrom around 63 to over 72% below water. For the prepreg system,the corresponding increase was from 19 to about 67% /H20849above water/H20850 and from 0.5 to over 30% below water. The percentage improvement was more noticeable for the prepreg system due tolow initial baseline values /H20849see Fig. 1/H20850. Field Study A demonstration project was conducted to implement the pressurebag system developed. The site for the repair was the Tampa sideof the Friendship Trails Bridge that is under the jurisdiction ofHillsborough County. The Friendship Trails Bridge no longer carries vehicular traf- c, but is now the world's longest over-the-water recreation trail.The 4.18 km /H208492.6 mile/H20850 bridge is supported on 254 piers and 22 columns numbered 1-276 extending east from St. Petersburg toTampa. Seventy-seven percent of the 254 piers have needed to berepaired, indicating that the environment is very aggressive. In a previous study /H20849Mullins et al. 2006/H20850, Piers 99-101 on the Tampa side of the Friendship Trails Bridge were considered to bethe most suitable because all the piles were in a similar state ofdisrepair. For this reason, two remaining unwrapped reinforcedconcrete piles in Pier 101 were selected for the eld demonstra-tion in this study. The 0.508 /H110030.508 m /H2084920/H1100320 in./H20850 piles were reinforced by eight No. 8 /H2084925.4 mm diam/H20850 bars. Details of the two piles selected are summarized in Table 4. The table also includes information on the two instrumented con-trols in pier 99 from the previous study. The relative positions ofthe test piles in the pier are shown in Fig. 12. Instrumentationconsisting of rebar probes developed by the Florida Departmentof Transportation was the same as used in the earlier study. Asbefore, they were installed at two different depths along a pile toallow measurement of the corrosion current between the probesafter the system had stabilized. Pressure Bag The prototype built for the laboratory testing was scaled up to match the dimensions of the larger eld piles. However, somechanges were made to the original design, namely /H208491/H20850a cinch strap was introduced to tie the bag at the top to prevent upwardmovement /H20849due to buoyancy effects/H20850 after the bladder had been inflated; /H208492/H20850the toggle connections of the two ends /H20849Fig. 4/H20850 were replaced by snap-on hooks. In addition, a burlap breather layerwas added to the prepreg system to allow gases generated duringcuring to exit. It was believed bond had been adversely affectedfor the prepreg system by the outward pressures exerted by es-caping gases that formed during curing. Surface Preparation Previous procedures were followed except for a change in thewater pressure used for the nal cleaning. A scraper was used toremove all marine growth from the region to be wrapped.

All four corners were chamfered and were ground to a 19 mm /H208493/4 in./H20850 radius using a grinder. Finally, all surfaces were ground and pressure washed using fresh water to remove all dust,debris, and remaining marine growth just prior to wrapping. Fig. 13 shows the test piles prior to FRP application. Pressure washing was attempted with the same 68.9 MPa /H2084910 ksi/H20850 unit used in the laboratory study. However, because of thelarge water supply demand and lack of ready availability of fresh-water at the site, the 20.7 MPa /H208493 ksi/H20850 pressure washer was used instead. Wrapping Prepreg The prepreg system was used to wrap the interior north pile inPier 101. It was wrapped using one unidirectional glass ber layerin both the longitudinal and transverse directions. Wrapping com-menced from the pile top 0.3048 m /H2084912 in./H20850 below the underside of the pile cap to accommodate the presence of the junction boxused for corrosion measurements. The procedure for applying theglass ber used earlier was followed /H20849Mullins et al. 2006/H20850. How- ever, a new device /H20849resembling a miniature bed of nails/H20850 was used to puncture the entire surface of the stretch wrap with tiny holesto allow curing gases to escape. A burlap breathing layer was now placed over the punctured stretch wrap. This ensured that gases generated during curingof the urethane resin could escape without compromisingbond. Next, the pressure bag was carefully positioned so that thetwo ends were joined over the middle of the pile. The cinchstraps were tightened at the top and bottom to prevent the bagfrom moving upwards once the bladder inside the bag had beeninflated. A constant pressure of 14.5 kPa /H208492.1 psi/H20850 was applied to the wrap during curing for a period of 3 h /H20849initial set/H20850. The pressure bag was then removed. The wrap was subsequently al-lowed to cure for one week. After removing the plastic stretchlm, the pile was painted with the same base primer for UVprotection. Wet Layup System The interior south pile in Pier 101 was wrapped using the wet layup system. The bers were impregnated with resin on site byhand using a roller to distribute the epoxy evenly over the fabric.The usual procedure for wrapping was followed /H20849Mullins et al.2006/H20850. Since no gases are given off during curing, the burlapbreathing layer was not required. The pressure bag was directlyplaced over the plastic stretch lm that covered the entirewrapped region. As before, the ends of the pressure bag werepositioned over the middle face of the pile and cinch straps at thetop and bottom tightened to prevent the bag from moving when itwas inflated. A constant pressure of 14.5 kPa /H208492.1 psi/H20850 was ap- plied to the wrap during curing for a period of 16 h. This wassignicantly longer than the time used for the prepreg systembecause the initial set time was longer. Fig. 14 shows the pressurebag applied to the wet layup pile. Fig. 15 shows the FRP repairedpiles with the UV protection applied. Discussion This study described the adaptation of techniques widely usedby the composite industry to improve FRP-concrete bond.Both vacuum bagging and pressure bagging were successfullyimplemented. The advantage of the vacuum bag system is that there are no strength requirements, since pressure is applied by evacuating air.However, it requires air tight seals around the perimeter that maybe difcult to achieve, especially if the pile is cracked. The pres-sure bag system does not require air tight seals, but the material ofthe air bladder must be strong enough to withstand tensile hoopstresses that develop. In the study, vacuum bagging was only tested for the pre- preg system where it was found to be ineffective, possibly be-cause of the short setting time of the urethane resin. Thetime taken to resolve leaks in the seal coupled with gases gener-ated during curing may have been responsible for this unantici-pated result. However, as the chemistry for epoxy resin isdifferent, it would be unwise to extrapolate the ndings for theurethane resin. Unfortunately, tight deadlines did not permit fur-ther investigation. Destructive pullout tests showed that pressure bagging led to improved bond. This is most probably because uniform pressureensured the FRP was in continuous contact with the concretesurface as it cured. This automatically enhanced the chemicaladhesion between concrete surface and FRP. Additionally, bondwas enhanced by forcing resin into the concrete pore structure. Fig. 14.

Piles after FRP repair with UV coating 342 / JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION \u00a9 ASCE / MAY/JUNE 2008 Downloaded 15 Jul 2009 to 131.247.9.208. Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://pubs.asce.org/copyright 104Pressure also made the FRP denser by squeezing out excess resin, thereby improving the mechanical and corrosion resistant proper-ties of the system. Conclusions This study was undertaken to improve the integrity of the FRP-concrete bonding that was achievable under water. Previous testshad found this to be variable /H20849Fig. 1/H20850. It was believed that if constant pressure were maintained as the resin cured, bond wouldbe improved because of increased frictional resistance. Two disparate approaches were tested in the laboratory\u2014 vacuum bagging and pressure bagging. Both systems were madeto work. However, inherent sealing problems associated withvacuum bagging made it a less attractive solution, particularly forrepairs of damaged piles. Pressure bagging had no similar re-quirement and was found to be more effective, particularly for thewet layup system. The pressure bagging system developed was implemented without incident in the repair of two piles on pier 101 of theFriendship Trails Bridge. Visual and tactile inspection indicatedthat the FRP-concrete bond obtained was better than in earlierprojects. The study is indicative of the relative ease with which tech- nologies developed by the composites industry can be used ininfrastructure applications. While the application focused on pilerepair, the systems developed are versatile and can also be usedfor repairs of columns and bents under dry conditions.

E-mail: mpando@ uprm.edu The authors have presented a very interesting paper on post- grouted drilled shafts /H20849PGDS/H20850, a deep foundation system that is relatively new to North American geotechnical practice. A clearstrength of the paper is the documentation of full-scale eld testdata for ve test sites, particularly given the scarcity of thesetypes of data on deep foundation systems. In the opinion of thediscussers, however, the paper does not provide important infor-mation regarding procedures and data reduction of the eld testsconducted. This lacking information is important so that readerscan have a complete story. However, the discussers believe thispaper is a very useful contribution toward establishing a reliable design rationale and methodology for PGDS in different types ofsoils. Review of the references cited in the paper shows that the case histories involved load tests carried out using the Statnamic de-vice, which typically involves test durations of less than a second.This is important information that should be mentioned explicitlyin the paper. Although Statnamic testing has been used for quitesome time and its usefulness is not questioned, it is important thatthis aspect be mentioned in the paper and any associated assump-tions involved in the eld data reduction should be stated anddiscussed. Furthermore, some important details on the full-scaleload tests were not found in the references cited for each casehistory, and it would be helpful to the geotechnical community'sunderstanding of the use of postgrouted drill shafts if some addi-tional information is provided by the authors. This is particularly important in North America, where this deep foundation system is relatively new. Specically, the follow-ing design issues should be specied for each case history pre-sented: /H208491/H20850whether grout pressure was locked in or not; /H208492/H20850how end bearing load versus tip displacement was measured or back-calculated during each Statnamic test; and /H208493/H20850whether the end bearing versus tip displacement results presented were correctedfor possible damping and load rate effects that can be associatedto the Statnamic testing procedure. In closing, the authors have provided a very valuable paper that illustrates the promise of this new deep foundation systemand improves our knowledge of the design issues involved withpostgrouted drilled shafts. As our knowledge and understandingof some of the pending technical and design issues related to theuse of postgrouted drilled shafts increase, we will likely nd thatthis foundation system becomes more mainstream in North America.

E-mail: sdapp@danbrownandassociates.com The authors appreciate the discussers' interest in this topic and the time taken to submit a discussion. Therein, the use of rapid loadtesting and the various analysis methods were of interest to thediscussers, along with the pressure state of grout while it cured.Although some of these points can be gleaned from the paper,procedures and \"how-to\" knowledge could not be adequately ad-dressed without detracting from the intended design emphasis. Rapid load tests were used on all shafts in the original studies whereby both inertia and damping corrections were applied,which became standard ca. 1995 /H20849Middendorp 1995/H20850. This in- cluded both the grouted and ungrouted shafts. Methods for estab-lishing the shear stress and displacement distribution throughoutthe shaft are commonly applied using the segmental unloading point method /H20849Lewis 1999; Mullins et al. 2002/H20850. Thereby, toe displacements are computed from the measured strain distributionand the top of shaft movement for each measured time interval. Inmost of the test shafts used in the presented study, toe accelerom-eters were also used to corroborate the computed values. No appreciable effect on load-carrying capacity has been noted by using either a \"locked-in\" or \"unlocked\" grout pressure state inshafts tipped in cohesionless soils. In brittle bearing strata, how-ever, that may not be the case. Locking in the applied grout pres-sure forces the side shear to react with a downward force tobalance the upward grout pressure. Upon subsequent structuralloading, all loads are transferred directly to the tip until sufcientdisplacement is experienced to reverse the side shear force direc-tion. If the end bearing strata cannot tolerate additional load orbrittle fracture occurs beneath the tip, all load will be quicklytransferred to the side shear whereby it will be forced to solelysupport the structural load. Under these conditions, relying onadditional strain tolerance could be catastrophic and may causethe two capacity components /H20849side shear and end bearing/H20850 to act JOURNAL OF GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING \u00a9 ASCE / MARCH 2008 / 413 Downloaded 15 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208.

We, the discussers, note that the authors' paper contains some interesting and contentious results. Most notable is the very largeacceleration of solute transport /H20849a/H1101195% reduction in break- through time/H20850 indicated in Case II, since this case approximates the situation encountered in many modern engineered geocom-posite contaminant barriers. Results from our own modeling/H20849based on a large deformation formulation/H20850 for a large variety of similar analyses encompassing small deformation situations/H20849less than /H1101115% settlement/H20850 have indicated that although an ac- celeration of transport does arise from barrier consolidation,breakthrough time reductions are typically less than 30%. To un-derstand the reason for the discrepancy in these ndings, we havecarefully scrutinized the authors' paper and have found what ap-pear to be signicant errors in the analysis. Results of calculations presented in Table 1 are based on the parameter values employed in the Case II analysis. These indicatethat the settlements of soil layers of porosity in the range 0.25 to0.75 will be very small /H20849less than /H110115%/H20850. This reinforces the suit- ability of the assumption of small deformations implicit in themodel formulation, but it also suggests that the reported very large reduction in breakthrough time is implausible. This moti-vated us to reanalyze the problem based on the governing equa-tions and boundary/initial conditions provided and attempt toreproduce the breakthrough curve results presented for Case II/H20849B=5/H20850. The breakthrough curves obtained from our reanalysis are pre- sented in Fig. 1 and appear to indicate the nature of the error inthe original analysis. It may be seen that the quoted parametervalue of P c=0.0143 corresponds to a negligible acceleration of solute transport across the layer. However, a value of Pc=1.43 yields a breakthrough curve very similar to that attributed in thepaper to P c=0.0143. Furthermore, a value of Pc=1.43 combined with any combination of the other parameter values indicated inTable 1 may be seen to correspond to the attainment of a negative nal soil porosity and so represents an unrealistic scenario. A further remark should also be made regarding the model equations. A discrepancy exists between the governing equationsemployed in the model and those presented previously /H20849Peters and Smith 2002/H20850. Detailed consideration of this issue is providedbelow. Comparison of Small Deformation Model Formulations The governing equations employed in the small deformation, spa- tial coordinate models previously presented by Peters and Smith/H208492002/H20850 and the authors of the original paper are presented here for the purpose of comparison with those that may be deduced fromthe more general large deformation model. The notation is largelyconsistent with that used by Peters and Smith. For consistency,the equations used in the original paper, presented in terms ofexcess head, have been transformed and presented here in termsof excess pore pressure. The two variables are simply related g/H11005acceleration due to gravity.

Fowler Ave, ENB 118, Tampa, FL 33620, PH(813) 974-5830, email dwinters@eng.usf.edu ABSTRACT As the concrete in drilled shafts cures, extremely high internal temperatures can be generated (even when relatively small in diameter) giving rise to mass concreteconditions. When the concrete temperature exceeds safe limits, the concrete maynot cure correctly and can ultimately degrade via delayed ettringite formation.Minimizing the peak temperature (and the associated defects) can be undertaken bycasting the shafts without concrete in the core thereby removing a large amount ofthe energy producing material in a region that is least likely to benefit the structuralcapacity and that is less able to dissipate the associated core temperatures due to thepresence of the more peripheral concrete. This paper presents the field temperatureresults of shafts cast under normal conditions and the surprisingly alarmingfindings. A numerical model was subsequently calibrated and used to show the tremendous potential for voiding shafts. Finally, construction issues that are likelyto be encountered are summarized with possible solutions. INTRODUCTION Drilled shafts are large-diameter cast-in-place concrete structures that can develop enormous axial and lateral capacity and consequently, are the foundation of choice for many large bridges subject to extreme event loads such as vessel collisions. In somecases these foundation elements have been constructed without considering massconcrete effects and the possible long-term implications of the concrete integrity.Such considerations address the extremely high internal temperatures that can beGSP 158 Contemporary Issues in Deep Foundations 1082ge nerated during the concrete hydration/curing phase. This can be detrimental to the shaft durability and/or integrity in two ways: (1) short-term differential temperature-induced stresses that crack the concrete and (2) long-term degradation via prolongedexcessively high temperatures while curing. Mass concrete is generally considered to be any concrete element that develops differential temperatures between the innermost core and the outer surface that in turncan develop tension cracks. Some state DOTs have defined geometric guidelines thatidentify potential mass concrete conditions as well as limits on the differentialtemperature experienced. For instance, the Florida DOT designated any concreteelement with minimum dimension exceeding 0.91m (3 ft) and a volume to surfacearea ratio greater than 0.3m 3/m2will require precautionary measures to control temperature-induced cracking (FDOT, 2006). The same specifications set themaximum differential temperature to be 20C (35F) to control the potential forcracking. For drilled shafts, however, any element with diameter greater than 1.83m(6 ft) is considered a mass concrete element despite the relatively high volume to arearatio. The latter of the two integrity issues, i.e., excess high temperature, is presently under investigation at a number of institutions. When concrete temperature exceedssafe limits on the order of 65C (150F), the concrete may not cure correctly and canultimately degrade via latent expansive reactions termed delayed ettringite formation(DEF). This reaction may lay dormant for several years before occurring; or the expansion may not occur as it depends on numerous variables involving the concreteconstituent properties and environment. Concrete mixes with low pozzolans havelower threshold temperatures whereas higher pozzolan content concretes may notexhibit adverse effects up to 85C (185F). At present, a definitive upper temperature limit is not available (Whitfield, 2006). What is known is that staying below 65Cappears to prevent temperature-related long-term detrimental effects. CASE STUDIES Numerous case studies have documented the effects of hydrating cement in mass concrete structures. The most famous of which is perhaps the Hoover Dam project constructed during the depression from 1932 to 1935 where over 4 million cubicmeters of concrete were used. At that time it was understood that staged constructionand a cooling system would be required to help control elevated temperatures. Theprimary concern was concrete cracking from differential temperature. Without theseconsiderations, temperature dissipation was estimated to take over 100 years andtemperature-induced cracking would have severely compromised its structuralintegrity and its ability to prevent fluid ingress (DOI, 2004). Preventingmicrocracking and fluid ingress are important to warding off DEF (Collepardi, 2003)and sulfate attack generally (Stark and Bollman, 1998). Ringling Causeway Bridge. A relatively recent structure which started to shed light on drilled shafts as mass concrete was the Ringling Causeway Bridge spanning across Sarasota Bay, Florida. This segmental, post-tensioned concrete box girder bridge issupported by single column piers founded on two 2.75m (9 ft) diameter drilled shafts.The concrete mix was a type I/II with 20% cement replacement with fly ash (probablyGSP 158 Contemporary Issues in Deep Foundations 1093cla ss F). In spite of relatively cool weather (for Florida) and that it was bathed in cool bay water, the core temperature of the shafts reached 69C (157F). Figure 1 showstemperature traces over a 9 day period for the shaft center and edge as well as in thesurrounding water and air. The bay water temperature averaged 17C (63F) while theair temperature dipped as low as 3C (37F). A maximum differential temperature of37C (67F) was recorded shortly after the coldest spell. These results were used to calibrate a 3-D numerical model whereby other size shafts could be evaluated under similar pour conditions with a similar concrete mix(same energy production per cubic volume of cement). The finite difference modelincorporated a temperature time series as a boundary condition, and specified initialconditions for concrete, water (or soil) and atmosphere. A water diffusion rind of0.37m (1.2ft) was placed between the concrete shaft and the imposed boundary. Figures 2 and 3 show the peak and differential temperatures, respectively, for four modeled shaft diameters; the 2.75m shaft closely matched that observed (modelcalibration). Under these relatively cool conditions, the differential temperaturepredictions show shafts as small as 1m can exceed the recommended limit; thegenerated peak temperatures in general did not. Clearwater Test Site. The large diameter shafts used in the Ringling project were predicted to behave as mass concrete. However, more commonly used shaft sizes like 1.22m shafts have been installed without concern for years. A recent study inClearwater, Florida was conducted whereby a 7.6m deep, 1.22m diameter shaft wascast in saturated sandy to silty sandy soil complete with thermocouple and strain gageinstrumentation. The full scope of the study involved anomaly detection, shaftintegrity test method evaluations, and temperature development in a commonly usedshaft size. Only the peak and differential temperature results are presented herein.Full details of the entire study will be available upon completion of the project(FDOT).Figure 1. Temperature traces from (157F)GSP 158 Contemporary Issues in Deep Foundations 1104Us ing the measured temperature response, the same numerical model was applied to this site's conditions which were significantly different from the Ringling site. Specifically, the ambient temperature was much higher, the surrounding heatdiffusing materials were non-convective with no flowing water, and the mix designcontained little to no pozzolans. Figure 4 shows the measured and modeled resultssuperimposed with no recognizable differences aside from the diurnal temperaturefluctuations on one thermocouple channel. A peak temperature of 84C (183F) wasobserved with a maximum differential temperature of 32C (57F).6080100120140160180 0 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 Ti me(h)PeakTemperature(F) . 16263646566676 PeakTemperature(C) PeakTem peratureLi mi t 6080100120140160180 0 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 Ti me(h)PeakTemperature(F) . 16263646566676 PeakTemperature(C) PeakTem peratureLi mi t 6080100120140160180 0 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 Ti me(h)PeakTemperature(F) . 16263646566676 PeakTemperature(C) PeakTem peratureLi mi t 6080100120140160180 0 12 24 36 48 60 72 84 96 Ti me(h)PeakTemperature(F) . 16263646566676 PeakTemperature(C) 69m (27i n) PeakTem peratureLi mi t Figure 2.

Modeled temperature generation versus shaft diameter.GSP 158 Contemporary Issues in Deep Foundations 1126Mi nimizing the peak and differential temperature (and the associated defects) can be undertaken by casting shafts with a full length centroidal void. This removes a large amount of the energy producing material in a region that is least likely to benefitthe structural capacity and that is less able to dissipate the associated coretemperatures due to the presence of the more peripheral concrete. An overview ofthis concept forms the basis of this article. VOIDED SHAFTS Large prestressed piles (0.6 - 0.9m) are often cast with a cylindrical void aligned with the longitudinal axis of the pile to minimize construction weight while also reducing concrete cost. Larger diameter post-tensioned cylinder piles (0.9 - 1.8m)develop enormous axial and bending capacity with only a 15 to 20cm thick annularring of concrete (concrete pipe pile). An even larger version is plausible in the formof a voided drilled shaft. Aside from obvious constructability issues, benefits includereducing concrete volume and pouring time which in turn would relax concretesupplier issues as well as reducing hydration heat generation. Construction Considerations .Construction of drilled shafts, simply stated, involves excavating a hole deep in the ground with rotary type augers (hence the name drilled), inserting reinforcing steel into the excavation in the form of a cylindrical cage, andfilling the hole with wet/liquid concrete which occupies the space from which the soilwas excavated. To construct a shaft with a central void would involve normalexcavation of the shaft's outer diameter followed by the insertion of a centralizedsteel casing (or similar) that can adequately maintain its position during theconcreting of the annular volume. This may require that additional excavation of thesmaller diameter to allow the inner casing to adequately seal below the bottom of theouter shaft diameter (Figure 6). Shaft Concrete Steel CasingSoil SoilVoidStructural Loads Shaft Concrete Steel CasingSoil SoilVoidStructural Loads Figure 6. Conceptual schematic of a voided drilled shaft, in profile view (left) and plan view (right).GSP 158 Contemporary Issues in Deep Foundations 1137Co ncrete placement can be carried out with any method (full length pump truck hose or tremie) provided it can be easily moved during concreting to unify the concrete flow levels around the inner casing. Use of new high performance shaftconcrete would certainly be advantageous. Inner casing installation, alignment, and overcoming potential buoyancy forces are perhaps the most significant obstacles to constructing voided shafts. The physics ofbuoyancy forces only provide a problem if the concrete can form a pressure facebeneath the casing causing an upward force (Figure 7). Lateral concrete pressure willnot induce buoyancy but rather will require sufficient casing stiffness such that it willnot collapse. As there is little surface area on which upward pressure could act (openended casing), the real issue is assuring concrete will not flow underneath and fill theinner casing. Therefore, the casing must form a seal with the bottom of theexcavation in spite the upward drag force that accompanies concreting. One method of sealing the casing is socketing it beneath the toe of the voided shaft. This socket is not required to develop significant side shear with the inner casing butmust provide a reasonable seal. Advancing the inner casing into the underlying stratacould be performed by duplex drilling (drilling beneath the casing while advancing),vibratory, or oscillatory installation. When slurry stabilization is to be used, duplexdrilling would likely be preferred as vibratory installation could disrupt the integrityof the excavation walls. In most cases, cuttings would not need to be removed (or atleast not completely) from the inner casing during its installation, nor would it benecessary to perform clean-out processes within the inner casing. When full lengthtemporary casing is employed to stabilize the hole, duplex, vibratory, oscillatory, or acombination installation method would suffice to install the inner casing. An alternate method of providing a seal between the inner casing and the excavation bottom might include a flange at the base of the casing (rigid, flexible, or combinationthereof) that would both center the casing at the toe and provide a flat surface onwhich the self weight of the shaft concrete would secure the seal (Figure 8). Acombination of flange and socketing may be found most suitable in certaincircumstances.Figure 7. Net hydrostatic pressure distribution during construction.

If a flange assembly is used, the frame work is extended from and/or incorporated into theflange. Struts attached to this frame to provide the necessary stiffness serve dualpurpose by providing cage centering via properly dimensioning their connectionlocations (Figure 9). This provides better assurance of the cage placement than thepresently used plastic spacers which often are found floating to the top duringconcreting.Figure 8.

Void (inner) casing and reinforcement cage piloting framework.GSP 158 Contemporary Issues in Deep Foundations 1159St rength Considerations. Strength reduction caused by the reduced cross-sectional area has little effect on the structural performance of the foundation element in that the soil resistance is typically the limiting parameter. Therein, the geotechnicalcapacity is only affected by the reduction in end bearing area which is not typicallyconsidered a significant capacity contributor in large diameter shafts. However, if theinner casing was initially plugged or plated this capacity could be regained. Structurally, a centrally voided shaft would exhibit a reduction in axial capacity roughly proportional to the loss in cross-sectional area. In general, load casesinvolving lateral loads and overturning moments produce far more severe stresses butwould only be mildly affected by the presence of the void. For example, a 2.75m (9ft) diameter shaft with a 1.22m (60ksi) (5ksi) would result in a axial capacity reduction in the range of 17%whereas the bending capacity would be reduced less than 1%. This is due to theminimal contribution to the moment of inertia and the associated bending strengthprovided by the more centrally located concrete material. Further, the 1% reductiondoes not consider the gain in bending capacity associated with the inner steel casing ifpermanent. If the axial capacity must be maintained slightly increasing f'c to 41MPa(6ksi) would suffice. Figure 10 shows the interaction diagram for the above exampleshafts as well as the 41MPa voided option. Curing Temperature Maintenance .The numerically modeled temperature responses of a 2.75m (9ft) diameter shaft with and without a 1.22m (4 ft) diameter void are shown in Figure 11. The model parameters simulated summer ambientconditions (changing winter to summer) but used concrete heat parameters similar tothe Ringling Causeway Bridge. Note that under those conditions the peaktemperature increase in the un-voided shaft (Figure 2 and 11) is related to thedifference in ambient temperature and the lack of thermal convection in saturated soil.Figure 10.

This was well less than the recommended safe temperature, and temperature differentials momentarily approachbut do not exceed 20C. Recent unpublished results, using published cement heatparameters, also indicate that supplanting 50% cement with ground granulated blastfurnace slag does not diminish either peak or differential temperatures in large diameter shafts, but increases the centroidal peak time lag. Although the accuracy of the model has been verified with field data that supports the un-voided shaft temperature response, a voided shaft has not been constructed andtherefore has not been verified at this time. The FDOT is presently planning theconstruction of a demonstration voided shaft completely instrumented to verify temperature consideration while also addressing the constructability issues. Cost Effectiveness .Preliminary cost comparisons between the permanent steel casing required to maintain the void during concreting and the central concrete that would be displaced (not required) showed the concept to be cost effective even without the savings associated with the now un-necessary cooling system. Figure 12shows that for void diameters greater than about 1.3m (4.3ft) the cost savings fromconcrete not used offsets the cost of the steel casing. This assumes that the casing ispermanent and no innovative method of inner form-work extraction has been devised. For 2.75m shafts, voids larger than 1.2 to 1.5m are not likely to be considered as an annular thickness of 0.75m is envisioned to be the practical lower limit forconstruction. This leaves approximately 0.6m between the inner casing and thereinforcement cage for a pump truck hose or tremie to negotiate the concreteplacement process. As a result, the Figure 13 results show a break even cost for 1.3mvoids which would be reasonable for 2.75m shafts.

Further benefits accompany voiding shafts in the assurance of long-termdurability. SUMMARY It has long been understood that heat generation from curing concrete leading to differential temperatures can induce cracking stresses that may render the final structure unsound. To combat the potential problem, limiting temperature differentialshave been implemented with successful results. In the last several years, however, anawareness concerning the effects of elevated temperatures on concrete durability hasarisen as it pertains to the developed peak temperature as well as differential. This isof particular interest in the wake of higher and higher strength concrete mixes withmore energy producing constituents. Upper temperature limits are now beinginvestigated to prevent the latent expansive reactions that result (years later) fromseverely elevated temperatures while curing. Further, as the use of larger diameterdrilled shafts has heightened to accommodate extreme event limit states for longerspan bridges, drilled shafts are now being viewed as mass concrete elements thatrequire special attention. Case studies were presented where mass concrete effects were encountered in both large and small diameter shafts. Although it was predicted in the larger (2.75m)shafts, the occurrence in the smaller 1.22m shaft was somewhat surprising. Thesecond case admittedly involved severe conditions with poor dissipation tosurroundings and high ambient temperature. However, had the first case with 2.75mshafts been constructed in the conditions of the latter, a far more detrimental scenariowould have arisen. It is this potentially harmful condition that gives merit to thecasting drilled shafts with a full-length central void.Figure 12.

Over the past four years, USF have complete d four demonstration projects in which FRP was used to repair corroding piles. The FRP mate rial was directly appl ied to the submerged, partially wet or dry concrete surface. Fiberg lass and carbon were bot h used in conjunction with two types of resin - a water-activated urethane resin and an epoxy resin. In all the projects, selected piles were instrumented to allow evaluation of the post-wrap FRP corrosion mitigation performance. No particular problem s were encountered in wrapping the partially submerged piles. Linear polarization measurements indicated lower corrosion rates in the FRP wrapped specimens in comparison to their un wrapped counterpart. Th is paper provides an overview of the studies and highlights some of the important lessons that were learned. Introduction Corrosion of reinforced or prestressed piles in ti dal waters in sub-tropic al environments is a world-wide problem. The combination of wet/dry cycles in a marine environment and high temperature/high humidity can be lethal since it allows chloride ions to readily penetrate the concrete cover and destroy the pa ssive layer that normally protect s steel in concrete's alkaline environment. Subsequent electrochemical reac tions can cause steel to corrode rapidly, sometimes within eighteen months of service. Traditionally, corroded piles are re paired using methods such as ' chip and patch ', shotcreting , epoxy injection and pile jacketing (Fig. 1). Typically, chloride-fr ee concrete is placed directly adjacent to chloride contaminated concrete. This sets up new corrosion cells that lead to more corrosion. The wisdom of following procedures that result in costly re-r epair is increasingly under question. Over the past decade, several highway author ities in Canada and US have explored the possibility of using FRP for corrosion repair 1. In most applications no attempt was made to remove the chloride contaminated concre te and the wrapping was conducted under dry conditions. The availability of new resins that cure under wet conditions has spurred interest in extending FRP repair to partially submerged piles. Some full-scale FRP pile repairs were recently reported 2, 3. However, as the piles were not instrumented the performance of the FRP in reducing corrosion cannot be quantita tively assessed from these studies. Proceedings, 5th International Conference on Current and Future Trends in Bridge Design, Construction and Maintenance, Beijing, China, 234-241 120Sen and Mullins, Page 2 The University of South Florid a (USF) have completed four de monstration projects in which corroding reinforced and prestressed piles were repaired using FRP. These projects were the culmination of several research studies that investigated the role of FRP in corrosion mitigation applications 4-6. Several of the wrapped and unwra pped piles were instrumented to allow assessment of long term performance (the se results are, however, not included in this paper). Moreover, as the sites for the repairs differed, alternative inst rumentation approaches had to be explored. This pa per provides a brief overview of the projects. Complete descriptions may be found elsewhere7-9. Background The external bonding of FRP in underwater applica tions is more involved than similar repairs carried out under dry conditions. Changing tide s, winds, wave action create unfavorable conditions that need careful attention. For this reason, existing applicat ion methods developed for repair under dry conditions have to be modified and new t echniques developed to minimize the impact of the potentially adverse conditions. As repair involves restoration of strength, bond is an important consideration. As with any bonded application, surface preparation is critica l; good bond requires the substrate to have an open pore structure to ensure capillary suction of the epoxy 10. In underwater application, however, pores will be saturated with water or sm all marine organisms or algae that are likely to adversely impact bond. New surface prepar ation techniques and new measures, e.g. bonding agents, may be required to ensure satisfactory performance. FRP will only be used for repair if it leads to lower initial costs and better performance in comparison to traditional repairs. Thus, pile repa irs need to be properly engineered so that FRP use is optimized. This requires reliable in formation not only on the capacity that must be restored but also on the rela tionship between corrosion and e xpansion. Available experimental data obtained from accelerated corrosion tests may not be applicable. Whereas laboratory studies result in symmetrical cracking, the co mbined action of wind and waves result in uneven chloride penetration and asymmetric cracking in piles. More importantly, the solubility of corrosion products from accelerated testing may differ from that under field conditions. Lack of information on expans ion introduces uncertainty in design. Finally, constructability and safety are of prim e importance. The most car eful attention has to be paid to all details so that the wrap is carried out safely and expeditiously. Figure 1. Jacketed pile repair (lef t) and view with jacket removed (right) Proceedings, 5th International Conference on Current and Future Trends in Bridge Design, Construction and Maintenance, Beijing, China, 234-241 121Sen and Mullins, Page 3 Designing FRP Repairs The design of the FRP wrap requires the same information needed for conventional repair, namely, an estimate of the capacity loss that ha s to be recovered. Additionally, information is required on corrosion expansion that has to be accommodated by the FRP; several researchers have independently demonstrated1 that corrosion continues as long as the ingredients required for the electro-chemical reactions remain insi de the wrap. Thus, the FRP material simply serves as a barrier elem ent reducing future ingress of delete rious materials such as chlorides and moisture. The role of FRP in pile repair is therefore twofol d: first to restore lost flexural capacity due to corrosion of steel; second to pr ovide resistance to withsta nd expansive forces caused by corrosion products. The former requires fibers to be oriented parallel to the direction of the reinforcing or prestressing steel, i.e. along the length, while the latter requires fibers in the transverse or hoop direction, i.e. perpendicular to the steel. This can be met either by using two different sets of uni-directi onal fibers - one for each directio n or preferably, by using bi- directional FRP material. Research has shown that there is no simple re lationship between metal loss and strength. This uncertainty stems from its dependence on othe r factors such as the bond between steel and concrete, the confinement prov ided by the ties and ductility reduction in steel due to corrosion. Given this uncertainty, it may be prudent to assume a safe, conservative value. This was the case in the demonstration projects where capacity loss was taken as 20%. As noted already, at the presen t time there is a lack of re liable information on transverse expansion caused by corrosion. In view of this, a simplified procedure 8,11 was developed. For design, the expansion strain was assumed as 0.1% (approximately 3 times the ultimate concrete tensile strain assumed to be 10% of the ultimate concrete failure strain). A simplified two step design procedure was developed in which the requirements for strength and corrosion expansion were uncoupled. The st rength requirements were first met by strain compatibility analysis in which the contri bution of the FRP to the tensile (but not compressive) capacity were determined thr ough interaction diagrams for the assumed shortfall in strength. The confining lateral st rain provided by this strengthening was then checked to ensure that it satisfied the maximum assumed expansion of 0.1%. Results obtained were found to be reasonable when compared to solutions from competing methods developed for seismic retrofit 8,11. For bi-directional ca rbon fiber, only two FRP layers were required. Twice as many layers were required for fiberglass because of its lower strength and stiffness. FRP Materials Two types of materials were used. One was a pre-preg, the other a wet lay up. The pre-preg system was from Air Logistics in which all the FR P material was cut to size, resin-saturated in the factory and sent to the site in hermetica lly sealed pouches. The wet lay up system required on-site impregnation and was from Fyfe excep ting for the Allen Creek Bridge where an alternative system was used. As this repair was carried out under dr y conditions inside a coffer dam8 it is not included here. Both carbon a nd fiberglass were used. Details of the properties of the fiber and the resin as provide d by the suppliers are summarized in Tables 1- 212-13.

The first site, Allen Creek Bridge, Clearwater, FL is located in sha llow, relatively calm waters; the subsequent repairs were carried out on piles supporting th e Friendship Trails Br idge and the Gandy Bridge that span Tampa Bay, Florida's largest estuary that flows into the Gulf of Mexico. The procedure for wrapping under water was identical to that above water. Usually, wrapping was scheduled for low tide when the submerged region could be readily accessed. On rare occasions when the water level was higher, diving masks were used. Allen Creek Bridge Allen Creek Bridge is located on the busy US 19 highway connecting Clearwater and St. Petersburg, FL. The original bri dge built in 1950 was supported on reinforced concrete piles driven into Allen Creek. In 1982, the bridge was widened and the widened section was supported on 35 cm square prestressed piles. The waters from Allen Creek flow east into Ol d Tampa Bay that in turn joins the Gulf of Mexico to the south. The environment is very aggressive; all the reinforced concrete piles from the original construction had been rehab ilitated several times. At low tide, the water level in the deepest portion of the creek is a bout 0.8m. At maximum hi gh tide it is about 1.9m. This shallow depth meant that th e underwater wrap did not require divers and could be carried out on a ladder. Instrumentation was installed to allow linear polarization and corrosion potential measurements to be made 4 without junction boxes and wirin g. Cores were taken from various locations to determine the chloride content at the level of the prestressing strands. Results indicated that the strands were corroding t hough there were no visible signs of corrosion. Proceedings, 5th International Conference on Current and Future Trends in Bridge Design, Construction and Maintenance, Beijing, China, 234-241 123Sen and Mullins, Page 5 Surface Preparation Pile surfaces were covered with marine growth that had to be scraped off. Additionally, two of the four corners that were not rounded but chamfered had to be ground using an air- powered grinder. This was a difficult operation pa rticularly for sections that were below the water line. Quick-setting hydraulic cement was used to fill any depression, discontinuities and to provide a smooth surface. The entire surface was pressure washed using freshwater to remove all dust, marine algae just prior to wrapping. FRP Wrap Two different schemes using two different mate rials were evaluated. In each scheme four piles were wrapped with two other instrumented piles serving as controls. In the first scheme, cofferdam construction was used and the piles wrapped using a bi-directional FRP in wet layup under dry conditions. Complete details may be found in Ref. 8. As this was wrapped under 'perfect' conditions, its performance provided a means for evaluating piles that were directly wrapped in water using th e water activated urethane resin. Post-wrap corrosion measurements showed that the corrosion rate was smaller for the wrapped piles compared to the unwrapped controls 4,8. However, rates are still small. Tampa Bay Bridges The Friendship Trails Bridge and the Gandy Bridge are two of four bridges that cross Tampa Bay. When it was first opened to traffic in th e 1920's it was the longest bridge in the United States reducing the distance between Tampa and St. Petersburg by 72 km. The environment is very corrosive and the majority of the piles supporting these bridges have sustained severe corrosion damage and needed to be repaired. Three demonstration studies were carried out on these piles over the period 2004-06. All piles repaired were 50 cm x 50 cm either reinforced or prestressed concrete piles. They were all located in waters that are approximate ly 4.9 m deep. This meant that ladders could no longer be used in this situation. An innovative scaffolding system (Fig. 2) was designed and fabricated for the study. It was lightweight, mo dular yet sufficiently rigid when assembled to support 4-6 people. The scaffolding was suspe nded from the pile cap and extended 2.74 m below the pile cap. Its mesh flooring provided a secure platform around the pile that allowed the wrap to be carried out unimpeded in knee de ep waters without the need for diving gear. Figure 2. Patching damage (l eft) and grinding surface (right). Proceedings, 5th International Conference on Current and Future Trends in Bridge Design, Construction and Maintenance, Beijing, China, 234-241 124Sen and Mullins, Page 6 Two different FRP systems were used. One was the water-activated, pre-preg urethane resin system used in the Allen Creek Bridge. The othe r system used a special epoxy that could cure in water. The first system was used to wrap f our piles - two using carb on and two using glass. In the second system, the FRP material had to be pre-impregnated on site prior to the wrap. Two piles were wrapped with fiberglass us ing this system. Of the two, one was an experimental FRP system that combined wr apping with a sacrific ial cathodic protection system. Two other unwrapped piles in a similar initi al state of disrepair were used as controls to evaluate the performance of the wrapped piles. As for the piles in the Allen Creek Bridge, seve ral piles were instrumented but using a special rebar probe developed by the Florid a Department of Transportation 7. This allowed measurement of the corrosion current betwee n the locations where they were located. Reductions in current compared to the controls were expected to provide a measure of the efficacy of the FRP wrap. Unlike, Allen Cr eek Bridge, junction boxes and wiring were required to allow readings to be taken. Prel iminary corrosion measurements were however inconclusive because the system had not yet stabi lized following the installation of the probes. The FRP material for the first system was identic al to that used in Allen Creek Bridge, i.e. unidirectional longitudinal layer followed by tran sverse bi-directional material. For the second system, all material was uni-directional. The sc affolding system enabled the wrapping to be carried out with relative ease. On average, it took between 30 minutes and 45 minutes to wrap a pile depending on the number of FRP layers. For the wet-lay-up syst em, it took additional time to impregnate the FRP material and transport it to the pile site. The to tal time taken averaged about 90 minutes in this case. Fig. 3 shows the installation of the longitudinal layer at the corners followed by the transverse layer that was applied spirally with no overlap. Fig. 4 shows a view of the wrapped piles and a close-up view more than two years late r showing marine deposition on the wrap. Figure 3. Installation vertical (left) transverse layer (right) typically at low tide Proceedings, 5th International Conference on Current and Future Trends in Bridge Design, Construction and Maintenance, Beijing, China, 234-241 125Sen and Mullins, Page 7 Figure 4. View of FR P wrapped piles when new (left) and after 2 years (right) New Developments The results from the initial repairs carried ou t on the piles supporting Allen Creek Bridge and the Tampa Bay bridges showed that it was feasib le to wrap corroding piles under typical field conditions. Corrosion rate measurements also indicated that the FR P wrapping led to a reduction in the corrosion rate. However, th e FRP-concrete bond was found to be poorer when compared to the bond that wa s obtained under la boratory conditions8,14. Laboratory studies were undertaken over the past year to evaluate alternative strategies used by the aerospace industry to improve the und erwater FRP-concrete bond. Two candidate techniques widely used in aerospace (1) vacuum bagging and (2) pressure bagging were evaluated. Prototype systems were developed and the bond evaluated both non-destructively and destructively9. Both techniques worked but in the subsequent field demonstration, pressure bagging was used. Qualitatively, th e bond appeared to be much improved though no on-site destructive bonds have yet been conducte d. Such tests are planned in the future. The USF research team has just received funding for implemen ting a pilot sacrificial cathodic protection system. This is expected to be implemented over the next several months at the same Friendship Trails Bridge site. Conclusions This paper provides a brief ove rview of demonstration projec ts in which instrumented reinforced and prestressed piles were wra pped using different FRP systems. Initially, wrapping was carried out directly under water using ladders. Subsequently, a lightweight scaffolding system was developed that could be suspended from the pile cap. With all-around access, FRP wrapping was conducted with ease. Based on our experience, it is clear that it is feasible to use FRP for underwater corrosion repair. The performance of the FRP in slow ing down the corrosion rate appears to be comparable to that determined from laborator y testing. Visual inspection suggests that the repairs have held up well with the longest over four years old at this time. More detailed examination may be possible in the future wh en the Allen Bridge is replaced. However, on- site pull-out tests on several piles repaired in the initial phase have shown that the FRP-concrete bond was poorer than that obtai ned under dry laboratory conditions. Proceedings, 5th International Conference on Current and Future Trends in Bridge Design, Construction and Maintenance, Beijing, China, 234-241 126Sen and Mullins, Page 8 A pressure bagging technique wa s developed and successfully implemented last year to address this variability in bond. While no on-site pullout tests ha ve yet been conducted, visual examination suggests that the bond was better. E fforts are currently underway to incorporate a sacrifical cathodic protection (C P) system within the wrap th at can stop corrosion. With all the development work carried out, the prospect s of FRP emerging as an alternative cost effective pile repair system appear bright.

Twenty two, one-third scale prestressed piles were cast with built-in chloride. Titanium reference electrodes and thermocouples were placed inside the specimens at the time of casting. Sixteen of the speci mens were wrapped after 28 days using CFRP or GFRP. The remaini ng six unwrapped specimens served as controls. The specim ens were exposed to simulated tidal cycles under outdoor ambient conditions for nearly three years. Linear polarization measurements were taken throughout the exposure period to monitor the corrosion rate of the steel. At the end of the exposure period, gravimetric tests were conducted to measure the metal loss in both wrapped and unwrapped specimens . The trends predicted by the linear polarization measurements were confirmed by gravimetric results. Corrosion rates in wrapped specimens were significantly lower than that in identica lly exposed controls. KEY WORDS: corrosion; underwater; FRP; prestress; repair INTRODUCTION Over the past decade a number of field demonstration projects have been completed in which FRP was us ed for repair and strengthening corroded structures. The majority of these applications related to above ground elements such as bridge colu mns or bents. Mo re recently, the availability of resins that can cure in water has led to similar demonstration projects for repairi ng corroded substructure concrete piles in tidal waters. Unlike cathodic protection that can stop the electrochemical reactions responsible for corrosion, FRP only se rves as a barrier element that slows down the ingress of deleterious elements responsible for corrosion. In the circumstance, in formation on corrosion rates in FRP wrapped elements is of great interest to highway authorities since it can be used to assess the life of the repair and provide a realistic estimate of its cost. A number of studies have been c onducted in which the performance of FRP wrapped concrete members was experimentally determined. Details may be found in a recent st ate-of-the-art review paper, Sen 2003. The majority of these studies were for reinforced concrete elements; information on prestressed elements is more limited (Mullins et al. 2001). This paper provides an overview of an experimental study in which instrumented FRP wr apped and unwrapped corroding prestressed specimens were exposed to simulated tidal cycles under ambient outdoor conditions. Their performance was evaluated both non-destructively and by destructive gravimetric testing. The study was part of an overall research effort to assess the feasibility of using FRP for corrosion repair of prestressed piles in Florida's tidal waters. Complete details of this study ma y be found elsewhere (Suh et al. 2005, Suh et al. 2007). BACKGROUND Concrete's alkaline e nvironment normally protec ts steel by forming a passive layer that limits access of oxygen, moisture and other aggressive species. This protective layer can be destroyed if the pH drops below 11.5 or at high alkalinities if chloride ions penetrate the concrete. In Florida's tidal waters, the high concentration of chloride ions combined with high humidity an d temperature allow chloride ions to reach the level of the reinforcem ent even for high quality concrete. The chloride profile in piles varies depending on its location relative to the mean sea level. It is highest closest to the surface in the \"splash zone\" (0.6-1.8m of the mean sea level) because of the cumulative effect of evaporation of salt water from th e pile surface. However, these high chloride levels are localized near the surface. In contrast, in the submerged region, chloride concen trations are lower but penetrate deeper. Corrosion is generally assumed to be initiated when the chloride ion concentration reaches a critical threshold value of 1.2 kg Cl -/m3 (Mindess et. al. 2003). This threshol d depends on many factors, the principal being the oxygen supply at the surface of the reinforcing steel. Since oxygen's solubility in water is very small, if the concrete pores are saturated with water (as is the case for piles in tidal waters), the chloride threshold for corrosion initiation can be one order of Proceedings of the 17th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference Lisbon, Portugal, July 1-6, Vol. 4, pp. 3504-3507 128 Time (hours)Water Level (cm) 6 12 18 24 30 80 (High) 35 (Low) magnitude greater than that exposed to the atmosphere (Bertolini et. al. 2004). Because concrete cover in marine applications is larger, chloride ions take longer to reach the st eel surface than under atmospheric exposure. Given that the concrete pores in the splash zone and in the submerged region of the pile are saturated with moisture, the chloride threshold for corrosion is higher. Co llectively this means that high levels of chloride are present over larger areas making pitting corrosion less likely. Pitting corrosion is likely in piles that cracked while they were being driven into the ground. EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM Surveys of corrosion-damaged piles conducted by the research team identified corrosion damage to be most prevalent in 45 cm square prestressed piles. For this reason, a 1/3rd scale model of these piles was selected for the laboratory investigation. The test specimens were 15 cm. x 15 cm with a 25 mm cover. Prestressing was provided using f our 7.9 mm, 1860 MPa strands. A fifth unstressed strand was provided to accelerate corrosion using a constant current system in another study. When stressed to code specified limits, the effective prestress in the specimens exactly matched that of the 45 cm prototype. The specimen length was set as 1.52 m. This ensure d that their weight (under 900 N) was such that it could be moved without requiring lifting equipment. To initiate the corrosion process, chloride was mixed with the concrete during fabrication. The chloride was confined to a symmetric 55 cm region that corresponded to 1.65 m splash zone in the prototype. The chloride ion content was kept at 3% by weight of the cementitious material that corresponded to a 15.1 kg/m 3. This is an order of magnitude higher than the threshold for initiating corrosion under atmospheric exposure. To ensure all specimens were identical they were cast simultaneously in a specially adapted prestressing bed at a commercial prestressing facility. To facilitate wrapping, w ood inserts with the appropriate radii were placed at the corners of the form. Similarly, special trowels were used to finish the top surface so that they were also curved. These simple measures greatly simplified the preparation work needed for subsequent wrapping. Activated titanium reference electrodes and thermocouples were installed prior to casting of concrete to allow the post-wrap performance to be non-destructively monitored (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 View of titanium reference electrode and thermocouple Wrapping Of the 22 specimens used in the study, 16 were wrapped using commercially available CFRP a nd GFRP material. Wrapping was carried after the concrete had reached its 28 day strength. The number of layers was varied from 1 to 4 to allow its effect on the corrosion rate to be assessed. The wrap was applied over a 90 cm length symmetric with respect to the specimen. This meant that it extended 17.5 cm. symmetrically beyond the 55 cm chloride contaminated region. Since the specimen was 1.5 m in length, 30 cm concrete sections were not wrapped at the top and bottom. Details of the material properties of the FRP material and their manner of installation may be found in the final report, Suh et al 2005. Exposure Of the 22 specimens, 20 specimens were placed upright in a 1.82m wide x 3.05m long x 1.22m deep containing 3.5% saltwater to allow tidal cycles to be simulated. Two other controls were placed upright in a similar environment, but indoors. The water level at high tide was 80 cm from the bottom and 35 cm at low tide. The change in the water level reflected tide changes in the Tampa Bay area. The water level was automatically changed every six hours (see Fig. 2) so that two expos ure cycles were completed every day. It may be noted that at low tide the water level was 35 cm or 5 cm above lowest point wrap. Thus, the exposure ensured that a portion of the wrap was always submerged; a part was subjected to wetting and drying conditions while the part at the top was always dry. The two other unwrapped controls kept indoor s were similarly exposed to twice daily tidal cycles. Fig. 2 Schematic of exposure cycle Non Destructive Monitoring Throughout the exposure period, a data logger was used to record the temperature inside each of the sp ecimens. Additionall y, half-cell and linear polarization measurements were taken at periodic intervals using a PR monitor. These measurements were carried out both before and after wrapping. All measurements for all specimens were carried out at low tide. Typical results from the non-destructive monitoring are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 that compare the variation in the half-cell potential (with respect to a copper-copper sulfate reference electrode) and the Reference Electrodes Thermocouple Proceedings of the 17th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference Lisbon, Portugal, July 1-6, Vol. 4, pp. 3504-3507 129 corrosion rate for unwrapped (control s) and wrapped specimens.

This coincided with the appearance of visible cracks in the splash zone in the controls (Fig. 5). Following this period, the readings for the wra pped specimen became less negative while that for the unwrapped specimens became more negative. However, all readings were more negative than -350mV signifying that the probability of corrosion in all the specimens exceeded 90%.

After an initial period of about 350 days when there is little difference in the corrosion rates in the wrapped and unwrapped specimens, the rates for unwrapped controls increase while those of the wrapped specimens decrease. Only results for the CFRP wrap with two layers is shown for clarity. However, averaged results for all the layers showed similar trends. More plots may be found in the final report, Suh et al. 2005 At the end of the exposure period of nearly 3 years, the average corrosion rate in the controls was 0.018 mm/year but only 0.0055 mm/year, or nearly a third in the wrapped specimens. These rates are commensurate with corrosion where vi sible damage can be expected within 2 to 10 years. This contrast s with the controls where visible corrosion was observed within 1 year. Fig. 5 Cracked control (L) vs uncracked FRP wrapped specimen (R) Following the completion of the exposur e period, the actual metal loss was determined from destructive gravimetric testing. In the tests, the strands were carefully retrieved from the specimens, cleaned and carefully weighed to measure the actual metal loss. Results are summarized in Table 1. It may be seen from Table 1 that the metal loss in strands for the controls (6.6%) was about twice (3.3-3.4%) that in the wrapped specimens. The performance of CFRP and GFRP were also comparable. There was no improvement in performance for specimens wrapped with more than two FRP layers.

The results from both non destructive corrosion monitoring and the gravimetric testing clearly indicated that the FRP material was effective in slowing down but not stopping co rrosion. Total metal loss in the strands in the wrapped specimens wa s about half that in the unwrapped controls. Additionally, control sp ecimens developed cracks along the strand line after about 1 year of exposure. Aside from the total metal loss, it was found that there were 30 wire breaks in the six control specimens. In contrast there was similar breakage in only 1 of the 16 wrapped specimens. This breakage of wires was most likely the result of pitting corrosion facilitated by Wrap Wet/dry cycles Wrap Wet/dry cycles Proceedings of the 17th International Offshore and Polar Engineering Conference Lisbon, Portugal, July 1-6, Vol. 4, pp. 3504-3507 130 cracking. Thus FRP wrapping le d to significantly improved performance. A concern among DOT officials is the possible upward movement of the corrosion cells from the wrapped region as has been observed in jacketed piles. However, no simila r movement could be discerned in the gravimetric testing. This could be because the wrap extended 17.5 cm above the chloride contaminated region. Also, there was no localized corrosion in the always submerged region as had been observed in a study supported by Texas DOT (Berver et al. 2001). CONCLUSIONS This paper presents a brief overview of a multi-year study to evaluate the role of FRP in corrosion mitigation application. The specimens tested were cast with high built in chlorides comparable to that observed in field studies (Mullins et al. 2005). Exposure was limited to two daily wet/dry cycles under outdoor ambient conditions. Other than the chloride cast at the time of fabrication to initiate corrosion, the study therefore accurately modeled field conditions for piles in a marine environment. The results presented provide a realistic measure of the likely performance of FRP in mitigating corrosion in a marine environment after chloride ingress had led to a destruction of the protective passive layer. The results from the test (Figs. 3-5 and Table 1) conclusively show that if the wrap is properly applied corrosion performance is significantly improved not only in terms of overall metal loss but by the absence of wire breaks. The wire breaks in the controls were likely the result of pitting corrosion. Given the uniform cast-in-chloride, the anodic region was large and corrosion should have been uniform. However, cracking of the controls (Fig. 5) provided increased oxygen supply and changes in chloride level at selected locati ons along the length of the pile. Such changes facilitated the formation of micro-cells and pitting corrosion leading to breakages in 30 wires in the controls. In contrast, there was similar breakage in only one wra pped specimen. Thus, wrapping protects the pile by greatly diminis hing the extent of pitting corrosion in the most vulnerable region of the splash zone. A surprising finding was that two FRP layers provided optimal protection. The precise reason for this is not known. However, it could be because the additional layers were not sufficiently saturated with resin. Alternatively, it could also signify that the role of the FRP as a barrier element was not improved when additional layers were provided. Oxygen and moisture already present in the specimens allowed the electrochemical reactions to continue regardless. In the study, the specimens were wr apped after chloride contamination. Had piles been wrapped immediately after installation, the ingress of chlorides would be stopped and the performance would be even better. In any event since the FRP material also provides strengthening, it can help restore lost capacity. It should be noted that the FRP wrapping was carried out under dry conditions where the FRP-concrete bond was excellent. Tests on field repairs have shown that the FRP- concrete bond can be variable depending on the resin system used. Thus, the results presented in the paper are valid for situations where bond is good over the entire length of the wrap. However, recent advances by the USF research team suggest that it is possible to ensure excellent bond even in field situations (Mulli ns et al 2007).

As a result, they have been favoured for conducting emergency bridge repairs where speed is of essence. The availability of resins that can cure under water has made it possible to similarly extend its application to substructure elements suchas partially submerged damaged piles. Such repairs can be carried out using the same strategies that were successfully used in recent demonstration projects in which FRP was used to repair and rehabilitate corrosion-damaged piles. In the projects two disparate FRP systems - a pre-preg and a wet layup - were used and both carbon and glass evaluated.

Their lightweight, high strength and resistance to chemicalsoer obvious benets. In fabric form, they provide unpa-ralled flexibility. Moreover, as bers can be oriented inany direction, their use can be optimized. This makesFRP particularly suited for emergency repairs ( Fig. 1 ) where damage can be multi-directional and speed ofstrength restoration critically important. The emergence of new adhesives [1]that allow FRP to be bonded to wet concrete surfaces makes it possible toeconomically conduct emergency repairs on sub-structureelements. Fig. 2 shows impact damage that led to both cross-section loss and breakage of the spiral ties. Conven-tional repairs will require the cross-section to be enlarged to accommodate new ties. If instead, FRP were used itwould only be necessary to re-form the cross-section andapply bi-directional layers that could restore lost tensile capacity while providing equivalent lateral support to thelongitudinal steel. Moreover, the application of a protec-tive UV (ultra-violet) coating on the wrap of the right colorwill render the repaired pile indistinguishable from otherundamaged piles. The aesthetics of FRP repair is one ofits unheralded benets. The techniques developed recently for underwater FRP corrosion repair of piles [2-4] are equally applicable for repairing other types of damage. This paper distils relevantinformation from recently completed demonstration pro-jects [5,6] in which two disparate FRP systems were used for repairing corroding reinforced concrete piles. In the pro-jects both carbon and glass were used and the piles instru-mented to monitor performance. Additionally, bond testswere carried out after two years to evaluate the residual bond. An overview of the studies is presented with particu- lar emphasis on changes that will be needed for emergencyrepairs. Recommendations are also made regarding strate-gies that were found to be the most eective. 1359-8368/$ - see front matter /C2112006 Elsevier Ltd.

Problem statement The application of FRP wrap for underwater repair and rehabilitation of piles is problematic for the following reasons: 1. Surface preparation suitable for dry conditions cannot be directly used for wrapping partially submerged ele-ments. New methods and equipment may be required. 2. All round access to the pile in deep waters poses many logistic problems. Meticulous planning is required andsafety issues must be carefully addressed. Moreover, even if the application is perfect, there may be unexpected bond problems. For example, since the FRP material is a barrier element it can trap moisture that is already inside the pile. Evaporation of this water by heatgenerated during curing may trigger localized debonding.While bond is not as critical for applications where theFRP material is wrapped completely around the pile, itcan accelerate corrosion in the debonded region. It is however unrealistic to expect satisfactory resolution of all potential problems given the limited number of eldstudies that have been completed to date. Some of the solu- tions that have evolved are described with particular refer- ence to a recently completed eld study [5]. 3. Field demonstration project The friendship trails bridge, formerly the ''old'' Gandy Bridge, is one of four bridges spanning Tampa Bay, themost famous being the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. Originallybuilt in 1956, it was scheduled for demolition in 1997 fol- lowing the construction of the new Gandy Bridge. Instead, it was rehabilitated and converted into a recreational trailthat is closed to vehicular trac. The 4.2 km (2.6 mile) bridge is supported by 254 piers and 22 columns numbered 1-276 extending east from St.Petersburg in Pinellas County to Tampa in HillsboroughCounty. Seventy seven percent of the 254 piers have neededto be repaired indicative of a very aggressive environment. As a result, the site provides a rich history of the various attempts made over the years to repair piles. The piles selected for this study were identied following a detailed survey of the site. Its aim was to locate piles onthe Hillsborough side of Tampa Bay (Hillsborough Countyfunded the study) that were in the same general state of dis-repair. Piers 99, 100, and 101 were found suitable for thispurpose. Pier 99 was a six pile bent while piers 100 and 101 were both four pile bents. Details of the eight piles selected for the study are sum- marized in Table 1 . Piles are identied by the Pier Number followed by the letter N or S signifying 'north' or 'south'. Six of the eight piles were instrumented. Instrumentationconsisted of special rebar probes developed by the FloridaDepartment of Transportation that were installed at twolocations along a pile length to provide a measure of the corrosion current. Details on the performance of these probes and results obtained may be found elsewhere [5]. The four piles in Pier 100 were wrapped using a pre-preg system developed by Air Logistics referred to subsequentlyas System A [7]. Two were wrapped with carbon and two others with glass. The glass wrap required a greater ofnumber of layers to compensate for its lower strength.The two piles in Pier 101 were wrapped with a wet layup system developed by Fyfe referred to subsequently as Sys- tem B [8]. Both piles were wrapped using glass. One of the piles used an experimental zinc mesh sacricial cathodicprotection system. The other was a regular glass wrap. The wrap length extended to the underside of the pile cap excepting for instrumented piles that were 15 cm(6 in.) shorter to accommodate junction boxes needed formeasuring the corrosion current. It extended 45 cm (18 in.) above the high water line and 15 cm (6 in.) below the low water line. The wrap length in non-instrumented Fig. 2.

Mullins / Composites: Part B 38 (2007) 751-758 141piles was 1.83 m (6 ft) long. It was 1.68 m (5 ft 6 in.) in instrumented piles. 4. Material properties System A: The Aquawrap/C210Repair system [7]uses a unique water-activated urethane resin in con- junction with custom woven FRP fabric that can be wrapped around the pile. Because it is water-activated, the FRP material must bepre-impregnated with the resin and sent to thesite in hermetically sealed foil pouches. Thepouches are opened just prior to applicationto prevent premature curing by atmosphericmoisture. Properties of the uni-directional andbi-directional bers used as reported by the manufacturer are summarized in Table 2 . Note the higher capacity of carbon compared to glass. System B: System B used Tyfo /C210SEH-51A [8]and was used to wrap two piles in Pier 101. Tyfo/C210 SEH-51A is a custom weave, uni-directionalglass fabric that is normally used with Tyfo-SEpoxy. However, for the underwater applica- tion, Tyfo /C210SW-1 underwater epoxy was used. The epoxy was mixed at the site and the FRP fabric impregnated just prior to use. Propertiesof materials as provided by the manufacturerare summarized in Table 3 .5. Composite jacket design The FRP wrap must restore the lost axial, bending and shear capacity due to damage, e.g. corrosion, impact, reetc. Available ACI [9]and ISIS [10]guidelines provide design equations and worked out numerical examples.Design manuals for specic systems are also available,e.g. Fyfe Co., [11]. The provisions in all the guides are com- parable though equations are more simplied for the pro-prietary systems. axial, flexural and shearstrengthening are considered independently; their interac-tion, necessary for designing pile wraps, is not considered. The low strain capacity of the FRP makes the maximum permissible strain, the critical parameter in design. Forstrengthening applications, ACI 440 guidelines [9]species strain limits for both ''contact-critical'' (FRP in intimate contact with the substrate with no specic adhesion requirement) and ''bond-critical'' (minimum adhesionrequired since load transfer is by bond) applications. Forpiles, the limit for contact-critical application applies asthe FRP material is wrapped completely around the cir-cumference. This is set as the lower of 0.4% or 75% ofthe FRP design rupture strain. The latter limit was estab-lished from tests to avoid loss of aggregate interlock that can occur at strains below the ultimate ber strain. As piles corrode, they expand in the lateral direction since the volume of the corrosion products can be as much 600% of the original steel [12]. To accommodate such a large potentially uniform increase, a lower maximum strainlimit may be appropriate. This can be based on experimen-tal data [13]or from other considerations. A strain limit of 0.1% - approximately three times the maximum tensile strain leading to cracking - was selectedfor designing the FRP to withstand corrosion expansion[5,6]. This value was used since reported experimental strains, calculated from the total circumferential increase,Table 1 Test pile details Pier number Repair system Specimen type Pile name Instrumentation Pier 99 None Control 99-N Yes None Control 99-S Yes Pier 100 Aquawrap/C210Carbon 1 + 2 layersa100-N Yes Carbon 1 + 2 layers 100-N* No Glass 2 + 4 layers 100-S* No Glass 2 + 4 layers 100-S Yes Pier 101 Tyfo/C210SEH-51A Glass 2 + 4 layers 101-N Yes Tyfo Zinc Cathodic Protection Glass 2 + 4 layers 101-S Yes aSignies number of layers in the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively.

Sen, G. Mullins / Composites: Part B 38 (2007) 751-758 753 142tend to be on the high side because it includes unrestrained movement of the crack. Interaction diagrams can be developed for FRP strengthening, as for reinforced concrete columns, by usingstrain compatibility analysis [14]. The only dierence is that the equations incorporate the contribution of the FRP. Since FRP wrapping can provide increased tensile but lim- ited compressive strength increase, only the tensile contri-bution was incorporated in the analysis. Also, as theconnement eect of concrete leads to modest increasesin the ultimate axial capacity in non-circular sections, itwas ignored. As with most strengthening applications, therole of the FRP is passive. That is, the FRP is unstressedexcept for additional load applied to the structure after it has been retrotted. Fig. 3 shows a typical interaction diagram for the design of the wrap used for underwater corrosion repair. In the applications, capacity loss was estimated to be 20%. Itwas found that this could be restored by using two trans-verse and one longitudinal carbon layer for the materialproperties outlined in Table 2 . For the weaker glass, two longitudinal and four transverse layers were required torestore full capacity [6]. 6. Access to piles All around access to the pile is needed to allow the FRP material to be wrapped around the circumference expedi-tiously. In shallow waters, access is not a problem and lad-ders can be used. For deeper waters, a boat may be used towrap the pile above water while divers can wrap the sub-merged region ( Fig. 4 ). This solution can be economical where repairs are to be carried out on a single isolated pile. In the eld demonstration study however, several piles in the same bent were wrapped. For this case, a scaoldingsystem was more suitable since it allowed ready access toall the piles. The scaold was built using 19 mm (3/4 in.)#9 expanded steel mesh on a 5 cm \u00b75c m\u00b70.6 cm (2 in.\u00b72 in.\u00b71/4 in.) steel angle framework. The sti but lightweight mesh helped minimize the forces from wave action while providing a secure working surface. Its modu- lar design meant it could be placed around one or morepiles depending on the application. Each framework con-sisted of two half-sections with cut-outs sized for the spe-cic pile. The four-part platform was 10 m (33 ft) long and 2.13 m (7 ft) wide when fully assembled. Advantage was taken ofthe overhead pile cap to suspend the scaold at an appro- priate elevation. In this case it was 2.74 m (9 ft) from the pile cap to allow piles to be wrapped over a 1.83 m (6 ft)length starting from the underside of the cap.

Mullins / Composites: Part B 38 (2007) 751-758 143was bolted to the steel angles to delineate the extent of the underwater platform ( Fig. 5 ). 7. Surface preparation Surface preparation for contact-critical applications is dened as providing ''continuous, intimate contact'' [9] between the concrete substrate and the FRP material. Ina marine environment this implies removal of all marinegrowth. As for dry conditions, depressions and voids on the concrete surface have to be patched using suitable material that is compatible with the concrete substrate. Ifthere are corners, they need to be ground to a minimumof 19 mm (3/4 in.) [9]radius to avoid stress concentration in the wrapping material. In case of emergency repairs, it may be necessary to re- form the concrete section. Advantage should be taken toinsert appropriate cut-outs with the required radius inside the form so that the corners of the formed surface are auto- matically rounded. Otherwise, the sharp corners wouldhave to be ground to the required 19 mm (3/4 in.) radius.This approach was successfully used in a recently com-pleted study [6]that investigated the eectiveness of FRP in corrosion mitigation application for new specimens.Fig. 6 shows one of the wood trim cut-outs placed inside the form of the prestressing bed prior to concreting.In the demonstration project, there was signicant mar- ine growth at the water line that was removed with a scra-per prior to wrapping. Projecting parts of the concretesurface were chipped using a hammer and chisel. All fourcorners were chamfered and ground to a 19 mm (3/4 in.)radius using an underwater pneumatic grinder. To provide a smooth surface, quick setting hydraulic cement was used to ll surface voids. Finally, all surfaces were pressurewashed using fresh water to remove all dust, debris, andremaining marine growth just prior to wrapping. 8. Pre-preg system The pre-preg system was used for wrapping four piles in Pier 100. The two piles at the north end were wrapped using one layer of unidirectional carbon ber and two lay-ers of bi-directional carbon bers. The two piles in the south end of the same pier were wrapped using two layers of unidirectional glass bers and four layers of bi-direc-tional glass bers. As this was a pre-preg, all FRP materialwas pre-saturated in a factory and sent to the site in hermi-tically sealed pouches. The FRP material was removedfrom the packet just prior to the wrap, unrolled and wasready to be applied to the prepared surface. Wrapping commenced from the pile top or 15 cm (6 in.) below the underside of the pile cap for the instrumentedpiles located in the north and south ends because of thepresence of the junction box. The longitudinal layer wasplaced vertically followed by two transverse layers thatwere spirally wrapped around the pile without overlap(Fig. 7 ). In case of glass, this sequence was repeated since two longitudinal layers and four transverse layers wereneeded to provide the same strength. A 25 cm (10 in.) wide glass ber veil with a 5 cm (2 in.) overlap was used to consolidate the wrap and provide abetter nish. This was covered by plastic stretch lm tokeep the wrap in place as it cured. On an average it tookless than one hour to wrap a pile. The FRP was allowed to cure for one day. After removal of the stretch lm, all wrapped piles were painted Fig. 5. Scaolding system suspended from pile cap. Fig. 6. Curved wood trim inserts at corners. Fig. 7.

Wet layup system The Tyfo/C210SEH-51A composite system was used to wrap piles 101N and 101S. The original plan was to use two dif- ferent epoxies one for the submerged region and the otherfor the dry region in the pile. This scheme was tried on pile101N. However, because of wave action, the dry region wasnot dry and resulted in observable poor bond between theFRP and the pile. This wrap was later removed. As a result,the same underwater epoxy Tyfo /C210SW-1 was used for both piles along with Tyfo/C210SEH-51A berglass fabric. Unlike System A that was a 'pre-preg', in System B the bers had to be impregnated with resin on-site. This gavegreater flexibility since wrap lengths could be adjustedbut posed greater logistic problems since impregnationhad to be done on-site in a timely manner. This requiredcareful planning and system redundancies to avoid unex-pected problems arising from equipment malfunction. The FRP fabric for pile 101S was impregnated by hand. For pile 101N re-wrapped three months later, a resinimpregnator was used ( Fig. 8 ). Following the saturation of the FRP, the wrapping procedure was identical to thatfor System A. Complete details may be found in the nalreport [5].10. Bond tests For contact-critical applications there is a requirement for intimate contact but no specic requirement for adhe-sion of the FRP to the concrete substrate [9]. Nonetheless, on-site pullout tests were conducted to evaluate the FRP- concrete bond two years after the wrapping had been com- pleted. An Elcometer106 adhesion tester and a 3.7 cm(1.456 in.) diameter dolly was used to evaluate the FRP/concrete bond. Two System A wrapped piles 100-N *(car- bon) and 100-S*(glass), and one System B wrapped pile 101-N were selected. The tests were conducted on two facesper pile at two dierent levels - in the dry and the tidalregion. FRP witness panels created during the wrap on the east and west faces of the piles were used in the testing. Bondtests were carried out in accordance with established proce-dure. The FRP surface was scored using a 4.4 cm (1 3 4in:) diameter diamond core drill. The surfaces of the scored FRP were cleaned using coarse sand paper and dustremoved. Fast curing epoxy (Power-Fast+) manufacturedby Powers Fasteners, Inc. was used for bonding the dollies to the FRP. This took 15 min to dry and cured in 24 h. It can provide maximum bond strength of 20 MPa(3000 psi.). Table 4 andFig. 9 summarize the results of the pullout tests. The bond of FRP to the concrete substrate was foundto be poor. Most of the wet layup wrapped piles showedepoxy failures where the dolly separated from the concreteat its interface ( Fig. 10 ). All tests conducted on the pre-preg system were inter-layer failures ( Fig. 11 ) indicating that the bond between the FRP layers was poorer than its bond toconcrete. Inspection of Table 4 shows that the bond from System B performed better in the wet region while System A wasbetter for the dry region. Similar dierences were notobserved on laboratory specimens tested [6]. Therefore, the problem with bond can be attributed to the eld tech- niques used for wrapping. On-going research is developing a new protocol to prevent such inconsistency. Fig. 8.

Discussion This paper provides an overview of a demonstration project that explored the feasibility of using FRP to repair corroded reinforced piles in the tidal waters of Tampa Bay.In the study, two contrasting FRP systems were used andtwo dierent materials evaluated. Additionally, long termbond was also evaluated from on-site bond tests that wereconducted two years after the wrap had been applied. Of the two systems, the pre-preg was unquestionably the easier to use. The alternative wet layup system oeredgreater flexibility but required on-site saturation of theresin that requires much greater preparation. Though bondis not a requirement for contact-critical applications, theresults from the bond tests showed that the wet layup sys-tem performed better particularly in the partially wet andsubmerged regions. The water-activated pre-preg systemperformed better in the dry regions. While the demonstration project was for corrosion repair, the FRP system can be readily adapted for emer-gency repair. A combination of a boat and divers wouldallow the wrap to be easily conducted in both the dryand the submerged regions. However, a customized scaf-folding system may be better since it can eliminate uncer-tainty associated with underwater currents and changingweather conditions that can complicate the wrapping oper-ation. The light weight modular scaolding systems used in the demonstration project can be readily and inexpensively fabricated. They were assembled around the pile and con-veniently suspended from the pile cap. Its height wasadjusted so that the walk way was below the lowest wrap-ping depth. In a second demonstration study, steel chainsrather than angles were used to support the scaold fromthe pile cap since it was deemed to be more convenientfor the application [6]. The wrapping operation for the corrosion repairs was carried out at low tide. In case of emergency repairs, anadjustable scaolding system can be designed to accommo-date changing tides. Should repairs be carried out muchbelow the water line, divers would also be needed. The eco-nomics of wrapping will require contractors to devise Fig. 10.

The damage to the section needs to be repaired using low shrinkage materials compatible with concrete. Shouldthe section be reformed, appropriate inserts should be usedat the corners ( Fig. 6 ). This will greatly reduce the surface preparation work needed to round the edges since sharpcorners introduce stress concentrations that cannot betaken by thin FRP material. Estimate of material cost for wrapping the piles was pro- vided for both systems. This did not include the cost ofmobilization or installing the system. Costs expressed perlinear m (ft) of the 50 cm (20 in.) square piles ranged from$670/m ($204/ft) for glass to $885/m ($270/ft) for carbon. These costs compare favourably with alternative repair sys- tems [5,6]. 12. Conclusions The use of FRP for repairing partially submerged con- crete elements is relatively new. All applications reportedto date relate to corrosion repair. However, given the light- weight, high strength and corrosion resistance of the FRP it is just as suitable for conducting cost-eective emergencyrepairs. The procedures described in this paper that wereused for corrosion repair can be readily adapted for repairof piles damaged otherwise. Based on the experience gained from the demonstration studies, the following recommendations are made: 1. Speed is of essence in emergency repairs. All around access to piles needed for the wrapping operation is bestprovided by using scaolding systems that can be sus-pended from the pile cap. Should repairs be required sig-nicantly below the water line, divers may be needed forwrapping below the water line. If possible, operationsshould be scheduled for low tide. 2. The FRP wrap should be engineered to provide the required strength. Interaction diagrams need to bedeveloped to allow the combined eect of axial andbending capacity to be considered. The design shouldseek to keep the number of FRP layers to a minimum.For this reason, bi-directional material should be pre-ferred over uni-directional material and carbon overglass. 3. Both pre-pregs and on-site saturated FRP systems can be used. However, if repairs have to be carried out atvery short notice, on-site saturation systems may bethe more suitable. 4. If the section is to be re-formed, styrofoam or wood inserts with a curved prole should be placed in the cor-ners so that surface preparation work is minimized andoverall costs reduced.The methods described in the paper were rened and improved with each new application. This will undoubtedlybe the case for emergency repairs were similar improve-ments may be expected. The possibility of using FRPmay provide highway authorities with a cost-eective alter-native to conventional repair of damaged piles.

The goal of the research has been to develop an alternative cost effective FRP pile repair system. This paper provides a brief overview of the advances made in this direction with particular re ference to four completed projects and an on-going study. Introduction Fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) have been used for the repair and rehabilitation of highway structures as far back as 19771. In a majority of the applications, the FRP material was applied to dry surfaces under dry conditions. However, recent advances in resin technology have made it possible to use FRP for underwater repair. This has led to demonstration studies in which FRP was used to repair partially submerged piles in tidal waters 2. The lightweight, high strength and corrosion resistance of FRP offer obvious advantages for infrastructure repair. These advantages also apply to underwater repair where FRP may be expected to be equally effective in the fu ture. But this will require development of new techniques and equipment to simplify construction and expedite the repair process. USF has been exploring the application of FRP for corrosion repair for several years. Initially, laboratory studies were conducted to evaluate the role of FRP in corrosion repair 3,4 of piles in tidal waters. Subsequently, field demonstration projects were conducted at contrasting sites5-7. These locations were specially selected by the Florida Department of Transportation because of the aggressiveness of the environment. This was subsequently confirmed by chloride analysis of concrete cores taken from several repaired piles. In general, the chloride content at the level of the reinforcement exceeded the threshold required for corrosion initiation. The field demonstration projects undertaken may be conveniently classified as belonging to three distinct phases. In the first phase, completed in 2005, the focus was primarily on the feasibility of repairing partially submerged piles with FRP. The second phase, completed the following year, focused on improving the FRP- concrete bond by adapting vacuum bagging and pressure bagging techniques widely used by the composites industry. The third phase is on-going and is intended to develop an economical sacrificial cathodic protection system that can be integrated within the wrap. If the proposed system is proven to be effective, highway authorities will have access to a cost competitive alternative to available jacketing repair methods. Materials Two types of materials were used in all the repairs. One was a pre-preg, the other a wet lay up. The former uses a special, water-activated urethane resin. For this reason, the FRP material is cut to size, resin-saturated in the factory and shipped to the site in hermetically sealed pouches where it is opened just prior to the application. The wet lay up system is epoxy based and requires on-site impregnation. An additional wet lay up system was also used but this repair was carried out under dry conditions inside a cofferdam. For this reason, it is not discussed in here. Both carbon and fiberglass were used which resulted in similar corrosion rate reductions. Material properties of the fiber and resin as provided by the suppliers are summarized in Tables 1-2 8,9. Phase I - Technology Transfer The first phase commenced in late 2002 when preparations were made to conduct the first pile repair. The site for this demonstration was Allen Creek Bridge, Clearwater, FL (Fig. 1). Located on the busy US 19, it was selected primarily because it is in shallow, relatively calm waters. The remaining two studies conducted in this phase were on piles supporting Gandy Boulevard bridges spanning Tampa Bay, the largest estuary in Florida. The first of these two bridges is the Friendship Trails Bridge, now a recreational trail for pe destrians and cyclists. The second is the Gandy Bridge that is adjacent to the Friendship Trails Bridge. These bridges vary in age from 20 to 50 years old and consequently have different levels of distress. The oldest has over 90% of the 275 piers with either repairs or n eed of repairs. The newer, has less than 10% incidence of distressed piers. The waters of Tampa Bay in that area are deeper and more turbulent than those of Allen Creek Bridge and the site is 148COMPOSITES & POLYCON 2007 2 more representative of conditions where pile repairs are carried out in practice. No particular difficulties were associated with any of the repairs. In all cases, selected piles were instrumented to allow long term performance of the FRP wrap to be monitored. Detailed descriptions of these repairs are given elsewhere 5-7. The field application clearly demonstrated the feasibility of conducting repairs on corroding piles without the use of cofferdam construction. The main contributions from this phase were in three areas (1) instrumentation (2) design and (3) access systems. These are briefly described below: Instrumentation A new linear polarization based instrumentation system was developed which eliminated the need for wiring and junction boxes. The system used stainless steel rods that were embedded close to the pile surface on each face (Fig. 2). These rods served successively as the reference and counter electrodes in the linear polarization measurements. Because the rods had 90 degree protruding hooks at on e end, there was no need for wiring. Alligator clips could be used to make the necessary connections to the steel bars (reference and counter electrodes) and also to the working electrodes (steel reinforcement in concrete) as shown in Fig. 3. This system is inexpensive and can be used with available systems to monitor long term performance. Field measurements confirmed laboratory findings and showed that corrosion rates were lower in wrapped piles compared to unwrapped contro ls that were in a similar state of disrepair originally . Performance of carbon and glass were comparable. Design For an FRP system to be cost effective, it must be engineered so that factors of safety are consistent with those used in traditional engineering practice. Design determines the fiber architecture in the longitudinal (for strength) and transverse (for confinement) directions and the number of layers needed. A simple design method was developed in which the disparate requirements for strength and expansion were uncoupled. In essence, FRP was designed for strength from strain compatibility considerations using interaction diagrams (as in column design). The lateral expansion capacity of the strengthening provided was then checked to ensure that it could accommodate a lateral expansion set at 0.1%. Comparison with alternative design procedures showed that the proposed method was more economical and resulted in fewer FRP layers 10. Access All-around access to p iles is crucial during wrapping. In the first demonstration project in shallow waters, ladders were sufficient. But in all subsequent repairs conducted in the middle of Tampa Bay, access was provided by scaffolding. A lightweight, modular scaffolding system was designed that was assembled around the pile and suspended from the pile cap using angles or chains. The lightweight permitted the scaffolding to be readily moved between piles within a group (Fig. 4). Phase II - Improving FRP-Concrete Bond Laboratory studies have shown that the success of FRP in slowing down corrosion rates is contingent on the integrity of the FRP-concrete bond11-12. Where bond was intact, good performance is assured. Where bond was poor, there was evidence of localized corrosion. In-situ pullout tests were conducted in accordance with ASTM D4541 to assess the FRP-concrete bond in selected specimens that were repaired in Phase I. Fig. 5 shows results from the bond test. Inspection of Fig. 5 shows that the bond was variab le even though the same surface preparation and application method was used for the two systems. For the wa ter-activated resin system, bond was poorer in the wet (bottom) locations; for the epoxy systems it was poorer in the dry (top) regions. Usually, poor bond is attributed to improper surface preparation. But since surface preparation was not a factor, this variability is believed to be due to the adverse effect of self-weight of the saturated FRP in a vertical configuration. In this situation, the self weight of the wet wrap tends to make it pull away and/or slide down the pile surface. This is prevented by a plastic wrap that is wound tightly around the pile. The variability in the measured pullout resistance indicates that the effective pressure applied was not only variable (due to buoyancy and other effects) but also insufficient to generate adequate frictional resistance to counteract self- weight. To solve this problem, laboratory studies were undertaken using full-size pile specimens in which vacuum bagging and pressure bagging systems were evaluated 13. Both systems were made to work. However, vacuum bagging proved to be more problematic because of the difficulty in ensuring an airtight seal along the wrap boundary in cracked piles. Pressure bagging did not 149COMPOSITES & POLYCON 2007 3 pose a similar problem and was therefore selected for the field application. A prototype pressure bagging system was developed and was implemented in the most recent field trials that were completed in late 2006. In the application, two piles using the two different resin systems were wrapped. Fig. 6 shows a photograph of one of the repaired piles with the inflated pressure bag in place. The air pressure was kept at 14.5 kPa (300 psf). This was determined from the laboratory tests conducted. While no pullout tests have yet been carried out, results based on visual inspection and acoustic testing suggest that the FRP-concrete bond was excellent. Phase III - Incorporating Cathodic Protection The first two phases helped ensure that the quality of the FRP repair was consistent with that achievable in the laboratory. Nonetheless, as FRP serves simply as a barrier element it cannot stop electrochemical reactions caused by deleterious elements such as chlorides, moisture and oxygen present inside the wrap from continuing. Cathodic protection is the only proven method for stopping corrosion. A new study that was just funded will explore the possibility of integrating a sacrificial cathodic protection system within the FRP wrap. The study is in its preliminary phase but the design of the system is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Field implementation will be carried out the following year. The performance of the cathodic protection will be monitored over the next several months. Discussion Steady progress has been made in advancing the state-of-the-art for FRP un derwater pile repair. The demonstration projects completed to date have identified and solved several of the technical and logistic problems encountered or anticipated fo r the field wrap. These have been in these four areas : (1) instrumentation and monitoring (2) design (3) access and (4) new techniques for improving the underwater FRP-concrete bond. Progress to date clearly shows that FRP systems are viable and can be used for repairing piles in tidal waters. On-going research on a sacrificial cathodic protection system will further strengthen the case for using FRP. Conclusions The extension of FRP for the repair of corroding pile in tidal waters has proven to be simpler than was anticipated. After four demonstration projects, the major ingredients for successful t echnology transfer are in place: a design method that a llows an economical fiber layout to be selected; a pressure bagging system that ensures consistent bond between FRP and concrete; a modular scaffolding system that allows all-around access to piles. Other developments will allow steel to be cathodically protected thereby reducing the demand for the more expensive FRP material and extending the life of the repair. Based on our experience, it is clear that it is feasible to use FRP for underwater corrosion repair. The performance of the FRP in slowing down the corrosion rate appears to be comparable to that determined from laboratory testing. The repairs have held up well with the longest over four years at this time. Overall, the portents ar e promising and hopefully will culminate in the availability of a cost effective long-term or short-term solution for repairing piles that is acceptable to highway authorities worldwide.

C. Kranc Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of South Florida Tampa, Florida, USA kranc@eng.usf.edu Austin Gray Mullins Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering University of South Florida Tampa, Florida, USA gmullins@eng.usf.edu ABSTRACT Pilings cast with concrete in drilled shafts are prone to develop void regions during the pouring operation, compromising structural integrity. A technique for detecting pr oblem areas in the shaft shortly after the concrete has begun to set has been developed, based on temperature rise resulting from the hydration of cement. This paper is concerned with the development of an inverse modeling technique using measured temperature profiles along the shaft in an attempt to reconstruct the position and size of any suspected anomaly. The strategy adopted is to model the column, allowing for a possible void, and then minimizing error between the model and the observational data when the shape and position of the void are allowed to vary. Results for numerical experiments were successful but in practice the method is co mplicated by uncertain soil conditions, rate of heat generation, and boundary conditions at the site of the anomaly.

Alternatively, it is possible that a spontaneous void or pocket may develop during the process (Fig. 1). In either case, the concrete cover will be reduced or absent altoge ther, leaving the steel reinforcing cage exposed to accelerated corrosion, especially in salty soils. Ultimately, the structural strength of the column may be impaired, making repair of such conditions a high priority. Fig. 1: Illustration of drilled shaft piling.

REINFORCING STEEL CAGEPILELOGGING TUBE VOID EARTHPROBE 153Inverse Problems, Design and Optimization Symposium Miami, FL, U.S.A., April 16-18, 2007 A technique for detecting voids in the shaft shortly after the concrete has begun to harden has been developed [1]. The basis of this test procedure is the fact that the temperature of the pile increases for a period of time as a result of the hydration of the cement binder. Normally, within a sound column a relatively uniform, symmetric temperature profile develops, however in situations where a void occurs during construction, the local temperature in this region will be altered. After some time has elapsed information from this thermal disturbance will diffuse for some distance from the original void. This paper is concerned with the development of inverse modeling techniques utilizing measurements of temper ature distribution along the shaft in an attempt to recreate the position and size of any possible void. The ultimate goal of this approach is to recover information concerning both the size and position of possible voids, utilizing the logging measurements plus any additional information available. While any temperature anomaly detected is suspect, obtaining an improved image of the condition of the pile integrity would be quite valuable since it is possible that if a flaw is detected with sufficient spatial accuracy (and timeliness), remedial actions (such as concrete injection near a void) could be attempted. DETECTION OF VOIDS Small vertical logging tubes cast inside the concrete piling during construction make possible observations of the longitudinal temperature profiles at several locations by means of a probe fitted with infrared sensors and lowered into the tube, as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2. These measurements can be made at various times as the hydration reaction continues. Fig. 3 contains an example of the type of observations being made currently. In this particular instance, the pile was fitted with three logging tubes attached to the rebar cage at approximately 120\u00b0 intervals around the periphery. Bags of sand were attached to the cage (as shown in the figure) to simulate the type of concrete voids caused by cave-in, the situation of interest here. The shaft was 8.4 m in length and 1.2 m in diameter. Two small bags approximately 0.13 m deep, 0.46 m high and 0.9 m long were centered at about 80\u00ba and 120\u00ba from tube, at the depth shown in the figure. The lower bag was twice that size and centered on the tube. A thermal disturbance due to the sandbag was easily detected, and the approximate position can be estimated both vertically and in relation to the logging tubes around the circumference. Experiments are difficult (due to environmental conditions) and expensive to conduct. Fig. 2: Illustrating the probe with four thermocouple sensors inserted in logging tube. Fig. 3: Data obtained from typical experiment at 14 hours. Temperature data is normalized to the ambient conditions at start of test. Although preliminary, these measurements clearly indicate the presen ce of a void and provide an indication of approximate location. Anticipating improvement in signal quality with further experience, the purpose of the investigation presented here is to determine whether inverse modeling techniques can be INFRARED THERMOCOUPLES LOGGING TUBE CONCRETEOBSERVATION DIRECTIONS PROBE -1.00-0.75-0.50-0.250.00 1.00 1.05 1.10 1.15 1.20 1.254 23112 34PILE LOGGING TUBE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF VOIDS RELATIVE TEMPERATURE - T/TAMBVERTICAL POSITION - Z/Z0 LARGESMALL -1.00-0.75-0.50-0.250.00 1.00 1.05 1.254 23112 34PILE LOGGING TUBE 12 34PILE LOGGING TUBE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF VOIDS RELATIVE TEMPERATURE - T/TAMBVERTICAL POSITION - Z/Z0 LARGESMALL 154Inverse Problems, Design and Optimization Symposium Miami, FL, U.S.A., April 16-18, 2007 utilized to refine estimates of the position and size of any suspected voids. It is noted that others have made similar temperature measurements [2] and have reported apparent anomalies, believed to be due to outward bulging of the column wall. THERMAL BEHAVIOR NEAR VOID Numerical experiments were conducted utilizing simulated data, since no reliable experimental data is currently available. Data sets were synthesized by modeling of the column at various times during the hydration period to obtain temperature profiles in the logging tubes. Beginning with the conventional time-dependent heat transfer equation, including heat generation, in cylindrical coordinates (Eq. 1), a finite difference model for the temperature, T, was constructed for a cylindrical section of the column, kq zT T rrT r rT tT * 1 1 1 22 22 2 22 ++++= (1) where k is the thermal conductivity and q* is the volumetric rate of heat generation. The following assumptions were made: 1. The dimensions of the column section were R 0=.65 m, L 0= 1 m. 2. The thermal diffusivity, , of concrete was taken to be 4.18x10-7 m2/s. 3. An insulated boundary at the cylinder ends (away from any disturbance) was imposed. 4. The generation term, q*/k, was given as a function of time (Fig. 4). 5. Two logging tubes were located at 90\u00b0 intervals (Fig. 5). Fig. 4: Heat generation function employed for simulated data and numerical experiments. Fig. 5: Test configuration and region of computations for work reported here. Synthesized data were calculated at 18 hours from the beginning of pouring. The probe is currently constructed to permit observation of temperature in four directions and (if stabilized against rotation in the tube) can be oriented so that observations are made in the radial and azimuthal directions (Fig. 3). Because the computational grid is relatively coarse (14x18x20 nodes), conditions at the logging tubes were constructed numerically in the following manner. In each of the four directions a three point estimate of the derivative was constructed for the point half way between the node representing the tube center and the next node outward (Fig. 6). Fig. 6: Computational grid in vicinity of logging tube showing the extra point (labeled 0) used to calculate the temperature along the tube facing one direction.

The quadrant modeled included three sets of nodes beyond the logging tubes to permit this computation (Fig. 5). At each time step the node at the center of the tube was replaced with the average of the wall temperatures. A test void (0.2 m deep x 0.17 m high x 0.17 m wide) was utilized for numerical experiments. The cylindrical test section containing the void is depicted in Fig. 7. Fig. 7: Representation of the surface of the column section for trial data set. Depth of void is 0.7 R 0. Logging tubes shown for clarity. Fig. 8: Calculated temperature profiles at logging tubes at 18 hours, used for trial data. Inset indicates probe measurement directions; dashed lines indicate logging tube most distant from void. Fig. 8 contains the temperature profiles that would be measured by a probe, obtained by direct computation of the temperature distribution for the column shown in Fig. 7 (employing the assumed hydration function). While the signal observed at the logging tube nearest the void is substantial, the other tube shows a very limited temperature change. These results (functions of time and depth) were utilizing as trial data for the inverse modeling strategies examined here. To remove the dependence on grid spacing, results for the wall temperatures in the logging tubes were interpolated by a cubic spline at desired locations to simulate a hypothetical data set. INVERSE METHODS Two inverse strategies for recovering the position and size of the void were investigated. The first of these, intended to utilize the data to identify just the azimuthal position of a suspected void, was developed as follows. A two- dimensional (r, ) finite difference, time dependent heat transfer model (with heat generation) was constructed for a concrete disk, in a manner similar to that used to produce the original data (but with different grid spacing). Again, the outer surface of the concrete was assumed to be at ground temperature, T amb. This model was formulated as a function of a nine element vector which determined the extent of the void. Fig. 9: Region of interest within the computational grid. The radial position held at T amb forms a nine vector composed of integer elements. In the example shown all circled nodes are set to T amb.

The vector represented the integer values of the nodes forming the radial position of the void or if not part of the void, the outer surface. The nodes in the region of interest and thus affected by the value of the nine vector were centered near the position of the suspected void. This model was then used as an objective function, in a scheme which attempted to minimize the square error (at the time of observation) between the model results and the observed temperature at the logging tube when the shape and position of the void are allowed to vary. The MATLAB \u00a9 constrained optimization function ( fmincon ) was employed to minimize the least square error between the model output and the simulated data set while varying the nine vector parameter. Since this routine does not handle integer parameters, the nine-vector was developed as a fraction of the radius, multiplied by the number of radial elements and rounded to an integer within the objective function. The step size in the minimization routine was set to be consistent with integer intervals. The results of a numerical experiment utilizing the two-dimensional model are shown in Fig. 10. Fig. 10: Void location and depth recovered from trial data by two dimensional inverse method. The computed void appears to match the actual conditions reasonably well but the shape is somewhat broadened. This method indicates the approximate location of the center of the void and moving the midpoint of the nine-vector gave similar results, although not necessarily as close a match. The use of one more step in time forward or back gave little change, nor did utilizing data from several time steps simultaneously. It should be noted that in practice it is not always feasible to wait for more extensive tests if repairs are to be made. The second strategy consisted of an attempt to reconstruct the void position and volume using a three-dimensional model. This model was formulated much like the first but as a function of a 5X5 array, which was again used to determine which nodes were set to T amb. In this case however a more realistic image of a void is obtained (as can be seen in Fig. 11), since the vertical variation in logging tube data is additionally utilized to produce a three dimensional image. An initial guess concerning the location of the void center can be obtained from the first method and the vertical characteristics of the data. The location of the void has been determined reasonably well. For comparative purposes, the volume of the computed void is about 1.5 times that of the original. Fig. 11: Representation of the cylindrical section of the pile containing the void as reconstructed by the three-dimensional modeling technique. CONCUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS Two inverse techniques for spatially resolving voids in drilled shaft concrete piles have been developed and successfuly tested with synthesized data, representing temperature information available from inside the shaft. It is expected that these concepts can eventually be used.

At present the analysis relys on several ad hoc assumptions regarding the ambient temperature and conditions at the wall. Eventually it may be possible to use data from regions without voids to deduce these conditions as well as the rate of heat generation, also by inverse techniques. REFERENCES 1. A. G. Mullins and S.

Burden Faires 158Roof Damage in New Homes Caused by Hurricane Charley Nick Meloy1; Rajan Sen, F .ASCE2; Niranjan Pai3; and Gray Mullins, M.ASCE4 Abstract: Hurricane Charley was the rst Category 4 hurricane to strike Florida after 1992. This paper presents results of a study to investigate the performance of 425 of 747 roofs of new homes in Punta Gorda Isles, a subdivision of Punta Gorda that was directly in the path of Hurricane Charley shortly after it made landfall. The homes examined were larger, concrete/clay tiled roof homes having irregularfloor plans and complex roof congurations not explicitly addressed by prevailing wind load codes. Roof damage was evaluated usingimages from aerial photographs taken at an elevation of approximately 762 m /H208492,500 ft. /H20850Specialized software was used to quantify damage. Damage was classied based on tile loss area. The study showed that the vast majority of the roofs were either undamaged orsustained minor damage. Fewer than 14% were classied as damaged. The most common observed tile loss was along ridges, corners, orin the hip zone where negative uplift pressures are recognized to be the highest. Given the modest observed damage, prevailing methodsfor estimating wind loads for irregular buildings specied in codes may be adequate. Problems encountered may be best resolved throughnew details for attaching tiles on ridges, corners, and hip zone.

Introduction The 2004 hurricane season was devastating for Florida. For the rst time in 153 years of record keeping, the state was struck byfour hurricanes. Of these, the rst, Hurricane Charley, a Category4 storm was the most severe and caused the most destruction.Charley made landfall in the barrier islands in Lee County, Fla.,on August 13, 2004 causing 33 deaths and an estimated $14billion of insured loss. This made it the second costliest hurricanein the state since Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida in 1992/H20849National Climatic Data Center 2005 /H20850. Unlike buildings with steep roof slopes characteristic of cold regions, buildings with moderate roof slopes common in thesoutheast, are subjected to large uplift forces. These uplift forces can cause the lightweight roofs to sustain signicant damage un-less they are properly engineered. Indeed, 90% of all homes in thepath of Hurricane Andrew experienced roof damage with 33%sustaining severe damage. Typical damage resulting from theseforces include separation of roof components, buckling of rooftrusses, pullout of anchorage and collapse of structural support /H20849Bradford and Sen 2004/H20850. The problems identied by damage caused by Hurricane An- drew in 1992 /H20849Cook and Soltani 1994/H20850 led to changes in code requirements to rectify shortfalls in design, detailing, and inspec-tion. In 1993, the Standard Building Code /H20849SBC/H20850 issued a deemed to comply publication \"Standard for Hurricane Resistant Residen-tial Construction /H20849SSTD 10/H20850\" also referred to as SSTD 10 /H20849SBC 1993/H20850. This was subsequently updated in 1999 /H20849SBC 1999/H20850. SSTD 10 provides a prescriptive method for building one-, two-,and three-story residential buildings to withstand high winds. In 1998, the Florida legislature passed a law to create a new statewide code that replaced the 470 local codes that were inforce. This new code published in 2001 was adopted in 2002/H20849Florida Building Code 2001/H20850. It is modeled after the 1999 SBC code and the South Florida code and retained many of its provi-sions /H20849FEMA 2005/H20850. The damage caused by Hurricane Andrew was also repeated by Hurricane Charley in older homes designed and built to pre-Andrew codes. For example, Charley damaged 11,615 homes inCharlotte County /H20849St. Petersburg Times 2005/H20850. These failures were due to well documented deciencies rectied in the newercodes and are therefore outside the scope of this paper. Objectives and Scope The aim of the study was to evaluate the performance of roof coverings of newer homes in Punta Gorda Isles /H20849PGI/H20850, a subdivi- sion post-Andrew codes that were sub-jected to Charley's strongest sustained winds. For this reason,homes were limited to those built in the past ten years. Thisallowed the performance of the newer SSTD 10 and the FloridaBuilding Code to be assessed. As all homes in PGI were requiredto have concrete or clay tiled roofs /H20849this ordinance was changed1Project Engineer, Universal Engineering Sciences, Orlando, FL 32811; formerly, Undergraduate Student, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL, 33620. 2Professor, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620. 3Research Associate, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620. 4Associate Professor, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620.

An equally important objective was to evaluate the perfor- mance of homes with irregular floor plans and complex roofcongurations since these are outside the scope of prevailing stan-dards /H20849Stathopoulos 2003/H20850. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the roof types covered in the prevailing standards are flat roof with parapet wall,gable roof, hip roof, and monoslope roof with overall rectangularlayouts. Most modern homes have a combination of gable and hiproofs on nonrectangular layouts. Path of Hurricane Charley Fig. 2 shows the path of Hurricane Charley as it made landfall inFlorida. This fast moving, intense, narrow /H20851hurricane force winds extended approximately 11.3 km /H208497m i /H20850from the center/H20852 rst made landfall in Cayo Costa, Fla. Subsequently it crossed Char-lotte Harbor moving inland rst towards Punta Gorda, then PortCharlotte, and Arcadia. The highest wind speeds were not mea-sured. However, model-based assessment of Charley's maximumwind speeds estimated it to be between 201.2 and 225.3 km/h/H20849125 and 140 mi/hr/H20850/H20849 for downtown Punta B, 3-second peak gust/H20850. The corresponding maximum speed forExposure C was estimated to be between 225.3 and 257.5 km/h/H20849140 and 160 mi/h /H20850. These speeds the design speed of 183.5 to 209.2 km/h /H20849114 to Site PGI, a new subdivision of Punta Gorda, was selected for thesurvey as it met all the requirements for this study. As it wasdirectly in the path of Hurricane Charley shortly after it madelandfall, all buildings in the subdivision were subjected to thestrongest sustained winds. Equally importantly, it had a signi-cant number of homes built to new codes. These homes were alllarge /H20851325 m 2/H208493,500 ft2/H20850average/H20852 having irregular floor plans and complex roofs. PGI was also a deed restricted communitythat required all homes to have tiled roofs. Development of PGI started in 1957 and different areas were opened over the years. There are 18,794 parcels in PGI of which17,598 have been built upon. PGI has 747 homes built from 1996to 2003. Of these, 425 were evaluated in this study /H2084957%/H20850. With the exception of a few homes located on a golf course, all homesin PGI are on wide canals with access to Charlotte Harbor and theGulf of Mexico /H20849The Andreae Group 1997-2003/H20850. Approach A systematic study was conducted in which post-Charley aerialphotographs of 425 of the 747 new homes constructed in PGIwere reviewed. Aerial photographs were obtained from Pictom-etry International Corp. /H20849Rochester, N.Y ./H20850, who photographed the storm-affected areas shortly after Hurricane Charley movedthrough the area. Most images were taken on August 21, 2004, with a small portion taken between August 27 and 28, 2004. All images werehigh resolution /H2085112.2 cm /H208490.4 ft/H20850 per pixel/H20852 and in digital format. Special software provided by Pictometry allowed buildings to beidentied by their address. With information provided by theCharlotte County Geographical Information Systems Department/H20849Charlotte County, Florida 1997-2004/H20850 and the Charlotte County Property Appraiser /H20849Charlotte County Property Appraiser 1997- 2004/H20850, buildings could be identied very efciently. Other providers of aerial photography were also considered. These included Keyhole, Applied Geotechnologies, M7 Visual In-telligence, and Digital Globe. Pictometry was chosen for theircoverage of the area of interest after the storm, their willingnessto assist in this research, and the quality of their product includingpictures and software. Additionally, site visits were made to the homes classied as \"damaged\" /H20849see the section entitled \"Damage Classication\" for further explanation/H20850. The purpose of the site visit was to attemptto verify the mode of damage seen in aerial photographs. Detailssuch as contractor and attachment method were also included in Fig. 1.

Unfortunately not all of the homeowners were avail- able during site visits and several of the homes had been repairedor were under repair. Therefore, tile material type and contractorinformation could not be quantied. Aerial Photographs Traditionally aerial images are taken orthogonally or straight down. Pictometry markets a unique product in that they provideimages taken at an angle. These oblique images were used in thisstudy so that features could be easily seen in their entirety. Allaerial images used in the study were supplied by PictometryInternational. Oblique pictures /H20849at an angle of 40-45\u00b0 /H20850were taken from different directions at two elevations for the neighborhood /H20851ap- proximately 762 m /H208495,000-6,000 ft/H20850 /H20852. This made it possible to view and analyze any house or building feature in PGI from all cardinaldirections /H20851see Figs. 3/H20849a-d/H20850/H20852. Having four views of each property provided a more complete image of the damage, although detailssuch as tile material /H20849i.e., concrete or clay/H20850 or tile pattern could not be denitively identied from the photographs.Pictometry has a unique patented information system that combines aerial imaging with a state of the art software system that includes tools useful in analysis of aerial images called Elec-tronic Field Study /H20849EFS/H20850/H20849 Pictometry International 2002/H20850. Dis- tances, heights, and areas can all be estimated using this software. Quantication of Damage EFS permits areas to be measured simply by drawing a line around the target region with an \"area tool.\" The program thencalculates the enclosed area /H20849Fig. 4/H20850. Other tools allow dimen- sions to be estimated, e.g., roof height or photographs to be an-notated to show the wind direction. The specic area tool used for this research did not take the pitch of the roof into consideration, and as such, the measure-ments obtained had a range of accuracy. The accuracy could beimproved by using newer EFS tools that allow the user to take theroof pitch into account or by incorporating better elevation mod-els. Regardless of which tool is used, the nal measurement ac-curacy is affected by how accurately the user draws the height Fig. 3. Example neighborhood oblique image. Four views allow for damage on all sides to be clearly seen and estimated: /H20849a/H20850south; /H20849b/H20850north; /H20849c/H20850west; and /H20849d/H20850east views of a damaged house /H20849Reprinted with permission, Pictometry International Corp. 2006 /H20850.

Nonetheless, since the same method was used for all the buildings, it provides valuablecomparative data. Damage Classication Property data were plotted using mapping software to give a vi-sual representation of the location of homes relative to the path ofHurricane Charley /H20849Fig. 5/H20850. Homes were chosen randomly from this plot and analyzed in EFS. Four views, one from each cardinaldirection /H20849Fig. 3/H20850, of each home were saved and the estimated area of missing tiles was recorded in a database along with prop-erty information. Damage Home A home designated as damaged would have large areas of missing tiles or at least 9.29 m 2/H20849100 ft2/H20850of missing tile. See Fig. 6.Minor Damage If the area of missing tiles was between 0.46 and 9.29 m2/H208495 and 100 ft2/H20850or there were no large areas of missing tiles damage was classied as minor. See Fig. 7. No Damage A home with less than 0.46 m2/H208495f t2/H20850of missing tiles was con- sidered to have no damage. See Fig. 8. Location of Homes After property damage had been categorized based on measured damage from the aerial photographs, markers identifying thelocation of these properties were placed on a map of PGI /H20849see Fig. 5/H20850.

It may be seen that damaged homes are concentrated in thesouthern and western part of PGI, whereas the others are moreevenly distributed over the region. A complete photographicrecord of damaged homes compiled in this study is included inthe nal report /H20849Meloy et al. 2005/H20850. Analysis of Data Table 1 provides a year-wise breakdown of the 425 homes studiedwhich accounts for 57% of the 747 homes built in Punta GordaIsles from 1996 to 2003. In numerical terms, the largest numberof homes were those built in 2000 /H2084976/H20850, whereas the fewest was for 2003 /H2084931/H20850. Table 1 also shows that the sample size relative to the number of houses built was over 50% for homes built in 1996/H2084952%/H20850 and 1997 /H2084951%/H20850 and in the mid-40% range for the remain- ing years. From the data presented in Table 1, it may be seen that, in terms of average damage per home, the least damage was inhomes built in 1996 /H208511.8 m m2/H2084934.2 ft2/H20850/H20852. The greatest was for homes built 1999 /H208517.8 m2/H2084983.5 ft2/H20850/H20852and in 2003 /H2085113.9 m2/H20849149.2 ft2/H20850/H20852. The damage for 2003 included two houses that contributed 58.7% of the total damage for that year. Thesetwo homes did not have any attribute, such as geographic positionor floorplan, which could explain the large amount of damage.Poor construction is the most probable reason for these outliers. Ifthese two houses are omitted, the average damage for homes builtin 2003 is much smaller /H208496.1 m 2or 65.9 ft2/H20850. Fig. 8.

Of the 425 homes studied, the roofs of 210 /H2084949%/H20850 suf- fered no damage, whereas 158 others /H2084937%/H20850 had minor damage. This means that only a small fraction of the homes /H2084914%/H20850 were classied as damaged. Given the large sample size, it is reason- able to conclude for tiled roofs used in these large homes currentmethods for calculating design wind speeds for irregular roofs areadequate. Table 3 compares the relative performance of homes built to the Standard Building Code and the Florida Building Code. Basedon the measured tile loss, the overall performance of the buildingsdesigned to the SBC /H208491996-2001/H20850 or the Florida Building Code /H208492002-2003/H20850 are quite comparable.

Table 4 provides data on the relationship between damage and year of construction. As noted earlier, overall only 14% of the 425homes were damaged. However, homes built in 1997 /H2084920%/H20850, 1999 /H2084921%/H20850, and 2003 /H2084926%/H20850 suffered greater damage while those built in 1996 or 1998 /H20849both 5%/H20850 suffered the least damage. In terms of undamaged homes, homes built in 1996 /H2084957%/H20850, 2001 /H2084956%/H20850, and 2003 /H2084958%/H20850 fared the best. It is interesting to note that homes built in 2003 have the largest percentage of undamaged homesand also the largest percentage of damaged homes. Only 16% ofhomes built in 2003 had minor damage compared to a range of32-45% for the other years. The exact cause of the large disparityin behavior of homes built in 2003 is not clear, but it may be dueto combination of the relatively small sample size and some casesof poor construction and unfavorable location. Table 5 provides a year-wise breakdown of the damage to the roof in the cardinal directions. With the exception of homes builtTable 5.

Homes suffered the greatest damage on the east side possibly indicating damage was done by debris. Winds were initially from theeast. Assuming most damage was done by the rst and strongestwinds, this may show that much of the damage was caused by debrisas tiles are more commonly lost on the negative pressure ordownwind side. Airborne debris would be traveling westward andimpacting homes on the east side. Fig. 13.

This isevident from the cumulative damage listed in the last line of thetable that is also plotted in Fig. 12. This is to be expected as initialwinds were from the east and would have been the strongest. Damage Characterization As in previous surveys of damage caused by other hurricanes,such as Andrew /H20849Cook and Sotani 1994/H20850 and Hugo /H20849Sell and Sparks 1991/H20850 there was damage due to poor workmanship and due to windborne debris. This needs to be separated in order toevaluate the role of high winds on the performance of new roofconstruction. Damage due to Poor Construction The Florida Roong, Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contrac- tors Association have developed consensus standards /H20849updated or reafrmed every three years/H20850 for the installation of concrete and clay roof tiles. Several alternate approved systems for installingtiles are permitted, e.g., using mechanical fasteners, mortar set, oradhesive. Roof damage observed in the eld region of the roof, i.e., excluding the high suction regions such as corners, perimeter orridges, could be due to improper attachment of the tiles. An ex-ample of such damage is shown in Fig. 13/H20849a/H20850 where the mortar-set attachment method was used. Here the damage extends to theeld region beyond the ridge. The mortar-set installation wasidentied as more susceptible to damage by the Federal Emer-gency Management Association /H20849FEMA 2004/H20850. There was also widespread damage to building softs /H20849vents under the roof over- hang that allow the attic to breathe/H20850 because it had not been prop- erly attached /H20851see Fig. 14/H20849a/H20850/H20852. Damage due to Flying Debris The new codes require houses built in close proximity to the coast to protect openings by providing damage resistant glass or pro-tective shutters. However, tile roofs are vulnerable to damage byflying debris. This type of damage was reported by home ownerswho responded to the contact letter sent out by the University ofSouth Florida /H20849USF/H20850 or in discussions with the USF research team during site visits. An example of such roof damage provided by ahomeowner is shown in Fig. 14/H20849b/H20850. Such impact damage was distinguished by remnants of smashed tiles/shingles that were leftbehind. Damage due to Wind Five examples of characteristic damage due to high wind are shown in Figs. 15-19. In each case, the area surrounding thedamaged home is shown along with information on the year thehouse was built and nearby homes to provide a measure of thedamage sustained in the neighborhood. Figs. 15-19 were spe-cially selected because neighboring homes sustained little dam-age. Tile loss cannot therefore be attributed to flying debris butdue to the intensity of the wind and its interaction with the build-ing. The direction of the prevailing wind is also shown in somecases. This of course reverses as the eye of the hurricane crossesa region. Inspection of these photos shows that damage was typically Fig. 14. /H20849a/H20850Roof damage due to impact near gutter note damage to soft; /H20849b/H20850tile damage due to windborne debris /H20849Courtesy of homeowner/H20850 Fig. 15.

These occurred at locations of high suction forces that are well recognized by codes though in this case sustained winds exceeded the basic designwind speed for Punta Gorda /H20849ASCE 2003/H20850. It may be seen that all ve homes in Figs. 15-19 have complex roof congurations that are not strictly catered to by codes. None-theless, a large number of homes in the neighborhood of the dam-aged home sustained no damage /H20849see Figs. 15-17 and 19/H20850. This could be related to local variation in wind velocity, its directionrelative to the house or the method by which the tiles wereattached. Fig. 20/H20849a/H20850 shows a close-up view of damage to ridge tiles provided by a home owner. Fig. 20 /H20849b/H20850shows a photo of similar damage taken by the research team. As with Figs. 15-19, damagewas in the zone of high negative pressure. The absence of evi-dence of flying debris from neighboring houses clearly indicatesthat damage was due to the intensity of the wind and its interac-tion with the structure, not poor workmanship as was the case inFig. 16. Discussion This paper provides a brief overview of the type of damage oc-curring in an upscale neighborhood consisting of large, expensive,waterfront homes that bore the brunt of Hurricane Charley. 57%of all homes built in PGI from 1996 to 2003 were examined in thestudy but damage was found to be limited even in houses thatwere located close to the eye of the hurricane. This was mostprobably because the hurricane was compact and the entire PGIregion was subjected to similar sustained winds that were esti-mated to be above the design wind speed. This excellent performance of the new homes indicates that current specications for the type of buildings examined /H20849irregu- lar with clay or concrete tiled roofs /H20850are generally adequate. Wind damage was sustained along ridges, corners, in the hip zone, andeaves regions that are known to be subject to high suction forces.Given that the roofs of a majority of homes were undamaged,there is no compelling reason for making any signicant changes.However, specications for attaching tiles along ridges, hip zonesshould be tightened to ensure that damage observed is not en-countered under a similar wind event in the future. These ndings may be relevant for the entire northeastern United States that can also be subject to hurricane force winds.Over the last 30 years, the average U.S. home has signicantlyincreased by 40% from 154 m ft2in 2003 /H20849U.S. Census Bureau 2003/H20850. Larger homes are characterized by irregular floor and complex roof congurations.The homes examined in this project were much larger/H20851325 m 2/H208493,500 ft2/H20850/H20852with more complex roof congurations and the good performance observed in this study will be reassuring tothose living in these new homes. Summary and Conclusions This paper presents an analysis of the roof damage in newer,larger, irregular homes caused by Hurricane Charley. The site forthe study was Punta Gorda Isles, a new subdivision of PuntaGorda and only homes built from 1996 to 2003 were examined.Aerial photographs were used for the study and damage was Fig. 19.

Homes were characterized as damaged, undamaged or moderately damaged based on area oftile loss /H20849see Figs. 6-8/H20850. From the ndings presented, the follow- ing conclusions may be drawn.1. Despite being subjected to winds in excess of the design speed, there was relatively little roof damage in terms ofmissing tiles. Of the 425 homes examined, there was no roofdamage in 210 homes /H2084949%/H20850. There was minor damage in 158 homes /H2084937%/H20850. Only 57 homes /H2084914%/H20850 sustained signi- cant damage. This suggests that existing code methods forcalculating wind pressures in irregular structures or deemedto satisfy details for one- and two-story buildings in the Stan-dard Building Code and Florida Building Code are adequate/H20849see Table 2/H20850. 2. The buildings that sustained damage were located in the southern and western sides of Punta Gorda Isles /H20849Fig. 9/H20850. Homes that were undamaged or moderately damaged weredistributed more evenly /H20849Figs. 10 and 11/H20850. 3. There was some evidence of damage due to poor tile instal- lation. Impact from windborne debris also caused damage insome cases. Site visits revealed that in many cases wind-borne debris consisted of roof tiles from neighboring homes/H20851Fig. 14/H20849b/H20850/H20852. 4. Damage was nearly twice as much on the eastern side of buildings compared to other sides /H20849Table 5 and Fig. 12/H20850. This can be expected as primary sustained winds came from theeast in the rst part of the storm. These winds would havebeen stronger than the west winds produced as the stormpassed over land and weakened. Also homes in disrepair orinsufciently secured roof tiles can be expected to have losttiles during the rst part of the storm. Any airborne debriswould be traveling westward and impacting buildings on theeastern side. 5. Proximity to the eye of the hurricane did not necessarily result in greater damage. 6. Wind damage was concentrated to corners, ridges, hip zones, and eaves where negative pressures can be highest. It is pos-sible that wind pressure coefcients in the complex roofsexamined in these locations were underestimated. This prob-lem can be most readily rectied by strengthening require-ments for fastening tiles in these locations and ensuring thatthese measures are enforced through rigorous inspection. It should be noted that all buildings in PGI were deed restricted tohave tiled roofs. Therefore, these conclusions are valid for homeswith concrete or clay tiled roofs.

Abstract: (12 pt. Bold underscore) The availability of resins that can cure in water has made it possible to explore the use of FRP for the corrosion repair of piles. Over the past three years, USF has co mpleted four such demonstration projects. Three of these were conduc ted in the tidal waters of Tamp a Bay, Florida's largest estuary connecting Tampa Bay to the Gulf of Mexico. In each case selected piles were instrumented to allow long term monitoring of FRP's perf ormance in mitigating corrosion. Th is paper presents an overview on the lessons learnt and future developments planne d with particular reference to the completed field demonstration projects. 3rd COBRAE Conference, Benefits of Composites in Civil Engineering, University of Stuttgart, March 28-30 1701. INTRODUCTION Fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) have been used for the repair and retrofit of concrete structural elements for over two decades. Their lightweight, high strength and resistance to chemicals offer obvious advantages. In fabric form, they provide unpr ecedented flexibility since fibers can be oriented to provide strength in any desired direction. More recently, FRP has also been used for corrosion repair. This application is somewhat controversial because of uncertainty regardi ng the consequences of continuing corrosion inside the wrap. Nonetheless, several demonstration projects have been completed though the majority of such repairs were carried out in dry conditions 1. Underwater FRP repair became a possibility following th e availability of resins that can cure under wet conditions. This paper provides an overview of the pr ogress made over the last four years in exploring the use of FRP for repairing corrodi ng piles in Florida's tidal waters. 2. BACKGROUND Among contiguous states in the United States, Florid a has the longest coast line. Its sub-tropical climate, combined with the high salinity characteristic of Atlantic waters in the 20-30 o latitude has made concrete piles in marine environments very susceptible to corrosion. The process starts by ingress of chlorides through the c oncrete cover that result in the de struction of the protective passive oxide film on the steel surface. Oxygen from the ai r or dissolved oxygen from the water coupled with moisture present in the concrete then oxidizes the steel leading to the formation of rust that occupies a much greater volume than the original steel. The resu lting tensile stresses cause cracking and spalling that are symptomatic of corrosion damage. Minor corrosion repairs are carried out using 'chip and patch' repair techniques. Greater damage is commonly repaired by encapsulating the corroded area in the \"splash zone\" (a region subjected to wet- dry tidal cycles) in a jacket (Fig. 1), usually made of fiberglass because of its light weight. The jacket does not contribute to the repair strength but merely serves as a stay-i n-place form for the concrete that is poured in the annular space between the pile and th e inside surface of the jacket. Since the fiberglass jacket is opaque the repaired region is hidden maki ng it impossible for inspector s to assess its state of repair unless corrosion has progressed to the extent that external rust st ains become visible. Fig. 1. View of jacketed piles (lef t) and view of underlyi ng corrosion with the j acket removed (right) 3rd COBRAE Conference, Benefits of Composites in Civil Engineering, University of Stuttgart, March 28-30 171As a general principle, repairs ar e only durable if the conditions res ponsible for the original damage are removed. For corrosion damage, this requires rem oval of all the chloride -contaminated concrete and its replacement by sound concrete. This is a daunting task even when the repair is carried out under dry conditions. For piles that are half-submerged in salt water, the cost of such preparation is prohibitive. As a result, pile repair s are not durable unless they are used in combination with a cathodic protection system. Otherwise, it is only a matter of time before the repaired region corrodes again. Fig. 1 shows the state of corrosion in a pile revealed by removing the pile jacket. Such recurring damage makes repairs costly over the lifetime of the structure. It should be noted that as FRPs are simply barri er elements they cannot stop the electro-chemical reactions responsible for corrosion. However, if th e FRP system can be optimized, repairs may prove more durable and thereby offer a cost effective altern ative to highway authoritie s. This is one of the motivating factors for continued research and development on this application. 3. ISSUES RELATING TO UNDERWATER FRP REPAIR The critical issues relating to underwater FRP repair are in many respects similar to those for repairs carried out under dry conditions. For example, it re quires the same attention to surface preparation, material placement and cure. It is therefore not unr easonable to expect underwat er FRP repair to enjoy similar dominance in the repair market if overall costs are lower and the repair more durable than current jacketing methods (Fig. 1). Some of the issues relating to underwater repair are addressed briefly below: Surface Preparation - as FRP pile repairs are part contact-critical (to withstand expansion due to corrosion) and part bond-critical (t o allow flexural strengthening), su rface preparation is crucially important. Unlike repairs above ground, pile repair nece ssitates removal of marine growth that forms at the water line (Fig. 2). This is best removed by using air-driven needle scalers, grinders or simply by chipping. Following removal of this growth, the su rface needs to be cleaned and made smooth again. High pressure washing using fresh water is the most effective technique for cleaning. ACI's Guide to Underwater Repair 2 recommends a pressure of 68.5 MPa (10,000 ps i) with a standoff distance of 10 to 80 mm (0.5 to 3 in.) and an impingement angle of 40-90o for best results. With a flow rate of 100L/min (26 gal/min), cleaning rates of 0.35 to 0.65 m2/min (4 to 7 ft2/min) are attainable. Cleaning Corroded Steel - the International Concrete Repair Institute provides guidelines for the repair of deteriorated co ncrete resulting from stee l corrosion (Guideline No. 03730 3). This requires undercutting of all exposed corroded bars to provide access for under bar cleaning of the full circumference of the bar. Additionally, delaminate d concrete must be removed to provide minimum thickness for the repair material. At edge locations, right angle cuts are required so that there is no 'feather edge', i.e. the depth of the cut is not redu ced at the edges. However, in most demonstration projects reported in the literature1 no particular attempt was made to comply with these guidelines because of the cost and potential danger to the stru cture. Instead, the wrap was designed to account for a greater steel loss. Access to Piles - the success of the repair requires easy access to the en tire region to be wrapped. Cofferdam construction (Fig. 3) permits ready access; however, it is likely to be costly. Customized scaffolding systems offer a cost effective solution a nd were used in the demonstration projects in deep waters. In essence it consists of a lightweight horizontal platform constructed of two expanded steel mesh sections that can be bolted in place around the piles. The assembly can be suspended from the pile cap by steel angles or chains. 3rd COBRAE Conference, Benefits of Composites in Civil Engineering, University of Stuttgart, March 28-30 172 Fig. 2. Marine growth Fig. 3. Coffer dam construction Environmental conditions - temperature, wind and tide conditions interfere with place ment of the wrap and can adversely affect the qualit y of the repair. Strong winds and high tides are best avoided. Ideal conditions are low tide with light winds. Repair region - Corrosion is particularly prevalent in elements that are exposed to the 'splash zone', i.e. within 0.6-1.8 m of the water line. The combina tion of deposition of salt on the pile surface and alternate dry/wet cycles due to tid e change provide ideal conditions fo r corrosion in steel. This is the region that has to be repaired. There are, however, concerns that wrapping ma y result in migration of corrosion cells to locations above the FRP wrap as observed in conventional jacketed repairs. Laboratory tests 4,5 show that this can be avoided if the wrap is extended beyond the chloride contaminated part. 4. DESIGN OF FRP WRAP The economics of underwater FRP repa ir require that the wrap be e ngineered. The right FRP material with the optimal fiber layout should be selected to simplify field placement. This requires information on (1) the capacity loss that has to be restored and (2) the post-wrap expansion that has to be accommodated. Capacity loss is restored by orienting fi bers parallel to the steel, i.e. length-wise. Expansion requires fibers in the tran sverse or hoop direction, i.e. perpe ndicular to the main steel. Both requirements are met by using bi-directional FRP material. Estimation of Strength Loss - The problems posed in estimating stre ngth loss are no different than that for repairs conducted under dry conditions. The first st ep is the estimation of metal loss. This depends on whether the corrosion is uniform or there is localiz ed pitting corrosion. Estimation will be reliable if corrosion is so severe that the enti re bar is fully exposed. Unfortunate ly, even if the steel loss were known, there is no simple relationship between meta l loss and resulting ultimate capacity reduction since it depends on a number of factors such as the bond between steel and concrete, the confinement provided by the ties and ductility reduc tion in steel due to corrosion. Emmons 6mentions that capacity reduces for steel if corrosion exceeds 1.5%; data he quot ed stated that at 4.5% corrosion the ultimate load reduced by 12%. This suggests that it would be foolhardy to assume a linear relationship between metal loss and capacity even when lo sses are quite modest. In our demo nstration studies, the metal loss was conservatively assumed to be 20%. Corrosion Expansion - Although several experimental studi es have been conducted to measure transverse strain due to corrosion expansion 1, the results inevitably incorp orate strains resulting from 3rd COBRAE Conference, Benefits of Composites in Civil Engineering, University of Stuttgart, March 28-30 173unrestrained crack opening. CALTRANS6 have a method for determining the number of FRP layers required to withstand lateral e xpansion during earthquakes. Though intended for circular sections, factors are provided that allow rect angular sections of certain proportions to be designed. After careful analysis, a strain limit of 0.1% - approximately th ree times the maximum tens ile strain leading to cracking - was selected and was used in design5. Analysis -An interaction diagram-based method was deve loped for designing the wrap for restoring capacity lost by corrosion. In the an alysis only the FRP contribution to tensile strength was considered. The confinement effect of concrete was disregarded since it leads to modest increases in the ultimate axial capacity in non-circular sections. It was found that the assumed 20% stre ngth loss was restored by using two transverse and one longitudinal carbon la yer for the material prope rties outlined in Tables 1-2. For the weaker glass, two longit udinal and four transverse layers we re required to attain the same objective. The wrap selected was checked to ensure that it had a transverse strain capacity of 0.1% to accommodate the expected transverse expansion. 5. FRP MATERIALS Two types of materials were used in all the repairs. One was a pr e-preg, the other a wet lay up. The pre-preg system was from Air Logistics in which all the FRP material was cut to size, resin-saturated in the factory and sent to the site in hermetica lly sealed pouches. The wet lay up system required on- site impregnation and was from Fyfe. An additional wet lay up system was also used but this repair was carried out under dry conditions inside a coffer dam 5. For this reason, it is not discussed in this paper. Both carbon and fiberglass were used. Details of the properties of the fiber and the resin as provided by the suppliers are summarized in Tables 1 to 27, 8. Table 1.

FIELD WRAP The field demonstration projects were conducted in two phases. The first phase (completed in 2005) focused primarily on the feasibility of conducting an FRP repair of partially submerged pile. The 3rd COBRAE Conference, Benefits of Composites in Civil Engineering, University of Stuttgart, March 28-30 174second phase (on-going) is intended to refine and improve the application to make underwater FRP repairs competitive in the market place. The sites for all the demonstration projects we re identified by the Florida Department of Transportation because of the aggressiveness of th e environment. This was confirmed from chloride content analysis of concrete cores taken from severa l piles. The chloride content at the level of the reinforcement generally exceeded the threshol d required for corrosion to be initiated. The first demonstration project was carried out on piles supporting th e Allen Creek Bridge, Clearwater, FL. It was selected because it is in shallow, relati vely calm waters. The remaining studies were carried out on piles supporting Gandy Boulevard bridges spanning Tampa Bay, the largest estuary in Florida. The first of these two bridges is the Friendship Tra ils Bridge, now a recreati onal trail for pedestrians and cyclists. The second is the Gandy Bridge that is adjacent to the Friendship Trails Bridge. The waters of Tampa Bay are deeper and more turbulent than those of Allen Creek Bridge and the site is more representative of conditions where actual pile repairs are carried out. 6.1 Surface preparation Good bond requires the substrate to have an open pore structure to ensure capillary suction of the resin 6. In underwater repair, however, por es are saturated with water, small marine organisms or algae. As mentioned earlier, marine growth at the water line (Fig. 2) needs to be scraped off first. Additionally, sharp corners have to be ground to an acceptable radius using an air-powered grinder. This is a difficult operation particularly for sections that are below the water line. Quick-setting hydraulic cement was used to fill any depression, discontinuities and provide a smooth surface for wrapping. Just prior to the wrap, the entire surfa ce must be pressure-washed using fresh water to remove all traces of dust, marine organisms and new algae growth. Fig. 4. Scaffolding used for repair 6.2 Scaffolding Excepting for the Allen Creek Bridge that was locat ed in shallow waters, the remaining two bridges were in deeper waters in the middle of Tampa Ba y. Whereas ladders were suitable for the Allen Creek Bridge site, a customized scaffolding system had to be designed, fabricated and installed for the other applications. Fig. 4 shows the scaffolding used in the Friendship Trails Bridge. This was developed for 3rd COBRAE Conference, Benefits of Composites in Civil Engineering, University of Stuttgart, March 28-30 175a project in which all piles in a bent had to be wrapped. Thus, the scaffolding extended over the entire length of the pile cap. In subse quent studies, only 1 or 2 piles in a bent were wrapped and the scaffolding was re-designed for the smaller number of piles. This resulted in a lighter scaffold catering to individual piles. It wa s supported by steel chains so that it could be readily moved to provide access to other piles in the same bent that were to be repaired. 6.3 Impregnating FRP As mentioned earlier, two different systems - a pre- preg and a wet layup were used. In the pre-preg system, the FRP was saturated with resin in a factor y and sent to the site in hermetically sealed packages that were opened just prior to the wrap. In contrast, the wet layup system required on-site impregnation. This meant that the FRP fabric had to be pre-cut to size and then saturated with resin on- site (Fig. 5). In the initial application, an impregnating machine was built but this was abandoned in favor of manual application. In the latter, the two parts of the resin were mixed and then applied over the surface of the FRP fabric with a roller. The fabric was then flipped over and the other surface similarly saturated. The saturated elements were made into a roll for easy transportation. Fig. 5. Saturating FRP on site Fig. 6. Applying transverse wrap 6.4 FRP wrap For the pre-preg system, a layer of the same uretha ne resin was first applied to the pile surface to improve the FRP-concrete bond. Subsequently, the l ongitudinal layers were placed on each face. The transverse piece was wrapped around it (Fig. 6) in a spiral fashion (excepting at the top and bottom locations) with no overlap. This sequence was repeated for multiple layers. A fiberglass veil material was also used to wrap transversely ar ound the pile to provide a smooth finish. For the wet lay up epoxy system, the saturated FRP material was directly wrapped on the concrete surface in the same manner - first longitudinal then transverse. Following completion of the wrap, a plastic shrink material was wound tightly around the p ile to hold it in place while the resin cured. For the pre-preg, the surface of the plastic was punctured so that gases generated when the urethane resin cured could escape. After 24 hours, the plastic wrap was removed and a protective UV layer applied on the wrapped surface. In each of the applications, a 1.5-1.8 m depth of th e pile was wrapped using the appropriate number of longitudinal and transverse FRP layers. The wr apping operation generally took less than an hour. 3rd COBRAE Conference, Benefits of Composites in Civil Engineering, University of Stuttgart, March 28-30 1766.5 Post wrap performance The majority of the piles wrapped were inst rumented to provide information on long term performance. Different instrumentation schemes we re used so that the corrosion current or the corrosion rate could be determined. In general, corrosion performance of the FRP was monitored until the official end date for the project. This was longest for the Allen Creek Bridge where monitoring continued for over two and a half years. Results indicated that the perfor mance of carbon and glass were comparable and were superior to that of th e unwrapped control. Thus, these results replicated laboratory findings. More details may be found elsewhere 4,5. In addition to corrosion monitoring, the integrity of the FRP-concrete bond was evaluated destructively from on-site pullout tests. The re sults indicated that the bond was va riable. For the epoxy system, the bond was found to be poorer in the dry part of the pile. For the pre-preg system it was worse for the wet region. Analysis of the results suggested that th is was partly because of the difficulty in tightly wrapping material above shoulder height and also because of gases released by the pre-preg system during curing. 7. NEW DEVELOPMENTS The results from the first phase were promising becau se it demonstrated that it was feasible to wrap corroding piles under typical field conditions. More over, corrosion rate measurements offered assurance that the FRP material was behaving in the same manner as in the laboratory. However, field bond performance was inferior compared to laboratory conditions. The second phase was initiated in late 2005 to refine and improve the technology. Its goal is twofold: first to develop techniques that would result in le ss variability in the FRP-c oncrete bond. The second is to explore the possibility of incorporating a sacrificial cathodic protection system within the wrap. Laboratory studies were made during 2005-2006 to evaluate alternative methods for improving the underwater FRP-concrete bond. In the tests, full-si zed piles were used. Two candidate techniques widely used in aerospace were identified and adap ted for pile repair. These were (1) vacuum bagging and (2) pressure bagging. Prototype systems were developed and the bond evaluated both non- destructively and destructively. Both techniques wo rked but from the practical standpoint it was concluded that pressure bagging was si mpler to implement in the field. Pressure bagging was successfully used in field repairs on piles supporting the Friendship Trails Bridge 10. Qualitatively, the bond appeared to be impr oved though no on-site destructive bonds have yet been conducted. Such tests are planned in the futu re. Funding was recently received for implementing a pilot sacrificial cathodic protection system. This is expected to be implemented over the next 6-9 months at the same Friendship Trails Bridge site. 8. DISCUSSION Over the past four years, steady progress has been made in advancing the state-of-the-art for FRP underwater pile repair. The demons tration projects completed to date have identified and solved several of the technical and logistic problems encountered or anticipated for the field wrap. These have been in these four areas: (1) instrumentation an d monitoring (2) design (3) scaffolding and (4) new techniques for improving the underwater FRP-concrete bond. 3rd COBRAE Conference, Benefits of Composites in Civil Engineering, University of Stuttgart, March 28-30 177Currently, the research team is looking at (1) deve loping a low-cost prototype for non-destructive field evaluation of the FRP concrete bond and (2) impl ementation of a sacrificial cathodic protection system. Additionally, consideration will be given towards implementing instrumentation that will allow remote monitoring and further refinement of th e design procedure. The ove rall goal is to develop a cost effective, underwater FRP wrap system. 9. CONCLUSIONS This paper provides a brief overview of FRP system s used in demonstration projects to repair corroding piles. Over the years, techniques have evolved to make the wrapping more cost effective. Initially, wrapping was carried out directly in wate r using ladders and later using a custom-designed scaffolding system. Two different FRP systems, a pr e-preg and a wet layup, were evaluated and both carbon and glass tested. In each case, piles were instrumented to allow the long term performance of the FRP material to be assessed. Based on our experience, it is clear that it is feasible to use FRP for underwater corro sion repair. The performance of the FRP in slowing down the corr osion rate appears to be comparable to that determined from laboratory testing. The repairs have held up well with the l ongest nearly four years old at this time. The FRP-conc rete bond however was found to be poorer than that obtained under laboratory conditions. Work is continuing to further improve the FRP sy stem. A pressure bagging technique was developed last year to improve bond and the feasibility of in corporating a cathodic protection (CP) system within the wrap is currently being examined. Overall, th e portents are promising and hopefully will culminate in the availability of a cost effective solution for re pairing piles that is accep ted by highway authorities.

In the study, 22 one-third-scale pile specimens 15 \u00d715 cm in cross section were fabricated with 3% by weight cementitious material (corresponding to 15.1 kg/m3chloride ions) so that the passive layer protecting steel was immediately destroyed.Of these, 16 were wrapped by using carbon (eight specimens) andglass (eight specimens) FRPs at 28 days' strength. The remainingsix unwrapped specimens were used as controls. Embedded acti-vated titanium reference electrodes and thermocouples were used toinstrument the specimens so that the performance of the FRP ma-terial could be evaluated nondestructively from half cell readings and linear polarization measurements. A total of 20 specimens\u201416 wrapped and four unwrapped controls\u2014were exposed to simulated tidal cycles in 3% saltwater inan outdoor environment for more than 3 years. Two other unwrapped controls were exposed to the same environment indoors over the sameperiod. Within 1 year, there were cracking and rust stains in the un-wrapped controls. No similar visible signs of corrosion were detectedin the wrapped specimens exposed to the identical environment. The corrosion state of the specimens was monitored throughout the exposure period. Linear polarization measurements indicatedthat the average corrosion rate in the controls was 0.018 mm/yearcompared to only 0.0055 mm/year in the wrapped specimens. Theserates are commensurate with corrosion where visible damage can beexpected within 2 to 10 years. Since the controls cracked within the rst year, the measured uniform corrosion rates underpredictedthe true corrosion state in the controls. After more than 3 years of exposure, the specimens were removed from the tanks and cut open to retrieve the strands and ties from all thewrapped and unwrapped specimens. The metal loss was determinedin accordance with established gravimetric procedures outlined inASTM G1-90. A summary of the results of the measured metal loss is given in Figure 1, which shows that the metal loss in the strands in FRP-wrapped specimens (ranging from 3.4% to 4.4%) was considerablysmaller than that in the controls (12.6%). These results corroboratedwell with measured corrosion rates from the linear polarization men-tioned earlier. The results also suggested that an increased number oflayers did not necessarily lead to improved performance. The bestresults were obtained by using two layers. It is not evident why resultswith a greater number of layers were inferior, although a similarnding had been reported earlier (1 ). The results from the gravimetric measurements are somewhat mis- leading because they reflect average values. This does not account for breaks in individual wires in the strands that were discovered. ThereFiber-Reinforced Polymer Repair and Strengthening of Structurally Decient Piles Rajan Sen, Gray Mullins, and Mohsen Shahawy The poor durability of conventional repairs has led to increased interest in the application of ber-reinforced polymers (FRP) for repairing cor-roded concrete structures. The availability of resins that can cure underwet conditions has made it possible to consider FRP for repairing par-tially submerged piles. An overview is provided of a recently completedmultiyear study that investigated this problem. In the project, laboratorystudies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of FRP in corro-sion repair, and two eld demonstration projects were completed. A sim-ple, new design method was developed and used for the design of the FRPwrap in the demonstration projects. Some of the issues related to pilerepair are addressed, with particular attention to the newly developed design method. Fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) have been used for the repair and retrot of concrete structural elements for more than two decades.Their light weight, high strength, and resistance to chemicals offerobvious advantages. In fabric form, they provide unprecedented flex-ibility since bers can be oriented to provide strength in any desireddirection. More recently FRP also has been used for corrosion repair. This application is somewhat controversial because of uncertainty regard-ing the consequences of continuing corrosion inside the wrap. None-theless, several demonstration projects have been completed, mostcarried out under dry conditions ( 1). The problems associated with conducting FRP repairs on partially submerged elements were greatly reduced following the availabilityof resins that can cure under wet conditions. This development, alongwith the proposed, rational FRP design method, has the potential tomake FRP competitive in the market place. This paper provides an overview of a recently completed research project. It contains information on a long-term exposure study to eval-uate the effectiveness of FRP in corrosion repair and also addressesgeneral issues relating to FRP repair of structurally decient piles. Adetailed description of the design method is included, along with abrief summary on the eld demonstration projects. Complete detailson the entire study may be found in the nal report ( 2). R. Sen and G. Mullins, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Uni- versity of South Florida, 4202 East Fowler Avenue, Tampa, FL 33620. M. Sha hawy, Engineering Corresponding author: R. Sen, sen@eng.usf.edu. 180were 30 total wire breaks in the six unwrapped control specimens. Figure 2 shows such a wire break in a strand. In contrast, thestrands in the FRP-wrapped specimens showed no similar damage(Figure 2b )\u2014in fact, there was only one wire break of 64 strands in the 16 wrapped specimens. The wire breaks most likely were theresult of localized pitting corrosion that may have occurred at a sec-tion that was cracked. Taking the wire breaks into consideration,FRP wrapping led to signicantly improved performance. Although some of the metal loss in the FRP-wrapped specimens may have occurred in the 28 days before the specimens were wr apped, the results clearly indicate that FRP material cannot stop corrosion,although it can slow it signicantly. Thus, service life is extended.This increase in service life is shown schematically by using Tuutti'smodel in Figure 3 (4 ). With the destruction of the passive layer, cor- rosion was initiated at the same time in both the controls and thewrapped specimens. However, the much lower corrosion rate in thewrapped specimens implies that the specimens took longer to crackand to subsequently deteriorate. If the FRP repair can extend thelife of a repair by, say, 5 to 10 years, it may well prove to be a cost-222 Transportation Research Record 2028 effective alternative to repairs in which the piles repairs are carriedout in conjunction with cathodic protection. ISSUES RELATING TO UNDERWATER FRP REPAIR The critical issues relating to underwater FRP repair of partially sub- merged piles are in many respects similar to those for repairs carriedout under dry conditions. Some of these are addressed briefly here. Repair Region Corrosion is particularly prevalent in elements that are exposed to the splash zone, that is, within 0.6 to 1.8 m of the water line.

Steel Loss Wrapped Control Max. AcceptableSteel Loss Initiation of Crack Initiation of Corrosion Time Limit of Service Life FRP Installed 181nation of deposition of salt on the pile surface and alternate dry-wet cycles caused by tide change provides ideal conditions for corrosionin steel. This is the region that has to be repaired. There are concerns,however, that wrapping may result in migration of corrosion cells tolocations above the FRP wrap, as observed in conventional jacketedrepairs. Laboratory tests, however, showed that this can be avoided ifthe wrap is extended beyond the chloride contaminated region ( 2, 3). Access Repair requires easy access to the entire region to be wrapped. Cofferdam construction permits such access; however, it is likely tobe costly. Customized scaffolding systems offer a cost-effectivesolution and were used in the demonstration projects in deep waters.In essence, a lightweight horizontal platform was constructed of twoexpanded steel mesh sections that were bolted in place around thepiles. The assembly was suspended from the pile cap by steel anglesor chains (2). Environment Temperature, wind, and tide conditions interfere with the proper placement of the wrap and can adversely affect the quality of therepair. Strong winds and high tides are best avoided. Ideal conditionsare low tide and light winds. Cleaning Steel The International Concrete Repair Institute provides guidelines on the repair of deteriorated concrete resulting from steel corrosion ( 5, pp. 915-924). This requires undercutting of all exposed corrodedbars to provide access for cleaning the full circumference of the bar.Additionally, delaminated concrete must be removed to provide min-imum thickness of the repair material. At edge locations, right anglecuts are required so that there is no feather edge, that is, so the depthof the cut is not reduced at the edges. However, in most demonstra-tion projects reported in the literature, no particular attempt wasmade to comply with these guidelines because of the cost and poten-tial danger to the structure. Instead, the wrap was designed to accountfor a greater steel loss. Surface Preparation As FRP pile repairs are in part contact critical (to withstand expan- sion due to corrosion) and in part bond critical (to allow flexuralstrengthening), surface preparation is crucially important. Unlikerepairs above ground, pile repair necessitates removal of marinegrowth that forms at the water line. This is best removed by using air-driven needle scalers or grinders or simply by chipping. Followingremoval of this growth, the surface needs to be cleaned and madesmooth again. High-pressure washing using fresh water is the mosteffective technique for cleaning. The American Concrete Institute'sGuide to Underwater Repair recommends a pressure of 68.5 MPa (10,000 psi) with a standoff distance of 10 to 80 mm (0.5 to 3 in.) andan impingement angle of 40\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 for best results (6 ). With a flow rate of 100 L/min (26 gal/min), cleaning rates of 0.35 to 0.65 m 2/min (4 to 7 ft2/min) are attainable.Sen, Mullins, and Shahawy 223 DESIGN OF FRP WRAP The economics of underwater FRP repair require that the wrap be properly engineered. The right FRP material with the optimal berlayout should be selected to simplify eld placement. This requiresinformation on (a ) the capacity loss that has to be restored and ( b) the postwrap expansion that has to be accommodated. Capacity loss isrestored by orienting bers parallel to the steel, that is, lengthwise.Expansion requires bers in the transverse or hoop direction, that is,perpendicular to the main steel. Both requirements are readily met byusing bidirectional FRP material. Estimation of Strength Loss The problems posed in estimating strength loss are no different from those for repairs conducted under dry conditions. The rst step is theestimation of metal loss. This depends on if the corrosion is uni-form or if there is localized pitting corrosion. Estimation may be reli- able if corrosion is so severe that the entire bar is fully exposed.Unfortunately, even if the steel loss were known, there is no simplerelationship between metal loss and resulting ultimate capacity reduc-tion since it depends on other factors, such as the bond between steeland concrete, the confinement provided by the ties, and ductilityreduction in steel because of corrosion. Emmons mentioned thatcapacity reduces for steel if corrosion exceeds 1.5% ( 7); data he quoted stated that at 4.5% corrosion, the ultimate load reduced by12%. This suggests that it would be foolhardy to assume a linearrelationship between metal loss and capacity even when losses arequite modest. In the present demonstration studies, the metal losswas conservatively assumed to be 20%. Corrosion Expansion Although several experimental studies have been conducted to mea- sure transverse strain caused by corrosion expansion ( 2, 7-9), the results inevitably incorporate strains resulting from unrestrained crackopening (see Table 1). The California Department of Transportation(Caltrans) has a method for determining the number of FRP layersrequired to withstand lateral expansion during earthquakes (10).Although intended for circular sections, factors are provided thatallow rectangular sections of certain proportions to be designed. ASSUMPTIONS Several simplifying assumptions were used in the analysis because of lack of information. Some of the more important ones are as follows: 1. The loss of prestressing steel was conservatively taken as 20%.2. The increase in concrete strength because of the conning effect of the FRP material was disregarded (11, 12). 3. The postwrap expansion strain is based on the ultimate tensile strain. For simplicity this was assumed to be 10% of the ultimatecompressive strain of 0.003. In piles, corrosion is rarely uniform butusually starts at a corner, from which corrosion can proceed in twodirections. In view of this, a factor of safety of 3 was assumed toaccount for this nonuniformity. Thus, the design tensile strain wastaken as 0.001. 1824. The bond between the FRP and the concrete is assumed to be perfect. As a cofferdam was used, and the wrap was conducted under a dry environment, this was a reasonable assumption. 5. Only the carbon ber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) material on the tension face of the column is considered. 6. The distance from the extreme compression or tension ber to the centroid of the prestressing strands was taken as 3 in. (75 mm). 7. The prestressing strands in the demonstration piles were assumed to be stress relieved, and their effective prestress was takenas 135 ksi (930 MPa). MATERIAL PROPERTIES The CFRP material used was a bidirectional fabric wrap using Amaco bers. Its properties are summarized in Table 2. The epoxy used is aspecially formulated resin marketed as the MAS2000 repair system.Its basic properties are shown in Table 3. Carbon properties relate tothe individual yarns, which make up the larger weave. These yarns areproduced from a continuous-length, high-strength, high-modulusber consisting of 12,000 laments. The 12,000 laments produceone strand with a total cross-sectional area of 0.45 mm 2(70 \u00d7105in.2) and a tensile strength of 3,654 MPa (530 tensile strength perunit length is 4.34 kN/cm (2.48 kips/in.).224 Transportation Research Record 2028 RESTORING CAPACITY LOSS For the assumptions made, the well-known strain compatibility analy- sis may be extended to apply to cross sections strengthened by usingFRP. With this analysis, a parametric study was carried out to deter-mine the effect of prestress loss on the tension face or the compres-sion face strands in the M n-Pninteraction diagram. Three levels of prestress loss, namely, 0%, 10%, and 20%, were considered. Thestudy showed that the differences between the M n-Pndiagrams relat- ing to uniform loss (i.e., distributed in all faces of the column) and losson strands located on the tension face only, on one hand, and on com-pression face only, on the other hand, were negligible for 0% to 20%loss and did not affect the design. For this reason, the results reportedare for uniform loss on all four faces. M-P DIAGRAMS Figure 4 shows the M n-Pninteraction diagrams for the 14 \u00d7 14 in. (355 \u00d7355 mm) piles corresponding to a uniform prestress loss of 0% and 20%. It may be seen that the compression-controlled part of the diagram does not change with prestress loss due to corrosion.However, the flexure-controlled portion is substantially affected bythe loss. A 20% loss resulted in an approximate 15% decrease in themoment capacity for typical axial service loads. Also shown in Fig-ure 4 are the results from strengthening with two and three layers ofcarbon wraps. It may be concluded that for an assumed concretecompressive strength of 4 ksi (27.6 MPa), two layers of CFRP aresufficient to compensate for 20% loss in prestressing reinforcementand to restore the initial capacity of the pile. Figure 5 shows the effect of compressive concrete strength on the overall performance. The variation of concrete strength generallyinfluences the axial load capacity and, to a lesser magnitude, themoment capacity. The gure shows that use of two layers of CFRP issufficient to establish the original load-carrying capacity regardless ofthe assumed compressive concrete strength. CORROSION EXPANSION DURING SERVICE LIFE The strengthening solution outlined uses only the longitudinal bers of the FRP wrap. In other words, the connement effect of the lateralCFRP bers in the case of a bidirectional wrap on the compressiveTABLE 1 Measured Expansion Strain Transverse Author Specimen and Test Details Steel Loss Strain (%) Comments Lee et al.

This conne-ment effect provided by the FRP wrap in the transverse directioncan also be used to mitigate corrosion by containing the expansionof the concrete that develops as steel corrodes during the servicelife of the pile. The number of layers of FRP wrap needed to contain corrosion expansion is an important element that must be examined. In thefollowing calculations, three methods are used to address the prob-lem. These methods are based on (a ) Caltrans recommendations (13), (b ) ISIS recommendations (14), and (c ) the model proposed 184226 Transportation Research Record 2028 where 0.9 is a reduction factor for modulus of elasticity of FRP; resulting in t =0.02 in. (0.51 mm); - Carbon layer thickness, t (1 layer) = 0.0048 in. (0.122 mm); - Number of layers = - Rectangular section needs 1.5 \u00d7 4.16 =6.24 (say, seven layers). 2. Other region: where 0.9 is a reduction factor for modulus of elasticity of FRP; resulting in t =0.0098 in.

As mentioned earlier, expansion just before cracking (the ultimate tensile strain) is roughly 10% of the ultimate compressive strain (0.1)(0.003) = 0.0003 and provides a lower bound on the expansion strain. It is believed that a strain valueof 0.001 (that is, a safety factor of 3) is appropriate for this case. Inthis case, the conning stress for three layers of CFRP lateral con-nement (t =3 \u00d70.0048 =0.0144 in.) can be calculated as follows by using the Caltrans equation: where f l=2 (0.0144)(33,500,000)(0.9)(0.001)/(15.8) or fl=55 psi for a circular section. That is, 1.5 \u00d755 =83 psi for a rectangular column. With the Caltrans equation and for a confining stress of 150 psi and a strain of 0.001, 4 \u00d72.04 =8.2 layers of CFRP wrap would be needed for a circular column and 8.2 \u00d7 1.5 =12.3 layers for rec- tangular columns. Table 4 gives the number of CFRP layers for different confinement strains and stresses following the Caltransrecommendations.2 0 9 0 001tE f Djl()()() ( ) =() () ..2 33 500 000 0 9 0 004 150 15 8 ( ) .. p s i2 33 500 000 0 300 2000 Mn(kip-in.)Pn(kip)0 L, 0% loss 0 L, 20% loss 2 L, 20% loss 3 L, 20% loss 0 L, 0% loss 2 L, 20% loss 3 L, 20% lossf'c=4 ksif'c=6 ksi FIGURE 5 Effect of concrete strength. t D fl t TT FIGURE 6 Hoop stress in FRP wrap.column. Based on the cross-sectional area of concrete, the square pile 14 \u00d7 14 in. is equivalent to a circular pile with a diameter D of 15.8 in. (400 mm). Caltrans recommends a conning stress of 300 psi (2,068 kPa) at a strain of 0.004 in the hinge region and 150 psi (1,034 kPa) at astrain of 0.004 in other regions. Following Figure 6 the thickness ofthe FRP can be calculated by using the well-known expression forhoop stress given by Equation 1 as where t=dry ber thickness, D=equivalent column diameter, f l=conning stress, Ej=Young's modulus of the jacket material multiplied by a reduction factor of 0.9, and /H9280j=dilating strain in the FRP material. The numerical applications are as follows: 1. Hinge region: 2 0 9 0 /H9280 (1) Model ISIS Canada limits the lateral strain in FRP wraps for rectangular columns to 0.002, which is twice the representative value for corro-sion assumed to be 0.001 in this paper. The lateral stress f l,frpis given by the following equation: where b=width of the concrete cross section, Efrp=modulus of elasticity of FRP, fl,frp=lateral stress of FRP, h=height of the concrete cross section, Nb=number of FRP layers, tfrp=thickness of one FRP layer, /H9280frp=strain of FRP, and frp=capacity reduction factor. Given that the number of layers recommended for a 20% loss is 2, the lateral stress corresponding to the same number of layers is calculated, that is, Nb=2. By using the above equation, it follows that For a conning stress of 138 psi and a strain of 0.002, two layers of FRP are required. It follows that for a 300-psi connement, asrecommended by Caltrans for plastic hinge zones, and a strain of0.002, 300/138 \u00d7 2 =4.3 layers will be required. Table 5 gives the number of CFRP layers for different connement strains and stresses following the ISIS recommendations. Model of Chaallal et al. On the basis of an expansion strain of 0.001 (that is, the strain at cracking multiplied by a safety factor of 3), the ultimate lateral strain,/H9280 cc,tfor a given confinement coefficient k(provided by two layers of CFRP) and an unconfined concrete strength fco, is calculated according to the model for rectangular columns as follows:fl,frp=\u00d7\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 +2 2 0 75 33 500 000 0 002 0 0048 14 1., , .. 44 14 14 138 where fcois 4,000 psi, and k,the stiffness factor, is given by That is, It follows that /H9280 cc,t=0.0015. The two CFRP connement layers provided will therefore pro- vide a lateral strain capacity of 0.0015. This strain value is of the same order as the representative strain corresponding to crack strain(0.001) times a safety factor of 3. Using this model and assuming that /H9280 cc,t=0.002 will require approximately 4.4 layers of CFRP. Table 6 gives the number of CFRP layers for different conne- ment strains based on this model. It may be seen that for prestress steel loss of up to 20%, two layers of CFRP wrapping can be used to restorethe initial capacity of the piles, while simultaneously accommodatingk=\u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 () = 33 500 2 0 14 14 0 0005,. , .kE f =+4 2 4 000 320 0002TABLE 4 CFRP Layers for Confinement Strain and Stress per Caltrans Model for Circular Column Connementa Number of CFRP Layersb Strain Stress (psi) Circular Rectangularc Comments 0.004 300 4.1 6.2 300 psi for hinge location in seismic areas 0.004 150 2.1 3.1 150 psi for nonhinge location in seismic areas 0.002 150 4.1 6.2 0.001 150 8.2 12.3 0.001 55 3 4.5 Values for 3 layers aFor circular column. bBased on thickness/layer =0.0048 in. cValue of circular times 1.5.

The sites for the demonstration project were identied by the Florida Department ofTransportation because of the aggressiveness of the environment. Thiswas conrmed from chloride analysis of concrete cores taken fromseveral piles. The chloride content at the level of the reinforcementgenerally exceeded the threshold required for corrosion to be initiated. The rst demonstration project was carried out on piles supporting the Allen Creek Bridge in Clearwater, Florida. It was selected becauseit is in shallow, relatively calm waters. The second was carried out onpiles supporting Gandy Boulevard bridges spanning Tampa Bay, thelargest estuary in Florida. Surface Preparation Good bond requires the substrate to have an open pore structure to ensure capillary suction of the resin. In underwater repair, however,pores are saturated with water, small marine organisms, or algae. Asmentioned, marine growth at the water line needs to be scraped offrst. Additionally, sharp corners have to be ground to an acceptableradius by using an air-powered grinder. This is a difficult operation,particularly for sections that are below the water line. Quick-settinghydraulic cement was used to ll any depressions and discontinuitiesand to provide a smooth surface for wrapping. Just before the wrap,the entire surface must be pressure washed by using fresh water toremove all traces of dust, marine organisms, and new algae growth. Scaffolding Scaffolding was needed to access the piles supporting the Gandy Bridge that spans Tampa Bay. A customized scaffolding system withmodular elements was designed, fabricated, and installed to providesuch access. Impregnating FRP Two different systems\u2014a pre-preg and a wet layup\u2014were used. In the pre-preg system, the FRP was saturated with resin in a factoryand sent to the site in hermetically sealed packages that were openedjust before the wrap. In contrast, the wet layup system required on-site impregnation. This meant that the FRP fabric had to be precut228 Transportation Research Record 2028 to size and then saturated with resin on site. In the initial application,an impregnating machine was built, but this was abandoned in favorof manual application. In the latter, the resin was mixed and appliedover the surface of the FRP fabric with a roller. The fabric was thenflipped over and the other surface similarly saturated. The saturatedelements were made into a roll for easy transportation. FRP Wrap For the pre-preg system, a layer of the same urethane resin was rst applied to the pile surface to improve the FRP-concrete bond. Sub-sequently, the longitudinal layers were placed on each face. Thetransverse piece was wrapped around it in a spiral fashion (exceptingat the top and bottom locations) with no overlap. This sequence wasrepeated for multiple layers. A berglass veil material was also usedto wrap transversely around the pile to provide a smooth nish. For the wet layup epoxy system, the saturated FRP material was directly wrapped on the concrete surface in the same manner\u2014rstlongitudinal, then transverse. Following completion of the wrap, aplastic shrink material was wound tightly around the pile to hold it inplace while the resin cured (Figure 7). For the pre-preg system, thesurface of the plastic was punctured so that gases generated when theurethane resin cured could escape. After 24 h, the plastic wrap wasremoved and a protective UV layer applied to the wrapped surface. In each of the applications, a 1.5- to 1.8-m depth of the pile was wrapped by using the appropriate number of longitudinal and trans-verse FRP layers. The wrapping operation generally took less thanan hour. Postwrap Performance Most of the piles wrapped were instrumented to provide informa- tion on long-term performance. Different instrumentation schemesTABLE 6 CFRP Layers for Confinement Strain per Author Model for Rectangular Columns Connement Straina Number of Layers 0.0015 2.0 0.002 4.4 0.003 10.6 0.004 20.9 aFor a concrete strength of 4,000 psi. FIGURE 7 View of shrink-wrapped FRP repaired piles, Gandy Bridge, Tampa Bay. 187were used so that the corrosion current or the corrosion rate could be determined. In general, corrosion performance of the FRP wasmonitored until the official end date for the project. This was longestfor the Allen Creek Bridge, where monitoring continued for morethan two and a half years. Results shown in Figure 8 indicate that the corrosion rate in the wrapped piles was lower than that in the unwrapped controls. Thus, these results replicated laboratory ndings. Details are availableelsewhere (2, 15). In addition to corrosion monitoring, the integrity of the FRP- concrete bond was evaluated destructively from on-site pullout tests (2). The results indicated that the bond was variable. For the epoxysystem, the bond was found to be poorer in the dry part of the pile.For the pre-preg system, it was worse for the wet region. Analysisof the results suggested that this was partly because of the difficultyin tightly wrapping material above shoulder height and also becauseof gases released by the pre-preg system during curing. CONCLUSIONS This paper provided a brief overview of a multiyear research study to evaluate the role of FRP in corrosion repair and also to explore thefeasibility of conducting eld repairs by using this technology. Thelaboratory studies that were carried out outdoors by using simulatedtidal cycles showed that FRP can signicantly reduce the corrosionrate (Figure 1). Retrieved strands were in far bar better condition (Fig-ure 2). Thus, long-term service is likely to be signicantly extended(Figure 3). All-around pile access was the main problem in the field repair. However, a customized scaffolding system easily solved this prob- lem. Surface preparation requires more work because the edgeshave to be rounded under water. Of the two systems investigated,the pre-preg was easier to use, but its bond with concrete wasSen, Mullins, and Shahawy 229 somewhat poorer particularly in the submerged regions. Long-termmonitoring of the corrosion rate shows that the performance of thewrapped piles (Figure 8) was similar to that observed in laboratorystudies. On the basis of this experience, it is clear that it is feasible to use FRP for underwater corrosion repair. The repairs have held up well,and the oldest is nearly 4 years old. Work is continuing to improve theFRP system. Overall, the portents are promising and, it is hoped, willculminate in the availability of a cost-effective solution for repairingpiles that is accepted by highway authorities.

The poor durability of conventional repairs has led to increased interest in the application of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) for repairing corroded concrete structures. Over the past decade, several highway agencies in Canada and US have conducted demonstra tion projects to evaluate the application of FRP for repairing corrosion damage. In most instances, repairs were limited to dry bridge elements that had corroded due to salt water runoff from faulty expansion joints or salt spray from passing vehicular traffic. These FRP repairs have held up well and show little sign of deterioration. Th e development of resins that can cure in water has led to interest in the possible application of FRP for the underwater repair of corrosion damaged piles. Over the past 4 years, USF completed several demonstration projects in which corroding reinforced and prestressed piles were repaired using FRP. Several of the piles were instrumented to allow long term monitoring of corrosion performance. This paper discusses issues that are relevant for underwater FRP repair with particular reference to the completed field demonstration projects. 1. INTRODUCTION Florida's long coastline and sub-tropical climate makes reinforcing and prestressing steel vulnerable to corrosion. Over the last seventy five years measures adopted to control it, such as increasing the cover, reducing permeability, using epoxy coating, have not always proven effective. Indeed, a random survey of fifteen Florida bridges [1] indicated that on an average, visible corrosion was evident, within 11.5 years of construction. Corrosion is particularly prevalent in elements that are exposed to the 'splash zone', i.e. within 0.6-1.8 m of the water line. The combination of deposition of salt on the pile surface and alternate dry/wet cycles due to tidal changes provide ideal conditions for corrosion in steel. Its inevitability is even factored in current Florida Department of Tr ansportation Structures Design Guidelines [2]. This requires prestressed piles located in 'extremely aggressive' salt water sites to be at least 60 cm x 60 cm regardless of loading . The rationale is that in time spalling of the concrete cover will reduce the cross-section so that if a 60 cm square p ile were used originally, a central core of 45 cm square would remain. Two types of repairs are typica lly conducted. For minor damage a 'chip and patch' repair is carried out in which the concrete in the corrodi ng region is chipped a nd replaced by new patch material. Where damage is more severe, a pile jack et is used to encapsulate the damaged region with the annular space between the pile and the jacket f illed with cementitious repair material. Since such repairs fail to address the electrochemical nature , corrosion continues unabated. In view of this, jackets nowadays incorporate a cathodic protection syst em [3]. While this system has proven to be effective, it may not always be affordable. Thus, ther e is a need for an alternative repair system that is more cost effective than the chip and patch repair yet not as expens ive as jacket systems incorporating cathodic protec tion. Fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) offer the prospect of being such a system. This paper describes the ap plication of FRP in pile repair. Second International Conference on Recent Advances in Composite Materials Bakht Symposium, New Delhi, India, Feb 20-23 1902. BACKGROUND Fiber reinforced polymers have long been used for the repair and retrofit of concrete structural elements. Their lightweight, high strength and resi stance to chemicals offer obvious advantages. In fabric form, they provide unprecedented flexibility in construction. Moreover, as fibers can be oriented as required they can provi de strength in any desired directio n. This versatility has led to several research studies to investigate whether FRP's strength and durability can be harnessed to successfully repair corrosion damage [4]. Since 2003, the University of South Florida (USF) have completed four demonstration projects in which FRP was used to repair piles at two contrasting sites. The first was at a shallow site where repairs could be carried out using ladders. The subsequent three repairs were undertaken in the deeper and more turbulent waters of Tampa Bay, Florida's largest estuary where the waters of Tampa Bay join with those of the Gulf of Mexico. Here the piles repaired were those supporting the 4.2 km long Gandy and the Friendship Trails Bridge s that connect Tampa and St. Petersburg. At the time the bridge was first opened to traffic in 1924, it was the longest bridge in the United States. 2.1 FRP materials Two types of materials were used in all the repairs. One was a pr e-preg, the other a wet lay up. The pre-preg system was from Air Logistics in whic h all the FRP material were cut to size, resin saturated in the factory and sent to the site in hermetically seal ed pouches. The wet lay up system required on-site impregnation and was from Fyfe. An additional wet lay up system was also used but this was carried out under dry cond itions inside a coffer dam [5]. Fo r this reason, it is not discussed in this paper. Both carbon and fiberglass were used. Details of the properties of the fiber and the resin as provided by the suppliers are summarized in Tables 1 to 2 [6, 7]. Table 1.

The former requires fibers to be oriented parallel to the steel, i.e. along the length; the latter requires fibers in the transverse or hoop direction, i.e. perpen dicular to the strands . This can be most conveniently accommodated by using bi-directional FRP material. However, in the demonstration projects both uni-directional and bi -directional materials were used. Available ACI [8] and ISIS [9] guidelines provid e design equations and worked out numerical examples. Design manuals for specific systems ar e also available, e.g. Fyfe Co [10]. Their provisions are comparable though equa tions are simplified. It should be noted that in all the guides mentioned, axial, flexural and shear strengthening are considered separately. Their interaction necessary for designing wraps for piles is not considered. The low strain capacity of the FRP makes th e maximum permissible strain, the critical parameter in design. For strengthening applications , ACI 440 guidelines [8] specifies strain limits for both \"contact-critical\" (FRP in intimate contact with the subs trate with no sp ecific adhesion requirement) and \"bond-critical\" (minimum adhesion required since load transfer is by bond) applications. For piles, the limit for contact-critic al application applies as the FRP material is wrapped completely around the circumference. This is set as the lower of 0.4% or 75% of the FRP design rupture strain. The latter limit was established from tests to avoid loss of aggregate interlock that can occur at strains belo w the ultimate fiber strain. As piles corrode, they expand in the lateral direction since the volume of the corrosion products can be as much 600% of the original steel [11] . To accommodate such a large potentially uniform increase, a lower maximum strain limit may be appropriate. This can be based on experimental data [12] or from other considerations. A strain limit of 0.1% - approximately three times the maximum tensile strain leading to cracking - was used for designing the FRP to with stand corrosion expansion [5]. This value was used since reported experimental strains, calculated from the total circumferential increase, tend to be on the high side as it includes unres trained movement of the crack. Interaction diagrams can be develope d for FRP strengthening as for reinforced concrete columns by using strain compatibility analysis [5]. The only difference is that the equations incorporate the contribution of th e FRP. Since FRP wrapping can pr ovide increased tensile but not increased compressive strength, only the tensile cont ribution should be considered in the analysis. Also, as the confinement effect of concrete leads to modest increases in the ultimate axial capacity in non-circular sections, it is best i gnored. As with most strengthening applications, the role of the FRP is passive. That is, the FRP is unstressed except for additional load applied to the structure after it has been retrofitted. In the applications, capacity loss was es timated to be 20%. It was found that this could be restored by using two transverse and one longit udinal carbon layer for th e material properties outlined in Tables 1-2. For the weaker glass, tw o longitudinal and four tr ansverse layers were required to restore capacity. Second International Conference on Recent Advances in Composite Materials Bakht Symposium, New Delhi, India, Feb 20-23 1922.3 Instrumentation Corrosion monitoring uses non-destructive electroc hemical methods that take advantage of the electrochemical nature of corrosi on. Available methods include measur ement of concrete resistance and resistivity, half-cell potential and corrosion current. However, in th e case of FRP wrapped elements where the concrete surface is inaccessi ble, sensors have to be embedded inside the concrete. For applications involving piles, the size of the sensor is critical since it must be small enough to be accommodated within the available 75 mm concrete cover. Embedded sensors may be used to evaluate the co rrosion state in wrapped piles using (1) linear polarization and (2) galvanic current measurement. Linear polarization is an established technique for measuring the corrosion rate of steel in concre te structures. It relies on the linear relationship between corrosion current and its potential when the equilibrium potential is perturbed by the application of an incremental current (\"galvanostatic\") or incremental voltage (\"potentiostatic\"). Several portable devices are avai lable that can be used to make the measurement. In the demonstration projects, a PR - Monitor Model 4500 manufactured by Cortest Instrument Systems, Inc. was used. In galvanic current measurements, sensors made of the same or different steel are embedded at different depths in the concrete. The small galv anic or macro-cell currents set up by the corrosion process between these sensors are measured typical ly using a zero resistance ammeter through an external connection. Both systems were used in the studies. 2.4 Sensor details Table 3 summarizes information on the type of sens ors used in the four demonstration projects. Three different types of sensors were used. Thes e included one developed by USF researchers, a commercially available one developed by Concorr In c. and a 'rebar' sensor used by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT). Table 3.

FIELD WRAP 3.1 Surface preparation The application of FRP for repair and strengthening of piles is part bond-critical and part contact- critical since the FRP material provides both stre ngthening and confinement. As with any bonded Second International Conference on Recent Advances in Composite Materials Bakht Symposium, New Delhi, India, Feb 20-23 193application, surface preparation is critical; good bond requires the s ubstrate to have an open pore structure to ensure capillary su ction of the epoxy [13]. In underwat er application, however, pores will be saturated with water or small marine organisms or algae. In all cases, the pile surfaces were covered with marine growth (Fig. 1) that had to be scraped off. Additionally, corners that were not rounded had to be ground using an air-powered grinder. This was a difficult operation particularly for sections that were below the water line. A quick-setting hydraulic cement was used to fill any depression , discontinuities and provide a smooth surface. The entire surface was pressure washed just prior to wrapping using fresh water to remove all dust, marine algae. Figure 1 . Marine growth Figure 2. Scaffolding used for repair 3.2 Scaffolding Excepting for the Allen Creek Bridge that was located in shallow waters, the remaining three bridges were located in the middle of Tampa Bay where a s caffolding system had to be set up for safety and also to provide all around access to the piles. Fi g. 2 shows the scaffolding used in the Friendship Trails Bridge. This was developed for a project in which all piles in a bent had to be wrapped. In subsequent studies, only 1 or 2 piles in the bent were wrapped and therefore the scaffolding was re- designed to cater to a single pile. This resulted in a lighter system that could be readily moved over to provide access to other piles. 3.3 Impregnating FRP As mentioned earlier, two different systems - a pre-preg and a wet layup were used. In the pre-preg system, the FRP was saturated with resin in a factory and sent to the site in hermetically sealed packages that were opened just prior to the wrap. The wet layup system required on-site impregnation. This meant that the FRP fabric had to be pre-cut to size and then saturated with resin. In the initial application, an impregnating machin e was built but this was abandoned in favor of Second International Conference on Recent Advances in Composite Materials Bakht Symposium, New Delhi, India, Feb 20-23 194manual application. In the latter, the two parts of the resin were mixed and then applied over the surface of the fabric that was placed on a plastic sheet. The resin was then impregnated on one surface using a roller, flipped over and the other surface similarly saturate d. The saturated element was then made into a roll for easy transportation (Fig. 3). Figure 3. Saturating FRP on site Figure 4. Applying transverse wrap 3.4 FRP wrap For the pre-preg system, a layer of the same uret hane resin was first applied to the pile surface. Subsequently, the longitudinal layers were placed on each face starting at the corners. The transverse piece was wrapped around it (Fig. 4). This process was repeated for additional layers. For the pre- preg system, a fiberglass veil material was also us ed to wrap transversely around the pile to provide a smooth surface. For the wet lay up epoxy system, th e saturated FRP material was directly wrapped on the concrete surface. Following completion of the wrap, a plastic shrink material was wound tightly around the pile to hold it in place while the resin cured. Fo r the pre-preg, the surface of the plastic was punctured so that gases generated when the resin cured could escape. After 24 hours, the plastic wrap was removed. A protective UV layer wa s applied on the wrapped surface. In each of the applications, a 1.5-1.8 m depth of the pile was wra pped using up to 4 layers. The wrapping operation generally took less than an hour to complete. Post wrap performance The corrosion performance of the FR P was monitored until the end of the project. This was longest foe the Allen Creek Bridge where monitoring was continued for over two and a half years. Results indicated that the performance of carbon and glass were comparable and were superior to that of the unwrapped control. More details may be found elsewhere [5]. FRP bond The FRP bond with concrete was evaluated in severa l cases using pullout tests. The results indicated that the bond was variable. For the epoxy system, the bond was found to be poorer in the dry part of the pile. For the pre-preg system it was worse for the wet region. Analysis of the results suggested that this could be because the pressure impressed by the shrink wrap on the FRP as it cured was insufficient to overcome the weight of the fabric . Laboratory tests were conducted to investigate Second International Conference on Recent Advances in Composite Materials Bakht Symposium, New Delhi, India, Feb 20-23 195alternative systems that could be used to overc ome this problem. Two promising techniques have been developed one which was implemented in the latest repair conducted on the Friendhsip Trails Bridge [14]. Future developments FRP slows down the corrosion rate by serving as a barrier element to the ingress of deleterious materials such as chlorides, moisture and oxygen. Ho wever, results from laboratory tests that show that corrosion continues inside th e wrap indicating that there is sufficient oxygen and moisture trapped inside the wrap to allow corrosion to c ontinue. This can be prevented by incorporating a cathodic protection system within the FRP wrap. Deve lopment work is currently being undertaken to examine how such a system can be implemented. Th e USF research team plan to complete such a demonstration study in 2007. CONCLUSIONS This paper provides a brief overv iew of FRP systems used in de monstration proj ects to repair corroding piles. Wrapping was carried out directly in water using ladders where the depth was shallow and using a custom designed scaffolding sy stem where the depth was greater. Two different systems were evaluated and both carbon and glass te sted. In each case, piles were instrumented to allow the long term performance of the FRP material to be assessed. Based on the experience it is clear that it is feas ible to use FRP for repairing corrosion damage. Results of long term monitoring indicate that wrapped specimens have lower corrosion rates. Repairs have held up well with the longest repair now nearly four years old. Work is continuing to further improve this app lication. Two areas that the research team are currently exploring are enhanc ing the FRP-concrete bond and secondly the feasibility of incorporating a cathodic protection (C P) system within the wrap. A project was recently completed [14] in which a new system to improve bond was used. The bond appears to be better. Tests will be carried out next year to quantify the bond. The FRP- CP system is expected to be also developed within the next few months. Results obtained relating to co rrosion performance are promising. The new techniques that are currently under development will significantly improve performance. Highway agencies will have access to another method of pile repair that may be economical in some situations.

Twenty-two 1/3-scale models of prestressed piles cast with built-in chloride were exposed to simulated tidal cycles under outdoor ambient conditions for nearly 3 years. These included eight carbon FRP (CFRP), eight glass FRP (GFRP)-wrapped sp ecimens, and six controls. Embedded titanium reference electrodes and thermocouples wereused to monitor the corrosion performance inside the wrapped region throughout the exposure period. The performance of the FRP was evaluated on the basis of bond and gravimetric tests conducted at the end of the exposure period. The results showed that the FRP-concrete bond was largely unaffected by exposure and both CFRP and GFRP-repaired specimens significantlyoutperformed the controls. The underlying trend in corrosion rate measurements showed increases for the controls and reductions for the wrapped specimens. This was reflected by much lower metallosses in wrapped specimens compared with controls. Overall, the study showed that FRP is effective in mitigating corrosion in a marine environment.

INTRODUCTION The poor performance of conventional repairs has led to renewed interest in the application of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) materials for rehabilitating corroded concrete structures. Despite higher material costs, FRP repairs may bemore economical if they result in a reduction in re-repairs that is often the reality for corrosion repair. Several highway agencies have explored this op tion over the past decade. In 1994, the Vermont Transportation Agency opted to use FRP over conventional methods for repairing corrosion-damaged columns because it resulted in 35% cost savings.1 For the same reason, the New York State Department of Transportation(NYDOT) chose FRP for repairing corrosion-damaged columns.2 More examples may be found in a recent state-of- the-art paper.3 The role of FRP in mitiga ting corrosion has been the subject of several investigations.3 The majority of the studies4-8 focused on applications relating to corrosion damage in reinforced concrete elements in cold regions caused by salt water run-off from faulty expansion joints. There have been fewer studies relating to corrosionmitigation in tidal waters under hot, humid conditions9-12 where corrosion rates are significantly higher. Suchapplications have only become possible13-16 because of the availability of new resins that can cure in water. In 2001, the Florida and U.S. Department of Transporta- tion funded a 44-month study to investigate the use of FRPfor the underwater repair of prestressed piles. The study included both laboratory testing and field demonstrations.This paper provides details of a long-term exposure studyconducted to assess the role of FRP in mitigating corrosion.In the study, instrumented, 1/3-scale models FRP (CFRP) and glass FRP (GFRP) wrapped prestressed piles were exposed to simulated tidal cycles under outdoorambient conditions for nearly 3 years. The performance of the FRP was assessed in compar ison to identical unwrapped specimens that were placed in the same environment through gravimetric testing. Complete details may be found in the final report. 12 RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE This paper provides quantitative data on the performance of FRP in reducing corrosion under exposure comparable to natural conditions. The use of embedded reference electrodes permitted the corrosion performance of the FRP wrapped region to be monitored throughout the exposure.Comparative data on the actual metal loss in identically exposed wrapped and unwrapped specimens is helpful for highway agencies in assess ing the efficacy of FRP in corrosion mitigation applications. OBJECTIVES The overall goal of the research project was to evaluate the effectiveness of FRP in slowing down corrosion in heavilychloride-contaminated prestressed concrete elements thatare characteristic of a marine environment. Both carbon and fiberglass were tested and the role of number of fiber layers investigated. Effectiveness was evaluated by monitoringcorrosion rate and by gravimetric testing in which the actual metal loss in strands and ties retrieved from exposed specimens was determined. EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM As corrosion is a slow proces s, two broad strategies have been used for accelerating corro sion. In the first method, electrochemical reactions responsible for corrosion aresimulated by applying appropriate corrosion currents usingeither a constant voltage or a constant current system. In the second method, acceleration is achieved by using permeable, high water-cement mixtures, heat, or by casting specimenswith chlorides. Specimens are subsequently exposed to simulated tidal cycles and subj ected to alternate drying and wetting. Acceleration may be achieved by manipulating the relative lengths of the dry and wet cycles. By making the drycycle longer, accessibility of oxygen is enhanced that canTitle no. 104-S09 Effectiveness of Fiber-Reinforced Polymer in Reducing Corrosion in Marine Environment by Kwangsuk Suh, Gray Mullins, Rajan Sen, and Danny Winters 19877 ACI Structural Journal/January-February 2007 accelerate the corrosion process. The first approach yields results more quickly. The second is slower, but corrosionproducts and processes are more representative of naturally occurring corrosion. In this study, the second approach was adopted in which specimens were exposed to simulated tidal cycles under outdoor ambient conditions. The wet-dry cycles were keptthe same but the exposure period made sufficiently long so that the difference in the performance of wrapped and unwrapped specimens would become apparent. Specimen details The specimens used in the study were 1/3-scale model of 45 cm (18 in.) square prestressed piles that had been identified in earlier studies as being the most common and, therefore, most commonly foun d to have exhibited corrosion damage. The 15 x 15 x 152 cm (6 in. x 6 in. x 5 ft) long specimens were prestressed by four 8 mm (5/16 in.), seven- wire, low relaxation 1860 MPa (Grade 270) strands (Fig. 1). This configuration ensured that the effective prestress in the model piles exactly matched that in the prototype when stressed to code-specified stressing levels. The central fifth strand shown in Fig. 1 was unstressed and served as acounter electrode for linear po larization tests that were used to monitor the corrosion rate in the steel. A 55 cm (22 in.) length corresponding to 1.67 m (66 in.) splash zone in the prototype was fabricated with 3% of chlorideion by weight of cementitious mate rial. This left 48 cm (19 in.) of regular concrete both above and below that was sufficient for full prestress force transfer (50 d b = 39.6 cm [15.6 in.]). Specimens were cast all at once in a single line in a specially adapted prestressing bed at a commercial facility. As a result, the prestressing forces and concrete mixtures were identical for all specim ens. Wood trims with a radius of 13 mm (1/2 in.) were inserted along the bottom corners of the form to ensure that there no sharp corners at theselocations. The edges at the top were finished using a 7.5 cm (3 in.) wide edging trowel so that these edges were also curved. This greatly reduced the preparation work required in subsequent wrapping. Instrumentation The prestressing forces at the live and dead ends were monitored during fabrication of the specimen to ensure that the final effective stresses were consistent with those in theprototype pile. Embedded activated titanium reference elec- trodes and thermocouples were installed at pre-designated locations as shown in Fig. 1. Embedded reference electrode s ensured greater reliability of the corrosion measurements (when compared with surfacemeasurements) by eliminating environmental effects due to changes in the temperature and humidity of the surface. More importantly, it allowed po tential measurements inside the wrapped region to be readily made without the need forcutting through the wrap to expose the concrete surface. Thermocouples enabled changes in corrosion rate with temperature to be assessed. Concreting The concrete placement was conducted in two phases: a regular FDOT Class V special mixture was first placed, vibrated, and finished followed by a second batch in which a measured amount of the chloride admixture 12 was added to the concrete mixer, rotated, and placed between sheet metalbarriers (dams) that were removed subsequently. The specimens were covered by a plastic sheet and allowed to cure. The average compressive strength at the time of release was 41.7 MPa (6.05 ksi) for the regular concrete and 34.3 MPa(4.98 ksi) for the chloride contaminated concrete. Wrap details The goal of the study was to evaluate the performance of FRP in specimens where the chloride threshold had been exceeded, but there was no visible sign of corrosion. For this reason, 16 specimens were wrapped when the concrete was 28 days old. FRP was applied over a 0.91 m (36 in.) length in the central region of the specimen. This meant that it extended 17.5 cm (7 in.) above and below the boundary of the 55 cm (22 in.) chloride contaminated region (Fig. 1). Eight specimens were wrapped with bidirectional CFRPusing bidirectional CFRP system . Eight others were wrapped using a bidirectional GFRP and epoxy. Material properties of the epoxies and the FRP provided by the manufacturers are summarized in Table 1 and 2. The number of FRP layers varied from 1 to 4 and the recom- mended lap length was provided. This was 5 cm (2 in.) for CFRP and 15 cm (6 in.) for GFRP.

TIDAL SIMULATION SETUP Twenty specimens (16 wrapped and four unwrapped controls) were placed upright in side a 1.82 x 3.04 x 1.22 m (6 x 10 x 4 ft) tank, which was kept outdoors (Fig. 2). Two unwrapped specimens were placed in an indoor tank in acontrolled environment and se rved as indoor controls. Details are summarized in Table 3. All outdoor and indoor specimens were subjected to simulated tidal cycles in 3.5% salt water (Fig. 2). Thevariation in water depth wa s modeled for the Tampa Bay region where the difference between high and low tide is approximately 45 cm (18 in.). The water level at high tidewas 80 cm (32 in.) from the bottom. It was 35 cm (14 in.) at low tide. The tide was changed every 6 hours and was controlled by a water pump and floating switch. Thisensured that a 5 cm (2 in.) length of the wrap was permanently submerged in water. This type of exposure had the maximum chance of trapping moisture within thewrap. Such entrapment of moisture had been observed in a study conducted by the University of Texas at Austin. 17 Specimens were exposed to this environment for nearly 3 years at which time they were removed for detailed examina-tion and analysis that included measurement of metal loss in wrapped and unwrapped specimens by gravimetric testing. CORROSION MONITORING Half-cell potential measurements were taken using a high impedance voltmeter. The embedded titanium reference electrodes were calibrated against a copper-copper sulfate reference electrode (CSE) and all results reported are withrespect to these electrodes. Potential measurements were regularly made with the first r eading taken 24 days after the specimens had been cast. Initia lly, measurements were taken weekly but became less frequent as readings stabilized following prolonged exposure. Linear polarization measurements were made using a PR monitor. This has a three-electrode probe comprising areference, working, and counter electrode. The central strand provided in the specimen (Fig. 1) served as the counter electrode. The PR monitor measures the polarizationresistance that is inversely proportional to the corrosion rate in the steel. In the calcula tions, the polarized area was assumed to be the same as the chloride-contaminated area (55 cm [22 in.] length). Concrete resistivity was measured using a soil-resistance meter. All thermocouples embedded in the concrete were hooked to a data acquisition system. Temperature data was measuredand recorded every hour. Connections to the steel and the titanium reference electrodes for the corrosion measure-ments were placed inside a weatherproof box (Fig. 3) that allowed readings to be readily taken. RESULTS Half-cell potentials Figure 4 provides an overview of the variation in the averaged half-cell potential (relative to copper-copper sulfate) measured at midheight, that is, at the center of thewrapped region for all the cont rols (four outdoors and two indoors) and the wrapped specimens (eight CFRP and eight GFRP). Wrapping was conducted on the 28th day and wet- dry cycles started on the 111th day after casting when thesimulated tidal setup became operational. All readings were more negati ve than -350 mV indicating that there was a 90% probabi lity of corrosion. The readings became much more negative immediately after the start of wet-dry cycles possibly because of the availability of water. For the specimens kept outdoors, potential changes were broadly similar for the first 350 days. After this time period, however, there was a divergence in the potential values withTable 1\u2014Material properties of epoxies Properties CFRP (MAS 2000) GFRP (Tyfo\u00ae S) Tensile strength, ksi (MPa) 45.2 (312) 10.5 modulus, ksi (M Pa) 2620 (18,064) 461 (MPa) Tyfo\u00ae Tensile strength, ksi (MPa) 90 (309) Modulus of elasticity, ksi (MPa ) 10,600 (73,084) 2800 (19,305) Elongation at break, % Thickness, in.

This change in readings coincided with the appearance of cracks along the strand line and the formation of corrosionproducts around cracks on the surface of the unwrapped control specimens (Fig. 5). There was no similar evidence of damage in any of the wrapped specimens. Nor were thereadings for CFRP and GFRP significantly different. Additional results 12 showed that the number of FRP layers had a relatively minor effect on the potential readings. Corrosion rate results Linear polarization measurements were taken at midheight where corrosion rates were expected to be the highest. Figure 6 provides an overview of all the results as well as the temperature variation. Each corrosion rate data point represents the average for that type of specimen (for example, eight CFRP, eight GFRP, two indoor controls, orfour outdoor controls). Additi onal plots showing individual results may be found in the final report.12 The corrosion rate in Fig. 6 is expressed in mm/year. Inspection of Fig. 6 shows that while corrosion rates in allspecimens declined during the period between wrapping and exposure to the simulated tidal cycles, the underlying trend in the subsequent results was an increase in the corrosion rate inthe controls and a decrease in the rate in the wrapped specimens. Undulations in the corrosion rate were largely due to variations in the ambient temperature at the time thereading was taken (always at low tide) and were more prominent in the outdoor controls when compared to the indoor specimens. The temperature of the indoor controls wasunfortunately not constant, but rather maintained for laboratory occupant comfort (near 25 \u00b0C [77 \u00b0F]) and would have fluctuated somewhat with the outdoor conditions. Therewas little difference between the corrosion rates in the CFRPand GFRP wrapped specimens; temperature-induced changes in corrosion rate were likewise apparent. Such temperature- induced corrosion rate variations are not surprising given theelectrochemical nature of the corrosion process. The average corrosion rate in the controls was 0.018 mm/year at the end of the exposure period. The wrapped specimens showapproximately 1/3 of this magnitude at 0.0055 mm/year. Thesevalues are commensurate with corrosion rates where visible damage can be expected in 2 to 10 years. 18 EFFECT OF EXPOSURE ON BOND Following conclusion of the exposure, test specimens were removed from the tanks for further evaluation andtesting. This included bond tests on the wrapped specimens,crack mapping of the controls , and gravimetric testing to quantify metal loss. The bond between FRP and concrete was determined from pull-out tests carried out in accordance with ASTM D 454119 using an adhesion tester. The tester used 3.6 cm (1.456 in.)diameter aluminum dollies. A total of eight wrapped specimens were tested: four CFRP specimens (No. 54, No. 55, No. 56,and No. 57) and four GFRP (No. 47, No. 48, No. 50, and No. 51) with one, two, three, or four FRP layers. The tests were performed on two faces of each specimen and at three locations per face (Fig. 7). The three levelsFig. 3\u2014Weatherproof measurement box.

Fig. 6\u2014Result of linear polarization tests. 20180 ACI Structural Journal/January-February 2007 selected were the dry zone (top), tidal zone (middle), and the submerged zone (bottom). The results of the bond test s for the CFRP- and GFRP- wrapped specimens are summarized in Fig. 8 and 9, respec- tively. The bond strength of CFRP specimens varied from 1.4 to 2.2 MPa (203 to 319 psi) and those for the GFRPspecimens from 1.4 to 2.6 MPa (203 to 370 psi). Most of the bond failures in the top and middle locations occurred in the concrete indicating that the bond was good. In thesubmerged zones, however, failure occurred in the epoxy. The average bond strength at these three levels considering all the specimens varied from 1.8 to 2.0 MPa (265 to 285 psi) in CFRP sp ecimens and from 1.8 to 2.1 MPa (261 to 301 psi) in GFRP specimens. Thus, the average bond strength was marginally higher in the glass-fiber specimens in comparison to the carbon fiber specimens.Although epoxy failure was the most commonly occurring mode in the submerged region , the measured ultimate bond stress was not significantly higher even where there was failure in the concrete. The bond strength was also unaffectedby the number of FRP layers in dicating that the inter-layer bond was good and the materi al was properly bonded in the first place. The somewhat poorer performance in thesubmerged region is not a resu lt of the installation method as all specimens were dry-wrapped but rather is more likely a consequence of ingress of moistu re into the resin over time. GRAVIMETRIC TESTING All 22 specimens were gravimetrically tested to determine the actual steel loss at the end of the 1160-day exposure period. As noted previously, the Texas study 17 reported that the FRP wrap had entrapped wate r that had led to increased corrosion inside the wrap. No similar entrapment was found in this study and no similar loca lized corrosion was observed. The strands and ties were extracted by making longitu- dinal cuts on the concrete surface with an electric saw andsubsequently carefully chipping the cover off to expose the steel (Fig. 10 and 11). Inspection of these figures shows thatthere was much greater corrosion in the unwrapped controls than in the wrapped specimens. In the wrapped specimens, there was no evidence of corrosion products in some speci-mens unlike that in the unwra pped controls where corrosion products were always present. The prestressing strands and ties were carefully extracted from all the specimens. The central-most section of the strands were cut to 0.91 m (36 in.) lengths, labeled, and numbered. The strands and ties were stored in sealed bags for subsequent cleaning. In the cleaning process, the strands were disassembled into seven se parate wires to ensure there was no trapped rust. A summary of the measured st eel loss from all the results is shown in Table 4. Because the target area contaminated with chloride was 55 cm long (22 in.), located in the central portion of the specimen (Fig. 1), the steel loss was assumed to have occurred only in the chloride-contaminated region.The total loss in all four stra nds and ties was averaged for each specimen and compared with the controls. It may be seen from Table 4 that the average steel loss in strands and ties in outdoor and indoor unwrapped specimens were similar (6.6 and 10.1% versus 6.6 and 8.9%). This suggests that temperature and humidity variation did notmake as much a difference. Thus, corrosion gains made in the outdoor specimens during summer and fall were offsetFig. 7\u2014Bond test.

In contrast, the fluctuations in the corrosion rate in specimens kept inside the laboratory were smaller. The performance of the wrapped specimens was much better as is evident from Fig. 10 and 11. The average metal loss instrands was 3.3% for CFRP and 3.4% for GRFP, approximately half that of the 6.6% in the controls. For the ties, average metalloss was 6.6% for carbon and 6.3% for glass compared with 10.1% for the outdoor controls (Table 4). Aside from the difference in metal loss, there were 30 breaks in individual wires making up the strands in the sixunwrapped specimens (average five breaks per pile) indicative of localized pittin g corrosion. In contrast, there was only one instance of breakage in the 16 wrapped specimens (0.0625 breaks per pile). Thus, the averaged readings do not completely reflect the actual performance ofthe unwrapped specimens compared with the wrapped ones. A more detailed breakdown of the gravimetric results showing the relationship between metal loss and number ofFRP layers is given in Table 5. It may be seen from this table that the performance of the FRP did not necessarily improve as the number of layers increased. Overall, the results forcarbon and glass were comparable. DISCUSSION The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the FRP in slowing down the corrosion rate in specimens in which the chloride threshold fo r corrosion initiation had beenexceeded prior to wrapping. He re, the passive layer protecting steel is destroyed; but there is no visible sign of corrosion. This condition is not uncommon a nd was encountered in recent field applications 14-16 where chloride levels in the cover were comparable to those used in the test specimens. The outdoor exposure setup and the simulated tidal cycles were very similar to natural conditions under whichcorrosion occurs in a marine en vironment. By using multiple embedded reference electrodes, both corrosion potential and linear polarization rates could be readily measured at the critical midheight without co mpromising the integrity and continuity of the wrap. These measurements indicated that FRP slowed down but did not stop the corrosion rate. The performance of the CFRP and GFRP were comparable and largely independent of the number of wrapping layers. Thesefindings were confirmed through destructive gravimetric testing where metal losses in wrapped specimens were measured to be significan tly lower than its identical unwrapped counterpart. The fact that FRP was unable to stop the corrosion process is not particularly surprising given that oxygen and moisturepresent inside the concrete prior to wrap were sufficient to sustain the electrochemical reaction.

As the FRP also confines the concrete, however, the confining pressures can compress the corrosion products and change the underlyingelectrochemical reactions. This may explain why trends in the corrosion rate measurements showed reductions in the corrosion rate over time (Fig. 6). The surprising result was that two FRP layers were optimal regardless of the material (Table 5). Providing a larger number of layers provided increased strength but did not help corrosion mitigation. It provides further evidencethat oxygen and moisture inside the wrap dictate the corrosion process. As results for one FRP layer were poorer, however, a minimum of two layers should be used in FRPcorrosion mitigation applications. A detailed examination of the profile of the corroded strand has not yet been made. Development work is currentlyunderway to construct an automated system that can electronically record the profile of the strands. Once this has been completed, tests will be conducted to determine thestress-strain characteristics of the corroded strands. These findings will be reported at a future date. CONCLUSIONS Based on the results presente d, the following conclusions may be drawn:1. The measured metal loss in wrapped specimens was significantly lower than that in identical unwrapped controls exposed to the same environment. Both CFRP and GFRP were equally effective in drastically reducing the rate of corrosion but were nonetheless un able to stop corrosion even when four layers were used (Fig. 12 and 13); 2. The performance of CFRP and GFRP in slowing down the corrosion rate was comparable (Table 4). The linear polarization measurements corr ectly predicted this and also the underlying trends in the metal loss in wrapped and unwrapped specimens (Fig. 5); 3. The level of corrosion protection afforded by FRP does not increase with the number of FRP layers. In this study, two layers were found to be the optimal number based on gravimetric testing (Table 5 and Fig. 12 and 13); 4. The gravimetric testing method used to determine metal loss is not fully indicative of the severity of the structuralimpact of the damage as the metal losses. Localized corrosion led to breakages in 30 wires in the six unwrapped controls. Such breakage was only observed in one wire from among all the 16 wrapped specimens; and 5. The average residual bond for the CFRP and GFRP were similar and largely unaffected by exposure. Adhesivesused by both systems were durable. In practice, if piles were wrappe d at the time of installation, their performance would be vastly superior because the FRP would serve as a barrier to the ingress of chloride and significantly delay the onset of corrosion. Electrochemicalmeasurements clearly indicat e, however, that there are sufficient oxygen and moisture within the wrapped region to sustain the corrosion inside the wrap. This can be remedied byintegrating a cathodic protection system within the wrap. Such development work is currently underway.

ASTM D 4541, \"Standard Test Method for Pull-Off Strength of Coatings Using Portable Adhesion Te sters,\" ASTM International, West Conshohocken, Pa., 2002, 13 pp. 205Insitu Testing Introduction In terms of foundation engineering, insitu (or in place) testing refers to those methods that evaluate the performance of a geotechnical structure or the properties of the soils or rock used to support that structure. This testing can range from a soil boring at a surveyed location to monitoring the response of a fully loaded bridge pier, dam, or other foundation element. The reliability of a given structure to function as designed is directly dependent on the quality of the information obtained from such testing. Therein, it is imperative that the design engineer be familiar with the types of tests and the procedures for proper execution as well as the associated advantages and disadvantages. Methods of insitu evaluation can be invasive or noninvasive, destructive or nondestructive, and may or may not recover a specimen for visual confirmation or laboratory testing. Invasive tests (e.g. soil borings or penetration tests) tend to be more time consuming, costly, and precise; whereas, noninvasive tests (e.g. GPR or siesmic refraction) provide a large amount of information in a short period of time that is typically less quantifiable. However, when used collectively, the two methods can complement each other by: (1) defining areas of concern from noninvasive techniques, and (2) determining the foundation design parameter from invasive techniques. This is particularly advantageous on large sites where extreme variations in soil strata may exist. Site Exploration Plan The subsurface investigation program for a given site should account for the type, size, and importance of the proposed structure. These parameters help focus the design of the site exploration program by determining the quantity and depth of soil soundings (or borings) required. Planning for a site investigation should also include the location of underground utilities (i.e. phone, power, gas, etc.). As such, a local \"call before you dig\" service should be notified several days prior to the anticipated investigation. These services are usually subsidized by the various local utilities and have no associated cost. The quantity of borings is largely dependent on the overall acreage of the project, the number of foundations, or the intended use of the site. For foundations, the depth of borings depends on the zone of soil influenced by the foundation geometry and the given loading. For instance, a proposed roadway alignment typically requires a hand-auger investigation every 100 feet along the centerline to a depth of 5 feet to define uniformity of the subgrade material as well as spatial variability. Therein, the importance of the structure, in the form of causal effects should a failure occur, is somewhat minimal. Further, if undesirable soils conditions were identified, a followup investigation could be requested. In contrast, preliminary borings along the alignment of a proposed bridge foundation can be more frequent and are much deeper depending on the depth to a suitable bearing strata. At a minimum, one boring should be performed at each pier location to a depth 3 - 5 foundation diameters below the anticipated foundation. Likewise, buildings with large column loads \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 206often require a boring at each column location unless the soil shows extremely consistent behavior. For extremely important structures the designer and/or client not only require more scrutiny from the subsurface investigation, but also require an amplification factor (or importance factor) be applied to the load to assure a low probability of failure (AASHTO, 1997). In virtually all cases, the additional cost of more thorough subsurface investigation can be reconciled with a more cost effective foundation design. Uncertainty in subsurface conditions in most instances promotes needless over-design. Depending on the type of design to be considered, the designer must recognize the effect of site variability as well as the type of testing that can be conducted to increase confidence and reduce the probability of failure. \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 207Geophysical Testing Methods Ground Penetrating Radar Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a geophysical exploration tool used to provide a graphical cross- section of subsurface conditions. This cross-sectional view is created from the reflections of repeated short-duration electromagnetic (EM) waves which are generated by an antenna in contact with the ground surface as the antenna traverses across the ground surface. The reflections occur at the interfaces between materials with differing electrical properties. The electrical property from which variations cause these reflections is the dielectric permittivity, which is directly related to the electrical conductivity of the material. GPR is commonly used to identify underground utilities, underground storage tanks, buried debris, or geological features. The information from GPR can be used to make recommendations for more invasive techniques such as borings. Figure 1 shows a ground launch GPR system being pushed along a predetermined transect line. The greater the electrical contrast between the surrounding earth materials and the target of interest, the greater the amplitude of the reflected return signal. Unless the buried object/target of interest is highly conductive, only part of the signal energy is reflected back to the antenna located on the ground surface with the remaining portion of the signal continuing to propagate downward to be reflected by deeper features. If there is little or no electrical contrast between the target of interest and the surrounding earth materials, it would be very difficult if not impossible to identify the object using GPR. Figure 1 GPR field device (Courtesy of Universal Engineering, Inc.). \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 208The GPR unit consists of a set of integrated electronic components which transmits high frequency (100 to 1500 megahertz [MHz]) electromagnetic waves into the ground and records the energy reflected back to the ground surface. The GPR system is comprised of an antenna, which serves as both a transmitter and receiver, and a profiling recorder that both processes the data and provides a graphical display of the data. The depth of penetration of the GPR is very site specific and is controlled by two primary factors: subsurface soil conditions and antenna frequency. The GPR signal is attenuated (absorbed) as it passes through earth materials. As the energy of the GPR signal is diminished due to attenuation, the energy of the reflected waves is reduced, eventually to a level where the reflections can no longer be detected. In general, the more conductive the earth materials, the greater the GPR signal attenuation. In Florida, typical soil conditions which severely limit the GPR signal penetration are near-surface clays, organic materials, and the presence of sea water in the soil pore water space. A GPR survey is conducted along survey lines (transects) which are measured paths along which the GPR antenna is moved. Known reference points (i.e., building corners, driveways, etc.) are placed on a master map, which includes traces of the GPR transects overlying the survey geometry. This survey map allows for correlation between the GPR data and the position of the GPR antenna on the ground. For geological characterization surveys, the GPR survey is conducted along a set of perpendicularly oriented transects. The survey is conducted in two directions because subsurface features are often asymmetric for residential surveys. Spacing between the survey lines is initially set at 10 feet. More closely spaced grids may be used to further characterize a recorded anomaly. The features observed on the GPR data that are most commonly associated with potential sinkhole activity are: A down-warping of GPR reflector sets, that are associated with suspected lithological contacts, towards a common center. Such features typically have a bowl or funnel shaped configuration and are often associated with deflection of overlying sediment horizons caused by the migration of sediments into voids in the underlying limestone (Figure 2). In addition, buried depressions caused by differential subsidence over buried organic deposits and debris may also cause these observed features. A localized significant increase in the depth of penetration and/or amplitude of the GPR signal response. The increase in GPR signal penetration depth or amplitude is often associated with a localized increase in sand content at depth. An apparent discontinuity in GPR reflector sets that are associated with suspected lithological contacts. The apparent discontinuities and/or disruption of the GPR reflector sets may be associated with the downward migration of sediments. \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 209The greater the severity of the above features or a combination of these features, the greater the likelihood that the identified feature is related to past or present sinkhole activity. Depth estimates to the top of the lithological contacts or targets of interest are derived by dividing the time of travel of the GPR signal from the ground surface to the top of the feature by the velocity of the GPR signal. The velocity of the GPR signal is usually obtained for a given geographic area and earth material from published sources. In general, the accuracy of the GPR-derived depth estimates ranges from \u00b125 percent of the total depth. Although the GPR is very useful in locating significant lithologic soil changes, strata thickness, and inferred subsurface anomalies, the GPR cannot identify the nature of earth materials nor their condition (i.e., loose vs. dense sand, soft vs. stiff clay). The GPR data is best used in conjunction with other geotechnical and physical tests to constrain the interpretation of the virtual cross-section profiles.

These changes in electrical properties can result from variations in lithology, water content, pore-water chemistry, and the presence of buried debris. The method involves transmitting an electric current into the ground between two electrodes and measuring the voltage between two other electrodes. The direct measurement is an apparent resistivity of the area beneath the electrodes that includes deeper layers as the electrode spacing is increased. The spacing of electrodes can be increased about a central point, resulting in a vertical electric sounding (VES) that is modeled to create a 1-D geoelectric cross-section. Recent advances in technology allow for rapid collection of adjacent multiple soundings along a transect that are modeled to create a 2-D geoelectric pseudo cross-section. The cross-section is useful for mapping both the vertical and horizontal variations in the subsurface (see Figure 3). Although the result from this method are not absolute, the resistivity trends obtained are useful for mapping stratigraphy such as aquatards, bedrock, faults and or fractures. It can delineate anomalous formations or voids in karstic material, the presence of salt water intrusion in coastal regions, and detect leaks in dams as well as other applications. It is most successful in large cleared areas without severe changes in topography; not recommended for small congested or urban sites. Buried utilities or other highly conductive anomalies can adversely affect the results. This method is fast, non-invasive, and relatively inexpensive when compared to drilling. When compared to electromagnetic methods, is it less susceptible to interference from overhead power lines. It is easily calibrated to existing boreholes to allow for correlations between measured resistivity and estimated soil properties. As with other geophysical test methods, it is best suited for environmental or water resources disciplines that require stratigraphy or soil property mapping of large land parcels.

(ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 211Seismic Refraction The seismic refraction technique measures the seismic velocity of subsurface materials and models the depth to interfaces with a velocity increase. Soil conditions and geologic structure are inferred from the results, since changes in material type, or soil conditions, are often associated with changes in seismic velocity. Seismic energy, which is introduced into the subsurface using a drop weight or explosive source, propagates through the earth as a wave front that is refracted by the material through which it passes. As illustrated in Figure 4, the wave front intersects a high-velocity interface, creating a \"head wave\" that travels in the higher velocity material nearly parallel to the interface. The energy in this head wave leaves the interface and passes back through the low velocity material to the surface. Geophones placed at selected intervals along the ground surface detect the ground motion and send an electrical signal, via a cable, to a recording seismograph. The objective is to determine the arrival times of these refracted waves in order to calculate the velocity of the material and model the depth to various interfaces. This test is used to determine stratigraphy such as the depth to bedrock. It is best suited for stratigraphy that increases in density (or seismic velocity) with depth. In such cases it can estimate the depth of borrow materials, aid in mapping faults and fractured rock zones, locate the water table, estimate material elastic properties such as shear modulus and Poisson's ratio. The depth of exploration is limited by the energy source and the maximum length of geophone spacing. The test is less expensive most soil exploration methods as well as other comparable seismic reflection methods. The vertical resolution is usually better than electrical, magnetic or gravity methods of site investigation.

(ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 212Physical Sampling and Penetration Tests Standard Penetration Test The standard penetration test (SPT) is undoubtedly the most common method of soil exploration for foundation design. It is an invasive test that not only provides information from which soil strength can be estimated, but also it provides a physical sample that can be visually inspected or used for laboratory classification. Although the test method has undergone several iterations with respect to upgrading equipment, it is sensitive to operator and equipment variability. Regardless, the general concept of penetration resistance and the hands on soil sample recovery make it the choice of many designers. The SPT is described by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) as test number D-1586, entitled \"Standard Method for Penetration Test and Split-Barrel Sampling of Soils.\" This standard defines the appropriate manner in which the test should be conducted which involves drilling techniques, penetration and sampling methods, proper equipment, and the reporting of results. In general, a 2\" O.D. split spoon sampler is driven into the ground with a 140 lb drop hammer dropped 30 inches repeatedly until a penetration of 18 inches is achieved . The number of blows of the hammer is recorded for each of three 6\" intervals (totaling 18 inches). The number of blows required to advance the sampler the last 12 inches (2 and 3 interval) is defined as the SPTnd rd N-value. Upon extraction of the sampler, the soil retrieved is visually inspected, documented, and placed in jars for more elaborate testing (if so determined by the engineer). At best, continuous sampling produces a single SPT N-value every 1.5 ft. At minimum, a sample should be taken every 5 feet of depth. Between each penetration test, a boring should be advanced to permit the next sample without interference from side shear resistance along the length of the drill rod. Several boring techniques are acceptable: one-hole rotary drilling, continuous flight hollow stem augering, wash boring, or continuous flight solid stem augering. However, under no circumstances should the soil beneath the advanced borehole be disturbed by jetting or suction action caused by improper drilling techniques. For instance, extracting a continuous flight auger from submerged soils will reduce the insitu stresses and produce lower N-values. The hammer used to drive the sampler can either be manual or automatic. Numerous configurations of both hammer types have been manufactured. The safety type is the most common manual hammer as it is equally suited to both drive and extract the split spoon. This type of hammer is lifted by the friction developed between a rope and a spinning cathead power take-off. The number of wraps around the cathead as well as the diameter of cathead are specified as well as the condition of the rope and cathead surface (Figure 5). Due to the incomplete release of the drop weight from the cathead, the total potential energy of the drop is not available to advance the sampler. A recent study showed that manual hammers transfer anywhere between 39 and 93% of the energy (average 66%), while automatic hammers ranged between 52 and 98% (average 79%). Although the reproducibility of a automatic hammer is better than manual hammers, the variation in energy efficiency cited is dependent on the upward velocity of the hammer as controlled by the revolutions per minute of the drive chain motor (Figure 6). To this end, a given machine should be calibrated to produce an exact 30 inch drop height and the rpms required to produce that drop recorded and maintained. \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M.

(ed), CRC Press, Taylor Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 214Aside fr om the visual and physical classification that can be obtained from a standard penetration test, correlations have been established that provide estimates of insitu soil properties based on the soil type and blow count. These correlations can be based on the corrected or uncorrected SPT blow count N' or N, respectively. Corrected blow counts provide a method of accounting for the insitu state of stress surrounding a soil sample while it was being tested. For instance, sands with identical structure with appear stronger (higher blow counts) at greater depths than when at shallower depths. As such, soil properties such as unit weight may be better estimated if overburden effects are removed or normalized. However, soil properties such as shear strength or available end bearing are enhanced by greater insitu stresses and are generally correlated to uncorrected blow counts. The following expression is used to correct SPT N-values by normalizing it to a 1 tsf overburden insitu state. Tables SPT-1 and SPT-2 provide estimated values for corrected and uncorrected blow counts, respectively.

When sufficient samples are recovered, laboratory tests t can be conducted to determine the splitting tensile strength, q, (ASTM D 3967) and the unconfined us u compressive strength, q,(ASTM D 2938). The shear strength of the shaft/limestone interface, f tu , is then expressed as a function of q and q (McVay et al., 1992). This value is typically adjusted by rock quality indicators such as the Rock Quality Designation, RQD , (ASTM D 6032) and/or the percent recovery, REC . For example, the State of Florida outlines a method using the percent recovery to offset the highly variable strength properties of the Florida limestone formation. su DESIGN su Therein, a design value, (f ) , is expressed as REC * f(Lai, 1999). These methods work well in consistent, competent rock but are subject to coring techniques, available equipment, and driller experience. Sampling problems are compounded in low quality rock formations as evidenced by the occurrence of zero RQD and low REC values. Timed Drilling. To counter poor quality samples (or no sample at all) some designers with extensive local experience use timed drilling techniques to estimate rock quality and shaft design values in addition to, or in lieu of, the previous methods. With this technique, the driller must record the time to advance a wash boring through a bearing strata while maintaining a constant \"crowd\" pressure, fluid flow, and rotational bit speed. Advance times would typically need to be greater than 2 - 3 minutes per foot to be useful. Lower advance times are common in weaker soils which are more effectively tested by Standard Penetration Testing. Like SPT and CPT, the equipment should maintain reasonably consistent physical dimensions (i.e. the bit should stay in good working condition). Although this method is very simple, it is highly empirical and largely dependent on the uniformity of the drilling techniques. Additionally, the designer must have developed a large enough database (with load test calibration) to design with confidence. Such databases exist, but are proprietary and not common knowledge. Coring Methods. When designing from rock core samples it is important to consider the factors affecting sample retrieval and hence their quality. The recovered samples can range in diameter from 0.845\" to 6\" where larger samples are preferred in soft limestone. The State of Florida requires a minimum core diameter of 2.4\" but recommends 4\". The drill core samples can be obtained from three different types of core barrels: single tube, double tube, and triple tube. The simplest is the single tube in which the drill core and flushing fluid occupy the same space and consequently can lead to erosion of low strength or fragmented rock samples. As a result, this type of core barrel is not permitted for use with Florida limestone (FDOT, 1999). \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 217Figure 7 Double tube core barrel schematic (after Wittke, 1990) . Figure 8 Single tube (left), double tube w/rotating inner tube (center),and double tube w/fixed inner tube (right), after Wittke, 1990 .Double tube core barrels differ from single tube by essentially isolating the drill core from the flushing fluid (see Figure 7). Simple versions of this type of core barrel use a rotating inner tube which requires a small fraction ( approx. 10%) of the drilling fluid to circulate around the drill core to prevent binding and direct contact of the sample with the tube. Most double tube systems now use a fixed inner tube which requires no flush fluid around the drill core and thus causes less disturbance to the sample. During extraction of the entire barrel assembly, a core trap-ring at the leading edge of the inner barrel snares the drill core preventing its loss (see Figure 8). Recovering the sample from the inner tube without disturbing it is difficult in soft, fragmented, or inter-layered rock deposits. Both fixed and rotating inner core barrels are permitted by FDOT but significant variations in recovery values should be expected. The triple tube core barrel, in concept, is essentially the same as the double tube (with the fixed \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 218inner tube). It differs in the way the specimen is recovered in that the inner tube is fitted with yet a third sleeve or split tubes in which the drill core is housed. The entire sleeve or split tube is extruded from the inner barrel using a plunger and pressure fitting that pushes directly on the split tubes. The extrusion process is similar to that of Shelby tube samples except the sample is not stressed. In this manner, the sample is not compressed or shaken loose. Figures 9-12 show the components of the triple tube core barrel and sample extruder. Figure 10 Sample extruder. Figure 11 Cutting bits used by FDOT District I. Figure 9 Triple tube core barrel components. \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 219Further variables affecting core drilling results include: the type of drill bit, the flow rate of the flushing fluid, the end gap between the inner and outer barrels, the crowd pressure, and the advance rate through softer inter-layered deposits. With so many variables controlling sample recovery, methods of investigating the remaining borehole for the insitu limestone characteristics could have significant merit. Insitu Rock Strength Tests. Direct measurements of the insitu bond/shear strength of the drilled shaft-to-rock interface can be obtained through small-scale anchor pull-out tests or full-scale load tests. Anchor pull-out tests are purported to have produced reasonable correlations with full-scale results (Bloomquist et al., 1991). The test method involves simply grouting a high strength post tensioning rod into a borehole, and measuring the load required to pull the grout plug free (Note: load is directly applied to the base of the plug to produce compression and the associated Poisson expansion in the specimen) . Attention must be given to the surface area formed by the volume of grout actually placed. This test is an attractive option in that it is relatively inexpensive, requires minimal equipment mobilization, and can be conducted at numerous locations throughout a site. However, it has received little attention as a whole and remains comparatively unused. Design-phase, full-scale, insitu testing of the shaft/limestone interface is by far the surest method to determine the design parameters of a drilled shaft. This can be accomplished by several means: top down static loading, bi-directional static loading, statnamic loading, or drop-hammer dynamic loading (discussed later). However, due to the associated costs, only a small fraction of rock sockets are tested in this fashion, and rarely at the design phase. Additionally, a single test may not adequately account for the spatial variability of rock formations without correlation to standard site investigation methods. As such, a host of insitu borehole devices have been developed to aid in estimating soil and rock strength parameters.

(ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 220Figure 13 Loading types of modulus devices.Insitu borehole modulus devices are classified into two categories based on their loading apparatus: (1) rotationally symmetric borehole loading devices, and (2) diametrically arranged lateral loading plates (Wittke, 1990). Figure 13 shows the loading scheme of the two conceptual mechanisms. Type (1) probes apply load via a rubber diaphragm which is pressurized by either gas or liquid. In general, measurements of displacement are made directly when using gas pressure, and indirectly through change in volume when using fluid pressure. Table 1 lists Type (1) devices that have been developed by various manufacturers. Type (2) probes use two semi-cylindrical thrust plates diametrically aligned to apply loads to the arc of the borehole. Measurements of displacement are obtained directly at a minimum of two locations along the longitudinal axis of the plates. Whereas Type (1) devices produce uniformly distributed radial stresses in the borehole, the stress distribution in Type (2) devices is dependent on the relative stiffness of the rock and the plate. Table 2 lists Type (2) devices that have been developed by various manufacturers. \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M.

The test scheme for this device is a combination of both the anchor pull-out test and the borehole modulus test. The device is expanded into the walls of the borehole and is then pulled to determine the shear strength of the soil. Typically, several lateral pressures are investigated (Demartinecourt, 1985). \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 223Cone Penetration Test The cone penetration test (CPT) is an invasive soil test that defines soil strata type, soil properties, and strength parameters. It is highly repeatable, insensitive to operators, and best suited for uncemented soils, sands, or clay. Although this test retrieves no sample for laboratory testing or visual inspection, it has the capability of producing enormous amounts of physical information based on correlations with side-by-side tests with other test methods such as SPT. Further, as the test provides direct measurements of ultimate end bearing and side shear, it is directly applicable for design of foundations of all kinds. The CPT is described in ASTM test number D-3441, entitled \"Standard Test Method for Deep, Quasi-Static, Cone and Friction-Cone Penetration Tests of Soil.\" This is to include cone penetration type tests that use mechanical or electronic load detection, tip or tip and friction stress delineation, and those tests where the penetration into the soil is slow and steady in a vertically aligned orientation. Those tests conducted with mechanical load detection are typically denoted as Dutch Cone Tests and those using electronic detection are simply called Cone Penetration Tests. The term \"quasi-static\" refers to a steady rate of penetration where the acceleration is zero, but the velocity of penetration is constant (1 - 2 cm/sec \u00b1 25%). The test apparatus consists of a 60 degree conical tip of known cross-sectional area that is thrust into the soil at a near constant rate. Behind the cone tip, a friction sleeve of known surface area is also included that is used to detect the side shear or adhesion between the steel sleeve and the surrounding soil. The force required to advance the tip through the soil is divided by the cross-sectional area to c determine the tip stress, q . Similarly, the force required to advance the friction sleeve is divided by s the sleeve surface area to produce the local friction value, f. The tip area and sleeve area vary from device to device but the most common areas are 10 cm and 150 cm , respectively. 2 2 c The tip area (diameter) can influence the magnitude of the resulting q value similar to the effects of foundation diameter on capacity. This is due to the increased zone of influence beneath the tip as the cone diameter increases for various devices. Therefore, in relative uniform soils, the tip diameter has little effect. In layered or more heterogeneous strata, a smaller tip diameter will better register the minute changes in soil type and strength. Larger diameter cones physically average the effects of thin layers. Figure 14 shows two different-sized cone tip and sleeve assemblies. Figure 14 Two cone tip and sleeve assemblies of different sizes. \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 224Another feature that CPT equipment usually incorporate is the capability of monitoring the pore water pressure while advancing the cone/sleeve assembly. There can be a significant amount of excess pore pressure developed by forcing the volume of the cone into a somewhat fixed volume of a poorly draining material. In contrast, in dense fine-grained soils, the cavity expansion can cause a decrease pore pressure. The assemblies shown in Figure 14have a pressure transducer within the tip body that registers the pore pressure directly behind the tip (between the tip and sleeve). This information can be used to convert the total stress registered by the tip to effective stress similar to a consolidated undrained triaxial compression test. When pore pressure measurements are taken the test is denoted as CPTU. Smaller cones tend to induce less cavity expansion and therefore less effects on total stress. The thrust required to advance the cone assembly is dependent on the strength of the soil as well as the size of the tip. Given the disparity between the cone sizes in Figure 14, it is not surprising that the size of the equipment required to advance these cones is also disparate. Figure 15 shows the associated truck mounted CPT rigs that use these devices. The larger diameter cone requires a 20 ton thrust mechanism and can reach depths of 100 meters; the mini-cone requires about 1/5 the thrust and can be mounted on the front of a standard truck or utility vehicle. Mini-CPTs are limited to a practical maximum depth 20 meters. The thrust mechanisms also vary between the two systems in Figure 15. The standard CPT system uses 1 meter segmental rods to advance the cone tip/sleeve assembly. The thrusting ram is designed to grip, thrust downward 1 meter, release and stroke upward 1 meter, re-grip and repeat. At a penetration rate of 2 cm / sec, the process progresses at an average advance rate of 1 cm / sec to account for the re-gripping. An average sounding to 30 meters should take on the order of 1.5 - 2 hours (in and out). A SPT to a similar depth could take multiple days. The mini-cone uses a more time efficient method of advancing the cone. It uses a contiguous length of mild stainless steel tubing (10 - 20 meters long) that is continuously feed at a constant rate without having to re-stroke and re- grip. Therein, the tubing is straightened from a large diameter coil as it is continuously gripped by side-by-side opposing chains specially designed to mate to the coil diameter. Figure 16 shows both thrust mechanisms. Figure 15 Standard 20 ton cone truck (left); 4 ton mini-cone vehicle (right). \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 225The data collection during cone penetration testing is typically taken at 5 cm intervals but can be taken as frequent as permitted by the data acquisition system. This gives a virtually continuous sounding of tip and sleeve stresses. As both of these devices use strain gage based load cells, the instrumentation leads are routed through the center of the thrusting rod / tube. The data are processed to produce the soil type as well as other parameters in real time. The basis for the data regression is based on correlations developed by Robertson and Campanella, (1983). Although many correlations exist, the most significant uses a calculated parameter that defines the ratio of measured side to the f measured tip stress. This ratio is defined as the friction ratio, R. To aid in classifying various soils, c twelve soil types were defined that could be readily identified given the cone bearing stress, q , and f the friction ration, R . Figure 17 shows the classification chart used to identify soils from CPT data. Further, correlations from CPT to SPT test data were developed to elevate the comfort of designers c more familiar with SPT data. Therein, the q /N ratio was defined for each of the twelve soil types (also shown in Figure CPT 7).

This is particularly problematic with deep foundations that are installed without visual certainty of the actual conditions or configuration. This section will discuss several methods used to raise the confidence of the design with regards to concrete quality or capacity verification. Shaft Inspection Device (SID) The inspection device is a visual inspection system for evaluating bottom cleanliness of drilled shaft excavations. A special video camera contained in a weighted, trapped-air bell housing is lowered into the shaft excavation prior to concreting to record the condition of the bottom. This is particularly helpful in slurry excavations where quality assurance is difficult to maintain. The bell housing is outfitted with gages in clear sight of the video camera that are capable of registering the thickness of accumulated debris or sediment at the shaft excavation. The system is capable of testing shafts with depths in excess of 200 feet. Several generations of this device exist that range in size from less than a foot in diameter to over 3 feet in diameter. The inspection is viewed in realtime on a color video monitor and recorded on a standard VHS tape. Voice annotations are recorded simultaneously during the inspection process similar to standard camcorders. Crosshole Sonic Logging (CSL) Crosshole sonic logging is a geophysical test method used to determine the compression wave velocity between two parallel, water-filled tubes or slurry filled boreholes. By using two geophones (one emitting and one receiving) the sound wave arrival times can be logged at various depths within Figure 18 Miniature shaft inspection device (Courtesy of Applied Foundation Testing, Inc.) \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 228the tubes. From this information the insitu properties of the materials between the tubes can be inferred thus identifying various strata. More recently, this test has become a non-destructive method for evaluating the quality of newly placed drilled shaft concrete. Therein, the arrival times are measured between logging tubes attached peripherally to the reinforcing cage allowing concrete quality between the tubes to be assessed. As only the concrete in a direct line between the tubes can be tested, multiple access tubes can be installed. Typically, one tube for every foot of diameter is required to satisfactorily survey a representative portion of the shaft concrete. Data is viewed in the field on a special data acquisition system. Shaft Integrity Test (SIT) or Pile Integrity Test (PIT) The shaft/pile integrity test is an impact echo test that uses the reflections of anomalous cross sectional shaft or pile dimensions to determine the quality of a drilled shaft, auger-cast-in-situ or driven pile. The reflected sound waves from within the concrete are plotted as a function of arrival times which can then be correlated to the depth from which the reflection emanated. Figures SIT-1 and 2 shows the equipment used to conduct the test as well as the outputted results. This test is well-suited for determining the depth of the foundation as well as the depth to anomalous features. However, it can not determine the magnitude of anomalous features, it requires access to the pile top to minimize confounding signals, and it is generally limited to depths on the order of 50 times the pile diameter.

(ed), CRC Press, Taylor FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 229Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) During pile driving, the stresses and accelerations imparted to the pile can be monitored and recorded to assess the quality of the installation. Although this information is also used to ascertain the load carrying capability of the pile, the quality assurance associated with type of equipment is perhaps its greatest contribution. Therein, the tensile and compressive stresses in piles can be monitored via strain gage instrumentation to prevent unnecessary damage while adjusting pile driving hammer energy to maximize production rates. The movement is also monitored using integrated accelerometer data. Figure 22 shows the instrumentation and its position during pile driving.

This test is relatively simple in concept yet confirms the performance of every grouted shaft up to a lower limit of shaft capacity. During the process of tip grouting, the upward displacement, grout pressure, and grout volume are recorded. This information provides the design engineer the response of the shaft to loading. Therein, the side shear as well as the end bearing of the shaft are verified up to the level of the applied grout pressure. The product of the grout pressure and tip area produce the tip load; this preloading is afforded by an equivalent reaction from the side shear component. Therefore, the proven capacity of the shaft is established as twice the tip load. The upper limit of capacity can be shown to be on the order of 2 to 3 times the proven capacity when verified by downward load testing. The design of post grouted shafts is discussed in a later chapter. Figure PG1-2 show the standard field data obtained from every grouted shaft. Figure PG3 shows the performance for each of 76 shafts grouted on a bridge project in West Palm Beach, Florida. Figure 24 Field data used to confirm shaft performance. \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M.

(ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 233Load Testing Load testing is considered to be the best measure of foundation suitability to resist anticipated design loads. These tests involve the application of a load capable of displacing the foundation and determining its capacity from its response. Various approaches have been devised to obtain this information. When comparing these approaches, they can be sorted from simplest to most complex in the following order: static load test, rapid load test, and the dynamic load test. These categories can be delineated by comparing the duration of the loading event with respect to the axial natural period of the foundation (2L/C), where L represents the foundation length and C represents the strain wave velocity. Test durations longer than 1000 L/C are considered static loadings and those shorter than 10 L/C are consider dynamic (Janes et al., 2000; Kusakabe et.al, 2000). Tests with a duration between 10L/C and 1000 L/C are denoted as rapid load tests. The static and rapid load test will be discussed in this chapter. The dynamic load test is discussed in the pile driving and analysis chapter. Static Load Test Static load testing encompasses all test methods that systematically apply an increasing load to a foundation in multiple loading increments at such a rate so as to produce no dynamic movements as stated above. These tests include many applications (i.e. deep foundations or shallow foundations, tension or compression loads) with numerous loading configurations. With regard to full-scale insitu load tests, several test procedures are most prominent: plate load test (ASTM D 1195), pile load test in compression (ASTM D 1143), pile load test in tension (ASTM D 3689), and the Osterberg load test. Kentledge Load Test. The load from structures to the foundations can be compression (downward), tension (upward), or lateral (sideways). The downward load carrying resistance of a foundation encompasses most of the load conditions considered. In order to replicate these often enormous loads, several methodologies have been devised. The simplest form of a load test is the dead load or Kentledge method. This requires that the full test load be supplied in the form of dead weight stacked above the foundation on some framework. The framework must be capable of supporting the entire load at a single location where a hydraulic ram / jack can progressively transfer the load to the top of the foundation (Figure 26). This type of test accurately predicts the foundation response at full Kentledge load, but over estimates the stiffness of the foundation at lower loads due to the presence of the dead load overburden pressure applied to the ground surface. The practical upper limit of these tests is approximately 400 tons although physical site constraints may extend or restrict this limit drastically. Further, these tests are the most expensive and time consuming to perform from the standpoint of setup requirements. As with all static load tests, these tests are typically run in compliance with ASTM D-1143 or similar standard. Anchored Load Tests. Static load tests with anchored reaction systems are the most common of the static load tests. These tests supply the full load to the foundation via a series of tension anchors (or adjacent deep foundations) in conjunction with a beam or truss (Figure 27). The beam must resist the load applied to the foundation by transferring it the reaction anchors which are preferably no closer than 5 diameters of the foundation (center to center spacing). The reaction anchors must not displace significantly while developing the required load. Excessive upward movement from these anchors can alter the stress field surrounding the foundation being tested and decrease the resultant \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 234ultimate capacity. Due to the constraints in designing such a reaction system, rarely does an anchored static load test exceed 1500 tons. However, anchored tests as large as 3500 tons are commonplace in some parts of the world. The analysis of static load testing requires no more than plotting the load versus displacement response. As every foundation application can have a unique failure criteria, the design engineer must decide at what displacement the foundation capacity should be determined. In some instances this is based on a given fraction of ultimate load. In other cases, it may be based upon the some displacement offset method such as the Davisson Method or the FHWA method. With LRFD-type approaches, a fraction of the ultimate capacity is compared to the factored design load in a strength limit state, and displacement is considered separately in a service limit state. Figure 28 shows typical static load test results and three common approaches to determining capacity (a) a maximum permissible displacement usually set by structural sensitivity, (b) displacement offset method, and (c) the load at which additional displacement is obtained without increase in load.

The O-cell is a sacrificial jack which the Engineer installs at the bottom of a pile or drilled shaft. It provides a static load and requires no overhead load frame or other external reaction system (Figure 29). The O-cell is easily installed in drilled shafts using common construction equipment and is attached to the tip of a driven pile before driving. Installation methods on a drilled shaft can vary, but the following procedures are typical. An O- cell or O-cells are attached to a top and bottom steel plate, which is then placed near or at the bottom of a shaft as part of the reinforcing cage or carrying frame (Figure 30). Strain gage instruments are also attached to the assembly and all wires are channeled to the surface via the cage or beam. The complete assembly is then lifted and set into the open shaft prior to the concreting process. In the case of multi-level O-cell assemblies, or placement of the O-cell off the bottom of the shaft, a tremie pipe is fed through a prefabricated hole in the steel plates to ensure proper cementation below the O-cells. Figure 29 Section view of the bidirectional loading scheme of an O Cell (Courtesy of LoadTest, Inc). \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 237Once the concrete has reached required strength the O-cell is pressurized. The O-cell uses the soil system for reaction, eliminating the need for overhead or external reaction systems. The O-cell is expanded until the expansion force is some desired proof multiple of the design loading, or one of the two components, side friction or end bearing, reaches some defined failure condition, or the cell reaches its maximum expansion. Depending on the shaft diameter, O-cells can be grouped together on a single plane to increase the effective load. Testing is typically performed following the ASTM Quick Test Method D1143 (ASTM, 1993). Instrumentation used to measure load and deflection is similar to instrumentation used for conventional load tests. At the completion of the test the cell can be filled with grout to reestablish its integrity and permit the test shaft or pile to become a production shaft or pile. The O-cell loads the test pile in compression similar to a conventional static load test. Data from an O-cell test is therefore analyzed much the same way as conventional static test data. The only significant difference is that the O-cell provides two load-versus-movement curves, one for shaft Figure 30 O Cell and cage lifted for installation (Courtesy of LoadTest, Inc.). \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 238resistance and one for toe resistance (Figure 31). The failure load for each component may be determined from these curves using a failure criteria similar to that recommended for conventional load tests. To determine the shaft resistance capacity, the buoyant weight of the pile should be subtracted from the upward O-cell load. Analysis for the toe resistance should not include elastic deformation since the load is applied directly. The engineer may further utilize the component curves to construct an equivalent pile head load- deflection curve and investigate the overall pile capacity. If the pile is then assumed rigid, the pile head and toe move together and have the same deflection at this load. By adding the shaft resistance to the mobilized toe resistance at the chosen deflection, a single point on the equivalent pile head load curve is determined. Additional points may then be calculated to develop the curve up to the maximum deflection (or maximum extrapolated deflection) of the component that did not fail. Points beyond the maximum deflection of the non-failing component may also be obtained by conservatively assuming that at greater deflections if remains constant at the maximum applied load. An O-cell test can be performed on types of shafts and piles, including; pre-cast, open-ended pipe piles, mandrel driven piles, and has been used on large diameter drilled shafts. O-cells can be used to test deep foundations over water or confined areas because the O-cell test does not require an overhead reaction system. An O-cell test may be applied in many situations due to the systems flexibility, e.g. placement of the O-cell within the shaft may be altered, or additional layers of O- cells may be used to isolate significant soil zones.

(ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 239Rapid Load Test Since its inception in1988, the inertia loading technology called Statnamic testing has gained popularity with many designers largely due to its time efficiency, cost effectiveness, data quality, and flexibility in testing existing foundations. Where large capacity static tests may take up to a week to set up and conduct, the largest of Statnamic tests (3500 tons) typically takes no more than a few days. Further, multiple smaller-capacity tests (up to 2000 tons) can easily be completed within a day. The direct benefit of this time efficiency is the cost savings to the client and the ability to conduct more tests within a given budget. Additionally, this test method has boosted quality assurance by giving the contractor the ability to test foundations thought to have been compromised by construction difficulties without significantly affecting production and without requiring previous planning for its testing. Statnamic testing is designated as a rapid load test that uses the inertia of a relatively small reaction mass instead of a reaction structure to produce large forces. The duration of the Statnamic test is typically 100 to 120 milliseconds, but is dependant on the ratio of the applied force to the weight of the reaction mass. Longer duration tests of up to 500 milliseconds are possible but require more reaction mass. The Statnamic force is produced by quickly-formed high pressure gases that in turn launch a reaction mass upward at up to twenty times the acceleration of gravity. The equal and opposite force exerted on the foundation is simply the product of the mass and acceleration of the reaction mass. It should be noted that the acceleration of the reaction mass is not significant in the analysis of the foundation; it is simply a by-product of the test. Secondly, the load produced is not an impact in that the mass is in contact prior to the test. Further, the test is over long before the masses reach the top of their flight. The parameters of interest are only those associated with the movement of the foundation (i.e. force, displacement, and acceleration). Figure 32 shows the setup for both an axial compression and lateral statnamic test setup. Figure 32 Axial statnamic test setup (left), lateral statnamic test in progress (right). \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor FL pp.47-86. 240(1)Analysis Proc edures. Typical analysis of Statnamic data relies on measured values of force, displacement and acceleration. A soil model is not required, hence, the results are not highly user dependent. The Statnamic forcing event induces foundation motion in a relatively short period of time and hence acceleration and velocities will be present. The accelerations are typically small(1- 2 g's), however the enormous mass of the foundation when accelerated resists movement due to inertia and as such the fundamental equation of motion applies, Equation 1. where, F = forcing event m = mass of the foundation a = acceleration of the displacing body v = velocity of the displacing body c = viscous damping coefficient k = spring constant of the displacing system x = displacement of the body The equation of motion is generally described using four terms: forcing, inertial, viscous damping, and stiffness. The forcing term ( F) denotes the load application which varies with time and is equated to the sum of remaining three terms. The inertial term ( ma) is the force which is generated from the tendency of a body to resist motion, or to keep moving once it is set in motion (Young, 1992). The viscous damping term ( cv) is best described as the velocity dependant resistance to movement. The final term ( kx), represents the classic system stiffness, which is the static soil resistance. When this equation is applied to a pile/soil system the terms can be redefined to more accurately describe the system. This is done by including both measured and calculated terms. The revised equation is displayed below: Statnamic where, F is the measured Statnamic force, m is the calculated mass of the foundation, a is the measured acceleration of the foundation, c is the viscous damping coefficient , v is the static calculated velocity, and F is the derived pile/soil static response. static There are two unknowns in the revised equation F and c, thus the equation is under specified. staticF is the desired value, so the variable c must be obtained to solve the equation. Middendorp (1992) presented a method to calculate the damping coefficient referred to as the Unloading Point Method (UP). With the value of c known, the static force can be calculated. This force, termed \"Derived Static,\" represents an equivalent soil response similar to that produced by a traditional static load test. Unloading Point Method. The UP is a simple method by which the damping coefficient can be determined from the measured Statnamic data. It uses a simple single degree of freedom model to represent the foundation/soil system as a rigid body supported by a non-linear spring and a Static linear dashpot in parallel (see Figure 32). The spring represents the static soil response ( F )(2) \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 241which includes the elastic response of the foundation as well as the foundation/soil interface and surrounding soil response. The dashpot is used to represent the dynamic resistance which depends on the rate of pile penetration (Nishimura, 1995). The UP makes two primary assumptions in its determination of \"c.\" The first is the static capacity of the pile is constant when it plunges as a rigid body. The second is that the damping coefficient is constant throughout the test. By doing so a time window is defined in which to calculate the damping coefficient as shown in Figure 33. This figure shows a typical Statnamic load- displacement curve which denotes points (1) and (2). The first point of interest (1) is that of maximum Statnamic Force. At this point the static resistance is assumed to have become steady state, for the purpose of calculating \"c\". Thus, any extra resistance is attributed to that of the dynamic forces (ma and cv). The next point of interest (2) is that of zero velocity which has been termed the \"Unloading Point.\" At this point theFigure 34 UP time window for c determination. Figure 33 Single D.O.F.

(ed), CRC Press, Taylor Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 242(3)foundation is no longe r moving and the resistance due to damping is zero. The static resistance, used to calculate \"c\" from point (1) to (2), can then be calculated by the following equation: Statnamic Static UP Where, F , m, and a are all known parameters; F is the static force calculated at (2) and assumed constant from (1) to (2). Next, the damping coefficient can be calculated throughout this range, from maximum force (1) to zero velocity (2). The following equation is used to calculate c: Damping values over this range should be fairly constant. Often the average value is taken as the damping constant, but if a constant value occurs over a long period of time it should be used (see Figure 34). Note that as v approaches zero at point (2), values of c can be different from that of the most representative value and therefore the entire trend should be reviewed. Finally the derived static response can be calculated as follows: Currently software is available to the public that can be used in conjunction with Statnamic test data to calculate the derived static pile capacity using the UP Method (Garbin, 1999). This software was developed by the University of South Florida and the Federal HighwayF igure 35 Variation in c between times (1) and (2).

(ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 243Administration and can gmullins under the Statnamic~ Analysis Workbook (SAW) heading. The UP has proven to be a valuable tool in predicting damping values when the foundation acts as a rigid body. However, as the pile length increases an appreciable delay can be introduced between the movement of the pile top and toe, hence negating the rigid body assumption. This occurrence also becomes prevalent when an end bearing condition exists; in this case the lower portion of the foundation is prevented from moving jointly with the top of the foundation. w Middendorp (1995) defines the \"Wave Number\" (N ) to quantify the applicability of the UP. The wave number is calculated by dividing the wave length (D) by the foundation depth (L). D is obtained by multiplying the wave speed c in length per second by the load duration (T) in seconds. Thus, the wave number is calculated by the following equation: Through empirical studies Middendorp determined that the UP would predict accurately the static capacity from Statnamic data, if the wave number was greater than 12. Nishimura (1995) established a similar threshold at a wave number of 10. Using wave speeds of 5000 m/s and 4000 m/s for steel and concrete respectively and a typical Statnamic load duration, the UP is limited to piles shorter than 50 m (steel) and 40 m (concrete). Wave number analysis can be used to determine if stress waves will develop in the pile. However, this does not necessarily satisfy the rigid body requirement of the UP. Statnamic tests cannot always produce wave numbers greater than 10, and as such there have been several methods suggested to accommodate stress wave phenomena in Statnamically tested long piles (Middendorp, 1995). Due to limitations on paper length these methods are not presented. Modified Unloading Point Method. Given the limitations of the UP, users of Statnamic testing have developed a remedy for the problematic condition that arises most commonly. The scenario w involves relatively short piles (N >10) that do not exhibit rigid body motion, but rather elastically shorten within the same magnitude as the permanent set. This is typical of rock-socketed drilled shafts or piles driven to dense bearing strata that are not fully mobilized during testing. The consequence is that the top of pile response (i.e. acceleration, velocity, and displacement) is significantly different from that of the toe. The most drastic subset of these test results show zero movement at the toe while the top of pile elastically displaces in excess of the surficial yield limit (e.g. upwards of 25 mm). Whereas with plunging piles (rigid body motion) the difference in movement (top to toe) is minimal and the average acceleration is essentially the same as the top of pile acceleration; tip restrained piles will exhibit an inertial term that is twice as large when using top of pile movement measurements to represent the entire pile. The Modified Unloading Point Method (MUP), developed by Justason (1997), makes use of an additional toe accelerometer that measures the toe response. The entire pile is still assumed to be a single mass, m, but the acceleration of the mass is now defined by the average of the top and toe movements. A standard UP is then conducted using the applied top of pile Statnamic force and(6) \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor FL accelerations and velocities. The derived static force is then plotted versus the top of pile displacement as before. This simple extension of the UP has successfully overcome most problematic data sets. Plunging piles instrumented with both top and toe accelerometers have shown little analytical difference between the UP and the MUP. However, MUP analyses are now recommended whenever both top and toe information is available. Although the MUP provided a more refined approach to some of the problems associated with UP conditions, there still exists a scenario where it is difficult to interpret Statnamic data with present methods. This is when the wave number is less than ten (relatively long piles). In these cases the pile may still only experience compression (no tension waves) but the delay between top and toe movements causes a phase lag. Hence an average of top and toe movements does not adequately represent the pile. SUP Method. The fundamental concept of the Segmental Unloading Point (SUP) method is that the acceleration, velocity, displacement, and force from each segment of a pile can be determined using strain gage measurements along the length of the pile (Mullins, et al., 2002). Individual pile segment displacements are determined using the relative displacement as calculated from strain gage measurements and an upper or lower measured displacement. The velocity and acceleration of each segment are then determined by numerically differentiating displacement then velocity with respect to time. The segmental forces are determined by calculating the difference in force from two strain gage levels. Typically the maximum number of segments is dependent on the available number of strain gage layers. However, strain gage placement does not necessitate assignment of segmental boundaries; as long as the wave number of a given segment is greater than 10, the segment can include several strain gage levels within its boundaries. The number and the elevation of strain gage levels are usually determined based on soil stratification; as such, it can be useful to conduct an individual segmental analysis to produce the shear strength parameters for each soil strata. A reasonable upper limit on the number of segments should be adopted because of the large number of mathematical computations required to complete each analysis. Figure 36 is a sketch of the SUP pile discretization. \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 245The notation used for the general SUP case defines the pile as having m levels of strain gages and m+1 segments. Strain gage locations are labeled using positive integers starting from 1 and continuing through m . The first gage level below the top of the foundation is denoted as GL1 where the superscript defines the gage level. Although there are no strain gages at the top of foundation,this elevation is denoted as GL. Segments are numbered using positive integers from0 1 to m+1 , where segment 1 is bounded by the top of foundation ( GL) and GL. Any general01 segment is denoted as segment n and lies between GL and GL. Finally, the bottom segment isn-1 n denoted as segment m+1 and lies between GL and the foundation toe.m Calculation Of Segmental Motion Parameters. The SUP analysis defines average acceleration, velocity, and displacement traces that are specific to each segment. In doing so, strain measurements from the top and bottom of each segment and a boundary displacement are required. Boundary displacement may come from the Statnamic laser reference system (top), top of pile acceleration data, or from embedded toe accelerometer data. The displacement is calculated at each gage level using the change in recorded strain with respect to an initial time zero using Equation 7. Because a linearly-varying strain distribution is assumed between gage levels, the average strain is used to calculate the elastic shortening in each segment. Level displacements where n x = the displacement at the nth gage level average seg n ), = the average change in strain in segment n seg n L = the length of the nth segment To perform an unloading point analysis, only the top-of-segment motion needs to be defined. However, the MUP analysis, which is now recommended, requires both top and bottom parameters. The SUP lends itself naturally to providing this information. Therefore, the average segment movement is used rather than the top-of-segment; hence, the SUP actually performs multiple MUP analyses rather than standard UP. The segmental displacement is then determined using the average of the gage level displacements from each end of the segment as shown in the following equation: seg n where x is the average displacement consistent with that of the segment centroid. The velocity and acceleration, as required for MUP, are then determined from the average displacement trace through numerical differentiation using Equations 9 and 10, respectively:(8)(7) (9) (10) \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 246n where v = the velocity of segment n na = the acceleration of segment n )t = the time step from time t to t+1 It should be noted that all measured values of laser displacement, strain, and force are time dependent parameters that are field recorded using high speed data acquisition computers. Hence the time step, )t, used to calculate velocity and acceleration is a uniform value that can be as small as 0.0002 seconds. Therefore, some consideration should be given when selecting the time step to be used for numerical differentiation. The average motion parameters (x, v, and a) for segment m+1 can not be ascertained from measured data, but the displacement at GL can be differentiated directly providing the velocitym and acceleration. Therefore, the toe segment is evaluated using the standard UP. These segments typically are extremely short (1 - 2 m) producing little to no differential movement along its length. Segmental Statnamic and Derived Static Forces. Each segment in the shaft is subjected to a forcing event which causes movement and reaction forces. This segmental force is calculated by subtracting the force at the top of the segment from the force at the bottom. The difference is due to side friction, inertia, and damping for all segments except the bottom segment. This segment has only one forcing function from GL and the side friction is coupled with the tip bearingm component. The force on segment n is defined as: n where S = the applied segment force from strain measurements nE = the composite elastic modulus at level n nA = the cross sectional area at level n n, = the measured strain at level n Once the motion and forces are defined along the length of the pile, an unloading point analysis on each segment is conducted. The segment force defined above is now used in place of the Statnamic force in Equation 2. Equation 12 redefines the fundamental equation of motion for a segment analysis: n Static where, S = the derive static response of segment n nm = the calculated mass of segment n nc = the damping constant of segment n The damping constant (in Equation 13) and the derived static response (Equation 14) of the segment are computed consistent with standard UP analyses:(11) (12) (13) \"In Situ Soil Testing,\" Chapter 2, The Foundation Engineering Handbook , Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.47-86. 247Finally the top-of-foundation derived static response can be calculated by summing the derived static response of the individual segments as displayed in the following equation: Software capable of performing SUP analyses (SUPERSAW) has been developed at the University of South Florida in cooperation with the Federal Highway Administration (Winters, 2002).

They can range from 2 to 30 feet in diameter and can be over 300 feet in length. The term drilled shaft is synonym ous with cast-in-situ piles, bored piles, rotary bored cast-in-situ pil es, or simply shafts. Although once considered a specialty foundation for urban settings where vibrations could not be tolerated or where shallow foundations coul d not develop sufficient capacit y, their use as structural support has rece ntly incre ased due to hei ghtened lateral strength requirements for bridge foundations and the ability of drilled shafts to resist such loads. The y are particularly advantageous where enorm ous lateral loads from extreme event limit states govern bridge foundation design (i.e. vessel impact loads). Further, relat ively new developments in design and construction methods of shafts have provided considerably more econo my to their use in all settings (discussed in an ensuing section on post groutin g dri lled shafts). Additional applications include providing foundations for high mast lighting, cantilevered signs, cellular phone and communication towers. In m any instances, a single drilled shaft can replace a cluster of piles eliminating the need (and cost) for a pile cap. With respect to both axial and lateral design procedures for water crossing bri dges, all foundation types and their respective designs are additionally impacted by scour depth predictions based on 50 or 100 year storm events. Scour is the remov al or erosion of soil from around pil es, shafts, or shall ow footings caused by high velocity stream flows. It is particularly aggravated by constricted flow caused by the presence of numerous bridge piers. The scour-m andated additional f oundation depth dramatically changes driven pile construction where piles can not be driven deep en ough without over stressing the piles or without pre-drilling dense surficial layers. Similarly, the increased unsupported lengt h and slenderness r atio associated with t he lo ss of supporting soil can affect the structural stability of the relatively slender pile elements. In contrast, drilled shaft construction is relatively unaffected by scour dept h requirements and the tremendous lateral stiffness has won the appeal of many designers. Construction Considerations The design methods for drilled shafts prese nted i n this chapter are largely based on empirical correlations developed between soil boring data and measured shaft response to full-scale load tests. In that the database of test cases used to develop these correlati ons i ncluded many di fferent types of construction, these methods can be thought to address construction practices. In reality, most of the design methodologies are extremely conservative for some types of construction and only mil dly conservative for others. The construction of drilled shafts is not a trivial procedure. Maintaining the stabil ity of the excavation prior to and during concrete placement is imperative to assure a str ucturally sound shaft. Various methods of construction have been adopted to address site-specific conditions \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.299-326. 251Drill ed Shafts urry t ype; cased or uncased; trem ie placed or free fall concrete). All of these approaches as well as the fresh properties of the concrete can affect the load carry ing capabi li ty of the f inished shaft. It is important that the design engineer be familiar with dri lled shaft construction methods and can assure that good construction practices are being used. Dry / Wet Construction. Dry cons truction can only be performed in soil formations that are inherently stable when cut (e.g. clay or rock) and where ground water is not present. Any intrusion of ground water into the excavation can degrade the structure of the surrounding soil and hence reduce the capacity of the shaft . In situations where the ground water is present and likely to intrude, some form of wet construction should be used. Wet construction implies that a slurry is placed in the excavation that is capable of maintaining a net positive pressure against (or flow into) the walls of the excavation. The slurry can be mineral, synthetic, or natural. Mineral slurries consist of a bentonite or attapulgite clay premixed with wat er t o produce a stable suspension. As mineral slurries are slightly more dense than water, a 4 - 6 ft head differential above the gro und water should be maintained at all times during introducti on and extraction of the drilling tool. This head differential initially causes a lateral flow into the surrounding so il which is quickly slowed by the formation of a bentonite (or at tapulgite) filter cake. Soil part icle s can be easily suspended in this slurry type for extended periods of time allo wing concrete placement to be conducted without signi ficant amounts of debris accumulation. However, no more than 4% slurry sand content is permitted in most States at the time of concreting. Synthetic slurries consist of a mixture of polymers and water that form a syrupy solution. A 6 - 8 ft head differential should be maintained at all times during the introducti on and extraction of the drilling tool when using a synthetic slurry. This head differential also causes lateral flow into the surrounding soils, but a filter cake is not formed. Rather, the long strings of the polymer stabilize the excavation walls by clinging t o the soil as they fl ow into the soil matrix. As such, the flow remains relatively uniform and generally will not slow. The soil typically falls out of suspension relatively quickly when using synthetic slurries which permits debris to be removed from the bottom in a tim ely fashion. Natural slurri es are nothing more than readily assessable water (g round water, lake water, or salt water). An 8 - 10 ft head differential should be ma intained a t all times during introduction and extraction of the drilling tool when using a natural slurry. This head differential causes a l ateral flow into the surrounding soil which is fast enough to induce outward lateral stress sufficient t o maintain the exca vati on stabi li ty . Although it is possible to use this method in granular soils, it is not recommended nor is it permitted by most State agencies. Slight pressure differentials induced by tool extraction can cause local excavat ion wall instabilities. As such, this method is most commonly used when excavating clay or rock where the ground water is likely to be present. The above slurry types and the time t he slurry is left in an excavation can affect the capacity of the finished shaft (Brown, 2000). To minimize these effects, local specifications have been imposed largely based on past performance in similar soils (FDOT,2002). Casing. Wall stability can also be maintained by using either partial or full length casing. A casing is a relatively thin walled steel pipe that is slightly larger in diameter than the drilling tool. It can be driven, vibrated, jetted, or oscillated (rotated) into position prior to excavation. The purpose of the casing is to provide stability to weak soils where slurri es are ineff ective or to bring t he top o f shaft \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.299-326. 252Drill ed Shafts Mullins 3elevation to a level higher than the surface of free standing bodies of water. When stabilizing weak soils the casing is often temporary being removed after concreting. Shafts constructed over water must use permanent casing that can be removed after the concrete has fully cured. The m ethod of installing and removing temporary casings can also affect the capacity of the fi nished shaf t. Osci llation removal can i ncrease side shear o ver vibrated or direct extraction methods. Quickly extracted casings can induce necking due to low pressure developed at the base of the e xtracted casing. With the exception of full length temporary casing methods, the practical upper li mi t of shaf t length is on the order of 30D (i .e. 90 ft for 3ft diameter shafts) but can be as m uch as 50D in extraordinary circumstances using special excavation methods. Concreting and Mix Design. Drilled shaft concrete is relatively fluid concrete that should be tremie placed (or pumped to the base of the excavation) w hen using any form of wet construction to elim inate the possi bili ty of segregation of fine and coarse aggregate and/or mixing with the in situ slurry. A tr emie is a long pipe t ypically 8 - 12 inches in diameter used to take the concrete to the bottom of the excavation without being altered by the slurry (i.e. mixing or aggregate segregation). Prior to concreting, some f orm of isolation plug should be placed in-line or at the tip of the tremie to prevent contamination of the concrete flow as it passes through the initially empty tremie. During concrete placement, the tremie tip e levation should be maintained below the surface of the rising concrete (typically 5 - 10 f t). However, until a concrete head develops at the base of the excavation, the potential for initial m ixing (and segregation) wil l always exist. In dry con str uction, free-fall concrete placement can be used although it is restricted by some S tate agen cies. The velocity produced by the falling concrete can induce higher lateral pressure on the excavation walls, increase concrete density, and decrease porosity/permeability. However, velocity -induced im pacts on reinforcing steel may mis-align tied steel stirrups and the air cont ent (if specified) of the concrete can be reduced. The concrete mix design for drilled shaft s should produce a sufficient slump (typically between 6 and 9 inches) to ensure that lateral fluid concrete pressure will develop against the excavation wa lls. Further, the concrete should maintain a slump no less than 4 inche s (slump loss limit) for several hours. Thi s typically allows enough time to remove the tremie and any temporary casing while the concrete is still fluid enough to replace the volume of the tremie or casing and minimize suction forces (net negative lateral pressure) during extraction. However, recent studies suggest that a final slump in the range of 3.5 to 4 inches (or less) at the time of tempora ry casing extraction can drastically reduce the side shear capacity of the shaft (Garbin, 2003). As drilled shaft concrete is not vibrated during placement, the maximum aggregate size should be small enough to permi t unrestricted flow through the steel reinforcing cage. The ratio of minimum rebar spacing to maximu m aggregate diameter should be no less than 3 to 5 (FHWA, 1999). \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.299-326. 253Drill ed Shafts Mullins 4Design Capacity of Drilled Shafts The capacity of drilled shaft s is developed from a combination of side shear and end bearing. The side shear is related to the shear strength of the soil and in sands can be thought of as the lesser of the friction (Fr = : N) that de velops b etween the shaft concrete and the surrounding soil or the internal friction within the surrounding soil itself. Although a coeffi cient of friction ( :) can be reasonably approximated, the determination of the normal force (N) is more difficult due to lateral stress relaxation during excavation. In clayey soils or rock side shear is most closely related to the unconfined compressive strength, qu. The end bearing is analogous to shallow foundation bearing capacity with a very large depth of footing. However, it too is affected by construction induced disturbances and like the side shear has been empirically incorporated into the design methods discussed in the ensuing sections. The design approach for dr il led shafts can be either allowable stress design (ASD) or load and resistance factor design (LRFD) as dictated by the client, local municipality, or State agency. In either case, the concept of usable capacity as a function of ultimat e capacity must be addressed. This requires the designer to have some understanding of the capacity versus displacement characteristics of the shaft . Likewise, a permissible displacement limit must be established to determine the usable capacity rather than the ultimate capacity which may be una ttainable within a reasonable displacement. The permissible displacement (or differential d isplacement) is t ypically set by a structural engineer on t he basis of the pro posed str ucture's sensit ivity to such movement. To this end, design of drilled shafts (as well as other foundation types) must superimpose displacement crit eria onto load carrying capability even when using a LRFD approach. This is divergent from other non-geotechnical LRFD approaches that incorporate de sign l imit states independently (discussed later). The designer must be aware of the difference in the required displacem ents to develop significant capacity from side shear and end bearing. For instance, in sand the side shear component can develop 50% of ultimate capacity at a displacement of approximately 0.2% of the shaft diameter (D) (AASHTO, 1997), and develops fully in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 % D (Bruce, 1986). In contrast, the end bearing component requires a displacement of 2.0% D to develop 50% of its capacity (AASHTO, 1997), and ful ly develops i n the range of 10 to 15% D (Bruce, 1986). Therefore, a 4 ft diameter shaft in sand can require up to 0.5 inches displacement to develop ultimate side shear and 7.2 inches to develop ultimate end bearing. Other sources desi gnate the displacement for ultim ate end bearing to be 5% D but recognize the increase in capacity at larger displacements (Reese and Wright, 1977; Reese and O'Neill, 1988). In most instances, the side shear can be assumed to be 100% us able withi n most permissible displacement criteria but the end bearing may not. This give s rise to the c oncept of mobilized capacity. The mobilized end bearing is the capacity that can be developed at a given displacement. Upon determi ning the permissibl e displacement, a proportional capacity can then be established based on a capacity versus displacement relationship as determined by either load testing or past experience. A general relationship will be discussed in the section discussing end bearing determination methods. ASD vs. LRFD. In geotechnical designs, both ASD and LRFD methods must determine an ultim ate capacity from which a usable capaci ty is then extracted based on displ acement criteria. As such the \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.299-326. 254Drill ed Shafts Mullins 5ultim ate capacity is never used, but rather a displacement-restricted usable capaci ty is established as the effective ultima te capacity . For drilled shafts, this capacity typicall y incorporates 100% of ultimate si de shear and the fraction of end bearing mobi lized at that displacement. Once this value has been determined, the following generalized equations represent the equality that must be satisfied when using either an Allowable Stress Design or a Load and Resistance Factor Design approach, respectively. or where, Pu represent s the s um of factored or inflated service loads based on the type of loads, Pn represents the effective ultimate shaft capacity, N is the numb er of sha fts, and N (the resistance factor) reduces the effective ultimate capacity based on the reliability of the capacity determination method. The use of LRFD in geotechnical designs is relatively new and as such present methods have not yet completely separated the various limit states. Typically there are four LRFD limit states: strength, service, fatigue, and extreme event. These limit states treat each area as mutually exclusive issues. Strengt h limit states determine if there is sufficient capacity for a wide range of loading conditi on s. Ser vice limit states address displacement and concrete crack control. Fatigue addresses the usable life span of steel in cyclic or stress reversa l regions. Extreme event limit states introduce less probable but more catastrophic occurrences such as earthquakes or large vessel impacts. Any of the four li mit states can control the final design. The ASD method l umps all load types into a single service lo ad and assumes the same probability for all occurrences. Although LRFD strength limit states should be evaluated without regard to the amount of displacement requi red to d evelop full ultimate capacit y ( Pn), present LRFD methods establish geotechnical ultimate capacity based on some displacement criteria. As a result, LRFD geotechnical service limits states are relatively unused. To this end, this chapter will emphasize the design methods used to determine ultimate capacity and will denote (where appl icabl e) the displacement required to develop that capacity . The fol lowing design methods are either the m ost up to date or th e most widely accepted for the respective soil type and/or soil exploration data. SPT Data in Sand Standard penetrati on test results are most commonly used for estimating a drilled shaft capacity in sandy soils. For some design methods direct capacity correlations to the SPT blow count (N) have been developed; i n other cases correlations to soil properties such as unit weight or internal angle of friction are necessary. Where the unit weight o r the internal friction angle (sands) of a soil is required the relationships shown in Figure 1 can be used. \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M.

The side shear developed between a shaft and surrounding sandy soils can be estimated using the following methods in Table 1. The ul timate load carrying capacity from side shear (Qs) can be expressed as the summation of side shear developed in layers of soil to a given depth containing n layers: where fsi is the estimated unit side shear for the ith soil layer Li is the thickness of (or length of shaft in) the ith soil layer Di is the diameter of the shaft in the ith soil layer Table 1.

Recalling the importance of the mobilized end bearing capacity concept, a parameter termed the tip capacity multiplier (TCM) will be used to quantify the relationship between ul tim ate and usable end bearing capacity. Four design methods using two different approaches to mobilized capacity are discussed. The first and second assume ultimate end bearing occurs at 1.0 inch displacement (Touma and Reese, 1974; Meyerhoff, 1976). The others assume ultimate end bearing occurs at a 5% displace ment as shown in Figure 3 (Reese and Wright, 1977; Reese and O'Neill, 1988). This figure sho ws the lat ter relationship in terms of the permissible displacement expressed as a percentage of the shaft diameter. Therein, the TCM for co nvent ion shafts tipped in sand is linearly proportional to the displacement where the TCM = 1 at 5% displacement. This concept can be extended to the first two design methods as well where TCM = 1 at 1.0 inches displacement. Table 2 lists the four methods used to estimate the ultimate end bearing to which a TCM should be appli ed. Figure 4 shows the calculated ultimate end bearing usi ng each of the four methods in Table 2. The Reese and Wright or Reese and O'Neill methods are r ecommended by the author for end bearing analysis. Using the combined capacity from 100% side shear and TCM*qp using O'Neill and Hassan and Reese and O'Neill methods, respectively, the effective ulti mate capacity of a 3 ft diameter drilled shaft can be estimated as a function of depth, Figure 5. This type of curve is convenient for design as it is a general capacity curve independent of a specific design load. However, when using a LRFD approach, the factored load(Pu) should be divided by the appropriate resistance factor before going to this curve.

The mean undrained shear strength (Su) is derived from a number of t ests conducted on Shelby tube specimens where Su = 1/2 F1 Max . In many instances, both UU and SPT data can be obtained from which local SPT(N) correlations with Su can be established. In the absence of any UU test results, a general correlation from Kulhawy and Mayne (1990) can be used Su = 0.0625 N, in units of tsf Side Shear (alpha method) . The alpha method o f side shear estimation is based on correlations between measured side shear from full-scale load tests and the clay shear strength as determined by UU test results.

Specifically, the top 5 feet of the shaft sides are considered non contributing due to cycli c lateral m ovem ents that separate the shaft from the soil as well as potential dessication separation of the surficial soil. Additionally, the bottom 1D of the shaft side shear is disregarded to account for lateral stresses th at develop radially as the end bearing mobilizes. Although rarely used today, belled ends also affect the side shear near the shaft base. In such cases, the side shear surface area of the bell as well as that area 1D above the bell should not be expected to contr ibute capacity. End Bearing. The end bea ring capacity of shafts tipped in clay is also dependent on the mean undrained shear strength of the clay within two diameters below the tip, Su. As discussed with sh afts tipped in sands, a TCM should be applied to estimated end bearing capacities using the relationship shown in Figure 6. At displacements of 2.5% of the shaft diameter, shafts in clay mobilize 75 to 95% of ultimate capacity. U nli ke sands, however, there is little reserve bearing capacity beyond this displacement. Therefore, a maximum TCM of 0.9 is recommended for conventional shafts at displacements of 2.5%D and proportionally less for smaller permissible displacements. Similar to shallow foun datio n analyses, the following expressions may be used to estimate the ultimate end bearing for shafts with diameters less than 75 inches (AASHTO, 1998): qp = Nc Su # 40 tsf where Nc = 6 [ 1 + 0.2(Z/D)] # 9 for Su > 0.25 tsf Nc = 4 [ 1 + 0.2(Z/D)] # 9 for Su < 0.25 tsf \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M.

Although that study provided design values for bot h mechanical and electric cone data, a single approach is presented below that can conservatively be used for either based on that work. Side Shear. This method for determining side shear resistance in cohesionless soils is divided i nto two soil categories: gravelly sand/gravel or sand/silty sand. In each case below in Table 4, the side shear i s correlated to the cone tip resi stance, qc, instead of the sleeve fricti on due to the absence of that data from some case s tudies at the time o f the study. In cohesive soils, a single expressio n is given which is also dependent on the total vertical stress, Fvo. The same regions of the shaft should be discounted (top 5 ft and bottom 1D) when in cohesive soils as discussed earlier. Table 4.

However, CPT data can also be used to estimate the internal friction and soil density necessary for the Touma and Reese or Beta methods. End Bearing. Expressions for estimating the end bearing using CPT data were also recommended by the same st udy (Alsamman , 1995). Therei n, the end bearing categories were l im ited to cohesionless and cohesive soils. Table 5 provides correlations based on those findings. Table 5.

In these cases, the side shear of s ofter ove rlying materials is disregarded due to the mismatch in the displacement required to mobilize bo th materia l types. Rock sockets r equire relatively small movements to develop full capacity when compared to sand or clay strata. Further, although the end bearing strength of a rock socket can be quite considerabl e, it too is of ten di scounted for the same reason. Alternately, a rock socket may be designed for all end bearing instead of side shear knowing that some side shear capacity will always be available in reserve. Side Shear. The side shear strength of rock-socketed drilled shafts is similar to that of clayey so ils in that it is dependent on the insitu shear strength of the bearing strata. In this case rock cores are taken from the field and tested in various methods. Specifically, mean failure stress from two tests are comm only used: the unconfined compression test, qu; and the splitti ng tensi le test, qs. The test results from these tests can be used to estimate the side shear of a rock socket using the expressions in Table 6. The est imated side shear capacity can be reduced by multiply qs by either the rock quality index, RQD, or the percent sample recovered from the rock core. Local experience and results from load tests can provide the best insight into the most appropriate approach. Table 6. Dril led Shaft Side Shear Desi gn Methods for Rock Sockets Source Side Shear Resistance, fs (tsf) Carter and Kulhawy (1988) fs = 0.15 qu for qu # 20 tsf Horvath and Kenney (1979) fs = 0.67 qu0.5 for qu > 20 tsf McVay and Townsend (1990) fs = 0.5 qu0.5 qs0.5 End Bearing. When determining the end bearing resistance (as well as side shear) of drill ed shaf ts in rock, the quality of rock and type of rock can greatly affect the capacity. In competent rock the structural capacity of the concrete will control the design. In fractured, weathered rock or limestone, the quality of the formation as denoted by the RQD or %recovery should be incorporat ed into the capacity estimate. However, these parameters are influenced by drilling equipment, driller experience and the type of core barrel used to retrieve the samples. The designer should make some attem pt to correla te the rock quality to load test data where possible. The Federal Highway Administrat ion recommends the following expression for estimating the end bearing resistanc e in rock (FHWA, 1988): qb = 2.5 qu %Rec # 40 tsf The value of 40 tsf is undoubtedly conservative with respect to ultimate capacity, but when used in conjunction with a rock socket side s hear it may be reasonable. Under any circumstances, load testing can verify much higher capacities even though they are near impossible to fail in competent rock. \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.299-326. 264Drill ed Shafts Mullins 15Designing from Load Test Data The use of an instrumented load test data for design is thought to be the most reliable approach and is given the highest resistance factor (LRFD) or lowest safety factor (ASD) as a result. This method involves estimating the shaf t capacity using one of the previously discussed method (or similar) and verifying the estimated capacity using a full-scale prototype shaft loaded to ultimate capacity. These tests can be conducted pri or to construction or during construction (denoted as desi gn phase or construction phase load testing, respectively). In either event, the shaft should be loaded well in excess of the design load while monitoring the response (i.e. axial displacement, lateral displacement and/or internal strains). An instrumented load test is one that incorporates strain gages along the length of the foundation to delineate load carrying contributions from various soil strata. The test can merely distinguish side shear from end bearing or addi tional inform ation from discrete shaft segments / soil strata can also be obtained. Any test method capable of applying the ultim ate load can provi de useful feedback to the designer. Tests co nducted t o lesser loads are still useful but provide only a \"proof test\" to the magnitude of the maximum load and can o nly provi de a l ower bound of the actual capacity. As such, the designer should realize that a test shaft that fail s geotechnically , thus prov iding the ultim ate capacit y, is desirable in such a program so that the upper l imit of capacity can be realized. The challenge then is to design a shaft that fails at a load reasonably close to the desired ultimate without being too conservative. However, the loading apparatus should have sufficient reserve to account for a slightly conservative capacity estimate. Side Shear. The ultimate side shear can be determine from load testing by evaluating the response from embedded strai n gages at various elevations in the shaft. It is desirable to delineate bearing strata by placing these gages at the interface between significantly different soil strata (e.g. clay / sand interface). At a minim um, one level of gages should be placed at the tip of the shaf t to separate the load carrying contributions from the side shear and end bearing. By monitoring the str ain at a given level, the corresponding load and difference in load between levels can be determined. It is further desirable to use four gages per level to help indicate eccentricities in the loading as well as provide redundancy. The load at a particular level can be evaluated using strain gage data using the following expression: Pi = gi Ei Ai where Pi is the load at the ith level gi is the strain measured at the ith level Ei is the composite modulus of the ith level, and Ai is the cross sectional area of the ith level. The side shear from a given shaft segment can then be calculated from the difference in measured load from the two level s bounding that segment. fs = (Pi - Pi+1) / (L B D) \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M.

If only using a single gage level at the toe of the shaft, Pi is the applied load to the top of the shaf t and Pi+1 is the load calculated from strain at the toe. End Bearing. The end bearing can be similarly determ ined from strain data. However, the ulti mate end bearing is not necessarily establi shed. Rather, the effective ultimate capacity (usable capacit y) is determined on the basis of permissibl e displacement. Although several approaches do exist that attempt to extract a si ngle capacity value from test data, the entire load versus displacement response should be noted. Figure 7 shows the end bearing response as measured from a load test. A comparison between the measured and predicted values should be prepared so that the original design approach can be calibrated. The end bearing strength is determined from strain gage data using the following expression: qb = Ptoe / A = gtoe Etoe Figure 7 End Bearing Load Test Results. \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M.

Consequently, a large portion of the ultimate capaci ty necessarily goes unused. In an effort to re gain some of this unusable capacity, m echani stic procedures to i ntegrate i ts contributi on have been developed using pressure grouting beneath the shaft tip (also called post grouting or base grouting). Pressure grouting the tips of drill ed shaf ts has been successfully used worldwide to precompress soft debris or loose so il relaxed by Dapp and Mullins, 2002). The post-grouting process entail s: (1) installati on of a grout distribution system during conventional cage preparation that provides grout tube-access to the bottom of the shaft reinforcement cage, and (2) after the shaft concrete has cured, i njection of high pressure grout beneath the tip of the shaft which both densifies the in-situ soil and compresses any debris left by the drilling process. By essentially preloading the soil beneath the tip, higher end bearing capacities can be realized within the service displacement limits. Although post grouting along the sides of the shaft has been reported to be effective, this section will only address the design of post grouted shaft tips. The overall capacity of the shaft is still derived from both side shear and end bearing where the available side shear is calcul ated using one o r a combination of the methods discussed earlier. Further, the calculation of the available side shear is an important step in determi ning the pressure to which the grout can be pumped. Post Grouting in Sand. The design approach for post grouted drilled shaft tips makes use of comm on parameters used for a co nventi onal (un-grouted) drilled shaft design. This methodology includes the following seven steps: (1) Determine the ungrouted end bearing capacity in units of stress. (2) Determine the permissible displacement as a percentage of shaft diameter (e.g.1\"/48\"*100% . 2%). (3) Evaluate the ul timate si de shear resistance for the desired shaft lengt h and diameter (in uni ts of force). (4) Establish a maximum grout pressure that can be resisted by the side shear (ultimate side shear divided by the tip cross sectional area). (5) Calcu late the Grout Pressure Index, GPI, defined as the ratio of grout pressure to th e ungrouted end bearing capacity ( Step 3 / Step 1 ). (6) Using design curves from Figure 8, determine the Tip Capacity Multiplier, TCM, using the GPI calculated in Step 5 . (7) Calculate the grouted end bearing capacity (effective ultimate) by multiplying the TCM by the ungrouted end bearing (TCM * Step 1 ). \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.299-326. 267Drill ed Shafts Mullins 18 The ungrouted capacity (GPI = 0) is represented by these curves at the y-intercept where TCM = 1 for a 5% displacement (no improvement). The 1% a nd 2% intercepts reduce the end bearing according to the normal behavior of partially mobilized end bearing. Interestingly, the grouted end bearing capacity is strongly dependent on available side shear capacity (grout pressure) as well as the permissible displacement. However, it is relatively independent of the ungrouted end bearing capacity when in sandy soils. As such, the end bearing in loose sand deposits can be greatl y i mproved in both stiffness and ultimate capacity given sufficient side shear against which to develop grout pressure. In dense sands and clays significant improvement in stiffness can be real ized wi th more modest effects on ultim ate capacity . Figure 9 shows the effective ulti mate capaci ty that c an be expe cted from a grouted shaft similar to that from Example 1. Figure 8 Correlations used in Step 6 to establish TCM (Mullins, et al., 2001). \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M. (ed), CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton, FL ISBN 0-8493-1169-4, pp.299-326. 268Drill ed Shafts Mullins 19Post Grouting in Other Formations. Post grouting shaf t tips in other formations such as clays, silts, and r ock can be advantageous for the sam e reasons as in sand. However, the degree of improvement may be more modest. I n clays and pl astic silts, the TCM can be assumed to be 1.0 although studies have shown it to be as high as 1.5 if sufficient side shear can be developed (Mullins and O'Neill, 2003). In non plastic silts, the TCM can be assumed to be 1.0 for initial designs but a veri fication load test program is recommend as much higher values may be reasonable. In rock, post grouted shafts have the potential to engage both the side shear and end bearing sim ultaneously . In all soil types the achieved grout pressure can be used as a lower bound for usable end bearing and the attainable grout pressure is always dependent on the available side shear against which to react. In contrast, sufficient side shear capacity does not assure that grout pressure can be developed without excessive volumes of grout. Post grouting shaft tips provides a capacity verification for every shaft grouted. To optimize its use and design, a full load test pro gram should be scheduled at the onset to confirm the TCM most appropriate for a given site and soil type.

As such, a designer may employ a range of safety factors (or resistance factors) given the level of confidence tha t can be assi gned to a particular scenari o. The most comm on method of establishing a particular level of certainty is via some form of testing. This testing can ra nge from applying the full anticipated load (static or statnami c tests) to a minimum of a subsurface i nvestigation to esti mate insi tu soil properties. Load tests result in the highest increase in designer confidence and can be incorporat ed int o the design in the form of adjusted/calibrated unit strengths, reduced safety factors, or increased re sistan ce factors. The effects of design uncertainty can be illustrated by the AASHTO (1998) specifications for driven piles where the designer must select from nine different resistance factors ranging from 0.35 to 0.80 based on the design methodology. Four of the se conditions are selected based on the level/quality of testing that is anticipated. Therein, the highest resistance factor (0.8) and co nfidence is asso ciated with a load test. The next highest ( 0.65) is assigned to test methods related to installation monitoring. In contrast, the lowest confidence and resistance factor (0.35 - 0.45) is assigned when a design is based solely on capacity correl ations with SPT data. Although som e resista nce factors for drilled shafts are not given by AASHTO, the resistance factors most commonly range from 0.5 to 0.8 for no testing to load t est ing, respectively. The fol lowing two exam ples wil l use estimated costs to illustrate the impact of shaft size (diameter) and design approach ( N factor) on cost effectiveness. The cost of shaft construction and testing can vary significantly based on the number of shafts and type of material excavated as well as the physical conditions and location of the site. Even though a typical unit price of a drilled shaft includes each of these parameters, this approach can be used for comparisons using updated site-specific values. Given: 3 ft diameter shaft $100 / lineal foot excavation and concreting 4 ft diameter shaft $200 / lineal foot excavation and concreting 6 ft diameter shaft $400 / lineal foot excavation and concreting Static load test $125 / ton of test 1% of shafts tested (1 min.) Statnamic load test $35 / ton of test 1% of shafts tested (1 min.) Use: Boring log and effective ultimate capacity calculations from Example 1, as well as the following resistance values (slightly update from most recent AASHTO) Static load test N = 0.75 Statnamic load test N = 0.73 No testing (SPT only) N = 0.55 Assume a maximum excavation depth of 30D Selecting the Most Economical Shaft Diameter. Many options are available to the designer when selecting the diamete r of shaft to be used for a specific foundation. For instance, a lo ng, small diameter shaft can pr ovide equivalent axial capacity to a shorter, larger diameter shaft. Figure 10 \"Design of Drilled Shafts,\" Chapter 7, The Foundation Engineering Handbook Gunaratne, M.

These curves are based on axi al capacity and the cost may further vary given significant lateral loading and the associated bending m oment requirements. In th is case, the 3 ft diameter shaft is the most cost effective at all depths. Selecting the Most Economical Design Method. The next comparison that can be ma de is that which evaluates the cost ef fectiveness of various desi gn/testi ng m ethods. As additional testing (beyond soil exploration) incurs extra expense, a break even analysis should be perf ormed to justify its use. In this case, a 3 ft diameter shaft will be used due to the results shown in Figure 10 where it was consistently less cost ly. The maximum c apaci ty that can be reasonable provided by a 3 ft diameter shaft will be calculated to be 602 tons at a depth of 90 ft (30D)*. The effectiv e ultimat e capacity is then reduced based on the presumption of testing (or no t esting) and the appropriate resistance factor. Usi ng these values a 3500 ton factored pier l oad (Pu) would require more or fewer shafts given various resistance factors as shown in Table 7. * NOTE: As deeper excavations are possible, the ultimate structural capacity based on con crete strength should not be exceeded.

Above 3500 tons, the cost savings produced b y statnami c or static load testing becom e si gni ficant w ith statnamic costs being slightly less in all cases. The selection of load test method and the associated cost is often based on the availability of test equipment capable of producing the ultimate geotechnical capacit y. Further, the dispa rity between testing and no testing can be even more drastic when design phase testing can be implemented. Therein, the estimated ultimate capacity base d on empi rical design methods is oft en cons ervative and can be raised using the results of a test program which further widens the range of shaft numbers (testing versus no testing) required for a given pier. In general, load test r esults t ypically show that predictions of ultimate capacity are conservative. This form of verification can be helpful in all instances: when under-predictions are severe, the design capacity of the foundations can be adjusted to provide cost sav ings; when over-predictions are encountered, more moderate design values can be incorporated to circumvent possible failures.

Previous international usage relied predominantly upon experience and unpublished proprietary approaches. More recently, research aimed at quantifying theimprovement that could be derived from postgrouting drilled shaft tips has resulted in a design methodology. This paper briefly discussesthe postgrouting process and outlines the full scale test programs used to identify parameters affecting postgrouting performance.Correlations developed between applied grout pressure and end bearing improvement are presented along with a numerical exampleillustrating the design procedure. DOI: 10.1061//H20849ASCE/H208501090-0241/H208492006/H20850132:4/H20849478/H20850 Design criteria; Predictions . Introduction The unit ultimate end bearing of drilled shafts tipped in cohesion- less soil can be on the order of 20 times the unit ultimate sideshear. However, this enormous capacity is rendered virtually un-usable due to multiple mechanisms associated with constructiontechniques and soil mechanics. The two primary construction-related mechanisms that hamper end bearing development in-clude: /H208491/H20850soil relaxation beneath the shaft tip due to excavation and /H208492/H20850debris remaining after cleanout. Furthermore, even under ideal shaft construction conditions, ultimate side shear is devel-oped in only a fraction of the displacement required to developthe ultimate end bearing. The side shear fully develops at a dis- placement between 0.5 and 1.0% of the shaft diameter /H20849D/H20850; whereas, the end bearing is fully mobilized at displacements of10-15% D/H20849Bruce 1986; Mullins et al. 2000/H20850. Therefore, the end bearing requires 10-30 times more displacement than side shearin order to mobilize the same percentage of its ultimate value. Asa result, engineers typically must discount or signicantly reducethe end bearing contribution to the capacity of drilled shafts toaccommodate service/displacement limits. In 1999, a 4 year study was initiated to quantify the effects of pressure grouting beneath the base of drilled shafts and show itspotential to mitigate the above mechanisms plaguing end bearingcapacity. This method was expected to be applicable to projectswith deep cohesionless deposits where the soil strata would re-quire excessively long drilled shaft lengths without considerableend bearing contribution and in urban areas where vibrations as-sociated with pile driving are not well tolerated. This paper brieflydiscusses the results from this study and introduces a new designprocedure for predicting end bearing capacity in postgrouteddrilled shafts tipped in cohesionless soils. Background In the early 1960s, efforts to improve the end bearing of drilledshafts began outside the United States using high pressure groutinjected beneath the shaft tip /H20849Bolognesi numerous case studies have been documented statingits effectiveness. This end bearing modication technique, alsocalled postgrouting or base grouting, has been used worldwide,yet literature on its use lacks a rational design approach. As aconsequence, there has been little use in the United States. As thispaper focuses on the design of the end bearing capacity, a thor-ough overview of postgrouting processes can be found elsewhere/H20849Bruce 1986; Mullins et al. 2000/H20850. In general, the postgrouting technique involves casting drilled shafts with a grout delivery system incorporated into the reinforc-ing cage capable of placing high pressure grout at the base of theshaft /H20849after the shaft concrete has cured/H20850. This both densies the in situ soils and compresses any debris left by the drilling process.Moreover, by preloading the soil beneath the tip, end bearingcapacity can be developed within service/displacement limits. Inprevious studies, it was suggested that pressure-grouted shaftstipped in loose to medium dense sand provided the most benet,but improvement was observed in all soil types cited. Specically,end bearing could be improved in sands and clays with ultimatecapacities as much as two to three times conventional ungroutedshafts /H20849Bruce 1986/H20850. The same sources purported end bearing improvement to be dependent on the volume of grout injected. 1Associate Professor, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, 4202 E.

Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://pubs.asce.org/copyright 277However, the improvement was shown to be more directly related to grout pressure by the authors and forms the basis of the newdesign method. During base grouting, the grout pressure produces a bidirec- tional force at the shaft tip, wherein the development of the endbearing is resisted by the skin friction of the shaft. Hence, longershafts or shafts that develop more side shear can resist highergrout pressure. Previous studies that cited both the applied groutpressure and shaft length /H20849or depth/H20850 show an increasing trend of grout pressure with depth /H20849Fig. 1/H20850. This is in keeping with the understanding that the maximum grout pressure is dependent onthe available side shear on which the grout pressure can react. In concept, the anticipated grout pressure for a given site can be generalized with respect to the shaft length, diameter, and theaverage unit side shear /H20849Fig. 2/H20850. As the grout pressure is a func- tion of tip area, unit side shear, and shaft length, the expressionfor anticipated grout pressure can be simplied as shear; and L/D=shaft length to diameter ratio. From a more practical perspective, several ranges are also identied in Fig. 2 that denote applicable limits on grout pressure.The lines denoting unit side shear values present upper bounds ongrout pressure for shafts constructed in soils with average unitside shear values of 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 MPa /H208490.5, 1.0, and 2.0 tsf/H20850. For all soils and L/Dratios, an upper limit on grout pressure is typically applied that considers the construction limitations of thegrout pump, grout tubes, or the working life of the neat cementgrout. Although pressures as high as 11 MPa /H208491,600 psi/H20850 are attainable, a 6.9 MPa /H208491,000 psi/H20850 upper limit is more realistic without having to use specialized equipment. An example lower limit is also presented that represents the hydrostatic pressure of wet concrete for a 1 m diameter shaft.Assigning a grout pressure at or below this level does not providea benet worthy of the effort. Although in some instances theprocess of merely flushing grout through the tubes and groutingcell has shown grout volume taken into soft areas or unexpectedvoids, far more can be derived from a pressure grouting protocolthat takes full benet from an optimized design. End Bearing Development Reese and O'Neill /H208491988/H20850 showed that the end bearing capacity of conventional ungrouted shafts could be expressed as a function ofshaft diameter and the permissible settlement /H20849Fig. 3/H20850. Therein, the ultimate design capacity based on 5% displacement was givenby q b= 0.057N /H208494/H20850 where qb=ultimate unit end bearing capacity /H20849MPa/H20850; and N=uncorrected standard penetration test /H20849SPT/H20850 blow count. At displacements less than 5% D, a reduced capacity should be assigned using a tip capacity multiplier /H20849TCM/H110211/H20850based on the above relationship and the permissible displacement; at larger Fig. 1.

Eq. /H208495/H20850provides a convenient curve t for the TCM shown in Fig. 3 TCM =%D 0.4/H20849%D/H20850+ 3.0/H208495/H20850 TCM values greater than 1.0 corroborate Bruce's /H208491986/H20850 state- ment that shafts tipped in sand could continue to develop capacity up to 15% D. Unfortunately, large displacements such as these are rarely permissible due to service limits. For example, a 1.2 m/H208494f t/H20850diameter shaft would have to displace 61 mm /H208492.4 in./H20850 in order to achieve ultimate capacity; whereas shear woulddevelop in 6-12 mm /H208490.24-0.48 in./H20850 , shown in Fig. 4. At full side shear development, only about a third of the design endbearing has been developed. As an alternate, postgrouting beneaththe shaft tip provides a method to avail higher usable end bearingat more reasonable displacements. Effects of Side Shear Capacity on Grout Pressure The grout pressure required to affect end bearing improvement incohesionless soil is dependent on the available side shear. Assuch, uplift of the shaft is possible as the force from the appliedgrout pressure over the area of the toe approaches the ultimateside shear capacity. At this point, the grout pressure has bothdisplaced/compressed the soil beneath the toe and strained theside shear in uplift. Depending on whether the grout pressure ismaintained or released during the curing of the grout, two stressstates may exist. Figs. 5 and 6 conceptually show the load historyof the side shear and soil beneath the toe during the grouting andstructural loading phases for maintained and released grout pres-sure, respectively. Four points are highlighted on each graphshowing pertinent phases: Point /H208491/H20850, the initial unstressed state; Point /H208492/H20850, the maximum applied grout pressure; Point /H208493/H20850, the grout cured, prior to structural loading; and Point /H208494/H20850, after structural loading assuming a 1% Dsettlement. Although the mechanism by which the load is transferred into the soil issignicantly different for the two approaches, the net effect isvirtually identical with regards to load carrying capabilities. When the grout pressure is maintained or locked-in during curing /H20849Fig. 5/H20850, the toe load required to hold the shaft in negativeside shear increases slightly as applied structural loads overcomethe negative side shear /H20849small displacements/H20850. In effect, the side shear load required to hold the soil beneath the toe in compressionis replaced by the structural loading until the negative side shearis completely overcome, after which, additional load can be de-veloped by positive side shear and a further increase in end bear-ing. The load carrying mechanism from precompressing the toesoils is analogous to pretensioning bolts used for tensile loading.Therein, bolts are commonly pretensioned during installation toover 90% of the usable capacity. This causes a clamping forcethat equals the sum of the bolt group pretensioning. The tensileloads in the bolts remain the same throughout the life of theconnection but are ultimately resisted by a combination of struc-tural loads and clamping forces. If the structural loads exceed theinitial clamping force, plate separation occurs and the remaining10% of the bolt capacity can be mobilized as needed up to theultimate load. Fig. 7 shows the similarities between postgroutedshaft tips and a bolted tension connection /H20849the bolt analogy is explained in italics/H20850. When the grout pressure is released before curing or unlocked /H20849Fig. 6/H20850, the soil beneath the toe is loaded normally during grout-ing, allowing large precompressing displacements to occurfollowed by a relatively stiff unloading. The side shear is stressed Fig. 4. Typical displacement mismatch between end bearing and side shear Fig. 5. Conceptual load/displacement history for locked-in grout pressure Fig. 6.

Upon application of structural loading, the side shear develops normally /H20849acting up- ward/H20850 while the end bearing is reloaded along a much stiffer path where the displacement required to fully develop the end bearingis commensurate with that of the side shear. Minimal differences have been observed in the resultant capacity from these two mechanisms /H20849Frederick 2001; Mullins and Winters 2004/H20850. In reality, some relaxation occurs in the soilbeneath the toe even when the pressure is locked in. Conse-quently, the actual response in these cases reflects a combinationof both scenarios. The design method presented herein stems from a database of 26 grouted and ungrouted test shafts tipped in sand, silt, and clayat eight different sites which incorporated both locked-in and un-locked approaches. Five of these sites had shafts tipped in sand,silty sand, shelly sand, or slightly cemented sand. This paperfocuses on the improvement in cohesionless soils. Therefore, adiscussion of the sites in cohesive soils is not presented withinthis paper. Full-Scale Field Study The research program consisted of both model-scale and full-scale testing. Model-scale testing was carried out within a frustumconning vessel and explored parameters affecting postgroutingperformance and cavity expansion where the shafts could be eas-ily exhumed /H20849Frederick 2001; Mullins et al. 2001; Dapp 2002; Mullins and Winters 2004/H20850. The objective of the eld studies werethreefold: /H208491/H20850to quantify the improvement that could be devel- oped by pressure grouting the tip of the shaft; /H208492/H20850to develop design recommendations for the use of pressure grouting drilledshaft tips; and /H208493/H20850to establish criteria/guidelines for effective grouting. Although, the majority of sites included a control shaft/H20849conventional, with no postgrouting/H20850, the response of the groutedshafts was also compared to end bearing design capacity predic-tions from soil boring logs /H20849i.e., AASHTO 1999/H20850. Two different grout distribution systems were used throughout the study: the flat jack and the sleeve port /H20849also known as tube- a-manchette/H20850. Each system has associated advantages, but bothprovided similar end bearing improvement. A full discussion ofthese systems can be found elsewhere /H20849Mullins et al. 2001; and Dapp 2002/H20850. The ensuing sections outline the site conditions andload test results for each of the sites where shafts were tipped insandy soils. Sites I and II: Clearwater, Fla. A total of eight shafts were constructed and tested within two adjacent sites located in Clearwater, Fla. These shafts each had adiameter of 0.61 m /H208492.0 ft/H20850 and were 4.57 m /H2084915 ft/H20850 in length. Five shafts, including one control shaft, were tested in Site I/H20849loose to medium dense shelly sand/H20850; while three shafts, includingone control shaft, were tested in Site II /H20849loose silty /H2084910 cm2/H20850 cone penetration soundings as well as standard penetration test-ing. The minicone was used to quickly delineate site variability,the 10 cm 2cone was used at each shaft location, and the SPT borings were conducted between the shaft locations. Excavationwas conducted using polymer slurry for stabilization. Full details Fig. 7. Comparison of bolt pretensioning to shaft tip precompression Fig. 8.

Three test shafts, grouted and ungrouted, were constructed and tested in slightly cemented coquina sand located at the Royal ParkBridge crossing the Intracoastal waterway in Palm Beach, Fla.One of these shafts, LT-3, was a 1.22 m /H208494.0 ft/H20850 diameter, 34.80 m /H20849114.2 ft/H20850 long grouted shaft. A combination of temporary and permanent casing was used with a sea water drill slurry. Fig. 12shows the SPT soil boring and the end bearing results for LT-3. Additional information for Site III can be found in Dapp andMullins /H208492002/H20850. Site IV: West Palm Beach, Fla. Two test shafts, grouted and ungrouted, were constructed and load tested as part of the PGA Blvd Grade Separation Bridge Project inWest Palm Beach, Fla.

A total of four 1.22 m /H208494.0 ft/H20850 diameter drilled shafts were constructed. A target load of 17.8 MN /H208492,000 t /H20850was used in determining the shaft lengths. Two shafts were tipped insandy soil while the other two shafts were tipped in clayey soil.Each pair of test shafts included a control shaft and a groutedshaft. The subsurface investigation of the test site was performedusing three primary methods of exploration: standard penetrationtests /H20849SPT/H20850; Texas cone penetration tests /H20849TCP/H20850; and cone pen- etration tests /H20849CPT/H20850. All shafts were constructed using mineral slurry. Fig. 14 shows the SPT soil boring and load test results for test shaft S-2 /H20849tipped in sand and grouted/H20850.

End Bearing Results Many design methodologies exist for the calculation of drilled shaft tip capacities in sandy soils. For example, AASHTO /H208491999/H20850 presents four methods from which this determination can be Fig. 13.

These methods vary in the required parameters but use either SPT Nvalues, the relative density state, and/or the depth of embedment expressed as a multiple of the diameter to calculatethe end bearing capacity. An important aspect of this capacitydetermination is the displacement at which the capacity will bedeveloped. Some methods clearly state this criterion as a percent-age of the shaft diameter or as some service limit displacement/H20849e.g., 5% of D,o r1i n . /H20850, while other methods do not. This research project used the Reese and O'Neill /H208491988/H20850 method /H20851Eq. /H208494/H20850/H20852to predict the ultimate end bearing capacity from SPT values as well as load test data. Table 1 provides details fromeach of the full-scale grouted test shafts expressed as a multiple ofthe Reese and O'Neill predicted capacity. The end bearingimprovement is given in terms of the tip capacity multiplier/H20849TCM/H20850, for the measured end bearing at 1, 2, and 5% Ddisplace- ments. As the end bearing improvement is dependent on theapplied grout pressure, the grout pressure is also listed both di-mensionally /H20849in kPa/H20850 and nondimensionally /H20851as the grout The GPI is dened as a nondimensional ratio of the applied grout pressure to the ungrouted end bearing at a displace-ment of 5% D/H20851Eq. /H208494/H20850/H20852. The applied grout pressure was taken as the maximum sustained grout pressure and not a short duration pressure spike.Design of Postgrouted Tip Capacity To quantify the improvement with respect to standard design practice, a predictive approach was established on the basis of theTCM and the GPI. The TCM was dened as a function of dis-placement and grout pressure. By plotting the results from Table 1/H20849Fig. 15/H20850, a surface can be dened that incorporates both theeffects of grout pressure and permissible displacement /H20849Fig. 16/H20850. Dashed lines in Fig. 16 show lines of constant TCM while solidlines show lines of constant displacement and grout pressure. The plane dened by the displacement and TCM axes inter- sects the surface forming a hyperbolic relationship identical to thecenterline trend that Reese and O'Neill published in 1988 shownin Figs. 3 and 15. Therein, when the GPI=0 no improvement isexpected and it therefore predicts the same capacity as anungrouted shaft. Likewise, when the permissible displacementapproaches zero, so does the predicted mobilized capacity. Amore usable form of this surface is given in Fig. 17 which showsthe TCM contours. Given the GPI and displacement, the TCMcan be estimated using Fig. 17 or with the following empiricalrelationship: TCM = 0.713/H20849 GPI/H20850/H20849% D 0.364/H20850+%D dened by Fig. 16 is nonlinear with respect to % D but linear with respect to variations in GPI. As the GPI and theTCM are both ratios based on the ungrouted end bearing, both theTCM and GPI increase or decrease similarly dependent on theungrouted end bearing selected. Therefore, the TCM is onlymildly affected by the method of determining the ungrouted endbearing. At high GPI values and low % Dvalues, the TCM is insensitive to the ungrouted prediction method. As GPI ap-proaches zero, the grouted end bearing approaches the ungroutedcapacity and therefore is subject to the conservatism or unconser-vatism associated with whatever method was used to estimate theungrouted capacity. Design Procedure For a given shaft diameter and embedment length, the method forestimating the unit end bearing of grouted shafts involves thefollowing steps: Fig. 15.

This is with a per- missible shaft displacement of 25 mm /H208491 in./H20850 and an ungrouted end bearing capacity of 1.71 MPa /H2084918 tsf/H20850 using Eq. /H208494/H20850/H20849N=30/H20850. Summary and Conclusions A rational method of predicting the end bearing capacity of post- grouted shafts tipped in cohesionless soils has been developedbased on the performance of full scale grouted shaft load tests.The new approach incorporates input parameters such as the ser-vice displacement criteria, the attainable grout pressure, and theestimated conventional ungrouted shaft end bearing. Unlike con-ventional shaft construction and the associated quality assurancemethodologies, each and every shaft is tested via the groutingprocess. Inherently, the grouting then provides quantitative dataon the skin friction and end bearing capacity of each shaft. There-fore, grouting veries a lower limit of total shaft capacity thatequals two times the grout pressure acting over the entire tip area.The actual capacity, which is predicted using Eq. /H208499/H20850, is somewhat higher due to an increase in the mobilized end bearing duringdownward structural loading and the /H1101130% increase in side shear from downward instead of upward movement /H20849O'Neill 2002/H20850. As the attainable GPI relies on the side shear capacity on which the grout pressure can react, the aspect ratio /H20849embedment length/diameter/H20850 of the drilled shafts should be carefully consid- ered in order to provide the most cost efcient design. Note thatpotentially stringent lateral loading conditions may govern thefoundation design, and may further dene the shaft geometry thatbest supplies the capacities required /H20849both axial and lateral/H20850. The methodology presented herein only addresses axial capacity. The use of grouted shafts has long reaching implications with regards to the state of drilled shaft construction and design. Thisstems from the unparalleled quality assurance that accompaniesthe process. Shaft lengths can be reduced and an associated costsavings realized. Further, by statically grout testing each shaft, anincreased resistance factor /H20849or lower safety factor/H20850 may likely result for shafts constructed in this fashion. Such an increase inthe resistance factor can lead to additional economy.

Chlorides from seawater penetrate the concrete cover and destroy the passive layer that normally protects steel from corrosion. The high temperatures and high humidity in this region accelerate the corrosion process, leading, in some cases, to signs of visible damage within as little as 18 months. Jacketing, in which concrete is cast around the damaged pile, is the most common method of pile repair (Fig. 1). Typically, stay-in-place fiberglass forms are used, and the annular concrete inside the form is reinforced if damage is severe. Unfortunately, such repairs have proven ineffective, as the corrosion process is not stopped, and the opaque jacket and form prevent inspectors from detecting corrosion activity during routine biennial inspections. As a result, corrosion is detected only when it reaches an advanced stage. Since the mid-1990s, a new type of pile jacket, incorporating a cathodic protection system, 1 has been introduced. In this system, a sacrificial zinc anode corrodes preferentially, thereby protecting the steel. The cost of corrosion damage can be high, especially when frequent re-repairs are needed. This has led highway authorities to explore alternate repairs using fiber-reinforced polymers (FRPs). In 1994, the Vermont Agency for Transportation 2 opted to repair corrosion- damaged columns using FRP, and several other highway agencies have since experimented with this technique in demonstration projects. These repairs show little distress after several years of service. 3 However, this practice remains controversial and is not recommended by ACI Committee 440. 4 A Demonstration of Underwater FRP Repair A water-activated resin matrix is used to repair piles BY GRAY MULLINS, RAJAN SEN, KWANG SUK SUH, AND DANNY WINTERS In this article, we describe a field demonstration study in which corroding reinforced concrete piles in tidal waters were wrapped using a unique FRP system. This is part of an ongoing research program conducted by the University of South Florida to evaluate the feasibility of using FRP for repairing corrosion-damaged piles. 5 DESCRIPTION The Gandy Boulevard bridges comprise three side- by-side structures over Tampa Bay, between St. Petersburg and Tampa, FL. The bridges are approximately 2.6 miles (4.2 km) long, with the oldest dating from 1956. Although this bridge was slated for demolition in 1997, the community rallied to have it refurbished. In 1999, it was reopened as the \"Friendship TrailBridge,\" the longest over-water recreational (pedestrian) trail in the world. The bridge has 275 spans supported by 254 reinforced concrete pile bents and 22 column-type piers located at the main channel crossing. The salinity of Tampa Bay fluctuates with the seasons, but normally exceeds 30 parts per thousand, thus creating a highly corrosive environment. In fact, our inspection showed that 77% of the 254 pile bents had been jacketed or otherwise repaired. The main goal of our study was to evaluate the feasibility of making underwater pile repairs without using cofferdams. For simplicity and to avoid remnants and effects of previous repair efforts, only pile bents with no repair history were considered for this demonstration. Further preference was given to adjacent bents in similar condition. This reduced the potential for spatial variation of geotechnical effects (differences in stresses imposed during pile driving) and also minimized mobilization efforts. 287Concrete international / JANUARY 2006 71DEMONSTRATION The bents and piers are numbered 1 through 276, starting on the St. Petersburg side. Piles in Bent 99 were selected as control piles, and those in Bents 100 and 101 were wrapped (Fig. 2). These bents were close to the piers of the new Gandy Bridge, which provided a convenient staging area. The four piles in Bent 100 were wrapped using glass or carbon fibers in a unique, water-activated resin matrix. Two piles in Bent 101 were wrapped using a different epoxy system also developed for underwater use. In this article, we discuss the installation of the wraps in Bent 100 only. The 20 x 20-in. (510 x 510-mm) piles were originally reinforced with eight No. 8 (25 mm) Grade 60 bars. Using an assumed uniform 20% steel loss, we determined the amount of carbon or glass required to restore full capacity. For carbon fibers, this translated into one unidirectional (longitudinal) layer, rated at 3400 lb/in. (600 kN/m) capacity, followed by two bidirectional wrapped layers, rated at 2400 lb/in. (420 kN/m) per layer in each direction. Equivalent strengthening using glass fibers required almost double this amount. That is, we used two unidirectional, longitudinal layers, each rated at 2400 lb/in. (420 kN/m), and four bidirectional wrapped layers, rated at 1200 lb/in. (210 kN/m) per layer in each direction. Pre-wrap measurements The chloride content was estimated by taking four concrete cores at two different elevations: the high water line and 18 in. (460 mm) above. The total chloride content was measured every 1 in. (25 mm) down to the level of the steel. The chloride content at the level of the steel Fig. 1: Piles of the Friendship TrailBridge that have been previously repaired using concrete jackets Fig. 2: The four piles of Bent 100 selected for FRP repair Fig. 3: Corrosion assessment using surface potential measurements per ASTM C 876 7 prior to repair Fig. 4: Installation of scaffold around the four piles in Bent 100.

Likewise, measurements of surface potential taken using a copper- copper sulfate reference electrode registered values more negative than -350 mV, indicating there was a 90% probability of active corrosion7 in regions more than 2 ft (610 mm) below the pile cap (Fig. 3). Scaffold construction In an earlier demonstration study on the Allen Creek Bridge,8 piles could be wrapped by standing on ladders in the shallow water. In Tampa Bay, however, the water is much deeper (about 16 ft [4.9 m]) and the tidal currents are relatively strong. Ladders were therefore not practical, so we devised a simple, inexpensive, and lightweight scaffolding system that was both easy to assemble and sufficiently rigid to support personnel during wrapping. The scaffold comprised expanded steel grating and steel angles and was configured in four sections with appropriate cutouts for the piles. When assembled, the platform was 33 ft (10 m) long by 7 ft (2.1 m) wide and was suspended 9 ft (2.7 m) from the top of the pile cap. This meant the work platform was 2 ft (0.6 m) below the nominal low tide elevation and 0.5 ft (150 mm) below the lowest point of the wrap, allowing workers to wrap the piles over a 5.5-ft-long (1.7 m) zone, starting from the underside of the cap. Figure 4 shows the scaffolding being installed around the piles. Surface preparation To prepare the surfaces for wrapping, we removed marine growth and loose concrete and then filled undulations with a quick-setting hydraulic-cement mortar to provide a smooth surface. We used an air grinder to round each of the chamfers at the pile corners to a 3/4-in. (19-mm) radius. Just before wrapping, the surfaces were pressure- washed using fresh water to remove dust, debris, and marine growth (Fig.5). Underwater wrapping Because the repairs were made using a water-activated resin, the fiber mats were cut to manageable lengths, impregnated with the resin, and packed in hermetically sealed pouches to prevent ambient water vapor from initiating curing of the resin. Sealed pouches containing the various resin-impregnated pieces of mat were brought to the site and opened just before wrapping. On-site adjustments to material lengths were made as necessary. Similar procedures were used for applying the carbon fiber and glass fiber wraps. A primer was first applied over the surface of the pile. For the carbon fiber system, this was followed by the positioning of a longitudinally- oriented, unidirectional layer (Fig. 6). Next, two bidirec - tional wrap layers (Fig. 7) were spirally wrapped with no overlap from top to bottom for Layer 1, and from bottom to top for Layer 2. The same sequence was used for the glass fiber system, but it was carried out twice for both the unidirectional and wrap layers. Following placement of the structural FRP, a single spirally-wrapped layer of a finely-woven glass veil was applied starting from the bottom with a 2-in. (50-mm) overlap to consolidate the structural fibers (Fig. 8). This was followed by application of plastic shrink- wrap to secure the wrap in place while curing (Fig. 9). In regions above the water line, water was sprayed on the wrap as it was being placed. Also, because the reaction process during resin curing yields gaseous products, the shrink-wrap was punctured over its entire length to allow these gases to escape. Following a day of curing, the shrink- wrap was removed and the FRP wrap was painted with a UV-resistant coating (Fig. 10). It took a total of 3 hours to complete wrapping of the four piles. Figure 11 shows the pile bent after all four piles had been wrapped.

Deese, M.S.C.E., E.I. and Gray Mullins, Ph.D., P.E.1 2 ABSTRACT In recent years, it has become apparent that concreting during drilled shaft construction does not necessarily scour the excavation walls as previously thought. In fact, the flow pattern of fluid concrete is highly non-uniform with the preferential path flowing up along the side of the tremie pipe. The primary variable affecting flow was speculated to be concrete slump although other variables such as cage spacing have been hypothesized. This paper discusses several studies conducted by the University of South Florida in conjunction with the Florida Department of Transportation and Auburn University to evaluate construction practices that lead to anomalies. As a result, several parameters that affect concrete flow were identified and are presented herein along with case studies where field measurements documented these effects. INTRODUCTION Implementation of drilled shaft foundations has increased significantly since their inception. Their immense lateral stiffness and applicability to geological formations not conducive to pile driving has secured their place as a common, cost-effective type of deep foundation. However, it has become clear that sensitivity to the construction process is paramount for this type of foundation. The construction process consists of three distinct steps: (1) excavate the borehole, (2) position the reinforcement cage in the shaft, and (3) place concrete into the borehole. There are numerous methods (and numerous problems) for completing each of the three steps, however, the geological environment can govern which is the appropriate course of action to create a reliable structural element. Due to the host of logistical problem facing the drilled shaft contractor, strict regulations and standards have been imposed on shaft construction by several state DOTs and FHWA. Even so, documented cases of anomalies and/or poorly performing shafts continue to arise. This prompted a deeper look into the mechanics of the construction Proceedings of the ADSC - GEO3 Construction Quality Assurance / Quality Control Conference Bruce, D. and Cadden, A. (eds), Dallas, Texas November, 2005, pp. 144-153. 2912 Deese and Mullinsprocess. Recent research indicates that tremie poured concrete does not flow as commonly thought in a drilled shaft. Instead of evenly rising and scouring of the filter cake on the walls of the borehole (if slurry displaced), a differential between the height of concrete inside and outside of the reinforcement cage has been observed. The development of pressure inside the cage (in the form of concrete head) serves to push the concrete through the cage in concert with a tumbling action flowing over the stirrups. In reality, design values of side shear based on empirical studies have unwittingly incorporated the presence of the filter cake despite the likely misconceived notion of the concrete's perceived flow patterns. The concern, therefore, it not the affect on side shear but rather the potential to encapsulate settled debris, slurry, or other deleterious material that degrades structural performance or durability. This paper quantifies this differential head and relates it to pertinent parameters of the drilled shaft design and/or construction process. BACKGROUND Wet concrete flow through steel reinforcement is a behavior dependent on many characteristics. However, the relative size of the coarse aggregate of the concrete and the minimum space between reinforcement bars is one of the most relevant factors. The ACI Code (2002) recommends the maximum coarse aggregate diameter be 3/4 of the clear spacing between rebar. Further, it waives this spacing requirement altogether, if concrete workability is good and consolidation (vibrating) methods may be employed. However, due to the nature of drilled shafts, consolidation methods are often not applicable. Therefore, recommendations call for a minimum cage spacing of 3 to 5 times the coarse aggregate diameter to allow for \"free\" flow of concrete past the reinforcement into annular area of the shaft FHWA (O'Neill and Reese, 1999). The first cited occurrence of differential head rising behavior was observed by Fleming and Sliwinski (1977). They briefly described a pour where, due to tight reinforcement spacing, tremie-placed concrete rose up inside the reinforcement cage and only after a critical head differential was reached, \"fell\" past the cage to the cover area. Brown (2003) offered a general discussion of this phenomenon and a case study. He suggested two types of problems may result in regard to rebar cages with small clear spacing due to high amounts of steel. The first involves sediment settling out of slurry onto the top of rising concrete. If the concrete does in fact slough off to the side, the sediment will as well. This accumulation may decrease bond that exists between concrete and the bearing formation. He suggests that even with clean slurry, concrete can be impeded enough to create voids outside the cage and likely diminish side shear capacity. Proceedings of the ADSC - GEO3 Construction Quality Assurance / Quality Control Conference Bruce, D. and Cadden, A. (eds), Dallas, Texas November, 2005, pp. 144-153. 2923 Deese and Mullins In the case study described by Brown, two shafts were excavated and poured. The first utilized standard Alabama DOT approved concrete which consisted of #57 crushed aggregate (1.9 cm (0.75 in.) maximum diameter) and a slump of 20.3 cm (8 in.). The minimum clear spacing of the reinforcement cage was 12.7 cm (5 in.). He stated the concrete was observed to flow around the tremie pipe and fall out, radially, toward the annular space of the shaft. The concrete was seen to fall through the cage to the cover region at a differential height of about 0.5 m (1.6 ft.). The second shaft, constructed identically, except for the reduction of the 1.9 cm (0.75 in.) aggregate to 1.27 cm (0.5 in.). There was much less falling out observed in this shaft. A one-tenth scale study to examine the flow of tremie-place concrete in drilled shafts was also recently completed (Mullins et al., 2004). Therein, a device, called a Lateral Pressure Cell (LPC), was developed to study various parameters of concrete flow. The LPC was constructed of clear Lucite pipe and incorporated lateral pressure transducers as well as a total weight load cell. A circular wire mesh of different clear spacings was used to simulate a reinforcing cage inside the lab-scaled drilled shaft. Cement mortar was used to simulate concrete. The primary objective of the LPC was to test the effect of concrete slump on the lateral pressure of the finished shaft, but it was discovered in these small tremie pours that the level of rising concrete inside of the wire mesh was higher than outside the wire mesh. This prompted researchers to run other series of tests to examine this phenomenon more fully. The subsequent tests incorporated three different cage spacings. A clear spacing to diameter ratio (CSD) defined the relationship between mortar (concrete) aggregates and reinforcement cage spacings. This ratio served to normalize the size of the rebar spacing to the largest aggregate in the concrete mix. It was discovered that the mortar in the LPC never rose uniformly as it was assumed. Instead, it would flow up, inside the rebar cage, until a critical point was reached, and fall through the clear spacing to the outside. It was noted that when the cage spacing was small (i.e. smaller CSD) the differential became higher indicating some correlation between CSD and head differential. Further, when the tremie was not perfectly centered (the more common field occurrence), the differential was more drastic with the level outside the cage behind the tremie being the lowest (Figure 1). This was confirmed by full scaled testing done in conjunction with Auburn University at the National Geotechnical Experimentation Site (NGES) in Opelika, Alabama. Figure 2 depicts the relationship found between CSD and head differential in the mortar pours as well as full scale testing completed (Mullins et al., 2004). This head differential phenomenon causes a flow in the borehole that is completely different from that idealized. The behavior not only brings into question the idea that the Proceedings of the ADSC - GEO3 Construction Quality Assurance / Quality Control Conference Bruce, D. and Cadden, A. (eds), Dallas, Texas November, 2005, pp. 144-153. 2934 Deese and Mullins Figure 2 CSD Ratio Versus Head Differential for LPC and NGES Testing Figure 1 Behavior of Rising Concrete in Tremie Poured Drilled Shaft Proceedings of the ADSC - GEO3 Construction Quality Assurance / Quality Control Conference Bruce, D. and Cadden, A. (eds), Dallas, Texas November, 2005, pp. 144-153. 2945 Deese and Mullinsrising concrete scours off the filter cake left by bentonite slurries, but also introduces the possibility of inclusions in the shaft due to concrete falling onto settled material in the borehole outside the cage after longer wait periods between concrete trucks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The discovery of a head differential in rising mortar between the inside and outside the reinforcement cage during LPC testing series spawned the desire to better define and understand the phenomenon. To this end, a field testing program was established to survey this behavior in full scale drilled shaft construction of various cage and aggregate combinations. The main objective of this testing was to quantify head differential behavior with variables such as CSD, rising concrete velocity, and fresh concrete properties. Multiple field visits across several sites were conducted to ascertain the amount of wet concrete head differential in various types of drilled shaft construction. In order to obtain an assortment of data, researchers deliberately chose sites with a large variety of shaft diameters and CSD ratios. The testing sites were: Essex Cement Silos, Crosstown Expressway, and Port Manatee, in addition to data collected from the NGES test site conducted in 2002. To quantify the head differential, researchers used a weighted tape system, similar to what drilled shaft inspectors use to measure rising concrete between buckets or trucks. Typically, two tapes were dropped before the first concrete was poured, one inside the reinforcement cage and one outside to take initial depths. During the pour, head differential readings (Figure 3) were taken every 30 seconds until the entire truck had been pumped into the shaft, then the final height was measured. In between the 30 second measurements, the weighted tapes were kept slightly above the level of rising concrete during the pour. This process was repeated until the entire shaft had been poured. To ensure precise measurement, the top of the temporary casing was typically used as a datum for both tapes. Essex Cement Construction of cement storage silos at Berth 219 in the Port of Tampa for Essex Cement Company called for 177 drilled shafts, 0.9 m (3 ft.) in diameter. The shafts were drilled to a depth of approximately 24 m (79 ft.) and were installed using full length temporary casing with a sidewall thickness of 1.3 cm (0.5 in.). The reinforcing cages were 15.85 m (52 ft.) in length and were designed to terminate at the top of the rock socket. Stirrup spacing and mix specifications yielded at CSD ratio of approximately 27 (minimum clear spacing was 50.8 cm (20 in.) and diameter of coarse aggregate was 1.9 cm (0.75 in.)). The construction site is shown in Figure 4. Proceedings of the ADSC - GEO3 Construction Quality Assurance / Quality Control Conference Bruce, D. and Cadden, A. (eds), Dallas, Texas November, 2005, pp. 144-153. 2956 Deese and Mullins Figure 3 Rising Concrete Level Measured Inside and Outside Reinforcing Cage Figure 4 Shaft Construction at Port of Tampa Proceedings of the ADSC - GEO3 Construction Quality Assurance / Quality Control Conference Bruce, D. and Cadden, A. (eds), Dallas, Texas November, 2005, pp. 144-153. 2967 Deese and MullinsThe concrete was poured via a pump truck and the tremie remained fully inserted in the shaft during the entire pour. Each shaft had a volumetric requirement equivalent to two concrete trucks (approximately 11.5 m (15 yd ), slump was approximately 24 cm (9.533 in.) on all shafts measured. The water table was near the surface. Successful collection of 4 data sets was completed for this site. It is interesting to note that head differentials varied regardless of a constant CSD ratio. This suggested that another variable, perhaps pour rate, could be key in affecting the wet concrete flow behavior. Upward velocity versus measured head differential trends were examined, although it was difficult to derive any trend from such a small amount of data. Crosstown Expressway Reversible Lanes Bridge Construction on the Crosstown Expressway Reversible Lanes Bridge project began in 2003 (Figure 5). The bridge was designed to facilitate three lanes of traffic westward from Interstate 75 into Tampa during morning hours then reverse flow eastward during the afternoon. The bridge utilizes a mono-pier foundation system, meaning that each column rests atop a single large diameter drilled shaft. The design loads for this bridge, which was being built above the existing Crosstown Expressway, required a large amount of reinforcement with tightly-spaced cages to resist overturning moments. Shaft diameters varied from 1.2 to 2.4 m (4 to 8 ft.) with depths of up to 24.4 m (80 ft.). CSD ratios for all shafts were 6 (minimum clear spacing was 15.2 cm (6 in.) and coarse aggregate diameter was 2.5 cm (1 in.)) with slumps ranging from 17.8 cm to 22.9 cm (7 to 9 in.). Figure 5 Drilled Shaft Construction at the Crosstown Expressway Proceedings of the ADSC - GEO3 Construction Quality Assurance / Quality Control Conference Bruce, D. and Cadden, A. (eds), Dallas, Texas November, 2005, pp. 144-153. 2978 Deese and MullinsThree shafts were investigated at two points along the route that offered a significant variation in the construction atmosphere. The first two shafts (piers 167 and 156) were 1.8 and 2.4 m (6 and 8 ft.) in diameter, respectively, and located within close proximity to an already existing roadway. The third shaft (pier 18) was 2.4 m (8 ft.) in diameter and positioned within the Palm River. Construction methods were similar to those used at the Port of Tampa in that a full length temporary casing was vibrated to the top of rock, the reinforcing cages were designed to terminate at the rock socket, and concrete was pumped from ready-mix trucks through a tremie. The larger diameter shafts required upwards of 15 concrete trucks (approximately 92 m (120 yd ) and 5 hours to complete33 which afforded several data sets per shaft. The CSD ratio versus head differential again clearly demonstrates no direct correlation between these two variables. Plotting the recorded head differential against the upward concrete velocity, however, reveals clear relation for these shafts of constant CSD ratios. This evidence suggested that perhaps a family of curves of head differential versus upward velocity exists for different ranges of CSD ratios. It is evident that another variable may affect the range of head differential fluctuation within a particular shaft. Also observed is the increase in differential range in shaft 167 which was twice as large as the range for shafts 18 and 156. While waiting between arrival of concrete trucks, differential measurements were taken in the stagnant boreholes. In time periods of up to one hour, it was observed that the wet concrete differential did not decrease appreciably. Port Manatee Construction of high mast security lighting at Port Manatee called for 6.1 m (20 ft.) deep, 1.5 m (5 ft.) diameter drilled shafts to support 36.5 m (120 ft.) tall steel poles. Due to height and wind requirements, these shafts had a CSD ratio of 8 (15.2 cm (6 in.) minimum clear spacing and the maximum coarse aggregate diameter of 1.9 cm (0.75 in.). The required concrete volume of these shafts called for two concrete trucks. As the site is comprised predominantly of dredged clay spoils, a natural slurry was used to maintain hole stability. The concrete was tailgated and a sectional tremie was used. This resulted in relatively low upward velocities at a lower CSD similar to data collected at the NGES site with Auburn University (Mullins et al., 2004). It can be seen in this series of data that similar head differentials exist for these shafts. Comparing the CSD ratio versus the measured head differentials produces a narrower band of results relative to the other sites, suggesting some correlation. However, the velocity versus head differential shows that a good correlation between increasing velocity and increasing head differential exists for upward velocities between 15.2 - 45.7 cm (0.5-1.5 ft.) per minute. Proceedings of the ADSC - GEO3 Construction Quality Assurance / Quality Control Conference Bruce, D. and Cadden, A. (eds), Dallas, Texas November, 2005, pp. 144-153. 2989 Deese and Mullins Figure 6 Summary of CSD Ratio Versus Head DifferentialSummary Figure 6 summarizes the head differential data from the Essex Cement, Crosstown, Port Manatee and the NGES sites as a function of the CSD. Clearly, the CSD is not the only parameter affecting the buildup of concrete head inside the reinforcing cage. Figure 7 shows the same data as a function of velocity for each group of common CSDs observed. A second order trend appears to exist for different CSD values, verifying the concept that head pressure is directly proportional to the square of the velocity head. Given a constant upward velocity, a drastic difference in head differential occurs as the CSD increases from 6 to 8; for CSD values above 8, however, the head differential is much less significant for all velocities. It should be noted that the head differential in the Crosstown drilled shafts did not appreciably decrease during wait time between concrete trucks, despite high slump concrete. Since there are few alternate configurations for a given reinforcement cage, it may be necessary to adjust the coarse aggregate size so as to minimize concrete build-up inside the cage. Therefore, using the results shown in Figure 7, any set of head differential data at a constant velocity will show the CSD limit below which should be avoided. Figure 8 shows that a minimum CSD of 8 is recommended. The FDOT has already taken steps to recommend a minimum CSD in the range of 10 as a result of this project's findings.

(eds), Dallas, Texas November, 2005, pp. 144-153. 30011 Deese and MullinsCONCLUSION The original basis for this research stemmed from anomaly formations in drilled shafts (such as soil inclusions) that had been noted to occur in the vicinity of the groundwater table (GWT) elevation. Although not found to be directly correlated to inclusion potential, the GWT does affect wet method construction by influencing the borehole stability. To this end, the project was expanded to observe concrete flow behavior with regards to anomaly formation. As a result, over 40 sets of data were taken in full-scale shafts at four sites. This testing was conducted to quantify head differential as a function of CSD ratio, rising concrete velocity, and wet concrete properties. The full scale testing showed that the CSD ratio was not the sole variable with regard to head differential. Instead, it was found that as upward velocity increased, larger head differentials could be observed. It was also apparent that shafts with similar CSD ratios showed similar head differentials with respect to velocity. The largest head differentials (upwards of 0.75 m) were observed for shafts with CSD ratios of approximately 6. Based on the conclusions derived herein, recommendations for changes in the pertinent sections of drilled shaft construction specifications were as follows: CSD > 8. Current FHWA recommendations suggest that a CSD ratio as low as 5 is reasonable. However, concrete flow observed (Figure 1) support an increase in this recommended value. This applies to structural, geotechnical, and materials engineers alike. As the size and configuration of rebar in drilled shaft cages cannot always be altered, smaller maximum aggregate diameter may be appropriate. Smaller sized coarse aggregate, such as #7 stone, should be considered for tremie-placed drilled shaft construction. This would help to increase the CSD and thereby lower the potential head differential that could develop. This means less concrete back pressure would be needed to adequately penetrate the cage. Where practical, this limit should be applied to the worst case spacing in the cage, such as spliced cage segments. Further topics of study include the continued development of a family of curves to correlate upward velocity in shafts with similar CSD ratios to head differential. Also, the potential relationship between radial velocity of concrete in the shaft versus the head differential should be investigated. This would further quantify the phenomenon of head differential and allow designers to create drilled shafts which not only have adequate strength, but also easily construct-able while minimizing the chance of anomaly formation.

An innovative instrumentation scheme was developed to allow assessment of the prewrap and postwrap corrosion state using linear polarization. This system is simple to install and eliminates theneed for wiring or junction boxes. The underwater wrap used a unique water-activated urethane resin system that eliminated the need forcofferdam construction. Linear polarization measurements taken before and after wrapping indicate that the corrosion rate in the wrappedspecimens is consistently lower than those in its unwrapped counterpart. These preliminary ndings are encouraging and suggest thatunderwater wrapping without cofferdam construction may provide a cost-effective solution for pile repair. DOI:10.1061/~ASCE!1090-0268~2005!9:2~136! CE Database subject headings: reinforced Bridge foundations Introduction Concrete's alkaline environment normally prevents steel from corroding by forming a passive oxide layer on its surface thatlimits access of oxygen and moisture. However, the combinationof high humidity and high temperature is lethal even for highquality concrete, as it allows chloride ions to penetrate to the levelof the reinforcement. When the chloride concentration reaches acritical threshold value of 0.6-1.2 kg Cl /m3, the passive layer is destroyed and corrosion is initiated ~Mindess et al. 2003!. Such conditions are commonplace in coastal regions of southeasternUnited States, where concrete piles corrode rapidly. The requirements for durable repair of corrosion-damage are daunting. All chloride-contaminated concrete must be removedand replaced with low shrinkage, low modulus, high creep, hightensile strength patch material having the same thermal expansionand oxygen permeability ~Vaysburd and Emmons 2000!. Because the boundaries of the chloride-contaminated region are not knownwith any precision, such conditions can rarely be met for repairscarried out under dry conditions; they are unrealizable for pilescorroding in tidal waters. Cathodic protection provides the onlyproven ~Scheffy 1981! means for ensuring durable repairs. How- ever, the cost of such repairs may not always be affordable. Fiber-reinforced polymers ~FRP!have the potential of being alower cost alternative that can match the performance of cathodi- cally protected piles. Cost is critically important and, indeed,lower costs were responsible for the selection of FRP in the rstplace. In 1994, the Vermont Agency of Transportation opted forFRP to repair corrosion-damaged columns because the berglasssystem led to an estimated cost savings of 35% over conventionalrepairs ~Tarricone 1995!. After nine years of service, repairs showed little sign of deterioration ~Graham, personal communi- cation, 2003!. This can be attributed to FRP's high tensilestrength, which can be aligned to withstand forces in any direc-tion, and its excellent durability. A recent state-of-the-art paper on using FRP for corrosion mitigation ~Sen 2003! found that the vast majority of the applica- tions to date are similar to those conducted in Vermont. Typically,bridge columns or bents corroded by salt-water spray from highspeed trafc or due to salt water trickling down leaky expansionjoints were repaired. Even where repairs were carried out in thetidal zone, they were done under dry conditions ~Neale and La- bossiere 1998!. Similar FRP repairs of prestressed piles using cofferdam con- struction were recently completed ~Shahawy et al. 2004!. How- ever, the high cost of cofferdam construction reduces FRP's com-petitiveness in the marketplace. As with the initial studyconducted in Vermont, FRP systems will only gain widespreadacceptance if their use leads to lower costs and improved perfor-mance as compared to conventional repairs. This paper describes a demonstration study in which full- sized, square prestressed piles were wrapped underwater usingFRP. The aim of the study was to assess the performance of thewrap and also to determine the ease with which it could be carried out. For this purpose, a robust instrumentation system was devel-oped that was simple to install yet eliminated the need for junc-tion boxes and wiring. The eld demonstration was the culmina-tion of a comprehensive laboratory study in which simulatedrepairs were carried out in a salt-water tank and their performanceevaluated through ultimate strength tests. A brief description ofthe ndings from this laboratory study is included for complete-ness. 1Associate Professor, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620. 2Professor, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620. 3PhD Candidate, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620. 4Research Associate, Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Univ. of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620.

In view of this,laboratory trials were carried out to simulate eld repairs and toevaluate their performance. Eleven one-third scale, 1.8 m long, 15 315 cm prestressed specimens were used in the laboratory study. The specimens wereprestressed using four 0.8 cm, 1,724 MPa strands and were castwith a 55.9 cm chloride-contaminated region ~3% chloride ion by weight of cement!. This type of specimen had been used in sev-eral previous projects ~e.g., Sen et al. 1999; Fischer et al. 2000!. Nine of the specimens were subjected to an acceleratedcorrosion regime using a constant current system to a targetedmetal loss of 25% veried by gravimetric testing. An underwater demonstration was conducted in which ve specimens were wrapped with the FRPimpregnated with the spe-cial water-activated urethane resin; one of the ve wrapped speci-mens was used for the qualitative assessment of bond. The re-maining six were used as unwrapped controls tested aseccentrically loaded columns ~two uncorroded, two at 25% steel loss, and two at 50% steel loss!.A3 31.8 m tank was lled with 3% salt water to a depth of 1.2 m ~Fig. 1!. Air Logistics of Pasa- dena, CA, who developed the water-activated resin system, pro-vided the materials and expertise for the demonstration. Following cure of the FRP material, the wrap was removed from one of the ve specimens to evaluate its bond with concrete.It came off relatively easily ~Fig. 2!as compared to wraps applied to dry surfaces, indicating that the bond was inferior. However,eccentric ultimate load tests indicated that the bond was sufcientto restore full capacity when compared with uncorroded controls~Fig. 3!.The remaining two wrapped specimens and their controls were subjected to additional accelerated corrosion to a targetedmetal loss of 50% and subsequently tested in the same manner.The results from these tests were similar to those obtained earlier.However, full restoration was not realized because of end failurecaused by corrosion outside the wrapped region. Nonetheless, theresults reafrmed the satisfactory performance of the wrap. Com-plete details may be found in the interim nal report ~Suh et al. 2004!. Field Demonstration A eld demonstration study was conducted to evaluate the effec-tiveness of two alternate systems: ~1!a \"dry\" wrap requiring cof- ferdam construction; and ~2!an underwater system. This paper focuses on the latter system. Information on the dry system maybe found in Shahawy et al. ~2004!.

Allen Creek Bridge is located in the city of Clearwater on the busy U.S. Highway 19, 2.3 km north of SR 686. Originally con-structed in 1951, its 4.57 m spans are supported by 50 350 cm reinforced concrete piles. In 1982, the bridge was widened toaccommodate six lanes of vehicular trafc. The widened sectionis supported by 35 335 cm piles. These are prestressed with eight 1.27 cm 1.86 GPa stress-relieved strands. An elevation view of the bridge is shown in Fig. 4. The waters from the creek flow east into Old Tampa Bay, which in turn joinsthe Gulf of Mexico to the south. The environment is very aggres-sive; all the reinforced concrete piles from the original construc-tion have been rehabilitated several times. At low tide, the waterlevel in the deepest portion of the creek was about 0.8 m. Maxi-mum high tide is about 1.9 m. This shallow depth meant that theunderwater wrap would not require divers and could be carriedout on a ladder.Prewrap Corrosion State Much of Allen Creek is knee-deep at low tide; therefore, it waspossible to access all the piles excepting those forming the mainchannel.Aprewrap inspection was carried out of the entire site toevaluate the corrosion state and also to select the piles that wereto be wrapped in the study. None of the piles displayed any vis-ible signs of corrosion. Nor was there any evidence of delamina-tion detectable by tapping the pile gently with a hammer. Several concrete cores were taken to determine the chloride variation in the cover. The rst sample was at the elevation cor-responding to high tide. The second was 0.9 m above high tide.The total chloride was determined every 25 mm down to the levelof the steel by the Florida Department of Transportation's StateMaterials Ofce. Results indicated that the threshold for corrosionwas easily exceeded at the high tide location. The chloride levelvaried between 3.98 and 3.32 kg/m 3. Values were much greater 0.9 m above high tide, where it was 7.43 kg/m3in the initial 25 mm cover, reducing to 0.51 kg/m3in the vicinity of the prestress- ing steel, 75 mm from the surface ~Lasa, personal communica- tion, 2003a!. This is typical of chloride variation observed in specimens exposed to tidal waters\u2014it is always much higherabove the high tide region.

It has been observed that encapsulation of chloride-contaminatedregions sometimes leads to an upward shift in the corrosion cells~Lasa, personal communication, 2003b !. Corrosion Instrumentation Field instrumentation for long-term monitoring is never a simpletask. This is especially so for piles because of accessibility prob-lems at high tide and the aggressive marine environment. Particu-lar attention must be paid to ensure that electrical contacts are notcorroded and moisture is not trapped inside junction boxes. More-over, accessibility of instrumentation ports makes them vulner- able to vandalism. Thus, making instrumentation as unobtrusiveas possible is a basic requirement for successful long-term moni-toring. In the study, a system suggested by Sagues ~personal com- munication, 2002! was used. It is simple to install and does not require any wiring or corrosion protection. Four piles\u2014B2, E2, F1, and G1\u2014were instrumented to deter- mine the prewrap corrosion state. The letters signify the position of the bent from the south abutment, and the numbers 1 and 2signify the row starting from the east.The piles in row 1 are alongthe outside row visible from the water looking west. Two of theinstrumented piles ~B2,G1!were retained as unwrapped controls. The remaining piles were used for monitoring the performance of Fig. 7.Marine growth on pile surface Fig. 8.Discovery of splice in piles E1 and F2 JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION \u00a9 ASCE / MARCH/APRIL 2005 / 139 Downloaded 15 Jul 2009 to 131.247.9.208.

Instrumentation was intended to allow monitoring of both the corrosion potential and the corrosion rate. Ground Connection Before any corrosion measurement can be made, an electricalconnection has to be made to the prestressing strands. A 5 cmdiameter hole was drilled above the high water line of the pile,about 0.3 m below the underside of the pile cap. The hole wasdrilled at the center of the pile where a strand was located. A 10cm long, 0.5 cm diameter 316 stainless steel rod was connected tothe strand by brazing. No special preparation was needed, becausethe strand was in good condition. The 316 stainless steel gradewas especially chosen because of its superior corrosion resistanceas compared to the less expensive 304 grade.Although a single connection would have sufced, four similar holes were drilled, one on each pile face, and identical brazed connections were made to ensure there was continuity between allthe strands. The 7.5 cm deep holes were then lled with mortar,leaving a 2.5 cm section of the stainless rod protruding from eachface. Potential readings can be taken by connecting a standardcopper-copper sulfate half cell to the negative terminal of a highimpedance voltmeter while attaching the positive terminal to thesteel strand via the stainless steel rods protruding from each face ~Fig. 5!. To ensure that potential measurements were consistently taken at the same location, a special template was prepared using aflexible plastic sheeting material. The width of the sheet equaledthe pile width, and holes were punched along a 15 cm grid wherereadings were to be taken. Sponges were attached to one side of Fig. 9.USF probe 140/ JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION \u00a9 ASCE / MARCH/APRIL 2005 Downloaded 15 Jul 2009 to 131.247.9.208. Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://pubs.asce.org/copyright 307the sheeting. This setup ensured that, once the template was cor- rectly positioned ~Fig. 6!, all readings could be quickly and accu- rately taken. This was very important, because measurementstook on an average 6 h, during which the tide could come in. Before readings could be taken, all marine growth covering the pile surface below the high water line ~Fig. 7!was scraped off and removed. When this was done, it was found that two of thepiles, E1 and F2, were spliced ~Fig. 8!. In addition, remnants of lifting hooks were detected from unexpectedly high corrosion po-tential readings on one face of instrumented pile B2 ~unwrapped control!. However, as there was a second \"perfect\" control, thiswas not a problem. Corrosion Rate Corrosion potential can only be measured where the concrete sur-face is accessible. Thus, it can be used for unwrapped controlspecimens and for the unwrapped portions of wrapped specimens.Corrosion potential is, however, only indicative of probability ofcorrosion. For example, readings more negative than 350 mVhave a 90% probability of corrosion. Thus, corrosion monitoringrequires measurement of the corrosion rate. This is determinedfrom linear polarization measurement. Linear polarization relieson the linear relationship between the corrosion current and itspotential when the equilibrium potential is perturbed by the ap-plication of an incremental current ~\"galvanostatic\"! or incremen- tal voltage ~\"potentiostaic\"!. Several portable devices are avail- able that can be used to make the measurement. In this study, aPR-Monitor Model 4500, manufactured by Cortest InstrumentSystems, Inc., was used. The measurement of the corrosion rate requires: ~1!a working electrode\u2014the element whose corrosion rate is to be determined;~2!a reference electrode to measure the electrical potential of the working electrode; and ~3!an auxillary or counter electrode to apply a current and complete the circuit. The PR-Monitor systemhas a built-in power supply and its own reference and counterelectrodes. The original plan was to use commercially available probes as had been used in other studies, e.g., Halstead et al. ~2000!. These probes have a connection cable containing wires from reference,counter, and working electrodes that can be directly connected toa PR-Monitor. However, the installation of such probes in the\"splash zone\" is problematic, requiring cofferdam construction.Moreover, extensive wiring would have to be run from the pilesand multiple junction boxes installed so that the length of thewiring would not exceed 6.1 m to ensure readings were accurate.In view of this, an alternative scheme was developed that elimi-nated both the need for wiring and potential corrosion problemsof electrical connections. USF Probe The corrosion rate is determined from the change in the corrosionpotential due to the application of an incremental current or volt-age.Therefore, any system that allows this change to be measuredcan be used as a probe. As mentioned earlier, in this study, asystem proposed by Sagues ~personal communication, 2002! was used. The system is simple to install and does not require anywiring or corrosion protection. Aschematic of the probe is shown in Fig. 9. It consists of a 0.5 cm diameter 316 stainless steel rod that is embedded relativelyclose ~1.9 cm! to the surface. Four rods were used to allow the corrosion rate of strands on each face to be determined. The rods Fig. 10. Schematic setup for linear polarization measurements using USF probe Fig. 11.

Half-cell potential at 1.22 m from pile cap before wrapping JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION \u00a9 ASCE / MARCH/APRIL 2005 / 141 Downloaded 15 Jul 2009 to 131.247.9.208.

Because no cofferdam was used, thelength of the rod was limited to 1.07 m, as it was the maximumlength that could be installed in the pile at low tide.This is shorterthan the 1.52 m wrapped length that extended nearly 0.5 m fur-ther. The corrosion rate determined from the testing correspondsto the 1.07 m length of the stainless steel rods. The probe determines the average corrosion rate, because all the strands are connected to each other ~Fig. 10!. Usually four sets of measurements were taken and the readings averaged. For eachset, the working electrode ~strand!, the reference electrode ~one stainless steel rod! and counter electrodes @the remaining three ~or two in the case of pile B2! are connected to each other# were connected to the PR-Monitor. The next reading is taken by alter-nating the positions of the reference and counter electrodes. Po-tentiostatic testing was used, in which the voltage was incre- mented in steps from 0 to 15 mV, with the current adjustedaccordingly. The slope of the change in potential and appliedcurrent gives the polarization resistance, R p. Concrete has a high resistance that needs to be considered in the calculation of polar-ization resistance. Usually, R pis corrected by subtracting the con- crete resistance from original Rp. The corrosion rate is found in the usual manner: the polariza- tion resistance, Rp, is related to the corrosion rate icorrby a pro- portionality constant given by the well-known Stern-Geary equa- tion. In this study, Bwas assumed as 26 mV. The polarized strand length was assumed to be the same as counterelectrode length~1.07 m!. The surface area of the strand was assumingthat each wire subtended a 240\u00b0 angle ~Fig. 11!. This gave a pe- rimeter of 5.3 cm for each strand. Because the assumed polarizedsteel length was 1.07 m and the pile has eight strands, the totalsurface area was calculated as 4,534 cm 2, neglecting the tie area~Suh 2002!. Prewrap Corrosion Results Weekly measurements of the corrosion state were planned. How-ever, because of rain, seven sets of measurements were madeprior to the wrap. Fig. 12 shows the variation of the half-cell potential @versus Copper Sulfate Electrode ~CSE!#measured 1.22 m below the pile cap before wrapping. All piles showed more negative thanTable 1.

Fig. 13 shows the distribution of initial half-cell potential value measured on the south face of eachpile. Values are lower near the top but increase with depth. Thesevalues corroborate the chloride levels discussed earlier. Prewrap corrosion rates were also determined from linear po- larization. Rates were small ~less than 0.2 mils per year!.They are shown with the postwrap corrosion rate plots later for conve-nience. Wrap Design The use of FRP for corrosion mitigation is relatively new, and noapproved design procedure is currently available. The wrap usedfor the underwater repair was designed to match an identicallayup requiring cofferdam that was part of this demonstration. Forthis wrap, a two-step design procedure was developed. In the rststep, a strain compatibilty analysis was carried out to restore ca-pacity for an assumed 20% metal loss. The ber layup requiredfor this strength gain was then checked to determine if it couldwithstand postrepair expansion due to deleterious materialtrapped inside the wrap. Complete details including numericalexamples may be found in Shahawy et al. ~2004!. Underwater Wrap The underwater wrap was carried out usingAquawrap 22-77 ~Air Logistics 2002!. This is a water-cured polyurethane resin systemthat can be used with woven glass fabric, unidirectional glassfabric, woven carbon fabric, and unidirectional carbon fabric.The Fig. 14.

Therst ever application of this technology was in the wrap of twouninstrumented reinforced concrete piles in North Carolina ~Ba- zinet et al. 2003!. This was the rst application on prestressedpiles. Two different bers\u2014glass and carbon\u2014were used for the un- derwater demonstration study. The ber layout was selected toensure that they provided comparable strength gain. Materialproperties as provided by the manufacturer are summarized inTable 1 ~Air Logistics 2002!. Inspection of Table 1 shows that carbon has a higher tensile strength and modulus as compared to glass. Both unidirectional,i.e., the bers provided tensile strength in one direction, and bi-directional, i.e., the bers provided strength in two orthogonaldirections, were used. The unidirectional bers were applied inthe longitudinal direction to increase flexural capacity. The bidi-rectional bers added capacity in the transverse or hoop directionto provide increased resistance against expansive forces set updue to steel corrosion. Fig. 16.

This was wrapped over spirally in the hoop direction by two continuous layers of bidirec-tional carbon ber material ~tensile strength 420.5 kN/m 32 layers=841 kN/m !. One layer of glass ber veil was applied to cover and protect the carbon. Aquawrap Glass Fiber Two layers of unidirectional glass ber ~tensile strength 420.5 kN/m 32 layers=841 kN/m the same sized strips as the carbon 30.5 3152.4 cm were applied on each face of the 35 cm pile. This was wrapped over spirally in the hoop direction byfour continuous layers of bidirectional sile strength 210.2 kN/m 34 layers=841 kN/m !. One layer of glass ber veil was applied to cover and protect the carbon. Surface Preparation The pile surface had to be smooth and sharp corners rounded toavoid stress concentrations.All marine growth was removed fromthe region to be wrapped with a scraper. Subsequently, two of thefour corners that were not rounded ~chamfered during casting! were ground down using an air-powered grinder ~Fig. 14!. This was a difcult operation, particularly for sections that were belowthe water line. Quick-setting hydraulic cement was used to ll anydepressions, discontinuities, etc., to provide a smooth surface.The entire surface was pressure washed using freshwater to re-move all dust and/or marine algae just prior to wrapping ~Fig. 15!. Application Carbon Pile F1 was wrapped using three layers of carbon ber ~one lon- gitudinal and two lateral!. First, an underwater epoxy adhesivewas applied to the prepared surface of the pile that was to bewrapped ~Fig. 16!. The FRP layout required one unidirectional, longitudinal layer that was overlaid by two bidirectional layers.The longitudinally aligned layer ~unidirectional! consisted of four 30.53152.4-cm-long strips, one on each face of the pile. Thesestrips were held in place by the already applied adhesive until thesubsequent wrapped layers could secure them. The bidirectionalcarbon layers were then applied starting at the top. These layerswere designed to be wrapped around the pile in a continuousfashion with easily manageable rolls ~e.g., 30.5 cm wide 35-6 m long!. After one full horizontal wrap around the pile, subsequent wraps were applied spirally downward with no over-lap until the lowest point was reached where the process wasreversed and the wrap was applied spirally upward to completethe second layer. No resin was required, because it was a prepreg.However, in regions above the water line, water was sprayed toallow the resin to cure. Upon completion of the structural wrap, asingle layer of a 25.4 cm wide prepreg berglass cloth ~veil!was spirally applied, moving from bottom to top, to consolidate thewrap and provide a better nish. A 5 cm ~2 in.!overlap was provided for this layer. The entire wrap was then secured with aplastic stretch lm, Stricture Banding. Fiberglass Pile E2 was wrapped using the berglass wrap. The procedure forwrapping was identical except that the ber layout required twounidirectional layers in the longitudinal directions and four bidi-rectional in the transverse direction. The wrap was allowed tocure for one day, following which the plastic stretch lm wasremoved and the wrap painted over using polyurethane-basedpaint to provide protection against ultraviolet radiation ~Fig. 17!. The entire operation went without a hitch and each pile took less than an hour to wrap. Witness Panels To allow future evaluation of the FRP/concrete bond, witnesspanels were prepared in which a 0.3 m length of the pile abovehigh tide was wrapped identically to the arementioned mannerfor future bond testing ~Fig. 18!. Postwrap Corrosion Monitoring The wrapping was completed in the second week of March 2003.For the rst month after wrapping, corrosion measurements weretaken weekly. Subsequently, they were taken every month. Thesemeasurements included corrosion potential and linear polarizationmeasurements, from which the corrosion rate was calculated.Temperature readings were also taken regularly. Results of the postwrap corrosion rate up to April 2004 ~413 days after wrapping! are shown in Fig. 19. Rates continue to be small. Fluctuations in the rates may be observed particularly forthe unwrapped controls, B2 and G1. This is most probably be-cause of temperature, which affects the corrosion rate. The per-formance of the carbon ber originally appeared to be better.However, in the most recent measurement, the performance ofcarbon and glass were comparable. The performance of both car-bon and glass are, however, better than those for the unwrappedcontrols. Conclusions This paper describes a eld demonstration study to evaluate theapplication of FRP for the underwater repair of corroding pre- Fig. 19.

A total of four full-sized 35 335 cm square pre- stressed piles were wrapped, two with carbon and two with glass. Two of these wrapped piles\u2014one carbon and one glass\u2014wereinstrumented to allow evaluation of their postwrap performance.Two other unwrapped piles serve as controls. Instrumentation al-lowed determination of the corrosion potential over the un-wrapped surface and the corrosion rate for the wrapped piles. Aunique feature of the instrumentation was the use of stainless steelrods with protruding hooks that eliminated the need of wiring andjunction boxes. Connections only require alligator clips. The study showed that underwater wrapping is a viable sys- tem. As with most FRP retrots, surface preparation is of para-mount importance. In this case, surface preparation requiredequipment capable of operating underwater to grind sharp cor-ners. Although initial eld tests on the witness panels indicatedthat the bond between the wet concrete and the FRP was rela-tively poor, laboratory tests showed the bond was sufcient torestore the full undamaged capacity. Corrosion rate measurementsindicate that the performance of the wrapped piles is consistentlybetter that the unwrapped controls. Underwater FRP repair technology is very new and is under development. The ease and speed with which the repairs weremade is very promising. In the study, each pile was wrapped inless than one hour. Corrosion monitoring data suggests that theperformance of the underwater wrapped piles is comparable tothose wrapped inside a cofferdam in a parallel study being con-ducted at the same site. All these portend well for the future ofthis technology. Acknowledgments This study was performed in cooperation and with funding fromthe State of Florida and U.S. Department of Transportation.

Over the past decade, several highway agencies completed demonstration projects in which FRP was used to repair corrosion damage on surfaces that were dry. These repairs have held up well and show little sign of deterioration. The availability of resins that can cure in water has made it possible to explore the application of FRP for the underwater repair of corrosion- damaged piles. This paper presents findings from three demonstration projects in which corroding reinforced and prestressed piles at two contrasting locations were repaired using two different FRP systems. Several piles were instrumented to allow long-term corrosion monitoring. The projects confirm th e feasibility of conducting underwater FRP repairs in tidal waters. Preliminary data suggests that the wrap leads to a reduction in the prevailing corrosion rate.

INTRODUCTION The high concentration of chloride ion in se awater allows it to penetrate to the level of steel even in high-quality concrete. As a result, the passive layer that normally protects steel is destroyed making corrosion of reinforcing or prestressing steel inevitable. This problem is particularly severe in tidal wate rs in sub-tropical en vironments where the combination of wet/dry cycles and high te mperature/high humidity can lead to rapid deterioration that necessitate costly repairs. Corrosion repairs are only durable if th e conditions responsible for the original deterioration are removed. This means that all chloride-contaminated concrete including the concrete behind the steel must be removed 1. Since the boundaries of the chloride contaminated region are not known with any precision this is daunting task even under dry conditions. For half-submerged piles in salt water this is a near impossibility. Not surprisingly, corrosion repair of piles is seldom durable with the exception of the Life Jacket system 2-3 developed through the pioneering efforts of the Florida Department of Transportation4-7. In this system, corrosion is stopped by integrating a sacrificial cathodic protection system within the repair. Unfortunately, the Life Jacket system may not always be affordable. In such instances there is a need for alternative, cost effective \"temporary\" repairs that ar e more durable than conventional 'chip and patch' type of repairs. Fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) offer the prospect of such a cost effective repair. Its lightweight, high strength and resistance to chemicals offer obvious cost advantages. In fabric form, it offers unprecedented flexib ility in construction. Moreover, as fibers can be oriented as required they can provide strength in any desired direction. This versatility 315 3has led to several research studies to inves tigate if FRP's strength and durability can be harnessed to successfully repair corrosion damage. It should be noted that the use of FRP for corrosion repair is deemed controversial. For example, ACI 440 Committee Guidelines8 states \" The application of FRP systems will not stop ongoing corrosion ...If steel corrosion is evident ....placement of FRP reinforcement is not recommended without arresting the ongoing corrosion and repairing any degradation to the substrate \". Economics has been largely responsible for disregarding this valid warning. When faced with the prospect of closing a br idge or a temporary FRP repair, highway authorities have usually opted for the latter. However, the performance of these \"temporary repairs\", in some cases extendi ng over ten years of service, has been exceptional 9. It should be noted that the vast majority of the studies attempted were carried out under dry conditions that are favorable for applying FRP. With the emergence of resin systems that can cure in water it has become possible to conduct corrosion repairs under water 10-11. This paper describes three field demonstration studies in which FRP repairs were carried out on corroding, partially submerged piles in tidal waters. An important element in all these applications was that several piles were fully instrumented to allow the corrosion rate to be monitored. Thus, these studies have the potential to yield data on the role FRP plays in slowing down the corrosion rate. Complete descriptions may be found elsewhere 12-15. This paper provides a brief overview to highlight some of the more important lessons learnt relating to the underwater application of the wrap. RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE This paper summarizes information from three separate field demonstration projects relating to an emerging new application of fiber reinforced polymers, namely underwater corrosion repair of piles. Corrosion of piles in tidal waters is a common problem and this information will be helpful in advancing the state of practice. PROBLEM STATEMENT The application of FRP for corrosion repair of piles serves th e dual purpose of enhancing flexural strength and providing confinement to withstand expansive forces set up by corrosion products. Thus, this application is part bond-critical and part contact- critical. As with any bond-critical application, su rface preparation is important; good bond requires the substrate to have an open pore structure to assure capillary suction of the epoxy. In underwater application, however, pores will be saturated with water or small 316 4marine organisms or algae. This is likely to adversely affect bond and alternative measures, e.g. bonding agents, may be requ ired to ensure satisfactory performance. The logistics of saturating FRP with resin and installing it in underwater applications are more complex given unpredictable environmental conditions. Wind, waves and tides play a critical role and unless they are factored in, wrapping is unlikely to be successful. New techniques have to be established for installation that minimizes the impact of these unfavorable conditions. As stated earlier, FRPs are only viable for co rrosion repair if they are cost effective. Given the high material cost, pile repairs must be properly engineered. Unfortunately, not all relevant information is available, e.g. relationship between corrosion and expansion. Safety is of paramount important issue and must be factored in all operations. Normal as well as extraordinary measures need to be taken to avoid potentially unfavorable conditions. Meticulous planning an d coordination is required to prepare for unexpected situations. DESIGNING CORRO SION REPAIR The role of FRP in pile repair is twofold: first to restore lost flexural capacity due to steel corrosion; second to provide resistan ce to withstand expansive forces caused by corrosion of steel. The former requires fibers to be oriented parallel to the direction of the reinforcing or prestressing steel, i.e. along the length, while the latter requires fibers in the transverse or hoop directio n, i.e. perpendicular to the st eel. This can be met either by using two different sets of uni-directional fibers one for each direction or preferably, by using bi-directional FRP material that requires less labor. An estimate of the required strength in the longitudinal direction may be made based on the steel cross-section that was lost by corrosion. A large body of laboratory test data relating ultimate capacity to metal loss is available in the published literature and this provides a means for developing a rati onal procedure. Alternatively, a conservative capacity loss may be assumed. This was th e case in the demonstration projects where capacity loss was assumed to be 20%. Currently, there is a lack of reliable information on transverse expansion caused by corrosion. Most available experimental transverse expansion data was obtained from accelerated corrosion tests that resulted in sy mmetric cracking. In practice, the combined action of wind and waves result in uneven chlori de penetration that inevitably results in asymmetric cracking. More importantly, the solubility of corrosion products from accelerated testing may be different. Thus, labo ratory data may not be appropriate. In view of this, a simplified procedure was developed 12, 16. In design, the expansion strain was assumed as 0.1% (approximately 3 times the ultimate concrete tensile strain assumed to be 10% of the ultimate concrete failure strain). 317 5Using the above assumptions, a two step design procedure was developed that was used in all the demonstration projects. In the first step, strain compatibility analysis was used to develop interaction diagrams to determine the number of FRP layers required to make up for the assumed shortfall in flexur al capacity due to corrosion. In the second step, the confining lateral strain provided by this strengthening was checked to ensure that this did not exceed an assumed expansion strain of 0.1%. Results obtained using this method were found to be reasonable. For th e bi-directional carbon fiber, only two FRP layers were required. Twice as many layers were required for fiberglass because of its lower strength and stiffness. DESCRIPTION OF DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS Three field demonstration studies were conducted at two contrasting sites. The first, Allen Creek Bridge, Clearwater is in shallow, relatively calm waters; the remaining two studies were carried out on piles supporting Gandy Boulevard bridges spanning Tampa Bay. The first of these two bridges is the Friendship Trails Bridge that is now a recreational trail for pedestrians and cyclists. The second is the Gandy Bridge. The waters of the Tampa Bay are much deeper and more turbulent than those of Allen Creek. These sites were selected because the en vironment is extremely aggressive. This was confirmed from chloride content analysis of concrete cores taken from the piles. The chloride content at the level of the reinfo rcement exceeded the th reshold required for corrosion to be initiated. FRP material -- Two differing systems were used in all three demonstration projects. One was a pre-preg, the other a wet lay up. The pre-preg system was from Air Logistics in which all the FRP material was cut to size, resin saturated in the factory and sent to the site in hermetically sealed pouches (Fig. 1). The wet lay up system used for wrapping the piles under wet conditions was from Fyfe. An additiona l wet lay up system was also used but this was carried out under dry conditions inside a cofferdam. For this reason, it is not discussed in this paper. Both carbon and fiberglass were used. Details of the properties of the fiber and the resin as pr ovided by the suppliers are summarized in Tables 1 to 4. Allen Creek Bridge Allen Creek Bridge is located on the bu sy US 19 highway connecting Clearwater and St. Petersburg, FL. The original bridge built in 1950 was supported on reinforced concrete piles driven into Allen Creek. In 1982, the bridge was widened and this new section was supported on 35 cm (14 in.) square prestressed piles. The waters from Allen Creek flow east into Old Tampa Bay that in turn joins the Gulf of Mexico to the south. The environment is very aggressive; all the reinforced concrete piles from the original construction had been rehabilitated several times. At low tide, the water level in the deepest portion of the creek is about 0.76 m (2.6 ft). Maximum 318 6high tide is about 1.89m (6.2 ft). This shallow depth meant that the underwater wrap could be carried out on a ladder. Preparatory work -- Pile surfaces were covered with marine growth (Fig. 2) that had to be scraped off. Additionally, two of the four corners that were not rounded but chamfered had to be ground using an air-powered grinder. This was a difficult operation particularly for sections that were below the water line. A quick-setting hydraulic cement was used to fill any depression, discontinuitie s and provide a smooth surface. Just prior to wrapping the entire surface was pressure washed using freshwater to remove all dust and marine algae. Instrumentation -- Instrumentation was installed to allow linear polarization and corrosion potential measurements to be made. An innovative instrumentation scheme was developed that eliminated the need for wiring and junction boxes 14. This was an important consideration since the piles were located in relatively shallow waters that were accessible on foot. Several piles supporting the structure had been defaced and the probability of vandalism was very real. FRP wrapping -- Two different schemes using two different materials were evaluated. In each scheme four piles were wrapped with two other instrumented piles serving as controls. In the first scheme, cofferdam construction was used and the piles wrapped using a bi-directional FRP in a we t lay up under dry conditions. As this was wrapped under 'perfect' conditions, its performance provided a means for evaluating piles that were directly wrapped in water us ing a new water activated resin (Fig. 3). The latter scheme was a pre-preg system developed by Air Logistics. The pre-preg was easy to install since all the material came in labeled hermetically sealed packets. After applying an initial e poxy layer, the packets were opened according to the layout scheme and the FRP material applied. A shrinkage wrap was applied at the end to allow the FRP to cure. On an average, it took between 30 minutes to 45 minutes to wrap a pile over a 1.5 m depth depending on the number of layers of material that had to be applied. Friendship Trails Bridge This is the oldest of the Gandy Boulevard bridges crossing Tampa Bay. It was originally constructed in 1956 and was slated for demolition in 1997. Thanks to community activists, the bridge was saved, refurbished and rehabilitated. In 1999, the bridge was re-opened as a pedestrian bridge and re-christened as the \"Friendship Trails Bridge\". The 4.2 km (2.6 mile) structure is now the longest over-water recreational trail in the world. The bridge has 275 spans supported by 254 reinforced concrete pile bents and 22 column type piers located at the main channel crossing. Seventy seven percent of the 254 piers supporting this bridge have needed to be repaired indicating that the environment is very aggressive. 319 7Preparatory work -- All piles wrapped were 50.8 cm x 50.6 m (20 in. x 20 in.) reinforced concrete piles and wrapped over a depth of 1.5 m that extended all the way to the underside of the pile cap. The waters ar e approximately 4.88 m (16 ft) deep. This meant that ladders could no longer be used to apply the FRP in this situation. An innovative scaffolding system was designed and fabricated. It was lightweight, modular yet sufficiently rigid when assembled to support 4-6 people. The scaffolding was suspended from the pile cap and extended 2.74 m (9 ft) below. Its mesh flooring provided a secure platform around the pile that allowed the wrap to be carried out unimpeded in knee deep waters (Fig. 4). Instrumentation -- Unlike the Allen Creek Bridge where vandalism was a real concern, the piles of the Friendship Trails Bridge are located in deeper and more turbulent waters. Moreover, as the majority of the piles supporting this bridge had been repaired and some were instrumented, the element of novelty was absent making vandalism less likely. In view of this, an instrumentation system developed by the Florida Department of Transportation was selected. This required both wiring and junction boxes. The scheme uses rebar probes (Fig. 5) that are installed at different elevations close to the reinforcing steel. Changes in th e direction of the corrosion current between these locations can indicate if the FRP is working as expected. Reductions in the measured current compared to unwrapped cont rols were also expected to provide an index of the efficacy of the FRP wrap. The drawb ack with this system is that it takes time for the equilibrium state around the probe to be attained. Until this time, data may not be meaningful. FRP wrapping -- Two different FRP systems were used. One was the same pre-preg system with a water-activated resin used in the Allen Creek Bridge. The other was Fyfe's system that used resins that cure in water. The pre-preg system was used to wrap four piles - two using carbon and two using glass. The wet-lay up system from Fyfe required on-site saturation of the fibers. Two piles were wrapped with fiberglass using this system. Of the two, one was an experimental FR P system that combined wrapping with a sacrificial cathodic protection system. Two other unwrapped piles in a similar initial state of disrepair were used as controls to evaluate the performance of the wrapped piles. Application was facilitated through the use of a scaffolding system mentioned earlier (Fig. 6). The pre-preg system was applied as in the Allen Creek Bridge and posed no problems. The Fyfe system was more challenging since the FRP material had to be saturated on-site. Access to foundations of an adjacent bridge provided a convenient staging post for the on-site impregnation (Fig. 7). On an average the operation took 90 minutes to complete. Gandy Bridge The Gandy Bridge built in 1970's connects St. Petersburg to Tampa. The bridge has approximately 300 piers comprising five or eight prestressed concrete piles with 50.8 cm x 50.8 cm (20 in x 20 in.) cross section. The original plan was to just wrap one 320 8heavily corroded pile (Fig. 8). Later, the scheme was revised to include three piles. An additional unwrapped but instrumented pile served as control (Fig. 9). Preparatory work -- Though the scaffolding system used at the Friendship Trail Bridge provided a safe and stable working space, it required at least four to five people to install and move because of its large size and weight. In view of this, a new scaffolding system was developed that was geared towards wrapping individual piles. This was in two parts that were readily assembled in the field and suspended from the pile cap using steel chains rather than welded angles used earlier. The system could be installed by 2-3 people easily and quickly, and provided a good working space for 3 people (Fig. 10). Prior to applying the wrap, the severely damaged pile (Fig. 8) was repaired. The surface of the exposed concrete and steel was cleaned by sand blasting and the damaged section restored using an underwater patch material, Tyfo PUWECC, manufactured by FYFE Co. LLC. All procedures recommended by the manufacturer were followed. Instrumentation -- Since it was expected that FDOT would take over monitoring of the performance of the piles after the project was over, the sa me rebar probes used in the Friendship Trails Bridge were retained. Ad ditionally, a commercial probe was used. This was relatively bulky in size but could just be accommodated within the cover. The benefit of the new system was it also allowed the corrosion rate to be monitored. Rebar probes were positioned at four different levels for measuring current flow and commercial probes were installed at two levels for perf orming the linear polarization measurement. FRP wrapping -- The same two systems used in the Friendship Trails Bridge were also used in the Gandy Bridge. The opera tion was identical excepting that the system used for saturating the fibers for the Fyfe system was modified. Instead of using the saturating machine, hand methods were used as they were found to be speedier and equally effective. The entire operation went smoothly and the wraps were installed in about an hour each (Fig. 11). DISCUSSION The use of FRP for corrosion repair of piles in tidal waters poses many problems relating to surface preparation, wrapping, in strumentation and monitoring long term performance. In this study the modus operandi was modified to accommodate the contrasting demands of the different sites and also the differing conditions of the piles. Fig. 12 shows the condition of the wrapped piles in the Allen Creek Bridge after almost two years. The FRP appears to be in reasonable condition although marine growth has formed on the surface of the wrap. This is borne out by corrosio n rate measurements shown in Fig. 13. These cover a period of nearly two years from the time the piles were first wrapped in March 2003. Fig. 13 shows the average corrosion rate measurements in unwrapped controls, and piles wrapped under dry (cofferdam) and wet conditions. The variation in temperature is also shown. Inspection of Fig. 13 shows that the corrosion rate in the wrapped piles is 321 9low and stable while that of the unwrapped piles showed continual fluctuation possibly due to environmental factors such as temperature and tide change. According to criteria proposed by Clear17, corrosion is not expected in the wrapped piles and it may occur in 10-15 years in the unwrapped piles. Fig. 13 also shows that the corrosion rates for the piles wrapped under dry or wet conditions are quite similar. This suggests the underwater epoxies performed well and the piles are being provided comparable protection. Since strengthening is a bond critical application, bond tests are planned before the project ends to evaluate the relative quality of the bond in the two systems. CONCLUSIONS This paper provides a brief overview of three demonstration projects in which instrumented reinforced and prestressed piles were wrapped using different FRP systems. Wrapping was carried out directly under water using ladders and innovative scaffolding systems suspended from the pile cap. The res earch team was pleasantly surprised at the ease with which the underwater wrapping was carried out. Procedures that worked best can be summarized as: 1. Transverse wrapping is easiest - longitu dinal pieces are awkward to handle and difficult to position. Bi-directional material is best. 2. Scaffolding ensures safety and simplifies installation. 3. Pre-preg is easier to use. On-site FRP saturation can be problematic. 4. High winds and high tides should be avoided. The instrumentation system used in the Allen Creek Bridge, Clearwater requiring no wiring and junction boxes has proved to be robust and effective. Corrosion rate measurements over 2 years suggest that the performance of piles wrapped under dry conditions, i.e. using cofferdam construction and wet conditions was comparable. This could be because the measured corrosion rates are still low. Underwater wrap for pile repair is relatively new and many innovations may be expected in the future that will make applic ations simpler. Should repairs prove durable, highway agencies will have access to anothe r method of pile repair that may be economical in particular situations.

Tests can be constructed at full scale withoutwaiting for an earthquake. In this extreme environment, pore pressuretransducers must survive transient blast pressures of 41.4 MPa (6,000 psi)yet have enough resolution to measure residual pore pressures of/H115500.69 kPa (0.1 psi). Three transducer types were evaluated under these demanding conditions, and the piezoresistive transducer was found tobe the most robust. These sensors were repeatedly subjected to extremeblast pressures and vibration, but they still provided accurate time his-tories of residual pore pressure. Although these piezometers are moreexpensive than other types, installation techniques allowed them to berecovered and reused in subsequent tests and thus reduced overall costs.These pore pressure sensors make it possible to dene the extent of theliqueed zone during blast liquefaction experiments and to understand the soil behavior during cyclic loading of deep foundations. During the past several years, a procedure has been developed to simulate the earthquake-induced liquefaction process by using con-trolled blasting. This procedure makes it possible to conduct full-scale testing inside a liqueed soil volume to evaluate foundationbehavior and soil improvement techniques without waiting for anearthquake or relying on scale models. This procedure has now beenused at a number of sites to evaluate a variety of issues. For example, testing on Treasure Island in California's San Francisco Bay evalu ated the lateral resistance of piles and pile groups in liqueed sand (1, 2). Testing in Charleston, South Carolina, evaluated the lateral resis-tance of an 8.5-ft-diameter drilled shaft in liqueed sand for theCooper River Bridge and included lateral statnamic loading afterblasting (3 ). Tests in Vancouver, British Columbia, evaluated the ability of prefabricated vertical drains to dissipate pore pressure andprevent liquefaction (4 ). Testing in Maui, Hawaii, evaluated the liquefaction resistance of coralline sands ( 5). Testing in Hokaido, Japan, evaluated the lateral resistance of sheet pile walls and pilegroups subjected to a blast-induced lateral spread after liquefaction(6). Future studies will evaluate the reduction in axial capacity and the development of downdrag forces on piles after liquefaction. A critical component in the success of this new eld testing ap- proach has been the development of pore pressure sensors that canwithstand the high transient blast pressure produced by explosivecharges and still record the relatively small residual excess pore pres-sure with acceptable accuracy and resolution. The piezometers are useful in conrming the development of liquefaction after blastingand in evaluating the pore pressure distribution during foundationtesting. A number of sensor types and installation procedures havebeen used, and successful techniques have been developed throughextensive research. This paper describes the pore pressure sensors and installation pro- cedures that have proven successful in full-scale blast liquefactionexperiments. In addition, the results from several experiments willbe described to show the value of the pore pressure measurementsystem in understanding the soil behavior in these experiments. PORE PRESSURE SENSORS AND INSTALLATION TECHNIQUES Potential SensorsOn the basis of empirical relationships, a pore pressure sensor might be subjected to peak transient pore pressures as high as 41.4 MPa(6,000 psi) at a distance of 5 ft from a 0.45-kg explosive charge. How-ever, it is desirable to be able to measure the residual pore pressurewith an accuracy of \u00b1 0.69 kPa (0.1 psi), because liquefaction is usu- ally a phenomenon that occurs at relatively shallow depths. Althoughit is possible to obtain a variety of pore pressure sensors that can mea-sure accurately within one of these pressure ranges, it is impossibleat present to nd a sensor that can measure accurately within bothpressure ranges. If a sensor is selected to measure the high pressures,the resolution at low pressures is generally inadequate. Therefore, itis generally necessary to select a sensor that can measure with ade-quate resolution at the low pressure range and then ensure that thesensor can survive the highest pressures but not necessarily measurethem. Although no stock transducer met all these requirements,several possible transducers were evaluated. These transducers in-cluded a piezoresistive transducer, a vibrating wire transducer. Piezoresistive Transducer The stock transducer that came closest to meeting the various re-quirements was the P-100MV model produced by Sensotec, Inc.,Pore Pressure Measurement in Blast-Induced Liquefaction Experiments Kyle M.

Design modifications specifically made for these tests produced a model that has a pressure range from 0 to 6.9 MPa (0 to 1,000 psi) with the ability to withstand pressures sixtimes the maximum pressure. The resolution is 0.01% of the fullrange or 690 Pa (0.1 psi). The transducer is equipped with 30.5 m(100 ft) of waterproof cable that had been hermetically sealed to theinstrument. The sensing element in this transducer is a thin circular silicon diaphragm embedded with four nearly identical piezoresistors. Thesilicon is an ideal material for the diaphragm, because it is a perfectcrystal and has extremely good elasticity. This means that the ma-terial can be strained, and it will always return to the original form.The embedding of the piezoresistors in the silicon eliminates prob-lems that have occurred with the bonding of dissimilar materials,such as thermoelastic strain, complex fabrication, and degradationof the bond (7 ). When a pressure is applied to the diaphragm, itRollins, Lane, Dibb, Ashford, and Mullins 211 bends and induces a strain in both the diaphragm and the resistors.This strain causes a change in the resistance, which can then be usedto determine the deflection of the diaphragm and the pressure requiredto cause the change. The transducer by itself cannot be installed into the ground with- out signicant damage. Therefore, a nylon casing with a conical tipwas designed to protect the instrument during installation. A nyloncasing also was used to minimize the difference between the unitweight of the soil and the sensor. The casing used for this trans-ducer was developed with the assistance of Professor T. LeslieYoud at Brigham Young University and was patterned after a cas-ing used in measuring liquefaction at the Wildlife site (8 ). The cas- ing, shown in Figure 1 b,consists of two parts: the sleeve and the tip. The sleeve is a solid nylon cylinder with the primary purpose ofprotecting the transducer. A rope is attached through a hole in thesleeve to help during installation and retrieval of the transducer.FIGURE 1 (a ) Piezoresistive pressure transducer, ( b) transducer inserted into nylon cone tip housing with access holes to water, and ( c) nylon cone tip mounted on push rod with electric cable and retrieval rope. (c) (a)( b) 334The tip contains 125-mm-diameter holes leading to a central cav- ity. This allows water to be in contact with the tip of the transducerso that the change in water pressure can be measured. The holes inthe tip are stuffed with cotton to prevent sand from entering the tipduring installation, allowing water pressure to be transmitted to thetransducer. Vibrating Wire Transducer The vibrating wire transducer was a Rocktest, Inc., model PWP piezometer. The transducer has a nominal range of 0 to 690 kPa(0 to 100 psi) with a resolution of 0.1% of full scale or 690 Pa (0.1 psi). Although the transducer was tested at a pressure equal to150% of full scale by the manufacturer, a vendor indicated that thetransducer had withstood pressures of 6.9 MPa at a test site nearMt. St. Helens by orienting the portholes so they faced away fromthe blast. The pore pressure on the diaphragm is related to the nat-ural frequency of the vibrating wire in the sensor. The natural fre-quency is obtained by plucking the wire and timing 100 cycles ofvibration. The vibrating wire sensor was inserted into a stainless steel cylin- der with a cone tip that could be pushed into the ground using EWdrill rods. Three portholes were located just above the tip and con-tained lters. The sensor was attached to a cable that was hermeticallysealed to the instrument. Electrical Resistance Sensor The electrical resistance piezometer was based on a Honeywell/DataInstruments model ABHP-10k strain gauge pressure transducer withtwo thermally matched strain gauges bonded to the inner face of astainless-steel diaphragm. The transducer has a nominal range of 0to 69 MPa (0 to 10,000 psi), a burst pressure of 345 MPa (50,000 psi)or ve times the full-scale pressure, and is capable of withstanding apeak shock of 50 g, where gis the acceleration due to gravity. There- fore, the sensor should be capable of withstanding blast-inducedtransient pressure and shock. On the downside, the transducer has amanufacturer's reported accuracy of only 0.25% of full scale, whichis 172.5 kPa (25 psi). However, when used in conjunction with theMEGADAC data collection system as in this study, the device canindicate pressure to the nearest 6.9 kPa (1 psi). The transducer washoused in a direct burial steel casing affixed to a 150-mm-long nylonporous element that allowed access to the groundwater. Aside fromproviding a convenient connection, the steel housing also was in-tended to isolate the edge of the instrumented diaphragm from un-desirable lateral soil pressure, which could cause strain in the plainof the diaphragm. Installation and Extraction Procedures Piezoresistive Piezometer A standardized procedure was used to ensure that accurate pore pres- sure measurements were made. If an air bubble were present in thetip, errors would occur, and the data would be useless; therefore,212 Transportation Research Record 1936 every effort was made to eliminate air bubbles and saturate the probe.After new cotton was inserted into the holes, the tips were boiled tosaturate the material and remove the air. The transducer was thensubmerged in deaired water, and the air bubbles were tapped out.While still submerged, the tips were screwed onto the end of thetransducer, and then that unit was screwed onto the sleeve. Beforethe cone assembly was removed from the deaired water, a rubbermembrane was placed around the casing to keep the tip saturatedand prevent contamination in the drilling mud until the transducercould be pushed into the ground. The installation process began by drilling 100- to 125-mm holes at desired locations using rotary mud, drilling to a depth that wasapproximately 0.3 m short of the desired sensor depth. The drill bitwas then replaced by a push rod with the transducer tted on the end,as shown in Figure 1c. Using the rope to hold the transducer tight against the push rod, the assembly was lowered into the hole. A notchcut along the length of the push rod accommodated the cable, whichwas fed into the hole. When the bottom of the borehole was reached,the cone tip was pushed into the soil approximately 0.3 m to thedesign depth, causing the rubber membrane to rupture. This proce-dure enabled the apparatus to be completely encased in the soil andto remain saturated during installation. The hole was bored to re-duce the distance that the transducer needed to be pushed into the ground; however, it also created a large void and provided a drain-age path to the surface. Therefore, the borehole was filled withbentonite drilling mud. Because of the high cost of the piezoresistive transducers, their recovery after the testing was important. After the blast-inducedliquefaction, sand typically flowed into the boreholes when thinslurry was used in the borehole. To retrieve the piezometers in thiscase, water jetting is used to reopen the hole and extract the trans-ducer. When the piezometer was located more than approximately8 m below the ground surface, it became very difficult to success-fully extract the piezometer using the jetting technique. In sub-sequent tests, a thicker drilling mud (25 lb/100 gal) was used in theboreholes above the sensor. In this case, the sand did not flow intothe hole, and the sensors could be successfully extracted simply bypulling the piezometer out of the ground. With the bentonite slurryapproach, piezometers were successfully extracted to depths of upto 13.5 m. Vibrating Wire Piezometer The vibrating wire sensors were installed using essentially the sameprocedure as described for the piezoresistive sensors. However, theEW rod used to push the piezometer into the ground was left attachedto the piezometer so that it could be removed after the test blast. Theextraction procedure was successful in all cases. Electrical Resistance Piezometer The electrical resistance piezometers were installed by drilling to thedesired depth, inserting a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) casing to stabi-lize the hole, lowering the saturated piezometer to the bottom of thehole, and then extracting the PVC while backlling the hole withapproximately 1.3 m of sand. Because the piezometers were of lower 335cost, no effort was made to extract the piezometers from the ground after the blast-induced liquefaction. Piezometer Evaluation Field evaluations of the vibrating wire and piezoresistive piezome- ters were conducted at a test site on Treasure Island in San FranciscoBay before the blast liquefaction experiments involving full-scaletest foundations were conducted. Because the vibrating wire trans-ducer could be purchased at approximately one-third the cost of amore robust piezoresistive transducer, considerable cost savingscould be realized if the vibrating wire transducer proved successful. Vibrating Wire Piezometers The layout of Test Area A involving vibrating wire piezometers isshown in Figure 2. Three vibrating wire piezometers were installedto a depth of 3.66 m below grade along a line at a spacing of 2.13 mon center. Binary explosive charges (Kinepak), also located at adepth of 3.66 m, were then detonated on a line beyond the outerpiezometers, as shown in Figure 2. The soil prole consisted ofpoorly graded sand (D 50=0.2 mm) with a water table 0.85 m below the ground surface. The unit weights were approximately 19.95 and19.47 kN/m 3above and below the water table, respectively. Although the vibrating wire sensors offered the potential for signicant costsavings, their performance was unsatisfactory. The rst blast (Blast1), destroyed the transducer at a distance of 2.13 m from the 0.50-kgcharge, and the third blast (Blast 3), destroyed the transducer at adistance of 1.98 m from the 0.25-kg charge. These results disquali-ed the vibrating wire sensor from further use in the testing pro-gram. Pressures from both blasts were sufficient to permanentlydeform the diaphragm.Rollins, Lane, Dibb, Ashford, and Mullins 213 Despite the failure of the transducers at the higher peak pressures, the sensors that did survive recorded the residual pore pressure dur-ing Blast 1, as shown in Figure 3. The peak residual pore pressureat each piezometer location (u) was divided by the initial verticaleffective stress ( o) to obtain the excess pore pressure ratio (R u). An Ruvalue of 1.0 indicates full liquefaction. The peak residual Ruval- ues for Blast 1 were 0.54 and 0.31 at a distance of 4.3 and 6.4 m,respectively from the 0.50-kg blast charge. Piezoresistive Piezometers The layout of piezoresistive piezometers and blast holes in TestArea B is shown in Figure 4. Three piezoresistive piezometers wereinstalled in a line at a spacing of 2.13, m on center, to a depth of 3.66m below grade, as was the case in Test Area A. Explosive charges,located at a depth of 3.66 m below grade, were detonated at a dis-tance of 2.13 m on the line beyond the outer piezometer in Blasts 4and 5. All three piezometers survived the blast and recorded peakresidual excess pore pressure ratios of 0.9, 0.57, and 0.28. Because of the success of the piezometers for the single 0.50 kg blast, an additional test was performed in which two 0.75-kg charges were detonated simultaneously at a distance of 2.13 m from the rstpiezometer. After approximately 2 min, this blast was followed bythe simultaneous detonation of two additional 0.75-kg charges, asshown in Figure 4. Time histories of the residual excess pore pres-sure ratios (R u=u/ o) measured by the three piezometers during Blast 6, are shown in Figure 5. In all cases, the peak residual excesspore pressure ratio increased to approximately 1.0 immediately afterthe blast and then gradually dissipated with time. The second deto-nation once again brought the excess pore pressure ratio to approx-imately 1.0, after which the ratios dissipated to approximately 0.1after about 30 min. As expected, the dissipation rate was highest atgreater distances from the blast charge where radial drainage wasmore pronounced. The dissipation rate for Blast 6 (Figure 5) was Scale mBlast 3 (W=0.25kg)Blast 2 (W=0.25kg) Blast 1 (W=0.50kg) Vibrating Wire Transducers Blast Points0.0 3.0 1.0 5.0 FIGURE 2 Layout of Test Area A for evaluating vibrating wire piezometers at Treasure Island, San Francisco.

The noise evident in the plotswas traced to a bad board, not the piezometers themselves. Electrical Resistance Sensors The response of the piezometer was evaluated by installing oneelectrical resistance piezometer and one piezoresistive piezometerat opposite corners of a 1.83-m square to a depth of approximately214 Transportation Research Record 1936 3 m. At the other two corners of the square, 0.52-kg explosivecharges were placed at a depth of 3 m and backfilled with sand.Two blast tests were then conducted by detonating each chargeindividually at the test site in Tampa, Florida, which consisted ofsilty sand with a water table approximately 0.3 m below the groundsurface. During the test blasts, both piezometers appeared to per-form with comparable success; however, the noise associated withthe electrical resistance piezometer was much larger than that forthe piezoresistive piezometer. To minimize this problem, it wasrecommended that sampling be performed at a minimum rate of1,000 Hz and that an averaging procedure be used for each data Scale mBlast 5 (W=0.50kg)Blast 4 (W=0.50kg)Blast 6 (W=0.75kg) Blast 6 (W=0.75kg) (1.67 min. delay) Piezoresistive Transducers Blast Points0.0 3.0 1.0 5.0 FIGURE 4 Layout of Test Area B for evaluating piezoresistive piezometers at Treasure Island.

Both piezometers indicated that liquefaction was achieved during the test blast. Although the electrical resistance piezometers performed well during the test blasts, during subsequent full-scale testing involving repeated blasting and larger charge weights (1 to 2 kg), the electri-cal resistance piezometers experienced a very high failure rate. Inmany cases, the transducers underwent a large, but undeterminable,offset in pressure after the test blast and showed only minor pressuredissipation with time. In fewer cases, the piezometer indicated thatdissipation was occurring and that the pore pressure would nallystabilize at a new but higher static pressure value. These failureswere attributed to insufficient lateral isolation of the instrumenteddiaphragm, which would therefore indicate a change in lateral soilpressure but of an undetermined magnitude. APPLICATIONS FOR BLAST LIQUEFACTION TESTING Blast Liquefaction Testing of Pile Group at Treasure Island Blast liquefaction testing was performed in 1999 at a test site on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay to evaluate the lateral resis-tance of pile groups and drilled shafts. The ultimate goal of theresearch was to develop \" p-y\" curves to dene the lateral resistance of the liquefied sand as a function of lateral pile deflection; thedevelopment of these curves is described elsewhere (1, 2). The lay-out of the test foundations, blast holes, and pore pressure transduc-ers is shown in Figure 6. The test foundations consisted of a0.9-m-diameter cast-in-steel-shell (CISS) pile and a nine-pile groupof 0.324-m-diameter steel pipe piles driven open ended. A high-speed hydraulic actuator was placed between the two foundationsso they could react against each other. Eight 0.5-kg explosivecharges were arranged in a ring around each test foundation andwere detonated two at a time with a delay of approximately 250 msRollins, Lane, Dibb, Ashford, and Mullins 215 to produce a volume of liqueed sand around the test foundations.Vertical arrays of piezoresistive pore pressure transducers wereinstalled at locations adjacent to each test foundation and at severaldistances beyond the foundations in the direction of loading, asshown in Figure 6. These transducer arrays were designed to denethe extent of the liqueed zone and to evaluate the variation of thepore pressure as cyclic lateral load was applied by the hydraulicactuator. Generally, the transducers performed very well during the inves- tigation. Only four of the 30 transducers failed to function properly. Three of the piezometers failed because of cable damage duringinstallation, which allowed water to reach the transducers, whereasthe fourth was damaged by the transient blast pressure that appar-ently exceeded 41.4 MPa (6,000 psi) for this piezometer, which waslocated only 1.5 m from one of the charges. Time histories of the excess pore pressure ratio along with the total lateral load are provided in Figure 7 at four depths near thenine-pile group and at four depths approximately 3.2 m in front ofthe row of piles in the group for the rst 10 min after blasting. Dur-ing this time interval, the average excess pore pressure ratios weretypically greater than 95% around the test foundations except atdepths of approximately 0.76 and 1.52 m, where the interpolatedratio was approximately 76% and 85%, respectively. These ratiosdecreased to approximately 85% to 95% at a distance of 3.2 m (9.9pile diameters) away from the pile group and approximately 40% to60% at a distance of 5.3 m (16.4 pile diameters). In addition to theevidence of liquefaction provided by the piezometers, a number oflarge sand boils developed around the test piles a few minutes afterthe blasting. Measured pore pressure ratios fluctuated in response to the dis- placement of the pile group. As shown in Figure 7, pore pressure ratios decreased signicantly at shallow depths near the pile groupas the lateral load increased. The magnitude of the pressure fluctu-ations decreased with depth and distance from the pile group. Atgreater distances from the pile group, the pore pressures tended toincrease rather than decrease during loading.

First, as the pile displaced lat- erally, sand and water flowed behind the piles, lling the gaps thatformed. Second, pile movement strained the soil, resulting in an ini-tial pore pressure increase, and, at large strains, a phase transforma-tion occurred with subsequent pore pressure decrease. At distancesclose to the pile, where near-eld strains were larger, this phasetransformation typically led to a decrease in R u, which corresponded to the increase in lateral load. At greater distances, strains weresmaller and generally insufficient to induce a phase transition exceptnear the ground surface. Therefore, increases in R ucorresponded to the increase in lateral load at these locations. Contours showing the distribution of the excess pore pressure ratio on a cross-section through the two foundations are shown in Figure 8 and provide further insight regarding pore pressureresponse during loading. Figure 8 ashows contours at the maximum load and deflection as the two foundations are pushed apart. At thispoint, the R uvalues in the immediate vicinity of the foundations decrease, particularly at the surface. However, at points in front ofthe foundations, the excess pore pressure increased. By contrast,Figure 8b shows contours when the foundations have been pulled back to their original starting point, which required a tensile forcebecause sand had flowed behind the pile during loading. At this point,the R uvalues increase near the surface around the test foundations, but decrease at a distance away from the piles. Blast Liquefaction Testing of Drilled Shaft at Cooper River Bridge Blast liquefaction testing also was performed in 2001 at a test site near the proposed Cooper River Bridge between Mt. Pleasant andCharleston, South Carolina. Liquefaction was expected to develop216 Transportation Research Record 1936 to a depth of 12 m in saturated loose silty sand around the founda-tion during a repeat of the M7.3 1886 Charleston earthquake ( 9). Liquefaction to this depth could signicantly reduce the lateral resis-tance of the drilled shaft foundations for the bridge. Therefore, full-scale testing was undertaken to evaluate lateral resistance of thebridge foundations after liquefaction. The layout of the test foundation, blast holes, and pore pressure transducers is shown in Figure 9. The test foundation consisted ofa 2.6-m-diameter drilled shaft, 30.5 m long, which extendedthrough the liquefied sand and into a plastic clay known asCooper Marl below a depth of 12 m ( 3). A series of three lateral load pulses were produced using the statnamic loading systemmounted on a sled. This sled produced lateral forces up to 2,300kN with a duration of approximately 0.3 s. Before each statnamictest, 1- to 2-kg explosive charges located at three to four depthsin each of eight blast holes were detonated to produce a liquefiedtest volume. The eight blast holes were equally spaced around oneof the rings surrounding the test shaft, as shown in Figure 9.Charges in adjacent blast holes were detonated simultaneouslyfrom the bottom upward with delays of approximately 200 msbetween explosions. Vertical arrays of piezoresistive and electri-cal resistance pore pressure transducers were installed at radii of1.83, 7.32, and 10.36 m from the center of the test shaft at depths,as shown in Figure 9. These transducer arrays were designed todefine the extent of the liquefied zone and to evaluate the varia-tion of the pore pressure as the statnamic lateral load was appliedto the shaft. On the basis of previous test blast experience at the site, elec- trical resistance piezometers were used only at relatively largedistances from the explosive charges because of very high failurerates.

The performance piezoresistive transducer was superior to that of the vibrating wire and resistance type strain-gauge piezometers. 2. The piezoresistive piezometer could repeatedly survive a tran- sient blast pressure of up to 41.4 MPa, yet record with a resolutionof 690 Pa. 3. Installation and extraction procedures that allowed the piezom- eters to be reused at other sites, thereby reducing the cost ofinstrumentation for blast liquefaction testing, were developed. 4. Monitoring of pore pressure response using an array of piezo- resistive piezometers made it possible to conrm the developmentof liquefaction surrounding test foundations and to evaluate the porepressure response during cyclic loading.

Gray Mullins Introduction The importance of accurately determining the load-bearing capacity of a foundation system cannot be overstated. Structures are designed for certain limit state conditions that, when exceeded, could result in catastrophic failure. To ensure such tailure does not occur, both the anticipated loading of the structure and the foundation's available resistance to this load must be determined.Several full-scale load test methods have been devised to establish the load-carrying capacity of a foundation. Generally, these test methods can be grouped into three categories: static. rapid. and dynamic. Static load tests such as those outlined by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) specifications DI 143 and Dl 194 are considered by industry as highly reliable since they most closely recreate the load duration consistent with the intended use of the foundation.I In such tests, the foundation is slowly loaded until it demonstrates sufficient capacity or until it displaces excessively. Rapid load tests such as statnamic testing, discussed in the 2000 ASTM submission, are becoming more popular because of the economic advantages of their usage.2The time required to complete a test, the amount of necessary equipment, and the manpower needed to perform these tests all are substantially less than those required to execute comparable static load tests. Although dynamic effects are introduced due to the rapid rate of loading, the mechanism by which the soil develops capacity is essentially the same as static tests. Thereby, the pile com- presses elastically and distributes load to the bearing strata proportional to the displacement and the associated capacity from that soil layer. Regardless, dynamic effects are introduced that must be quantified and removed from the mea- sured data in order to obtain an equivalent static system response profile. Dynamic tests such as those specified by ASTM D4945 are conducted during pile driving and therefore utilize the least amount of extra equipment and manpower.3 As this mechanism of loading (installation) differs drastically from the intended structural loads, the analysis for each of the installation blows is necessarily complex. Stress wave considerations become paramount in these tests and serve to complicate the data analysis process. Signal matching is the 18 Journal of Engineering Technology * Fall 2004 344preferred technique used to derive static capacity from this type of data, and the engineer's experience becomes a con- trolling factor in the validity of the results. Valid results demand extreme care during every stage of the data reduction process, and reproducibility can only manifest itself in scientifically correct, unbiased data inter- pretation. For statnamic testing, this is addressed by the development of several computer software tools. The focus of this paper is on one such software package developed by the University of South Florida (USF) for the purpose of reducing axial statnamic test data. The Statnamic Analysis Workbook (SAW) is a custom-written, highly automated Microsoft Excel workbook developed as part of a project spon- sored by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The goal was to remove user subjectivity from the data reduction process and develop a program that could deliver unbiased, reproducible results. Statnamic Background Developed by Berminghammer Foundation Equipment, the statnamic load test is founded upon the principles of Newton's second and third laws of motion. Newton's second law states that \"the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass.\"4Newton's third law states \"if two bodies interact, the force exerted on body 1 by body 2 is equal to and opposite the force exerted on body 2 by body 1.\"4 Whereas dead-weight (Kentledge) static load testing requires the use of large masses whose total force is proportional to the acceleration due to gravity, statnamic load testing uses much smaller reaction masses that are subjected to as much as twenty times the acceleration due to gravity (20 gs). By utilizing the inertial force associated with this accelerated mass, large capacity load tests are possible with comparatively small equipment. A detailed description of the test procedure can be found elsewhere.5'6'7 When first introduced in the late 1980s, statnamic testing was performed while monitoring only the applied load and resulting displacement at the top of the foundation. It is commonplace now to also monitor top-of-pile acceleration as well as toe acceleration and strain at various elevations along the pile. This additional information can be used to further describe the reaction of the soil-pile system to the applied statnamic load.6'8However, as this paper will show, it is possible to obtain very precise and reproducible system response using only top-of-pile information, provided the pile is not extraordinarily long (<1 00 feet for concrete piles).6'9 The statnamic test is a subset of rapid load tests as described by the 2000 ASTM submission.2The implication of this loading classification is that the load duration is long enough that it does not introduce stress waves. Secondly, the pile can be analyzed essentially as a rigid body. As this classification encompasses loadings that may induce accel- eration and velocity of the rigid body. any analysis must address the associated resistance to movement. Figure 1 shows the types of error that can accumulate in the data when these forces are not properly quantified and removed. The left-most curve represents the static load displacement response. Proceeding to the right, increaseddynamic effects tend to cause an overestimation of elastic stiffness and ultimate capacity. Additionally, long-term foundation response to any loading is soil-dependent and may not be reflected by some load tests (static, rapid, or dynamic). In such instances the analysis of foundations may incorpo- rate a rate effect factor to mitigate these discrepancies.

The velocity of the moving pile can therefore be determined by either integration of the acceleration-time data or differentiation of the displacement-time data. Both methods should be incorporated for verification of data quality. Knowing the acceleration, velocity, and displacement of the pile during the test event, there is sufficient information to describe the forces acting on the pile using the general equation of motion. This section provides an explanation of the mod- eling and numerical analysis process. A single degree-of-freedom dynamic system can be rep- resented with the Kelvin-Voigt constitutive model shown in Figure 2.10 Here, the mass represents the mass of the pile that is supported by soil having both static (spring) and viscous (dashpot) resistance components. Excitation of this system is obtained by providing a statnamic load pulse to the top of the pile. The reaction forces that develop in response to this excitation include the acceleration-dependent inertial force of the pile (ma). the velocity-dependent viscous resistance of the soil (cv), and the displacement-dependent static resistance of the soil (kx). At equilibrium, a summation of vertical forces leads to (1) Fstn(t) = ma(t) + civ(t) + kx(t), where t = time Fstn(t) = applied statnamic force kx(t) = static resistance cv(t) = damping resistance of the soil ma(t) = inertial force .

Constitutive model used in data regression= time at which maximum displacement occurs = applied statnamic force = inertial force = static resistance at point of maximum displacement. To successfully obtain the static resistance of the pile from a statnamic excitation, equation 1 must be solved for the quantity kx(t). Reviewing each of the terms reveals there are two unknowns in this equation: the spring coefficient k and the damping coefficient c. The system is underspecified and does not possess a closed-form solution. Middendorp's Unloading Point Method (UPM) is a numerical procedure developed specifically to solve for the damping coefficient.5Several assumptions must be made to apply the UPM. First, it is assumed that the pile behaves as a rigid body, that is, there is no appreciable elastic compression as load is applied. Secondly, once the pile fails, it does so by plunging at a constant static capacity. Finally. the damping coefficient does not change during the test.5The validity of these assumptions varies from system to system; however, in noncohesive soils and with piles below the aforementioned critical length, there is good agreement between UPM-based results and those measured during static testing.1I Middendorp defines a time window in the statnamic load-displacement data as beginning at the point of max- imum force (tl) and ending at the point of maximum displacement (t2). These points are shown as points 1 and 2 in figure 3. E0 Figure 3. Region in which static capacity is assumed constant Within this region the static force is assumed constant. This assumption is based on the shear characteristics of a plunging pile and agrees well with actual static load- displacement behavior. Since the velocity becomes zero atHaving now solved for the static resistance at this particular time, and assuming that this force remains constant between t, and t2, the damping coefficient can be calculated for every point in this region as Fstn(t) -ma(t) -kx2 c - v (t) (3) Finally, the median value of all calculated c terms is computed, and this value is used for the entire test. Having now determined this median value, equation 1 can be solved for the static resistance at each time t during the test with F,.,,,. = kx(t) = Fs,0(t) -cmedianV(t) -ma(t) . (4) The Statnamic Analysis Workhook The process of completing just one UPM on a typical statnamic data set can be arduous at best. Because the test event is so small, usually 120 ms to 250 ms, high sampling rates are used to collect the data. This process results in thousands of lines of recorded data for each test, further complicating the issue of determining the static capacity of the system. To address this concern, USF personnel in conjunction with the FHWA developed SAW, a sophisticated data analysis package based on a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)-enhanced Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Now in its fourth revision, SAW is a powerful tool that allows for the quick, unbiased determination of the static capacity of a foundation given its statnamic response information. The following sections of this paper explain the development and use of SAW on typical statnamic data. Data Import At the root of any data analysis application is the data itself, Issues such as the type of data file, the number of records within the file, and the arrangement of those records all must be addressed. Statnamic data files typically are tab- delimited, ASCII text files, regardless of the data acquisition system used to record them. However, the arrangement and content of these files varies greatly for different acquisition systems. As a result, analysis programs must be able to dis- tinguish various data file formats and properly import the data from each. Because the final data file format is highly 20 Journal of Engineering Technology * Fall 2004(3) 346dependent on the input given during a test, it becomes impossible to provide for every possible arrangement. Therefore, additional functionality must be included in the analysis program to allow data from unknown file formats to be imported. To meet this demand, SAW is equipped with a strong parsing algorithm that is comprised of a collection of several independent VBA modules. The first is a control module that prompts the user for the name of the data file to be imported, and then transfers this information to the parsing module. The parsing module opens the file, reads a specified section of it, and then transfers the contents of this section to the data type library. The data type library contains entries that are compared to the data that was read in with the pars- ing module. Once a match is found, a flag is set and then used by the importer module to determine where individual records are located within the data file. If the data is stored in an unrecognized format, another module allows this data to be manually imported. The user simply highlights the data that will be read into SAW and selects a command button to complete the import process, as shown in figure 4. Figure 4. Primary user interface in SAW Once the data being imported has been identified, either automatically or manually, the import process commences in two stages. First, the number of records in the data file is determined. Because most of the workbook is generated dynamically depending upon the length of the data file, SAW is equipped with code that allows it to precisely determine the number of records contained in the file, using low-level file manipulation commands embedded in a Do- Until loop. The function of this looped code is to essentially count the number of lines of data in the file. After each line is counted, an integer variable is incremented by one. Once the loop finishes, the value of the integer variable corre- sponds to the number of lines of data in the file.Having determined the quantity of data being imported, the second stage of the import process is to actually import the data and write the associated worksheet formulas for zero-correction, units conversion, numerical integration, and numerical differentiation. At this time a number of key values are also determined. The maximum value of applied load is identified and its location within the workbook is specified. The algebraic signs of the imported data are also determined, an important feature because the use of an inconsistent sign convention will lead to erroneous calcu- lations. The algebraic sign of each measured parameter depends upon the instrumentation and acquisition system used. It is standard practice in the study of physics to assign a negative sign to acceleration vectors that are directed toward the center of the earth, and also the standard chosen for data imported into SAW. All values of load and dis- placement that are directed into the foundation are assigned a negative sign. Similarly, acceleration is assigned an algebraic sign such that when it is integrated twice with respect to time, the resulting displacement is in the same direction as that value measured during the test. 66 Rapid load tests such as statnamic testing, discussed in the 2000 ASTM submission, are becoming more popular because of the economic advantages of their usage. 99 After the data is imported and the sign convention is verified, the data must be zero-corrected. It is known that there is no initial relative acceleration, velocity, or displace- ment present in the system. However, the recorded data will not start at zero because the transducers typically measure absolute, not relative, quantities. The origin of the data is therefore adjusted automatically by the VBA code. Adapting to Faulty Data Sometimes there is a problem with one of the transducers that causes it to transmit faulty data. For example, during a statnamic test it is possible to move the foundation beyond the range of the displacement transducer, which is about 50 mm. This condition introduces useless data into the record set. Since the spreadsheet normally includes the laser dis- placement in calculations and graphs, this erroneous data produces meaningless results. This displacement error is just one example of a problem that can occur in the field. Because all transducers are sensitive electronic devices, any one of them is subject to failure. SAW is written in a manner that exploits the redundancy in the instrumentation. In addition to numerically integrat- ing accelerometer recordings to obtain velocity and then displacement, the laser displacement is differentiated with respect to time as well. Velocity and acceleration are calcu- Journal of Engineering Technology 0 Fall 2004 21Statnamnic Analysis WVorbokbok Written kg Pistonlass O3ig k S=Ms: . 0 kg othMas- ! kioatlh\u0001w.f ' 347lated again. If either the accelerometer or the displacement transducer fails during a test, the necessary data can be obtained from the remaining transducer. Additionally, it is useful to compare the displacement traces from both the accelerometer and the laser to ensure that they match reasonably well. Results show that the use of the twice- integrated accelerometer data can compensate for noise found in the laser data. As shown in figure 5, SAW offers a customized user form that lets the user select the source of all data for calculations and graphs. * 1:*::. II \"ewbkW ! 0 D. -S -0 ,, ,,_1 \\_:D,__ __ _ Figure 5. Data Options tool for choosing source data The custom user form shown in figure 6 allows the user to truncate data as needed. Because both pre- and post- event readings are taken during a statnamic test, it is often desirable to eliminate excess readings from the end of a test to make the results more presentable. One immediate con- sequence of doing so is that the last recorded load value is lost, thereby nullifying any previous attempt at zero- correcting the load data. In response, the final recorded load value is permanently stored in SAW when the data is first imported. With the custom user form, the analyst then specifies the last desired time value for the test data and the program automatically truncates the file to that point. This process does not affect the zero-correction of the load data and does not change the original data file in any manner. .8) Unloading Point calculations ar[e complete.

Data Trim tool for removing postevent data Data Manipulation There are a number of standard calculations that are always performed for each data set imported into SAW, as shown in figure 7. Acceleration is integrated with respect to time to obtain velocity, and then again to obtain displacement. Laser data is differentiated with respect to time to obtain velocity, and then again to obtain acceleration. UPM calculations are performed, in many cases repeatedly for each data set.I} I AI' _L 7 3 r oiUled lli-.. 1.1nIXA 11. screen showing standard calcu- lations and additional controls Perhaps the greatest advantage offered by SAW is that the time required to complete a UPM analysis of the data is reduced to just a few seconds. All of the steps involved in the UPM analysis are fully automated with VBA code, and the results are presented immediately as shown in figure 8. Changes can be made and a new UPM analysis can be per- formed quickly and easily. This time savings is particularly helpful when reducing data from several cycles of load tests carried out on multiple foundations. 0.000 -0.010 (kN) Figure 8. Results screen showing applied load, inertia- corrected load, and static capacity The flexibility offered by the spreadsheet environment is unparalleled. Not only can standard UPM calculations be performed, but any other desired calculation, manipulation, or presentation of the data can be completed quickly and easily using the spreadsheet's vast resources. Multiple test cycles can be superimposed to create a composite found- ation response curve. Static load test data can be inserted and compared directly to the statnamic-derived static response. Even changes in the UPM algorithm can be quickly incorporated by simply altering cell formulas. Statistics Database Revision 4 of SAW includes several new and useful tools for collecting key statnamic statistics for each processed data set. As stated earlier, the UPM gives a very good initial 22 Journal of Engineering Technology @ Fall 2004* t F t! F e F 7 e 7 7 348estimate of the one key parameter necessary for completing the dynamic force equation: the damping coefficient. Engi- neering judgement is then employed to adjust this value until a reasonable load-displacement response curve is obtained. Because the damping coefficient is contingent on many variables, it is desirable to keep a database of all values en- countered during different statnamic tests. SAW includes a Damping Coefficient Statistics tool that stores the mean, median, and standard deviation of the damping coefficient c for each test, as shown in figure 9. This information can then be used to develop correlations between the statnamic damping coefficient and parameters such as soil type, load pulse duration, load magnitude, and strain rate. These correlations ultimately could provide engineers with reasonable starting values for new tests. Although not discussed in this paper, correlations between statnamic-determined damping coefficients, unit skin friction, and soil type are being developed.12I ::i : :L :al 5EPen: : .n l n .n a 5 , 3 5 7 l _- , ---( i .2 Z ..E \\ t.0 ,40 : -N 0.11 0.170 Ta(-ee Figure Damping Coefficient Statistics tool Figure 10 shows SAW's Load-Displacement Statistics tool, which compiles all load-displacement characteristics such as the maximum statnamic force, magnitude of preload, maximum static force, and displacement information such as maximum displacement, displacement at maximum static force, and permanent set of the pile. These values are then displayed along with the response curves for the applied load, inertia-corrected load, and static capacity as a function of displacement. As with the Damping Coefficient Statistics tool, both the data and the graph can be exported separately for future use. Data Export The primary goal of the data export module was to interface with the FHWA's Deep Foundations Database. Currently, this database contains tables into which statnamic data can be uploaded. Before SAW, the only way to enter statnamic data into these tables was to manually input each recorded value of time, displacement, velocity, acceleration, applied load, and derived static resistance for each load test. There is no mystery as to why there is very little statnamic data in the FHWA database.Figure 10. Load-Displacement Statistics tool Recognizing the need for a better method of integrating statnamic data into the database, USF personnel worked closely with SAWs program designers, Technology & Management Applications, Inc. (TMA) of Maryland. TMA created an automated statnamic Data Import module for the Deep Foundations Database, shown in figure 11, and a corresponding data export module for SAW, shown in figure 12. This export module automatically generates a data file containing all of the reduced values for a statnamic test, formatted so that it is recognized by the Data Import module for loading into the Deep Foundations Database. A typical test containing 1500 lines of reduced data now can be up- loaded to the FHWA database in a matter of seconds. tUs- d,aa i n n i d51ia -005 -01 -OltS -755IRE Figure 11. Data Import module for importing format- ted data to the FHWA database A secondary feature of the data exporter is that it can be used to create files containing only reduced data. These files are much smaller in size than a full spreadsheet file, so archiving data from many tests is more efficient. If test results are needed at a later date, the reduced data file can be opened by any spreadsheet program and the charts can be recreated as needed. Journal of Engineering Technology @ Fall 2004 23 349Figure 12. Data Export module for exporting formatted data from SAW Summary Since its introduction in the early 1980s, statnamic testing has become more widespread as a suitable alternative to large-scale static load tests. Utilizing a rapid load pulse and accelerations of as much as 20 gs, the method can be used to measure the static response of a pile to a given load, provided the inertial and viscous forces introduced during testing are quantified and removed from the final data. Although several methods of analyzing this type of data presently exist, the UPM was selected for this application.5 The large volume of data collected during a typical statnamic test together with the extensive calculations necessary to fully reduce a single data set begs the use of computer-based analysis. To this end, USF personnel have developed SAW, a Visual Basic-enhanced spreadsheet program that automates much of the data reduction task. Additionally, this software interfaces with the FHWA's Deep Foundation Database and allows for the upload and storage of key load test data in the database. SAW is freely available via the Internet to educational institutions, engi- neering consultants, or other organizations requiring this type of statnamic data analysis.13 Acknowledgments The authors would like to express their gratitude to the Federal Highway Administration for funding this project,as well as to Berminghammer Foundation Equipment, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and the Florida Department of Transportation for their technical advice.

Associate Professor, University of South Florida, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Tampa, Florida, USA Mike Muchard, P.E. Principal Geotechnical Engineer, Applied Foundation Testing, Inc., Green Cove Springs, Florida, USA Bud Khouri, P.E. Vice President, Trevi Icos South Corporation, Clearwater, Florida, USA Abstract: A post grouted drilled shaft foundation system was successfully used in place of the specified driven pile foundation system as a Value Engineering Cost Proposal (VECP) for the new PGA Boulevard Grade Separation Project. Pressure grouting the cohesionless sandy soils at the drilled shaft base significantly increased the end bearing capacity and stiffness allowing drilled shafts to be the more cost effective foundation system. The post grouted drilled shaft option also provided other benefits including reducing owners risk normally associated with pile driving vibrations and offered a high level of quality assurance for the drilled shafts. This paper discusses the implementation of post grouted drilled shafts from design to completion of construction. A design procedure for post grouted drilled shafts developed by the University of South Florida was used for initial VECP evaluation. Prior to construction, two instrumented test shafts were installed and load tested, one of which was post grouted. Therein, the design procedure was calibrated, tip elevations for production shafts were refined, drilled shaft construction and grouting procedures were demonstrated, and a grouting criteria was developed for the project. Introduction Although technically feasible, drilled shafts are not typically thought of being cost effective in sandy soils. This is mainly because little to no end bearing can be relied upon within service displacement limits. Additional skepticism on the use of end bearing in sand can be attributed to soil disturbance at the shaft base during construction and the ability to effectively clean out the excavation. End bearing capacity in sand can be significant but large displacements are required to fully benefit from its use. By post construction pressure grouting below the shaft tip,the base resistance can be mobilized thereby elimina ting these problematic issues. In many cases, the available base resistance improvement is bounded only by the skin friction resistance to upward shaft movement. Post grouting of drilled shafts has been successfully used on many projects in Europe and Asia to precompress soft debris or loose soil relaxed by excavation (Bolognesi and Moretto, 1973; Stoker, 1983; Bruce, 1986; Fleming, 1993; Mullins et. al, 2000). Its use in the USA, while it is only recent, is gaining wide acceptance due in part to a rational design method developed 367by the University of South Florida and its heightened quality assurance aspects. This paper only provides a brief description of this design method and is included only to assist in the understanding of a case history where post grouted drilled shafts were used on a major Florida Department of Transportation bridge project. A more detailed description of the design procedure can be found elsewhere (Mullins et. al, 2001). The main focus is on the construction and load testing of the post grouted drilled shafts. Project Information The PGA Boulevard Grade Separation Project was located in West Palm Beach, Florida and consisted of improvements to its intersection of Alt A1A. In all, the project had three bridge structures including PGA Boulevard Alt A1A, A1A SW Ramp to I-95 and Alt A1A SW Ramp over FEC Railway. The project was funded by the Florida Departme nt of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration. Astaldi Construction Corporation was the General Contractor and TreviIcos South, Inc. the drilled shaft contractor. Inspection was performed by Delta Consulting Engineers, Inc. on behalf of the FDOT. Applied Foundation Testing, Inc. provided instrumentation, Statnamic load testing and performed the pressure grouting services on the project. The structures foundations were originally designed using a LRFD design approach on 24\" square prestressed concrete piles arranged in bents and groups. Factored design loads were 135 to 220 tons with a resistance factor of 0.65. Pile lengths were up to 70 feet. Because nearby structures were sensitive to vibration, pile driving hours were heavily restricted and confine d to a four hour work window at night. To circumvent these problems, drilled shafts were considered as a Value Engineering Cost Proposal (VECP). Pressure grouting of the drilled shaft tips was used to increase their capacity allowing the drilled shaft option to be more economical. Other benefits included reducing the project schedule due to increased work hours, reduction of pier cap size, reducing risks associated with vibrations, and increased drilled shaft quality assurance. A total of 108 drilled shafts replaced 234 24 inch driven piles. The shafts design diameter was 36 inche s (nominal) with lengths of 30 to 50 feet. Factored design loads ranged from 195 to 490 tons. A resistance factor of 0.75 was used due to the added quality assurance from load testing. Although not considered at the design phase, additional confidence could have been incorporated in the form of an increased resistance factor due to post grouting every shaft. To verify design and demonstrate the construction method, a load test program was undertaken. Two test shafts, designated as LT-1 and LT-2, were constructed with nearly identical geometr ic properties and subsurface conditions except LT-2 was equipped with a post grout apparatus at the tip. Each shaft was also instrumented with 3 levels of embedded strain gages. LT-2 also included telltales at three different levels. The test program involved first performing a grouting test of LT-2 then performing downward axial compression Statnamic load tests on each shaft. The instrumentation was monitored during pressure grouting and load testing. Based on the grouting and load test results shaft tip elevations were refined and a grouting criteria was developed for the project. 368Soil Conditions A soil boring was drilled at each test shaft location. The as-built location of Test Shaft LT-1 corresponded to Boring B-1. Boring PGAB-1 coincided with the Test Shaft LT-2 location. Test shaft schematic drawings and soil profiles are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The soil profile generally consisted of very loose to dense Sand (SP) with intermittent layers of shelly Sand for the entire depth of the borings. Generally, the upper 30 feet were very loose to medium dense (N= 2 to 20) and the lower 50 feet were medium dense to very dense sands (N= 9 to 41). Large amounts of rainfall following several years of near drought conditions in Florida produced unusually large fluctuations in groundwater levels between 3 to 10 feet in depth during the course of the project.

The technology was effectively transferred to design and construction where post-grouted drilled shafts have been implemented on several DOT projects in Florida, Mississippi and Texas and is planned for several more upcoming projects. Full details of this study can be found elsewhere (Mullins, et al., 2001). The design approach for post grouted drilled shaft tips makes use of common parameters used for a convent ional (un-grouted) drilled shaft design. This methodology includes the following seven steps: 1) Determine the ungrouted end bearing capacity in units of stress.2) Determine the permissible displacement as a percentage of shaft diameter (e.g.1\"/48\"*100% .2%). 3) Evaluate the ultimate side shear resistance for the desired shaft length and diameter (in units of force). 4) Establish a maximum grout pressure that can be resisted by the side shear (ultimate side shear divided by the tip cross sectional area). 5) Calculate the Grout Pressure Index, GPI, defined as the ratio of grout pressure to the ungrouted end bearing capacity (Step 3 / Step 1). 6) Using design curves from Figure 3 , determine the Tip Capacity Multiplier, TCM, using the GPI calcu lated in Step 5. 7) Calculate the grouted end bearing capacity by multiplying the TCM with the ungrouted end bearing (TCM * Step 1). Figure 3. Design curve for shaft tips in sand (Mullins et al., 2001). 370The ungrouted capacity (GPI = 0) is represented by these curves at the y-intercept where TCM = 1 for a 5% displacement (no improvement). The 1% and 2% intercepts reduce the end bearing according to the normal behavior of partially mobilized end bearing. Interestingly, the grouted end bearing capacity is strongly dependent on available side shear capacity (grout pressure) as well as the permissible displacement. However, it is relatively independent of the ungrouted end bearing capacity when in sandy soils. As such, the end bearing in loose sand deposits can be greatly improved in both stiffness and ultimate capacity given sufficient side shear against which to devel op grout pressure. An example of the ungrouted and grouted capacity analysis as described above is shown in Figure 4 . In dense sands and clays significant improvement in stiffness can be realized with more modest effects on ultimate capacity. -60-50-40-30-20-1001020 0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 Capacity (tons)Elevation (ft) -60-50-40-30-20-10010200 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800Grout Pressure (psi)Elevation (ft)PGA Blvd Ungrouted Capacity @ 1.80 in Disp Grouted Capacity @ 1.80 in Disp Grout Pressure 3 ft Diameter, Boring PGAB-1 Figure 4.

An oversized diameter temporary casing was installed to a depth of 13 feet to stabilize the upper soils. This casing which was removed immediately after pouring concrete had an outer diameter of 42 inches and a \u00bd inch wall thickness. The remaining shaft excavation was drilled under a bentonite slurry with a 34 inch diameter drilling tool. The total length of LT-1 was 60.8 feet including 1 foot formed and poured above ground. Shaft schematic drawings for both test shafts are shown in Figures 1 and 2 . Shaft LT-2 was an out of position non- production shaft constructed nearly identical to LT-1 but had a Flat Jack type post grout apparatus installe d in the tip. Because an oversized diameter upper temporary casing was used, the upper 13 feet of the shaft had a section diameter of 42 inches. The remaining shaft below the temporary casing depth had a diameter of 34 inches. The total length of LT-2 was 60.5 feet including 1 foot formed and poured aboveground. Figure 5 shows the instrumented test shafts. Figure 6 shows the drill rig used for shaft installation. Post Grouting of Test Shaft During the base grouting, the bi- directionally acting grout pressure is resisted by the skin friction of the shaft. Thus, the available end bearing improvement is bounded by the shaft friction. Inherently, the grouting process then provides quantifiable data on the skin friction and a lower limit of end bearing capacity of each shaft. A flat jack type grout delivery system was fastened to the bottom of the rebar cage prior to placing it in the excavation. A flat-jack consists of a steel plate wrapped in a rubber membrane thus providing a debonded pressurizing surface beneath the shaft tip (shown in Figure 7 ). Post grouting was performed with a high pressure high efficiency mixing grout plant as shown in Figure 8 . The plant included a colloidal mixing tank and an agitated holding tank. The pump was a single stage hydraulic actuated piston type capable of 1500 psi grouting pressure. The grout was Type I/II Portland cement with a water/cement ratio of 0.50. Figure 6. Test Shaft Installation. 372 Figure 8. Three part grout plant.For the grouting of the test shaft, a reference beam was set up over the shaft. Note that a reference beam was not used on any of the production shafts but rather a survey level. LVDTs and string potentiometers were mountedon the reference beam to measure the shaft top upward displacement and the upward displacement from the telltales. An electronic pressure transducer was used to measure grout pressure. The embedded strain gages directly above the shaft tip were used to calibrate the grout pressure to load applied at the shaft base. The upper levels of strain gages provided the side shear distribution. A data acquisition system was used to monitor all instrumentation with a measurement frequency of 1 sample every second. The grouting demonstration set up is shown in Figure 9 . Manual measurements were also made during grouting including shaft top upward displacement with a survey level, grout pressure from a dial gage at the pump and grout volume placed. These three measurements were made on each production shaft. The general procedure consisted of first flushing the grout lines with fresh water until clear water return was observed. Grouting began with the lines open. When grout return was observed, the return line valves were closed and pressurization started. The grout was injected at low flow rates and stopped periodically for various measurements. Figure 7. Flat jack grout plate. Figure 9. Monitoring test shaft during grouting. 373Load Test Program Axial load tests were conducted using a Statnamic device, shown in Figure 10 . This device is capable of applying downward load to the top of the shaft of up to 2000 tons. A mechan ical catching mechanism allows efficient test set up. Instrumentation included sister-bar mounted strain gages at the elevations shown on Figures 1 and 2. The strain gages are included to provide determination of base and side shear resistance. The sister bars included full bridge resistance type strain gages. The full bridge (four active gages) provides stable strain measurements to a precision of less than \u00bd microstrain and inherent temperature compensation. The resistance gagesallow high frequency data logging during the rapid load testing. As is typical with the Statnamic load test setup, load was measured with a calibrated load cell and displacement was measured with a photo-voltaic sensor trigge red by a stationary laser reference. Three capacitive type accelerometers provide redundant measurement of displacement and also measure any eccentricity at the shaft head. A high speed data acquisition system was used to monitor all instrumentation with a measurement frequency of 5000 samples per second. Traditional survey was perform ed before and after each test to provide a check on permanent displacements. The derive d static capacity from the Statnamic tests was performed using the Segmental Unloading Point Method (SUP) developed at the University of South Florida (Mullins, et. al., 2002). The SUP method, discretizes a foundatio n into segments. The number of segments and their lengths are defined by the locations of the embedded strain g ages. This allows the standard Unloading Point Method (UPM) to be applied to each segment. Then the total derived static response is calculated as the sum of the derived static response from the individual segments. Test Results During the grouting demonstration, a total volume of 6.2 cubic feet of grout was placed. The maximum upward shaft displacement was 0.687 inches. Figure 11 shows the grout pressure measured at the pump and the concrete stress measured at the strain g ages (based on a calculate d concrete modulus of elasticity). The pressure spikes of the single stage grout pump are not as evident in the strain gage readings. This type of figure provides a relationship between Figure 10. 2000 ton Statnamic load test. 374grout pressure measured at the pump and that pressure (stress) achieved at the shaft tip. Good correlation was observed during continuous grouting. However, the divergence shown is due to grout setting up in the lines during prolonged waiting periods indicated by the three unloads. Side shear stiffness is not typically thought to significantly improve through reloading as it did in this case. This information was then used to establish the Production Grouting Criteria (discussed later). The grout volume is superimposed in Figure 12 . In Figure 13 the upward load distribution from the strain measurements are depicted in terms of upward shaft top displacement. This figure shows a mobilized upward skin friction capacity of 336 tons at the termination of grouti ng. In turn, resisted by a minimum of 336 tons of end bearing. After the shaft was displaced upward during the grouting process, a downward Stanamic test was performed. The maximum static capacity for the grouted shaft, as shown in Figure 14 , was 1,170 tons at a top deflection of 1.80 inches. The maximum capacity of the ungrouted shaft was 878 tons at 1.63 inches of displacement. Figure 15 shows the end bearing curves calculated from the strain measurements for the ungrouted and grouted shafts. The grouted shaft showed 484 tons of end bearing at 5% diameter displacement, whereas the ungrouted showed133 tons. Figure 16 shows the skin friction capacity from the strain measurements for the ungrouted and grouted shafts. The maximum friction capacity of the grouted shaft was 720 tons at a displacement of 1.50 inches. In the early part of this curve, the effect of stress reversal can be seen. It is estimated that 0.2 inches of downward movement was required to redevelop any shear capacity. This only mildly affected the total capacity as shown in Figure 14 up to 500 tons. The maximum side shear capacity of the ungrouted shaft was 777 tons at a displacement of 1.50 inches. 0.000.100.200.300.400.500.600.700.80 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Grout Pressure (PSI)Upward Shaft Displacement (IN)Grout Pressure Concrete Stress Figure 11 Grout pressure measured at pump and at strain gages in shaft toe. 3750.000.100.200.300.400.500.600.700.80 0 200 400 600 800 1000 Grout Pressure (PSI)Upward Shaft Displacement (IN) 01234567 Grout Volume (CF) Concrete Stress Grout Volume Figure 12.

The criteria consisted of three components. Most importantly was the grout pressure, which varied as a function of the required shaft ultimate capacity. Secondly, an upward displacement limit was set based on the T-Z response of the soil. Although not problematic for the strain hardening soils at this site, this type of limit is necessary to minimize degradation of the side shear to a lesser residual strength in more sensitive soils. Lastly, a minimum volume was set to ensure that artificial pressure was not developed due to clogged lines. Perhaps the most significant benefit of the post grouted construction method is the quality assurance that is derived. Therein, quantify- able information on the capacity of every shaft on the project was obtained. The upward displacement versus applied pressure relationship was documented for each shaft in addition to confirming a volume of grout was indeed placed beneath each shaft. Plots of upward displacement for the first 76 production shafts (Phase I of the project) are shown in Figure 18 . Interestingly, shafts that were constructed with no obvious deviations Figure 18. Post-grouted drilled shaft upward displacement summary for phase 1 of the project.from expected performed very well. This is evidenced by small upward displacements during the grouting (excellent side shear capacity). Those with somewhat higher upward displacements could be linked to some form of construction difficu lty. Nevertheless, all shafts demonstrated full capacity by developing design grout pressures within the recommended upward displacement limit. However, it is interesting to note that concrete overruns do not equate to higher capacity in spite of the obvious increase in dimension. This can be attributed to the radial disturbance (loosening) caused by excava tions that become slightly unstable and subsequently slough soil into the bored hole. Further, each shaft was constructed within State construction and inspection guidelines which obviously played into the ability of each shaft to ultimately develop the required side shear. Figure 17.

The additional benefits from heightened quality assurance are unparalleled by other methods of ascertaining shaft integrity. As such, the side shear and end bearing capacity of every shaft can be assured to a level proportional to the applied grout pressure. Although there is no present method of fully deriving the entire benefit of testing every foundation element, it is envisioned that future design codes will encompass the enormous statistical reliability of knowing every shaft's capacity. In this case, a modest resistance factor of 0.75 (present code upper value) was used as the program incorporated load testing. The outlined design method, developed by USF for FDOT, provided a good overall model for setting shaft tip elevations and predicting capacity in the shelly sand bearing strata. These predictions were additionally used to establish minimum grout pressure for each shaft that was then verified by achievable grout pressu re and inspection. The cost implications of using post grouted drilled shafts are vast. At this site, the VECP was accepted implying that the grout ed shaft option was at least as cost effective as the driven pile option. Although the number of shafts grouted and site related factors may sway bid values, the actual cost of grouting a shaft is commensurate with other quality assurance testing such as Mini- SID (shaft inspection device), CSL (cross-hole sonic logging), or sonic echo tests. However, designers can directly estimate the savings associated with post grouted shafts based on shaft length reductions; as shown in Figure 4 a 400 ton load requires an ungrouted shaft to be over 50 ft while a grouted shaft would be under 30 ft.References AASHTO, LRFD Bridge Design Specifications, Customary U.S. Units (2nd Edition), American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, Washington, D.C., 1998, w/1999 interim revisions.

This is in part due to the relatively poor end bearing performance of shafts caused by the large displacement required to mobilize the ultimate capacity . Recently, a new design method has revitalized a construction method that significantly improves the end bearing capacity of shafts in virtually all scenarios. This article will summarize the design and construction of drilled shafts using this technique. INTRODUCTION The end bearing of drilled shafts (especially in sands) has long been discounted due to a variety of reasons such as borehole cleanliness and the like. However, even in the ideal conditions of perfectly clean excavations, the end bearing in virtually all soil types is only partially available due to the large displacements required to develop that capacity. Simply stated, the side shear and end bearing components of the drilled shafts are analogous to side-by- side spring systems with vastly different characteristics. As such, the side shear is like a series of short-stroke, high stiffness shear springs where more shaft length incorporates more of these springs. The end bearing is more like a single long-stroke, low stiffness spring that can develop enormous loads, but only at very large displacements (Fig. 1). This article addresses a construction method that significantly improves the stiffness of the end bearing \"spring.\" BACKGROUND As far back as 1961, engineers around the world have targeted improving the end bearing of drilled shafts using post construction, high pressure grouting beneath the shaft tip (also called post grouting or base grouting). The first published citing was much later in 1973 by Bolognesi and Moretto. These early test programs showed that post-grouting large diameter shafts led to increased ultimate load capacity up to three times in both sands and clays. As a result, post-grouting techniques have become a routine construction process in many parts of the world. However, the notable absence of the prac tice in the United States has been attributed to no recognized design approach. Post grouting drilled shafts targets the mechanisms intrinsic to drilled shaft construction that m ake the end bearing only minimally usable. These mechanisms include: (1) soil relaxation beneath the shaft tip due to excavation, (2) debris remaining after clean out, and (3) strain incompatibility between the side shear and end bearing (mobilizing displacement mismatch). By precompressing the soil after construction, it is clear how the first two mechanisms can be mitigated. However, the third is better understood via illustration. Fig.1 shows four states of a drilled shaft from the perspective of the displacement required to distribute load. It includes: (a) the post construction state where no load is applied, (b) the fully loaded state of a conventional, ungrouted shaft, (c) the conditions just after post grouting, and (d) the loaded state of a grouted shaft. The conventional, ungrouted shaft (b) shows little end bearing contribution based on the displacement required to obtain ultimate capacity. In this case, the ultimate side shear displacement and/or the permissible service limits are exceeded far before the end bearing can contribute. Consequently, little to no end bearing is typically considered for design. Fig. 1(c) shows two significant features: (1) the end bearing strata can be pre compressed to access more of the ultimate capacity, and (2) the upward movement of the shaft during grouting may lock in negative skin friction that when loaded will increase the permissible downward movement (up to 2% diam.) without exceeding the ultimate side shear displacement. This helps to transfer load to the toe while balancing the displacement at ultimate side shear and end bearing. However, from a \"nuts and bolts\" perspective, the upward movement should be monitored and limited based on a pilot grouting program at the beginning of construction. Interestingly, Fig. 1(d) depicts the full structural load applied to the foundation while mobilizing significant end bearing and minimizing overall displacement. By engaging a large fraction of the ultimate end bearing, shafts can either be shortened for a given load or can provide higher capacity for a given length. 382012345678910 0123456 GPI (grout pressure / q ungrouted )TCM ungrouted )5% Diameter 2% on 48\") based on qungrouted being mobilized at a 5% diameter displacement (e.g. Reese and Wright, 1977 or Reese and O'Neill, 1988).Ultimate end bearing disp.

At the conclusion of the first phase of research (in 2001), a viable design and construction procedure was made available to consultants that incorporated these findings. Within the two short years that followed, four bridge projects using post grouted shafts have been undertaken with over twenty general contractors having given it serious consideration. A brief overview of both the design and construction procedures are presented below. Design. The design of post-grouted drilled shaft tips can be easily summarized in the following seven steps: (1) Determine the ungrouted end bearing capacity in units of stress. (2) Determine the permissible displacement in units of percent shaft diameter (disp/diam*100%). (3) Evaluate the ultimate si de shear resistance for the desired shaft length in units of force. (4) Establish a maximum grout pressure that can be resisted by the side shear in units of stress ( Step 3 / Tip Area ). (5) Calculate the Grout Pressure Index, GPI, defined as the ratio of grout pressure to the ungrouted end bearing capacity ( Step 4 / Step 1 ). (6) Using design curves from Fig. 2, determine the Tip Capacity Multiplier, TCM , using the GPI calculated in Step 5 . (7) Calculate the grouted end bearing capacity (ultimate) by multiplying the TCM by the ungrouted end bearing (TCM * Step 1). Fig. 2 Correlations used in Step 6 to establish TCM (Mullins. et al., 2001) The design procedure affords the designer the ability to select the \"usable ultimate\" capacity as a function of permissible settlement (Fig. 2; larger displacement yields higher TCM ). Therein, unless using very small diameter shafts (or high % diameter), reserve capacity will exist should more settlement occur. Construction. The construction of grouted drilled shafts varies only slightly from conventional shafts: (1) during cage fabrication a grout distribution cell is installed at the base of cage with grout tubes that extend to the top of shaft, Fig. 3, (2) no spacer feet are required below the cell but rather the cell rests on the bottom of the excavation, and (3) after the shaft concrete has cured to sufficient strength, neat cement grout is pumped to the base of the shaft until the design pressure is achieved, Fig. 4. Fig. 3 Installation of grout distribution cell (Courtesy of Applied Foundation Testing, Inc.) 383The grout pressure can be locked in using sacrificial in-line valves, but it is not necessary. Fig. 4. Top of shaft receiving grout The first shaft grouted on site is usually used to set the grouting/construction criteria for proper shaft design and installation. Aside from verifying a designated grout pressure, a pilot program will provide criteria including the maximum permissible uplift and the minimum acceptable grout volume. These are set on the basis of field data such as that shown in Fig. 5. The maximum uplift criterion should minimize the adverse effects of over-stressing the side shear (in this case 0.1 inches). The minimum grout volume criterion is intended to assure that a reasonable volume is pumped to the base of the shaft as the design pressure is achieved. This prevents a grout line blockage from artificially satisfying the design grout pressure criterion. In the case shown in Fig. 5, a minimum of 2 cubic feet would suffice. This type of information can also be used to estimate the grout volume that the contractor may expect to use per shaft (approximately 10 CF at 0.1 inches). Quality Assurance. Post grouting drilled shafts provides a level of quality assurance that is unparalleled by other shaft integrity methodologies. The information in Fig. 5 can and should be collected for every shaft installed to provide verification of shaft performance. Therein, the side shear and end bearing resistance of the shaft are proven for every shaft up to the level of the applied grout pressure. At a minimum the shaft capacity is therefore capable of resisting 2 times the product of the grout pressure and the end bearing area. This lower limit of the shaft capacity is often more than the service loads thus providing 100% certainty of competence. CASE STUDIES OF END BEARING ENHANCEMENT Within the two years that this end bearing enhancement procedure has been available, several bridge projects have incorporated post grouting into the drilled shaft design. These include: (1) Royal Park Bridge, Palm Beach, FL; (2) PGA Blvd, West Palm Beach, FL; (3) Natchez Trace Parkway, Natchez, MS; and (4) FM507 Bridge, in Willacy County, TX. Additionally, the post grouted shafts have been tested in sands, silts, and clayey with shafts 2', 2.5', 3', 3.5', 4', and 6' in diameter.

Fig. 6 shows only a moderate difference between locking in the grout pressure and not. In clayey soils (Fig. 8) increased stiffness may be expected with more modest improvement in ultimate end bearing. CONCLUSIONS Although pressure grouting drilled shaft tips has been proven successful worldwide, its use in the U.S. has only recently evolved largely due to the availability of a new rational design approach. Case studies have confirmed the findings of the research that led to this method while also accenting the merits of a tremendous quality assurance mechanism.

Three different seal slab placement con- ditions\u2014fresh wate r, salt water, and bentonite slurry\u2014were evalu- ated and the results were compared against controls where no fluid was displaced by the concrete. Normal pile surfaces were investi- gated. Additionally, the situation of soil-caked piles was also tested. In the model tests, eight 15 cm deep, W6 x 15 sections were used for two different embedment depths of 1.5 d and 2 d, with d being the depth of the section. In the full-scale tests, 16 specimens 35 cm deep (W14 x 90 sections) were tested with the embedment varied between 0.5d and 2d. The results show that significant bond stresses developed even in the worst placement condition. Recommendations made for revising current values in specifications have already been imple mented by the Florida Department of Transportation. Keywords: bond; pile; slab; steel. INTRODUCTION Cofferdams are usually required in the construction of bridge foundations over waterways. Typically, a sheet pile enclosure is constructed in water and piles are driven as shown in Fig. 1. A tremie concrete seal is then placed. When the seal has sufficiently cured, the cofferdam is dewatered and internal bracing is installed. Thus, the seal allows the construction of the pier to be carried out under dry conditions. Because the function of the unreinforced seal slab is primarily to provide dry working conditions, its design is quite simple. The seal thickness is essentially determined so that its weight balances the maximum uplift pressure since the allowable interface shear stresses are very small. Previ ous AASHTO specifications1 permitted interface shear stress values of 69 kPa (10 psi). These values, however, were reduced to 34.5 kPa (5 psi) for steel interfaces in the Florida Design Guidelines.2 Neither values are based on test data. In 1997, the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) funded a study to evaluate interface bond from full- scale tests. This paper presents results relating to the seal slab/steel pile interface bond. A companion paper provides the corresponding results for prestressed piles.3 The com plete results from this study including finite element modeling may be found elsewhere.4,5 RESEARCH SIGNIFICANCE This study provides the first set of experimental results on the interface shear between steel piles and seal concrete slabs cast in accordance with construction specifications.6 The results obtained have already led to increased allowable interface shear in the latest specifications.7 This should result in reduced construction costs. OBJECTIVES The overall goal of the study was to recommend interface shear stress values for seal slab and piles that could be directlyused in FDOT's design specifications. These values were to be based on full-scale tests conducted on specimens that had been prepared in accordance with current FDOT specifications6 for conditi ons that were commonly encountered. Variables examined were the pile embedment depth, effect of pile surface, effect of the pile material (steel or concrete), and the type of fluid that was displaced by the concrete. EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM The load transfer characteristics in seal slabs can be simulated by conducting pullout tests, illustrated in Fig. 2, in which compressive loads are applied to the seal slab and tensile loads to the steel piles. Careful attention had to be paid to the experimental setup so that tests could be carried out under field conditions. Small-scale bond tests were conducted to identify the maximum pullout lengths for a 1/3 scale pilot study. Results of the pilot study were used to subsequently refine the apparatus and procedures for the full-scale testing. PILOT STUDY The pilot study simulated three different seal slab placement conditions involving: 1) salt water; 2) fresh water; and 3) drilling fluid. These results were compared against controls where no fluid had to be displaced by the concrete. The 15 cm- deep, wide flange sections were tested for two different embedment depths, 1.5 d and 2 d (d is the nominal pile size). A total of eight model scale tests were conducted (four conditions and two embedment depths). The steel pile specimens were fabricated using a W6 x 15 beam section made from A36 structural steel. Each steel pileTitle no. 99-S76 Seal Slab/Steel Pile Interface Bond from Full-Scale Testing by Gray Mullins, Ruben Sosa, Rajan Sen, and Moussa Issa Fig. 1\u2014Sheet pile cofferdam with pile-driving template.

On each pile, a line of three 23.8 mm (15/16 in.) diameter holes were drilled into each flange to facilitate the twelve 22 mm (7/8 in.) bolts required to provide the connection to a pullout apparatus. Cofferdam simulation Four 0.76 m-high wood boxes with inside dimensions of 1.4 x 1.4 m were fabricated to simulate the four placement conditions. Plastic sheeting was used to line and seal the boxe s. Wood templates were used to properly position each pile within the simulated cofferdams. The piles were spaced at three times the pile size, that is, the center to center distance was 45 cm. The edge spacing from the center line to the box edge was 1.5 d or 22.5 cm. All piles were identical in length and tip elevation; however, the two different embedment depths of 1.5 d and 2 d were accommodated by varying the bonded and debonded lengths within the concrete. The bonded region (steel to seal slab) was provided at the bottom of the simulated cofferdam in all the specimens. For the 15 cm piles, the bonded length was either 22.5 cm (1.5 d) or 30 cm (2 d). Above this bonded length, the piles were debonded using a thick layer of bitumen (Fig. 3) applied up to a height sufficiently above the anticipated upper surface of the seal slab. The overall slab thickness and debonded region was set such that the bitumen extended at least1d below the upper seal slab surface for all specimens. This minimum debond length was intended to eliminate bearing stress concentrations based on finite element modeling. Three of the four boxes were filled with either fresh water, 3% salt water, or bentonite slurry (Fig. 3). The latter was made by mixing dry, high-yield bentonite and fresh water to achieve slurry properties similar to those in the FDOT specifications.6 The final density achieved was 10 kN/m3 (64 pcf) with a pH of 8 and a viscosity of 37 s (Marsh Cone method). The fourth box served as a control and was therefore not filled. Seal slab placement Class III seal concrete specified by FDOT6 was used. The specified 28-day strength of the seal slab was 21 MPa (3000 psi). This mixture has 330 kg of cement/m3 (560 lb of cement/yd3) and a water-cement ratio ( w/c) of 0.51. The concrete was purchased from a local concrete plant and was pumped through a 76 mm (3 in.) diameter hose. The concrete was placed from the bottom upwards keeping the hose tip below the rising level of concrete. This is similar in place ment and identical in effect to using a tremie pipe.

The pullout frame weighed 2.2 kN fully assembled and required an overhead chain hoist to assemble and/or move. Tension loads were measured using a load cell positioned between the top of the jack and the tension assembly. The stiffened beam transferred load from the base of the jack to a built-up column section that in turn applied uniform compressive stress to the seal slab. Leveling Before the pullout frame was installed, a grout pad was placed around each pile specimen using a high-strength, fast- curing, self-leveling grout. To further assist in this alignment process, a steel bearing plate was placed in the fresh grout and squared with respect to the longitudinal axis of the pile. Instrumentation A data acquisition system was used for monitoring and recording the test data generated. Loads were measured using a load cell and slip was monitored by two displacement transducers. One of the displacement transducers was magneti cally attached to the compression assembly and positioned to record displacement with respect to an external reference beam. This registered any possible seal slab surface crushing or settlement that might occur during testing. The other displacement transducer was attached to the tension assembly and referenced to the top of the compression assembly. This recorded specimen movement as well as the compliance of the frame that was later accounted for in the data reduction. Test procedure Pullout tests began after the seal slab had been cured for 72 h in accordance with FDOT requirements. Concrete cylinders were tested at periodic intervals to monitor the change in compressive strength. The tension assembly was bolted to the piles using 22 mm (7/8 in.) diameter bolts. Once the grout had time to cure (approximately 15 min), the compress ion assembly was lowered onto the bearing plate. The stiffened beam along with the hydraulic jack were then positioned between the compression section and the upper end of the tension assembly as shown in Fig. 4. With the specimens set up, the pullout test commenced. The tensile load was increased slowly using a manually operated toggle switch that intermittently engaged the power to the hydraulic pump. The load was increased slowly to reduce any possible dynamic stiffening of the system. Each specimen was displaced at least 25 mm. RESULTS A summary of the test results is presented in Table 1. This provides information from the eight tests and contains detailsof the compressive strength, the failure load, and the average bond stress. Over the duration of the tests, there was no change in the compressive strength. The following observations may be made: 1. Significant bond stresses were developed; the highest value obtained was 3.66 MPa (salt water/1.5 d), and the lowest was 1.27 MPa (bentonite/2 d). The highest values varied with embedment depth. For 1.5 d embedment, the highest was for salt water followed by controls and fresh water. For 2 d, control values were highest followed by fresh water then salt water; 2. The magnitude of the bond stress decreased with an increase in embedment depth. This suggests that the distribution of bond stress is nonuniform; 3. The results for bentonite slurry were surprisingly good. Indeed, for embedment depth of 1.5 d, values obtained were comparable to that for fresh water; and 4. Values for salt and fresh water are similar. FULL-SCALE STUDY The pilot study provided important information on the magnitude of the interface steel/seal bond that could devel op. The significant scatter in the results indicated the need to conduct additional tests. These findings led to refinements in the full-scale test program. The principal changes were: 1) elimination of the salt water condition\u2014this was based on the results of more exten sive tests carried out on prestressed piles;3 2) considera tion of the effect of soil-caked surface; and 3) increase in the number of specimens. In view of the very high bond stresses that were obtained, the depth of embedment was limited to 1.5 d except for bentonite, where the maximum depth was increased to 2 d. In add ition, embedment depths of 0.5 d were investigated for the control and fresh water placement conditions. With three different placement conditions (control, fresh water, and bentonite), two different embedment depths ( d, 1.5d, or 2 d), and two specimens per test, a total of 12 specimens were required. Four additional specimens were tested\u2014 one each for embedment depth of 0.5 d (for the control and fresh water condition) and two for investigating the effect of soil caking for the bentonite slurry for an embedment depth of 1d. Thus, the controls and the fresh water condition each had five specimens, and the bentonite slurry condition had six specimens. These were identical to the conditions investigated for prestressed piles.3 The depth (35 cm) and length of the steel piles was kept the same as that for the prestressed piles. As a result, 1.52 m- long W14 x 90 sections made from A36 steel were used. Holes for 28.6 mm (1-1/8 in.) diameter bolts were drilled in each flange to connect the pile specimens to the tension assembly frame (Fig. 5).*Seal slab was cracked prior to testing due to earlier testing of adjacent pile.Table 1\u2014Summary of pilot test results Type Specimen fc, MPa Bond length Bond area, m2Pullout load, kN Bond stress, MPa Control 611 H42 Structural Journal/ November-December 2002Simulated cofferdam Three cofferdams had to be constructed for the three conditions that were investigated. Two of these\u2014fresh water and control\u2014were identical in size. The bentonite slurry condition with the larger number of specimens was larger. The dimensions of the cofferdam were determined by specimens and edge distances that were kept the same 3 d (1.06 m) as in the pilot study. The cofferdams were constructed using rented steel reinforced plywood box forms connected to each other using wedge pins provided by the manufacturer. They were also externally braced using wooden stakes and a 2 x 4 framework. Addit ionally, each cofferdam was lined with 0.2 mm (6 mil) plastic sheeti ng. This provided a water-tight barrier, prevent ing the loss of any construction fluid (water or bentonite slurry). Figure 5 shows one of the cofferdams just prior to filling with fluid. Specimen support Following the construction of the cofferdam, the specim ens were accurately positioned on plywood pads to prevent damage to the plastic lining. The specimens were verticallysupported with a wooden 2 x 4 framework that was secured to the box forms (Fig. 5). Debonded surface As in the pilot study, differing lengths (0.5 d, 1d , 1.5d, and 2d) of the pile surface were bonded or debonded. Debonding was achieved in the identical manner as in the pilot study. The bonded steel surfaces were left in their natural state except for the two specimens that were tested for the soil- caked condition. For this case, an adhesive clay soil, typical ly used for clay models by artists, was used because it bonded better than the kaolinite paste tested in the pilot study.3 The debonded length extended from the boundary of the bonded region to approximately 15 cm above the intended elevation of the finished surface of the seal slab. This included an additional 35 cm length determined as needed by finite elem ent analysis to ensure uniform distribution of compressive loads to the seal slab surrounding the bonded region. Placement conditions One cofferdam was left dry prior to concrete placement (control); the second was filled with fresh water from a nearby potable source. The third was filled with bentonite slurry that was made by mixing dry, high-yield bentonite and fresh water. The mixing was accomplished through the use of a shear pump. Enough bentonite clay was added to achieve slurry properties similar to FDOT specifications. The final density achieved was 10 kN/m3 (65 lb/ft3) with a viscosity of 40 s (Marsh Cone method) and a pH of 8. Seal slab placement Seal concrete was placed using a concrete pump truck. The concrete was pumped through a 15 cm (6 in.) diameter hose and was placed from the bottom upwards keeping the hose tip below the rising level of concrete. This is similar in placement and identical in effect to the tremie method. Fig. 6\u2014Full-scale test apparatus. Fig. 5\u2014Steel piles in simulated cofferdam. (Prestressed piles were also tested in the same bed.) 418ACI Structural Journal/ November-December 2002 761Testing apparatus Identical considerations of capacity, economy, and portabili ty dictated the design of the pullout equipment. A steel reaction frame was designed to take advantage of an available double- acting, 2670 kN (300 ton) hydraulic jack that would be operated with a portable 69 MPa (10 ksi) hydraulic pump system. The frame required connection designs for both concrete and steel pile types. Additionally, the frame would need to be integrated with electronic devices to measure load and displacement. As for the pilot test, the reaction frame consisted of a tension and compression assembly. The tension assembly was connected directly to the pile with two splice plates and housed the hydraulic jack and load cell. The compression assembly applied compressive loads to the seal slab. Fig ure 6 shows a photograph of the complete assembly being placed over a pile specimen. Additional information on the design and fabrication may be found elsewhere.4 Test procedure The test setup and procedure was similar to the pilot study involving placing a grout layer, connecting the tension assembly to the pile, lowering the compression assembly onto the leveled grout surface, attaching the appropriate instrumentation, and extracting the specimens. Some variations, however, were adopted to expedite the testing procedure so less variation in concrete strength would be observed after the 72-h FDOT curing period. Because no concrete vibration or finishing is used in seal slab construction, various degrees of surface roughness developed in the submerged conditions. Instead of leveling the base of each pile individually, all cofferdams were leve led at the same time with a skim coat of grout batched from a single truck. The grout was placed and finished 2 days after the placement of the cast-in-place (CIP) seal slab without adding significant delay before testing could commence. The bentonite placement condition had the greatest degree of un- evenness, whereas the control was more uniformly placed due to the visual input during its placement (although unfinished). Because the debonded portion of each pile specimen extended well above the CIP slab, there were no difficulties with possible bonding of the grout to the piles (Fig. 7). Although much larger than the model scale device, the pullout apparatus could be attached more quickly due to easyaccess of the splice plate bolts. It was also left fully assembled between tests. Instrumentation and data acquisition at tached to the device was again similar to the model scale tests with the exception of the load cell capacity (2670 kN) that was sized to accommodate the increased loads. One of two displacement gages was magnetically attached to the pile and refere nced to the top of the slab. The other gage was magnetically attached to the pile and referenced to an external reference beam to monitor global movements. The tensile load was increased slowly using a manually operated toggle switch that intermittently engaged the power to the hydraulic pump. The load was increased slowly to reduce any possible dynamic stiffening of the system. Each specimen was displaced upward at least 25 mm to ensure that the bond capacity had been fully developed. RESULTS A summary of the test results is presented in Table 2.

Inspection of Table 2 shows that the bond stresses were quite low compared with the pilot study. The highest value was 1.63 MPa (control/0.5 d) and the lowest was 0.50 MPa (bentonite/2 d). Trends observed in the pilot tests were repeated, however; the average bond stresses declined with inc reased embedment depth. For example, the average bond stress reduces from 1.31 to 1.07 MPa for a fresh water embedment depth increase from d to 1.5 d. Variations in concrete strength over the duration of the test may also be noted. The lowest compressive strength was for the bentonite series ( fc = 23.5 MPa) and the highest for the controls (32 MPa). The bond strength is normalized to a 23.5 MPa con- crete strength in Table 2 by dividing the measured values by the percent increase in the square root of the concrete strength. For example, the control values were normalized as follows Representative load versus displacement plots are shown for each of the simulated cofferdam conditions in Fig. 8 to 10. Each graph also shows the effect of embedment depth on the pullout response for the various conditions. The control and fresh water environments showed similar results for normalized bond values of 1.20 and 1.21 MPa, respectively. Likewise, the trends associated with the effects of embedm ent were comparable (Fig. 8 and 9). The pullout capacity inc reased1.20MPa1.40MPa 23.5 32-------------- =somewhat linearly with embedment depth up to 1 d. This can be noted in both peak and residual values when comparing the 0.5 d and 1 d test results. With longer embedment depths (1.5d), little increase in average capacity was observed (10% in controls and 17% in water). This was also noted in Table 2 where average bond strengths decreased 18% (1.31 to 1.07 MPa) and 27% (1.40 to 1.02 MPa) in the water and control specimens, respectively, for the same increased embed ment depths. Figure 10 shows the pullout response of the piles cast in the bentonite slurry-filled cofferdam. Therein, several differe nces were introduced due to anticipated decreases in bond strength: 1) 0.5 d embedment was not used; 2) the 1.5 d was increased to 2 d; and 3) soil caking was applied to some 1d specimens. The effects of embedment were similar in this set of tests as no significant additional pullout capacity was realized with the additional bond area from 1 d to 2d embedm ent. This is supported by the moderate 19% average increase in pullout with a 100% increase in embedment (670 to 797 kN). This decreased bond efficiency is further illustrated by the 41% decrease in the average bond strength in Table 2 (0.88 to 0.52 MPa). The effect of soil caking was less significant than that of the embedment depth most probably due to the scouring action during the seal slab placement. In general, the bentonite condition produced larger variations in the measured bond values. The overall findings, however, indic ate that the bond between steel and seal slabs is significantly higher than specified in design codes. DISCUSSION The goal of the study was to determine the interface bond between steel piles and seal slabs that had been cast in accordance with existing construction specifications (concrete piles were also tested). As the FDOT specifications allow a 72 h cure period for the seal slab, the need to develop a scheme that met the requirement for rapid testing without compromising the results was of critical importance. Pullout testing was used and several innovative measures adopted to expedite the testing process. In the model study, 36 tests (28 concrete and eight steel) were completed within 8 h following the 72 h cure period. During this time, no changes in concrete strength were observed. In the full-scale tests, greater time was required to complete the testing. An important constraint was access to heavy lifting equipment (and an operator) to move the pull- out frame after every test. All 32 tests (16 concrete and 16Fig. 8\u2014Water-filled cofferdam test results. Fig. 9\u2014Control cofferdam test cofferdam test results. 420ACI Structural Journal/ November-December 2002 763steel), however, were completed within 10 days of the casti ng of the seal slab. As concrete strengths were evaluated throughout the test period, the relationship between the interface bond and con crete strength was used to normalize the bond values. Taking into consideration the totality of the study, the model and full-scale results provide a good indic ation of the magnitude of the interface bond that develops be tween the seal concrete and piles. The results from the model tests gave higher bond values than those from the full-scale tests (Table 1 and 2). Similar trends were observed in the tests on the prestressed piles,3 though the differences were much smaller. This is most like ly because the surfaces of the steel piles in the full-scale tests were smoother compared with those used in the model tests. In contrast, the concrete surfaces in both model and full- scale tests were similar. As with prestressed piles, the results clearly indicate that the variation in the interface bond is nonlinear since the pullout load was not proportional to the embedment depth. Unfortun ately, this distribution could not be measured without introducing surficial anomalies due to instrumentation. In the concrete piles where strain gages could be embedded during casting, however, this relationship could be ascertained.3 The nonline arity in the interface shear distribution was indirectly incorporated in the proposed recommendation by defining an effective embedment depth. Embedment in excess of this effective depth did not contribute significantly towards the total resistance (Fig. 8 to 10). CONCLUSIONS This study presents results from an experimental study that attempted to determine the interface bond stress that developed between seal concrete and steel piles. Two series of tests were conducted. In the first series, a 1/3-scale model was fabricat ed and tested. Three different placement conditions were inves- tigated: displacement of fresh water, salt water, and bentonite slurry for two different embedment depths. In the second series, full-scale tests were conducted for two different conditions: fresh water and bentonite slurry. In all cases, results were compared against controls where no fluid was displaced. Seal slabs were cast using concrete delivered by ready-mix plants and conformed to Class III concrete in current FDOT specifications. The concrete was allowed to cure for at least 72 h prior to testing as permitted by existing specifications. The following conclusions may be drawn: 1. Bond stresses determined experimentally were signifi- cantly higher than set in current specifications. Average val ues obtained from the full-scale tests varied between 1.1 and 1.3 MPa for fresh water displacement and 0.5 and 0.9 MPa for bentonite displacement. The lowest value obtained was for piles embedded in bentonite cofferdam at depth 2 d; 2. Bond strength varied with embedment depth as indicated by both the model and full-scale test results. This implies thatthicker seal slabs cannot develop full bond capacity simultan eously along the entire bonded area beyond a maximum length. Instead, they develop full capacity over shorter bonded lengths dependent on the concrete shear strain limit value with respect to the elongation of the pile. In this case it was shown that embedment depths in excess of 1 d were ineffect ive in supplying additional pullout capacity; 3. The results of the study confirm the poorer interface bond for steel surfaces compared with concrete, where 1 d average values for water and bentonite conditions were 2.7 and 2.5 MPa, respectively;4 and 4. Variations between the model-scale and full-scale test results can be in part attributed to the surface roughness of the as-delivered steel piles. The model piles were partially oxidized, whereas the full-scale piles had never been exposed to an outdoor environment prior to placement. The recommended values are based on the full-scale test results that are therefore conservative. RECOMMENDATIONS Loads supported by the bond between seal concrete and steel piles (section depth d, perimeter p, embedded depth D in seal slab) may be determined from the allowable bond stress Fb listed in Table 3. This stress may be assumed to be uniform over an effective area Ae given by Ae = pD if D < d Ae = pd if D > d In the latest Florida \"Design Guidelines,\"7 allowable interface shear values have been greatly increased based on the findings presented in this paper.

Concerns of soil disturbance at the shaft tip (i.e. insitu stress relief) and cleanliness also discourage the use of end bearing as available capacity within any reasonable service load displacement criteria. Pressure grouting the shaft tip has been successfully employed throughout the world as a method of mitigating these conditions. However, there is an apparent lack of ration design procedures and construction guidelines for its use. In cooperation with the Florida Department of Transportation, the University of South Florida is researching the effects of post-grouting on shaft capacity. This paper describes two sites at which full scale shafts have been tested: (1) five shafts, including one control shaft, tipped in a shelly sand, and (2) three shafts, including one control shaft, tipped in a silty sand. The results of these tests show that significant tip capacity improvement can be realized through the use of pressure grouting drilled shaft tips. Introduction When designing for drilled shaft capacities in sandy soils, engineers typically must significantly reduce end bearing capacity or even discount it altogether to account for potential soft toe conditions. Even in ideal conditions, end bearing is typically not mobilized before service load displacement criteria are exceeded. The bulk of the capacity is therefore derived from side friction which can be developed with relatively small displacements. This is particularly a problem for larger shafts in cohesionless soils which must displace even further to fully develop tip capacity (e.g. AASHTO tip capacities are based on top of shaft displacements of 5% of the shaft diameter). Consequently, the end bearing strength component, which may be on the order of up to twenty times the side friction component, is unavailable to the shafts useful capacity. 335 Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208. Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://www.ascelibrary.org 422336 DEEP FOUNDATIONS 2002 As the end bearing component of drilled shafts is highly under-utilized, mechanistic procedures to integrate its contribution have been developed using pressure grouting. Pressure grouting the tips of drilled shafts has been successfully used world wide to precompress soft debris or loose soil relaxed by excavation (Bolognesi and Moretto, 1973; Stoker, 1983; Bruce, 1986; Fleming, 1993; Mullins et. al, 2000). However, the absence of its use in the United States is probably due to associated uncertainties and the lack of a rational design method. Recognizing this shortfall, the Florida Department of Transportation issued a request for proposals (RFP) to assess the effect of pressure grouting on drilled shaft tip capacity. In June 1999, the University of South Florida commenced a two-year research program to investigate this technique. The overall objectives of this study were to quantify the improvement that could be developed by pressure grouting the tip of drilled shafts and to develop design guidelines for its use. This paper discusses the results relating to the first objective, the pressure grouting and load testing of drilled shafts in sandy soils. A full discussion of the results of the entire research can be found elsewhere (Mullins, et. al, 2001). Research Program The research program outlined below is only a portion of a larger project which also included small scale (1:10) laboratory testing in a frustum confining vessel, computer modeling of pressure grouted drilled shaft tips, and two 1.22 m (4.0 ft.) diameter shafts tipped in cemented coquina. This portion discusses the field results from six 0.61 m (2.0 ft.) diameter drilled shafts cast, pressure grouted, and subsequently load tested. The performance of the pressure grouting is based on comparisons with two additional ungrouted control shafts. A total of eight shafts were constructed, pressure grouted, and load tested at two sites located on a large property (20 acres) in Clearwater, Florida. Shafts at Site I were tipped in a shelly sand. A dimensioned layout of Site I showing the shaft positions, CPT soundings, and SPT borings conducted within the Site are provided in Figure 1; typical CPT and SPT data are shown in Figure 2. Shafts at Site II were tipped in a silty silica sand. The layout of Site II is shown in Figure 3, while typical CPT and SPT data are shown as Figure 4. The shafts were each 0.61 m (2.0 ft) diameter and were all approximately 4.57 m (15.0 ft.) long. Five shafts, including one control, were tested at Site I; three shafts, including one control, were tested at Site II. All pressure grouting was conducted using an auger style grout pump. All of the shafts were then load tested using a 4 MN Statnamic device with a hydraulic catch mechanism. The results from the grouted shafts have been compared their respective control shafts to assess the load capacity improvement obtained from the tip grouting process. Site Investigation These sites were chosen and the tip elevations set, based upon an exploratory investigation program which looked for the types of soil most likely to be improved with tip grouting (Mullins et. al, 2000), loose to medium dense sands. The sand particles at these two sites span the diverse range that can be encountered in cohesionless soils (shelly to silty). The shelly of Site I was very angular and fiat, while the silty silica sand was very smooth and round. Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208.

A tim-jack consists of a steel plate wrapped in a rubber membrane thus providing a debonded pressurizing surface beneath the shaft tip. Sleeve-port systems use a rubber tube over a performed pipe section which provides a smaller grouting area, but more flexibility in staged grouting applications. A summary of the grout distribution systems used is contained in Table 1. Two tim-jack devices had the grout pressure locked in during the grout cure, while one did not. Two sleeve- port devices had a steel plate above them, while one did not. Table 1. Grouting Apparatus.

Flat-Jacks All flat-jacks were identical in construction; however, one in Site I was allowed to release grout pressure immediately after grouting. The remaining two, one in Site I and one in Site II, had the grout pressure locked in with the use of a ball valve in the grout supply lines during the grout cure. Figure 5 illustrates the flat-jack tip grouting apparatus. A scuffring was incorporated into the design of the flat-jacks, which protected the 0.8 mm (I/32 in.) thick natural gum rubber membrane where it wraps around the edge of the plate. This was to ensure durability in the event that the cage was improperly handled during placement. Further, the scuff ring had tabs attached to the top which allowed for the ring to be bolted to the steel plate, therefore providing a better seal between the rubber membrane and the top plate (rather than just relying on the rubber cement contact adhesive alone). The flat-j ack apparatus was tied into the reinforcing cage, and securely fixed in place. Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208.

Sleeve-port systems were identical in construction with the exception that one in Site I did not have a steel plate above it, as is shown in Figure 6. Note that all the sleeve ports locked in the grout pressure due to the nature of their design. The two tip grouted shafts in Site II were also skin grouted, while their respective control shaft was not. The skin grouting of Site II shafts provided more reaction during tip grouting that would not have otherwise been available. Discussion of skin grouting will otherwise not be addressed here. The grout delivery pipe consisted of a 254 mm (10 in.) section of 19mm ( 3/4 in.) galvanized steel pipe with 7 pairs of diametrically opposed 6mm (1/4 in.) grout delivery ports drilled through both pipe walls at any location along the pipe. These 7 sets of ports alternated in circumferential position by 90 ~ and were equally spaced along the length of the pipe. A natural gum rubber tube (the sleeve) with an initial inside diameter of approximately 24mm (15/16 in.), and a wall thickness of 6mm (1/4 in.) was then pulled over the grout delivery pipe, Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208. Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://www.ascelibrary.org 427DEEP FOUNDATIONS 2002 341 with the use of soapy water as a lubricant. Altemately, baby powder and compressed air can be used to install the sleeve. The elastic stretch in the rubber tube was needed to seal the grout delivery system during shaft construction, and acts as a one way valve to allow for staged grouting. Often in industry, electrical tape will be wrapped around the edges of the rubber tube to ensure that the pipe is not infiltrated by concrete/cement during shaft construction. When the option of a steel plate above the sleeve-port apparatus was utilized, each plate had four 38mm (1-1/2 in.) diameter holes drilled through. The male fitting from the grout pipe would then simply fit through the hole in the plate and screw into the female 900 elbow ends of the sleeve-port. The system was constructed in this way such that the plate assembly could be tied into the cage via its reinforcing bar tie attachments, and thus its weight (or any forces experienced during placement) would not be supported by the pressure fittings to the sleeve- port.

The two systems used during the test were a MEGADAC manufactured by Optim Electronics, and the Foundation Pile Diagnostic System (FPDS) made by The Netherlands Organization (TNO). A variety of transducers were utilized, in both the grouting and load testing operations. Table 2 shows this system arrangement, and the transducers that were monitored during grouting and load testing operations. Table 2. Data Acquisition and Instrumentation.

A laser sensor is also built into this piston which provides a direct measurement of displacement during load testing. Accelerometers are used to confirm displacement and provide direct measurements of acceleration. Top of shaft displacement during grouting operations was directly measured utilizing linear voltage differential transformers (LVDT's), while bottom of shaft displacements were made with linear cable potentiometers attached to tension tell-tales. Grout pressure was monitored by a pressure gage in-line with the grout supply hose. A rubber membrane and grease pocket within the fitting protected the instrument from the grout. Strain gages in groups of three were embedded at two levels within the shaft at approximately 0.46 m (1.5 ft.) and 3.2 m (10.5 ft.) from the shaft tip. These strain measurements yield the force at these levels using a composite shaft modulus determined by concrete strengths (concrete cylinder breaks), and the area fraction of steel reinforcement. The tension tell-tales consisted ofa 12mm casing (\u000189 in. schedule 40 PVC pipe), capped at the bottom end, and a stainless steel braided cable strtmg through the center of the casing. The steel braided cable was secured to the bottom end of the casing through the end cap, clamped, Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208.

Ample length was left outside the end cap and looped to provide development length for tension that would be put upon it during their use in grouting. Significant elastic shaft shortening was not expected during grouting at these sites, nor did it occur. Shaft Construction The vertical reinforcement consisted of six 25 mm (# 8) reinforcement bars equally spaced about the perimeter. The stirrup reinforcement consisted of 16 mm (# 5) reinforcement bars, equally spaced every 0.46 m (1.5 ft.). All reinforcing bars used were Grade 60. The finished cages were 4.42 m (14.5 ft.) in length, and had an outside diameter at the stirrups of 0.46m (1.5 ft.). The grout pipes were made from 25mm (1 in.) high density polyethylene (HDPE) tubing (CTS SDR-9). A 25mm (1 in.) male pipe thread fitting was secured at either end of the grout pipe made of brass (C84-44 1\" CTS Compression MIPT Adapter) and had thin stainless steel inserts (#52 Stainless Insert) to keep the tubing from being crushed by the pipe fitting. These materials are common and readily available. This male fitting could suitably connection to either type of grouting apparatus used. This system has a working pressure rating of 1000- 1400 kPa (150-200 psi), and was more than adequate for the grouting pressures experienced on this site. This system of continuous rolled tubing was easy to install, and would be especially convenient with long multi-section reinforcing cages.

Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://www.ascelibrary.org 43034,1 DEEP FOUNDATIONS 2002 A truck mounted Texoma 700 drill rig was utilized to excavate the shafts of Site I, while a track mounted BG-7 drill rig was used to excavate Site II. Both were excavated using a synthetic slurry. Both Site I and II utilized the same drill auger in construction. A clean-out bucket was not used during construction as it would not produce a significant improvement in tip condition, nor would the use of standard down-hole or air-lift pumps. Even under ideal conditions it is essentially impossible to thoroughly \"clean out\" any shaft excavation at the tip, as is customary with rock socketed tips, as any action taken simply tends to further upset the excavation. A benefit of tip grouting is that this condition is mitigated, and is a point that this study confirmed. A Hitachi 60 ton track mounted hydraulic crane was used to pick and set the cages. Site I Flat-Jack 2 (locked-in pressure) was set nearly 0.3 m (1.0 ft.) too high due to a tight tolerance between the plate and borehole. Careful observations of the grouting of this shaft confirmed that 51 liters (1.8 ft.3)ofgrout was needed to fill the void under the fiat-jack plate before any grout pressure above that required to pump the grout through he lines could be detected. This represents a volume that would be equivalent to a column the same diameter as the fiat-jack by 0.22m (0.7 ft.) high. As a direct result, an unanticipated variable was tested between the two flat-Jacks of Site I; the effect of varying amounts of soft debris and/or voids below the fiat-jack grouting apparatus. Results show that this condition was mitigated by the tip grouting procedure, this grout volume of 51 liters (1.8 ft.3) is not included in the subsequent analysis. Grouting and Load Testing The grouting at these sites was then accomplished using a helical style grout pump and paddle type mixer, as shown in Figure 8. The pump was adequate, as shaft uplift or grout volume proved to be the limitation at all test shafts. In all cases the shaft concrete was allowed to gain sufficient strength before grouting operations commenced. The grout mix utilized was a water-cement slurry (Type I and II cement) with a water to cement ratio of 0.5. The grouting lines of both sleeve-port and flat-jack apparatus were gently flushed with grout before the return lines were capped and grout pressure was applied. Prior to any grouting work, the sleeve-port apparatus on these sites were \"burst\" open using water pressure. This was done the day following concrete placement, as is common practice, such that the concrete had set up, yet had not gained significant strength. The intent of this action is to open a path for subsequent grouting, which may be performed at a later date when the shaft has reached acceptable strength. The volumetric flow during this process should be minimal to reduce the soil disturbance. The helical style grout pump was first used; however a small widely available pressure washer was better suited for this task. The load testing was carried out with the use ofa 4 MN Statnamic device after the grout was given time to obtain sufficient strength. A minimum of three load cycles were performed on each test shaft. The hydraulic catch mechanism made reloading of the shaft proceed rapidly, as all three load cycles would typically occur within a 30 minute time span. In all cases the test shafts were displaced many times more than the ultimate capacity displacement, such that the load vs. displacement response would be fully defined.

The grouting rate should be slow enough to build pressure, and not simply hydrofracture the soil. The grout consistency can be adjusted to control this aspect. The maximum sustained grout pressure, peak upward displacement, and total grout volume for each of the grouted shafts are listed in Table 3. In general, the fiat-jacks have a lower grout take than the sleeve-ports due to the flat-jacks acting as a confined pressure cell. Conversely, the grout from the sleeve-ports is in intimate contact with the surrounding soil matrix, and thus has a greater potential to migrate away from the immediate tip area. Table 3.

The \"bottom-up\" load displacement response of a shaft is obtained when combining these time traces with the load based upon strain gage data, as is consistent with bi-directional load testing procedures. The measured displacement is the shaft uplift, and the load is the side friction component, which is equal but opposite to that of the end beating component. In order to compare the grout pressure readings to this curve, a shaft tip load is also calculated by multiplying the pressure reading by the shaft tip cross-sectional area. Typical shaft response during grouting utilizing fiat-jack apparatus is presented as Figure 10. The shaft tip loads calculated by means of both the strain gage and grout pressure data correspond extremely well to each other, even at the beginning of the grouting cycle.

This illustrates the strong advantage of a flat-jack apparatus in a production setting providing a \"proof test\" of the shaft capacity. The load displacement response of every grouted shaft can be obtained by simply utilizing top of shaft displacements and grout pressure. If the shafts are significant in length, the elastic shortening must be considered. An ungrouted control shaft, was constructed and load tested at both Sites I and II, such that the improvement in load capacity due to pressure grouting could be assessed by direct comparison to its respective control shaft. Figure 11 presents a typical shaft load comparison. Both the top and tip of shaft response is shown for both a grouted and ungrouted control shaft. As most tip resistance designs are based on an assumed displacement of 5% of the shaft diameter, (e.g. Reese and O'Neill, 1988), the improvement in shaft tip and total capacity is evaluated at displacements of 5% of the shaft diameter for all the test shafts, as summarized in Table 4.

The greatest amount of tip improvement occurred in Site I at a displacement of only 2% of the shaft diameter, 12 mm (0.48 in.), and in Site II at a displacement of 4% to 5% of the shaft diameter, 24 mm (0.96 in.) to 30 mm (1.20 in.). Undoubtedly, this was due to the tip grouting locking in some amount of negative side shear, and thus more readily transferring the subsequent load to the shaft tip which was also prestressed in compression. Although the total shaft improvement is more modest, the increased stiffness of the grouted shaft aides in meeting service limit displacements. Summary The field results of a two year, full-scale load testing program have been presented identifying the magnitude of improvement that can be obtained by pressure grouting drilled shaft tips. Three grout distribution systems were used: (1) flat-jack, (2) sleeve-port, and (3) sleeve-port and plate. A total of eight test shafts were constructed and tested at two sites, Site I (shelly sand) and Site II (silty sand). All grouted shafts showed increased tip capacity, regardless of distribution system, when compared to ungrouted control shafts. Sleeve-port systems developed higher grout pressures, while flat-jack systems produced more uniform tip loading and higher uplift displacements. The tip improvement (at 0.05 shaft diameters of displacement) for sleeve-port systems was 455% and 843% for Sites I and II, respectively. Flat-jack systems produced 264% and 643% improvement, similarly. Although not presented herein, a design procedure has been developed based on the results of this research which is being incorporated into the FDOT design guidelines. Figure 12.

The Unloading Point (UP) method requires that the foundation move as a rigid body, thus excluding stress wave phenomenon from the analysis. If this requirement is met the foundation capacity can be determined using this simplified method. However, many foundations do not meet the UP criteria (e.g. fixed end or relatively long piles) and have proven difficult to analyze without more complex techniques. This paper presents a new analysis method that uses measured strain data as well as the standard Statnamic test data to determine foundation capacity. This new method discretizes the foundation into smaller segments that each meet the rigid body criteria of the UP method. Thereby, a more refined inertia and viscous damping evaluation can be implemented that individually determines the contributions from the various segments. This approach, termed the \"Segmental Unloading Point\" (SUP) method, is developed herein and then demonstrated with results from full-scale Statnamic test data. Introduction Since its inception in1988, Statnamic testing of deep foundations has gained popularity with many designers largely due to its time efficiency, cost effectiveness, data quality, and flexibility in testing existing foundations. Where large capacity static tests may take up to a week to set up and conduct, the largest of Statnamic tests typically takes no more than a few days. Further, multiple smaller-capacity tests can easily be completed within a day. The direct benefit of this time efficiency is the cost savings to the client and the ability to conduct more tests within a given budget. Additionally, this test method has boosted quality assurance by giving the contractor the ability to test foundations thought to have been compromised by construction difficulties without significantly affecting production. Statnamic testing is designated as a rapid load test that uses the inertia of a relatively small reaction mass instead of a reaction structure to produce large forces. Rapid load tests are differentiated from static and dynamic load tests by comparing the duration of the loading 915 Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208. Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://www.ascelibrary.org 438916 DEEP FOUNDATIONS 2002 event with respect to the axial natural period of the foundation (2L/C), where L represents the foundation length and C represents the strain wave velocity. Test durations longer than 1000 L/C are considered static loadings and those shorter than 10 L/C are consider dynamic (Janes et al., 2000; Kusakabe et.al, 2000). Tests with a duration between 10L/C and 1000 L/C are denoted as rapid load tests. The duration of the Statnamic test is typically 100 to 120 milliseconds, but is dependant on the ratio of the applied force to the weight of the reaction mass. Longer duration tests of up to 500 milliseconds are possible but require a larger reaction mass. The Statnamic force is produced by quickly-formed high pressure gases that in turn launch a reaction mass upward at up to twenty times the acceleration of gravity. The equal and opposite force exerted on the foundation is simply the product of the mass and acceleration of the reaction mass. It should be noted that the acceleration of the reaction mass is not significant in the analysis of the foundation; it is simply a by-product of the test. Secondly, the load produced is not an impact in that the mass is in contact prior to the test. Further, the test is over long before the masses reach the top of their flight. The parameters of interest are only those associated with the movement of the foundation (i.e. force, displacement, and acceleration). Typical analysis of Statnamic data relies on measured values of force, displacement and acceleration. A soil model is not required, hence, the results are not highly user dependent. A new method of analysis is introduced that extends present methods by incorporating additional measured values of strain at discrete points along the length of the foundation. In the ensuing sections a discussion of analysis methods and their applicability will be presented. Full details on the development of this method can be found elsewhere (Lewis, 1999). Present Analysis Procedures The Statnamic forcing event induces foundation motion in a relatively short period of time and hence acceleration and velocities will be present. The accelerations are typically small(I-2 g's), however the enormous mass of the foundation when accelerated resists movement due to inertia and as such the fundamental equation of motion applies, Equation 1. F = ma + cv + kx (1) where, F = forcing event m = mass of the foundation a = acceleration of the displacing body v = velocity of the displacing body c = viscous damping coefficient k = spring constant of the displacing system x = displacement of the body The equation of motion is generally described using four terms: forcing, inertial, viscous damping, and stiffness. The forcing term (F) denotes the load application which varies with time and is equated to the sum of remaining three terms. The inertial term (ma) is the force which is generated from the tendency of a body to resist motion, or to keep moving once Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208. Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://www.ascelibrary.org 439DEEP FOUNDATIONS 2002 917 it is set in motion (Young, 1992). The viscous damping term (cv) is best described as the velocity dependant resistance to movement. The final term (kx), represents the classic system stiffness, which is the static soil resistance. When this equation is applied to a pile/soil system the terms can be redefined to more accurately describe the system. This is done by including both measured and calculated terms. The revised equation is displayed below: Fstam~mic = (ma)Foundat~on + (CV)Foundatio n + Fstati c (2) where, F~, .......... is the measured Statnamic force, m is the calculated mass of the foundation, a is the measured acceleration of the foundation, c is the viscous damping coefficient, v is the calculated velocity, and F,,,,,,~. is the derived pile/soil static response. There are two unknowns in the revised equation F~,~,,~. and c, thus the equation is under specified. F~,~,,~. is the desired value, so the variable c must be obtained to solve the equation. Middendorp (1992) presented a method to calculate the damping coefficient referred to as the Unloading Point Method (UP). With the value of c known, the static force can be calculated. This force, termed \"Derived Static,\" represents an equivalent soil response similar to that produced by a traditional static load test. UP Description The UP is a simple method which allows the equivalent static resistance to be derived from the measured Statnamic quantities. It uses a simple single degree of freedom model to represent the foundation/soil system as a rigid body supported by a non-linear spring and a linear dashpot in parallel (see Figure 1). The spring represents the static soil response (Fs~,~) which includes the elastic response of the foundation as well as the foundation/soil interface and surrounding soil response. The dashpot is used to represent the dynamic resistance which depends on the rate of pile penetration (Nishimura, 1995). The UP makes two primary assumptions in its determination of\"c?' The first is the static capacity of the pile is constant when it plunges as a rigid body. The second is that the damping coefficient is constant throughout the test. By doing so a time window is defined in which to calculate the damping coefficient as shown in Figure 2. This figure shows a typical Statnamic load-displacement curve which denotes points (1) and (2). The first point of interest (1) is that of maximum Statnamic Force. At this point the static resistance is assumed to have become steady state, for the purpose of calculating \"e\". Thus, any extra resistance is attributed to that of the dynamic forces (ma and cv). The next point of interest (2) is that of zero velocity which has been termed the \"Unloading Point.\" At this point the foundation is no longer moving and the resistance due to damping is zero. The static resistance, used to calculate \"c\" from point (1) to (2), can then be calculated by the following equation: (3) where, Fs, ........ ,c, m, and a are all known parameters; F s,o,,~,, p is the static force calculated at (2) and assumed constant from (1) to (2).

The following equation is used to calculate c: Fstatnarnic- Fstaticup- (ma)Foundatio n c : (4) V Foundation Damping values over this range should be fairly constant. Often the average value is taken as the damping constant, but if a constant value occurs over a long period of time it should be used (see Figure 3). Note that as v approaches zero at point (2), values ofc can be different from that of the most representative value and therefore the entire trend should be reviewed.

Variation in c between times (1) and (2). Currently software is available to the public that can be used in conjunction with Statnamic test data to calculate the derived static pile capacity using the UP Method (Garbin, 1999). This software was developed by the University of South Florida and the Federal Highway Administration and can be downloaded from www. eng. usfedu,/~gmullins under the Statnamic Analysis Workbook (SAW TM) heading. UP Shortcomings The UP has proven to be a valuable tool in predicting damping values when the foundation acts as a rigid body. However, as the pile length increases an appreciable delay can be introduced between the movement of the pile top and toe, hence negating the rigid body assumption. This occurrence also becomes prevalent when an end bearing condition exists; in this case the lower portion of the foundation is prevented from moving jointly with the top of the foundation. Middendorp (1995) defines the \"'Wave Number\" (N,,) to quantify the applicability of the UP. The wave number is calculated by dividing the wave length (D) by the foundation depth (L). D is obtained by multiplying the wave speed c in length per second by the load duration (T) in seconds. Thus, the wave number is calculated by the following equation: D cT N~, = L L (6) Through empirical studies Middendorp determined that the UP would accurately predict static capacity, from Statnamic data, if the wave number is greater than 12. Nishimura (1995) established a similar threashold at a wave number of 10. Using wave speeds of 5000 m/s and 4000 m/s for steel and concrete respectively and a typical Statnamic load duration, the UP is limited to piles shorter than 50 m (steel) and 40 m (concrete). Wave number analysis Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208. Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://www.ascelibrary.org 442920 DEEP FOUNDATIONS 2002 can be used to determine if stress waves will develop in the pile. However, this does not necessarily satisfy the rigid body requirement of the UP. Statnamic tests cannot always produce wave numbers greater than 10, and as such there have been several methods suggested to accommodate stress wave phenomena in Statnamically tested long piles (Middendorp, 1995). Due to limitations on paper length these methods are not presented. Modified Unloading Point Method Given the shortcomings of the UP, users of Statnamic testing have developed a remedy for the problematic condition that arises most commonly. The scenario involves relatively short piles (N,,.> 10) that do not exhibit rigid body motion, but rather elastically shorten within the same magnitude as the permanent set. This is typical of rock-socketed drilled shafts or piles driven to dense bearing strata that are not fully mobilized during testing. The consequence is that the top of pile response (i.e. acceleration, velocity, and displacement) is significantly different from that of the toe. The most drastic subset of these test results show zero movement at the toe while the top of pile elastically displaces in excess of the surficial yield limit (e.g. upwards of 25 mm). Whereas with plunging piles (rigid body motion) the difference in movement (top to toe) is minimal and the average acceleration is essentially the same as the top of pile acceleration; tip restrained piles will exhibit an inertial term that is twice as large when using top of pile movement measurements to represent the entire pile. The Modified Unloading Point Method (MUP), developed by Justason (1997), makes use of an additional toe accelerometer that measures the toe response. The entire pile is still assumed to be a single mass, m, but the acceleration of the mass is now defined by the average of the top and toe movements. A standard UP is then conducted using the applied top of pile Statnamic force and the average accelerations and velocities. The derived static force is then plotted versus the top of pile displacement as before. This simple extension of the UP has successfully overcome most problematic data sets. Plunging piles instrumented with both top and toe accelerometers have shown little analytical difference between the UP and the MUP. However, MUP analyses are now recommended whenever both top and toe information is available. Need For Advancement Although the MUP provided a more refined approach to some of the problems associated with UP conditions, there still exists a scenario where it is difficult to interpret Statnamic data with present methods. This is when the wave number is less than ten (relatively long piles). In these cases the pile may still only experience compression (no tension waves) but the delay between top and toe movements causes a phase lag. Hence an average of top and toe movements does not adequately represent the pile. Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208. Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://www.ascelibrary.org 443DEEP FOUNDATIONS 2002 921 SUP Method Description And General Procedure The fundamental concept of the SUP is that the acceleration, velocity, displacement, and force on each segment can be determined using strain gage measurements along the length of the pile. Individual pile segment displacements are determined using the relative displacement as calculated from strain gage measurements and an upper or lower measured displacement. The velocity and acceleration of each segment are then determined by numerically differentiating displacement then velocity with respect to time. The segmental forces are determined by calculating the difference in force from two strain gage levels. Typically the maximum number of segments is dependent on the available number of strain gage layers. However, strain gage placement does not necessitate assignment of segmental boundaries; as long as the wave number of a given segment is greater than 10, the segment can include several strain gage levels within its boundaries. The number and the elevation of strain gage levels are usually determined based on soil stratification; as such, it can be useful to conduct an individual segmental analysis to produce the shear strength parameters for each soil strata. A reasonable upper limit on the number of segments should be adopted because of the large number of mathematical computations required to complete each analysis. Figure 4 is a sketch of the SUP pile discretization. The notation used for the general SUP case defines the pile as having rn levels of strain gages and m+I segments. Strain gage locations are labeled using positive integers starting from 1 and continuing through m. The first gage level below the top of the foundation is denoted as GL I where the superscript defines the gage level. Although there are no strain gages at the top of foundation,this elevation is denoted as GL ~ Segments are numbered using positive integers from 1 to m+l, where segment 1 is bounded by the top of foundation (GL ~j) and GU. Any general segment is denoted as segment n and lies between GL \"-~ and GL\". Finally, the bottom segment is denoted as segment m+l and lies between GL m and the foundation toe. Figure 4.

Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://www.ascelibrary.org 444922 DEEP FOUNDATIONS 2002 Calculation Of Segmental Motion Parameters The SUP analysis defines average acceleration, velocity, and displacement traces that are specific to each segment. In doing so, strain measurements from the top and bottom of each segment and a boundary displacement are required. Boundary displacement may come from the Statnamic laser reference system (top), top of pile acceleration data, or from embedded toe accelerometer data. The displacement is calculated at each gage level using the change in recorded strain with respect to an initial time zero using Equation 7. Because a linearly-varying strain distribution is assumed between gage levels, the average strain is used to calculate the elastic shortening in each segment. Level displacements Xn = Xn- 1- AEaverage seg n L seg n (7) where x n = the displacement at the nth gage level Ae ..... ~,~,, = the average change in strain in segment n L ~,,~,, = the length of the nth segment To perform an unloading point analysis, only the top-of-segment motion needs to be defined. However, the MUP analysis, which is now recommended, requires both top and bottom parameters. The SUP lends itself naturally to providing this information. Therefore, the average segment movement is used rather than the top-of-segment; hence, the SUP actually performs multiple MUP analyses rather than standard UP. The segmental displacement is then determined using the average of the gage level displacements from each end of the segment as shown in the following equation: Xn 1 + Xn x - (8) seg n 2 where x ,~,, is the average displacement consistent with that of the segment centroid. The velocky and acceleration, as required for MUP, are then determined from the average displacement trace through numerical differentiation using Equations 9 and 10, respectively: x- x (9) vn - At Vt/' V'*I (10) an - ~t where V n t/n At the velocity of segment n the acceleration of segment n the time step from time t to t\u00a7 Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208. Redistribution subject to ASCE license or copyright; see http://www.ascelibrary.org 445DEEP FOUNDATIONS 2002 923 It should be noted that all measured values of laser displacement, strain, and force are time dependent parameters that are field recorded using high speed data acquisition computers. Hence the time step, At, used to calculate velocity and acceleration is a uniform value that can be as small as 0.0002 seconds. Therefore, some consideration should be given when selecting the time step to be used for numerical differentiation. The average motion parameters (x, v, and a) for segment m + 1 can not be ascertained from measured data, but the displacement at GL'\" can be differentiated directly providing the velocity and acceleration. Therefore, the toe segment is evaluated using the standard UP. These segments typically are extremely short (1 - 2 m) producing little to no differential movement along its length. Calculation Of Segmental Statnamic And Derived Static Forces Each segment in the shaft is subjected to a forcing event which causes movement and reaction forces. This segmental force is calculated by subtracting the force at the top of the segment from the force at the bottom. The difference is due to side friction, inertia, and damping for all'segments except the bottom segment. This segment has only one forcing function from GL\"' and the side friction is coupled with the tip bearing component. The force on segment n is defined as: where Sn = A(n-1) E(n-1) e(n-1) - An En en (11) e,, the applied segment force from strain measurements the composite elastic modulus at level n the cross sectional area at level n the measured strain at level n Once the motion and forces are defined along the length of the pile. an unloading point analysis on each segment is conducted.

Site Characteristics And SUP Application Prepared in this section are examples of the motion parameters, segment forces, and load displacement trends as analyzed by SUP. The foundation was instrumented with four strain gage levels (m = 4) which produced five segments. Data was obtained at the 17 th Street Causeway Replacement Bridge project as part of an extensive load test program implemented by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), which included Statnamic load tests. Statnamic load testing was performed using a 30MN Statnamic device equipped with a gravel catch structure. Shaft instrumentation consisted of standard Statnamic equipment as well as, resistive type strain gages, and a toe accelerometer. Instrumentation elevations are presented in Table 1.

It was constructed using a temporary casing method and sea water as the drilling fluid. The 1.22 m O.D. steel casing (1 cm wall thickness) was installed to elevation -18.96 m using a vibratory hammer. The concrete was placed using a tremie method, then the casing tip was pulled to elevation -0.9 m, using a vibratory hammer. A soil boring performed at the test shaft location indicated that the natural ground elevation was approximately 1.5 m. The water table was reported to exist at elevation 0.3 m. SPT testing was initiated at the ground surface (elevation +3 m) and extended to elevation - Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208.

The upper two meters of soil consisted of compacted limestone fill with SPT \"N\" values ranging from 16 to 27. The following strata was reported as fine sand with fragments of limestone and shell. This strata extended to elevation -14.7 m, \"N\" values ranged from 9 to 57. From elevation - 14.7 m throughout, the rock socket length averaged 34% RQD at 80% recovery. RQD values ranged from 18% to 73% in the limestone below the shaft tip. Recovery values in this strata were generally greater than 70%. Figure 5 shows the measured change in strain with respect to time t = 0 for each gage level. Figures 6 through 8 illustrate the motion parameters determined for each of the five segments. Figure 9 shows the forces calculated at each gage level with the true measured strain. Figure 10 shows the dynamic forces on each of the segments as calculated by Equation 11. Figure 5. Strain versus Time Using the segmental forces, the derived static soil resistance is determined for each of the segments. Figure 11 shows a typical segment load versus segment displacement curve. By simply dividing the segment force by circumferential surface area this curve can be converted in to a shear stress versus displacement (T-Z) curve for that specific soil strata. It can be seen in Figure 10 that the peak of each segment force may occur at different times and therefore at different top-of-pile displacements. This can effect the pile capacity in that the ultimate shear strengths of the strata should not be simply summed. This is most probably not a significant concern with this pile due to the plunging nature of the failure. This is evidenced by the similar top and toe movements shown in Figure 6. However, to be technically correct, SUP uses the summation of segment forces as they were developed. This accounts for upper soil layers that may fully mobilize and become residual in nature while Downloaded 09 Sep 2009 to 131.247.9.208.

Summary A new method of analysis called the Segmental Unloading Point Method (SUP) was presented that evaluates StatnamicaIly loaded foundations as segments whose lengths are defined by embedded strain gage elevations. The recorded strain measurements are used to determine both the segmental motion parameters as well as the segmental force traces. Each segment is then treated as an individual foundation whose static response is derived using either the UP or MUP methods. The summation of each segment contribution with respect to time provides a top of foundation response that more closely incorporates the actual distribution of inertial and damping forces throughout the foundation. This is most important in the analysis of relatively long or fixed-ended piles. Although the UP and MUP methods of analysis are sufficient for most loading conditions, SUP provides information for soil strata T-Z curves as well as cut-off elevation load-displacement curves.
