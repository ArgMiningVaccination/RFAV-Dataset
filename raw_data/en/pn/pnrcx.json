What is the cost effectiveness of stereotactic a blative body radiotherapy for prostate cancer which is considered not suitable fo r surgery (because of medical co-morbidity or because lesion is inoperable), comp ared to best standard care? Summary Background Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a targeted mode of radiation therapy. It can be used to treat carcinoma of the p rostate, but there is uncertainty about the clinical and cost effectiveness of this a pproach. Clinical effectiveness We found no randomised controlled trials. We found one systematic review: o The authors found no controlled trials of the effe ctiveness of SABR for prostate cancer. o They included 14 uncontrolled studies which report ed a total of 1472 participants. Biochemical progression-free survival was more than 81% in all the studies, after median follow-up of 11 to 60 mon ths. o The systematic review reported that the commonest form of acute toxicity was urinary, with grade 1 (least severe) adverse ef fects reported in 20% to 74% of participants. Grade 1 acute rectal toxicity occurred in 3% to 75% of participants. o The review included four studies reporting quality of life, three uncontrolled and one controlled. Of the three which were uncontr olled, two reported that quality of life declined in the first few months af ter SABR but then returned to baseline levels, and one reported no overall cha nges. o The fourth study compared radical prostatectomy wi th SABR. It reported that the men who had SABR had smaller and briefer d eclines in quality of life related to urinary symptoms, and avoided the l oss of sexual quality of life that followed prostatectomy. There was a larger and more prolonged decline in bowel quality of life after SABR than after surg ery. This study is unreliable because of marked confounding between the two group s. 2 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT We found one controlled study reporting oncologica l outcomes published since the search date of the systematic review. It compared S ABR with or without external beam radiotherapy in men with high-risk non-metasta tic prostate carcinoma, and reported that five-year biochemical disease-free su rvival was 68% overall, which was similar in the two groups. However, these resul ts are of doubtful validity. We found thirteen uncontrolled studies not include d in the systematic review. We excluded studies with fewer than a hundred particip ants; including these small uncontrolled studies would have not provided any fu rther information on the effectiveness of SABR relative to other treatments. This left one study, which reported seven-year bio chemical disease-free survival of 94% and overall survival of 85%. A safety study published since the systematic revi ew indicates that SABR leads to more genito-urinary and gastro-intestinal adverse e ffects than intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Cost effectiveness We found three analyses from the United States whi ch concluded that the lower costs of SABR lead to better apparent cost effectiv eness than IMRT. However, the analyses have a number of limitations which restric t their relevance and reliability. Activity and cost No cost or activity data were available. Equity issues We identified no specific equity issues. 1 Context 1.1 Introduction Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a targeted mode of radiation therapy. It can be used to treat prostate cancer, b ut there is uncertainty about the clinical and cost effectiveness of this approach. 1.2 Existing national policies and guidance We found no national policies or guidance based on systematic reviews of the evidence. SABR is not mentioned in NICE's guidance on the management of prostate cancer. 3 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT 2 Epidemiology Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer among Briti sh males. It affects about one in twelve men over a lifetime, giving rise each year to about 30,000 new cases and 10,000 deaths. Prostate cancer is particularly common among older men; two- thirds of those who die from prostate cancer are ov er the age of 75 years. Prostate cancer may be diagnosed when men are investigated f or benign prostate disease, also a common condition in elderly men. The disease varies widely in its clinical course, t ending to be more aggressive in younger men. Sometimes prostate cancers grow so slo wly that they pose no threat to health or longevity - autopsies in men over eigh ty years of age show that most have malignant tissue in their prostate glands, but they died with prostate cancer, not of it. Survival rates are better than for many other cancers. External beam radiotherapy is widely used to treat prostate cancer. Compared with external beam radiotherapy, SABR offers the potenti al advantages of delivering a higher dose to the tumour with less collateral dama ge to normal tissue, and of requiring fewer fractions. 3 The intervention Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) is a targeted mode of radiation therapy. It involves the use of radiation delivered from numerous angles so that only a small volume of tissue is exposed to the ful l dose. It can be delivered either as a single dose or in up to five fractions. It is an alternative to surgery or other forms of radiotherapy, especially in patients who c annot undergo surgery and for tumours that are hard to reach, located close to vi tal structures or subject to movement within the body. 4 Findings In March 2015, we searched for evidence about the c linical and cost effectiveness of SABR for the treatment of prostate cancer. The q uestion for this review concerned only men unsuitable for surgery, but we f ound few studies which applied this inclusion criterion. We have therefore included other studies to provide a more comprehensive report. The search strategy is in the Appendix. 4.1 Evidence of effectiveness We found no randomised controlled trials. We found one systematic review: 4 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT Tan et al reviewed studies of the effectiveness of SABR for prostate cancer (search date January 2014).[1] They excluded studie s with fewer than ten participants or less than six months' median follow -up. They only included studies in which SABR was the sole form of radiothe rapy used, in order to avoid the confounding effects of other radiation tr eatment. When an institution had several publications, only the most relevant wa s used, with care taken to prevent the inclusion of overlapping cohorts. All t he participants were newly diagnosed and apparently without metastases. Tan et al found no controlled studies reporting onc ological outcomes. They included 14 uncontrolled studies which reported a t otal of 1472 participants. Ten of the studies specified the use of androgen de privation therapy, which may have influenced the outcomes independently of S ABR. Tan et al did not meta-analyse their results, but reported that bioch emical progression-free survival was more than 81% in all the studies, afte r median follow-up ranging from 11 to 60 months. Tan et al included four studies reporting quality o f life, three uncontrolled and one controlled: o Of the three which were uncontrolled, two reported that quality of life declined in the first few months after treatment bu t then returned to baseline levels,[2][3] and one reported no overall changes[4]. o The fourth study, by Katz et al, was a retrospecti ve comparison of quality of life between surgery and SABR (Table 1).[5] The authors compared men who had undergone radical prostatectomy at ten Spanish hospitals with another group who had SABR at a hospital in Ne w York. They reported that the men who had SABR had smaller and briefer declines in quality of life related to urinary symptoms, and av oided the loss of sexual quality of life that followed prostatectomy. There was a larger and more prolonged decline in bowel quality of life after SA BR. Katz et al's study is unreliable. The two groups we re too dissimilar for a comparison between them to be valid. The men who re ceived SABR were older, had lower prostate-specific antigen lev els, lower Gleason scores (a measure of tumour grade), earlier stage, lower risk tumours and smaller prostates. The quality of life of the t wo groups differed significantly at baseline, and the men who received SABR were also more likely to use sildenafil for erectile dysfunct ion. These important differences, rather than the effects of the treatme nts, may well explain the reported results. There may also be cultural or linguistic factors co nfounding this research. The use of a questionnaire in a different language and continent may give rise to spurious differences in response that would not appear in a single homogenous group of responde nts. 5 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT We found one controlled study reporting oncological outcomes published since Tan et al's search date of January 2012 (Table 1).[ 6] Katz and Kang compared SABR with or without external beam radiotherapy in men with high-risk non- metastatic prostate carcinoma, and reported that fi ve-year biochemical disease- free survival was 68% overall, and dd not differ si gnificantly between the two groups. This study may suggest that SABR alone is as effect ive SABR plus external beam radiotherapy, but needs to be interpreted with caut ion. It is of limited relevance and validity: The results of using SABR plus external beam radio therapy lie outside the scope of this review. The first question to address is whether SABR should be used at all. The study was not randomised, and may be biased. K atz and Kang do not report how men were allocated to treatment. The two groups differed in potentially important ways. Most significantly, men who received only SABR had lower baseline prostate-specific antigen levels , suggesting their disease was less advanced. The authors attempted to adjust for this in their multivariate analysis, but treated the variable as dichotomous n ot continuous, a potentially less effective approach. The authors do not report a power calculation. The ir analysis may have lacked statistical power and produced a false negative res ult. We found one controlled study of treatment toxicity published since January 2012.[7] It is summarised in section 4.4 below. We found no other controlled studies. We found thirteen uncontrolled studies not included in Tan et al's systematic review. We excluded studies with fewer than a hundr ed participants; including these small uncontrolled studies would have not pro vided any further information on the effectiveness of SABR relative to other trea tments. This left three studies for inclusion, one of treatment efficacy (Table 1) [8] and two toxicity studies summarised below in section 4.4 [9][10]. Katz and Kang reported results from 477 men treate d at a hospital in New York.[8] Earlier results from this cohort were incl uded in Tan et al's review. Katz and Kang reported seven-year actuarial biochemical disease-free survival of 93.7% and overall survival of 85%. 4.2 Trials in progress We searched clinicaltrials.gov and found five studi es randomising men between SABR and other treatments: 6 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT The Prostate Advances in Comparative Evidence (PAC E) trial is based in the UK. Men for whom surgery is feasible are randomised to either prostatectomy or prostate SABR; other men are randomised to eithe r conventionally fractionated radiation therapy or prostate SABR (NC T01584258). This trial is recruiting now. A comparison of conventional radiotherapy with ste reotactic irradiation plus hyaluronic acid injection in the space between the prostate and the rectum to preserve the rectal wall from high doses of irradia tion (NCT02361515). This trial is not yet open for recruitment. A comparison of SABR and IMRT in Hong Kong, now re cruiting (NCT02339701) The Miami BLaStM Trial, which compares a form of s tereotactic radiotherapy with more conventional radiotherapy (NCT02307058). This trial is now recruiting. A trial of conventional IMRT versus SABR (NCT01794 403), now recruiting in the United States. 7 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT Table 1: Studies of SABR for prostate cancer Study Patients Intervention Comparator Outcomes Com ments Katz et al [5] 10 Spanish hospitals and one in Mineola, United States Men receiving SABR had T1c or T2b prostate cancer and were treated at Mineola. Men receiving surgery had T1 or T2* prostate cancer, no previous transurethral resection and no hormonal therapy, and were treated at one of 10 hospitals in Spain. SABR 35 or 36.25 Gy in 5 daily fractions, n = 216. Median age 69 years Radical retropubic prostatectomy, with nerve-sparing** at the surgeon's discretion, n = 123. Median age 65 years At baseline Urinary quality of life (QoL***): SABR 89.3, surgery QoL: SABR 95.5, surgery 96.4, P < 0.14. After treatment, measured at 3 weeks, 5, 11, 24 and 36 months (SABR) and 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months (surgery) (exact data not reported): Urinary QOL: SABR: declined significantly at 3 weeks but at 5 months and thereafter was similar to baseline; surgery: declined significantly at 1 month, with only partial recovery thereafter. Sexual QoL: SABR: stable throughout; surgery: significant decline at 1 month with partial recovery thereafter, but significantly below baseline throughout. Severe confounding: men receiving SABR were older (P < 0.0001), had lower prostate-specific antigen levels (P < 0.0001), lower Gleason scores (P = 0.005), earlier stage (P < 0.0001), lower risk (P < 0.0001) and had smaller prostates (P = 0.005). They were also more likely to use sildenafil to for erectile dysfunction.

All other toxicities: no significant differences. The study is subject to potential confounding. However, this would most likely have biased it in favour of IMRT, as IMRT patients were more likely to have androgen-deprivation therapy and therefore probably had higher risk disease. Some lower 95% confidence intervals are close to 1 with significant P- values, because of the large size of this study. * T1 tumours are too small to be seen on scans or f elt during examination of the prostate. They are di agnosed by needle biopsy, after finding a raised prostate-spec ific antigen level.

Costs were based on the US health care system in 2010. IMRT cost $29,530 (\u00a319.400) and SABR $14,315 (\u00a39400 ). It followed from these assumptions that the lower c ost of IMRT yielded a lower cost Hodges et al varied th eir assumptions using sensitivity analysis, but SABR had an incremental c ost effectiveness ratio of less than $50,000 in 66% of iterations. The senior author of this paper had received resear ch funding from Accuray Incorporated, a manufacturer of stereotactic radiot herapy equipment. Sher et al's approach was similar to that of Hodge s et al.[12] They derived their estimates of treatment efficacy and toxicity from p ublished sources; it is not clear how they reconciled disparate results. Costs were from the 2012 Medicare tariff. The base case analysis indicated t hat IMRT yielded slightly more QALYs than SABR, but was also more expensive, with costs per QALY of $3,400 (\u00a32200), compared Sensitivity analysis under most sets of parameter assumpt ions. Parthan et al also published a similar analysis, w hich also included proton beam therapy.[13] They based their assumptions abou t treatment efficacy on uncontrolled studies, which they meta-analysed with out assessing heterogeneity. Costs were based on the US Medicare tariff. Like Hodges et al, Parthan et al concluded that SAB R was the most cost effective treatment, with a cost per QALY of $3100 (\u00a32000). IMRT and proton beam therapy versus SABR of $8195 (\u00a35400) and $46,560 (\u00a330,600). than 75% and 94% of simulations respectively. Parthan et al is affected by a serious conflict of interest. The analysis was paid for by Accuray and one of the authors, responsible for part of the modelling, was an employee of the company. These studies reach similar conclusions: that the l ower costs of SABR (related to the lower number of fractions) lead to it to have b etter apparent cost effectiveness that IMRT. However, the analyses have a number of l imitations: They are based on US healthcare costs, which diffe r significantly from those in the NHS. It is not clear how the extra capital costs of SAB R equipment is modelled. All the studies assume that the payment under Medic are equals the true cost to the health care system of each treatment ap proach, rather than establishing the cost by bottom-up addition. The data on efficacy and toxicity come from uncont rolled studies. If men in the various studies differed in ways that influence d the probabilities of these events, then the studies' results cannot be validly compared, and the cost effectiveness analyses are unreliable. The analyses only compare SABR with other forms of radiotherapy. Early prostate cancer can also be treated with surgery, h ormonal treatment and active monitoring, and these may be more cost effec tive than any form of radiotherapy. Not all baseline assumptions were compatible with, Yu et al's large and reliable analysis of the adverse effects of SABR an d IMRT.[7] Some studies are affected by conflicts of interest . 4.4 Safety Adverse urinary effects of SABR include urinary retention, haematuria and urethral stricture. Recta l adverse effects include urgency and/or frequency of defecation and rectal bleeding. Tan et al's systematic review reported toxicity re sults from the 12 studies which included data on adverse effects of treatment, from a total of 921 participants.[1] The commonest form of acute toxici ty was urinary, with grade 1 (least severe) adverse effects reported in 20% to 7 4% of participants. Grade 2 toxicity occurred in 5% to 42%; only three studies reported grade 3 toxicity, in a total of five (0.5%) of participants. There were no grade 4 or 5 events reported. Grade 1 acute rectal toxicity occurred in 3% to 75% of participants and grade 2 in 0% to 27%; there were no reports of more severe acute rectal toxicity. All 14 studies reported late toxicity, in 1100 part icipants. Grade 1 late urinary toxicity was reported in 0% to 44% of participants, and grade 2 in 0% to 29%. There were 14 participants with grade 3 toxicity (1 .2%). Again, there were no grade 4 or 5 events reported. Late grade 1 rectal toxicity rates ranged from 0% t o 35%, and grade 2 from 0% to 11%. Three participants suffered grade 3 late re ctal toxicity and two grade 4 toxicity. Yu et al's study was published after Tan et al's s earch date (Table 1).[7] They used a comprehensive database of Medicare claims to compare adverse effects after SABR and intensity-modulated radiothe rapy (IMRT). They identified men with early-stage prostate cancer age d 66 to 94 years who received one of these forms of radiotherapy as prim ary treatment. The study was large, including 53,841 men who had I MRT and 1335 who had SABR. The groups were dissimilar: SABR patients wer e younger, healthier, from higher income areas and less likely to have an drogen-deprivation therapy, possibly indicating less aggressive disease. To red uce the consequent confounding effects, Yu et al matched each SABR pat ient with two IMRT patients for age, ethnicity, metropolitan residence , comorbidity, receipt of androgen-deprivation therapy, influenza vaccination (a marker of access to primary care), previous visit to a primary care pro vider and income. The analysis was confined to Medicare claims related to treatment toxicity. SABR was associated with more genito-urinary toxici ty than IMRT at six, twelve and twenty-four months after treatment (Table 1). A fter two years, 44% of men who had had SABR had made a claim indicative of gen ito-urinary toxicity, compared with 36% of IMRT patients. Most of the ext ra toxicity from SABR was from the urethra and bladder, with a higher inciden ce of claims for diagnostic procedures for urinary incontinence and obstruction , and for the treatment of urethritis, urethral stricture and obstruction. Gastro-intestinal toxicity was also more common aft er SABR than after IMRT in the first six months, though no specific pattern of toxicity was evident. Arscott et al, also published since January 2014, reported an uncontrolled study of urinary obstruction after SABR for prostate canc er.[9] They found that obstructive voiding symptoms became more common at one month after treatment, but rates usually returned to pre-treatm ent levels within three months. Seven percent of the 269 men studied felt t hat weak urinary stream and/or incomplete emptying was still a problem two years after treatment. Bhattasali et al, also published since January 201 4, reported that urinary and bowel symptoms became more common in the first mont h after SABR in the 228 men studied.[10] There was a further and more p rolonged period of symptoms between nine and eighteen months, with a p artial recovery by two years. 4.5 Summary of section 4 We found no randomised trials of SABR for prostate cancer, though several are in progress. We found only one unrandomised controlled study of the efficacy of SABR.[6] Because of the use of SABR in both arms of the tria l, a potentially ineffective approach to adjustment for confounders and possible lack of power, this study is of limited value. There are many uncontrolled studies which indicate the prognosis of men with prostate cancer treated with SABR, but shed no ligh t on its performance relative to other treatments. A large and well-controlled study reported that SAB R was associated with more genito-urinary and gastro-intestinal adverse effect s than IMRT.[7] Uncontrolled studies also indicate that SABR reduces quality of life with gradual, and in some cases only partial, recovery. Health economic analyses from the United States ind icate that SABR is less expensive than IMRT. If it is also equally effectiv e and no more toxic, it is therefore more cost effective than IMRT. However, these analy ses have a number of limitations that restrict their relevance and relia bility. 5 Cost and activity No cost or activity data were available. 6 Equity issues We identified no specific equity issues. 7 Discussion and conclusions We found little evidence specific to men unsuitable for surgery. More generally, there is evidence from uncontrolled studies indicating that SABR is a feasible and acceptable treatment for prostate ca ncer. It can be delivered over fewer fractions than IMRT, which makes it more conv enient for patients. The absence of reliable, appropriately controlled s tudies makes it impossible to assess the effectiveness of SABR versus other treat ments. The adverse effects of SABR have an immediate and i n some cases sustained effect on quality of life; these appear to be more common than after IMRT. The cost of SABR depends on the price of equipment and rates of use and of depreciation. There are apparent savings from the r educed number of treatment sessions, but the studies from the United States wh ich indicate that SABR is more cost effective than IMRT are of questionable reliab ility and relevance to the NHS. Several randomised trials of SABR versus IMRT are i n progress. This indicates the current clinical uncertainty about SABR's value and also suggests that policy- making will rest on more secure foundations once th e results of these trials are available. 1. What is the clinical effectiveness of stereotact ic ablative body radiotherapy for prostate cancer which is considered not suitable fo r surgery (because of medical co-morbidity or because lesion is inoperable), comp ared to best standard care? We found little evidence specific to men unsuitable for surgery. More generally, there is evidence from uncontrolled studies indicating that SABR is feasible and more convenient than IMRT. There is no reliable evidence that it is more effective, and reason to believe it produces m ore adverse effects. Randomised trials now recruiting are likely to redu ce the uncertainty about SABR's performance relative to IMRT in treating prostate c ancer. 2. What is the cost effectiveness of stereotactic a blative body radiotherapy for prostate cancer which is considered not suitable fo r surgery (because of medical co-morbidity or because lesion is inoperable), comp ared to best standard care? We found little evidence specific to men unsuitable for surgery. More generally, if one is willing to assume that SA BR is less expensive than IMRT, equally effective and no more toxic, then it is mor e cost effective than IMRT. However, none of these assumptions can be accepted confidently on the basis of the evidence that we found. 8 Search Strategy (search date March 2015) Population Intervention Comparator Outcomes Studies 1.
