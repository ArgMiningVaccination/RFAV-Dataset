Leir Professor of International Humanitarian Studies and Academi c Dean The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University ABSTRACT : This dissertation seeks to contribute to both the theory and practice of reconciliation by offering a theoretical framework for reconciliation that can be used by scholars to test the effects of various interventions designed to promote reconciliation, and by implementing t he first randomized field experiment to test the effects of facilitated intergroup contact in a pos t-conflict society. In Aceh, Indonesia, 108 ex-combatants and persons affected by conflict participated in one of six three-day workshops or in a control group to assess the effects of dialogue-based, training-based and mixed-method conflict resolution techniques on prejudice, empathy, trust , tolerance, forgiveness and healing, which served as proxies for reconciliation. While t he results of this study are modest, they provide the first empirical evidence that intergroup contac t programs can reduce prejudice, and increase trust, forgiveness and healing in the highly charged context of post-conflict societies, suggesting that contact programs may over time become an effective means of encouraging reconciliation in conflict-affected socie ties.

countries in the world relapsing into violence within ten years, post-conflict peacebuilding remains one of the greatest challenges facing both scholars and practitioners. 1 This dissertation therefore seeks to address the core peacebuilding dilemma of how to prevent a resumption of violence in post-conflict societies by advancing wor k on the concept of reconciliation, which is now recognized as a key piece of the post-confl ict peacebuilding agenda, essential to ensuring an equitable and stable peace, 2 and to the prevention of future conflict.3 However, as no comprehensive theory of reconciliation exists, there has been no c onsensus or conceptual clarity on what reconciliation means and even less on how to achieve it.4 Moreover, a lack of empirical evidence surrounding the efficacy of interventions designed to pr omote reconciliation has left practitioners with little information about how to cre ate the conditions for reconciliation in conflict-affected societies.

Bar-Tal (New York: Psychology Press, 2011) . 2 In the absence of a theory of reconciliation, transitional justice, with i ts primary emphasis on truth-telling mechanisms such as prosecutions and truth commissions, has become the dominant paradigm for promoting reconciliation in post-conflict societies. This is demonst rated by the Peace Accords Matrix (PAM) compiled by the University of Notre Dame' s Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies, which compares data on 29 comprehensive peace agree ments signed since 1989. 5 The database shows that fewer than 40% of peace agreements have included an explicit mechanism for encouraging reconciliation, but 100% of those that did included a truth and reconciliation mechanism that established a temporary and officially sa nctioned body to investigate and report on patterns of human rights abuses. 6 None of these agreements included any other type of program aimed at addressing reconciliation. While the re are numerous examples of initiatives undertaken by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and scholar- practitioners designed to promote reconciliation, none have ever been officia lly sanctioned in a peace agreement or scaled up to develop national reach. 7 Problematically, evidence is emerging demonstrating that while transi tional justice may achieve some of the claims of its proponents such as establishing a historical record, educat ing the public, providing a basis for institutional reform and reparations, and establishing a se nse of 5 A comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) is defined a s a written document produced through a process of negotiation in which the major parties to the confl ict are involved in the negotiations, and substanti ve issues underlying the dispute are included in the negotiat ion process. PAM defines a CPA by the process and p roduct of negotiations, not the implementation or impact of t he document. As such, a comprehensive peace is not necessary for a comprehensive peace agreement to be included in the list.

As such, I do not argue that transitional justice should not be an integral part of post-conflict peac ebuilding, but rather that it should not be the sole focus of practitioners who seek to create the c onditions for reconciliation. This dissertation therefore seeks to identify mechanism s that may be complementary to transitional justice in the pursuit of the psychological changes that embody reconciliation. As such, I turn to the social psychological literature on intergroup relations and int ergroup contact, which for more than 50 years has been indicating that contact between grou ps can produce psychological changes such as a reduction of prejudice, and an increase in em pathy, trust, and forgiveness. 10 8 Jonathan D.

Allport, The Nature of Prejudice (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1954). 4 However, limitations in existing research require additional inquiry to incr ease the body of case studies in non-Western and conflict-affected contexts such that we are better able to understand whether the effects found in previous studies transfer to the highly-charged poli tical context of intergroup contact between social groups with \"a history of conflict and hostilit y, inequalities of status and power, and political struggle.\" 11 As such, this dissertation seeks to contribute to both the theory and practice of rec onciliation by first positing a theoretical framework for reconciliation that can be used b y scholars to test the effects of various interventions that may contribute to achieving reconciliati on. This framework proposes that the essence of reconciliation is about improving intergroup relations to the extent that conflict is resolved through dialogue rather than violence, and operationaliz es reconciliation as a combination of psychological changes that may include a reduction of prejudice , and an increase in empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness and healing\u2014variables whi ch scholars have proposed as key elements of reconciliation.12 Conceptualizing reconciliation in this way allows scholars to test the effect of various interventions designed to promote reconc iliation on the psychological changes that indicate reconciliation is taking place. To that end, after positing a theoretical framework for reconciliation, this stud y uses a field experimental methodology to begin to establish empirical evidence about the intervent ions that 11 \" Marilynn B. Brewer and Samuel L. Gaertner, \"T oward Reduction of Prejudice: Intergroup Contact an d Social Categorization,\" in Self and Social Identity , ed. Marilynn B. Brewer and Miles Hewstone (Mald en, MA Blackwell Publishing, 2004), 301. 12 Gibson, Overcoming apartheid: Can truth reconcile a divided nation ; Broun\u00e9us, \"The trauma of truth telling: Effects of witnessing in the Rwandan gacaca courts on psychological health.\"; Jens Meierhenrich, \"Vari eties of Reconciliation,\" Law and Social Inquiry 33, no. 1 (2008); Gordon Allport, The Nature of Prejudice (Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley Publishing Co., 1954); Miles Hew stone et al., \"Stepping stones to reconciliation in Northern Ireland: Intergroup contact, forgiveness and trust, \" in The Social Psychology of Intergroup Reconciliation , ed. Arie Nadler, Thomas Malloy, E., and Jeffrey D. Fisher (O xford: Oxford University Press, 2008). 5 may lead to the psychological changes that embody reconciliation. Specifical ly, I will test the effects intergroup contact on reconciliation by asking the following questions : Q1: Does dialogue-based contact reduce intergroup prejudice in a post-conflict c ontext? Q2: Does dialogue-based contact increase a post-con flict context? Q3: Does dialogue-based contact a post-conflict context? Q4: Does dialogue-based contact increase post-co nflict context? Q5: Does dialogue-based post-c onflict context? Q6: Does dialogue-based contact increase individual a post-conflic t context? I hypothesize that dialogue-based intergroup contact reduces intergroup prejudice, whi le increasing intergroup empathy, trust, tolerance, healing and forgiveness. In answering these questions, this dissertation offers the first case stud y that employs a rigorously-designed randomized field experiment to test the effects of fa cilitated intergroup contact in a non-Western, highly-charged post-conflict society. As will be explained in detail in Chapter 3, 108 ex-combatants and persons affected by conflict in the post-conflict c ontext of Aceh, Indonesia participated in one of six three-day workshops or in a control group tha t did not attend the workshops. In order to determine the optimal conditions for facilitating r econciliation, three distinct treatments were applied: dialogue-based contact workshops, training-based contact workshops, and mixed-method contact workshops that combined both dialogue and training techniques. The effects of the workshops were measured using psychometric sca les for each of the dependent variables--prejudice, empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness a nd healing. I focus on the case of Aceh, Indonesia because while the 2005 peace agreement be tween the Government of Indonesia (GoI) and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) has brought about 6 significant structural and political change, little has been done to address reconciliation in Aceh. This is largely because reconciliation has been conceptualized solely as the implementation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Human Rights Court mandated in the peace agreement, both of which have been delayed indefinitely due to political realities. I n the meantime, relations between the national and provincial governments have improve d, but relations between groups within the province remain tense and in some cases continue to deteriorate, a phenomenon that will be discussed in more detail below. As such, Aceh is a relatively clean slate to work with given the absence of large-scale rec onciliation initiatives to date and offers an ideal situation in which to study the effects of interventions des igned to promote reconciliation. This dissertation begins with an introduction to the context of intergroup relations in Ac eh, in particular in the Central Highlands region of Aceh where this research takes pl ace. Chapter two then examines the literature on reconciliation, transitional justice and interg roup relations in an effort to lay the theoretical foundations that form the backbone of this work and to exam ine the variables that scholars have suggested are key components of reconciliation. Chapte r three discusses the renaissance of field experimentation, particularly for poli tical scientists, and explains the field experimental methodology used in this study. Chapter four presents the findings from the study, while chapter five discusses the implications of these findings for scholars and peacebuilding practitioners. In sum, this applied research argues that while the jury is still out on the effi cacy of transitional justice mechanisms for promoting reconciliation, other constructs are avail able that may prove to be effective alternatives or complements to transitional justice in the pur suit of reconciliation in post-conflict societies. As such, this dissertation seeks to test the effec tiveness of intergroup 7 contact to determine whether it might offer a parallel or complementary a pproach to promoting reconciliation in post-conflict societies. The Case of Aceh, Indonesia On August 15, 2005, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) ending more than 30 years of violent conflic t that claimed over 15,000 lives in Indonesia's northernmost province of Aceh. While by most accounts, the implementation of the MoU is considered a success, many challenges r emain to ensuring Aceh continues down the road to sustainable peace. 13 Among them, lingering and growing tensions between groups within the province pose a significant challenge for efforts aimed at improving intergroup relations and promoting reconciliation. These tensions will be discussed at length below following a brief introduction to the background of the Aceh conflict that will first explain the origins and causes of the se paratist movement, and will then lay out the structural and political changes that have taken place since t he signing of the peace agreement, which have served to significantly improve relations betwe en the national and provincial governments. I will then turn to what is perhaps the most challenging pr oblem facing the peace process today\u2014the deterioration of relations of groups within the province, whic h will highlight the need for initiatives designed to promote reconciliation. While divisions between groups within Aceh can be seen across political, economic and re ligious dimensions at both the provincial and district levels, I will focus on divisions at the poli tical level reflected in the ongoing gubernatorial elections and relations between forme r anti-separatist 13 Edward Aspinall, Islam and Nation: Separatist rebellion in Aceh, Ind onesia (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2009). 8 forces (PETA, Pembela Tanah Air or Defenders of the Homeland ) and former GAM combatants in the Central Highlands region of Aceh as important examples of the myriad tensions that exist between groups in post-conflict Aceh. Background to the Aceh conflict: In 1945, after more than 350 years of colonization by the Dutch, Indonesia, with the help of the Acehnese, declared independence. At the time, Ha san di Tiro and his colleagues who would later found the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), were cal ling for a federated Indonesia with Islam as its base. 14 \"When Aceh agreed to join the newly independent Indonesian state in 1945, it was based on the twin assumptions that Aceh's important contribution to the nationalist struggle against the Dutch would entitle i t to an equal stake in the Republic's future, and that Indonesia would be founded on, and strive to uphold, the principles of Islam.\" 15 In 1949, Indonesia honored this demand for federation and established a separate \"Province of Aceh.\" However, in August 1950, shortly after the Dutch formally transferred sovere ignty to the \"Republic of the United States of Indonesia,\" the government revoked Aceh's sta tus as a province and incorporated it into the province of North Sumatra as part of a national plan tha t reorganized Indonesia into only 10 provinces. 16 Over the next decade, Indonesia would continue to centralize authority with the Javanese government in Jakarta, creating a strong sense of betrayal and resentment on the part of those in Aceh who had fought for independence. 17 14 Isa M.

The global movement for self-determination and decolonization strongly influenc ed GAM's discourse during this period and helped shape the formulation of the conflict as a continuati on of Aceh's historical struggle to repel attempts first by the Dutch and then by the Indonesians to colonize an independent Aceh. 18 As such, GAM claimed that the Dutch annexation of Aceh and the subsequent transfer of power to Indonesia in 1949 was illegal and demanded independence based on the restoration of sovereignty to the independent nation of Aceh, as it was before the Dutch invasion of March 26, 1873. 19 Economic grievances also served as a root cause of the conflict. Aceh is a provi nce rich in natural resources, including agriculture, fishing, rubber, coffee, palm oil and coconut s, as well as manufacturing resources such as cement and fertilizer plants. But perhaps mos t importantly, Aceh is rich in liquefied natural gas (LNG), which was discovered by the Mobil Corporation in 1971 in North Aceh. Mobil subsequently contracted with the Indonesian government for the sole rights to produce the natural gas as well as with the PT Arun company, a joint venture t hat is majority owned by Indonesia's state oil and gas company (Pertamina), to pr ovide natural gas. 20 conditions after Aceh's special foreign exchange ag reement with the national government was terminated and a greater portion of the national budget began to be allocated to Java than to the outer islands.\" Ibid. 18 Hasan di Tiro's writing and speeches frequently re ferred to General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960 on the Granting of Independence to Co lonial Countries and Peoples, as well as General As sembly Resolution 2621 (XXV): Programme of Action for the Full Implementation of the Declaration on the Grant ing of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples. \"Th e Acehnese felt they were legally entitled to be an independent state as they had never been legally colonized.\" Da mien Kingsbury and Lesley McCulloch, \"Military Busi ness in Aceh,\" in Verandah of Violence: The Background to the Aceh Pr oblem , ed.

From 1989-1998, the G oI placed Aceh under DOM ( Daerah Operasi Militer ), a period of intensified military operations during which \"widespread and systematic abuses including humiliation, torture, kidnapping , rape, disappearances, extra-judicial killings, and collective punishment\" took place. 24 These abuses were compounded by road-side extortion, theft and the destruction of property by the mi litary and police forces, which served to alienate the population. In addition to these historical, political, economic and human rights grievances, a se ries of dramatic events served as catalysts for the increasing momentum that per petuated the Aceh conflict from 1998-2005. In 1998, President Soeharto, Indonesia's military dictator of 30 years, was deposed, paving the way for the Reformasi , or period of democratic reform throughout 21 District of Columbia Circuit United States Court o f Appeals, \"DOE v.

Ultimately, Wahid was forced to renege on this offer under pressure from the central government and the military, both of whom were unsettled by GAM's growing populari ty and increasing control of the province and responded by increasing military oper ations. As the violence between GAM and the military intensified amidst a crack-down on civi l society activists, the conflict became more entrenched. 25 Ibid., 259. 26 Ibid., 237. 27 In June 1999, a national newspaper reported that 5 6 per cent of Acehnese wanted a referendum on indep endence, while 25.3 per cent preferred broad autonomy within the Indonesian Republic. Miller, \"What's Special A bout Special Autonomy in Aceh?,\" 299. Luas,\" Waspada 1999. 12 In 2000, negotiations under the auspices of the Henri Dunant Centre (HDC) began between GAM and the GOI. The process produced a Humanitarian Pause in 2000, followed by a Cessation of Hostilities Agreement (CoHA) in December 2002. However, the se curity situation continued to worsen throughout the first half of 2003 until the government unilaterally pulled out of negotiations at a meeting in Tokyo in May 2003 and declared martial law in the province . The period of martial law, which was officially downgraded in September 2005 with no eff ective change in the security situation, accompanied an unprecedented rise in violence, displ acement and human rights abuses, furthering Acehnese grievances against the state. Following the collapse of the CoHA, in the midst of escalating violence, a seri es of pre- negotiations took place between GAM and the central government. However, it was t he December 26, 2005 Indian Ocean tsunami, which claimed the lives of approximately 200,000 people in Aceh and displaced nearly half a million, that finally brought the partie s to the negotiating table. 28 On January 27, 2006, formal talks were opened in Helsinki, Finland mediated by former Finnish President Maarti Ahtisaari under the auspices of his non-gov ernmental organization, the Crisis Management Initiative (CMI). The talks were quie tly supported by the European Union and over the next eight months, five rounds of talks produced the August 15, 28 The GoI had previously agreed to attend negotiatio ns in Helsinki, but it was not until after the tsun ami that GAM agreed to attend the negotiations. In interviews wi th the author in 2006, GAM representatives cited th e following reasons the tsunami led them to the negotiating tab le: 1. the extent of suffering in Aceh was so great that GAM found it morally unconscionable to impose further s uffering through violence; 2. GAM lost its logistic base due to the economic losses imposed on the civilian populat ion; 3. the physical presence of the international community on the ground in Aceh and their stated commitment to r emain in Aceh to support the long-term reconstructi on effort gave GAM confidence that the international communit y was serious about peace in Aceh and could apply significant pressure to Indonesia to uphold the pea ce and 4. the international community was pressurin g both GAM and the GoI to reach a peaceful settlement by threa tening to withhold reconstruction funds if the viol ence continued and GAM recognized the importance of securing this aid. Rachel Schiller, \"The factors that lead to th e signing of peace agreements: The case of Aceh, Indo nesia,\" in Unpublished Master's Thesis (The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University, 2007). 13 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between GAM and the GoI that has to date formed the backbone of the Aceh peace process. 29 The MoU provides a framework for self-government in Aceh within the unitary stat e and constitution of the Republic of Indonesia. It gives Aceh the right to govern all sectors of public affairs with the exception of foreign affairs, external defense, national se curity, monetary and fiscal matters, and justice and freedom of religion. It calls for the withdra wal of 'non-organic' Indonesian military and police forces from Aceh and for the demobilization and di sarmament of GAM. 30 It also grants Aceh the right to establish local political parties that can contest elections in the province, calls for gubernatorial and parliamentary elections in 2006 and 2009 respectively, grants Aceh 70 percent of oil and gas revenues, grants amnesty to all persons who have participated in GAM activities, provides for reparations to be paid by the centr al government, calls for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commissi on (TRC) and a Human Rights Court, as well as an Aceh Monitoring Mission (AMM), which ultimate ly was led by the European Union with participation from Norway, Switzerland and five c ontributing ASEAN countries (Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, Philippines and Singapore) and was p resent in Aceh until its withdrawal on December 15, 2006. Intergroup relations in Aceh: Six years into the implementation of the MoU, the peace process has brought about significant political and economic change in Aceh. How ever, much remains to be done to achieve sustainable peace. As in many post-conflict societi es, the post- conflict peacebuilding agenda has consisted mainly of trying to rectify polit ical and economic grievances by focusing on implementation of the political and economic provisions of the 29 \"Memorandum of Understanding Between the Governmen t of the Republic of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement,\" in http://www.aceh-mm.org/download/english/Helsinki%20 MoU.pdf (August 15, 2005). 30 Non-organic refers to all troops that are not regu larly based in Aceh. 14 MoU.31 However, initiatives focusing on intergroup reconciliation have been few and far between, and while relations between central and provincial actors have improved, r elations between groups within the province remain tense. To be sure, many structural changes have been made, which have served to increase tr ust between Jakarta and Aceh. National legislation on Aceh's self-government\u2014The Law on the Governing of Aceh (LoGA)\u2014was passed and elections for the Governor's seat as we ll as parliamentary seats were held, bringing to power an ex-combatant Governor and a provincial parliament in which representatives of GAM's political party, Partai Ac eh (PA), hold 33 of the 69 seats.32 The Aceh Reintegration Board (BRA) was established to administer reparat ion and compensation payments to former combatants, amnestied political prisoners and civi lians affected by conflict, the central government transferred funds to the Aceh adm inistration for oil and gas profits, and numerous economic development programs have been launched in the province. However, tensions between various groups within the province remain high. For example, political splits have occurred within GAM itself, as various factions have emer ged and expressed dissatisfaction with the leadership for issues such as the distribution of wealt h that stems largely from provision of government contracts and is seen as predominantly benefiting the top commanders and elite politicians, as well as a sense of political disenfranc hisement as former GAM leaders have consolidated power in political roles. Nowhere are these inter nal divisions better evidenced than in the ongoing round of gubernatorial elections in which the gov ernor, 31 Huyse notes that reconciliation is often postponed in post-conflict societies as it is only one of th e many challenges countries face. As post-conflict societi es are forced to direct their efforts in several di rections at once, insufficient attention is often allocated to the bu ilding of coexistence, trust and empathy. Past expe rience shows that this has often led to politics and economics being put first, at the expense of reconciliation program s. Huyse, \"The Process of Reconciliation,\" 27. 32 While SIRA's candidate became the Vice Governor, S IRA did not win any seats in the provincial parliam ent. 15 Irwandi Yusuf, himself an ex-combatant who was backed by GAM to run for office in 2006, now finds himself running in opposition to PA's candidates of choice--GAM's former fo reign minister who served from exile in Sweden, Zaini Abdullah, and GAM's former milit ary commander, Muzakkir Manaf. Far from being an indication that Aceh is democrati zing, the split has been plagued by violence and intimidation and threatens to jeopardize the peace proce ss. The election was originally scheduled to take place in October 2011, but was delayed four t imes amidst controversy raised by PA over whether it was illegal for Irwandi to run a s an independent candidate for the second time after the peace agreement. 33 With PA boycotting the election, Indonesia's Constitutional Court found it legal for the governor to run as an independent candidate. Following diplomatic intervention from Indonesia's Home Ministry, w hich negotiated an extension of the registration period with Aceh's Independent Election Commis sion (KIP) to prevent a breakdown of the peace process, PA agreed to participate in the electi on, which is now scheduled to take place on April 9, 2012.34 Moreover, this election cycle has not been without serious violence. Since December 2011, acts of pre-election terror have left 10 peopl e dead and 13 injured. 35 While intergroup tensions at the political level often overshadow tensions at the district level, several districts also remain hotbeds of intergroup tension. Chief among them ar e two of the districts that make up the Central Highlands region of Aceh, Aceh Tengah and Be ner Meriah, 33 The election was first delayed to 14 November, the n to 24 December, then to 16 February and finally t o 9 April, 2012. 34 Kartika Candra and Adi Warsidi, \"A heated grapple for power,\" Tempo January 18, 2012. 35 \"Pre-election Terror,\" Tempo January 18, 2012. 16 where relations between former anti-separatist forces (PETA) and for mer GAM combatants remain strained, and have led to infrequent, yet serious outbursts of violence (see m ap below).36 36 Map from ICG, \"Indonesia: Averting Election Violen ce in Aceh,\" in Asia Program Briefing (Jakarta/Brussels: International Crisis Group, February 29, 2012), 10. 17 18 PETA, believed by many to be militia groups organized by Indonesia's military to oppose GAM forces during the conflict, are headquartered in this region. 37 Its membership is largely drawn from migrants of Javanese ethnicity who moved to the province in the late 20 th century or were transmigrated by the government of Indonesia in the 1960's and 1970's to relieve population pressures in Java. Membership in GAM and PETA does not entirely break down along ethni c lines due to the swing votes of the native Gayo population, some of whom are pro-PETA nationalists, some who are pro-GAM and others who remain neutral. However the major ity of GAM members are ethnically Acehnese and hail from the coastal regions of t he province, while members of PETA are largely of Javanese decent and migrated to the Centra l Highlands from the island of Java. The politics of this region are extremely contentious, as the Indonesian gove rnment denies the existence of militias that were trained and armed by the Indonesian mil itary. However, they do acknowledge the existence of self-defense forces that were formed by vill agers to protect themselves against attacks by GAM. As such, both sides are willing to ac knowledge the presence of these forces when they are referred to as PETA, or self-defense force s. However, they are not mentioned in the MoU, nor were they ever demobilized or disarmed. Despite this, the centr al government has provided funds for reparations to the group. One of the key issues between the respective supporters of GAM and PETA is a moveme nt that began during the conflict, but gained steam following the signing of the peace agree ment to separate Aceh into three provinces: the current capital and northern coastal are as; the Central 37 Kirsten E. Schulze, The Free Aceh Movement (GAM): Anatomy of a separati st organization , Policy Studies 2 (Washington, D.C.: East-West Center, 2004), 43. 19 Highlands region, which would be known as ALA (Aceh Leuser Antara); and the south weste rn region of Aceh, which would be called ABAS (Aceh Barat Selatan). 38 Those who advocate the formation of these new provinces largely align with PETA and cite underdevelopm ent and marginalization of the Central Highlands and Southwest regions by the Ace hnese-dominated provincial government, which they believe would be alleviated by controlling thei r own resources and funds. Opponents of the movement, who largely identify with GAM, claim this pemekaran, or splitting, of Aceh is a ploy by Jakarta to dilute the significance of Aceh's s elf- government that will not in fact address the development challenges of these dist ricts. Since the President of Indonesia declared a national moratorium on further pemekaran in 2010, tension over the issue has somewhat receded, but the issue remains a source of contention between supporters of GAM and PETA. This tension in intergroup relations throughout Aceh can be seen in data on social cohesion that emerged following the signing of the MoU. For example, a joint assessment conduc ted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in 2006 showed that levels of inter-ethnic trust in Aceh were low, wit h 43.5% of respondents indicating they did not trust people from other ethnic groups. 39 While the data was not broken down by district, the level of trust held toward other ethnic groups was lowe st among the majority ethnic Acehnese population (25.8%) and highest among the minority Java nese (53.7%). 38 Stefan Ehrentraut, \"Dividing Aceh? Minorities, par tition movements and state-reform in Aceh province, \" in Asia Research Institute Working Paper No. 137 (http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_i d=1716587: Asia Research Institute, May 1, 2010); Stephan Kitzbichl er, \"Pemekaran in Aceh: A way to development, or to conflict?,\" in Aceh Development International Conference 2011 (UKM-Bangi-Malaysia: http://www.acehpublication.com/adic2011/ADIC2011-13 2.pdf, March 26-28, 2011). 39 IOM, \"Meta analysis vulnerability, stability, disp lacement and reintegration: Issues facing the peace process in Aceh, Indonesia,\" (http://reliefweb.int/node/313442 : International Organization for Migration, August 2008), Annex C, 174. 20 Data from the Psychosocial Needs Assessments (PNA) conducted in 2006 and 2007 by the Harvard Medical School in partnership with the University of Syiah Kuala with s upport from IOM and the World Bank also show that just under 15% of the population in Aceh felt a need for revenge. 40 The districts of Aceh Utara had above average percentages of the population who reported they f elt this way. 14.6% of the population also reported they felt others were hostile toward the m, with Aceh Utara (40.6%), Bireuen (24.2%) and Benar Meriah (19.3%) again ranking above avera ge. The data also highlight tensions in the Central Highlands. For example, data from the P NA show that 19.9 percent of respondents in Bener Meriah and 8.9 percent in Aceh Tengah reported that they always feel a lack of trust in others, a response rate higher than any other district and much higher than the provincial average of 5.3 percent. 41 Tension in the Central Highlands can also be seen in the Aceh Reintegration and Livelihoods Surveys (ARLS) conducted by the World Bank between July and September 2008, which indicate that social cohesion in the Central Highlands may be weaker than in other pa rts of the province. 42 For example, a higher percentage of people in the Central Highlands, regardles s of ethnic or identity group, reported differences between their village and neighbori ng villages as well as relations between different ethnic groups to be a source of division. 25% of peopl e in the Central Highlands report relations between their village and neighboring vill ages, and relations between different ethnic groups as a major or minor source of division. This is compa red to 11% 40 Ibid., Annex C, 175. 41 Ibid., Annex C, 174. 42 The ARLS collected livelihood and reintegration da ta on a representative sample of ex-combatants, and a control group of civilian males in 754 villages throughout Aceh. MSR, \"The multistakeholder review of post-con flict programming in Aceh: Identifying the foundations fo r sustainable peace and development in Aceh,\" (https://www.conflictanddevelopment.org/index.php?o ption=com_content&view=article&id=282&Itemid=4&lang = en2009), 106. 21 for all of Aceh, including 9% of the North Coast districts and 7% of the South-western dis tricts and suggests that intergroup divisions in the Central Highlands may be greater than i n other regions of the province. As such, it is evident from both events on the ground as well as dat a that have emerged since the signing of the MoU that reconciliation has not yet been achieved i n Aceh. In the early days following the MoU, indicators such as lack of trust and feelings of revenge in the northern coastal districts of Bireuen, Aceh Utara and Aceh Timur likely reflected tensions over whether the central government would indeed follow through on commitments made in t he MoU. Today, tensions largely reflect political splits that have emerged wi thin GAM itself. In the Central Highlands, such indicators likely reflect tension between ex-comba tants from both GAM and PETA, as the groups continue to vie for political and economic power a midst the reality that PETA was not formally part of the peace process. Absent a concer ted effort to put a process in place to encourage reconciliation, intergroup tensions in the province are likely to per sist. Reconciliation in Aceh: Despite a clear need, reconciliation has been a contentious is sue in Aceh and little progress has been made toward improving intergroup r elations. This is largely 22 because the discourse in Aceh on reconciliation has been shaped by the language of the MoU, which refers solely to reconciliation in Provision 2 on human rights t hat calls for the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and a Human Rights Court for Aceh. Subsequently, reconciliation has to date been viewed as a means of addressing human rights violations committed during the conflict via establishment of the traditional transitional justice mechanisms of the TRC and Human Rights Court.43 However, neither of these instruments has yet come to fruition, nor i s there any indication that this will change in the near future. Progress on establishing the TR C ground to a halt on December 7, 2006 when Indonesia's Constitutional Court (Mahkamah Konstitusi) struck down law No. 27/2004, which established the National Truth and Reconciliation Commission.44 Because Article 229(2) of law No. 11/2006, the Law on the Governing of Ac eh (LoGA), specifies that Aceh's TRC will be established as an \"inseparable part\" of the National TRC, there is currently no legal foundation at the national level for the forma tion of Aceh's TRC. While a new law has been drafted and is scheduled for discussion in Parlia ment in 2011-2014, it was not prioritized for inclusion in the 2012 legislative agenda. Subsequently, discussion about the TRC in Aceh has gravitated toward a focus on whether the government of Aceh should establish a qanun , a provincial law that would create a TRC for Aceh absent a national law. However, as many of the perpetrator s of violence reside outside of 43 Iskandar Zulkarnaen et al., Aceh Timur,\" Seumik\u00e9: Journal of no. 1 (2009); Ross Clarke, Galuh Wandita, and Samsidar, Considering victims: The Aceh peace process from a transitional justice perspective , Occassional Paper Series (Indonesia: Internationa l Center for Transitional possible without truth-telling?).\"; BRA, \"Follow up on the Helsinki peace framework: actio n plan,\" (Banda Aceh, Indonesia: Badan Reintegrasi Aceh, 2009). 44 The court claimed that an article which provided r eparation for victims only after they agreed to an amnesty for the perpetrator was unconstitutional. Amnesty Inter national, \"Indonesia: Victims still waiting for tru th and justice for past human rights violations \" (http://www.amne sty.org/en/library/info/ASA21/012/2012/en: Amnesty International, March 24, 2012). 23 Aceh, many within the provincial government are hesitant to establi sh a TRC without a national umbrella, as it may not have the legal gravitas to require parti cipation from actors in Jakarta. While human rights activists continue to advocate for the establishme nt of the TRC, it may be years before any significant forward movement is made toward its establishment. In the meantime, discourse on reconciliation remains consumed by how to est ablish the TRC and there remains a vacuum of meaningful progress toward reconciliation in Aceh. However, reconciliation need not be stalled by a lack of progress tow ard the TRC and Human Rights Court as a deeper understanding of the meaning of reconcilia tion can lead to other options for its advancement. While an agreed upon definition of reconciliation re mains elusive, I argue that at its core, reconciliation is about improving intergroup relat ions to the extent that differences are resolved through dialogue and negotiation, rather than violence. If we adopt this notion of reconciliation, then the essence of reconciliation becomes about improving intergroup relations, which, from a social psychological lens, can be characte rized as reducing prejudice and increasing attitudes such as empathy, trust and tolerance between individuals a nd groups. As it will likely be years before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and t he Human Rights Court for Aceh become politically viable, it is important that reconciliat ion is not delayed indefinitely. With baseline data already available and a relatively cle an slate to work with given the absence of large-scale reconciliation initiatives to date, Aceh is an ide al situation in which to test alternative methods designed to promote reconciliation. As such, this diss ertation will adopt the case of the Central Highlands region in Aceh to test the effects of intergroup di alogue on reconciliation, as measured by a decrease in prejudice and an increase in var iables such as empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness and healing. 24 This chapter has demonstrated the need for reconciliation initiatives to improve intergroup relations in Aceh. The next chapter will explore the literature on reconcil iation, transitional justice and intergroup relations theory in order to demonstrate the growing body of evidence indicating that intergroup contact initiatives should become an important starting point for promoting reconciliation in Aceh. Chapter three will then explain the methods used to im plement this study. Chapter four will present the empirical results, and Chapter five will conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for scholars and practitioners al ike. 25 CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW Archbishop Desmond Tutu: \"You don't get reconciled with someone [with whom] you agree. You get reconciled with someone with whom you disagree; otherwise there would be no point in having reconciliation.\"45 Over the past few decades, reconciliation has become an integral part of the pos t-conflict peacebuilding agenda. However, while there's agreement that reconciliation i s important for the prevention of future conflict, there is no consensus or conceptual clarity on what rec onciliation means. Both the conceptualization of reconciliation as well as the operationaliz ation, or measurement, of the construct remain vague. As Meierhenrich notes, \"no genera l conceptual map has ever been drawn\u2014let alone accepted.\"46 Disciplines ranging from anthropology to law and from literature to sociolog y have incorporated the term, in widely divergent ways, into their professional discourse. 47 Over the past decade the study of reconciliation has emerged as a defined area of interest in politica l science and political psychology,48 as well as in the field of intergroup relations.49 Yet the problem of 45 Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Afric a, Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa Report , vol. 5 (London: Macmillan, 1999), 412. 46 Meierhenrich, \"Varieties of Reconciliation,\" 217. 47 Ibid. 48 M.

Does it occur between individuals, groups, politic al elites, or nations? And how can it be measured? Indeed, when it comes to reconciliation, t he lack of empirical evidence about post-conflict peacebuilding leaves scholars and prac titioners with more questions than answers. 50 Meierhenrich, \"Varieties of Reconciliation,\" 224. 51 Nadim Rouhana, N., Power in the Reco nciliation of National Conflict,\" in The social psychology of group identity and social conflict: Theory, applica tion and practice , ed.

As such, this chapter will review the literature surrounding reconciliation to identify t he interventions that scholars and practitioners have proposed may lead to reconciliation, as well as the ps ychological changes that these interventions have been credited with producing. It will then compile all of these variables into a theoretical framework for r econciliation such that the effects of each intervention can be tested on the proposed psychological changes , allowing a comprehensive theory of reconciliation to be developed over time. To that end, I will turn first to the scholarly debate over the meaning of reconciliation, which while fraught w ith lack of conceptual clarity, proposes various structural and political components of reconc iliation such as truth, justice, and restructuring of the social and political relationship betwe en the parties, as well as psychological components such as forgiveness. I will then explore the lite rature on transitional justice, which focuses largely on mechanisms for truth-telling that proponents have claimed seek to promote justice, psychological healing and reconciliation. After challenging the efficacy of transitional justice mechanisms f or promoting healing and reconciliation, this review will turn to the literature on intergroup relations, w hich explicitly focuses on promoting the psychological components of reconciliation such as a reduc tion of prejudice, and an increase in trust and forgiveness. It will conclude that while a large body of 54 \u2014\u2014\u2014, \"Key issues in reconciliation: Challenging tradit ional assumptions resolution and power dynamics.\"; Bar-Tal and Bennink, \"The Nature of Rec onciliation as an Outcome and as a Process.\"; Staub , Pearlman, and Bilali, \"Psychological recovery, reco the prevention of new violence: an a pproach and its uses in Rwanda.\" 28 research indicates that intergroup contact may be effective at promoting r econciliation, research in highly-charged, non-Western, post-conflict contexts is still lacking. The final section concludes with the theoretical framework for reconcilia tion that incorporates the range of proposed structural and political interventions, as well as the psychol ogical changes they are claimed to promote. As such, the dependent variables for this study, whic h represent the range of proposed psychological changes necessary for reconciliation, wi ll be identified, along with the psychometric scales that will be used to measure change in these va riables. Reconciliation The debate in the literature about the concept of reconciliation largely revolve s around how to catalyze the psychological changes necessary for reconciliation. Mos t scholars agree that psychological change is an important element of reconciliation, though it is not cle ar what type of psychological change or how much psychological change is sufficient to deter mine that reconciliation has occurred. Despite this lack of clarity, scholars debate t he different factors that may be necessary to achieve this psychological change. Some argue that struct ural and political changes are necessary, others call for truth, and yet others claim that for giveness is necessary. For example, Rouhana argues that psychological change will be a product of structura l and political changes that address power asymmetries. 55 He writes that reconciliation is essentially a politically driven process that entails a transformation of the power relati ons between the parties complete with constitutional and institutional changes. He claims that for ge nuine reconciliation to take root, four key issues must be addressed: justice, truth, historical responsibi lity for human 55 Rouhana, \"Key issues in reconciliation: Challengin g traditional assumptions on conflict resolution an d power dynamics.\" 29 rights abuses, and restructuring of the social and political relationship betwee n the parties to reflect the universal standards of equality, human rights and human dignity.56 He notes that intergroup reconciliation is characterized by widespread cognitive and affec tive transformations that parallel the political transformation of all parties involved. However, thes e psychological changes are not required for the process to launch, but rather the outcome of a political transformation. Bar-Tal and Bennink take a similar view, claiming that \" the essence of reconciliation is a psychological process, which consists of changes of the motivations, goals, beliefs, attitudes, and emotions of the majority of society members\" (emphasis in original).57 However, they note that structural measures such as political integration, the establishment of s tructural equality and justice, and the observance of human and civil rights as well as democratic rules of political governance both contribute to its evolvement and are among its consequences.58 Similar to those who believe that structural changes are necessary to achie ve reconciliation, proponents of transitional justice argue that truth is a necessary component of recon ciliation 59 and that \"justice and reconciliation are inherently intertwined.\" 60 Advocating truth-telling and truth-seeking mechanisms, supporters of transitional justice argue that only by establishing a historical record can the healing take place that will ultimately allow individuals to engage in reconciliation. The validity of these claims will be evaluated at length in th e next section, but 56 \u2014\u2014\u2014, \"Identity and Power in the Reconciliation of Nati onal Conflict.\" 57 Bar-Tal and Bennink, \"The Nature of Reconciliation as an Outcome and as a Process,\" 17. 58 Ibid., 15-16; 37. 59 Desmond Tutu, No future without forgiveness (New York: Doubleday, 1999); Martha Minow, Between vengeance and forgiveness: Facing history after gen ocide and mass violence (Boston: Beacon Press, 1998); Susan Dwyer, \"Reconciliation for Realists,\" Ethics and International Affairs 13(1999); D.

Tristan Anne Borer (Notre Dame, Indiana: Univ ersity of Notre Dame Press, 2006). 30 healing has been included as a dependent variable in this study in order to determine w hether intergroup contact can affect individual healing. Forgiveness is the final, and perhaps most controversial component that has been propose d as a condition of reconciliation. While the precise meaning of the term forgiveness is not often specified, there is a significant debate about whether it is necessary for re conciliation. On the one hand, Staub and Pearlman argue that forgiveness is a necessary condition for reconci liation, writing \"Reconciliation means coming to accept one another and developing mutual tr ust. This requires forgiving.\" 61 However, others such as Dwyer strongly disagree that forgiveness is a ne cessary condition for reconciliation. She argues that any conception of reconciliation that makes reconciliation dependent on forgiveness, or that emphasizes interpersonal harmony and positive fell ow-feeling, will fail to be a realistic model of reconciliation because arriving at an accommodation need not and perhaps should not involve the excusing of a wrong, and may or may not involve an apology or the offer of forgiveness.62 This is because reconciliation might be psychologically possible where forgiveness is not. 63 Yet, Meierhenrich posits exactly the opposite\u2014\"forgiveness might be psychologi cally possible where reconciliation is not. This is so because forgiveness is epistemologic ally less demanding than reconciliation, which, in addition to forgiveness, requires the accommodation of f ormer adversaries, thus demanding action (and credible commitments) from perpetrators as well as 61 Ervin Staub and Laurie Anne Pearlman, \"Healing, Re conciliation, and Forgiving after Genocide and Othe r Collective Violence,\" in Forgiveness and reconciliation: religion, public po licy and conflict transformation Helmick and 97-98. 63 Ibid., 96. 31 victims.\"64 In the case of forgiveness...the action resides solely with those who have been wronged. Whereas forgiveness involves unilateral action , reconciliation necessitates bilateral action.65 As such, he concludes that forgiveness is a necessary but not sufficient condition for reconciliation. 66 Beyond the debate over whether forgiveness is more or less psychologically demanding than reconciliation, scholars such as Rouhana criticize definitions of reconciliat ion for focusing too much on forgiveness and personal healing because they neglect the power asymm etries that caused the conflict. 67 In his analysis, forgiveness and healing are not essential to reconcili ation because forgiveness is a personal component of the post-conflict process th at individuals are entitled to deal with in a manner of their own choosing without the imposition of religious imperatives or cultural paradigms.68 He sees healing as both a social and personal process that is the outcome of structural and political change, not a substitute for it. He notes that the social context of healing is achieved by having the collective truth validated and responsibi lity assigned to perpetrators, while the individual part of healing\u2014work with victims who underwent traumatic experiences\u2014is facilitated by trained professionals working within that social context.69 While scholars have different reasons for suggesting that forgiveness may or may not be an integral component of reconciliation, little empirical evidence exists to val idate any of these claims. This dissertation will therefore adopt forgiveness as a key dependen t variable to measure whether intergroup contact can catalyze changes in forgiveness toward the outgr oup. 64 Meierhenrich, \"Varieties of Reconciliation,\" 206. 65 Ibid., 207. 66 Ibid. 67 Rouhana, \"Identity and Power in the Reconciliation of National Conflict.\" 68 Ibid. 69 Ibid., 180. 32 Finally, as scholars and practitioners continue to debate the necessary a nd sufficient conditions for reconciliation, it is important to consider whether reconciliation is in fact a realistic possibility to expect of those who have suffered gross inequalities and human rights abuses. In some cases, the answer may be no. Hayner reports the response of Horatio Verbi tsky, an Argentinean journalist, when asked about reconciliation: \"Reconciliation by who? After someone takes away your daughter, tortures her, disappears her, and then denies ever having done it\u2014would you want to \"reconcile\" with those responsible? That word makes no sense her e. The political discourse of reconciliation is profoundly immoral because it denies the reality of what people have experienced. It isn't reasonable to expect someone to reconcile a fter what happened here.\" 70 With such a wide range of perspectives about the nature of reconciliation, it is essential that scholars begin to establish empirical data that provide eviden ce about what psychological changes take place in post-conflict societies, the interventio ns that precipitate these changes, and whether these changes in fact amount to reconciliation. Transitional Justice Since the Nuremberg Trials following World War II, transitional justice has been the dominant paradigm for seeking reconciliation in post-conflict societies. At least f orty truth commissions and hundreds of prosecutions have taken place in countries including South Africa, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Timor Leste and Liberia, and as was shown in Chapter 1, thes e transitional justice mechanisms have been the main tool of efforts to encourage reconciliation inc luded in peace agreements for over two decades. 71 70 Hayner, Unspeakable Truths: Confronting state terror and at rocity : 188. 71 See the Peace Accords Matrix (PAM) compiled by the University of Notre Dame's Kroc Institute for Inte rnational Peace Studies available at http://kroc.nd.edu/resea rch/peace-processes. 33 Throughout, proponents of transitional justice have made sweeping claims about the i mpact of truth-telling and truth-seeking, including that they lead to psychological heali ng and reconciliation. Yet, recent literature has begun to refute claims that t ransitional justice contributes to reconciliation and psychological healing, calling into question the di rection the international community has taken by allowing transitional justice mechani sms to dominate the agenda for promoting reconciliation in conflict-affected societies.72 This section will therefore examine the empirical evidence surrounding the t ransitional justice mechanisms of tribunals and truth commissions in light of the claims made by propon ents of transitional justice and will conclude that insufficient evidence exists to subs tantiate claims that truth-telling and truth-seeking lead to reconciliation. While truth-telli ng may be effective at establishing a historical record for a country, providing a basis for acknowledgem ent of past wrongs, administering reparations to victims and their families, and perhaps even for providing a sense of justice and democracy to victims, research is showing that these m echanisms may actually hinder psychological recovery and reconciliation. 73 As such, this section will not argue that truth-telling and truth-seeking ar e not important components of the post-conflict peacebuilding agenda, but rather that they should not be seen as 72 Broun\u00e9us, \"The trauma of truth telling: Effects of witnessing in the Rwandan gacaca courts on psychol ogical health.\"; Oskar Thoms, N.T., James Ron, and Roland Paris, \"The effects of transitional justice mechan isms: A summary of empirical research findings and implicat ions for analysts and practitioners,\" (Ottawa: Cent er for International Policy Studies, 2008)., 73 Broun\u00e9us, \"The trauma of truth telling: Effects of witnessing in the Rwandan gacaca courts on psychol ogical health.\"; Phuong N.

Instead, this sect ion will conclude that in light of growing research supporting the efficacy of intergroup contact , transitional justice mechanisms should be seen only as one piece of a larger and more comprehensive ag enda toward promoting post-conflict reconciliation that may also include intergroup cont act initiatives. The Logic of truth-telling and truth-seeking: The post-conflict justice literature is dominated by a debate over alternative truth-telling mechanisms\u2014namely, the relat ive merits of retributive versus restorative justice approaches. 74 Advocates of both sides share the same core belief that public accounting for wartime misconduct is necessary for peace and stabilit y. They differ only over the mechanisms by which the truth is uncovered and how that information is used\u2014eit her to punish those found guilty of abuses or merely to expose such actions in the court of public opinion.75 Truth commissions, it is said, work toward these ends through the process of \"restor ative justice,\" which is defined as societal healing of damages resulting from pas t crimes. Restorative justice focuses on victims and perpetrators and tries to restore their dignity not t hrough recrimination but by \"mediation and dialogue\" so as \"to generate the space for e xpressions of approbation, remorse, and pardon, as well as the resolution of conflicts.\"76 Operating without judges, courtrooms, and the cumbersome trappings (and safeguards) of legal procedure, they do not seek punishment or retribution. While the strongest commissions have been endowed with 74 David Mendeloff, \"Trauma and vengeance: Assessing the psychological and emotional effects of post-con flict justice,\" Human Rights Quarterly 31, no. 3 (2009). 75 \u2014\u2014\u2014, \"Truth-Telling, and Postconflict Peacebuilding: C urb the Enthusiasm?,\" International Studies Review 6, no. 3 (2004). 76 Eric Stover and Harvey M. Weinstein, eds., My Neighbor, My Enemy: Justice and Community in the Aftermath of Mass Atrocity (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004). 35 search-and-seizure powers, the right to issue court-backed subpoenas, and most contr oversially, the power to grant individual amnesties, their task is to uncover just what happened to whom i n the past, and why. Who did it is rarely stressed. Few truth commissions name names of vi olators, and when they do it is for purposes of moral and perhaps social censure\u2014but never legal retribution.77 The retributive approach views justice largely as a means of taming veng eance by transferring the responsibility for apportioning blame and punishment from victims to a court that ac ts according to the rule of law. Retributive justice, it is said, promotes reconcili ation by holding individuals accountable for past crimes, not entire groups or communities, and thus reduci ng the desire to exact revenge against entire groups. By establishing individual gui lt in the immediate aftermath of war and ethnic cleansing, it is theorized that retributive jus tice helps dispel the notion of collective blame for war crimes and acts of genocide.78 Proponents of transitional justice offer myriad claims about the peace-promoting effects of truth- telling. They claim that truth-telling 1) encourages social healing and rec onciliation, 2) promotes justice, 3) allows for the establishment of an official historical record, 4) s erves a public education function, 5) aids institutional reform, 6) helps promote democracy, and 7) preem pts as well as 8) deters future atrocities. 79 While transitional justice scholars increasingly view both truth-telling approaches as complementary, rather than competing,80 there remains a tendency to 77 Tepperman, \"Truth and Consequences.\" 78 Stover and Weinstein, My Neighbor, My Enemy: Justice and Community in the Aftermath of Mass Atrocity . 79 Mendeloff, \"Truth-Telling, and Landscape of Transiti onal Justice,\" in Transitional Justice in the Twenty-First Century: Beyond Truth Versus Justice , ed. ustice,\" Human Rights Quarterly 30(2008). 36 see \"victim-centered\" truth commissions as more \"therapeutic\" and benefi cial to victims than an adversarial criminal tribunal.81 In the next section, I will examine only the claim that transitional justic e encourages social healing and reconciliation. I will ask whether the literature substantiat es claims that \"After an international conflict or civil war in which grave human rights abuses have been com mitted the truth must be told before there can be a successful reconciliation.\"82 Does it hold that \"by exposing the truth of past crimes, victims and survivors can begin to heal from the traum a of war and receive closure?\" And that \"Once they have begun to heal, they can then work toward reconciling with their former adversaries.\" 83 Are \"remembering and telling the truth about terrible events prerequisites both for the restoration of the social order and for the healing of individual victims? 84 Is truth-telling in fact therapeutic? And as the South African TRC proclaimed, is truth the road to reconciliation? The Evidence on truth-telling and truth-seeking: Neither the evidence from truth commissions nor tribunals substantiates claims that post-conflict justice leads to healing and/or reconciliation. While there is some evidence that truth-telling and truth-seeking are eff ective at producing a historical record, 85 at creating awareness of past atrocities,86 at promoting the rule of law and 81 Mendeloff, \"Trauma and vengeance: Assessing the ps ychological and emotional effects of post-conflict justice.\" 82 IDEA, \"Reconciliation After Violent Conflict: A Ha ndbook,\" ed.

While Gibson found greater tolerance and a larger propensity t oward reconciliation among South Africans, particularly white South Africans, fol lowing the South African TRC, Tepperman reports that a poll of South Africans following the conc lusion of the TRC found that two-thirds of South Africans felt the commission's revelations had only made them angrier and contributed to a worsening of race relations. 88 A mere 17 percent of those polled predicted that people would become more forgiving as a result of the TRC.89 This contradictory evidence indicates that more empirical work is necessary to dr aw firm conclusions about whether the South African TRC was indeed beneficial for reconciliation. A s such, Gibson's definition of tolerance as the commitment of people to put up with each other, eve n those whose political ideas they thoroughly detest is included as a dependent varia ble in this study. The evidence from South Africa also calls into question claims that truth-tel ling leads to healing. Allan and Allan find no empirical or other data suggesting that any long-term healing followed for witnesses who experienced catharsis while giving testimony to the S outh African TRC.90 In fact, they cite anecdotal evidence that the experience sometimes caused im mediate and perhaps 87 Ba olu et al., \"Psychiatric and Cognitive Effects of Wa r in Former Yugoslavia: Association of Lack of Redr ess for Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Reactions.\"; Ph am, Weinstein, and Longman, \"Trauma and PTSD: Their Implication for Attitudes towards Justice and Recon ciliation.\" 88 Gibson, Overcoming apartheid: Can truth reconcile a divided nation ; Tepperman, \"Truth and Consequences.\" 89 \u2014\u2014\u2014, \"Truth and Consequences.\" 90 and Allan, \"The South African Truth and Reco nciliation Commission as a Therapeutic Tool.\" 38 enduring trauma for those who testified. Kaminer et al. report a similar fi nding from a nonrandomized epidemiological study assessing psychological health in 134 survivor s who had or had not given testimony in the South African TRC. 91 They report that testifying had no effect on mental health, either positive or negative. The evidence from Rwanda does not seem to differ from that of South Africa. In an importa nt effort to contribute empirical evidence to the debate surrounding transitional just ice, Broun\u00e9us examined the psychological effects of the gacaca process in Rwanda, the l argest officially driven truth and reconciliation process in the world today. 92 She conducted a multistage, stratified cluster random survey of 1,200 Rwandans in four provinces that operationalized healing as \"psychological health\" measuring clinically significant symptoms of dep ression and PTSD. Broun\u00e9us's work demonstrates that gacaca witnesses suffer from higher lev els of depression and PTSD than do non-witnesses. She also found that longer exposure to truth telling did not lowe r the levels of psychological ill health, nor reduce the prevalence of depression and PTS D over time. That witnesses suffer from higher levels of depression and PTSD than nonwit nesses suggests that truth-telling may be more distressing than healing.93 Additionally, survivors who had witnessed in the gacaca had a 20 percent higher relat ive risk of having depression and a 40 percent higher relative risk of having PTSD compared to sur vivors 91 Kaminer et al., \"The Truth and Reconciliation Comm ission in South Africa: Relation to psychiatric sta tus and forgiveness among survivors of human rights abuses. \" 92 Gacaca were initiated by the Government of Rwanda in 2002 as a pilot in certain communities, then lau nched nationwide three years later in 2005. More than fif teen thousand gacaca courts are presently underway, conducted by locally elected lay judges and unyangamugayo and involving the entire population by mandatory p articipation. The gacaca takes place once a week in every village in Rwanda. The proceedings are held in a schoolroo m or most often outdoors with a panel of nine judges, the acc used perpetrator, the witness, and the assembled vi llagers as audience. At least one hundred people must have gat hered before the proceedings begin. Broun\u00e9us, \"The trauma of truth telling: Effects of witnessing in the Rwandan gacaca courts on psychological health.\" 93 Ibid. 39 who had not witnessed. 94 The situation was even worse for inyangamugayo (judges in the gacaca) and neighbors who witnessed with the relative risk of having depression 60 per cent higher and PTSD 75 percent higher than those who did not witness in the gacaca. Broun\u00e9us suggests this may be because witnessing involved even greater distress for t his group as they may be seen and felt as if they were betraying their own group. A similar s tudy conducted in 2002 in Rwanda demonstrated that respondents who had experienced high levels of trauma or met the criteria for PTSD were less likely to support the gacaca and less open to reconciliation.95 The literature on clinical psychology partially explains these finding s. While there is no consensus among psychologists on how best to treat victims of emotional trauma, 96 psychological research has shown that exposure to the traumatic event, through eit her imagery (thinking of the event) or in vivo exposure (going to places or situations that strongly r emind of the trauma), is an essential component in psychological treatment of PTSD.97 While treatment of PTSD is highly individualized and there is debate over whether cognitive behavioral or exposure therapies work best, most psychologists agree that gradual exposure to the traum atic event over time leads to decreased levels of anxiety and fear. 94 Survivors are in a small minority at the gacaca, s urrounded by a majority Hutu (85 percent). Tutsi co nstitute 14 percent of the total population.

A 2002 Cochrane Review of a one-session debriefing, a type of early psycholo gical intervention after a traumatic experience with the aim of preventing subse quent psychological ill health, found no evidence that one-session debriefing is useful in preventing or reducing the severity of depression, PTSD, anxiety, or general psychological morbidity and was recommended to cease.98 Broun\u00e9us notes that both one-session debriefing and witnessing in a TRC involve short and intensive trauma exposure, which research shows has risks of incr easing trauma reactions because there is no time for desensitization or relearning.99 While research shows that exposure to the traumatic event gradually leads to habituation or desensitization such that the traumatic stressor will no longer evoke high level s of anxiety and fear, it also shows that if the exposure is too short, this learning process cannot be made and the trauma is maintained or intensified. 100 Broun\u00e9us suggests that the protraction of the truth-telling process may involve an ineffective, repetitive exposure to suffering similar t o rumination, the incessant, repetitive thinking about past trauma, which is frequently reported i n individuals with PTSD and which has been found to be not only a strategy to cope with intrusive memories of trauma but also a trigger of such memoires, resulting in a cyclical process .101 Michael et al. suggest that instead of leading to successful emotional processing of trauma, rum ination becomes a type of avoidance strategy, prolonging PTSD and depression. 102 As such, psychologists generally concur that cathartic experiences should be avoided except under highly 98 Rose, Bisson, and Wessely, \"Psychological debriefi ng \"A cognitive neuroscience account of postt treatment.\"; Bisson, and debriefing Lars- G\u00f6ran, \"Cognitive-behavior therapy vs exposure ther in the treatment of PTSD in refugees.\"; van Emm erik et al., \"Single trau A meta-analysis.\" 100 Broun\u00e9us, \"The trauma of truth telling: Effects of witnessing in the Rwandan gacaca courts on psychol ogical health.\" 101 Tanja Michael et \"Rumination stress disorder,\" Depression and Anxiety 24(2007). 102 Ibid. 41 controlled conditions because the dangers of retraumatization could be much greater t han the potential benefits. 103 Given the short, intense, public exposure of witnesses to a truth-telling process, there is reason for concern that the process may be detrimental to psyc hological healing and potentially to reconciliation. Accordingly, interviews by Hamber et al. with twenty survivors who were invol ved with the South African TRC found that while 60 percent of the respondents reported optimism about the benefits of truth-telling before they gave or submitted testimony, only 10 p ercent had a positive view after the fact. 104 Thirty-five percent actually had a negative view of the experience and 55 percent were \"ambivalent\" about it. Seventy percent reported feeling \"let down\" and disappointed with the outcome. Of those who testified (eight out of twenty), half felt re gret for doing so or felt cheated by the process, while the other half felt relief and co mfort. A similar study by Byrne interviewed thirty survivors who participated in the TRC found that 23.3 percent of those who participated in the study \"felt they benefited from and shared positive reactions regarding the experience of testifying. 105 However, eighty percent felt \"the process involved considerable emotional pain.\" The variance in reactions to truth-telling refle cts the highly individualized nature of trauma recovery and suggests that while truth-telling ma y have positive effects for some, in many cases it has no effect or even negative effect for v ictims. The evidence on the psychological outcomes of truth-seeking tribunals is similarl y bleak. Herman writes \"if one set out intentionally to design a system for provoking sympt oms of 103 Allan and Allan, \"The South African Truth and Reco nciliation Commission as a Therapeutic Tool.\":472-4 73; Minow, Between vengeance and forgiveness: Facing history a fter genocide and mass violence ; Hayner, Unspeakable Truths: Confronting state terror and at rocity .

For many victims, the criminal justice system is profoundly disappoint ing and can be potentially damaging to victims. High expectations are frequently dashed, a nd generate feelings of resentment, anger and betrayal.110 In some cases, testifying may retraumatize victims, though some studies have disputed that finding. 111 106 Judith Herman, \"The Mental Health of Crime Victims : Impact of Legal Intervention,\" Journal of Traumatic Stress 16, no. 2 (2003). 107 Stover and Weinstein, My Neighbor, My Enemy: Justice and Community in the Aftermath of Mass Atrocity . 108 Jamie O'Connell, \"Gambling with the psyche: Does p rosecuting human rights violators console their vic tims?,\" Harvard International Law Journal 46, no. 2 (2005). 109 Ibid. 110 Ibid. 111 Ulrich Crime Victims?,\" Journal of Interpersonal Violence 19(2004). 43 Similar to questionable effects of truth commissions on reconciliation, resear chers are also questioning claims that tribunals are beneficial for reconciliation. Meer nik found that arrests or judgments against war criminals in the ICTY were correlated with increa sed hostility between ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina and concluded that the ICTY has not had a meaningful effect on societal peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 112 Likewise, Corkalo et al. describe how all national groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2014Bosniak, Croat, and Serb\u2014felt that their own national group was the greatest victim in the war and that the ICTY was prej udiced against their own group.113 As such, it seems that in reality, judicial mechanisms contribute far less to t he social reconstruction of post-conflict societies than was previously assumed. 114 As Stover points out, \"Many of the assumptions about the effects that justice has on individuals and societ ies have gone unexamined and unchallenged far too long. Seldom are the assertions grounded in empirical data. The pursuit of criminal justice, as important as it is, should not be held up as some kind of panacea for righting past wrongs or as a \"magic bullet\" for \"hea ling\" victims and war-torn societies.\" 115 Scholars such as O'Connell have therefore concluded \"policymakers, activists, a nd survivors themselves should hesitate to pursue judicial action against human rights violators as a means for helping victims psychologically, until and unless further research shows that judic ial actions have a net therapeutic effect on most survivors...Generally, however, those seeking to help 112 James Meernik, \"Justice and Peace?

Instead, they should devote gr eater attention to non-judicial initiatives that may address psychological aftere ffects of human rights violations more reliably.\" 116 However, it is worth noting that despite evidence that truth-telling and truth-s eeking can be harmful to witnesses' psychological health and may not be beneficial for reconc iliation, research finds strong demands among survivors for post-conflict justice and accountability. Em pirical work in Bosnia and Croatia, 117 and Argentina, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, South Africa and Uganda have documented these demands in the aftermath of violent conflict. 118 Moreover, Backer found that the majority of witnesses in the South African TRC would testi fy again even if they had known the anguish it entailed beforehand. 119 Even though 56 percent reported that giving a statement was \"very upsetting,\" an even higher number (64 percent) \" believed they gained something positive\" from the experience. As such, there is reason to beli eve that the process of truth-telling and truth-seeking may have benefits other than psycholog ical healing and reconciliation for victims. Given the above discussion, it is likely that truth commissions and prosecutions may hav e some benefits for conflict-affected societies, but there remains insuffic ient empirical evidence to demonstrate that psychological healing and reconciliation are among them. A s such, it is 116 O'Connell, \"Gambling with the psyche: Does prosecu ting human rights violators console their victims?, \" 340. 117 Metin et al.

To that end, the next section provides a review of the social psychologica l literature on intergroup relations theory, the foundation for intergroup contact programs, which thi s dissertation will test as a potential complementary approach to transitional justice. Moreover, this dissertation includes healing as a dependent variable in an effort t o measure the effects of alternative interventions on healing and reconciliation. Simila r to the work of Broun\u00e9us, psychological healing will be operationalized by changes in anxiet y, depression and PTSD. The psychometric scales used to measure these constructs are discu ssed below. As will be explained in the theoretical framework proposed in the final section of this chapter, t his methodology can also be used to measure the effects of other interventions proposed to contribute to reconciliation, including transitional justice mechanisms, in order t hat a comprehensive theory of reconciliation can ultimately be established. Intergroup Relations Theory Steeped in the contact hypothesis originally posited by Gordan Allport in 1954, decades of social psychological research have now developed into a robust theory of intergroup relations , which demonstrates that intergroup contact can promote reductions in intergroup prejudice i n a wide range of situations. 120 As scholars and practitioners continue to experiment with intergroup contact, they are finding that contact not only reduces prejudice, but has also been l inked to 120 Pettigrew and Tropp, \"A Meta-Analytic Test of Inte rgroup Contact Theory.\" 46 increases in intergroup trust, empathy and forgiveness. 121 This section will briefly review these findings, explaining why these variables have been adopted as dependent variables i n this study. The idea behind the contact hypothesis is that hostility between groups is fed by unf amiliarity and separation and that under the right conditions, contact among members of different g roups will reduce hostility and promote more positive intergroup attitudes. 122 Allport originally noted four optimal conditions that were necessary for contact to lead to a reduction in pr ejudice: 1) the contact should take place between equal status members of groups; 2) it should have the s upport of the relevant authorities; 3) it should produce opportunities for intimate contact, and; 4) the conditions of contact should facilitate intergroup cooperation. He hypothesized that these conditions may provide positive experiences with outgroup members that disconfirm or undermine previous negative attitudes and ultimately change attitudes toward and be liefs about the group as a whole. 123 Today, groundbreaking research is confirming that contact can indeed reduce interg roup prejudice. In an important meta-analytic study, Pettigrew and Tropp rigo rously reviewed 515 studies of intergroup contact. 124 The results clearly indicate that intergroup contact typically reduces intergroup prejudice. In fact, 94% of the samples in the analysis showed an inve rse relationship between intergroup contact and prejudice.125 The study has also shown that intergroup contact effects typically generalize beyond participants 121 M. Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup forgiveness and g uilt in Northern Ireland: Social psychological dime nsions of 'The in Collective University Press, 2004); Hewstone et al., \"Intergro up Contact, Forgiveness, and Experience of \"The Tro ubles\" in Northern Ireland.\" 122 Brewer and Gaertner, \"Toward Reduction of Prejudic e: Intergroup Contact and Social rgroup Contact 125 Ibid., 766. 47 in the immediate contact situation.126 Not only do attitudes toward immediate participants usually become more favorable, but so do attitudes toward the entire outgroup, outgroup members in other situations, and even outgroups not involved in the contact. Additionally, the study finds that Allport's conditions are not essential for inte rgroup contact to achieve positive outcomes, showing that samples with no claim to these conditions sti ll show significant relationships between contact and prejudice. The authors conclude that Allport's conditions should not be regarded as necessary for producing positive contact outcomes, however they act as facilitating conditions that enhance the tendency for posit ive contact outcomes to emerge. A third finding of this important work is that intergroup contact may be useful in a var iety of situations beyond racial and ethnic conflicts. The study showed that the relationships between contact and prejudice remained significant across samples involving different ta rget groups, age groups, geographical areas, and contact settings. This provides substantial evidenc e that intergroup contact can contribute meaningfully to reductions in prejudice across a br oad range of groups and contexts. However, while Pettigrew & Tropp's meta-analytic study shows that contac t can reduce intergroup prejudice in a variety of contexts, little work has been done to demonstrate the effects of contact in a highly charged conflict or post-conflict setting. 127 While 51% of the samples in Pettigrew & Tropp's meta-analytic study represent cases of contac t between racial and ethnic 126 Ibid. 127 \u2014\u2014\u2014, \"How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice? Me ta-analytic tests of three mediators,\" European Journal of Social Psychology 38(2008). 48 groups, only 7.6% of the samples are cases of intergroup contact experiences t hat take place in Africa, Asia or Latin-America between adults. While Pettigrew & Tropp show that no significant differences in effects are found in different geographical locations, it is important that researchers increase the body of case knowledge in non-Western and post-conflict contexts so that we are better able to understand whethe r intergroup contact can reduce prejudice between social groups with \"a history of conflic t and hostility, inequalities of status and power, and political struggle.\"128 As such, this dissertation will contribute to the literature by adding a rigorous analysis of the effe cts of intergroup contact on prejudice in an Asian country, as well as a highly charged post-conflict conte xt. In addition to studies demonstrating that intergroup contact can reduce prejudice, He wstone et al. have shown that contact with outgroup friends between Catholics and Protestants in Nort hern Ireland corresponds to a greater willingness to forgive and trust the outgroup. 129 This may be because having a close outgroup friend promotes perspective taking, the cognitive component of empathy, which seems to be a mediator in predicting outgroup attitudes including pre judice, trust and forgiveness. However, these studies are based on observational data in which survey research aske d respondents about their previous contact with members of the outgroup and their prevailin g attitudes toward that group. They are not based on experimental research in whic h a treatment such as facilitated intergroup contact was applied to subjects and the outcome mea sured. As such, it is uncertain whether the conclusion that intergroup contact enhances outgroup atti tudes 128 \" Brewer and Gaertner, \"Toward Reduction of Prejud ice: Intergroup Contact and Social Categorization,\" 301. 129 Hewstone et al., \"Stepping stones to reconciliatio n in Northern Ireland: Intergroup contact, forgiven ess and trust.\"; Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup forgiveness a nd guilt in Northern Ireland: Social psychological dimensions of \"The Troubles\".\"; Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup Cont act, Forgiveness, and Experience of \"The Troubles\" in Northern Ireland.\" 49 such as trust and forgiveness applies to situations of facilitated intergroup contac t or only to existing contact with members of the outgroup. This study therefore includes tr ust, forgiveness and empathy as dependent variables in order to test whether the observational findi ngs of previous studies apply to facilitated intergroup contact. A Theoretical Framework for Reconciliation It is clear from the literature that there is not yet an agreed upon concept of reconciliation, nor a definitive understanding of the conditions that are necessary and sufficient to ac hieve reconciliation. As such, this dissertation seeks to contribute to theory-building by developing a theoretical framework that allows these conditions to be tested. To that en d, I propose that reconciliation is the psychological change that takes place at the individual level (indicated b y variables such as prejudice, empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness and/or heal ing) in a post- conflict context, which is caused by some combination of interventions that may include structural and political change, truth, justice, historical responsibility for hum an rights abuses, intergroup contact, etc. 130 130 A post-conflict context, environment or society re fers to situations in which the population has expe rienced violent inter-group conflict and has already achiev ed a political settlement via a peace agreement. Th e scope of this dissertation is limited to post-conflict societies and will not make claims about conflicts in which a political settlement has not yet been reached. 50 Because this conceptualization of reconciliation allows various interventions to be categorized as independent variables and psychological changes to be categorized as dependent variables and measured at the individual level using psychometric scales, it enables the us e of field experimental methodologies to measure the impact of each of the proposed interventions . While this does not answer the question 'How do we know when we've achieved reconciliation,' i t is theoretically possible that 'reconciliation scores' established over tim e in post conflict societies could ultimately be used to determine the threshold at which post-conflict societie s resolve conflict through dialogue rather than violence, which I propose is the threshold at whi ch reconciliation has been sufficiently achieved. For example, by comparing scores across conflicts over time on the various sc ales that measure the psychological changes that serve as proxies for reconciliation, it would be possible to determine the level or scores at which violence does not recur. Practitioner s could therefore 51 continue reconciliation initiatives until that threshold was reached. As suc h, this research would ultimately indicate which combination of variables lead to reconciliation and how much reconciliation is minimally sufficient to prevent a return to violence. While it is not within the scope of this dissertation to test the full theory, I w ill contribute to theory-building by positing a clear concept of reconciliation and testing one part of the theory: the effect of intergroup contact on reconciliation, which will be measured by ch anges in the dependent variables prejudice, empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness and healing. The next section provides a detailed account of the psychometric scales that were used i n this study to measure each of the variables, while the complete surveys administered to r espondents are included in Appendices A and B. If similar techniques are used by other scholars to m easure the effects of interventions aimed at reconciliation such as truth commissions, prose cutions, structural and political change, etc., we will begin to gather enough empirical evidence to build a comprehensive theory of reconciliation. Operationalizing the Dependent Variables Prejudice: Prejudice is defined in this study as a negative attitude toward members of a social outgroup.131 Social psychologists have distinguished between three components of prejudice: affective components (negative feelings); cognitive components (negative stereotypes); and behavioral components.132 This dissertation will therefore examine how contact affects all three components of prejudice. 131 Allport, The Nature of Prejudice ; J. Harding et al., \"On the fading of social stere otypes: Studies in three generations of college students,\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 13(1969); R.D.

Sears, Leonie Huddy, and Robert Jervis (Oxford: Oxf ord University Press, 2003). 52 Affective prejudice: The affective component of prejudice was measured by combining the items developed by Stephan and Stephan, 133 also used by Tropp and Pettigrew,134 and the items developed by Stangor, Sullivan & Ford .135 Respondents were asked to report the extent to which they would expect to feel ten different emotional states (five positive and five ne gative) when interacting with the outgroup. Item responses included 1 (not at all), 2 (a little) , 3 (average), 4 (a lot). When I think about the outgroup, I feel... /square4 Positive emotions: o Respect o Comfortable o Relaxed o Accepted o Sympathetic /square4 Negative emotions: o Afraid o Angry o Suspicious 133 Items developed by Stephan and Stephan include: Po sitive emotions (confident, accepted, secure, comfo rtable, relaxed); Negative emotions (suspicious, awkward, t hreatened, nervous, apprehensive). 134 Linda R.

Stangor, Sullivan and Ford as ked subjects to check either yes or no to each emot ion. They instructed subjects to think about the outgroup, th en think about their feelings about the outgroup. T hey asked \"has the outgroup ever, because of something they have d one or something you know about them, ever made you feel: Positive emotions (hopeful, inspired, proud, respec tful, sympathetic); Negative emotions (afraid, angr y, disgusted, frustrated, uneasy).\" 53 o Vengeance/the need for revenge o Hatred Cognitive prejudice: The cognitive component of prejudice was measured by adapting the warmth and competence scales developed by Fiske et al. 136 Participants were asked to rate the following questions on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very) . Fiske's warmth scale initially included two additional questions that asked about perceptions of good- naturedness and sincerity, but we ultimately deleted these questions after fie ld testing the questionnaire because translations of these terms into Indonesian was redundant wi th other terms. Competence: /square4 As viewed by members of society, how competent are members of outgroup? /square4 As viewed by members of society, how confident are members of outgroup? /square4 As viewed by members of society, how capable are members of outgroup? /square4 As viewed by members of society, how efficient/useful are members of outgroup? /square4 As viewed by members of society, how intelligent are members of outgroup? /square4 As viewed by members of society, how skillful are members of outgroup? Warmth: /square4 As viewed by members of society, how friendly are members of outgroup? /square4 As viewed by members of society, how well-intentioned are members of outgroup? /square4 As viewed by members of society, how trustworthy are members of outgroup? /square4 As viewed by members of society, how warm are members of outgroup? Status: 136 Susan T. Fiske et al., \"A model of (often mixed) stereotype content: Competence and warmth respectiv ely follow from perceived status and competition \" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 82, no. 6 (2002). 54 /square4 How prestigious are jobs typically achieved by members of the outgroup? /square4 How economically successful have members of the outgroup been? Competition: /square4 If members of the outgroup get special breaks (such as priority in hiring decisi ons), this is likely to make things more difficult for people like me. /square4 Resources that go to members of this group are likely to take away from the resourc es of people like me. (We ultimately translated this as Do you feel disappointed if resources go to members of their group and you don't get any?) Behavioral prejudice: The behavioral component of prejudice was measured by adapting Bogardus' social distance scale, which was designed to measure the extent to w hich people wish to maintain social distance and avoid increasing levels of intimate contact bet ween themselves and members of different social, racial, ethnic, or national groups.137 Respondents are asked whether they would be willing to admit members of the outgroup to their country as visitors (farthest social distance), as citizens, into employment in their occupation, into residence in their neighborhood, as friends, and into close kinship by marriage (closest social distance ). I adapted this scale as follows: If given the opportunity, I would... Yes No 7. Exclude members of the outgroup from my country ___ ___ 6. Admit members of the outgroup only as visitors to my country ___ ___ 137 E.S. Bogardus, \"The measurement of social distance ,\" in Readings in social psychology , ed. T.M. Newcomb and E.L. Hartley (New York: Holt, 1928); Monica Biernat and Christian S. Crandall, \"Racial Attitudes,\" in Measures of Political Attitudes , ed. John P. Robinson, Phillip R. Shaver, and Lawr ence Wrightsman, S., Measures of Social Psychological Attitudes (San Diego: Academic Press, 1999). 55 5. Admit members of the outgroup as citizens to my country ___ ___ 4. Allow members of the outgroup to be employed in my occupation ___ ___ 3. Allow members of the outgroup to live in my village ___ ___ 2. Allow members of the outgroup to join my group/club as friends ___ ___ 1. Allow an outgroup member to marry into my family ___ ___ Empathy: Unlike the well-developed and highly validated scales used to measure prejudice th at have been developed over fifty plus years of research, the notions of empathy, trust and forgiveness are relatively new and the psychometric scales used to measure th em are still under construction. Hewstone et al. have been extremely influential in adapting and developi ng scales to measure empathy, trust and forgiveness. As such, this study adapted the scal e developed for use in Northern Ireland by Hewstone et al., which was adapted from Davis' 1994 Interpersonal Reactivity Index.138 It measures both the affective and cognitive components of empathy. For translation reasons, we used only three of the original four questions to measure t he affective component of empathy. Participants were asked to rate the answers to the follow ing questions on a four-point Likert scale (1-never; 2-rarely; 3-sometimes; 4-often). 1. If you hear about their misfortunes, do you often feel upset? 2. When you see them being treated unfairly, do you often feel pity for them? 138 Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup Contact, Forgiveness, and Experience \"The Troubles\" in Northern Irela nd.\"; M.H.

How often do you feel concerned about people from their group who are less fortunate than you? The scale also measured the cognitive component of empathy or perspective- taking, which can be understood as the ability to see the point of view of the other. Participants were a lso asked to rate the answers to the following questions on a four-point Likert scale (1-ne ver; 2-rarely; 3- sometimes; 4-often). 1. Do you often find it difficult to see things from their point of view? 2. Do you often try to think about the conflict from their perspective as well as yours ? 3. If there's a problem or misunderstanding, do you often try to see things from their perspective? Trust: This study measured trust by adopting the scale used by Hewstone et al., w hich was developed based on the work of Brehm and Rahn and worded to assess outgroup trust. 139 It used three items on a scale (1-disagree strongly; 2-disagree ; 3-agree; 4-agree strongly): 1. Do you think most members of the other community would try to take advantage of you if they got a chance instead of being fair? 2. Do you agree that most of the time members of the other community try to be helpful, and are not just looking out for themselves? 3. Do you agree that most members of the other community can be trusted? Tolerance: This study used James Gibson's definition of tolerance developed for his work studying reconciliation in South Africa. 140 Gibson defined tolerance as the commitment of 139 Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup forgiveness and guilt in Northern Ireland: Social psychological dimensio ns of 'The Troubles'.\"; John Brehm and Wendy Rahn, \"Individual -level evidence for the causes and consequences of social capital,\" American Jounral of Political Science 41, no. 3 (1997). 57 people to put up with each other, even those whose political ideas they thoroughly detest and asked participants to respond to the three questions below. Similarly, this study a sked participants to rate the answers to the following questions used by Gibson on a 4-point Likert scale (1-disagree strongly; 2-disagree; 3-agree; 4-agree strongly) : Do you agree that members of the outgroup should be prohibited from standing as a candidate for an elected position in Aceh? Do you agree that members of the outgroup should be allowed to hold street demonstrations in your community? Do you agree that they should be officially banned from your community? Forgiveness: This study adapted the Intergroup Forgiveness Scale developed by Hewstone et al. to assess forgiveness in Northern Ireland. 141 Their scale was based on a short form of the Enright Forgiveness Inventory (EFI), a widely used measure of interpersonal forg iveness, adapted to measure intergroup forgiveness. 142 For translation reasons, we adapted their eight question scale to become a seven question scale. On a 4-point Likert scale (1-disagree strong ly; 2-disagree; 3- agree; 4-agree strongly), participants were asked to answer the follow ing seven questions designed to tap the affective, cognitive and behavioral components of forgiveness: 1. Do you agree that the two communities must learn not to retaliate when there i s a problem? 2. Do you agree that it is important that your community never forgets the wrongs done by the other community? 140 Gibson, Overcoming apartheid: Can truth reconcile a divided nation? 141 Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup forgiveness and guilt in Northern Ireland: Social psychological dimensio ns of 'The Troubles'.\" 142 S. J. Rique, psyc hology of interpersonal forgiveness,\" in Exploring forgiveness R.D. Enright and J. Noah (Wisconsin: The Univ ersity of Wisconsin Press, 1998). 58 3. Do you agree that both parties should forgive each other to maintain the peace? 4. Do you agree that it is important that your community never forgives the wrong s done to you by their group? 5. Do you agree that if you forgive them, your group will appear weak? 6. Do you agree that your group should apologize to them? 7. Do you agree that Aceh will never move from the past to the future until the two communities learn to forget about the past? Healing: The healing portion of this study was designed to complement research done in 2006- 2007 by the International Organization on Migration (IOM) and the World Bank in partners hip with researchers from the Harvard Medical School and Syiah Kuala University assessing mental health and psychosocial needs throughout Aceh.143 This dissertation used these same measures to assess symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety in order to produce results that could be meaningfully compared. As such, I used a 25 question version of the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire to measure symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and a 25 question version of the Hopkins Sympt om Checklist for Depression and Anxiety.144 Both scales are used widely in disaster and trauma community assessments of emotional distress. The questions I used at the beginni ng of survey 1 143 IOM, \"Psychosocial needs assessment of communities affected by conflict in the districts of Pidie, Bi reuen and Aceh Utara,\" \u2014\u2014\u2014 , \"A psychosocial needs assessment of communities i n 14 conflict affects districts in Aceh,\" (http://ghsm.hms.harvard.edu/uploads/pdf/goo d_M_PNA1.pdf: International Organization for Migrat Caspi-Yavin Y., Bollini P., Truong T J, \"The Harvard Trauma Questionn aire.

See questionairre 1 and 2 in Appendixes A and B for a full list of questions. Additional measures: The questionnaire also measured several additional variables including preexisting contact with outgroup members and perceptions of current political i ssues. The questions for measuring contact were drawn from Tropp and Pettigrew's meas ure of intergroup closeness in which the answers to the following questions were averaged to cre ate an overall measure of intergroup closeness: 146 /square4 Quantity o How many people of the other group do you know at least as acquaintances? o How many people of the other group do you consider to be friends? /square4 Quality o How close do you feel to the members of the other group that you know? o How close do you feel to the one person of the other group with whom you have the closest relationship? Participants were also asked to respond on a 4-point Likert scale to the following s ix questions regarding perceptions of societal and political issues. These questions were designed to reflect contentious topics of political debate within the target communities in order that I could 145 IOM, \"A psychosocial needs assessment of communiti es in 14 conflict affects districts in Aceh,\" 11. 146 Tropp and Pettigrew, \"Differential Relationships B etween Intergroup Contact and Affective and Cogniti ve Dimensions of Prejudice.\" 60 determine whether the workshops had any effect on participants' political and soc ietal views. I was also curious whether the workshops would give participants a greater sense of pol itical efficacy so I included the last question on whether participants feel their opini on is heard by political leaders. Do you agree that refugees/IDPs from their group who fled the region during the conflict should return? Do you agree that the return of refugees/IDPs to the region will cause violenc e? Do you agree that people should keep weapons in their homes in case they need them? Do you agree that violence/intimidation is a way to get what you want? Do you believe reconciliation between groups is important? Do you feel your opinion is heard and respected by political leaders? Conclusion As research continues to weaken the link between reconciliation and the traditiona l transitional justice mechanisms of prosecutions and truth-telling,147 social psychological work on intergroup contact may offer a promising alternative with far reaching implicat ions for peacebuilding practitioners.148 However, limitations in existing social psychological research require additional i nquiry in order to provide answers to many of the most pressing questions regarding the resolution of vi olent 147 Mendeloff, \"Trauma and vengeance: Assessing the ps ychological and emotional effects of post-conflict justice.\"; O'Connell, \"Gambling with the psyche: Does prosecut ing human rights violators console their victims?.\" ; Thoms, Ron, and Paris, \"The effects of transitional justic e mechanisms: A summary of empirical research findi ngs and implications for analysts and practitioners.\"; Brou n\u00e9us, \"The trauma of truth telling: Effects of essing in the Rwandan gacaca courts on psychological health.\" 148 Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup forgiveness and guilt in Northern Ireland: Social psychological dimensio ns of 'The Troubles'.\"; Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup Contact, Ireland.\"; Pettigrew Te st of Intergroup Contact Theory.\" 61 conflict including, How can we create the conditions for reconciliation in post-confl ict societies? How can reconciliation be conceptualized and measured? What role can intergroup conta ct play in promoting reconciliation and supporting sustainable peace? This dissertation therefore contributes to building a theory of reconciliation b y consolidating scholarship from a range of disciplines including political science, law, poli tical and social psychology, into a theoretical framework in which the effect of various proposed i nterventions can be operationalized and tested. It then uses a field experimental methodology to test one part of the theory--the effects of intergroup contact on reconciliation, as measured by the dependent variables prejudice, empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness and healing. Cha pter 3 will discuss the study methodology in detail. 62 CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY This chapter will discuss the methodology used to test the hypothesis that dialog ue-based intergroup contact can promote reconciliation in post-conflict societies. It wi ll discuss the field experimental methodology used to identify the causal impact of facilitate d intergroup contact on theoretically meaningful proxies for reconciliation. These include prejudic e, empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness and healing, which have been drawn from literature i n various disciplines including political science, law, political and social psychology. Before ex plaining the methods used in this study, section one will first provide a brief overview of the concept of f ield experimentation, highlighting the potential of this methodology to answer some of the mos t challenging causal questions faced by social scientists and peacebuilding practitioners. Section two will explain the study design, section three will explain the various components of implementing the study including selection of facilitators, partners and parti cipants, and section four will conclude with an in depth look at the content of the workshops. Field Experimentation Field experimentation is a rapidly growing form of social science resea rch that encompasses hundreds of studies on topics like education, crime, employment, savings, discriminati on, charitable giving, conservation and political participation.149 It has long been employed as a methodology to answer key questions regarding health, education, agriculture and more recently development economics.150 However, field experimentation remains relatively uncharted 149 Alan S. Gerber and Donald Green, Field Experiments: Design, Analysis and Interpretat ion (New York: W.W. Norton, 2012), 15. 150 Macartan Humphreys and Jeremy M. Weinstein, \"Field Experiments and the Political Economy of Development,\" Annual Review of Political Science 12(2009). 63 territory for social scientists and practitioners seeking to implement i nterventions that change political processes.151 As deRooij, Green and Gerber note, one of the key challenges in social science is t o measure causal effects accurately. 152 Field experiments, randomized trials conducted in a naturalistic setting, attempt to approximate as closely as possible the conditions under which a c ausal process occurs. The interventions are similar or identical to the interventions s ubjects would experience in everyday life, and the outcome measures are the behavioral or insti tutional consequences of real-world significance. 153 In the contentious world of causal claims, randomized experimentation represents an evenhanded method for assessing what w orks. 154 The key to field experimentation is the random allocation of subjects to treatment. R andom allocation, a process by which units of analysis are assigned to experimental groups with equal probability, is the dividing line that separates experimental from non-experim ental research. 155 The goal of field experimentation is to control assignment to treatment, insofa r as possible, such that treated and untreated units are identical except that one group receives the tr eatment while the other does not. 156 The procedure of assigning treatments at random ensures that there is no systematic tendency for either the treatment or control group to have an adv antage. This implies that the observed and unobserved factors that affect outcomes are equally likely to be present in the treatment and control groups. 157 151 Ibid. 152 Eline A. deRooij, Donald Green, and Alan S.

Contrary to the relatively nea t science of laboratory experiments, field experiments confront practitioners with the dis tinct challenges of operating in foreign cultures and languages, and highly charged political envi ronments often fret with bureaucratic obstacles and corruption that comingle with intimidation and viole nce. These realities make implementing tightly designed randomized field experime nts a significant challenge. As such, this chapter will describe the methodology used in conducting this study and will acknowledge where political realities faced during implementation required a daptations to the original experimental design. I will discuss how these challenges were add ressed and where appropriate, I will suggest ways of overcoming these obstacles in future experi ments. This chapter concludes that while field experimentation in post-conflict societies will continue to pose 158 L. Savedoff et al., \"When will we ever learn?

Study Design This study used a randomized field experimental design to test the hypothe sis that dialogue- based contact could reduce prejudice and increase empathy, trust, tolerance, forgive ness and healing in a post-conflict context. 108 participants who identified as either me mbers of or sympathizers with one of the two major combatant groups in the Central Highlands reg ion of Aceh, GAM and PETA, were randomly assigned to one of nine treatment groups that i ncluded three training-based workshop groups, three dialogue-based workshop groups and thre e control groups in which respondents did not participate in any workshops. The three control groups were designed to shadow the three rounds of workshop groups such t hat one control group would be tested during the week that the first dialogue and training workshops were ongoing; the second control group would be tested during the week that the second dialogue and training workshops were ongoing; and the third control group would be tested during the week that the third dialogue and training groups were ongoing. However, as described below, the enumerators encountered problems finding all of the control group partici pants in their villages during the specified weeks so ultimately we lumped all control group respondents into a single control group that was tested during the three week workshop period and use d a single control group (labeled group 9) to control for all workshop groups. As no major exogenous events occurred during the three week workshop period, we consider this sufficie nt to control for the workshop groups. 66 Participant selection: There were two stages of participant identification in this study. First, through lengthy discussions with the local NGO partner that began in December 2010, a list of villages was identified that would at once be home to significant numbers of GAM a nd/or PETA members/sympathizers while being geographically accessible to NGO st aff given budget limitations. Ultimately, we selected the 13 villages shown below based on the fol lowing criteria: The head of the village was willing to participate in the program; We were able to identify participants who met the study criteria in those vil lages; Staff of the local NGO had previous experience working in these villages or specifi c knowledge of the political make-up of the village; The village was located in a sub-district that received a low ranking on the Conflict Intensity Index developed by the Aceh Reintegration Agency (BRA).161 We selected this criteria not because we thought the workshops wouldn't work in other mor e high intensity villages, but rather to keep the selection criteria unif orm. In addition, staff felt that the commanders or higher-ups in the respective chains of command of GAM and PETA were located in sub-districts with low intensity rankings as these villages often served as bases for planning attacks on higher intensity villages fur ther away from command centers, but did not often come under attack. As such, we decid ed to prioritize lower intensity villages in order to target a larger pool of ex- combatants within the chain 161 The conflict intensity index was developed in 2006 with technical assistance from the World Bank and other partners as part of the design and development of t he Community-Based Assistance for Conflict Victims program. It categorizes 227 rural sub-districts in Aceh into th ree categories of conflict intensity (high, medium and low) based on nine indicators drawn from various government da ta sources including: the Social Welfare Department 's number of conflict victims for 2002, 2003 and 2004 respect ively; the Indonesian military's information on con flict intensity; estimates of GAM returnees from the Aceh Monitoring Mission (AMM and the World Bank); data on politica l prisoner returnees from the International Organizat ion for Migration (IOM); 2005 GAM-GoI conflict inci dents from the World Bank's newspaper dataset; and World Bank surveys on perceptions of conflict that pre-date th e MoU. 67 of command rather than villages with higher intensity conflict that are home to more conflict-affected civilians than ex-combatants. We recognized that many villages in the Central Highlands would meet these c riteria, however due to budget limitations we could only select 108 participants. In addition, we were wor king with a limited transportation budget that restricted the distance staff wer e able to travel to conduct fieldwork. As a result, we selected villages that were located within appr oximately one hour of the provincial capital of Takengon. The benefit of this was that the relativel y close proximity of the villages selected increased the chances that participa nts would interact with each other following the workshops. Moreover, we had no reason to believe that the effect s of the workshops would be any different for participants in these villages versus other low intensity conflict villages given similar socio-economic and demographic factors. 68 As both GAM and PETA members are hidden populations with no available sampling frame, participants were identified in each village through snowball sampling. Staff of the local NGO first visited the head of the village, explained that they were trying to identify participants for a peacebuilding program through which participants would come to Banda Aceh for a thre e-day training on conflict resolution, and asked for assistance identifying members of or sympathizers with either PETA or GAM to participate in the program. In the district of Bener Meriah, several village heads declined to participate in the program as we were not able to secur e a letter of support from the head of the district ( Bupati ) due to demands for an exorbitant bribe. Because the head of the district in Bener Meriah is a known PETA leader who has maintained a n atmosphere of fear and intimidation throughout his political tenure, many within the di strict are Table 1: Village and Participant Selection No. Village Sub-District District Total Identifies w PETA Identifies w GAM Identifies w Other 1 Arul Kumer Aceh 8 1 7 4 Bies Aceh Tengah 2 1 1 5 Getting Ketol Aceh Tengah 6 4 2 6 Kalanareh 8 6 2 7 Karang 1 1 8 1 0 9 5 0 10 Tengah 1 1 0 11 Bener Meriah 15 0 15 107 43 63 1 TOTAL 69 afraid to act without his explicit support. As such, several village heads decline d to participate so the NGO staff concluded the process and went on to the next village. We felt that vi llages that declined to participate did not reflect those with greater intergroup tensions, but ra ther reflected a fear on the part of the head of village to act without the official sanction of the head of the district. Ultimately, the majority of villages selected were in the district of Central Aceh, where the various layers of government bureaucracy provided the necessary letter s of support through regular administrative procedures. In the event that the village head was willing to be of assistance, the staff sc heduled a time to come back to pick up the list of names of people who they would then interview using the firs t questionnaire (see Appendix B). Respondents received 25,000 Rupiah (approximately $3 US, slightly less than a daily wage for unskilled labor) for participation in the survey, which took an average of 25 minutes. Informed consent to participate in the study was obtained during this initial survey. On several occasions, the staff returned to find that the head of the village had alre ady gathered the people he had identified in his home or in a public meeting place in the village. In th ese cases, it was difficult for interviewers to get accurate informati on as people often gave politically correct responses rather than giving information about sensitive topics in public. T he staff also found that many times the village head had identified his friends and family (likel y because of the monetary compensation), rather than members of or sympathizers with GAM or P ETA. In the case that the respondent appeared to be a potential study participant, the int erviewers attempted to conduct a follow-up interview at a later time at the person's home. In cases where the respondent was clearly not a target for the study, the interviewer politel y completed the interview, but the respondent was not selected for participation in the program. In t otal, 171 70 interviews were conducted before we were able to identify 108 participants w ho met the study criteria. The 108 participants were selected based on the criteria of membership in or sym pathizing with GAM or PETA. We initially intended to include an additional criteria of a score of 15 or higher on the prejudice scale, but realized early on that some people were not entirely hone st given that they were being interviewed by someone they didn't know and had no reason to trust. As such, we were suspicious that people were underreporting the extent of their prejudice and ultimately decided to accept responders with membership in one of the target identity groups and a minimum score of 11 on the prejudice scale. Randomization: The randomization procedure was originally designed to assign participants to treatment groups after all 108 participants were identified. However, give n that the unanticipated difficulties explained below with identifying study participants from a hid den population threatened to prolong the project timeline such that significant additional cost s would have been incurred, we decided to execute the randomization procedure in three phases. When the first 36 participants were identified, they were randomly assigned t o the first three groups (dialogue, training and control) and the workshops began. 162 While this first phase was being implemented, staff from the local NGO partner continued to identify partic ipants. When the next 36 participants were identified, they were randomly assigned to the next thr ee groups and the second round of workshops took place. Phase three was completed when the final 36 participants were identified and randomly assigned to the final three groups. In t his way, we 162 I randomly assigned participants by going down the list and allocating every third person to one of t he groups. As I was not familiar with any of the participants, I considered this random allocation. 71 were able to compensate for unexpected challenges in identifying partici pants, and implement the program on time and budget. In hindsight, I would have allocated more time and money for participant selectio n. If the experiment were repeated, I would allow approximately three months to identify participants, instead of the one month allocated in this experiment, in order that all 108 participants could be identified before they were assigned to treatment or control groups. Additionally , I have since learned that a better way to implement my randomization procedure such that my randomization procedure would be easily replicable by other researchers would be to use a sta tistics package to to generate a random number for each subject. I would then sort all subjects in a scending order and finally assign them randomly to treatment and control groups.163 Challenges with participant selection: Two significant problems occurred during the process of participant selection. The first was that we initially tried to identify 54 p articipants who identified with GAM and the same number who identified with PETA. When we randomly assigned people to groups, we thought we had achieved this. However, it turned out that approximately 10 of the people selected for participation in the study said they id entified with PETA in the initial interview, but when they arrived at the workshop, it turned out that they were members of or sympathizers with GAM. In at least three of these cases, people explained that they had once identified with PETA, but had become angry at the group for various reas ons following the peace agreement and were now GAM sympathizers. The other cases seem to be people who were afraid during the initial interview that the interviewer was actually a member of the intelligence community and was trying to trick him into divulging that he was an affiliate of GAM. When these people arrived at the workshops and realized they were in a safe spa ce, they 163 This process is suggested by Green and Gerber, p. 37. 72 reported their identity as GAM members. Because of these unanticipated proble ms, we wound up with unequal numbers of participants from GAM and PETA, with 63 people who identified with GAM and 43 who identified with PETA. To compensate for this, we included the identity group of the participant in our statistical analysis in order to determine if an d when the identity group of the participant influenced the outcome. This is further explained in Chapter Four , which covers data analysis. The number of participants in each workshop group is shown in Table 1 below: Table 1: Workshop Groups PETA GAM Other Total Group 1 Training 4 8 12 Group 2 Dialogue 5 6 1 12 Group 4 Training 5 7 12 Group 5 Dialogue 5 7 12 Group 7 Mixed Methods 2 8 10 Group 8 Mixed Methods 4 11 15 Group 9 Control 18 16 34 TOTAL 43 63 1 107 The second problem was that one of the senior staff at the local NGO turned out to be corrupt and was caught conducting the first interview with GAM or PETA members, splitti ng the fee with them and making a deal that a third person, who may or may not have had a group affiliation, would attend the workshop instead of the group member himself. The scam was tha t the third person would report to the workshop using the member's name and then all three would split the workshop per diem. Unfortunately, we did not find out about this problem until the second workshop when we realized that the responses of two participants on the second sur vey did not match the responses they gave on the first survey. 73 Ultimately, a member of the local NGO staff uncovered the problem, the corrupt staff member was fired and any surveys he had done were rejected. We determined that this had not be en a problem in the first workshop and corrected the problem with the two participants in the s econd workshop by having the enumerators conduct the first demographic survey with the pe ople who were actually participating in the workshop so we had accurate demographics on the actual workshop participants. Ultimately, one of the two did not have a group affiliation. He cont inued to participate actively in the workshop, but we threw out his data when conducting data analy sis. While these challenges do not negate the results of the study, they introduce an addit ional source of bias that may affect the precision of the results. I acknowledge these sources of bias here in order that future research can anticipate the myriad challenges inherent i n conducting field experiments in conflict-affected settings and adjust for these problems in th e design phase. Finally, it is important to note that given the sensitive nature of the program, m any layers of management and bureaucracy had to be navigated before the team could enter the vi llages. Letters of support were received from the district police, military and ma yor's offices and verbal clearance was given by the commanders of the respective combatant groups. The se negotiations were an extremely challenging part of the program that required ongoing negotiations at different phases of the project and repeatedly threatened the success of the program. H owever, skillful negotiation on the part of the local NGO ensured the program was able to proceed. I mplementing contact programs on a provincial or national scale with authorization and direction from the Governor or President's office would help avoid this problem in the future. However, as s een through the experience described above, working with a government agency (in this case the BRA) posed its own political and public relations challenges. Ultimately, naviga ting the political 74 and security environment will be an unavoidable challenge for all intergroup contact programs and time should be built into program timelines and budgets to manage unanticipated obstacle s. Measurement: Each subject participated in a total of three interviews throughout the study. An initial interview was conducted in the subject's village in the Central Highl ands, which collected basic demographic information about the subjects' experience during the conflict , current experiences, identity group and an initial measure of prejudice. As explained in t he section above on participant selection, the measure of prejudice was used to select participa nts for the study. None of the other dependent variables were measured in the first survey. The Engli sh version of survey 1 is included in Appendix A. For those assigned to the dialogue or training treatment groups, the second intervi ew was conducted when the participants arrived at the workshop site the day before the workshops began. The third interview was also conducted at the workshop site immediately follow ing the conclusion of the workshops. Surveys two and three included measures of all of the depende nt variables\u2014prejudice, empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness and healing. The English version of surveys two and three is provided in Appendix B. For those assigned to the control group, the second and third surveys were conducted in their respective villages. Enumerators tried to interview the first twelve peopl e in the control group during the week of the first training and dialogue workshops; the second group of twe lve during the week of the second training and dialogue workshops; and the third group of twelve during t he week that the third training and dialogue were conducted. However, in some cases, pa rticipants were not available during that week and the interviews were conducted shortly ther eafter. 75 Ultimately, all control group interviews were conducted within the month that the w orkshops were being implemented. The study enumerators consisted of twelve staff members from the local N GO partner (four full time and seven recruited as enumerators) who were responsible for conducting the fi rst interview and the interviews for the control group in the Central Highlands, as well as six i ndependently recruited enumerators based in Banda Aceh who conducted interviews two and three wit h participants at the workshop site. 164 As explained below in the section on selecting and training partners, I worked with enumerators from the local NGO to field test and revise the surveys for several weeks, and to ensure a common understanding of the consent form and survey questions . I then conducted a one-day training with the Banda Aceh enumerators to familia rize them with the project, the consent form and the questionnaires, which proved sufficient as the survey language had already been finalized and literacy and education levels were m uch higher than with the staff in Central Aceh. In a future experiment, I would attempt to reduce sources of bias by allocat ing more time and money to data collection for the third interview. This would allow enumerators to conduct t he third interview with participants from both the treatment and control groups in their villages after the workshops, meaning the same procedure would be used to collect data from both the treatment and control groups. As it is, my study is exposed to the fact that my tre atment effects may be overestimated as subjects may have experienced a sense of euphoria immediately following the trainings that may or may not last when they return to their villag es. Another way 164 The Banda Aceh-based enumerators included several PhD students at the local university and several pe ople who had previously worked as enumerators for the Red Cr oss. While the trainings were conducted comfortably in Indonesian, some participants were more comfortable being interviewed in Acehnese or Gayonese so we en sured that two of the enumerators spoke Gayonese and four spoke Acehnese. Generally, participants who prefer red Acehnese identified with GAM, while those who spoke Gayonese identified with both GAM and PETA. 76 of accounting for this would be to conduct follow up interviews with all subjects to deter mine if there is a difference in participant responses immediately following the t raining versus several months later. Partnership: The workshops were originally designed to be implemented in partnership with the Aceh Reintegration Agency (BRA), the agency established by the governor of Aceh to implement the peace agreement. I worked with the Chairman of the agency f or over a year to design the program and secure funding in BRA's 2010 budget. 165 The program was originally designed to begin with a training of facilitators and include 90 participants i n three groups of 30 people each. Each group was scheduled to meet three times for three days each tim e in order to test the effects of repeated contact. The first group would participate in three training sessions, the second group in three dialogue sessions, and the third group would not participate in any workshops and would serve as the control group. The program was designed such that the BR A office in the Central Highlands would assist with the logistics of participant s election and data collection. In December 2009, the Governor and parliament approved BRA's 2010 budget with approximately US $90,000 allocated to BRA's conflict resolution program. However, in April 2010, the newly elected parliament comprised for the first time o f a majority from the ex-combatant political party, Partai Aceh, pressured the Governor to r eplace the Chairman of the BRA with their own representative, who was not favorable to a program that brought together ex-combatants from both sides of the conflict. As will be explaine d below, the facilitators training was implemented in August 2010, but the new Chairman ultima tely shut down the program a month later and allocated the funds elsewhere. 165 The BRA is jointly funded by the central and provi ncial governments, and has served as the main vehic le for transferring over 200 million USD in reparations an d compensation payments to former combatants, amnes tied political prisoners and civilians affected by confl ict. 77 After a significant restructuring, the project was reincarnated in par tnership with a local NGO based in the Central Highlands, two independent facilitators and six independent enumer ators. It was finally implemented in early 2012 with a budget of $20,000 and the revamped design described above. The next section will describe how these partners were sele cted and trained, and how subjects were identified for participation in the study. Implementing the study This section will dissect the numerous components of the study that were necessar y to arrive at the final workshops. It will cover training and selecting the facilitators, the implementing partner and selecting study participants. Section four will describe the workshops thems elves in detail. Training and selecting facilitators: In August 2010, I co-facilitated a six-day workshop sponsored by the BRA on methods for facilitating intergroup contact. 166 The training was attended by thirty participants who were members of Aceh's professional fac ilitator's network, IMPACT. As members of IMACT, participants had previously been trained in fa cilitation techniques, and most had also been trained in techniques for facilitating community development. Nearly all had previous facilitation experience. My co-facilitator, Fajran Zain, is an intellectual leader in the activis t community in Aceh, and helped found the Aceh Institute, a prominent Aceh-based think-tank publishing opinion pieces and research on the Aceh peace process. He holds a master's degree in social ps ychology from Ball State University and was teaching conflict resolution at a universit y in Banda Aceh. As such, he was familiar with material on prejudice reduction and comfortable faci litating discussion about the Aceh peace process. 166 The first three days took place from August 18-20 and the second three days from August 24-26. 78 The training material was based on a conflict resolution manual I developed while working at the World Bank in Aceh in early 2011. The goal of the training was for the participants to understand the concept of reconciliation and develop a toolbox of techniques with which to facilitate reconciliation. The training focused on the techniques of storytelling and interactive problem-solving, both of which w ill be discussed in detail in section four on the implementation of the workshops. The facilitator's training had the following agenda: Day 1 9:00-10:30 Opening Introductions Goal of the workshop Workshop schedule BRA's 2010 Conflict Resolution Program 10:30-11:00 Break 11:00-12:30 What 12:30-1:30 Lunch/prayer 1:30-3:00 Understanding reconciliation 3:00-3:30 Break 3:30-4:00 Reflections on Day 1 Day 2 9:00-10:00 Recap of Day 1 10:00-10:30 Break 10:30-12:00 How can we overcome prejudice?

We said t hat the essence of reconciliation was about fostering psychological change such t hat prejudice is reduced, while trust, tolerance and empathy are increased. However, through discussion with participants on the first day, we quickly came to realize that while participants understood this explanation, they had previously addressed the concept of reconciliation through the frame of transitional justice for two main reasons. First, the Aceh peace agreement frames reconciliation as a human rights provision that would be addressed through the transitional justice mechanisms of a Truth and Reconciliation Figure 3: Slide developed with participants to illustr ate their understanding of reconciliation. Figure 2: Original slides (translated into English) explainin g reconciliation 82 Commission and a Human Rights Court. Subsequently, bringing these bodies to fruition has be en the focus of NGO efforts to encourage reconciliation in Aceh. Second, as participants explained, they had been taught by organizations such as the International Center on Transit ional Justice (ICTJ), which has been actively engaged in bringing about these bodies, that t here are four components to transitional justice: truth-telling, justice, institutional ref orm and reparations. As such, they understood reconciliation through the lens of transitional justice. To reflec t our understanding of participants' notion of reconciliation, we developed the visual shown in Fig ure 3. We then developed a second slide that integrated this concept of reconciliation with the concept we were explaining. Figure 4 shows the resulting visual, which illustrates how intergroup contact can complement truth- telling, institutional reform, justice and reparations to produce the desired psychological changes that result in reconciliation. We found this more holistic concept resonated well with participants and agreed that we would teach the concept in t his way in future trainings. Additionally, the process of adapting the concept of reconciliation with partic ipants served the important function of trust-building between the facilitators and the participants . When we arrived at the training, we were met with a barrage of hostility from partic ipants that was directed Figure 4: Model of Reconciliation developed with parti cipants in facilitator's workshop 83 at the BRA and strongly affected the initial dynamics of the workshop. Two days be fore the workshop was scheduled to begin, IMPACT had come into confrontation with the BRA when IMPACT's Chairman requested a formal invitation to attend the training signe d by the Chairman of the BRA. When the Chairman of the BRA refused this request, IMPACT took the positi on that it would not send its members to the training. Through much backdoor diplomacy, IM PACT ultimately agreed to attend the training, but there was bad blood on both sides when the tra ining began. The tension between the two organizations was rooted in the perception on the part of the NG O community that the BRA had not done a satisfactory job of including NGO's and the activi st community in Aceh in planning and implementing reintegration programs, and that the proce ss had been unsatisfactory at best. This situation was aggravated by the fact that t he new BRA Chairman was appointed by Partai Aceh (PA), the political party repres enting the ex-combatant military structure, which had won a majority in parliament the previous year and w as perceived to be governing Aceh in an undemocratic manner that excluded participation from the ac tivist community. As such, participants had developed a long list of grievances toward the BR A, and Partai Aceh more generally, and were seeking recognition from the BRA a s a means of addressing the disenfranchisement they felt from the political process. As the training opened, these issues quickly came to the floor and dominated the initial sessions of the training. It took us several sessions to begin to diffuse this hostility and t o reassure the participants that as facilitators we were not representing BRA or PA, but ra ther were there to address the larger issue of building sustainable peace in Aceh. We did our best to rem ain calm as participants coldly received our initial material, and found our opening when we were able to bring some of the key leaders to the front of the room to share their concept of reconc iliation. As 84 we acknowledged their concept of reconciliation and worked through building a joint conce pt, the tension diffused and we were able to proceed in a constructive manner with the r est of the workshop. We returned to these issues at the end of the workshop with a session facilitate d by a senior official from the BRA that allowed participants to voice their concerns and recommendations directly to the BRA. At the end of the workshop, we passed around a sign-up sheet that gave participants the opportunity to express whether they were interested in facilitating the BRA workshops, and to note which method (storytelling, interactive problem-solving, or both) they felt comfortable facilitating. They were told that the BRA would then hold inte rviews to select those who would become the facilitators for the dialogues and trainings. Approxima tely half of all participants expressed an interest in facilitating these sessions. The majority of those who did not express interest said they were reluctant to work on behalf of the BRA, whi ch they felt could not guarantee their security during highly sensitive meetings between GAM and PETA representatives that had the potential to result in violence. Moreover, they were concerned that negative perceptions of the BRA in the field might jeopardize the success of the w orkshops. Selecting and training partners: Following the facilitators training, there were several months of negotiations before the BRA officially terminated its conflict resoluti on program. The Chairman of the BRA was ultimately fired by the Governor in December 2010, but the Deputy Chai rman 85 who took over as Chairman was under strong pressure from parliament to continue the policie s of the previous Chairman. As such, BRA became mired in political controversy, and conti nuing to work with the agency was no longer a constructive option. Instead, I decided to partner directly with two of the facilitators from the tra ining and a local NGO based in the Central Highlands to implement the workshops. In November 2010, I approached one of the facilitators who had shown the most interest in and potential to fac ilitate the techniques taught during the facilitators training to see if he would be will ing to partner with me to implement the workshops. He agreed, and brought on board the second facilitator. He a lso accompanied me on a week-long assessment to Central Aceh in December 2010 to eval uate potential partners and project sites. On this trip, he introduced me to a close friend and colleague who headed a local NGO with a respected reputation and significant experience wor king in conflict-affected communities in the highlands. After exploring several partnership options, including working directly with GAM a nd PETA commanders to implement the program, I ultimately decided to partner with the loca l NGO because 1. The NGO was viewed as neutral by both sides; 2. The NGO had previous experienc e implementing peacebuilding programs in highly conflict-affected communiti es that were home to both identity groups, which made it easier for them to approach community leaders; 3. T hey had strong political connections that would make it easier to garner the necessary pol itical support for the project; and 4. I felt that the close relationship between the facilitator s and the head of the NGO would help the facilitators understand the context the participants were comi ng from and 86 stay motivated despite concerns about security as they would be collaborating wi th and learning from a respected senior colleague. 167 Between December 2010 and March 2011, I worked closely with the facilitators to devel op the training manuals and slides that would guide the training-based and dialogue-base d workshops. Based on the training manual from the six-day facilitator's training, the fa cilitators produced an initial draft of the workshop material that integrated the concepts of storytel ling and interactive problem-solving with appropriate religious and spiritual concepts they felt would di ffuse tension between the participants as well as games and icebreakers to keep parti cipants relaxed and energetic. We worked through several iterations of this material until we fe lt confident with the final product. The results are presented in section four of this chapter, which explains the content of the workshops in detail. In March 2011, I returned to the Central Highlands for several weeks of training wit h the local NGO. By that time, they had selected four full-time staff to work on the proje ct and seven others to serve as enumerators. We spent several days going over the design of the st udy, ensuring everyone understood the objectives of the study and preparing a project timeline . We then spent several more days going over the informed consent form and the questionnaires, init ially reading through them together and correcting language that was unclear or concepts t hat required explanation. Once we agreed on the translations, staff then practiced interviewi ng other staff members, which was followed by another group session in which we revised the language a nd format of the questionnaires to ensure a common understanding and approach. We then did a dry run of the survey forms by having staff and enumerators interview 12 ex-combat ants who agreed to come into the office for the interviews. Following these interviews, we fi nalized the consent 167 To help ensure the security of the facilitators an d the local NGO staff, I have opted not to disclose their names. 87 form and questionnaires and determined that they were ready to begin recruiti ng participants in the field. The Workshops Figure 5: Banner welcoming participants, \"Welcome Pa rticipants of the Workshop for Peace. Together we can bu ild, maintain and safeguard peace.\" This section will discuss the workshops themselves, and will detail the methodologies used in the dialogue-based, training-based and mixed methods workshops. It will begin with an expla nation of the elements common to all workshops, then will describe the segments that were unique to each of the workshop techniques. Ultimately, the content of the workshops was handcrafte d by the facilitators by combining conflict resolution methodologies that were ta ught in the BRA- sponsored facilitator's training with locally appropriate notions of spirituali ty and religion. The workshops were therefore informed but not constrained by the methodologies of interact ive problem-solving (IPS),168 historical narrative/storytelling, 169 and general conflict resolution techniques such as negotiation and mediation. In general, the dialogue-based workshops were designed to create an intimate environment between the participants in which they had the opportunity to share their experie nces and learn from the perspectives of others. The storytelling component of the workshop was base d on the To Reflect and Trust (TRT) model developed by psychologist Dan Bar-On that w as used in 168 H.C. Kelman, \"Interactive Problem-Solving: A socia l-psychological approach to conflict i n Conflict: Reading in Management and Resolution , ed. John; Duke Burton, Frank (New York: St. Marti n's Press, 1990). 169 Albeck, Adwan, and Bar-On, \"Dialogue groups: TRT's guidelines for working through intractable conflict s by personal storytelling.\" 88 workshops between Jewish descendants of Holocaust survivors and German descendants of Na zi perpetrators. However, the workshops diverged from a traditional storytelling m ethodology following the storytelling sessions to combine elements of IPS in which partici pants identified the needs and fears of the other based on the stories they heard and tried to develop ways in which they could address these needs and fears. 170 In contrast, the training workshops were designed to teach participants skills that would be useful for resolving conflict w ithin their own communities and test the effects of a less intimate environment in which partic ipants are exposed to the other simply by learning together in the same classroom. The mixed method wor kshops combined both the storytelling and training models to test whether training immedi ately following storytelling might help participants resolve some of the emotions arous ed by the storytelling. Details of the workshops are explained below. Common elements of all workshops Transportation and arrival on Day 1: All participants travelled to Banda Aceh via a night bus from the Central Highlands. We used the night bus due to road construction that closed the road from the district capital, Takengon, to the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, sporadica lly during the day. Travelling at night also allowed participants to complete a full work day be fore departing. The bus left the highlands at approximately 10pm for the 7-10 hour journey down the mountain to Banda Aceh. A staff member of the local NGO accompanied participants on the bus , which made several bathroom, smoking and food stops along the way. Participants were provided 25,000 rupiah (US $3) each for meals on the one-way trip. 170 Ibid. 89 They arrived at the hotel in Banda Aceh around 6am and were assigned a room that was shared with two other participants. Rooms were mixed with participants from different identity groups wherever possible. Participants rested until the opening ceremony and lunch comme nced at 12:30. One of the facilitators was responsible for each opening ceremony in which par ticipants were welcomed and given the schedule and a brief overview of the next three days. T he interview process was also explained and the enumerators were introduced. Follow ing lunch, participants were interviewed one-on-one and dinner was provided that evening. The hotel w as several kilometers outside of town, so few participants left the workshop venue. Inst ead, many spent the afternoon chatting in the hotel or in the open air coffee shop next to the hotel. The facilitators: The workshops benefited tremendously from the skill and experience of two of Aceh's best facilitators, both of whom demonstrated an enormous amount of courage and dedication in accepting the risks inherently involved in this project. As these workshops we re the first of their kind in Aceh, there was much uncertainty about what would happen when ex- combatants from different parties came together. There was a risk that viole nce would occur or that the facilitators and organizers would come under scrutiny from the authoriti es given the political sensitivity of facilitating interaction between the parties. To manage some of these risks, the facilitators incorporated religious, spiritual and historical elements into the 90 workshops intended to diffuse tension between participants and foster a sense of common ground. As is common practice in Aceh, all workshops were opened and closed with prayer . In addition, the facilitators also added religious teachings that invoked a common sense of humanity and duty. For example, they discussed their interpretation of the Quranic passag e Al Fatiha as meaning to \" kasih sayang \" or give love and care to those around you. Similarly, they invoked passages from the religious teachings of the Hadith to discuss the role god intende d for humanity and to foster good will among participants. The facilitators also used the notion of \" rukun Islam ,\" the community of Islam, to invoke a sense of solidarity among participants. The flipchart picture to the left shows a drawing done by the facilitators in the shape of a mosque to represent their interpretation of the pillars or foundational concepts of Islam. The four large vertical pillars read \"justice, forgiv eness, love and unity.\" The seven horizontal pillars read economy, education, health, politics, s ecurity, etc.\" Finally on top are just and prosperous people who are created by god. Facil itators reminded participants that they were all part of the community of Islam, which serve d not only to evoke a sense of common ground but also to establish a sense of proper decorum for the workshops. The history of Aceh was also used as a way to connect participants to a broader sense of a shared past rather than focusing only on the recent history of several decades of conflict. The facilitators discussed the history of Aceh, reminding participants of Aceh's historic role as a crossroads for people of all nations. The attached flipchart shows a \"History Tree,\" reminding participants that the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) began in 1976, but that the various ethnicities and regions of Aceh (Gayo, Perlak, Pase, etc.) were uni ted hundreds 91 of years earlier under Aceh's great sultan Iskandar Muda. They used a fam iliar acronym in Aceh using the old spelling of \"Atjeh\" with the A for Arab, T for Turkey, J for German, E for Europe, and H for India to remind participants that Aceh has a long tradition of multicultur alism, acceptance and inclusion of others. In addition, the facilitators drew on lessons they had learned from motivational spea king, incorporating inspirational vignettes designed to help participants refle ct on their attitudes and state of mind. For example, one slide read \"If we are able to erase thoughts of im possibility, our potential will flow like water.\" Another read \"If we think we can't, then we wil l automatically look for the truth in this way of thinking that we have planted. The actions we take will the refore be the result of the impossibility we created ourselves.\" The facilitators c ombined these phrases with energizers and games designed to inspire and motivate participants. For example, they would ask for a volunteer, have him sit in a chair and hold his arm out straight. They would then ask him to think of a bad experience and push his arm down, which proved easy when he was thinking negative thoughts. They would then ask the participant to think of a positive exper ience and show that his arm was much stronger and resistant to their force when he was thinki ng positive thoughts. Facilitators also frequently had participants on their feet for exercises or games that kept people motivated and energized. These religious, spiritual, historic and motivational approaches set a tone of coope ration and solidarity between participants from the beginning of the workshops that helped diffuse m uch of 92 the initial tension and provided a strong platform from which to discuss reconciliati on. The commitment and skill of the facilitators was surely a key factor to the s uccess of the workshops. Their creativity, enthusiasm, knowledge and courage made this study possible. Informal Time: Throughout the four days that participants attended the workshop, informal time was very important. Participants shared meals and rooms together, and many cups of coffee in the open air coffee shop next door to the hotel. Hotel rooms frequently became gathering places for late night discussions, as men in Aceh have a tradition of staying up until the wee hours of the morning drinking coffee, smoking cigarettes, and often talking polit ics. For many participants, this was a rare opportunity to get to know members of the outgroup in a n informal setting, and seemed to have a significant impact on participant perceptions of both the workshop and the outgroup. Introductions: A similar technique was used in all workshops to facilitate participant introductions. Each person was asked to write his name, assigning one word that describes a characteristic of the participant to each letter of his name. Participants were also asked to write or draw something that represents their strengths, fears and the expectations they feel others have of them. The picture below shows a participant who identified his strength as peace, his fear as a retur n to war and the expectation others have of him as providing comfort such as a home. 93 Ground Rules: Following introductions, all workshops asked participants to identify ground rules for the sessions. Groups frequently identified drinking, asking questions, discussi ng, speaking and praying as allowable, and smoking, fighting, making fun of people and br inging weapons, sharp objects or bombs as prohibited. Reconciliation: At the beginning of all workshops, the facilitators explained that the workshops would emphasize the importance of reconciliation. They acknowledged that thirt y years of conflict had left a legacy of anger, hate and violence between groups that would not serve Aceh well in building a better future. Facilitators explained their view of reconc iliation as repairing relations between groups such that people no longer view members of the other group as the enemy, or harbor suspicion toward their intentions and actions. They explained that reconciliation is about reestablishing trust in order that conflicts could be resolve d through dialogue rather than violence when they occur. They acknowledged the different identity groups in the room and clarified that the workshop intended to give people an opportunity to interact with and get to know members of the other group with whom they might not otherwise have the opportunity to interact. They discussed how years of conflict had often led to negative perceptions about the other and segregation such t hat people from different groups rarely had meaningful personal interactions. They explained how when conflicts occurred, this lack of interaction often led people to assume the worst and turn to violence, rather than communicating with members of the other group to clarify inte ntions and actions and resolve disputes through negotiation. As such, they stressed the importanc e of intergroup contact and getting to know members of the other group for improving relati ons between groups in Aceh and ultimately ensuring sustainable peace. 94 Visioning: All workshops ended with a session on visioning. Participants worked in groups of 4- 6 to develop answers to the following questions: 1) What do you hope life will be like ten yea rs from now? 2) What needs to happen to achieve that vision? 3) What needs to happen to strengthen intergroup relations in your community? 4) Identify who in your comm unity (person, group or organization) is supporting peace and how. After the first few workshops, we observed that many of the groups were drawi ng village maps like the two shown below that showed visions of better roads, an airport, coffee factor ies, cell towers, etc. In the debriefing sessions that were held between me and the facilitators a fter each workshop, we discussed ways of moving the visioning sessions away from a focus on visions of community development toward a deeper conversation about what needs to happen to improve intergroup relations in the communities of the Central Highlands. As such, in later workshops, facilitators asked participants to give recommendat ions for concrete actions that could be taken by participants, the government or other actors to improve i ntergroup relations. However, while it seemed that participants understood the importance of i mproving intergroup relations, they found it difficult to translate this understanding into ideas about what they could do to improve intergroup relations. For example, many participants said that NGOs 95 should continue to hold these intergroup workshops so that a majority of the population had a chance to participate. Others placed responsibility on BRA for implementing repa rations in a more transparent and fair manner. Still others felt it was the responsibility of the government to eradicate \"money politics\" and corruption in order that the highlands could become more democratic. Few participants put forward ideas about how, as individuals, they could build on what they learned in the workshops to improve relations between groups within their own communitie s. We agreed that it was important that participants see themselves as change agents or actors in reconciliation. We therefore decided that in future workshops, we would alter the rec onciliation material slightly to give examples of individual efficacy in repairing intergroup relations and suggest ways participants might share their workshop experience with their communities. The Training-based Workshops In addition to the elements common to all workshops described above, the training-base d workshops included material on perceptions and prejudice, understanding conflict, communication skills, negotiation and mediation, all of which will be described in deta il below. The training workshops had the following agenda.

The facilitators explained to participants that prejudice is a negative attitude toward a pers on or group that manifests as negative bel feelings or actions toward an individual or group. 171 They explained that prejudice often leads people to assume the worst of others, thinking \"the y\" have bad intentions and are not acting in good faith, and therefore reject their perspective as wrong or irrational. As such, the goal of the session was to help partic ipants understand that people often interpret the same situation differently and that these diffe rences in perception often frustrate communication and cause conflict to escalate. If we und erstand that people come from different backgrounds and experiences that inform their perce ptions and prejudices, and that perceptions that differ from our own are not necessarily wrong, we can avoid miscommunication and peacefully resolve conflicts as the y occur. To illustrate the point, the facilitators showed the following picture and asked participants to identif y what they thought was happening in the scene, how many objects or people they see, and whi ch objects are the tallest and shortest. As expected, participants described the scene diffe rently, with explanations ranging from a girl sitting at a table looking at a painting of a scene of women to a grou p of udice and intergroup hostility.\" 97 Following the session on reconciliation, the traini ng workshops he facilitators explained to participants that prejudice is a negative attitude toward a pers on or group that manifests as negative bel iefs, They explained that prejudice often leads people to assume the worst of others, thinking \"the y\" have bad intentions and are not acting in As such, the goal of the session was to help partic ipants understand that people often interpret the same situation differently and that these diffe rences in perception often frustrate erstand that people come from different backgrounds and experiences that inform their perce ptions and prejudices, and that perceptions that differ from our own are not necessarily wrong, we can avoid miscommunication and y occur.

As expected, participants described the scene diffe rently, with explanations ranging from a girl sitting at a table looking at a painting of a scene of women to a grou p of 98 sculptors putting the finishing touches on a large bust. Facilitators then asked part icipants how they felt when they first saw the picture, how they figured out what the picture w as, what influenced their perceptions, if they could see the picture from the perspective of others and what lessons they learned from this experience. They drove home the point that people have di fferent perceptions of the same thing given their different backgrounds and experiences, ev en when they are all working toward the same goal, which in this case was to identify wha t was going on in the picture. As such, they stressed that it is important to consider the different pers pectives of others when resolving conflict. Understanding conflict: This session sought to contextualize participants as agents of peace in their villages who could help resolve conflicts as they arise. As such, the fa cilitators explained that it is important for participants to have a strong understanding of the factors c ausing the conflict before deciding on a course of action, and focused on basic conflict analysis t ools to help participants analyze conflict. 172 They asked participants for an example of a conflict that took place in their village and used this to illustrate a stakeholder analysis in w hich participants identified the various primary (the parties in conflict) and secondary (people w ho may have become involved in the conflict or are necessary to resolve it such as village heads or religious leaders) actors to the story, and their role in the conflict. They then worked through an example of a problem tree to help participants identify the root and proximate causes of the conf lict. Communication skills: This session focused on nonverbal communication and active listening skills. 173 The facilitators showed a short video of two men arguing with the sound off and asked 172 Wahjudin UNDP, and The Centre for Conflict Resoluti on, Skills development for conflict transformation: A training manual on understanding conflict, negotiat ion and mediation , ed. Conflict Management Capacity Building 99 participants to comment on what was going on in the video based on the body language the y observed. They later asked participants to break into groups of two and have one person tell a story about something that was very important to them. The listener was firs t instructed to do a poor job of active listening, which was followed by a group discussion of what actions indi cated the person was not listening actively. The listener was then instructed to do an exc ellent job of active listening, which was also followed by a group discussion of what actions indic ate good listening skills. Participants were reminded to bring these skills to the follow ing sessions on negotiation and mediation. Negotiation: In this session, facilitators emphasized that negotiation is a normal part of dai ly interactions such as meeting with family members and neighbors, marketing or a ttending village meetings. They stressed that negotiation is a skill that can be learned and tha t the most successful negotiations result in win-win solutions. They explained the difference between posi tions and interests and used the story of the father splitting the orange between two d aughters from Roger Fisher's Getting to Yes to illustrate how participants can ask \"Why is this i mportant to you\" in order to better understand the underlying interests of the person with whom they are negotiating. 174 Participants then participated in a two-person role play that I developed f or a negotiation training that had been conducted by BRA the previous year as part of its peace education progra m in which Zul was a young man who had purchased a piece of land from Meli, who had sold it under duress after her husband died to support her four children. Zul was now planning to get marri ed Project of the United Nations Department of Economi c and Social Affairs and Division for Public Admini stration and Development Management (Available at http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documen ts/un/unpan001363.pdf), 23-31. 174 Roger; Ury Fisher, William, Getting to yes: Negotiating agreement without givin g in , ed. Bruce Patton (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1991). 100 and needed money to support his sick mother in law so he was selling the house. Meli, anxious t o get her family land back and have an extra room for her now 13 year old daughter, made a low offer on the house. Zul became angry because he felt that he told Meli he was se lling the house to get married and instead of saying congratulations, she made an offensively low offer. Zul felt that he had paid more than what the land was worth when he purchased it to help Meli due to her difficult circumstances. Subsequently, he thought it only right that she now try to hel p him when he was in need. Zul also knows that it will be difficult to find another buyer for the house because the only access to the house is via Meli's land. She has been kind enough to let him par k there all these years, but he is worried that he will not find another buyer who is willing to put up with this arrangement. The two have had excellent relations until this point, but ex changed some unfortunate words as both were stressed and frustrated. They are now meeting to disc uss the situation. After participants negotiated, the facilitators asked the group to explain t he solutions they negotiated. They then worked with the group to identify the positions and interests of both Zul and Meli. The take home point was that if you can understand the underlying interest of t he person or group you are negotiating with, you can devise win-win solutions that me et the needs of both parties. Mediation: This session explained that mediation is negotiation with the assistance of a thi rd party. 175 Facilitators discussed the role of a mediator as a person who remains neutra l, does not take sides with either party, and helps the parties identify their options and choose the best one. 175 Saadia Touval and I. William Zartman, \"Mediation i n Theory,\" in International Mediation in Theory and Practice , ed. Saadia Touval and I. William Westview, Dean G. Pruitt, \"Mediator Behavior and Success in Mediation,\" in Studies in International Mediation , ed. Jacob Bercovitch (New York, NY: Palgrave MacMillan, 2002); Christopher W. Moore, The Mediation Process: Practical Strategies for Resolving Conflict , vol. Third Edition (San Fransisco: Jossey-Bass, 2 003). 101 They conducted a simulation in which participants were split into groups of three to f our, with each group representing one village council. Two mediators were also identif ied who represented sub-district level officials. The scenario was one that participants were quite familiar with in which the government had identified several villages located far from the new road f or relocation closer to the road. In theory, people from these villages supported this relocation, as be ing closer to the road would make selling products like coffee and rubber much easier. However, afte r the government identified the new locations, conflict broke out between villages over which vi llage would get the best spot along the road, which was not only the most strategically lo cated, but also the closest to a water source. The dispute had become quite intense, with threat s of violence occurring regularly between villages and youth who had begun to set up road blocks to neighboring villages that were causing the situation to escalate. It w as the job of the mediators to help the three village councils work through this problem and reach an acceptable sol ution if possible. If a solution could not be reached, the decision would be brought before the head of t he sub-district for final arbitration. While the village councils prepared their positions and interests, the facilitat ors briefed the mediators, instructing them in the following procedure: 1) give an opening statem ent welcoming the participants, explaining the procedure that would be followed, and that as the media tor, they would help the participants to reach an acceptable agreement, but would not make decisi ons on their behalf; 2) ask the parties for their consent to participate in the mediation a nd agree on a time frame; 3) Ask each party for their opening statement and try to refr ame back to them the issues and interests they have identified; 4) Clarify the issues that will be discussed by producing an agenda; 5) Facilitate a discussion on each agenda item and try to help participant s identify 102 options for solutions; 6) If they reach agreement on an issue, help them write up the detai ls of that agreement. Following the simulation, the facilitators debriefed the session with the part icipants, asking about the solutions they had reached and what they had learned about the role of the mediator. The Dialogue-based Workshops In addition to the common elements described above, the dialogue-based workshops included t he following: Day 1 06:00-07:00 Arrive at hotel; rest 12:30-14:00 Opening, Lunch 14:00-17:00 Interviews 19:00 Dinner Day 2 08.30-010:30 Opening, Introductions and Ground Rules What is Reconciliation?

They explained that storytelling had been used by people experiencing conflict i n many areas of the world including between Palestinians and Israeli's, Germans and Jews, Tur ks and Armenians, etc. as a means of increasing understanding between groups. They explained tha t the format for storytelling in which each participant would get 20 minutes to respond to any or all of the following questions: Explain your perceptions and feelings about the other group? Have you had personal experiences (either good or bad) with members of the other group? What did your parents or family members teach you about members of the other group when you were little? Do you trust the other group? Why or why not? What is your perception about relations between groups in Aceh today? We chose these questions to orient participants toward thinking about relations between groups today. As expected, we found that they evoked many difficult stories a bout negative and often violent interactions with members of the other group during the conf lict coupled with strong feelings of distrust today. While many participants were quite vocal and could have continued well past their 20 minutes, others were more reserved and require d more assistance from 176 Albeck, Adwan, and Bar-On, \"Dialogue groups: TRT's guidelines for working through intractable conflict s by personal storytelling.\" 105 facilitators, who skillfully asked open-ended questions such as \"C an you say more about that?\" or \"How did that experience make you feel?\" to encourage participants. This individual storytelling was followed by 10 minutes for the group t o ask questions that clarified anything the speaker said or comment on how they felt w hen hearing the story. Facilitators were firm that this was not time to dispute f acts or advocate partisan perspectives, but rather time to better understand the perspective of the speaker. They consistently reminded participants that the point of storytelling was to understand the spea ker, not to engage in a debate about facts or issues. For the facilitators, storytelling was the most taxing portion of the workshop, as they reflected that they had to be fully engaged with each participant and constantly creative in asking questions and framing participant experiences in the context of improving group understanding of the experiences of others. In large part due to their skill in introducing and facilitating these sessions, storytelling remained free of violence and stayed f ocused on understanding the perspective of others. Facilitators initially expressed anxiety about facilitating the storytelling workshops, and chose to begin the workshops with a training-based workshop to give them time to assess the interaction and level of tension between participants. However, following the first dialogue-ba sed workshop, facilitators expressed how surprised they were at the power of storytelling and how successful it had been in creating an intimate environment and meaningful interaction between the participants. As their confidence grew following the second dialogue-ba sed workshop, they began advocating for integrating storytelling into the last two w orkshops, creating mixed-method workshops that included storytelling sessions. Given their strong fe elings about the beneficial 106 effects of the storytelling workshops, we decided to revise the for mat for the last two workshops, which were intended to be a training-based and a dialogue-based works hop. Instead, we implemented two mixed methodology workshops that combined storytelling and training techniques. The last section will discuss the agenda for the mix ed-method workshops that resulted. Needs and fears, visioning and recommendations: Drawing upon the notion from human needs theory that all human beings have innate, insuppressible, non-negotiable ontological needs such as acknowledgment, recognition, autonomy and dignity that are precondi tions for individual development, 177 interactive problem-solving posits that conflict is caused not only by divergent interests, but is also a process driven by collective needs and fe ars. 178 When these needs are not met, conflict takes on an existential dimension, turning the conflict into a struggle over group survival, and often frustrating conflict resolution efforts based sole ly on models of negotiation and consensus building. As originally designed, interactive problem-solving includes sessions in which par ticipants identify their collective needs and fears. However, during the facilita tor's workshop, we found that this concept did not resonate with participants in Aceh and that they had much confusion trying to identify collective needs and fears. Rather than get bogged down in replica ting the interactive problem-solving methodology, we adapted the concept such that it would fit w ith storytelling and resonate with participants. As such, the session following st orytelling asked participants to identify the challenges each group faced in improving intergroup r elations and what each group would need to overcome these challenges. We found that even this version of 177 John Burton, Conflict: Resolution and Provention (New York: St. to conflict resolution.\" 107 \"needs and fears\" was a bit abstract for participants, and the notion of identify ing challenges for improving intergroup relations was easier to grasp. As such, participants identified challenges such as a lack of opportunity to interact with members of the other group, lack of formal communication between the groups, lack of transparency on the part of the Aceh Reintegration Agency (BRA) in administering reintegration aid, lack of attention to the Central Highlands region from the provincial governmen t, etc. Identifying these challenges made it easier for participants to enter into vis ioning and make recommendations for improving intergroup relations, sessions that lasted longer in the dial ogue-based workshops than in the training-based or mixed-methods workshops. While this session on \"needs and fears\" helped transition the works hop from storytelling to sessions on visioning and recommendations, we were left with the impression that i t was difficult for participants to conceptualize themselves as having agency in c hanging the larger political system that is sustaining conflict in Aceh, and as such difficult to conceptualize what their group would need to affect change in relations between groups. In future worksh ops, it might be more constructive to focus this session on obstacles that exist to impr oving intergroup relations in the Central Highlands, rather than asking specifically about the challenges and ne eds of each group. The Mixed-method Workshops The content of the mixed-method workshops was similar to that of the dialogue workshops f or the first one and a half days. However, following the storytelling sessions, the fa cilitators shifted back toward the methodology for the training workshop with sessions on understanding confl ict, negotiation and a short mediation simulation. This differs from the dialogue-base d workshops, which resolved the storytelling sessions with sessions on challenges for improvi ng intergroup 108 relations and identifying the needs of each group. The agenda for the mixed-met hod sessions follows: Day 1 06:00-07:00 Arrive at hotel; rest 12:30-14:00 Opening, Lunch 14:00-17:00 Interviews 19:00 Dinner Day 2 08.30-10:30 Opening, Introductions and Ground Rules What is Reconciliation?

This c hapter has identified the methodology used to implement this study, and has tried to acknowledge the weaknesses of the randomization procedure where they exist in order that readers can take into account t he possible effects on outcomes that will be discussed in chapters four and five, and perhaps most importantly, correct for these shortcomings in future studies. I have also tri ed to detail the treatments such that they can be replicated by other researchers and prac titioners in the future as it is only through a sustained research agenda that we will be able to definit ely conclude whether 110 social-psychological techniques can positively contribute to reconciliati on across a broad range of conflict-affected societies. 111 CHAPTER 4: RESULTS This chapter will discuss the findings of the field experiment. 179 As statistical techniques were used to evaluate the results, I have attempted to present the results in such a wa y that they can be understood by both a technical and non-technical audience. I will begin by explai ning the methods used for data analysis and will give the reader a basic explanation of how to interpret the statistical results. I will then present the findings for the sociodem ographic characteristics of participants followed by the findings for each of the dependent variables (prejudi ce, empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness and healing). At the beginning of the section for each variable, I present a summary that wi ll serve as a guide to help the reader understand the important results for each variable. The informati on in the summary will be the focus of the discussion for that variable in Chapter 5. For the non -technical reader, you may find it sufficient to read the summary and go on to the next variable. F or the technical reader, I present the statistical results following the summa ry with an explanation of the steps we followed to produce those results in order that future researchers wil l be able to replicate these steps. To that end, both significant and non-significant results a re reported. While following basic convention for reporting statistical results, I have tried t o simplify and explain the technical language as much as possible to make it accessible to both the techni cal and non- technical reader. While Chapter 4 will focus on presenting the statistical res ults of the study, 179 I would like to thank the Fletcher School of Law a nd Diplomacy for its generous gift of a Summer Rese arch Funds Grant that supported the statistical analysis presented here. I would also like to thank Reid Of fringa for the enormous amount of time and energy he spent helping me analyze and understand the results of this data . Where I refer to \"we\" or \"us\" I am referring to Reid and me , as he was an integral part of ensuring the qualit y of this data analysis. 112 Chapter 5 will conclude with a discussion of how these findings relate to the lite rature and what they mean for both theory and practice. Understanding the Data Analysis We analyzed the effects of the dialogue, training and mixed method workshops on the de pendent variables (prejudice, empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness and healing) using a statistical technique known as a mixed model ANOVA, or an analysis of variance. This technique al lows us to determine which factors best explain the changes in our dependent variables. The type of ANOVA we used is referred to as a 2x2x2x2 mixed model ANOVA. The '2 's represent the following: The technique used in the workshop (dialogue, training or mixed methods): The first '2' refers to whether the workshop used the dialogue technique; The second '2' refers to whether the workshop used the training technique. Building the ANOVA in this way allowed us to evaluate the effect of both the training and dialogue techniques as wel l as the effect of the mixed method workshops in which the dialogue and training techniques were both used. I will explain below how to interpret the results of the ANOVA to understand which of the three techniques best explain the change in the dependent variable. The change in the dependent variable before and after the workshops: The session variable represents the change between the participant's survey responses be fore the workshops (Q2), and after the workshops (Q3). 113 The participant's identity group: The identity group of participants was included in the ANOVA in order to determine if the workshops had differential effects for me mbers of different identity groups. We therefore evaluated the results of the experiment using what is known as a 2 ( dialogue technique: dialogue technique used, no dialogue technique used) x 2(training technique: tr aining technique used, no training technique used) 2(identity group: GAM, PETA) x 2(session: Q 2, Q3) mixed model ANOVA in which the session variable was a within-subjects mea sure evaluating change from before undergoing the workshops (Q2) to after the workshops ( Q3). Interpreting the Results of the ANOVA: We ran the ANOVA's using SPSS (version PASW Statistics 18). When you run the ANOV A's the following outputs are possible: An interaction between either the dialogue or the training technique and the session variable: When we see this result, we know that it is either the dialogue or training technique that best explains the change in the dependent variable before and after t he workshops. For example, if we are looking at prejudice and we see an interaction between the dialogue technique and the session variable, we can conclude that the dialogue technique caused the change in prejudice to occur. When we report this interaction, we say that we found a significant interaction between the dialogue technique and session, followed by the F-statistic and p-value, which looks like F(2,92)=5.42; p=.002. For the non-technical reader, focus on the p-value, which represents the level of statistical significance of the finding, or the confi dence we have in the result. A p-value of less than .05 is considered significant and robust, a p-val ue 114 between .05 and 1 is said to be \"at trend level\" and is a good but not overwhelmingly strong result, while p-values over 1 are not considered significant. The F-stat istic is a value that shows the degrees of freedom and is used to calculate the p-value. I repor t it to comply with convention, but the p-value is what we're really interested in. A three-way interaction between training, dialogue and session: This is also an excellent result that means that one of our workshop techniques (dialogue, training or mixed methods) best explains the change in our dependent variable. However, because of the way we designed our ANOVA, a three-way interaction requires us to do some stat istical follow-up tests to determine which of the three methods best explains the change in the dependent variable. I will not attempt to explain the statistics behind these fol low up tests, but I will note in the text when we are conducting following up tests and wil l detail the steps we take to do this so that others can replicate these results in the futur e. The non-technical reader can peruse these explanations of the follow-up tests and f ocus on the results at the end, which will conclude which of the three techniques is responsible for the change in the dependent variable. You will also see the F-statistic and p -values reported. A main effect of session: A main effect of session means there has been a change in the dependent variable from before and after the workshops. However, a main effect of session is only a meaningful result for our purposes if there is also an interaction or a three-way interaction that goes with it. When we get a main effect of session absent an interaction , it means that it is not the workshops that are causing the change. This change is generally explained by what is known as regression toward the mean , or a natural tendency over time for variables that were extreme to start with to drift t oward the 115 average. As such, we report main effects of session when we find them, but the res ults do not indicate that our workshops explain the change. A main effect of workshop technique: This means that participants in one of the workshop groups (either dialogue or training) had higher means on the average of before and after workshop scores on the variable being measured (for example, prejudice) . Similar to the main effect of session, absent a significant interaction , this does not indicate that the workshops explain the improvement in the dependent variable. A main effect of identity group: This is the same concept as the main effect of session and workshop technique, but means that one of the identity groups, either GAM or PETA, had higher scores on the dependent variable. Absent a significant interaction , a main effect of identity group does not indicate that the workshops differentially improved our dependent variables. However, if we see a main effect of identity group with a significant interaction , we conclude that the workshop had a different effect on GAM than PETA participants. In order to determine that one of our workshops is responsible for the change in the dependent variable, we are looking for either an interaction or a three-way interaction . If we get a main effect of session, main effect of workshop technique, or main effect of identity group without an interaction , we report it, but the results do not indicate that our workshops are responsible for the change so we do not consider them important findings for the purposes of this study. Regression Analysis: The last step in our data analysis was to use a linear regression model to try to identify the conditions or variables that predict the changes in our dependent variables. We only used 116 regressions for the dependent variables that showed a significant change in orde r to explore what was driving this change. We therefore explored the hypotheses that wartime experiences/exposure t o traumatic events, PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms, contact with members of the outgroup befor e the workshops, number of dependents, income, amount of education and/or improvement in other dependent variables significantly predict the improvement we saw in a parti cular dependent variable. We chose these variables in an effort to understand what kind of people respond best to which kind of workshop. For example, you will see below that we were able to determine that people who entered the workshops highly symptomatic of PTSD were less likely to believe that reconciliation is important after the workshops or that dialogue workshops work best in r educing prejudice for people who enter the workshops with high initial levels of prejudice. As s uch, our regressions focus on practical predictions to help make recommendations about how to max imize the effect of future workshops. When reporting the results of regressions, you will see two possible results: 1. The regression did not predict the variables we were testing. In this case, we report the findings like this: \"Neither contact, number of dependents, income nor amount of education significantly predicted behavioral prejudice improvement. When all of t he variables were included in the regression, the overall model was not significant, F (4, 94)= 0.502, p=0.743.\" You can see from the fact that the p-value was over .05 that the model was not significant. As it is standard practice to report the F-statistic wi th the p-value, I 117 do so here, but the non-technical reader need only notice that the p-value shows that the model is not significant. 2. The regression predicts the variables we were testing. In this case, we use standard convention for reporting significant regression results, which looks like this: \"W e found that the number of dependents significantly predicted improvement in affective pre judice. The overall model was significant, F(1, 96)= 5.949, p=0.017, r 2=0.058, with beta values (B=0.461), indicating that the number of dependents positively predicted affective prejudice improvement.\" This means that the more dependents a person has, the more he improved on affective prejudice during the workshops. Again, the p-value tells you that the model is significant. The r 2, or r-squared, tells you the percent of the dependent variable you are explaining with the independent variable. In the example above, t he r 2 indicates that 5.8% of the change in affective prejudice is explained by the number of dependents a participant has. Finally, the beta value tells you the direction of the relationship. If the beta value is positive like in the example above, you interpret the results to mean that people with more dependents will improve more on affective prejudice. With that discussion on how to interpret the results of our statistical analysi s, I now turn to the findings below. Findings Sociodemographic characteristics of participants This section explains the background characteristics of the study participant s. It highlights similarities and differences between participants who identify with G AM and PETA with respect 118 to levels of education, income, access to basic needs and wartime experiences/e xposure to trauma. While these variables do not necessarily predict the changes in our depe ndent variables, they are useful for understanding the context in which the two groups enter the workshops. As seen in Table 2, participants who identified with PETA had a higher level of educ ation, with 56% of participants graduating from high school, as compared to only 33% of participants w ho identified with GAM. While we did not find that level of education was a significa nt predictor of any of our dependent variables, this finding confirms previous research on Aceh that su ggests that GAM members have lower levels of educational attainment than the civil ian population as they dropped out of school at an early age to join the struggle for independence.180 As such, it might be expected that current incomes for GAM members would be lower than t hose for PETA members', however, the data suggests that incomes do not differ substant ially between the two groups. While 78% of participants who identify with GAM earn below 800,000Rp (USD 95) per month, 72% of participants who identify with PETA are in a similar situati on. Moreover, while 23% of those who identify with GAM earn over 800,000Rp per month, only a slightly larger 29% of participants who identify with PETA earn the same. The data suggest that six years after the signing of the peace agreement, incomes for GAM members a re approaching those of PETA members. Table 2: Sociodemographic Characteristics of Insurgents: Aceh, Indonesia,\" (www.conflictanddevelopment.org: The World Bank, 20 10), Women 1% 0% 1% 31% Moreover, while similar percentages of participants who identified with G AM and PETA reported difficulty finding work and meeting the needs of their families, a la rger percentage of participants who identified with GAM expressed a lack of shelter, water and sa nitation, and food. This is due in part to the significantly higher percentages of GAM members who we re displaced and had their homes damaged or destroyed during the conflict (see Table 4). Table 3: Current Conditions Current Condition PETA (n= 43) GAM (n= 63) Total (n=106) Lack of adequate shelter 47% 53% Lack of water and Lack of food 40% 48% 44% the needs of your 79% 77% Difficulty finding work 77% 78% by family or community 16% 8% 11% 120 Fear of living among family or community members 33% 29% 30% Perception of current security situation 35% 30% 32% Do you agree with the signing of the peace agreement? Strongly Disagree previously attended a peace ceremony 28% 33% 31% Additionally, while high percentages of participants from both groups reported ex posure to traumatic events during the conflict, participants who identified with GAM report ed greater exposure to traumatic events than participants who identified with PETA (see T able 4). Using a linear regression, we explored the hypothesis that wartime experi ences predicted pre- workshop levels of PTSD, depression or anxiety. The overall model was not signific ant, indicating that wartime experiences do not predict these symptoms. This is not sur prising given that PTSD symptoms are predicted not only by a person's exposure to trauma or stre ss but by his or her personal predisposition to developing PTSD. 181 Similarly, we did not find that wartime experiences predicted improvement in any of our dependent variables. 181 Victoria M. McKeever and Maureen E. Huff, \"A diath esis-stress model of post-traumatic stress disorder : Ecological, biological and residual stress pathways ,\" Review of General Psychology 7, no. 3 (2003). 121 Table 4: Wartime experiences/Exposure to Traumatic Events Traumatic Event PETA (n= 43) GAM (n= 63) Total (n=106) Witnessed physical punishment 40% shamed in public 40% Forced to humiliate another person 12% 10% 10% Forced to injure family member or friend 9% 13% 11% Forced to injure someone who is not a family member or friend 19% 17% 18% With this background information in mind, I now turn to the effect of the workshops on each of the dependent variables: prejudice, empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness a nd healing. As mentioned above, we have included identity group in the mixed model ANOVA to allow us to determine if the workshops had the same effect on those who identified with GAM or PE TA. 122 Prejudice Summary: The initial hypothesis of this dissertation was that dialogue-based contact w ould reduce prejudice in a post-conflict context. The results of this experiment confir m this hypothesis by demonstrating that the dialogue workshops were most effective at reducing pre judice for both GAM and PETA participants. This change applies only to affective prejudice, howe ver, as we saw no change in cognitive or behavioral prejudice. As will be discussed at length in Cha pter 5, these results confirm our hypothesis and support findings from other research on the re lationship between contact and prejudice. 182 Results-Affective prejudice: As discussed in Chapter 2, we used a 10-question scale of 5 positive and 5 negative emotional states to measure affective prejudice. Participants ranked each question on a 4-point Likert scale that ranged from 1 (not at all), 2 (a little), 3 (avera ge), 4 (a lot). To calculate each participant's score, we reverse scored the positive trait s, meaning if the participant selected 1 indicating I do not hate members of the other group at all, we calculat ed a score of 4. We likewise scored a 2 as a 3, a 3 as a 2 and a 4 as a 1. The lowest possible score, indicat ing the lowest amount of affective prejudice was 10, while the highest possible score was 40. After reverse scoring the positive traits and adding up the before (Q2) and after (Q3) w orkshop scores for each individual, we conducted the mixed model ANOVA as described above. The ANOVA revealed an overall decrease in prejudice scores with a mean scor e of 18.41 before the workshops and a mean score of 17.78 after the workshops. This change is referred to as a 182 Stephan and Stephan, \"Intergroup Anxiety.\"; A. Voc i and M. Hewstone, \"Intergroup contact and prejudic e toward immigrants in Italy: The mediational role of anxiety and the moderational role of group salienc e,\" Group Processes and Intergroup Relations 6(2003); Pettigrew and Tropp, \"How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice? Meta-analytic tests of three mediators.\" 123 main effect of session, F(1, 96)= 5.280, p=0.024. In addition, there was also a three-way interaction between the training technique, the dialogue technique and the sessi on, F(1, 96)=11.185, p=0.001, which means that either the mixed technique, the training technique or the dialogue technique explains this change. As explained above, when we find a three-way interaction we have to conduct follow-up statistical tests to determine which technique is driving the change. To do th is, we went through the following steps: 1. Created a new grouping variable with four levels (training only, dialogue o nly, mixed techniques, and control). 2. Created a new dependent variable called affective prejudice improvement, whic h was computed by subtracting the Q3 affective prejudice scores from those in Q2. 3. Ran a univariate ANOVA with the new workshop grouping variable and perceived enemy group, using affective prejudice improvement as the dependent variable (DV) . The overall ANOVA was significant F(7, 95)=2.638, p=0.015, as was the main effect of the new workshop grouping variable, F(3, 95)=3.837, p=0.012. 4. Used Scheffe post-hoc tests on the new workshop grouping variable, which indicated that the dialogue group (mean change=2.625) improved significantly more than the control group (mean change=-0.104), p=0.036 and the mixed group (mean change=-0.444), p=0.010. The dialogue group did improve more than the training group (mean change=1.578), p=0.828, but the training group did not differ from the control group, p=0.250 or the mixed group, p=0.085. The mixed group also did not differ from the control group, p=0.893. 124 The follow-up analyses therefore indicate that the workshop groups that used the di alogue technique were most effective in changing participant's affective prej udice scores, with a 2.63 point change on the prejudice scale from before to after the workshops. Regressions: We ran linear regressions on a variety of variables to determine if we could fi nd additional variables that predict, or explain the reduction of affective prejudice . Overall, we did not find any variables that further explained the above findings with the excepti on of the number of dependents, which significantly predicted improvement in affective prejudice. 183 The overall model was significant, F(1, 96)= 5.949, p=0.017, r 2=0.058, with beta values (B=0.461) indicating that the number of dependents positively predicted affective prejudice i mprovement. This means that people with more dependents responded more positively to the workshops in terms of affective prejudice, perhaps because having more children gives pe ople a greater stake in ensuring reconciliation and sustainable peace. We also explored the hypothesis that wartime experiences significantly pr edicted improvement in affective prejudice. The only groups for which this was the case was the trai ning groups, where the regression model was significant, F(1, 21)=7.977, p=0.010 and the Beta values indicate that wartime experiences positively predicted affective pre judice improvement within the training group, B=0.536. 184 Finally, we decided to add pre-workshop PTSD scores to the model as a second step in t he regression to determine if the combination of wartime experiences and PTSD ha d any predictive 183 Neither contact, income or amount of education sig nificantly predicted affective prejudice improvemen t. When all of these variables were included in the regress ion, the overall model was not significant, F(3, 99 )=1.178, p=0.322. 184 In the group, F(1, ups, F(1, 19) = 1.314, p=0.266, the regression model was not significant, meaning that wartime experiences did n ot have any predictive power within these groups. 125 power. Within the control group, the first step of the regression model was not signifi cant, but in the second step, when HTQ scores were added, the model became significant, F(2, 26)=4.206, p=0.026. This was a significant change from step 1 to step 2, F change = 8.347, p=0.008. Beta values revealed that Q2 HTQ scores negatively predicted improvement for the c ontrol group, B=-0.082, p=0.008, while wartime experiences were not a significant predictor of impr ovement, B=0.158, p=0.104. This finding is interesting because it suggests that PTSD symptoms contribute to a natural enhancement of affective prejudice. Cognitive Prejudice: The cognitive prejudice scale included 6 measures of competence, 4 measures of warmth, 2 measures of status and 2 measures of competition. Only the measure of competition was reverse scored as described in the section on affective prejudi ce above. As such, the minimum score for the scale was 14, indicating the most prejudice, while the m aximum was 56. We then ran the mixed model ANOVA as described above and found no significant effects from this analysis, supporting the idea that none of the workshop techniques significantly affected cognitive prejudice. Similarly, neither previous contact, number of dependents, income or amount of education significantly predicted cognitive prejudice improvement. When all of these var iables were included in the regression, the overall model was not significant, F(4, 88)= 0.511, p=0.728. Likewise, none of the other dependent variables significantly predicted improvem ent in cognitive prejudice. 126 Behavioral Prejudice: The behavioral prejudice scale was scored by reverse coding questions 29-33 (see Appendix B for questionnaire) and throwing out question 28, \"If given the opportunity I would admit members of the outgroup only as visitors to my country\" because of a translation error that caused participants to understand the question differently . As such, the least prejudice score was 1, while the most prejudice score was 5. We then ran the mixed model ANOVA and found no results to indicate that our workshops had any effect on behavioral prejudice with the exception of the relatively weak result of a significant main effect of identity group, F(1, 98)= 7.658, p=0.007, combined with a trend toward a significant interaction between session, identity group and the training techni que, F(1, 98)= 3.020, p=0.085. This means that the training technique was the only technique that produced a change in behavioral prejudice, but it was only for either GAM or PETA, and only at tr end level (the p value was between 0.05 and 1 so the result is significant, but not terribly robust). To explore which group was driving the change, we conducted follow up analyses according to t he following steps: 1. We split the file by identity group (GAM or PETA) 2. We ran a 2(training technique) x2(dialogue technique) x2(session) mixed model AN OVA for each identity group. We found that it was the participants who identify with PETA whose behavioral prej udice scores decreased in the training group. 185 However, we don't think these results mean very much given that they are a) only at trend level and b) the means for behavioral prejudice score s in the training 185 We found no significant effects for participants w ho identify with GAM. For participants who identify with PETA, we found an interaction between the training technique and the session variable, or the change i n behavioral prejudice before and after the workshop, F(1, 39)= 2.919, p=0.095. 127 groups decreased from 1.061 before the workshops and moved to 0.833 after the workshops, while the means for behavioral prejudice scores in the other workshop groups increa sed from 0.472 to 0.861. Because all of the groups ended up with means of about 0.8, we think these results may be best explained by regression toward the mean. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the workshops significantly decreased behavioral prejudice. Regressions: After conducting the linear regression described above, we did not find that any of our variables significantly predicted change in behavioral prejudice. Neith er previous contact, number of dependents, income nor amount of education significantly predicted behavioral prejudice improvement. When all of the variables were included in the regression, the over all model was not significant, F(4, 94)= 0.502, p=0.743. Similarly, none of the dependent variables significantly predicted improvement in behavioral prejudice. Empathy Summary: The original hypothesis of this dissertation was that dialogue-based contac t would increase empathy in a post-conflict context. However, the results of this exper iment disconfirm this hypothesis, as we saw no significant change in empathy as a result of the w orkshops. However, we did find evidence to support the claims of previous research that initial levels of empathy are correlated with initial levels of contact, prejudice, trust and f orgiveness. Based on these claims, we expected increased contact through the workshops to lead to an incr ease in empathy. Yet, we found that these correlations did not translate into a signifi cant improvement in empathy during the workshops. In fact, we found initial levels of empathy to be negat ively correlated with improvement in both affective and cognitive empathy, meaning tha t people who enter the workshops with high levels of empathy did worse in empathy improvement than other 128 participants. This suggests that there may be a ceiling effect, whereby part icipants who enter the workshops with high levels of empathy will not be expected to develop more empathy for the outgroup. This work implies that participants with lower initials levels of e mpathy, and therefore less previous contact with members of the outgroup, may be better suited to facili tated intergroup contact programs. Finally, we found that improvement in affective empathy is positively correl ated with improvement in all forms of prejudice (affective, cognitive and behavioral), as well as in all forms of healing (PTSD, depression and anxiety). This suggests that those who di d improve in affective empathy during the workshops (participants who entered the workshops with l ow initial levels of empathy) also improved in prejudice and healing. These findings imply that either affective empathy improvement is moderating improvement in prejudice and heali ng, or that affective empathy improvement is secondary to the improvement of these varia bles and can be expected to follow suit if participants engage in repeated contact. Results-Affective Empathy: After scoring the empathy scale, we repeated the 2x2x2x2 mixed model ANOVA described above and found that affective empathy scores did not significa ntly change as a result of the workshops as evidenced by the fact that we saw no interactions between any of the variables.186 186 We did find the following main effects but, they do not indicate any effects of the works hops themselves: A trend toward a significant main effect of worksho p group for the dialogue technique, F(1, 94)= 3.213 , p=0.076. The means indicate that regardless of sess ion, affective empathy was higher in the dialogue technique (11.679) compared to the non-dialogue gro ups (10.718). This merely indicates that participan ts in the dialogue group entered the workshops with sl ightly higher affective empathy scores. A main effect of group for the identity group, F(1, 94)= 9,986, p=0.002, with means indicating that PE TA had higher affective empathy scores (12.045) than G AM (10.352). We also found a significant interactio n between the dialogue technique and identity group, F(1, 94)= 4.664, p=0.033, with the means indicating that PETA participants who underwent the dialogue t echnique had higher affective empathy scores (mean=13.104) compared to GAM participants (mean=10 .253). In the non-dialogue groups, there was no difference between identity groups: GAM participant s (mean=10.986) were comparable to PETA participants (mean=10.450). 129 Regressions: While the workshops did not produce a direct improvement in empathy, our regressions reveal interesting results about the relationship between contact and empathy.187 First, our regressions find support for previous research showing that empathy may be mediating the relationship between preexisting contact with members of the outgroup and pre judice, trust and forgiveness. 188 We reach this conclusion because we find initial levels of contact positively predict initial levels of affective empathy, F(1,103)=8.232, p=0.005, r 2 =0.74, B=0.411, which in turn predict less affective, cognitive and behavioral prejudice, as well as more t rust and forgiveness (see table 5 below). Because contact does not predict prejudice, trus t and forgiveness directly, but does predict affective empathy, which then predicts prejudice, tr ust and forgiveness, we conclude that empathy may be mediating the relationship between contact, pr ejudice, trust and forgiveness. Because contact predicts empathy, we hypothesized that facilitated c ontact would lead to an increase in empathy. However, as explained above, it did not. Instead, we saw tha t facilitated contact led to a decrease in affective prejudice and an increase in trust, forgi veness and PTSD symptoms as described throughout this chapter. Yet despite the fact that facilita ted contact did not lead to a direct improvement in empathy, we find that improvement in affective empathy positively predicted improvements in all forms of prejudice and healing (see t able 7 below). This suggests once again that empathy may be mediating the relationship between facil itated contact, prejudice and healing. We did not find this relationship to be true for trust or forgive ness, however, which we expected given that initial levels of contact predicted highe r initial levels of trust and forgiveness. Chapter 5 will discuss the possible explanations for this. 188 Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup Contact, Forgiveness, and Experience of \"The Troubles\" in Northern Irela nd.\" 130 Additionally, we found that people who enter the workshops with high initial levels of affec tive empathy did not respond as well to the workshops as those with lower initial levels of empathy, as evidenced by the fact that initial levels of affective empathy (Q2) are negatively correlated with improvement in PTSD, anxiety, forgiveness and affective empathy in the training groups (though it is positively correlated with trust improvement in the training groups) ; negatively correlated with improvement in depression, affective and cognitive prejudice and af fective empathy in the dialogue group; and negatively correlated with improvement in be havioral prejudice and affective empathy in the mixed groups (see table 6 below). These results suggest that structured intergroup contact may not be the best avenue for promoting empathy for people who already have high levels of empathy for the outgroup. However, i n the training groups, those with high initial levels of affective empathy did well i n terms of improvement in trust, suggesting empathy may be required to increase trust. Overall, these results suggest that intergroup contact is most effective for those who have lower initial levels of empathy with the outgroup, which is associated with less inte rgroup contact, more prejudice, less trust and less forgiveness. It is possible in the future tha t empathy could be used as the main criteria on the first survey to select people for participati on in the program. More research is needed to confirm this however, as it raises the question of whe ther low empathy participants would respond as well to the workshops if high empathy parti cipants were not also present. Finally, we report that neither contact, income, nor amount of education significant ly predicted affective empathy improvement. When all of these variables were included in t he regression, the overall model was not significant, F (3,98)= 0.178, p=0.911. However, similar to improvement 131 in affective prejudice, we did find that number of dependents significantly predic ted improvement in affective empathy. The overall model was significant, F(1, 0.031, that the number of dependents negatively Table 5: Correlations between Q2 Empathy and Other Variables at Q2 Measure Affective Empathy Improvement Cognitive Empathy Improvement Affective Prejudice Improvement Cognitive Prejudice Improvement Behavioral Prejudice Improvement Tolerance Improvement Trust Improvement Forgiveness Improvement PTSD Improvement Depression Improvement Anxiety Improvement Q2 -.067 Scores Measure Affective Empathy Improvement Cognitive Empathy Improvement Affective Prejudice Improvement Cognitive Prejudice Improvement Behavioral Prejudice Improvement Tolerance Improvement Trust Improvement Forgiveness Improvement PTSD Improvement Depression Improvement Anxiety Improvement Affective Empathy Improvement .292 -.049 .211 -.076 .298 -.016 . 244 -.132 .285 -.219 .172 Table 7: Correlations between Empathy Improvement a nd Improvement in Other Variables 133 Cognitive Empathy: Similar to affective empathy, we repeated the 2x2x2x2 ANOVA described above, but did not find any significant effects of any of the workshops. 189 However, we did find several main effects that we report here, though none of these are caused by the workshops: A trend toward a significant main effect of session, indicating a change for all subjects regardless of group, F(1, 94)= 3.604, p=0.061. The means indicate that overall, cognitive empathy increased from Q2 (4.136) to Q3 (4.533). A main effect of workshop technique for the training technique, F(1, 94)= 4.444, p=0.038, with means indicating that the training technique had higher cognitive empathy scores (4.663) than the non-training groups (4.007). A trend toward a significant main effect of group for the dialogue technique, F(1, 94)= 3.221, p=0.076, with means indicating that the dialogue technique had higher cognitive empathy scores (4.614) compared to the non-dialogue groups (4.056). Regressions: Similar to affective empathy, we found that initial levels of cognitive empathy were positively correlated with initial levels of outgroup contact ( see table 5). However, unlike affective empathy, cognitive empathy does not appear to be positively correlated with other variables such as prejudice, trust and forgi veness. This may suggest that it is affective, rather than cognitive empathy that is mediating the relationship between contact and prejudice, trust and forgiveness. 189 We found no significant interaction between either of the workshop techniques and session or between identity group and session. This indicates that neither the enemy group, nor the training technique or dialogue technique affected the change in cognitive empathy from Q2 to Q3. We also did not find any significant main effect of group for e ither the identity group, or the interaction betwee n training and dialogue technique, nor was there a si gnificant interaction between any of the workshop techniques with identity group. 134 Moreover, we also found that those with high initial levels of cognitive empathy di d not respond well to the workshops in terms of improvement in cognitive empathy. Somewhat unsurprisingly then, improvement in cognitive empathy was not as strongly linked to improvement in prejudice and healing as was affective empat hy. Overall, improvement in cognitive empathy was positively correlated wit h improvement in behavioral prejudice, trust and PTSD symptoms. Finally, we note that neither income nor amount of education significantly predic ted affective prejudice improvement. When these variables were included in the regression, the overall model was not significant, F (1,95)=1.453, p =0.231. However, we did find that contact and number of dependents significantly predicted improvement in cognitive empathy. The overall model was significant, F(2, 93)= 4.404, p=0.015, r 2=0.087. The beta values indicate that contact negatively (B= -0.109, p=0.010) predicted cognitive empathy improvement, while the number of dependents exhibited a trend toward positively predicting (B=0.165, p=0.090) cognitive empathy improvement. Trust Summary: The initial hypothesis of this dissertation was that dialogue-based contact would increase trust in a post-conflict context. However, this hypothesis is not supported given that we found that only the training groups produced a slight improvement in trust, while the dialogue technique and the mixed methods technique produced no change. Moreover, while the change in the training group was statistically significant, the change may not be clinically signific ant as the means improved by only 0.54 points on the trust scale. 135 Results: To explore this hypothesis, we added up the answer to the three questions on the trust scale and ran the 2x2x2x2 mixed model ANOVA as described above. The ANOVA results showed that trust scores improved most when participants underwent the training technique by revealing a significant interaction between session and training technique, F(1, 98)= 7.928, p=0.006. Examination of the means revealed that participants who underwent the training technique improved slightl y from a mean trust score of 7.43 at Q2 to 7.97 at Q3 (0.54 points), while participants in workshops that did not use the training technique changed from a mean trust score of 7.86 at Q2 to 7.37 at Q3, a decrease of 0.49 points. No other significant effects were found for the mixed model ANOVA. Because the above means indicated that the training groups improved while the non- training groups declined, it was not clear if the above interaction was driven by the improvement in the training groups or the decline in the non-training groups. We therefore conducted follow-up tests to determine what was driving this intera ction. To do this, we split the file into training groups and non-training groups, and ran two follow-up repeated measures ANOVAs using trust scores as the dependent varia ble. We found that the interaction was driven by the improvement in trust scores in the training groups because the groups that did not use the training technique did not significantly change from before (Q2) to after the workshops (Q3), F(1, 56)= 2.748, p=0.103, while the Q2 to Q3, F(1, 48)=6.605, p=0.013. To further explore trust improvement, we chose to look at each workshop group, 1-9, independently to determine if a particular group was driving our results. We did this by conducting a univariate ANOVA, considering each group (1-9) separately and 136 including participant identity group.190 The results showed that the overall model was not significant, F(14, 92)=0.893, p=0.569, nor was the effect of identity p=0.687, or workshop group, F(6, 92)= 5.074, between identity and workshop group, F(6, 92)=0.244, p=0.961 was also not significant. It is likely that considering each workshop group separately re duced our ability to find a significant effect of the workshop groups due to low power. To further explore the relationship between trust and individual workshop groups, we also tried running an LSD post-hoc analysis on the workshop groups. This revealed that training group 4 improved more than dialogue groups 2 (p=0.052) and 5 (p=0.057) at trend level, while mixed group 7 did better than dialogue groups 2 (p=0.016) and 5 (p=0.017), as well as control group 9 (p=0.029). These data suggest that the improvement is primarily being driven by training group 4 and mixed group 7. While group 4 used only the training technique, group 7 was a mixed-method group that used both the dialogue and training techniques. Overall, these data support the idea that trust levels improve more from undergoing workshops that incorporate training methods. Furthermore, they may suggest a learning curve on the part of the facilitators as the effect was more pronounced in later workshops. Regressions: Unfortunately, our regressions did not give us much additional information about what is driving trust improvement. We did find that initial levels of contact significantly predicted improvement in trust, as the overall regres sion model was significant, F(1, with beta values (B= -0.081) indicating that contact negatively predicted trust improvement. However, we f ound that neither the number of dependents, income or amount of education significantly 190 This required us to compute a new dependent variab le measuring trust improvement by subtracting trust scores before the workshops (Q2) from trust s cores after the workshops (Q3). 137 predicted trust improvement given that when all of these variables were included in the regression, the overall model was not significant. We also explored the hypothesis that wartime experiences and initial PTSD scores significantly predicted improvement in trust scores. While a simple regress ion showed that wartime-experiences did not predict improvement in trust scores, initia l PTSD scores did significantly predict trust improvement, as the overall model was significant F(1, 96)=4.832, p=0.030, r 2=0.048. The Beta value (B=0.022) shows that higher PTSD scores positively predict improvement in trust, meaning that parti cipants who were more highly symptomatic of PTSD before the workshops improved more on trust than other participants. However, the overall r-value of the model suggests that PTSD scores explained a relatively low amount of the variance in trust improvement. Given that the original ANOVA revealed different degrees of trust improveme nt differed for different workshop techniques, we decided to look at each workshop technique separately in our regression analysis. We therefore re-ran our re gressions after splitting our file into 4 groups: the control group, the training group, the dialogue group and the mixed technique group. We found that wartime experiences did not significantly predict trust improvem ent for any of the four groups. However initial PTSD scores positively predicted improvement in the mixed technique group, as the overall model was significant, F(1, 21)=4.571, p=0.044, r 2=0.179, with the beta values suggesting a positive relationship between PTSD scores and trust improvement, B=0.034, p=0.044. This means that people with a high number of PTSD symptoms before the workshops showed the most improvement in trust in the mixed technique workshops. We also explored the 138 hypothesis that this relationship would be modulated by wartime experiences, but i t was not. These results therefore suggest that the mixed methods workshops were able t o differentially improve trust scores in participants with high PTSD sympto ms. However, this does not appear to give us much meaningful information. Tolerance Summary: The initial hypothesis of this dissertation was that dialogue-based contact would increase tolerance in a post-conflict context. However, this hypothesis is not supported given that we found no significant improvement in tolerance scores. Results: After scoring the tolerance scale, we ran the 2x2x2x2 mixed model ANO VA described above and found that the workshops had no significant effect on tolerance scores, as we saw no interaction between either of the workshop techniques and session . However, we report the following significant findings, but note that these findings cannot be attributed to an effect of the workshops: A trend toward a significant main effect of session , indicating a change for all subjects from before (Q2) to after (Q3) the workshops regardless of wor kshop group, F(1, 94)= 4.028, p=0.082. The means indicate tolerance increased from Q2 (6.852) to Q3 (7.154), though this change cannot be said to be due to the workshops. A trend toward a significant interaction between session and identity group , F(1, 94)= 4.612, p=0.063. The means indicate that participants who identify with PETA improved more from Q2 (7.028) to Q3 (7.653) than GAM, Q2 (6.675) to Q3 (6.654). Again, this slight effect cannot be attributed to the workshops. A significant main effect of identity group , F(1, 94)= 7.640, p=0.007, with means indicating that higher tolerance scores (7.340) compared to GAM (6.665). A main effect of workshop group for the training technique, F(1, 94)= 8.880, p=0.004, with means indicating that participants in the training groups had higher tolerance scores (7.367) than participants in the non-training groups (6.638). Regressions: Neither the number of dependents, income, or amount of education significantly predicted tolerance improvement. When all of these variables were included in the regression, the overall model was not significant. However, we did find that contact significantly predicted improvement in tolerance . The overall model was significant, F(1, 99)= 4.404, p=0.038, r 2=0.043, with beta values (B=0.074) indicating that levels of preexisting contact with the outgroup positively predicted tolerance improvement. No other significant results wer e found. Forgiveness Summary: The initial hypothesis of this dissertation was that dialogue-based contact would increase forgiveness in a post-conflict context. This hypothesis is supported b y data showing that the dialogue technique produced the greatest improvement in forgiveness for both GAM and PETA participants, though GAM participants showed more improvement. The mixed methods workshops also worked well for both groups, though not as well as the dialogue workshops. The training workshops produced an increase in forgiveness for GAM participants, but PETA participants got sl ightly 140 worse in terms of forgiveness in the training workshops, suggesting that at le ast some elements of the dialogue workshops are necessary for PETA participants to improve in forgiveness. Chapter 5 will discuss the possible explanations for this differe nce. Results: To examine the original hypothesis, we scored the forgiveness scale by reverse scoring questions 5 4) Do you agree that it is important that your community never forgets the wrongs done by the other community? 56) Do you agree that it is important that your community never forgives the wrongs done to you by their group? and 57) Do you agree that if you forgive them, your group will appear weak? The maximum score on the 7-point forgiveness scale was therefore 28 and the minim um score was 7. 191 We then repeated the 2x2x2x2 mixed model ANOVA described above. We found that the groups that incorporated the dialogue technique (both the dialogue and mixed- method workshops) did better than the training groups, producing a significant improvement in forgiveness of 1.4 points on the forgiveness scale. The following data support this conclusion: We found a significant main effect of session, F(1, 93)=4.225, p=0.043, with means that all participants improved over time from Q2 (mean=21.60) to Q3 (mean=22.22). We also found a significant interaction between session and dialogue technique, F(1, 93)=6.250, p=0.014, in which the means revealed that 191 It is worth noting that both questions 54 and 59 ( Do you agree that Aceh will never move from the past to the future until the two communities learn to forget about the past?) both assume that by answering that they strongly agree that their commu nity should not forget about the past, participants receive a score that indicates that they are the le ast forgiving. While I decided to use the questions as developed by Hewstone et al. in order that my resul ts would be comparable to theirs, I do not agree th at a belief that a group should not forget about the p ast indicates that they are not forgiving. 191 I therefore recommend that the scale be revised to focus solely on questions pertaining directly to forgiveness. 141 the dialogue group improved over time from Q2 (mean=21.08) to Q3 (mean=22.445), and significantly more than those who were not exposed to the dialogue technique, whose forgiveness scores did not change much from Q2(mean=22.13) to Q3 (mean=22.00). We also found that while the dialogue and mixed method workshops increased forgiveness for all participants, the training workshops did not increase forgi veness for PETA participants, who actually became non-significantly less forgiving in the training groups. This decrease in forgiveness effectively lowered the comp arative baselines within our analysis and partially drove our previously reported improveme nt within the dialogue groups across sessions. However, the effect of the dialogue group was also partially driven by improvement for GAM participants within the dia logue groups. Given that this effect is somewhat inconsistent, we have preliminary evidence suggesting that the dialogue technique exhibits more forgiveness improvement overall, or at least protects from a decrease in forgiveness. This suggests that it is necessary to incorporate at least some element of the dialogue workshops in order t o increase forgiveness for both GAM and PETA participants. However, more resea rch is necessary before more definitive conclusions can be reached. Our reasoning i s based on the following evidence: The mixed model ANOVA also revealed a four way interaction between session, training technique, dialogue technique and identity group, F(1, 93)=9.779, p=0.002. We examined this four-way interaction with a follow-up mixed model ANOVA, split by identity group. For GAM, there was a main 142 effect of session, but no other effects were significant. Comparatively, for PETA, there was no main effect of session, nor was there an interaction between session and training group. We also found an interaction between session and dialogue group, with the means indicating that groups that utilized the dialogue technique (dialogue and mixed methods) improved more from Q2 (mean=21.963) to Q3 (mean=23.175), more than the non-dialogue scores declined from Q2 (mean=22.86) to Q3 (mean=21.86). We also found a three-way interaction between session, training group and dialogue group. To examine the three-way interaction further, we used the same new workgroup variable described above, with four levels: dialogue group, training group, mixed methods group, and control group. We also computed a new dependent variable measuring forgiveness improvement by subtracting the forgiveness scores at Q2 from the scores at Q3. We then ran a one-way ANOVA with the new workgroup variable as the independent variable (IV) and forgiveness improvement as the dependent variable (DV). The ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of the new workshop group, F(3, 36)=5.219, p=0.004. Post hoc Scheffe tests revealed that the mixed techniques group improved the most (mean=2.800) and improved significantly more than the training group (mean=-2.00), p=0.005. The mixed group did not significantly change more than the control group (mean=0.0), p=0.113, or the dialogue group (mean=-0.375), p=0.110. No other groups significantly differed from one another. We further examined the relationship between mixed techniques and forgiveness improvement with a univariate ANOVA, considering each 143 workshop group 1-9 separately with the file split by identity group, using forgiveness improvement as our dependent variable. Similar to the above analyses, we knew that we would reduce our power by dividing our participants into such small groups, so we chose to use the LSD post-hoc test. For PETA, the effect of the individual groups was significant, F(6, 40) = 3.928, p=0.005. Similar to the above analyses, we ran LSD post-hoc analyses due to the reduced power of this follow up analysis. The LSD post-hoc tests revealed that training group 1 did significantly worse compared to mixed group 8, p=0.004, but did not significantly differ from the other groups. Similarly, dialogue group 2 did significantly worse than mixed group 8, p=0.002, but did not differ from any other groups. Training group 4 did significantly worse than dialogue group 5, p=0.016, training group 7, p=0.037, and mixed group 8, p<0.001. Dialogue group 5 did significantly worse than mixed group 8, p=0.050, but better than training group 4, p=0.016. This meant that mixed group 8 did significantly better than training group 1, dialogue group 2, training group 4, dialogue group 5, but not mixed group 7. These results support the earlier analyses, which indicated that for PETA, th e mixed group improved slightly, while the training group did slightly worse. Our analysis of the individual workshop groups suggests that this trend was primarily driven by mixed group 8, which improved the most and training group 4, which did significantly worse compared to many of the other groups. However, this analysis should be regarded as preliminary, due to the drastically reduced number of subjects in each group. For PETA, group 1 (n=4), 2 (n=4), 3 (n=5), 5 (n=4), 144 Comparatively the univariate ANOVA for GAM did not have a main effect of individual workshop group and did not have any significant differences between groups 1-9. These analyses indicated that the mixed groups did significantly better than the training groups for PETA. Comparatively, there were no significant differences in improvement in GAM. We chose to explore this relationship further by evaluating the difference in improvement between the identity groups, for each workshop technique. We split the dataset into four groups: training only, dialogue only, mixed technique and control group. Within each of these groups, we ran a one-way ANOVA using improvement in forgiveness scores as the dependent variable, with identity groups as the independent variable. We found that GAM improved significantly more (mean=1.27) than PETA (mean=-2.00) in the training only workshop group, F(1, 22) = 12.829, p=0.002. We also report a trend toward a significant difference between identity groups for the dialogue only workshop group, F(1, 19)=3.109, p=0.094. Here, PETA did not improve during the dialogue workshops, (mean=-0.38) as much as GAM, (mean=2.15). There was no significant difference between the identity groups in the mixed technique workshops, F(1, 21)=.842, p=0.369. Regressions: To better understand what was driving the change in forgiveness, we ran a number of regressions, which gave us the information below. Neither contact, number of dependents, income or amount of education significantly predicted forgiveness improvement. When all of the variables were included in the 145 regression, the overall model was not significant, F(4, 90)= 0.732, p=0.473. None of the individual variables significantly predicted improvement in forgiveness. We also explored the hypothesis that wartime experiences significantly pr edicted improvement in forgiveness, but they did not. We determined this by splitting the file into 4 groups: the control group, the training group, the dialogue group and the mixed technique group. Within these groups, we ran a linear regression, using all warti me experiences, except for head injuries. Wartime experiences did not signifi cantly predict forgiveness improvement in any of the groups, as indicated by the overall model in the control group, F(1, 26)=0.014, p=0.906; the training groups, F(1,19)=3.407, p=.081; the F(1,14)=.397, p=0.539; or the mixed F(1,18)=0.003, p=.960. However, when we added pre-workshop (Q2) PTSD scores to the model as a second step to the regression, we found that those who entered the workshops highly symptomatic of PTSD improved more on forgiveness than others. We reached this conclusion because while the overall model of wartime experiences and HTQ scores at Q2 did not significantly predict forgiveness improvement, F(2, 25)=2.294, p=0.122, the addition of the pre-workshop (Q2) significantly added to the model, Fchange(1, 25)=4.567, p=0.043. Moreover, the coefficients indicate that although wartime experiences were still not a significant predictor, (B=-0.084, p=0.317) , PTSD scores at Q2 positively predicted (B=0.046, p=0.043) forgiveness improvement. We also found a relationship between pre-workshop affective prejudice scores, affective prejudice improvement, and forgiveness improvement, which seems to indicate that improvement in forgiveness was greater for participants w ho had higher affective prejudice scores before undergoing the workshops, as well as for those w ho 146 showed the most improvement in affective prejudice during the workshops. We found this in the following evidence: We explored the hypothesis that affective prejudice scores at Q2 significa ntly predicted improvement in forgiveness. Using a simple regression, affective prejudice significantly predicted forgiveness scores, F(1, 99)=12.195, p=0.001, r 2=0.110. However, we acknowledge that the degree of forgiveness improvement differed, depending on which combination of workshop techniques were utilized. We therefore re-ran our analyses after splitti ng our file into 4 groups: the control group, the training group, the dialogue group and the mixed technique group. Affective prejudice scores at Q2 did not significantly predict forgiveness i n the control group, F(1, 31)=0.028, p=0.869. However, affective prejudice significantly predicted forgiveness improvement in the training group F(1, 22)=12.229, p=0.002, r 2=0.357, and the dialogue group F(1, 19)=5.766, p=0.027, r 2=0.233. The beta values indicate that high affective prejudice scores at Q2 positively predict forgiveness improvement for both the training, B=0.322, and dialogue group, B=0.313. Surprisingly, affective prejudice did not predict improvement in the mixed group, F(1, 21)=2.239, p=0.149. These results suggest that improvement in forgiveness was greater for participants who had higher affective prejudice scores before undergoing the workshops. This was true for the groups that underwent the training technique or the dialogue technique, but not for the groups that underwent the mixed techniques. Because this pattern was so similar to the improvement observed in the affective prejudice scores, we hypothesized that improvement in 147 forgiveness scores was driven by affective prejudice improvement, rather t han affective prejudice scores at Q2. First, we explored the hypothesis that Q2 affective prejudice, affective prejudice improvement and forgiveness improvement were correlated. Again, we split the file into the four groups described above and for each group we ran a 3x3 Pearson correlation matrix using Q2 affective prejudice, affective prejudice improvement and forgiveness improvement. For the control group, only forgiveness improvement and affective prejudice improvement exhibited a significant, negative relationship with one another, r(31)= -0.552, p=0.001. For the training group, affective prejudice correlated with both Q2 affective prejudice, r(22)=0.604, p=0.002 and forgiveness improvement, r(22)=0.512, p=0.011. In confirmation of our previously mentioned regression, Q2 affective prejudice positively correlated with forgiveness improvement. In the dialogue group, affective prejudice improvement positively correlated with Q2 affective prejudice, r(20)=0.735, p<0.001, but not forgiveness improvement, p=0.222. However, in confirmation of the previously mentioned regression, Q2 affective prejudice positively correlated with forgiveness improvement, r(19)=0.482, p=0.027. In the mixed technique group, affective prejudice improvement did not correlate with Q2 affective prejudice, p=0.133, but it did correlate with forgiveness improvement, r(21)=0.436, p=0.038. We then chose to re-run the regression predicting forgiveness with both affective prejudice at Q2 and affective prejudice improvement. Affective prejudice improvement was entered into the model first and the Q2 scores were entered second. For the control group, affective prejudice improvement 148 negatively (B=-0.403) predicted forgiveness improvement, as in the previously reported correlation, F(1, 31)=13.613, p=0.001, r 2=0.305. Affective prejudice scores from Q2 did not significantly add to the overall model, F change = 0.129, p=0.722 and while the overall model remained significant, the F value decreased and the p-value increased, F(2, 30)=6.679, p=0.004. For the training group, affective improvement predicted forgiveness improvement, F(1, 22)=7.818, p=0.011, r 2=0.262. Affective prejudice Q2 scores significantly added to the model, F change = 4.533, p=0.045, positively predicting improvement in forgiveness, B=0.244. However, when the Q2 scores were added to the model, the effect of affective prejudice became non-significant, p=0.278. This indicated that affective prejudice Q2 scores explained more variance than the affective prejudice improvement scores. Some of the variance explained by the Q2 scores overlapped with the improvement scores, which is why the effect of improvement was reduced in the second step of the regression. For the dialogue group, the affective prejudice improvement did not significantly predict forgiveness improvement, with the overall model below our threshold for significance F(1, 19)=1.591, p=0.222. In the second step, Q2 affective prejudice scores trended toward a significant addition to the model, F change =4.007, p=0.061 and the overall model became a non-significant trend, F(2, 18)=2.925, p=0.079 r 2=0.245. The remained non-significant, but Q2 affective prejudice trended toward a positive prediction of forgiveness improvement, B=0.391, p=0.061. For the mixed technique group, affective prejudice improvement positively (B=0.480) predicted forgiveness improvement as indicated in the overall 149 model, F(1, 21)=4.919, p=0.038, r 2=0.190. In the second step, Q2 affective prejudice scores did not significantly contribute to the model p-change = 0.305. The overall model was reduced to a non-significant trend, F(2, 20)=3.026, p=0.071, r 2=0.232. The effect of Q2 affective prejudice scores was not significant, p=0.305 and the effect of affective prejudice improvement was reduced to a trend, B=0.420, p=0.074. The regressions indicate that affective prejudice improvement significant ly predicts forgiveness improvement in the training group and the mixed technique group. This suggests that the training technique may be changing forgiveness scores via affective prejudice or vice versa. Furthermore, Q 2 affective prejudice scores predict improvement in the training group and dialogue group. This suggests that, for the training and dialogue groups, participants with high affective prejudice scores before entering into the workshops will increase their forgiveness scores to a greater extent than those with low affective prejudice scores. In the training group, Q2 affective prejudice scores were correlated with affective prejudice improvement sc ores, meaning that participants with high affective prejudice scores improved mor e in the training groups. This relationship makes it difficult to disentangle the three-way relationship between affective prejudice improvement, pre- workshop affective prejudice scores and forgiveness improvement. However, in one of our regressions, Q2 affective prejudice scores were entered as a second step and explained significantly more variance in the training group. This suggests that Q2 affective prejudice scores are a better predictor of forgiveness improvement, compared to affective prejudice improvement. 150 Healing Summary: The original hypothesis was that dialogue-based contact would increase individual healing as measured by PTSD, depression and anxiety symptoms, in a post- conflict context. The results of this experiment disconfirm this hypothesis, a s we found that workshops that incorporated the training technique, including both training and mixed method workshops, were most effective at improving PTSD symptoms, while the dialogue workshops produced no significant improvement. Moreover, we saw no change in depression or anxiety symptoms as a result of the workshops, suggesting that the training and mixed method workshops specifically improved PTSD symptoms, but not other measures of psychological distress. Chapter 5 will explore why this may be the case. Results-Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): Given that the dialogue-based workshops encourage story-telling elements that resemble conventional psychotherapy, we chose to examine the hypothesis that some of the workshop groups would alleviate the symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), a s measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire (HTQ). We therefore ran the 2x2x2x2 mix ed model ANOVA described above. The results of the mixed model ANOVA and the follow-up tests described below provide strong evidence that the workshops that incorporated the training technique (including both the training and mixed-method workshops) produced the greatest reduction in symptoms of PTSD. This is evident from the following: The mixed model ANOVA showed a main effect of session , F(1, 86)=8.875, p=0.004, in which the means indicate that PTSD scores decreased from before 151 the workshops (Q2 mean=42.62) to after the workshops (Q3 mean=39.02). Additionally, we found a significant interaction between session and training technique , F(1, 86)=7.417, p=0.008, in which the means indicate that the training groups improved more from before the workshops (Q2 mean=46.56) to after the workshops (Q3 mean=39.67) than groups that did not employ the training technique, which did not improve from before (Q2 mean=38.68) to after the workshops (Q3 mean=38.37). We then examined each of the 7 individual workshop groups separately, and explored the hypothesis that one individual group was driving this effect. We used a univariate ANOVA to further test for effects of the individual workshop groups 1-9 using the same process that we used to look at the effect of trust on each individual workshop group. We first calculated a new variable measuring PTSD improvement by subtracting PTSD scores at Q3 from PTSD scores at Q2. We then ran the univariate ANOVA on the improvement in PTSD, including individual workshop groups 1-9 and participant identity group in the model. We found that the overall model was significant, F(13, 80)=1.900, p=0.042, indicating that our independent variables (the independent workshop groups) explained a significant amount of variance overall, but the main effect of workshop group was reduced to a non-significant trend, F(6, 80) = 2.059, p=0.067. The main effect of identity group was not significant, F(1, 80) = 2.159, p=0.146. Similarly, the interaction between identity group and workshop group was not significant, F(6, 80)=1.349, p=0.246. We hypothesize that the main effect of workshop group was reduced to a non-significant trend because of the reduced power that occurred when we broke down our larger technique groups. These results 152 indicate that no single group was driving the overall effect of the training group. However, because we had previously stated that all of the groups that used the training technique (training and mixed method groups) exhibited a significant change in PTSD symptoms, we still continued to explore the differences between the workshop groups. To that end, we then ran an LSD post-hoc test to examine the differences in PTSD improvement for the individual workshop groups (1-9). Our results indicate that training group 1 (mean=4.119, p=0.023), training group 4 (mean=6.343, p=0.031), mixed group 7 (mean=12.786, p=0.004) and mixed group 8 (mean=4.697, p=0.010) all significantly differed from control group 9 (mean=-1.482), indicating that these treatments (the training and mixed method workshops) were all effective at reducing PTSD symptoms. No dialogue only group significantly differed from the control group or any of the training groups. These data suggest that PTSD scores improved the most within the groups that incorporated the training methodology, i.e., training groups (groups 1 and 4) and mixed method groups (groups 7 and 8). This effect was not mitigated in groups 7 and 8, which also utilized the dialogue technique, suggesting that while a pure dialogue workshop is not effective for reducing PTSD, workshops that combine dialogue and training methods are effective. This indicates that at least some trainin g techniques are necessary for reducing PTSD. Regressions: Overall, the most robust finding of the PTSD regressions is that participants with high initial levels of empathy do worse on PTSD improvement than others, while individuals with low affective empathy seem to be improving in the 153 workshops, though this is true only in the training workshops. Given that affective empathy did not significantly improve in any of the groups, we hypothesize that improvement in PTSD symptoms may be driving some secondary improvement in affective empathy. We reached these conclusions based on the following: We first explored the hypothesis that pre-workshop affective empathy score s predicted PTSD improvement. After running a linear regression, the model trended toward significance, F(1, 92)=3.439, p=0.067, r 2=0.036 with beta values indicating that affective empathy negatively predicts PTSD improvement, B=-0.725, suggesting that participants with high initial levels of empathy do worse on PTSD improvement than others. We then split the file by the technique used in each workshop group (dialogue, training, mixed methods and control) to explore the possibility that this trend was being driven by one or more workshop groups. We re-ran a regression with affective empathy predicting improvement in PTSD symptoms. We found that affective empathy did not predict PTSD improvement in the control group, dialogue groups or mixed method groups. However, affective empathy did predict PTSD improvement in the training group, F(1, 20)=4.935, p=0.038, r 2=0.198, with beta values indicating that affective empathy negatively predicted PTSD improvement. This indicates that the participants who are improving within the training workshop are individuals with low affective empathy. We then hypothesized that PTSD symptom improvement may also effect change in affective empathy. We therefore chose to explore the hypothesis tha t affective empathy improvement scores could predict PTSD improvement scores. To test this we ran a regression predicting PTSD improvement with 154 affective empathy improvement. The overall model was significant, F(1, 92)=9.147, p=0.003, r 2=0.090, with beta values suggesting that affective empathy improvement positively predicted PTSD improvement, B=1.636. We then split the file into four groups (training, dialogue, mixed methods and control groups), and examined the possibility that affective empathy improvement as predicting improvement for each technique. For the dialogue group and mixed technique groups, the models were not significant. However, the control group exhibited a trend toward a significant model, F(1, 30)=3.673, p=0.065, r 2=0.109, with beta values suggesting a negative relationship between the two values, B=-2.225. The training group also exhibited a trend toward a significant model, F(1, 20)=4.226, p=0.053 with beta values suggesting a positive relationship between these two values, B=2.498. Based on previous analyses, we knew that PTSD symptoms differentially improved in groups 1, 4 and 7, where training was the predominant technique utilized. We therefore chose to re-divide our groups to analyze only groups 1, 4 and 7 and re-ran the regression with affective empathy improvement predicting PTSD improvement. It is important to point out that the \"training only\" group included only groups 1 and 4, so the power of this analysis should increase modestly. The overall model was significant, F(1, 29)=8.768, p=0.006, r 2=0.232, with beta values suggesting a positive relationship between improvement in empathy and improvement in PTSD, B=3.432. This suggests that affective empathy improvement is related to PTSD improvement. Given that affective empathy did not significantly improve in any of the groups, we hypothesize 155 that improvement in PTSD symptoms may be driving some secondary improvement in affective empathy. Finally, we also found the following weak or non-significant results: Neither contact, number of dependents, income or amount of education significantly predicted PTSD improvement. When all of the variables were included in the regression, the overall model was not significant, F(4, 84)= 0.682, p=0.607. Nor did any of the dependent variables significantly predict improvement in PTSD. Wartime experiences did not predict improvement in PTSD symptoms as overall regression model was not significant. Wartime experiences also did not predict pre-workshop PTSD scores, as the overall model was also not significant. Pre-workshop affective prejudice scores predict improvement in PTSD scores, an effect that seems to be primarily driven by the training group. This suggests that those who enter the workshops with high affective prejudice show more improvement in PTSD symptoms. We found evidence of this by exploring the hypothesis that pre-workshop (Q2) affective prejudice scores significantly predict improvement in PTSD scores. After running a linear regression, the overall model was significant, F(1, 92)=5.186, p=0.025, r 2=0.043, but the r- value was low indicating that the model does not explain much of the variation. Despite the low r-value, we chose to investigate the possibility tha t one workshop technique was driving this relationship more than the other. However, when we split the file into 4 groups to account for the dialogue, training, mixed methods and control groups, and ran a regression predicting 156 PTSD improvement with pre-workshop affective prejudice scores, none of the regressions reached the threshold for significance, but the training group exhibited a non-significant trend, F(1, 20)=3.312, p=0.084. Here, pre- workshop affective prejudice scores positively predicted PTSD improvement, B=0.956. Depression: We examined the hypothesis that some of the workshop groups would alleviate symptoms of depression, as measured by questions 11-25 on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist. To do so, we ran the mixed model ANOVA described above. We found no significant interaction between either of the workshop techniques and session, indicating that none of the workshop techniques affected depression symptoms. We also did not find any significant main effect of group for either the dialogue technique or the interaction between training and dialogue technique, nor was there a significant interaction between any of the workshop techniques w ith identity group. However, we did find a main effect of session, indicating a change f or all subjects regardless of group, F(1,82)=8.111, p=0.006, which cannot be attributed to the workshop techniques themselves because the control group also showed improvement. Regressions: Our most interesting finding is that depression scores improved more in participants who had higher initial rankings of psychopathology (PTSD, depression and anxiety). As seen below, this is evidenced by the fact that pre-workshop measurements of PTSD, depression and anxiety predicted improvement in depressi on. Pre-workshop PTSD scores significantly predicted depression improvement 6.542, p=0.012, r 2=0.072, with beta values (B=0.095) indicating a positive relationship. 157 Additionally, pre-workshop depression scores significantly predicted depression improvement F(1, 89)= 14.006, p<0.001, r 2=0.136, with beta values (B=0.247) indicating a positive relationship. Pre-workshop anxiety scores also trended toward a significant prediction of depression improvement, F(1, 89)= 2.947, p=0.090, r 2=0.032, with beta values (B=0.123) indicating a positive relationship. Additionally, we found that improvement in depression is positively correlated with improvement in affective empathy and to a lesser extent with pre-workshop cogni tive empathy. Similar to improvement in PTSD symptoms, improvement in affective empathy significantly predicted improvement in depression symptoms, as shown by the model, F(1, 89)= 8.553, p=0.004, r 2=0.088, with the beta values (B=0.904) indicating a positive relationship. Pre-workshop cognitive empathy trended toward a significant prediction of improvement in depression, as shown by the model, F(1, 89)= 3.657, p=0.059, r 2=0.039, with the beta values (B=0.752) indicating a positive relationship. We also found the following non-significant results: Neither contact, number of dependents, income or amount of education significantly predicted depression improvement. When all of the variables were included in the regression, the overall model was not significant, F(4, 80)= 0.494, p=0.740. None of the individual variables significantly predicted improvement in depression. None of our dependent variables predicted improvement in depression. Using a linear regression, we determined that improvement in behavioral, affective and cognitive prejudice did not predict improvement in depression. 158 Furthermore, improvement in tolerance, trust, and forgiveness also failed to predict improvement in depression. Similarly pre-workshop affective empathy, tolerance, trust, and forgiveness failed to predict depression improvement; neither did behavioral, affective or cognitive prejudice. Anxiety: After adding up the positive responses on questions 1-10 of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, we examined the hypothesis that some of the workshop groups would alleviate symptoms of anxiety by running the mixed model ANOVA described above. Overall, we did not see improvement in anxiety symptoms due to the workshop groups as evidenced by the fact that there was no interaction between session a nd workshop group, nor any interaction between session and identity group. Also, there was no three-way interaction between session, treatment group and identity group. The results from the Depression and Anxiety scores were surprising becaus e depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms are usually correlated with one another, but instead we found an improvement in PTSD scores, but not in depression and anxiety. To check this, we ran three Pearson correlations to examine the possibility that our scales did not correlate. Using the pre-workshop scores for each scale, PTSD positively correlated with both anxiety, r=.617, p<0.001, and depression, r=.788, p<0.001. Additionally, the anxiety scale positively correlated with depression, r=0.583, p<0.001. This means that all three of our measures of psychological distres s positively correlate with one another. Subsequently, we would expect the workshops to improve \"healing\" because we would expect all three scales to improve. However, only PTSD scores differentia lly improved in the workshop groups over the control group. These results suggest that 159 the workshop groups, especially the training based workshop groups, specifically improved PTSD symptoms and not other measures of psychological distress. Chapter 5 will discuss why this may be the case. Regressions: Similar to the regressions for depression, we found that anxiety scores improved more in participants who had higher initial rankings of psychopathology (higher PTSD, depression and anxiety scores before the workshops). We found that pre-workshop measurements of psychopathology predicted improvement in anxiety as shown below: Pre-workshop PTSD scores significantly predicted anxiety improvement F( 1, 92)= 14.589, p<0.001, r 2=0.137, with beta values (B=0.176) indicating a positive relationship. Pre-workshop depression scores also predicted anxiety improvement, F(1, 91)= 5.320, p=0.023, r 2=0.055, with beta values (B=0.180) indicating a positive relationship. Pre-workshop anxiety scores also predicted anxiety improvement F(1, 99)= 88.970, p<0.001, r 2=0.473, with beta values (B=0.587) indicating a positive relationship. Additionally, as was the case for PTSD and depression symptoms, we found improvement in anxiety to be positively correlated with improvement in affecti ve empathy and to a lesser extent with improvement in forgiveness based on the following evidence: Improvement in affective empathy significantly predicted improvement in anxiety, as indicated by the model, F(1, 99)= 6.944, p=0.010, r 2=0.066, with 160 the beta values (B=0.957) indicating a positive relationship. This means that people who improved in affective empathy also improved in anxiety. Additionally, improvement in forgiveness trended toward a significant prediction of improvement in anxiety, as indicated by the model, F(1, 97)= 3.181, p=0.078, r 2=0.032, with the beta values (B=0.502) indicating a positive relationship, suggesting that people who improved in forgiveness also improved in anxiety. Finally, we found the following non-significant results: Neither contact, number of dependents, income or amount of education significantly predicted anxiety improvement. When all of the variables were included in the regression, the overall model was not significant, F(4, 90)= 0.147, p=0.964. None of the individual variables significantly predicted improvement in anxiety. Improvement in other dependent variables did not predict improvement in anxiety. Using a linear regression, we determined that improvement in affective, cognitive and behavioral prejudice did not predict improvement in anxiety. Furthermore, improvement in tolerance, trust and cognitive empathy also failed to predict improvement in anxiety. Similarly pre-workshop affective empathy, cognitive empathy, tolerance, trust, and forgiveness als o failed to predict depression improvement, as did affective, cognitive and behavioral prejudice. Attitudes Toward Reconciliation Summary: As part of a short series of questions designed to capture any shifts in opinions participants hold about current events and political issues, we examined 161 whether participants' opinions about the importance of reconciliation changed during the workshops. We found a trend toward a significant improvement in participant opinions about the importance of reconciliation. However, we were surprised to find that eight participants decreased the importance they placed on reconciliati on following the workshops. After probing to understand the characteristics of these negative responders, we found that participants with higher initial depression and PTSD symptoms, but not necessarily anxiety symptoms, are more likely to beli eve that reconciliation is less important after participating in the workshop groups. Results: In an effort to capture any potential societal effects of the workshops, we asked participants several questions about their views on current events and politic al issues. Of those questions, the only one that showed improvement was the question about reconciliation, which asked participants \"Do you think it's important to repair relationships between groups?\" We used a Wilcoxon sign rank test to evaluate the change in participants and found a trend toward a significant improvement over time, Z= -1.860, p=0.063, with 18 participants increasing their rank, 8 decreasing their rank and 76 participants reporting the same rank of importance. Although only a minority of participants decided that reconciliation was less important after the workshops, we found it surprising that there were any. We therefore tried to identify any psychometric asse ssments that may distinguish these participants from those who were positively or neutrally infl uenced by the workshops with regard to reconciliation. We found that the participants who ranked reconciliation as less important after t he workshops entered the workshops with higher PTSD and depression scores. We reached this conclusion based on the steps and the evidence detailed below: 162 We first created a new grouping variable based on whether a participant regarded reconciliation as more important (positive responders), less important (negative responders) or those who did not change (non-responders). We then hypothesized that the reconciliation responder groups may differ in pre-workshop group psychopathology ratings. We therefore assessed symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety using a one-way ANOVA and Scheffe post-hoc tests. PTSD: To assess the impact of PTSD symptoms, we ran a one-way ANOVA using the above-defined reconciliation groups as a grouping variable and PTSD scores as a dependent variable. The ANOVA was significant, F(2, 94)= 5.316, p=0.007, with Scheffe post hoc tests indicating that the negative responders (M=60.57) exhibited higher PTSD symptoms than both the non-responders (M=41.25), p=0.015 and the positive responders (M=36.87), p=0.008. There was no significant difference between positive responders and non-responders, p=0.631. We then hypothesized that PTSD symptoms at Q2 may directly predict the change in reconciliation, so we ran a simple linear regression, predicting reconciliation change from Q2 to Q3 with PTSD symptoms. The overall ANOVA was significant, F(1, p=0.002, r 2=0.094, with the beta values (B= -0.011) suggesting an inverse relationship between PTSD symptoms at Q2 and change in the perceived importance of reconciliation. We further hypothesized that PTSD symptoms could predict the initial perceived importance of reconciliation, which we examined with a linear 163 regression. However, the overall model was not significant, F(1, 96)=0.168, p=0.469. This suggests that PTSD symptoms are a good predictor of the change in perceived reconciliation importance, but not initial rankings of the same measure. Depression: To assess the impact of depression symptoms, we ran a one-way ANOVA using the above-defined reconciliation groups as a grouping variable and depression scores as a dependent variable. The ANOVA was significant, F(2, 92)= 5.587, p=0.005, with Scheffe post hoc tests indicating that the negative responders (M=35.28) exhibited higher depression symptoms than both non responders, (M=24.19) p=0.014 and (M=21.61) positive responders, p=0.006. There was no significant difference between positive responders and negative responders, p=0.582. We then hypothesized that depression at Q2 may directly predict the change in reconciliation, so we ran a simple linear regression, predicting reconcili ation change from Q2 to Q3 with depression symptoms. overall ANOVA was significant, F(1, 91)=6.242, p=0.014, r 2=0.064, with the beta values (B= - 0.016) suggesting an inverse relationship between depression symptoms at Q2 and change in the perceived importance of reconciliation, suggesting that people with higher levels of depression symptoms responded negatively to the workshops. We further hypothesized that depression symptoms could predict the initial perceived importance of reconciliation, which we examined with a linear regression. However, the overall model was not significant, F(1, 94)=0.266, 164 p=0.607. This suggests that depression symptoms are a good predictor of the change in perceived reconciliation importance, but not initial rankings of the same measure. Anxiety: To assess the impact of anxiety symptoms, we ran a one-way ANOVA using the above-defined reconciliation groups as a grouping variable and anxiety scores as a dependent variable. The ANOVA was not significant, F(2, 98)= 2.148, p=0.122. It is possible that we did not find increased Q2 anxiety scores in negative responders because the low N in the negative responders group decreased the power of our analysis. So, we explored the possibility that the anxiety scores can predict the change in the perceived importance of reconciliation. We therefore ran a simple linear regression, predicting reconciliation change from Q2 to Q3 with anxiety symptoms. The overall ANOVA was not significant, F(1, 99)=2.417, p=0.123, suggesting that there is no relationship between anxiety symptoms at Q2 and change in the perceived importance of reconciliation. We further hypothesized that anxiety symptoms could predict the initial perceived importance of reconciliation, which we examined with a linear regression. However, the overall model was not significant, F(1, 102)=0.059, p=0.808. This suggests that anxiety symptoms are not a good overall predictor of the initial scores of, or the change in, the perceived importance of reconciliation. 165 Overall, these results suggest that participants with higher initial depre ssion and PTSD symptoms, but not necessarily anxiety symptoms, are more likely to beli eve that reconciliation is less important after participating in the workshop groups . Regressions: We chose to explore the hypothesis that we could predict participant's change in opinion about the importance of reconciliation using our dependent variables. Using a linear regression, we determined that improvement in behavior al and cognitive prejudice did not predict improvement in anxiety. Furthermore, improvement in tolerance, trust, affective empathy and cognitive empathy a lso failed to predict change in reconciliation. Additionally, no pre-workshop scores significa ntly predicted reconciliation improvement. However, improvement in affective prejudice significantly predicted chan ge in reconciliation opinion, as indicated by the model, F(1, 100)= 5.627, p=0.020, r2=0.053, with the beta values (B=0.039) indicating a positive relationship. Additionally, improvement in affective empathy trended toward a significant prediction of change in reconciliation opinion, as indicated by the model, F(1, 100)= 3.469, p=0.065, r 2=0.034, with the beta values (B=0.052) indicating a positive relationship. Overall, these results suggest that reconciliation scores improve d more in participants who also improved in affective prejudice or affective empathy. Contact Summary: Because of the large volume of research suggesting that intergroup contact leads to lower prejudice, and higher trust and forgiveness, we examined the relationship between initial levels of contact and our dependent variables\u2014both before and after the workshops. Surprisingly, we found no relationship between initial levels of contact and prejudice, trust, tolerance, forgiveness or healing. Howeve r, we 166 found a strong relationship between contact and empathy. As discussed in the section on empathy above, we therefore expected to see a similar relationship betwe en contact in the workshop setting and improvement in empathy scores, but instead we found that people who enter the workshops with higher levels of contact and therefore empathy, do worse in empathy improvement than those who enter with less interaction with members of the outgroup. While more research is needed to determine the precise meaning of these results, one explanation may be that empa thy is a moderator of other variables such as prejudice and healing. Results: We explored the hypothesis that the quality and quantity of contact with members of the outgroup before the workshop would predict initial levels of our dependent variables (prejudice, empathy, trust, tolerance, forgiveness and heali ng) or the improvement in these variables. Using a linear regression, we found that cont act at Q2 did not predict initial levels of affective prejudice, F(1,103)=1.888, cognitive (1,103)=0.039, p=0.844. We also found that contact did not predict improvement in affective prejudice, F(1,101)=0.001, p=0.976; cognitive p=0.577. However, as described above in the section on empathy, we found that Q2 contact scores positively predicted Q2 cognitive empathy, F(1,103)=17.134, p<0.001, r 2 167 =0.143, B=0.922, Q2 affective before the workshops, F(1,103)=8.232, p=0.005, r 2 =0.74, B=0.411 with a stronger relationship toward cognitive over affective empathy. As discussed in the section on empathy above, this suggests that people with more contact with the outgroup, have more affective and cognitive empathy for that group. However, we also found that contact measures positively predicted improvement in tolerance, F(1,100)=4.317, p=0.040, r 2 =0.041, B=0.570, but negatively predicted trust r 2 and cognitive empathy, F(1,100)=7.122, p=0.009, r 2 =0.066, B=-0.609.These results suggest that while more initial contact with members of the outgroup predicts improvement in tolerance during the workshops, it does not predict a reduction of prejudice, or an increase in empathy, forgiveness or healing. Moreover, initial levels of contact negati vely predict improvement in trust and cognitive empathy, meaning that people who have more contact with members of the outgroup before the workshops improve less on trust and cognitive empathy in the workshops. Conclusion Overall, the results of this study confirm previous research suggesting tha t intergroup contact can increase prejudice, trust, forgiveness and healing in a post-conflic t context. As shown in Table 8 below, we found that a dialogue technique that integrates elements of participant storytelling is most effective at decreasing prejudice and increasing forgiveness, while the training technique was most effective at reducing symptoms of PTSD and modestly increasing trust. However, these findings should be treated with caut ious optimism as the effect sizes are relatively small and the study was subject to s everal sources of bias as described in Chapter 3. Because this is the f contact techniques on a broad range of dependent variables more research is needed to confirm most effective at promoting intergroup reconciliation.

It will attempt to explain the results of the stud y and identify gaps in the literature where uncertainty remains. The conclusion will discuss t he implications of these results for both theory and practice, and suggest an agend a for future research. Throughout, this chapter seeks to demonstrate that while the results of this experi ment are modest, there is reason for cautious optimism that intergroup contact programs may have an important role to play in encouraging post-conflict reconciliat ion. As seen in chapter four, the dialogue methodology was the most effective at reduci ng prejudice and increasing forgiveness for participants regardless of identi ty group. The training workshops also saw moderate success in increasing trust and signif icant success at improving symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) . Moreover, while we did not see a significant improvement in empathy as a result of the workshops, improvement in affective empathy positively predicted improvement in prejudice and healing, suggesting that empathy may be mediating the r elationship between facilitated contact and improvement in prejudice and healing. Tolerance was the only variable for which we have no significant findings. While this chapter will seek to explain the nuance of these results, the overall fi ndings suggest that facilitated intergroup contact has the potential not only to reduce prejudice, but to increase trust, forgiveness and healing. To be sure, more re search is needed to determine the best methods for maximizing the effects of this work. 170 However, this study provides some of the first evidence that the effects of fac ilitated intergroup contact can translate into the highly-charged context of post-conflict societies and that \"the findings obtained under relatively benign conditions of intergroup relations between experimentally created groups in the laboratory ca n be generalized to real-world social groups with a history of conflict and hostilit y, inequalities of status and power, and political struggle\".192 Prejudice This study shows that all three contact techniques\u2014training, dialogue and mixe d- methods-- were effective in reducing affective prejudice, regardless of t he participant's identity group. However, we saw no corresponding change in cogniti ve or behavioral prejudice. These results strongly reinforce existing liter ature, which suggests that affective dimensions of prejudice (feelings and emotional response s toward the outgroup) may be more strongly affected by contact than cognitive dimensions of prejudice (perceptions and beliefs about the outgroup). When Allport originally posited the contact hypothesis, he proposed that knowledge was the mediating factor linking contact to a reduction of prejudice. 193 He claimed that intergroup contact facilitated learning about the outgroup, and this new knowledge in turn reduced prejudice. However, as contact research continues to grow, new research indicates that affective components of prejudice such as liking, a nxiety and empathy/perspective-taking may be more strongly affected by contact than the perceptions, judgments, and beliefs that form the basis of cognitive prejudice. 194 192 Brewer and Gaertner, \"Toward Reduction of Prejudic e: Intergroup Contact and Social Categorization,\" 301. 193 Allport, The Nature of Prejudice . Ashmore and Del Boca, \"Conceptual approa to stereotypes and stereotyping,\" in Cognitive processes in stereotyping and intergroup behavior , ed. D.L. Hamilton (Hillsdale, NJ: 171 For example, social psychology has repeatedly shown that greater exposure to targe ts can, in and of itself, significantly enhance liking for those targets, a main com ponent of affective prejudice. 195 Moreover, studies with social targets have shown that the enhanced liking that results from exposure can generalize to greater liking f or other related, yet previously unknown, social targets. 196 Pettigrew and Tropp note that if this work on exposure is applied to contact theory, it implies that all things being equal, greater contact and familiarity with members of other groups should enhance liking for those groups, possibly explaining why Allport's conditions of contact do not prove to be essential for positive effects of contact to emerge. 197 Moreover, Stangor et al. have posited that affective components may be stronger determinants of prejudice than cognitive components because affective responses are based on direct and therefore highly self-relevant experiences with the target group members, whereas stereotypes may often be learned from secondary sources . 198 To the extent that direct, self-relevant experiences produce stronger a ttitudinal responses in comparison to indirect experience, then affect would be expected to be a strong predictor of prejudice.199 This may explain why the dialogue technique produced greater improvements in affective prejudice than either the training or mix ed method Erlbaum, 1981); I.

The results of this study therefore lend strong support to research showing tha t contact has a more significant effect on affective rather than cognitive components of prejudice. It also supports research suggesting that affective components of pr ejudice are reduced through direct, self-relevant experiences with members of the outgroup. While it is the work of future research to demonstrate whether sustained contac t, or repeated contact in a facilitated setting can begin to break down the cognitive a nd behavioral components of prejudice, this work suggests that the more intimate environment of a dialogue-based workshop is likely to produce greater gains on prejudice reduction than less personal training-based methodologies. Empathy This study hypothesized that facilitated contact would lead to an increase in empa thy, both affective and cognitive, for participants. However, we found no evidence of any significant increase in empathy as a result of the workshops. Yet, we found tha t empathy may be mediating, or enabling, the relationship between contact and variables such as prejudice, forgiveness, trust, tolerance and healing. Specifically, we found evidence that empathy may be mediating the relat ionship between prejudice and healing in the fact that while the workshops did not produce a significant improvement in empathy, they did lead to significant improvements in prejudice and healing, which in turn were predicted by improvement in affecti ve empathy. This linkage supports the idea that affective empathy may be mediati ng the 173 relationship between facilitated contact and improvement in prejudice and heal ing, and is in line with previous studies, which show that affective factors such as empat hy and anxiety mediate the contact-prejudice relationship. 200 Other research is also showing that contact with the outgroup in the form of close cross-group relationships can be highly effective in reducing intergroup prejudice201 to the extent that these relationships encourage empathy with outgroup members. 202 For example, Voci and Hewstone have shown intergroup contact with immigrants in Italy to be positively associated with empathy for immigrants, which in turn was positively associated with outgroup attitudes toward immigrants and negati vely associated with subtle prejudice against immigrants. 203 Other work has demonstrated that empathy mediates the contact-prejudice relationship in post-conflict societies such as Northern Ireland 204 and South Africa. 205 In addition, Hewstone et al. have found significant positive correlations not only between contact and prejudice, but between contact with outgroup friends and 200 Miles Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup Contact in a Di vided Society: Challenging Segregation in Northern Ireland,\" in The Social Psychology of Inclusion and Exclusion , ed.

This implies that people with more contact with the outg roup have greater initial levels of empathy for that group. Further, we found that ini tial levels of empathy predicted initial levels of contact, prejudice, trust and forgi veness, providing further support for the idea that empathy may be mediating the relat ionship between contact and prejudice, trust and forgiveness. Finally, we found that initial levels of outgroup contact did not predict improvement in prejudice, affective empathy, forgiveness, PTSD, depression or anxiety. How ever, we found that initial levels of outgroup contact positively predicted improvement in tolerance, but negatively predicted improvement in trust and cognitive empathy . Similarly, we also found that initial levels of empathy for the outgroup negativel y predicted improvement in both cognitive and affective empathy during the workshops. This means that people who entered the workshops with higher initial levels of 206 Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup Contact, Forgiveness, and Experience of \"The Troubles\" in Northern Ireland.\" 207 Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup Contact in a Divided Society: Challenging Segregation in Northern Ireland.\" 175 outgroup contact and greater empathy toward the outgroup, improved on tolerance toward the outgroup, but got slightly worse on measures of trust, affective and cognitive empathy as a result of the workshops. These results suggest that th ere may be a ceiling effect occurring with regard to empathy and trust for partici pants who enter the workshops with high levels of preexisting contact, and therefore high le vels of empathy for the outgroup such that we should not expect high empathy individuals to become more empathetic or trusting as a result of contact. This indicates t hat facilitated intergroup contact may be better suited to participants with le ss preexisting contact, and therefore lower initial levels of empathy for the outgroup. While more research is needed to determine whether empathy is indeed mediating the relationship between contact and improvement in variables such as prejudice, trust, forgiveness and healing, this study supports the growing body of research suggest ing that empathy may play a strong mediating role in the relationship between conta ct and variables thought to contribute to reconciliation. Moreover, it suggests that while empathy may not change directly as a result of contact interventions, it may be mediating, or supporting an erosion of prejudice and an improvement of trust, forgiveness and healing. Forgiveness In contrast to Hewstone et al., who found that forgiveness was positively associated with trust, perspective taking, outgroup attitudes, and contact with outgroup friends in the context of Northern Ireland, we did not find a relationship between pre-workshop 176 levels of forgiveness, trust, empathy (perspective taking) or contact wi th the outgroup. 208 However, we did find a relationship between facilitated contact and forgiveness, a s the dialogue and mixed methods workshops lead to a significant improvement in forgiveness for both GAM and PETA participants. 209 In addition, we found that participants who had higher affective prejudice scores before undergoing the workshops improved more on forgiveness scores in the dialogue and training groups, suggesting that participants with higher initial levels of prejudice may ben efit most from intergroup workshops in terms of improving forgiveness. The psychological link between forgiveness and prejudice is perhaps unsurprisi ng as forgiveness requires a modification of attitude or emotional responses, and prejudi ce is considered an attitude. 210 While more research is needed to disentangle the precise relationship between forgiveness and outgroup attitudes, the fact that affective prejudice improvement significantly predicts forgiveness improvement in the tr aining and mixed technique groups suggests that the training technique may be changing forgiveness scores via affective prejudice or vice versa. One possible explanation of why the workshops increased forgiveness is that they were facilitating a reduction of anger. While we did not measure anger dir ectly in this study, previous studies have shown that the decision to forgive is associated with the 208 Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup Contact, Forgiveness, and Experience of \"The Troubles\" in Northern Ireland.\": 114 209 The training workshops resulted in an improvement in forgiveness for GAM, but not for PETA. 210 E.D. Scobie and \"Damaging events: T he Perceived need for forgiveness,\" Journal for the theory of social behavior 28(1998); Janice Haaken, \"The good, the bad, and t he ugly: Psychoanalytic and cultural perspectives on forgive ness,\" in Before forgiving: cautionary views of forgiveness in psychotherapy , ed. Sharon Lamb and Jeffrie G. Murphy (Oxford: Ox ford University Press, 2002), 182. 177 release of feelings of anger and revenge towards the offender. 211 ehaji , Brown et al. also similarly found that intergroup forgiveness involves a reduction of feelings of revenge, anger and mistrust toward the perpetrator group and intentions to understand, approach and engage with its members. 212 As will be seen in the section on healing, a reduction of anger may be mediating not only improvement in forgiveness, but a reduction of PTSD symptoms as well. Trust While we found that the training groups produced a statistically significant improvement in trust, this change may not be clinically significant as the mea ns improved by only 0.54 points on the trust scale. While previous research in Northern Ireland has indicated that both direct and indirect intergroup contact are positively associated with outgroup trust 213 and outgroup trust is positively associated with positive behavioral action tendencies toward the outgroup, we found only moderate evidence to support this. 214 One explanation for this difference may be the fact that the research in Nort hern Ireland focused solely on preexisting contact with members of the outgroup, while this study looks at the effects of both preexisting as well as facilitate d intergroup contact. As such, it is possible that the effects of preexisting contact are mor e potent 211 Michael E.; Fincham McCullough, Frank D.; Tsang, J o-Ann \"Forgiveness, forbearance, time: The temporal unfolding of transgression-related int erpersonal motivations,\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 84, no. 3 (2003); R.D. & the Human Development Stu dy Group Enright, \"The moral development of forgiveness,\" in Handbook of moral behavior and development , ed. W. Kurtines and J. Gerwitz (Hillsdale, NJ: Emanuele Castano, \"Forgive and forget? Antecedents and consequences of intergroup forgiveness in Bosnia an d Herzegovina,\" Political Psychology 29, no. 3 (2008). 213 Myers, Hewstone, and Cairns, \"Impact of conflict o n mental health in Northern Ireland: The mediating role of intergroup forgiveness and collec tive guilt..\"; T. Tam et al., \"Intergroup trust in Northern Ireland,\" Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 35(2009). 214 \u2014\u2014\u2014, \"Intergroup trust in Northern Ireland.\" 178 than those of facilitated contact and that it cannot be assumed that facilitate d contact will have the same trust-enhancing effects as preexisting contact. It is also possible that the observational methodology used in the Northern Ireland studies introduced a significant amount of bias into the study, such that the study results are overestimated. As Gerber, Green and Kaplan have suggested, the r isk of bias in observational research is typically much greater than in experim ental studies because while observational studies also examine the effects of variation in a set of independent variables, this variation is not generated through randomization procedures. 215 Subsequently, researchers have to make assumptions about the statistical relationship between observed and unobserved causes of the dependent variable, which increases the likelihood of producing inaccurate results. It is the refore possible that the Northern Ireland studies overestimated the effect of contact on trust and that the results we obtained under the experimental conditions of this study are a more precise measure of the effect of contact on trust. A third explanation may be that we should expect to see fewer gains in trust as t his study was conducted in the context of a developing country, Indonesia, while the Northern Ireland study is a case of a developed country with a more establishe d rule of law and less corruption. As Bo Rothstein explains, \"The problem of low interpersonal trust comes from discriminated groups having been forced to live under public institutions that have been, or which they have believed to be, deeply dysfunctional for them.\"216 He further notes that \"people who interpret life in terms of 215 Alan S. Gerber, Donald P. Green, and Edward H. Kap lan, \"The illusion of learning from observational research,\" in Problems and methods in the study of politics , ed. Ian Shapiro, Rogers Smith, and Tarek Massoud (New York: Cambridge Unive rsity Press, 2004), 251. Bo Rothstein, \"Social trust and honesty in governm ent: A causal mechanisms approach,\" in Creating social trust in post-socialist transitions , ed. Kornai, Bo Rothstein, and Susan Rose- Ackerman (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2004), 23. 179 corruption are not only likely to mistrust public authorities; they are also unlikel y to trust other people in general. The corruption of the authorities can thus be seen as a main source of social distrust.\" 217 It is possible that this theory explains why contact produced less trust in the context of Indonesia than Northern Ireland. A final explanation for the slight improvement in trust is that it is perhaps not surprising that we saw greater gains in prejudice and forgiveness than in trus t given that it may be easier to improve outgroup attitudes than it is to build trust. While prejudice and forgiveness may be considered outgroup attitudes, outgroup trust has been defined as a positive expectation about the intentions and behavior of an outgroup toward the ingroup. 218 Outgroup trust therefore requires ingroup members to make themselves vulnerable to the intentions of the outgroup, while outgroup attitudes such as prejudice and forgiveness do not. 219 As such, outgroup trust might be regarded as distinct from one's outgroup attitudes and far more difficult to achi eve than out-group liking, a key component of prejudice.220 One particular reason why outgroup trust may be more difficult to achieve than outgroup liking, or a reduction of prejudice, is that more effort is often required to establish trust than is required to destroy it. 221 Where it may require multiple positive encounters, or \"trustworthy\" behaviors, to build trust, it often requires only one \"untrustworthy\" act or betrayal to arouse distrust that is very resistant to c hange. 222 For this reason, the outgroup distrust stemming from a history of intergroup conflict 217 Ibid., 14. 218 R.J. relationships and realities,\" Academy of Management Review 23(1998). 219 Tam et al., \"Intergroup trust in Northern Ireland. \" 220 Hewstone et al., \"Intergroup forgiveness and guilt in Northern Ireland: Social psychological dimensions of \"The Troubles\".\" 221 Swart et al., \"Achieving forgiveness and trust in postconflict societies: The importance of self- disclosure and empathy.\": 192 222 M. Rothbart and B. Park, \"On the confirmability an d disconfirmability of trait concepts,\" Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 50(1986). 180 often remains evident in post-conflict societies long after the conflict it self has ended. 223 As such, it is possible to enhance outgroup liking, or reduce prejudice, while distrust of the outgroup remains prevalent. Lewicki and Wiethoff have argued that creating and maintaining mutual trust is essential for the establishment of positive intergroup relations because, as a process, trust building is capable of replacing suspicion, fear, and anger with benevolence and cooperation. 224 Trust allows suspicion and distrust of the outgroup, which is often characterized by self-imposed segregation or negative behaviors toward the outg roup, to be replaced with a greater willingness to engage with the outgroup in a coopera tive, constructive manner. 225 Lewicki and Wiethoff distinguish between calculus-based trust and identificati on- based trust. 226 Calculus-based trust is generally non-intimate and task-oriented, whereas identification-based trust is often more intimate in nature, relyi ng on a greater understanding and appreciation of the two parties' needs. Calculus-bas ed trust is often witnessed in the early stages of intimate, personal relationships, w hereas identification-based trust comes to the fore in relationships characteriz ed by greater closeness as the result of repeated self-disclosure, or the voluntary sharin g of personal information, which by its very nature requires a certain degree of trust in the pers on with whom this personal information is being shared. 227 While initial self-disclosures between individuals who are only beginning to get to know one another are bound to 223 e.g., Gibson, Overcoming apartheid: Can truth reconcile a divided nation? 224 R.J. Lewicki C. Wiethoff, repair,\" in The handbook of conflict resolution: Theory and practice , ed. M. Deutsch and P.T. Coleman (San Francisco, C A: Jossey-Bass, 2000). 225 and oup Blackwell handbook of social psychology: Intergroup processes , ed. R. \u2014\u2014\u2014, \"Trust, trust development, and trust repair.\" 227 R.E. Petty and H.L. Mirels, \"Intimacy and scarcity of self-disclosure: Effects on interpersonal attraction for males and females,\" Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin 7(1981). 181 be relatively superficial, requiring minimal trust, these self-disclos ures will become more intimate as the interpersonal relationship develops, requiring increasing ly more trust. It is therefore possible that the three-day workshop period was insufficient for participants to build identification-based trust, and that the small statisti cal gains we saw are attributable to an increase in calculus-based trust, but a continued lack of identification-based trust. This theory would suggest that repeated encounters w ith the same members of the outgroup would eventually result in an increase in trust score s. This theory strongly supports a second phase of this study that would bring participants together for a second and third round of contact to evaluate further changes to outgroup attitudes and trust. Moreover, while this study did not include separate measures of calculus-based or identification-based trust, future st udies could use a measure of trust that seeks to disaggregate the two to enhance understanding of how to increase trust. Healing Given that the dialogue-based workshops encourage story-telling elements t hat resemble conventional psychotherapy, I expected the dialogue groups to help alle viate symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety. Yet, surprisingly, it was the groups that used the training or mixed methods that alleviated some PTSD symptoms, with no significant difference between participants who identified with GAM or PET A. Also surprising was the fact that the training and mixed methods workshops alleviated PTSD symptoms but not depression or anxiety symptoms. This may be because the training and mixed methods workshops were tapping into constructs of anger management through a focus on conflict resolution techniques that 182 helped alleviate symptoms of anger for those suffering from PTSD. Anger is a distinct symptom of PTSD that exists less for those suffering from depression and is abse nt in those suffering from anxiety, which may explain why we saw a significant improvement in symptoms of PTSD, but not in symptoms of depression or anxiety. In his work treating Cambodian refugees, Devon Hinton, M.D., Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, has shown that anger plays an important role in the psychopathology of refugees suffering from PTSD, with pat ients with PTSD scoring significantly higher on the Anger Reaction Index. 228 In his clinical work, he has found that among other treatments, patients should be taught anger- management skills, including culturally consonant methods such as meditation and religious approaches. 229 It may be that the strong focus on conflict resolution techniques such as communication skills and \"local wisdom,\" or religious and cultur al approaches used by the facilitators to encourage a sense of commonality betwe en the participants served in part as anger management training. Interestingly, Hewstone et al. have found that intergroup contact positively predi cted empathy and out-group attitude, but negatively predicted a distinct intergroup emotions factor of anger-related emotions (angry, hatred, furious, irritate d), meaning that more contact predicted less anger.230 In turn, anger negatively predicted, and empathy positively predicted, forgiveness. These findings are in line with the explanation by Hinton that the training and mixed method workshops were tapping into constructs of anger management, and therefore alleviating symptoms of PTSD. However, this does not explain why the dialogue workshops did not produce the same 228 Devon E. Hinton et al., \"Anger, PTSD, and the nucl ear family: A study of Cambodian refugees,\" Social Science and Medicine 69(2009). 229 Ibid.: 1393 230 Hewstone et al., \"Stepping stones to reconciliatio n in Northern Ireland: Intergroup contact, forgiveness and trust.\" 183 effect. The fact that the dialogue-based workshops did not lead to an increase in healing for participants or alleviation of symptoms of PTSD, depression or anxiety may be explained by some key differences between the dialogue-based workshop and prolonged exposure therapy. Prolonged exposure therapy mainly consists of repeat ed imaginal exposure to the traumatic memory until the patient becomes distress ed. After months of weekly exposure the strong emotions associated with the traumatic event become extinguished. However, the treatment can be arduous and studies are beginning to show that ethnic minorities and refugees are even les s tolerant of this therapy than more educated Western populations. 231 Comparatively, the dialogue-based workshop groups may have exposed participants to traumatic memories, but not allowed for complete extinction of the strong emotions associat ed with the traumatic event. Another possible explanation may be that the storytelling methods used in the dialogue workshops invoked anxiety toward the outgroup, which acted as a counterweight to gains made in anger management. Storytelling relies heav ily on reciprocal self-disclosure in which participants share information about their experiences during the conflict or with the outgroup. While self-disclosure is a n important friendship-developing and trust-building mechanism 232 and proved to be effective at reducing prejudice and increasing forgiveness in this study, the danger of entering into group-level self-disclosure too early in the initial interact ions is that it may evoke negative responses, such as intergroup anxiety, that would lower the 231 K.; Resick Lester, P.A.; Young-Xu, Y.; Artz, C., \" Impact of race on early treatment termination and outcomes in posttraumatic stress disorder treatment ,\" Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 78(2010). 232 Thomas Pettigrew, F., \"Intergroup contact theory,\" Annual Review of Psychology 49(1998). 184 perceived quality of the contact experience. 233 While this does not seem to have been a problem for prejudice reduction, it may have had a negative impact on healing. It is possible that by incorporating more therapeutic principles into the dialogue workshops we can invoke an outcome that is positive for prejudice, forgiveness and healing. However more work is needed to determine the best methods for incorporating these principles. Tolerance The study showed no significant change in tolerance for any of the participants, regardless of group or workshop method. I thought perhaps this was due to the limited scale we used to measure tolerance, which used only three questions based on James Gibson's conceptualization of tolerance in South Africa as the commitment of pe ople to put up with each other, even those whose political ideas they thoroughly detest. On a four-point Likert scale, I therefore asked participants to rate the follow ing statements: Members of the outgroup should be prohibited from standing as a candidate for an elected position Members of the outgroup should be allowed to hold street demonstrations in your community The outgroup should be officially banned in your community However, the fact that responses to these questions did not significantly change throughout the workshops is reinforced by the fact that participant responses to the questions regarding social and political issues also did not show a significant chan ge. While these questions were initially intended to serve as a proxy for potential soc ietal- 233 R. Brown and M. Hewstone, \"An integrative theory o f intergroup contact,\" Advances in Experimental Psychology 37(2005). 185 level impact of the workshops, they could also be interpreted as an alternative way of measuring tolerance. Participants were asked to rate the extent to which t hey agreed with the following statements: 1. Do you agree that refugees/IDPs who fled the region during the conflict should return? 2. Do you agree that the return of refugees/IDPs to the region will cause violence? 3. Do you believe reconciliation between groups is important? Of these three questions, only opinions about the importance of reconciliation between groups showed a significant improvement as a result of the workshops. Indeed, the fact that attitudes toward reconciliation improved is not surprising, given that in all workshops, facilitators discussed the concept of reconciliation and repeatedly reiterated its importance. Moreover, all workshops ended with a disc ussion of what participants could do within their own communities to encourage reconciliation. As such, it would have been surprising if we didn't see significant gains on attitudes toward reconciliation. However, the fact that we didn't see a ny significant gains on the other two questions seems to confirm that there was no change in tolerance as a result of the workshops. One interesting caveat to our findings on reconciliation is that participants w ith higher initial depression and PTSD symptoms were more likely to believe that reconcil iation is less important after participating in the workshops. This finding is similar to that of Stover and Weinstein who also found that individuals who reported a high number of 186 traumatic experiences and had negative pre-war relationships with the opposing group were less open to reconciliation. 234 However, we also found that individuals who entered the workshops highly symptomatic of PTSD showed improvement in trust, PTSD, depression and anxiety scores. 235 On balance, it therefore seems that highly symptomatic individuals benefit from the workshops with the exception of improvement in attitudes toward reconciliation. As such, it may be that incorporating more of the training met hodology into the dialogue technique, with a particular focus on anger management techniques, would help improve attitudes toward reconciliation. Conclusion While the results of this study are modest, they do demonstrate that intergroup cont act can not only reduce prejudice, but increase trust, forgiveness and healing in post- conflict contexts. While it appears that dialogue-based facilitation met hodologies are the most effective for changing outgroup attitudes (prejudice and forgivenes s), training-based or mixed method workshops may be more effective at improving trust and alleviating PTSD symptoms. This suggests that in the future, a single workshop that incorporates elements of training, particularly those focused on anger management techniques may be able to produce a reduction of prejudice as well as a n increase in forgiveness, trust and healing. Importantly, this work also provides initial evidence that may contribute to building a theory of reconciliation as it a) provides the first empirical data on the effe cts of 234 Stover and Weinstein, My Neighbor, My Enemy: Justice and Community in the Aftermath of Mass Atrocity . 235 We know this because pre-workshop PTSD, depression and anxiety scores are correlated with post- workshop improvement in trust, forgiveness, PTSD, d epression and anxiety scores. 187 contact which can be built upon by other scholars to flesh out a theoretical framework for reconciliation, and b) indicates a potential sequencing of psychological cha nges that may occur as a result of contact. As discussed above, variables that requir e a modification of outgroup attitudes such as prejudice and forgiveness improved more after one contact session than trust. While this study found the effects of c ontact on trust to be minimal, it is possible that repeated contact between groups may deepen gains in trust. As such, future contact studies should attempt to measure the effec t of multiple meetings between groups that may allow participants the time and spa ce to develop intimate or identification-based trust and deepen gains in prejudice, forgiveness and healing. To reflect these theoretical contributions, I have modified the model developed in Chapter 2 to include a continuum of contact over time. Based on this research, it is possible that we should expect to see variables such as prejudice, forgiveness and healing change following initial contact sessions, and continue to improve with each additional experience of intergroup contact. Given the findings on trust, I propose that we might expect that trust would begin to improve slightly in the first contact s ession, but would gain momentum in subsequent interactions as calculus-based trust evolves into identification-based trust. As such, a theoretical model of reconciliation mi ght look like this: 188 While this diagram presents a proposed theoretical framework for reconcilia tion, more questions than answers remain and a robust research agenda will be the key to developing a better understanding of how to create the conditions for reconciliation. As such, I would like to propose several themes on which future research should focus: 1. Continue to examine the effects of intergroup contact not only on prejudice reduction, but on a range of variables that may prove critical to reconciliation such as forgiveness, empathy, trust, tolerance and healing. In particular , the relationship between empathy and contact needs to be better understood; 2. Expand the body of case studies that examine the effects of contact in conflict- affected societies; 3. Determine the best methods for facilitating intergroup contact. This should include testing the effect of incorporating more therapeutic methodologies into dialogue workshops to explore whether a mixed method workshop that is heavily based on dialogue can simultaneously produce a reduction of prejudice as well as an increase in forgiveness and improvement in PTSD symptoms. Therapeutic approaches that provide additional support for participants following storytelling sessions as well as a focus on anger management 189 techniques could be incorporated to produce an effect that captures the benefits of both dialogue and training workshops; 4. Test the effect of repeated interaction between participants through subsequ ent contact in facilitated settings, particularly to determine whether trust increases as a result of repeated exposure to the outgroup; 5. Develop innovative ways to capture societal level effects of the workshops, possibly by tracking participant progress in their home villages following the workshops; 6. Use similar field experimental methodology to assess the impact of other non- contact based interventions on reconciliation such as political and structural changes, truth-telling, etc. The accumulation of data will help confirm the relationship between various interventions and the psychological changes necessary for reconciliation; 7. Finally, a long-term agenda would begin to compare all of the above findings from various conflict-affected contexts to understand the threshold at which enough reconciliation has occurred such that societies no longer relapse into violence. This would ultimately provide practitioners with a guideline for when to initiate and discontinue interventions designed to create the conditions for reconciliation in post-conflict societies. In addition, I would like to highlight several implications of this study for practitioners seeking to replicate or adapt this research in various conflict -affected contexts: 1. Field experiments: While in theory, field experiments present a rigorous methodology for exploring causal claims, the reality of working in conflict- 190 affected settings often poses unanticipated challenges that introduce bia s into the most well-planned study design, which in turn jeopardizes the precision of the results. As such, while field experimentation should be an important tool for making empirical gains regarding the causal effects of peacebuilding interventions, the challenges associated with this methodology should be well understood by those both designing future experimental studies, as well as those seeking to interpret their results. As such, it is important to note that the key challenge in field experimentation i s ensuring the random allocation of subjects to treatment. Insofar as possible, i t is essential to control assignment to treatment, such that treated and untreated unit s are identical except that one group receives the treatment while the other does not. This has several implications for practitioners: Allocate sufficient time and money to the process of selecting partic ipants and assigning them to treatment groups. Problems such as those described in Chapter 3 in which participants are misidentified, drop out of the study, and/or participate but their data cannot be used introduce bias into the study and should be avoided wherever possible. \"Randomization\" in the context of field experiments has a different meaning than its colloquial usage. To ensure proper statistical randomization, ideally you would complete the participant selection, send all data to a statistician a nd have them randomly assign individuals to treatment. This \"double-blind design\" avoids introducing bias that may be present if the researcher assign s individuals to treatment or control based on known characteristics of participants. It also ensures that the participants will be properly assigned t o 191 treatment or control based on sound statistical logic. If you do not have access to a statistician, use a statistics package to generate a random number for each subject, then sort all subjects in ascending order. Finally assign them rand omly to treatment and control groups. This allows your work to be replicated by other researchers and is perhaps the most important methodological step in a field experiment. The method of data collection for the treatment and control groups should be identical. In this study, lack of financial resources lead me to choose to collec t data from workshop participants in the workshop venue before and after the workshops, while data collection for control group members was done in their villages. Additionally, different enumerators were used to collect data in th e workshops versus in the field to avoid additional transportation costs. Ideally, future experiments would allocate sufficient funds to implement a uniform method of data collection for all study participants. This implies that the same enumerators would collect data in the same manner for all participants. Additionally, it would be ideal to collect participant data several weeks after the trainings rather than immediately following the workshops to capture whether the effects of the workshops remain or whether a sense of euphoria was driving the post-workshop results. Finally, navigating the political and security environment will be an unavoidable challenge for all intergroup contact programs and time should be built into program timelines and budgets to manage unanticipated obstacles. Where possible, securing high level political support for the project can be helpful, though relying on this support for program implementation may prove fatal if the political mood changes. As such, securing political buy-in may b e 192 helpful, but weigh carefully the risks associated with partnering with high- level political or government agencies. 2. Participant Selection: In this study, we aimed to select participants who were either members of, or sympathizers with, GAM or PETA, and scored 15 or higher on the measure of affective prejudice included in Survey 1 (Appendix A). However, in future experiments, it may be more effective to use the measure of affective empa thy on the first survey and select study participants who have low initial levels of empathy for the outgroup, rather than selecting those who have high levels of prejudice. The reason for this is that we found initial levels of empathy to be correlated with less intergroup contact, more prejudice, less trust and less forgiveness, so highly prejudiced people would still be selected by using the empathy scale instead of the prejudice scale. In addition, improvement in affective empathy was associated with those who entered the workshops with low levels of empathy, and this improvement was positively correlated with improvement in all forms of prejudice (affecti ve, cognitive and behavioral), as well as in all forms of healing (PTSD, depression and anxiety). Therefore, using the empathy scale to select participants would focus selection on people who will benefit most from the workshops and target highly prejudiced individuals with low empathy, less trust, less forgiveness and fewer contact experiences with members of the outgroup. 3. Workshop Design In future experiments, I recommend testing a single hybrid workshop meth od 193 that enhances the dialogue methodology used in this study to incorporate a) more therapeutic methodology that aims to better prepare participants for storytelling and help them resolve outstanding emotions; and b) elements of the training workshops such as anger management techniques that may be responsible for reducing symptoms of PTSD. This may require either lengthening the workshops or, ideally holding repeated workshops with the same participants. In theory, this hybrid model would be expected to produce a reduction of prejudice, as well as an increase in forgiveness, trust and healing . Finally, as research continues to weaken the link between reconciliation and the transitional justice mechanisms of truth-telling, it is important for peace building practitioners to consider other means of achieving reconciliation. 236 While the results of this study are modest, they provide the first empirical evidence that intergr oup contact programs may offer an effective complement for encouraging re conciliation in conflict-affected societies. However, as more questions than answers r emain, it is essential that scholars and practitioners develop a robust research agenda tha t seeks to advance both the theory and practice of reconciliation. 236 Mendeloff, \"Trauma and vengeance: Assessing the ps ychological and emotional effects of post- conflict justice.\"; O'Connell, \"Gambling with the p syche: Does prosecuting human rights violators console their victims?.\"; Thoms, Ron, and Paris, \"T he effects of transitional justice mechanisms: A summary of empirical research findings and implicat ions for analysts and practitioners.\"; Broun\u00e9us, \"The trauma of truth telling: Effects of witnessing in the Rwandan gacaca courts on psychological health.\" 194 APPENDIX A : QUESTIONNAIRE FOR FIRST INTERVIEW I.

CONSENT TO PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH STUDY You are being asked to take part in a research project that will evaluate the confli ct resolution program being implemented by . The evaluation is being supported by Rachel Schiller, a PhD student from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, USA and will ensure that the information needed to evaluate the success of the program is obtained. PURPOSE: The purpose of this research project is to learn more about how contact between groups in a post-conflict society effects intergroup relations. As a pa rticipant in the program, you are in a position to provide us with valuable insight about your experience throughout the process. We would therefore appreciate if you would be willing to complete a questionnaire about your experience three times throughout the program\u2014once today, once at the beginning of the program, and once after the final session of the program. You may also be asked to participate in an interview following the conclusion of the program. PROCEDURES: We expect that each interview will take approximately 1-2 hours and will be conducted by a staff member from X. Each person who participates in this study is extremely important to the outcome of the study. Two thirds of the people who fill out the first questionnaire will be invited to come to Banda Aceh to participate in some training sessions. One third will participate in the study by filling out questionnaires. The selection of who will come to the training will be made completely randomly by Ms. Rachel Schiller. Your answers on the questionnaire do not influence the likelihood that you will be selected to attend the trainings. We w ould therefore appreciate if you can answer the questions as honestly as possible . Confidentiality is very important to us. Your name will not appear on the questionnaire and the questionnaires will be placed in a sealed envelope at the end of the interview. Your responses will only be known by X staff. The first questionnaire will be administered today in your village. You will r eceive 50,000 Rupiah for filling out the questionnaire. Approximately two weeks after completing the first survey, you will be contacted by a X staff member who w ill inform you whether you have been selected in the random process to attend a three day training session in Banda Aceh. If you are selected to attend a training i n Banda Aceh, the staff member will provide you with dates and travel information. Your transportation, hotel and food costs will be covered by the program. A total of six trainings are expected to take place between April 1 and April 30, 2011. During the interview, if you are tired or need a break, please take as much time as you need to rest so that you are able to give your full attention to answering the ques tions on the questionnaire. If you do not understand the questions, please ask the X staff member to clarify the questions. Finally, with your permission we would like to take photographs. The photographs will be used in program reports and to present our research at various conferences in order that others can learn from this experience. 196 CONFIDENTIALITY AND RISK: There is some risk of discomfort when discussing topics that could bring to mind distressing or emotional memories. Pleas e know though that you do not have to answer any questions or discuss any topics that make you feel uncomfortable. Should you require assistance as a result of any dis tress occurring during the program or wish to discuss your feelings or experience s with a professional, the facilitators will be able to provide you with references f or qualified mental health professionals in Aceh. Additionally, there is also risk involved if you divulge information regarding human rights abuses within the program setting as this information may not be safeguarde d by other study participants and may become public information. Program facilit ators will try to minimize this risk by requesting information shared in the sessi ons to remain confidential, but you should be aware that the facilitators may be unable t o control the actions of participants. WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPATION: Should you decide at any time during the program, questionnaires or interviews that you no longer wish to participate, you may withdraw your consent by informing the facilitators that you no longer w ish to participate without any penalty to you. Your participation throughout the program is however very important and we certainly hope that you will be able to attend all of the sessions. COSTS AND BENEFITS: If you are part of the third of participants who are randomly selected to participate in three questionnaires you will receive R p. 50,000 for each questionnaire that you complete for a total of Rp. 150,000. If you are part of the two thirds of participants who are randomly selected to participate in the trainings in Banda Aceh you will receive Rp. 50,000 for filling out the first questionnaire and the following items will be paid for you: Transport to Banda Aceh from your village by mini bus organized by X. The mini bus will travel at night and you will arrive in Banda Aceh in the morning on the day before your training allowing you a day to rest in Banda Aceh. A cash-payment of a total of 40,000 Rp made to you by X to pay for snacks on the ride to (20,000 Rupiah) and from (20,000 Rupiah) Banda Aceh. Three nights of accommodation in Banda Aceh sharing a room with two other people. Lunch and dinner for the day before the training. Breakfast, lunch and dinner for the three days of the training. Return transportation to your village from Banda Aceh in a mini bus organized by X, which will leave in the afternoon of the third day of training after the completion of the training. While there are no guaranteed benefits for you, your participation will contr ibute to greater awareness about how to foster reconciliation in post-conflict societ ies, and about how to proceed with reconciliation in Aceh. It is hoped that there will be benefits from your participation for others as we ll 197 because this research will be published in academic journals and will be formed into policy recommendations for the government of Aceh and donors supporting the Aceh peace process as well as other peace processes around the world. As such, your opinion and perspective are very valuable. REQUEST FOR MORE INFORMATION: You may ask more questions about the study at any time.
