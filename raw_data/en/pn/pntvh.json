The good news is that your child can heal and grow through these stressful experiences without long-term effects on health. And in the process of helping them do this, you may build a closer relationship with them. Starting the healing process After an extremely stressful experience, children may feel that they are \"broken.\" They may feel that something is wrong with them, or that they are just \"bad.\"' It can be helpful to remind your child: They did nothing to deserve what happened to them. They are having normal reactions to an abnormal experience. The experience may have hurt them, but healing is possible. Healing tools & strategies for you and your child Supportive relationships Safe, supportive, nurturing relationships can make all the difference for a child who is struggling through something stressful. Try these relationship-building activities with your child: Quality sleep Worries may keep us awake, cause nightmares or restless sleep, and younger kids may start [wetting the bed](/English/ages-stages/toddler/toilet-training/Pages/Regression.aspx) again. When children are stressed, they may need more flexible bedtime routines and more help falling asleep, such as: Comforting items and relaxing routines For children experiencing separation anxiety at night (common after stressful or traumatic events), consider providing reassurance that you are still present and give concrete reminders such as: Love notes stuck around the bedside Pieces of clothing that smell like you For some children, consider staying in their room while they fall asleep or even letting them sleep with you for a short period of time as they process the stressful experience. Use light to your advantage During the day, especially early on, get direct exposure to natural sunlight. This helps regulate sleep, mood and immune function, among other systems. At night, reduce exposure to screens and artificial lights by dimming them. You can even consider [blue light-blocking glasses ](/English/health-issues/conditions/eyes/Pages/What-Too-Much-Screen-Time-Does-to-Your-Childs-Eyes.aspx)to limit exposure to the blue wavelengths of light that especially wake the brain up. Balanced, anti-inflammatory nutrition Stress can increase inflammation in the body. Stress can also lead us to over- or under-eat or crave foods high in fat, salt and/or sugar. Knowing this can help us be kind to ourselves and our kids when they reach for the brownie and the potato chips\u2014and how we might help. Make it easier to eat healthy foods like nuts, avocados, cheese and fruits. Increase the availability of vegetables (fresh or frozen!) at [snacks](/English/ages-stages/toddler/nutrition/Pages/Selecting-Snacks-for-Toddlers.aspx) and meals. Skip the juice and soda and [drink water](/English/healthy-living/nutrition/Pages/Choose-Water-for-Healthy-Hydration.aspx) instead. Reduce foods that increase inflammation such as processed food and white (simple) carbohydrates. Physical activity Exercise can be a powerful way of releasing extra stress energy and counteracting the stress response. Consider: Getting outside and enjoying nature Time in the [outdoors](/English/family-life/power-of-play/Pages/playing-outside-why-its-important-for-kids.aspx) can be calming, build resilience and be a source of exercise. Mindfulness Mindfulness practices can help calm the stress response, improve self-regulation skills and increase self-compassion and empathy: Sensory support Soothing, rhythmic sensory activities can help reset the way stress is stored in our nervous system and body. Consider: Massage Music Movement (dancing, walking, jumping, swinging, rocking, [swimming](/English/safety-prevention/at-play/Pages/Swim-Lessons.aspx)) Occupational or physical therapy Self-regulation and other coping skills Your child will be better able to deal with stress as they learn to manage their feelings and behavior. Build in extra structure and routines. This may include developing transition plans for going from one activity to the next, for example. Talk about and model how to [name and manage strong emotions](/English/family-life/family-dynamics/communication-discipline/Pages/Components-of-Good-Communication.aspx), and when to seek help or take time away from a situation. Finding purpose and meaning This can help when we wonder \"Why did this happen?\" \"Why me?\" \"Why did I survive and my friend or relative didn't?\" Even young children can benefit from these activities. Consider: A spiritual practice or connecting to a religious community Helping others through service or volunteer work Finding a calling or purpose, including helping fix systemic injustices Becoming a peer supporter Cognitive and emotional support Trauma and stress can impact how we think and relate to others. Some children may need extra support through: Working on your own stress responses & modeling healing strategies We know that a stressful time for your child is a stressful time for you, too.
