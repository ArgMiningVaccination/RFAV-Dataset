Why? Because suddenly, almost overnight, many people had more time for it. Some meditated, baked, exercised, took bubble baths, spent time with loved ones in socially distanced circles, and slowed the pace of life. Hopefully, any reframing that healthier habits brought in 2020-2022 hasn't disintegrated. But if it has and you've once again stepped into the overwhelm of a packed schedule, the [ayurvedic practice](https://www.everydayhealth.com/integrative-health/ayurveda/guide/) of abhyanga may help you reconnect with yourself \u2014 and improve your overall wellness in the process. Here's a look at what abhyanga is, the potential benefits, how to practice it, and more. Definition of Abhyanga Abhyanga is a type of massage performed with oil, often warmed between the palms before application, that you practice on yourself or receive as a therapy. It's derived from the Sanskrit words anga (movement) and abhi (different, against, or contrary), according to a [review in the July 2017 Journal of Ayurveda and Integrated Medical Sciences](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318312556_Abhyanga_Different_contemporary_massage_technique_and_its_importance_in_Ayurveda). The [California College of Ayurveda](https://www.ayurvedacollege.com/blog/ahbyanga-ayurvedic-massage-and-the-practice-self-love/) notes that abhyanga is also called snehana, which means \"to nurture or love.\" This seems fitting, because that's exactly what you're doing when you take the time to mindfully, slowly massage warm oil into your skin. \"Abhyanga is something that [may help] us overcome daily mental and physical wear-and-tear,\" says [Salila Sukumaran](https://www.ayurgamaya.com/about-salila/), an ayurvedic educator in Los Altos, California. \"Where I come from, in the South of India, abhyanga is performed every day [by many people],\" she says. Common Questions & Answers History of Abhyanga Abhyanga is a practice in [ayurvedic medicine](/integrative-health/ayurveda/guide/) from India, one of the oldest medical systems in the world, according to the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/ayurvedic-medicine-in-depth). This traditional medical system approaches health in a holistic way, such as through a [seasonal ayurvedic diet](https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/potential-health-benefits-of-an-ayurvedic-diet/), yoga and meditation practices, herbal remedies, [oil pulling](https://www.everydayhealth.com/integrative-health/oil-pulling/guide/), and [dry brushing](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/dry-brushing/guide/). Traditionally, abhyanga is one of the dinacharya, or daily practices, for maintaining health, or as part of the pretreatment procedure of panchakarma (a more intensive \"detox\" treatment regimen), per the aforementioned published review. How Abhyanga Works In ayurveda, abhyanga may work in several ways. \"Skin is one of the biggest organs in the body. It plays a role in elimination and immunity,\" says Sukumaran. Both the oil and massage [may improve health](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/potential-health-benefits-of-massage-therapy/) in different ways. [Massage](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/massage-therapy/guide/) itself can be de-stressing, and the oil may act as a moisturizer for the skin to keep it supple and hydrated. Properly hydrated skin allows the skin's barrier to stay intact, which is important because the skin is your immune system's first line of defense, notes a [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31709535/) on skin, immunity, and aging. According to [Banyan Botanicals](https://www.banyanbotanicals.com/info/ayurvedic-living/living-ayurveda/lifestyle/self-oil-massage/), ayurveda practitioners believe that oil self-massage may also lead to: - Better circulation (of blood and lymph fluid) - Improvement in sleep - Healthy vision - Increased longevity The practice encourages you to put yourself first by carving out time and ritualizing [self-care](/self-care/); in theory, this has a positive ripple effect on your wellness. \"Abhyanga is one of the most important self-care rituals. When we care for our most precious thing \u2014 our bodies \u2014 it leads to higher self-esteem and self-respect,\" says Sukumaran, from her personal experience. Possible Health Benefits of Abhyanga Note that more research is still needed to better understand the possible perks of abhyanga. To date, most Western, aka conventional, research examines the general health benefits of ayurveda and its applications for specific populations, and research on abhyanga, specifically, is lacking. If you're looking to incorporate a low-risk, self-care practice (or traditional form of [massage therapy](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/potential-health-benefits-of-massage-therapy/)) into your new routine, here are some potential benefits of abhyanga. May Help Relieve Stress Anyone who's visited a spa for a massage or asked a partner or friend for a simple shoulder rub knows just how stress-relieving a massage might be. \"Abhyanga helps soothe and calm the nervous system,\" says Katie Silcox, an ayurvedic teacher and author of [Glow Worthy](https://theshaktischool.com/glow-worthy-book/), based in Charlottesville, Virginia. She refers back to the state of being a baby, where most people receive lots of skin-to-skin contact \u2014 something that happens rarely outside of intimacy today. As you practice self-massage, \"you're taking yourself back to that time, reminding yourself through your physiology that you are loved, safe, and valued for who you are. This is a deep spiritual ritual you can do for yourself,\" she explains, from her personal experience. [Some research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21568717/) corroborates this potential benefit, showing that healthy people who received abhyanga massage from a therapist for an hour reported lower perceived [stress levels](/stress/guide/causes/). It's important to note, however, that studies on the self-massage form of abhyanga are lacking. May Improve Circulation The touch in massage stimulates your circulation, and conventional massage therapy has been shown to lower blood pressure levels, according to an [earlier study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3733180/). That research looked at 10-15 minutes of Swedish massage (a different massage technique) and found that these blood pressure benefits persisted for at least three days after the massage. Though there is no research yet on abhyanga specifically for improved circulation, this may be a possible benefit scientists will explore someday. This [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6148064/) on abhyanga massage therapy did find participants had a reduction in heart rate and blood pressure, yet given the sample size, more research is needed. May Promote Better Sleep Massage therapy, in general, has been shown to improve sleep, including for [people with insomnia](/insomnia/why-cant-sleep-insomnia-both-acute-chronic-explained/) or those who have pain conditions, according to the [American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA)](https://www.amtamassage.org/about/position-statements/massage-therapy-can-help-improve-sleep/). For many people, a popular time to practice abhyanga is before bedtime. Having soothing pre-bed rituals free of technology and other [stressors](/stress/guide/) and distractions may help your body wind down in preparation for sleep. \"[Some] people report that abhyanga before bed helps their sleep,\" says Silcox, of her teaching experience. As you'll learn below, abhyanga can be done in just 15 minutes, but busy people may benefit from performing a light massage in the shower for just a minute or two, she adds. May Aid Skin and Hair Health During abhyanga, you'll likely massage both your skin and scalp, which means you may apply the oil to your hair as well. One [review](https://jaims.in/jaims/article/view/963/982) noted that the oil may nourish your skin to make it soft, elastic, and strong. Likewise, regular [applications of oil to your scalp](https://www.everydayhealth.com/skin-beauty/plant-based-oils-that-may-give-you-healthier-hair/) may boost the health of the skin here, as well as the hair follicles, improving scalp dryness, itching, and even [dandruff](/dandruff/guide/). The act of massaging this oil onto skin is believed to dilate small blood vessels to increase circulation, which may deliver nutrients to skin and hair follicles, per [past research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15730338/). Finally, rubbing your hands on your skin exfoliates it by removing dead skin cells, which is another reason why your body may feel softer when you're done. Abhyanga Safety and Side Effects The good news? A self-massage practice is usually safe. \"Abhyanga is something that does really help almost everyone,\" says Silcox, in her experience. [Research suggests](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344745102_AYURVEDA_ABHYANGA_MASSAGE_PROCEDURE_-_A_REVIEW/link/5f8d5b40a6fdccfd7b6c0cb7/download) there are certain health conditions that may make abhyanga inappropriate for certain groups. Those can include [people with osteoporosis](/osteoporosis/guide/), skin disease, fractures, varicose veins, [atherosclerosis](/atherosclerosis/guide/), cancer, and an open wound, among others. Talk to your doctor first to determine if abhyanga oil massage on yourself or as a therapy is right for you. Who Might Want to Try (and Avoid) Abhyanga Tips for Getting Started With Abhyanga Consult an Ayurvedic Practitioner Ideally, before you start a new ayurvedic practice, especially if you're planning to use it longer term, you'll seek guidance from an ayurvedic practitioner. Ayurvedic medicine is not regulated in the United States by the federal government, and no state has a licensure requirement, but the [National Ayurvedic Medical Association](https://www.ayurvedanama.org/) offers a [tool](https://ayurveda.memberclicks.net/find-a-professional-directory#/) to locate a certified professional near you, who can help you identify your individual constitution to formulate an ayurvedic wellness routine, including establishing an abhyanga practice that's designed for your specific needs. If you desire to explore abhyanga on your own, here is some introductory information for the self-massage form of this practice, from our discussions with Silcox and Sukumaran. Identify Your Dosha, or Constitution In ayurveda, your constitution is the balance of the three doshas in your body, according to the [California College of Ayurveda](https://www.ayurvedacollege.com/blog/ayurveda_your_constitution/). A dosha is believed to be an energy that makes up your unique mind and body, based on air, fire, water, earth, and space elements. According to ayurveda, the three doshas are pitta (fire), vata (air and space), and kapha (earth and water). Consulting an ayurvedic practitioner can help you identify which ayurvedic practices and applications work best for you and your constitution. Silcox, who is also the founder of the Shakti School, provides a [free dosha quiz](https://theshaktischool.com/product/what-is-your-dosha/) if you want to learn more about your dosha (or doshas, as some people have dominant combinations of two or all three). Other quizzes can be found elsewhere online, too, to help you learn more about your doshic constitution or to learn more before you see a formal practitioner. For example, the [Kripalu Center for Yoga and Health](https://kripalu.org/content/whats-your-dosha) and the [Chopra Center](https://chopra.com/dosha-quiz) both offer similar free tools. Choose Your Oil The oil component of abhyanga is believed to be especially important. \"[Most] organic food-grade oils will work great,\" says Sukumaran. In particular, sesame oil is generally considered one of the better oils for the body, she says, especially if you have drier skin or live in an arid climate. [Coconut oil](/diet-nutrition/diet/coconut-oil-health-benefits-nutrition-facts-uses-more/) can be another option, especially during times of heat, as it's a cooling oil, per ayurvedic philosophy. You can use coconut oil in the summer, for example, or if you have a \"fire\" constitution, also known as a pitta dosha. Kapha dosha types may be prone to oily skin, notes Sukumaran, and in this case a lighter oil like almond or jojoba, or dry brushing, may be better. The oil is also often paired with spices in an effort to balance your dosha. You can create your own by steeping oil along with food-grade spices, such as cinnamon, clove, cardamom, or bay leaf, says Sukumaran. Seek guidance from an ayurvedic practitioner about which spices or herbal preparations will balance your dosha. A simpler route, says Silcox, is to purchase a ready-to-use herbal massage oil designed for your dosha. Companies like Banyan Botanicals sell formulations for vata, pitta, and kapha. Begin by Massaging the Limbs Warm up the oil with your own body temperature by rubbing it in between your hands. Do not heat up the oil on the stove or with any electric device, to avoid the risk of burning the skin. To get started with the massage, Sukumaran suggests beginning with your limbs. For example, take your left hand and sweep your hand from your shoulder on your right arm down to your wrist. (The idea is to start closer to the heart and move away from the heart.) Repeat on your left arm and then on your legs. Employ just enough pressure to massage the oil into your body, similar to the way you'd moisturize with lotion. Use Circular Strokes on Tender Spots As you approach a joint, like knees or elbows, move your hand in a soft circular motion around the joint. Apply a gentle rounded motion to your belly, butt, and breasts or chest as well. Don't forget the top of your head, feet, inside of your navel, and inside your ears. \"All of these parts of the body are connected to vital organs [according to ayurvedic philosophy]. Applying oil here [may bring] calm, rest, and peace,\" Sukumaran says. Wipe Down and Rinse Off Let the oil sit on your body for at least five minutes. \"Traditionally, next you would walk into a pond or shower to wash yourself off,\" says Sukumaran. Instead you can wipe yourself off with a towel and then rinse yourself in lukewarm water. Since oil will be in your hair, you may shampoo your hair as well. This entire process can be completed in under 15 minutes, Sukumaran says. What to Expect Before, During, and After Abhyanga Here's what you may experience in the time it takes to perform an abhyanga self-massage. Before If you're practicing abhyanga at the end of the day, you may approach it feeling stressed or frazzled, depending on how busy you were. If you incorporate it into your morning routine, you may feel sleepy and more relaxed. Either way, if abhyanga becomes part of your regular routine, you may find that you start to [de-stress](/stress/guide/relief/) in anticipation of this me-time. During As you massage your limbs, your touch may increase your circulation and help stimulate your lymph fluid throughout your body, says Silcox. [One study](https://www.jpsionline.com/articles/a-critical-review-of-abhyanga-with-special-reference-to-its-contemporary-relevance.pdf) noted this effect. (Lymph fluid is the clear fluid that travels through your body carrying cells that fight infection, according to the [National Cancer Institute](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/lymphatic-fluid).) You may also start to feel a general ease or relaxation as your massage progresses. After The oil used in abhyanga will likely leave your skin moisturized, soft, and supple. Some people may notice that the oil completely absorbs into their skin \u2014 a possible sign that their skin was parched and in need of nourishment, Silcox says. Beyond how your skin feels, it's believed that there's an overall benefit to this ritualistic practice for many people in need of dedicated time to destress. \"The oiling, massaging, and washing has a transformative effect [for some]. You may find that you start to face life feeling less overwhelmed and with a better attitude and less anxiety,\" adds Sukumaran. While abhyanga can't do it all \u2014 it's not an antidote to a diagnosed mental health condition or meant to be a replacement for conventional medical care \u2014 you may find that it helps you feel better overall. \"All of these self-care techniques \u2014 especially self-massage \u2014 are in service of knowing your lovability,\" says Silcox. \"If you add this to your to-do list, it will defeat the purpose. Instead, you can make it a body prayer, or a spiritual practice,\" she says, of her own practice and experience. What Does Abhyanga Cost? The good news is that abhyanga is (mostly) free, as a self-administered practice. In the self-massage form, your own hands do all the work \u2014 the challenge can be finding the time if you're in an especially busy season of life. There will be minimal cost associated with the self-care practice, as you'll need to purchase the oil. Note that if you're receiving abhyanga massage from a practitioner, that would of course require payment, similar to a massage therapist. Separately, consulting an ayurvedic practitioner about how to get started with abhyanga (or any other ayurvedic practice) may range depending upon the practitioner, area of the country, and the provider's skill level, among other factors. If you simply need guidance on your constitution, recommendations for which oil to start with, and a tutorial on how to perform abhyanga, you can talk to your practitioner about fees and ask if they have a sliding fee scale before you book your appointment. Ayurvedic medicine is not typically covered by insurance.
