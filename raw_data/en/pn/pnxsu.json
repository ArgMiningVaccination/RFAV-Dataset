In the ofce, the physician looks you over,listens to your symptoms, and prescribesa drug. But rst, the doctor takes a lookatyour DNA.That's right, your DNA. Researchers predict that the medicines of the future may not only look and work differently than those you take today, buttomorrow's medicines will be tailored to your genes. In 10 to 20 years, many scientists expect that genetics \u2014the study of how genes influence actions, appearance, and health \u2014will pervade medical treatment. T oday, doctors usually give youan \"average\" dose of a medicine based on yourbody size and age. In contrast, future medicinesmay match the chemical needs of your body, asinfluenced by your genes. Knowing your uniquegenetic make-up could help your doctor prescribe the r ight medicine in the r ight amount, to boost its effectiveness and minimize possible side effects. Along with these so-cal led pharmacogenetic approa ches, many other research directions will help guide the prescribing of medicines. The science of pharmacology \u2014understanding the basics of how our bodies react to medicines andhow medicines affect our bodies \u2014is already a vital part of 21st-century research. Chapter 1, \" ABCs of Pharmacology, \" tracks a medicine's jour ney through the body and describes different avenues of pharmacology research today.Foreword: A Visit to the Doctor delivery, discussed in Chapter 4, \"Molecules to M edicines, \" is advancing progress by helping get dr ugs to diseased sites and away from healthy cells. Medicines By Design aims to explain how scientists unravel the many different ways medicines work in the body and how this information guidesthe hunt for drugs of the future. Pharmacology is a broad discipline encompassing every aspect of the study of drugs, including their discovery and development and the testing of their action in the body. Much of the most promisingpharmacological research going on at universitiesacross the c ountr y is sponsored by the National Institut e of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), a compone nt of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), U.S. De partment of Health and Human Serv ices. Working at the crossroads of chemistry, genetics, cell biology, physiology, and engineering, pharmacologists are ghting disease in the laboratoryand at the bedside.Stay tuned for changes in the way you take medicines and in how medicines are discovered and produced. In Chapter 2, \"Body, Heal Thyself, \" learn how new knowledge about the body's own mole cular machinery is pointing to new drugs. As scientists understand precisely how cells interact inthe body, they can tailor medicines to patch gaps in cell communication pathways or halt signaling circuits that are stuck \"on,\" as in cancer. Scientists are developing methods to have animals and plants manufacture custom-mademedicines and vaccines. Experimental chickens are laying me dicine-c ontaining eggs. Researchers are engineer ing tobacco plants to produce new cance r treatments. T opics in Chapte r 3,\"D rugs From N atur e, Then and Now, \" will bring you up to speed on ho w scientists are looking to nature for a treasure trove of information and resources to manufacture drugs. Advances in understanding the roots of disease are leading to new ways to package tomorrow'smedicines. Along with biology and chemistry, theengineering and computer sciences are leading usto novel ways of getting drugs where they needto go in the body. Cutting-edge research in drugMedicines By Design IForeword 3ABCs of PharmacologyCHAPTER 1 Did you know that, in some people, a single glass of grapefruit juice can alter levels of drugs used to treat allergies, heart disease, and infections?Fifteen years ago, pharmacologists discovered this \"grapefruit juice effect\" by luck, after giving volunteers grapefruit juice to mask the taste of amedicine. Nearly a decade later, researchers g- ured out that grapefruit juice affectsmedicines by lowering levels of adrug-metabolizing enzyme, calledCYP3A4, in the intestines. More recently, Paul B. Watkins of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill discovered that other juices like Seville(sour) orange juice \u2014but not regular orangejuice \u2014have the same effect on the body's handling of medicines. Each of 10 people who volunteeredfor Watkins' juice-medicine study took a standarddose of Plendil \u00ae(a drug used to treat high blood pressure) diluted in grapefruit juice, sour orangejuice, or plain orange juice. The researchers meas- ured blood levels of Plendil at various timesafterward. The team observed that both grapefruitjuice and sour orange juice increased blood levels of Plendil, as if the people had received a higherdose. Regular orange juice had no effect. Watkinsand his coworkers have found that a chemical com - mon to grapefruit and sour oranges,dihydroxybergamottin, is likely the molecular cul-prit. Another similar molecule in these fruits, now why some people's stomachs burn after they swallow an aspirin tablet? Or why a swig of grapefruit juice with breakfast can raise blood levels of some medicines in certain people? Understanding some of the basics of the science of pharmacology will help answer these questions, and many more, about your body and the medicines you take. So, then, what's pharmacology? Despite the eld's long, rich history and impor- tance to human health, few people know muchabout this biomedical science. One pharmacologistjoked that w hen she was ask ed what she did for a living,her reply prompted an unexpected question: \"Isn't ' farm ecology' the study of how livestock impac t the env ironment?\" Ofcourse, this booklet isn't about livestock or agricult ure. Rather, it's about a eld of science that studies how the body reacts to medicines and howmedicines affect the body. Pharmacology is oftenconfused with pharmacy, a separate discipline in the health sciences that deals with preparing anddispensing medicines. For thousands of years, people have looked in nature to nd chemicals to treat their symptoms. Ancient healers had little understanding of how various elixirs worked their magic, but we know much more today. Some pharmacologists studyhow our bodies work, while others study thechemical properties of medicines. Others investi-gate the physical and behavioral effects medicineshave on the b ody. Pharmacology researchers study drug s used to treat diseases, as well as drugs of abuse. Since medicines work in so many different ways in so many different organs of the body, pharma cology research touches just about every area ofbiomedicine.K A Juicy StoryA Drug's Life How does aspirin zap a headache? What happens after you rub some cortisone cream on a patch ofpoison ivy-induced rash on your arm? How dodecongestant medicines such as Sudafed \u00aedry up your nasal passages when you have a cold? Asmedicines nd their way to their \"job sites\" in thebody, hundreds of things happen along the way.One action triggers another, and medicines work to either mask a symptom, like a stuffy nose, or x a problem, like a bacterial infection.Medicines By Design IABCs of Pharmacology 5 Turning a molecule into a good medicine is neither easy nor cheap. The Center for the Study of DrugDevelopment at Tufts University in Boston esti-mates that it takes over $800 million and a dozenyears to sift a few promising drugs from about5,000 failures. Of this small handful of candidatedrugs, only one will survive the rigors of clinicaltesting and end up on pharmacy shelves. That's a huge investment for what may seem a very small gain and, in part, it explains the highcost of many prescription drugs. Sometimes, prob-lems do not show up until after a drug reachesthe market and many people begin taking the drugroutinely. These problems range from irritating sideeffects, such as a dry mouth or drowsiness, to life-threatening problems like serious bleeding or bloodclots. The outlook might be brighter if pharmaceuticalscientists could do a better job of predicting howpotential drugs will act in the body (a science calledpharmacodynamics), as well as what side effects thedrugs might cause. One approach that can help is computer mod - eling of a drug's properties. Computer modeling can help scientists at pharmaceutical and biotech-nology companies lter out, and abandon earlyon, any candidate drugs that are likely to behavebadly in the body. This can save signicantamounts of time and money. Computer software can examine the atom-by- atom structure of a molecule and determinehow durable the chemical is likely to be insidea body's various chemical neighborhoods. Willthe molecule break down easily? How well willthe small intestines take it in? Does it dissolveeasily in the watery environment of the fl uids that course through the human body? Will thedrug be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier?Computer tools not only drive up the successrate for nding candidate drugs, they can alsolead to the development of better medicineswith fewer safety concerns. Many scientists are drawn to pharmacology because of its direct application to the practice of medicine. Pharmacologists study the actions of drugs in the intestinal tract, the brain, the muscles,and the liver \u2014just a few of the most common areas where drugs travel during their stay in the body. Of course, all of our organs are constructed from cells, and inside all of our cells are genes.Many pharmacologists study how medicines interact with cell parts and genes, which in turninfluences how cells behave. Because pharmacologytouches on such diverse areas, pharmacologistsmust be broadly trained in biology, chemistry, andmore applied areas of medicine, such as anatomyand physiology. A Mo del for SuccessNational Institute of General Medical Sciences 6 /c6092A drug's life in the body. Medicines taken by mouth(oral) pass through the liverbefore they are absorbedinto the bloodstream. Otherforms of drug administrationbypass liver, entering directly.Inhaled Stomach IntestinesHeartLung LiverMedicines By Design IABCs of Pharmacology 7 Scientists ha ve names f or the four basic stag es ofa me dicine 's life in the b ody: absorption, distri- bution, metabolism, and excretion. The entire process is sometimes abbreviated ADME. The rst stage is absorption . Medicines can enter the body in many different ways, and they are absorbedwhen they travel from the site of administrationinto the body's circulation. A few of the mostcommon ways to administer drugs are oral (swal-lowing an aspirin tablet), intramuscular (getting aflu shot in an arm muscle), subcutaneous (injectinginsulin just under the skin), intravenous (receiving chemotherapy through a vein), or transdermal (wearing a skin patch). A drug faces its biggest hurdles during absorption. Medicines taken by mouth are shuttled via a special blood vessel leading from the digestive tract to the liver, where a large amount may be d estroye d by metabolic enzymes in the so-cal led \"r st-pass effect.\" Other routes of drug administration bypass the liver, entering the bloodstream directly or via the skin or lungs. Once a drug gets absorbed, the next stage is distribution . Most often, the bloodstream carries medicines throughout the body. During this step,side effects can occur when a drug has an effect inan organ other than the target organ. For a painreliever, the target organ might be a sore musclein the leg; irritation of the stomach could be aside effect. Many factors influence distribution, such as the presence of protein and fat molecules in the blood that can put drug molecules out of commission by grabbing onto them.Transdermal SkinIntramuscular Subcutaneous /c6090Drugs enter different layers of skin via intramuscular,subcutaneous, or transdermaldelivery methods.How you respond to a drug may be quite different from how your neighbor does. Why is that? Despitethe fact that you might be about the same age andsize, you probably eat different foods, get differentamounts of exercise, and have different medicalhistories. But your genes, which are different fromthose of anyone else in the world, are really what make you unique. In part, your genes give you many obvious things, such as your looks, yourmannerisms, and other characteristics that makeyou who you are. Your genes can also affect howyou respond to the medicines you take. Yourgenetic code instructs your body how to makehundreds of thousands of different moleculescalled proteins. Some proteins determine haircolor, and some of them are enzymes that process,or metabolize, food or medicines. Slightly different,but normal, variations in the human genetic codecan yield proteins that work better or worse whenthey are metabolizing many different types ofdrugs and other substances. Scientists use theterm pharmacogenetics to describe research onthe link between genes and drug response. One important group of proteins whose genetic code varies widely among people are \"sulfation\"enzymes, which perform chemical reactions inyour body to make molecules more water-soluble,so they can be quickly excreted in the urine.Sulfation enzymes metabolize many drugs, butthey also work on natural body molecules, such as estrogen. Differences in the genetic code forsulfation enzymes can signicantly alter blood levels of the many different kinds of substances metabolized by these enzymes. The same geneticdifferences may also put some people at riskfor developing certain types of cancers whosegrowth is fueled by hormones like estrogen. Pharmacogeneticist Rebecca Blanchard of Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia has discoveredthat people of different ethnic backgrounds haveslightly different \"spellings\" of the genes that makesulfation enzymes. Lab tests revealed that sulfationenzymes manufactured from genes with differentspellings metabolize drugs and estrogens at differ-ent rates. Blanchard and her coworkers are planningto work with scientists developing new drugs toinclude pharmacogenetic testing in the early phasesof screening new medicines.Drugs destined for the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) face an enormous hurdle: a nearly impenetrable barricade called the blood-brain barrier. This blockade is built from a tightly woven mesh of capillaries cementedtogether to protect the brain from potentiallydangerous substances such as poisons or viruses. Y et pharmacologists have devised various ways to sneak some drugs past this barrier. After a medicine has been distributed through- out the body and has done its job, the drug isbroken down, or metabolized . The breaking down of a drug molecule usually involves two steps that take place mostly in the body's chemical process-ing plant, the liver. The liver is a site of continuous and frenzied ,yet carefully controlled ,activity. Everything that enters the bloodstream \u2014whether swallowed, injected, inhaled, absorbed through the skin, or produced by the body itself \u2014is carried to this largest internal organ. There, substances are chemically pummeled, twisted, cut apart, stucktogether, and transformed.National Institute of General Medical Sciences 8 Medic ines and Your Ge nesThe biotransformations that take place in the liver are performed by the body's busiest proteins, its enzymes. Every one of your cells has a varietyof enzymes, drawn from a repertoire of hundreds of thousands. Each enzyme specializes in a partic-ular job. Some break molecules apart, while otherslink small molecules into long chains. With drugs, the rst step is usually to make the substance easier to get rid of in urine. Many of the products of enzymatic break- down, which are called metabolites, are lesschemically active than the original molecule.For this r eason, scie ntists refer to the liver as a \"deto xifying\" organ. Occasionally, however, drug metabolit es can ha ve chemical activities of their own \u2014somet imes as powerful as those of the original dr ug. When prescribing certain drugs, doctors must take into account these added effects. Once liver enzymes are nished working on amedicine, the now-inactive drug undergoes thenal stage of its time in the body, excretion , as it exits via the urine or feces. Perfect Timing Pharmacokinetics is an aspect of pharmacologythat deals with the absorption, distribution, andexcretion of drugs. Because they are following drugactions in the body, researchers who specialize inpharmacokinetics must also pay attention to anadditional dimension: time. Pharmacokinetics research uses the tools of mathematics. Although sophisticated imagingMedicines By Design IABCs of Pharmacology 9 methods can help trackmedicines as they travel through the body,scientists usually cannot actually see where a drugis going. T o compensate,they often use mathe- matical models and precise measures ofbody fluids, such asblood and urine, to determine where a druggoes and how m uch ofthe drug or a b reak- down product remains afterthe body processes it. Other sentinels, such as blood levels of liver enzymes, can help predict how m uch of a drug is going to be absorbed. Studying pharmacokinetics also uses chem- istry, since the interactions between drug andbody molecules are really just a series of chemicalreactions. Understanding the chemical encountersbetween drugs and biological environments, suchas the bloodstream and the oily surfaces of cells,is necessary to predict how much of a drug willbe taken in by the body. This concept, broadlytermed bioavailability, is a critical feature thatchemists and pharmaceutical scientists keep inmind when designing and packaging medicines.No matter how well a drug works in a laboratorysimulation, the drug is not useful if it can't makeit to its site of action. /c6090Nerve cells use a chemical messenger called acetyl-choline (balls) to tell musclecells to contract. Curare (halfcircles) paralyzes muscles by blocking acetylcholinefrom attaching to its musclecell receptors. Nerve Cell Receptor Muscle Cell Acetylcholine CurareNational Institute of General Medical Sciences of arrows. Bernard discovered that curare causes paralysis by blocking chemical signals between nerve and muscle cells. His ndings demonstratedthat chemicals can carry messages between nerve cells and other types of cells. Since Bernard's experiments with curare, researchers have discovered many nervous system messengers, now called neurotransmitters. These chemical messengers are called agonists, a genericterm pharmacologists use to indicate that a moleculetriggers some sort of response when encountering acell (such as muscle contraction or hormone release).Fitting In While it may seem obvious now, scientists did not always know that drugs have specic moleculartargets in the body. In the mid-1880s, the French physiologist Claude Bernard made a crucialdiscovery that steered researchers toward under-standing this principle. By guring out how a chemical called curare works, Bernard pointed to the nervous system as a new focus for pharma-cology. Curare \u2014a plant extract that paralyzes muscles \u2014had been used for centuries by Native Americans in South America to poison the tips10means there is no effect. Scientists most often plot data from dose-response experiments on agraph. A typical \"dose-response curve\" demon-strates the effects of what happens (the verticalY-axis) when more and more drug is added to the experiment (the horizontal X-axis). One of the rst neurotransmitters identied was acetylcholine, which causes muscle contrac- tion. Curare works by tricking a cell into thinking itis acetylcholine. By tting \u2014not q uite as w ell, but nevertheless tting \u2014into receiving molecules called receptors on a muscle cell, curare prevents acetylcholine from attaching and delivering itsmessage. No acetylcholine means no contraction,and muscles become paralyzed. Most medicines exert their effects by making physical contact with receptors on the surface ofa cell. Think of an agonist-receptor interaction like a key tting into a lock. Inserting a key into a door lock permits the doorknob to be turnedand allows the door to be opened. Agonists opencellular locks (receptors), and this is the rst stepMedicines By Design IABCs of Pharmacology 11 1 10 100Desired EffectSide Effect Drug X-axisEffect on Body Y-axis DoseResponse /c6090 Dose-response curves determine how much ofa drug (X-axis) causesa particular effect, or aside effect, in the body(Y-axis). in a co mmunicatio n between the outside of the cell and the insid e,which contains all the mini- machines that make the cell run. Scientists have identied thousands of receptors. Because receptors have a critical role in controlling the activity of cells, they are common targets for researchers designingnew medicines. Curare is one example of a molecule called an antagonist. Drugs that act as antagonistscompete with natural agonists for receptors but act only as decoys, freezing up the receptor andpreventing agonists' use of it. Researchers oftenwant to block cell responses, such as a rise in blood pressure or an increase in heart rate. Forthat reason, many drugs are antagonists, designedto blunt overactive cellular responses.One of the most important principles of pharma- cology, and of much of research in general, is aconcept called \"dose-response.\" Just as the term implies, this notion refers to the relationship between some effect \u2014let's say, lowering of blood pressure \u2014and the amount of a drug. Scientists care a lot about dose-response databecause these mathematical relationships signifythat a medicine is working according to a specic interaction between different molecules in the body. Sometimes, it takes years to gure out exactly which molecules are working together, but when testing a potential medicine, researchers must rst show that three things are true in an experi-ment. First, if the drug isn't there, you don't get any effect. In our example, that means no changein blood pressure. Second, adding more of thedrug (up to a certain point) causes an incrementalchange in effect (lower blood pressure with moredrug). Third, taking the drug away (or masking its action with a molecule that blocks the drug)The Right DoseThe key to agonists tting snugly into their receptors is shape . Researchers who study how drugs and other chemicals exert their effects in particular organs \u2014the heart, the lungs, the kidneys, and so on \u2014are very interested in the shapes of molecules. Some drugs have very broad effects because they t into receptors on many different kinds of cells. Some side effects, such as dry mouth or a drop in blood pressure, can resultfrom a drug encountering receptors in places otherthan the target site. One of a pharmacologist's12 National Institute of General Medical Sciences of steroids include vitamin D, cholesterol, estrogen, and cortisone \u2014molecules that are critical for keeping the body running smoothly. Varioussteroids have important roles in the body's repro-ductive system and the structure and function ofmembranes. Researchers have also discovered that steroids can be active in the brain, where theyaffect the nervous system. Some steroids maythus nd use as anesthetics, medicines that sedatepeople before surgery by temporarily slowingdown brain function. Douglas Covey of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, has uncovered new roles for several of these neurosteroids, which alterelectrical activity in the brain. Covey's researchshows that neurosteroids can either activate or tone down receptors that communicate themessage of a neurotransmitter called gamma-aminobutyrate, or GABA. The main job of thisneurotransmitter is to dampen electrical activitythroughout the brain. Covey and other scientistshave found that steroids that activate the receptorsfor GABA decrease brain activity even more,making these steroids good candidates for anes-thetic medicines. Covey is also investigating the potential of neuroprotective steroids in preventing the nerv e-wasting effects of certain neurodegenerative disorders. OHCH3CH3 R/c6091A steroid is a molecule with chemicalstructure consisting ofmultiple \"rings\" (hexagonsand pentagon, below).In today's culture, the word \"steroid\" conjures up notions of drugs taken by athletes to boost strengthand physical performance. But steroid is actuallyjust a chemical name for any substance that has a characteristic chemical structure consisting ofmultiple rings of connected atoms. Some examplesSteroids for Surgerymajor goals is to reduce these side effects by developing drugs that attach only to receptors on the target cells. That is much easier said than done. While agonists may t nearly perfectly into a receptor's shape, other molecules may also brush up toreceptors and sometimes set them off. These types of unintended, nonspecic interactions can cause side effects. They can also affect howmuch drug is available in the body.Medicines By Design IABCs of Pharmacology 13 Feverfew for migraines, garlic for heart disease, St. John's wort for depression. These are just a few of the many \"natural\" substances ingested bymillions of Americans to treat a variety of healthconditions. The use of so-called alternative medi-cines is widespread, but you may be surprised tolearn that researchers do not know in most caseshow herbs work \u2014or if they work at all \u2014inside the human body. Herbs are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, and scientists have not performedcareful studies to evaluate their safety and effec-tiveness. Unlike many prescription (or even over-the-counter) medicines, herbs contain many \u2014 sometimes thousands \u2014of ingredients. While somesmall studies haveconrmed the John's wort is of no benet in treatingmajor depression. What's more, because herbs arecomplicated concoctions containing many activecomponents, they can interfere with the body'smetabolism of other drugs, such as certain HIVtreatments and birth control pills.how a person is processing a drug. Usually, this important analysis involves mathematical equa- tions, which take into account many different variables. Some of the variables include the physi- cal and chemical properties of the drug, the totalamount of blood in a person's body, the individ-ual's age and body mass, the health of the person's liver and kidneys, and what other medicines the person is taking. Clinical pharmacologists alsomeasure drug metabolites to gauge how muchdrug is in a person's body. Sometimes, doctorsgive patients a \"loading dose\" (a large amount)rst,followed by smaller doses at later times. This approac h works by getting enough drug into the body before it is metabolized (broken down) into inactive parts, giving the drug the best chance to do its jo b.Bench to Bedside: Clinical Pharmacology Prescribing drugs is a tricky science, requiring physicians to carefully consider many factors. Y our doctor can measure or otherwise determinemany of these factors, such as weight and diet. But another key factor is drug interactions. Y oualready know that every time you go to the doctor, he or she will ask whether you are taking any other drugs and whether you have any drug allergies orunusual reactions to any medicines. Interactions between different drugs in the body, and between drugs and foods or dietarysupplements, can have a signicant influence, sometimes \"fooling\" your body into thinking you have taken more or less of a drug than you actually have taken. By measuring the amounts of a drug in blood or urine, clinical pharmacologists can calculate Nature's Drugs Bacteria have an uncanny ability to defend themselves against antibiotics. In trying to gure out why this is so, scientists have notedthat antibiotic medicines that kill bacteria in a variety of different ways can be thwarted by the bacteria they are designed to destroy.One reason, says Kim Lewis of Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, may bethe bacteria themselves. Microorganisms have ejection systems called multidrug-resistance (MDR) pumps \u2014large proteins that weave through cell-surface membranes. Researchers believe that microbes have MDR pumpsmainly for self-defense. The pumps are used to monitor incoming chemicals and to spit out the ones that might endanger the bacteria.Pump It Up \u00a9 LINDA S. NYENational Institute of General Medical Sciences 14example, are often \"kicked out\" of cancer cells by MDR pumps residing in cells' mem- branes. MDR membranes all overthe the brain, digestive tract, liver, and kidneys \u2014perform important jobs in moving natural body molecules like hormones into and out of cells. Pharmacologist Mary Vore of the University of Kentucky in Lexington hasdiscovered that certain types of MDR pumpsdo not work properly during pregnancy,and she suspects that estrogen and otherpregnancy hormones may be partially respon- sible. Vor e has recently focused efforts on determining if the MDR pump is malformed in pregnant women who have intrahepaticcholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). A relativelyrare condition, ICP often strikes during the third trimester and can cause signicant discomfort such as severe itching and nausea,while also endangering the growing fetus.Vore's research on MDR pump function mayalso lead to improvements in drug therapyfor pregnant women.Lewis suggests that plants, which produce many natural bacteria-killing molecules, have gotten \"smart\" over time, developing ways tooutwit bacteria. He suspects that evolution has driven plants to produce natural chemicals thatblock bacterial MDR pumps, bypassing thisbacterial protection system. Lewis tested his idea by rst genetically knocking out the gene for the MDR pump from the common bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) . He and his coworkers then exposed the altered bacteria to a very weak antibiotic called berberine that hadbeen chemical ly extracted from barberry plants.

Slowly andmethodically, one by one, the pieces t together tomake a pretty picture. Research is a puzzle, but thejigsaw analogy is flawed. The truth is, scientistsdon't have a puzzle box to know what the nished picture is supposed to look like. If you know theresult of an experiment ahead of time, it's not reallyan experiment. Being a scientist is hard work, but most researchers love the freedom to explore their curiosities. They testideas methodically, nding answers to new problems,and every day brings a new challenge. But researchersmust keep their eyes and ears open for surprises. Onoccasion, luck wins out and breakthroughs happen\"by accident.\" The discovery of vaccines, X rays, andpenicillin each came about when a scientist was willingto say, \"Hmmm, I wonder why...\" and followed up onan unexpected nding.cientists became interested in the workings of the human body during the \"scientic revolution\" of the 15th and 16th centuries. These early studies led to descriptions of the circulatory, digestive, respiratory, nervous, and excretory systems. In time, scientists came to think of thebody as a kind of machine that uses a series of chemical reactions to convert food into energy.The Body Machine Scientists still think about the body as a well-oiledmachine, or set of machines, powered by a controlsystem called metabolism. The conversion of food into energy integrates chemical reactions takingplace simultaneously throughout the body toassure that each organ has enough nutrients and is performing its job properly. An important prin- ciple central to metabolism is that the body's basicunit is the cell. Like a miniature body, each cell issurrounded by a skin, called a membrane. In turn,each cell contains tiny organs, called organelles,that p erfor m specic metabolic tasks.Body, Heal ThyselfCHAPTER 2 S Discovery By AccidentOne important type of metabolism that occurs constantly in our bodies is the reading and inter- preting of genes to make proteins. These proteinsunderlie the millions of chemical reactions that run our bodies. Proteins perform structural roles,keeping cells shaped properly. Proteins also work as enzymes that speed along chemical reactions \u2014 without an enzyme's assistance, many reactionswould take years to happen.The cell is directed by a \"command center,\" the nucleus, where the genes you inherited from your parents reside.

Metabolism \u2014 your body's way of making energy and body parts from food and water \u2014takes place in every cell in every organ. Complex, interlocking path- ways of cellular signals make up metabolism, linking together all the systems that make your body run. For this reason, researchers have a tough time understanding the process, because they are often faced with studying parts one by one or a few at a time. Nevertheless, scientists have learned a lot by focusing on individual metabolic pathways, such as the one that manufactures important regulatory molecules called prostaglandins (see page 21). Important enzymes called cytochrome P450s (CYP, pronounced \"sip,\" 450s) process essential molecules such as some hormonesand vitamins. The CYP 450 enzymes area major focus for pharmacologists becausethey metabolize \u2014either break down or activate \u2014hundreds of prescribed medicines and naturalsubstances. Scientists who specializein pharmacogenetics (see page 8) have dis-covered that the human genetic code containsmany different spellings for CYP 450 genes, resultingin CYP 450 proteins with widely variable levels ofactivity. Some CYP 450 enzymes also metabolizecarcinogens, making these chemicals \"active\" and more prone to causing cancer. Toxicologist Linda Quattrochi of the University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center is studying the roles played by certain CYP 450enzymes in the metabolism of carcinogens. Herresearch has revealed that natural components of certain foods, including horseradish, oranges, mustard, and green tea, appear to protect the body by blocking CYP 450 enzymatic activation of carcinogens.

Skin plays an important role in preservingfluid balance and in regulating body temperatureand sensation. Immune cells in skin help the bodyprevent and ght disease. When you get burned, allof these protections are in jeopardy. Burn-inducedskin loss can give bacteria and other microorgan-isms easy access to the nutrient-rich fluids thatcourse through the body, while at the same timeallowing these fluids to leak out rapidly. Enoughfluid loss can thrust a burn or trauma patient intoshock, so doctors must replenish skin lost to severeburns as quickly as possible. In the case of burns covering a signicant portion of the body, surgeons must do two thingsfast: strip off the burned skin, then cover theunprotected underlying tissue. These importantsteps in the immediate care of a burn patient took scientists decades to gure out, as theyperformed carefully conducted experiments onhow the body responds to burn injury. In the early1980s, researchers doing this work developed the rst version of an articial skin covering calledIntegra \u00aeDermal Regeneration Template, which doctors use to drape over the area where theburned skin has been removed.

In many cases, drugs end up where they are not needed and cause side effects, as we've already noted. What's more,drugs may encounter many different obstacleswhile journeying through the bloodstream.

This little white pill has been one of the mostwidely used drugs in history, and many say thatit launched the entire pharmaceutical industry. As a prescribed drug, aspirin is 100 years old. However, in its most primitive form, aspirin ismuch older. The bark of the willow tree containsa substance called salicin, a known antidote toheadache and fever since the time of the Greekphysician H ippocrates, around 400 B.C. The body conver ts salicin to an acidic substance called salicylate. Despit e its usefulness dating back to ancient times, early records indicate that salicylate wreaked havoc on the sto machs of people who ingested this natur al chemical. In the late 1800s, a scienticNational Institute of General Medical Sciences 20 /c6089 Acetylsalicylate is the aspirin of today. Adding a chemical tagcalled an acetyl group (shaded yellow box, right) to a moleculederived from willow bark (salicy-late, above) makes the moleculeless acidic (and easier on the lining of the digestive tract), butstill effective at relieving pain. Na + ClNa + ClSalicylate Acetylsalicylate (Aspirin)breakthrough turned willow-derived salicylate into a medicine friendlier to the body. Bayer \u00ae scientist Felix Hoffman discovered that adding a chemical tag called an acetyl group (see gure, page 20) to salicylate made the molecule less acidic and a little gentler on the stomach, but the chemicalchange did not seem to lessen the drug's ability to relieve his father's rheumatism. This molecule, acetylsalicylate, is the aspirin of today. Aspirin works by blocking the production of messenger molecules called prostaglandins.Because of the many important roles they play in me tabolism, prostag landins are important targets for drugs and are very interesting to pharma- cologists.Prostaglandins can help muscles relax and open up b lood vessels, they give you a fever when you're infected with bacteria, and they also marshal the immune sy stem by stimulating the process called inflammation. Sunburn, bee stings, tendinitis,and arthritis are just a few examples of painfulinflammation caused by the body's release of certaintypes of prostaglandins in response to an injury.Medicines By Design IBody, Heal Thyself 21 /c6092Inflammation leads to pain in arthritis.T o understand how enzymes like COX work, some pharmacologists use special biophysical techniques and X rays to determine the three-dimensional shapes of the enzymes. These kinds of experiments teach scientists about molecularfunction by providing clear pictures of how all thefolds and bends of an enzyme \u2014usually a protein or group of interacting proteins \u2014help it do its job. In drug development, one successful approachhas been to use this information to design decoysto jam up the working parts of enzymes like COX.Structural studies unveiling the shapes of COXenzymes led to a new c lass of drugs used to treat arthritis. Resear chers designed these drugs to selec- tively home in on one particular type of COX enzyme cal led CO X-2. By designing dr ugs that target only one form ofan enzyme like COX, pharmacologists may be able to create medicines that are great at stopping inflammation but have fewer side effects. Forexample, stomach upset is a common side effectcaused by NSAIDs that block COX enzymes. Thisside effect results from the fact that NSAIDs bindto different types of COX enzymes \u2014each of which has a slightly different shape. One of theseenzymes is called COX-1. While both COX-1 andCOX-2 enzymes make prostaglandins, COX-2beefs up the production of prostaglandins in sore,22 National Institute of General Medical Sciences Aspirin belongs to a diverse group of medicines called NSAIDs, a nickname for the tongue-twisting title nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs. Other drugs that belong t o this large class of medicines include Advil \u00ae, Aleve \u00ae, and many other popular pain relievers available without a doctor's prescription. All thesedrugs share aspirin's ability to knock back the production of prostaglandins by blocking anenzyme called cyclooxygenase. Known as COX,this enzyme is a critical driver of the body'smetabolism and immune function. COX makes p rostag landins and other similar mole cules c ollectively known as eicosanoids from a molecule cal led arachidonic acid. Named for the Greek wo rd eikos , meaning \"twenty,\" each eicosano id contains 20 atoms of carbon. You've also heard of the popular pain reliever acetaminophen (Tylenol \u00ae), which is famous for reducing fever and relieving headaches. However,scientists do not consider Tylenol an NSAID,because it does little to halt inflammation (remember that part of NSAID stands for \"anti-inflammatory\") . If your joints are aching from a long hike you weren't exactly in shape for, aspirin or Aleve may be better than Tylenolbecause inflammation is the thing making yourjoints hurt.Our Immune Army Scientists know a lot about the body's organ systems, but much more remains to be discovered.T o design \"smart\" drugs that will seek out diseased cells and not healthy ones, researchersneed to understand the body inside and out.One system in particular still puzzles scientists: the immune system. Even though researchers have accumulated vast amounts of knowledge about how our bodies ght disease using white blood cells and thousands of natural chemical weapons, a basic dilemma persists \u2014how does the b ody know what to ght? The immune sy stem constantly watches for foreigninflamed tissue, such as arthritic joints. In con-trast, COX-1 makes prostaglandins that protect the digestive tract, and blocking the production of these protective prostaglandins can lead to stomach upset, and even bleeding and ulcers. Very recently, scientists have added a new chapter to the COX story by identifying COX-3, which may be Tylenol's long-sought molecular target. Further research will help pharmacologistsunderstand more precisely how Tylenol andNSAIDs act in the body.Medicines By Design IBody, Heal Thyself 23 Common over-the-counter medicines used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation have many uses.Here are some of the terms used to describe theparticular effects of these drugs:ANTIPYRETIC \u2014this term means fever-reducing; it comes from the Greek word pyresis , which means re. ANTI-INFLAMMATORY \u2014this word describes a drug's ability to reduce inflammation, which cancause soreness and swelling; it comes from theLatin word flamma , which means flame.

This pro-tection, however, can run afoul if the bodyslips up and v iews its own tissue as foreign. Auto imm une disease, in which the immune system mistak enly atta cks and destroys body tissue that it believes to be foreign, can be the terrible consequence. The powerful immune army presents signi- cant roadblocks for pharmacologists trying tocreate new drugs. But some scientists have lookedat the immune system through a different lens.Why not teach the body to launch an attack on its own diseased cells? Many researchers arepursuing immunotherapy as a way to treat a wide range of health problems, especially cancer.With advances in biotechnology, researchers arenow able to tailor-produce in the lab modiedforms of antibodies immune system's front-line agents.Antibodies are spectacularly specic pro- teins that seek out and mark for destruction anything they do not recognize as belonging to the body. Scientists have learned how to join antibody-making cells with cells that grow and divide continuously.This strategy creates cellular \"factories\" that work around the clock to produce large quantities of specialized molecules, called monoclonal antibodies,that attach to and destroy single kinds of targets.Recently, researchers have also gured out how toproduce monoclonal antibodies in the egg whitesof chickens. This may reduce production costs of these incr easing ly imp ortant drugs. Docto rs are already using therapeutic mono- clonal ant ibodies to attack tumors.

Herceptin'sactions prevent breast cancer from spreading toother organs.

The most severe formof sepsis occurs when bacteria leak into the blood-stream, spilling their poisons and leading to adangerous condition called septic shock. Bloodpressure plunges dangerously low, the heart hasdifculty pumping enough blood, and body temper-ature climbs or falls rapidly. In many cases, multipleorgans fail and the patient dies. Despite the obvious public health importance of nding effective ways to treat sepsis, researchershave been frustratingly unsuccessful.

Tracey and his coworkers havediscovered an unexpected link between cytokines,the chemical weapons released by the immunesystem during sepsis, and a major nerve that con-trols critical body functions such as heart rate anddigestion. In animal studies, Tracey found thatelectrically stimulating this nerve, called the vagusnerve, signicantly lowered blood levels of TNF, acytokine that is produced when the body sensesthe presence of bacteria in the blood.

For decades, researchers have isolated andpuried individual enzymesfrom cells, performing experi- ments with these proteins to nd out how they do their job of speeding up chemical reac- tions. But to thoroughly understand a molecule's function, scientists have to take a very, v ery close look at how all the atoms t together and enable the molecular \"machine\" to work properly.

MAOB and its cousin MAO A work by removingmolecular pieces from neurotransmitters, part of the process of inactivating them. Scientists have developed drugs to block the actions of MAO enzymes, and by doing so, help preserve the levels of neurotransmitters inpeople with such disorders as Parkinson's disease and depr ession. Howeve r, MAO inhibitors have many undesirab le side e ffects.

Pharmacology research hasmade major strides in helping people deal with this problem. Scientists Michael Brown andJoseph Goldstein, both of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, won the 1985 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their fundamental work determining how the body metabolizes cholesterol. This research, part of which rst identied cholesterol receptors, led to the development of the popular cholesterol-lowering \"statin\" drugs such as Mevacor \u00aeand Lipitor\u00ae.

Photodynamic therapy is also being testedas a treatment for some skin and immune disorders. The key ingredient in this therapy is psoralen, a plant-derived chemical that has a peculiar prop-erty: It is inactive until exposed to light. Psoralen is the active ingredient in a Nile-dwelling weedcalled ammi. This remedy was used by ancientEgyptians, who noticed that people became prone to sunburn after eating the weed.

For example, nearly all of uswould succumb quickly to the poisonous bite of acobra, but it is harder to predict which of us willdevelop cancer from exposure to carcinogens likecigarette smoke. Toxicologists are researchers who study the effects of poisonous substances on livingorganisms. One toxicologist, Serrine Lau of theUniversity of Texas at Austin, is trying to unravelthe genetic mystery of why people are more or less susceptible to kidney damage after comingTweaking Nature Searching nature's treasure trove for potential medicines is often only the rst step. Having tappednatural resources to hunt for new medicines, pharma- ceutical scientists then work to gure out ways tocultivate natural products or to make them from scratch in the lab. Chemists play an essential role in turning marine and other natural products, which are often found in minute quantities, into useful medicines. In the case of Y ondelis, chemist Elias J. Corey of Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, deciphered nature's instructions on how to makethis powerful medicinal molecule. That's impor-tant, because researchers must harvest more than aton of Caribbean sea squirts to produce just 1 gram of the drug. By synthesizing drugs in a lab, scien-tists can produce thousands more units of a drug, plenty to use in patients if it proves effectiveagainst disease. Scientists are also beginning to use a relatively new procedure called combinatorial genetics to custom-make products that don't even exist in nature. Researchers have discovered ways to Toxicogenetics: Poisons and Your Geneseffects at lower doses. The researchers found, to their great surprise, that cyclosporine and FK506 were chemically very different. T o try to explainthis puzzling result, Harvard University organic chemist Stuart Schreiber (then at Y ale Universityin New Haven, Connecticut) decided to take on the challenge of guring out how to make FK506 in his lab, beginning with simple chemical building blocks. Schreiber succeeded, and he and scientists at Merck & Co., Inc. (Whitehouse Station, NewJersey) used the synthetic FK506 as a tool tounravel the molecular structure of the receptor for FK506 found on immune c ells. According to Schreiber, information about the receptor's structure from these experiments opened his eyes to c onsider an entirely new line of research. Schre iber reasoned that by custom-making small molecules in the lab, scientists could probethe function of the FK506 receptor to systemati-cally study how the immune system works. Sincethen, he and his group have continued to use synthetic small molecules to explore biology.Although Schreiber's strategy is not truly genetics,he calls the approach chemical genetics, becausethe method resembles the way researchers goabout their studies to understand the functions of genes.remove the genetic instructions for entire metabolicpathways from certain microorganisms, alter the instructions, and then put them back. This methodcan generate new and different \"natural\" products. Is It Chemistry or Genetics? Regardless of the way researchers nd new medicines, drug discovery often takes many unex- pected twists and turns. Scientists must train their eyes to look for new opportunities lurking in theoutcomes of their experiments. Sometimes, sidetrips in the lab can open up entirely new avenuesof discovery. Take the case of cyclosporine, a drug discovered three decades ago that suppresses the imm une system and thereby prevents the body from rejecting transplanted organs. Still a best-selling medicine, cyclosporine was a research breakthrough.The drug made it possible for surgeons to save thelives of many critically ill patients by transplantingorgans. But it's not hard to imagine that the veryproperties that make cyclosporine so powerful inputting a lid on the immune system can cause serious side effects, by damping immune functiontoo much. Y ears after the discovery of cyclosporine, researchers looking for less toxic versions of thisdrug found a natural molecule called FK506 thatseemed to produce the same immune-suppressingNational Institute of General Medical Sciences 34Medicines By Design IDrugs From Nature, Then and Now 35 In one traditional genetic approach, scientists alter the \"spelling\" (nucleotide components) of a gene and put the altered gene into a modelorganism \u2014for example, a mouse, a plant, or a yeast cell \u2014to see what effect the gene change has on the biology of that organism. Chemical genetics harnesses the power of chemistry to custom-produce any molecule and introduce it into cells, then look for biological changes thatresult. Starting with chemicals instead of genesgives drug development a step up. If the substancebeing tested produces a desired effect, such asstalling the g rowth of cancer cells, then the molecule can be c hemical ly manipulated in short order since the c hemist alr eady knows how to make it. These days, it's hard for scientists to know what to call themselves. As research worlds collide inwondrous and productive ways, the lines get blurrywhen it comes to describing your expertise. CraigCrews of Yale University, for example, mixes a com - bination of molecular pharmacology, chemistry, andgenetics. In fact, because of his multiple scienticcuriosities, Crews is a faculty member in threedifferent Yale departments: molecular, cellular, anddevelopmental biology; chemistry; and pharma-cology. You might wonder how he has time to getanything done. He's getting plenty done \u2014Crews is among a new breed of researchers delving into a growingscienti c area called chemical genetics (see main text). Taking this approach, scientists use chemistry to attack biological problems that traditionally havebeen solved through genetic experiments such asthe genetic engineering of bacteria, yeast, and mice.Crews' goal is to explore how natural productswork in living systems and to identify new targetsfor designing drugs. He has discovered how anBlending Sc ience /c6092 The herb feverfew (bache lor's button) contains a substance called parthenolide that appears to block inflammation. inflammation-ghting ingredient in the medicinal herb feverfew may work inside cells. He found that the ingredient, called parthenolide, appears to disable a key process that gets inflammation going. In the case of feverfew, a handful of controlled scientic studiesin people have hinted that the herb, also known byits plant name \"bachelor's button,\" is effective in com - bating migraine headaches, but further studies areneeded to confirm these preliminary ndings. T o translate pharmacology research into patient care, potential drugs ultimately have to be tested in people. This multistage processis known as clinical trials, and it has led researchers to validate life-saving treatmentsfor many diseases, such as childhood leukemiaand Hodgkin's disease. Clinical trials, though costly and very time-consuming, are the only way researchers can know for sure whetherexperimental treatments work in humans.Scientists conduct clinical trials in three phases (I, II, and III), each providing the answer to a different fundamental questionabout a potential new drug: Is it safe? Does it work? Is it better than the standard treatment?Typically, researchers do years of basic work inthe lab and in animal models before they can even consider testing an experimental treat- ment in people. Importantly, scientists whowish to test drugs in people must follow strictTesting...I, II, III National Institute of General Medical Sciences 36rules that are designed to protect those who volunteer to participate in clinical trials. Special groups called Institutional ReviewBoards, or IRBs, evaluate all proposed research involving humans to determine the potentialrisks and anticipated benets. The goal of anIRB is to make sure that the risks are mini- mized and that they are reasonable compared to the knowledge expected to be gained byperforming the study. Clinical studies cannotgo forward without IRB approval. In addition,people in clinical studies must agree to theterms of a trial by participating in a process calle d inf ormed consent and signing a form, required by law, that says they understand the risks and b enets involved in the study. Phase I studies test a dr ug's safety in a few dozen to a hundred people and are designed to gure out what happens to a drug in the body \u2014how it is absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. Phase I studies usually take severalmonths. Phase II trials test whether or not adrug produces a desired effect. These studiestake longer \u2014from several months to a few years \u2014and can involve up to several hundred patients.

Phase III studies involve hundreds to thou-sands of patients, and these advanced trials typically last several years. Many phase II and phase III studies are randomized,meaning that one group of patients gets the experimental drug being tested while a second, control group gets either a standardtreatment or placebo (that is, no treatment,often masked as a \"dummy\" pill or injection).Also, usually phase II and phase III studies are\"blinded\" \u2014the pat ients and the r esear chers do not know who is g etting the experimental drug .Final ly, once a new drug has completed phase III t esting ,a pharmaceutical company can r equest ap proval from the Food and Drug Administ ration to market the drug.s you've read so far, the most important goals of modern pharmacology are also the most obvious. Pharmacologists want to design, and be able to produce in sufcient quantity, drugs that will act in a specic way without toomany side effects. They also want to deliver thecorrect amount of a drug to the proper place in the body. But turning molecules into medicines is more easily said than done. Scientists struggle to fulll the twin challenges of drug design anddrug delivery.Medicine Hunting While sometimes the discovery of potential medi- cines falls to researchers' good luck, most oftenpharmacologists, chemists, and other scientists looking for new drugs plod along methodicallyfor years, taking suggestions from nature or cluesfrom knowledge about how the body works. Finding chemicals' cellular targets can educate scientists about how drugs work. Aspirin's moleculartarget, the enzyme cyclooxygenase, or COX(see page 22), was discovered this way in the early1970s in Nobel Prize-winning work by pharma-colog ist John V ane, then at the Royal College of Surgeons in L ondon, England. Another example is colchicine, a relatively old drug that is still widely used to treat gout, an excruciatingly painful type ofarthrit is in which needle-like crystals of uric acid c log joints, leading to swelling, heat, pain, andMolecules to Medicines CHAPTER 4 A As pet owners know, you canteach some old dogs new tricks. In a similar vein, scientists have in some cases found new uses for \"old\" drugs. Remarkably, the potential new uses oftenhave little in common with a drug's product label(its \"old\" use). For example, chemist Eric Oldeld of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaigndiscovered that one class of drugs called bisphos-phonates, which are currently approved to treatosteoporosis and other bone disorders, may also be useful for treating malaria, Chagas' disease, leishmaniasis, and AIDS-related infections like toxoplasmosis. Previous research by Oldeld and his coworkers had hinted that the active ingredient in thebisphosphonate medicines Fosamax \u00ae, Actonel\u00ae,and Aredia\u00aeblocks a critical step in the metabo- lism of parasites, the microorganisms that causethese diseases. To test whether this was true,Oldeld gave the medicines to ve different typesof parasites, each grown along with human cells in a plastic lab dish. The scientists found that smallamounts of the osteoporosis drugs killed the para-sites while sparing human cells. The researchersare now testing the drugs in animal models of theparasitic diseases and so far have obtained cures \u2014 in mice \u2014of certain types of leishmaniasis. If these studies prove that bisphosphonate drugs work inlarger animal models, the next step will be to nd out if the medicines can thwart these parasitic diseases in humans. /c6092Drugs used to treat bone ailments may be usefulfor treating infectious diseases like malaria.WHO/TDR/STAMMERSA Drug By Another Namemake blood clot and molecular signals that instruct blood vessels to relax. What the scientistsdid not know was how their candidate drugwould fare in clinical trials. Sildenal (Viagra's chemical name) did not work very well as a heart medicine, but many men who participated in the clinical testing phaseof the drug noted one side effect in particular:erections. Viagra works by boosting levels of a natural molecule called cyclic GMP that plays akey role in cell signaling in many body tissues.This molecule does a good job of opening bloodvessels in the penis, leading to an erection.stiffness. Lab experiments with colchicine ledscientists to this drug's molecular target, a cell- scaffolding protein called tubulin. Colchicineworks by attaching itself to tubulin, causing certain parts of a cell's architecture to crumble,and this action can interfere with a cell's abilityto move around. Researchers suspect that in the case of gout, colchicine works by halting the migration of immune cells called granulo-cytes that are responsible for the inflammationcharacteristic of gout. Current estimates indicate that scientists have identied roughly 500 to 600 molecular targets where medicines may have effects in the b ody. Medicine hunters can strategically \"discover\" drugs by designing molecules to \"hit\" these targ ets.That has already happened in some cases. Resear chers knew just what they were looking for when they designed the successfulAIDS drugs called HIV protease inhibitors.Previous knowledge of the three-dimensionalstructure of certain HIV proteins (the target)guided researchers to develop drugs shaped toblock their action. Protease inhibitors haveextended the lives of many people with AIDS. However, sometimes even the most targeted approaches can end up in big surprises. The NewY ork City pharmaceutical rm Pzer had a bloodpressure-lowering drug in mind, when instead itsscientists discovered Viagra \u00ae, a best-selling drug approved to treat erectile dysfunction.

If you think 25,000 genes is a lot (the number of genes in the human genome), realizethat each gene can give rise to different variationsof the same protein, each with a different molecular job. Scientists estimate that humans have hundreds of thousands of protein variants. Clearly, there's lotsof work to be done, which will undoubtedly keepresearchers busy for years to come. Recently, researchers made an exciting step forward in the treatment of cancer. Years of basic researchinvestigating circuits of cellular communication ledscientists to tailor-make a new kind of cancer medicine.In May 2001, the drug Gleevec was approved to treata rare cancer of the blood called chronic myelogenousleukemia (CML). The Food and Drug Administrationdescribed Gleevec's approval as \"...a testament to the groundbreaking scientic research taking place in labs throughout America.\" Researchers designed this drug to halt a cell- communication pathway that is always \"on\" in CML.Their success was founded on years of experimentsin the basic biology of how cancer cells grow. Thediscovery of Gleevec is an example of the successof so-called molecular targeting: understanding howdiseases arise at the level of cells, then guring outways to treat them. Scores of drugs, some to treatcancer but also many other health conditions, arein the research pipeline as a result of scientists'eavesdropping on how cells communicate.21st-Century Science While strategies such as chemical genetics can quicken the pace of drug discovery, otherapproaches may help expand the number of molecular targets from several hundred to severalthousand. Many of these new avenues of researchhinge on biology. Relatively new brands of research that are stepping onto center stage in 21st-century scienceinclude genomics (the study of all of an organism'sgenetic material), proteomics (the study of all of an organism's proteins), and bioinformatics(using c ompu ters to sift through large amounts of biological data). The \"omics\" revolution in National Institute of General Medical Sciences 40 /c6092Doctors use the drug Gleevec to treat a form of leukemia, a disease inwhich abnormally highnumbers of immune cells(larger, blood.A Chink in Cancer's Armorskin, nose, and lungs. Each of these methods bypasses the intestinal tract and can increase the amount of drug getting to the desired site ofaction in the body. Slow, steady drug delivery directly to the bloodstream \u2014without stopping at the liver rst \u2014is the primary benet of skin patches, which makes this form of drug delivery particularly useful when a chemical must be administered over a long period. Hormones such as testosterone, progesterone, and estrogen are available as skin patches. Theseforms of medicines enter the blood via a mesh-work ofsmal l arteries, veins, and capillaries in the skin. Resear chers also have developed skin patches for a w ide variety of other drugs. Some of these include Duragesic \u00ae(a prescrip tion-only pain Transderm Nitro \u00ae(a blood vessel- widening drug used to treat chest pain associatedwith heart disease). Despite their advantages,however, skin patches have a signicant drawback.Only very small drug molecules can get into thebody through the skin. Inhaling drugs through the nose or mouth is another way to rapidly deliver drugs and bypassthe liver. Inhalers have been a mainstay of asthmatherapy for years, and doctors prescribe nasalsteroid drugs for allergy and sinus problems.Rush Delivery Finding new medicines and cost-effective ways to manufacture them is only half the battle. An enor-mous challenge for pharmacologists is guring out how to get drugs to the right place, a task knownas drug delivery. Ideally, a drug should enter the body, go directly to the diseased site while bypassinghealthy tissue, do its job, and then disappear.Unfortunately, this rarely happens with the typicalmethods of delivering drugs: swallowing andinjection. When swallowed, many medicines madeof pr otein are never absorbed into the blood- stream because they are quickly chewed up by enzymes as they pass thr ough the digestive system. If the drug does get to the blood from the intes- tines, it falls prey to liver enzymes. For doctors prescribing such drugs, this rst-pass effect (see page 7) means that several doses of an oral drug are needed before enough makes it to the blood.Drug injections also cause problems, because theyare expensive, difcult for patients to self-administer,and are unwieldy if the drug must be taken daily.Both methods of administration also result influctuating levels of the drug in the blood, which is inefcient and can be dangerous. What to do? Pharmacologists can work around the rst-pass effect by delivering medicines via theMedicines By Design IMolecules to Medicines 41too small, and the particles will be exhaled. If clinical trials with inhaled insulin prove that it is safe and effective, then this therapy could make life much easier for people with diabetes.Researchers are investigating insulin powders that can be inhaled by people with diabetes who rely on insulin to control their blood sugar daily. Thisstill-experimental technology stems from novel uses of chemistry and engineering to manufactureinsulin particles of just the right size. T oo large,and the insulin particles could lodge in the lungs; Scientists try hard to listen to the noisy, garbled \"discussions\" that take place inside and betweencells. Less than a decade ago, scientists identiedone very important cellular communication streamcalled MAP ( mitogen- activated protein) kinase signaling. Today, molecular pharmacologists suchas Melanie H. Cobb of the University of TexasSouthwestern Medical Center at Dallas are studyinghow MAP kinase signaling pathways malfunction inunhealthy cells.Some of the interactions between proteins in these pathways involve adding and taking awaytiny molecular labels called phosphate groups.Kinases are the enzymes that add phosphategroups to proteins, and this process is called phos- phorylation. Marking proteins in this way assignsthe proteins a code, instructing the cell to do some - thing, such as divide or grow. The body employsmany, many signaling pathways involving hun - dreds of different kinase enzymes. Some of theimportant functions performed by MAP kinasepathways include instructing immature cells howto\"grow up\" to be specialized cell types like mus - cle cells, helping cells in the pancreas respond tothe hormone insulin, and even telling cells how todie. Since MAP kinase pathways are key to so many important cell processes, researchers considerthem good targets for drugs. Clinical trials areunder way to test various molecules that, in animalstudies, can effectively lock up MAP kinase signal-ing when it's not wanted, for example, in cancerand in diseases involving an overactive immunesystem, such as arthritis. Researchers predict that if drugs to block MAP kinase signaling proveeffective in people, they will likely be used in com - bination with other medicines that treat a variety of health conditions, since many diseases areprobably caused by simultaneous errors in multiplesignaling pathways.Protein Phosphorylated Protein Protein Kinase ATP ADP/c6089 Kinases that add phosphate groups(red-yellow structures) toproteins (green), assigningthe proteins a code.

Gordon Amidon,a pharmaceutical chemist at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, has been studying oneparticular transporter in mucosal membraneslining the digestive tract. The transporter, called hPEPT1, normally serves the body by ferrying small, electrically charged particles and smallprotein pieces called peptides into and out ofthe intestines. Amidon and other researchers discovered that certain medicines, such as the antibiotic penicillin and certain types of drugs used to treat high bloodpressur e and heart fail ure, also travel into the intest ines via hP EPT1. Rece nt experiments revealed that the herpes dr ug \u00aeand the AIDS drug R etrov ir\u00aealso hit ch a r ide into int es- c ells using the hPEPT1 t ransp orter. Amidon wants to extend this list by synthesizing hundreds of different molecules and testing them for their ability to use hPEPT1 and other similar trans-porters. Recent advances in molecular biology,genomics, and bioinformatics have sped the searchfor molecules that Amidon and other researcherscan test.Medicines By Design IMolecules to Medicines 43 /c6092Proteins that snake through membranes help transport molecules into cells. HTTP://WWW.PHARMACOLOGY.UCLA.EDU Transportation Dilemmas Scient ists are sol ving the dilemma of drug delivery with a varie ty of other clever techniques. Many ofthe t echniques are geared toward sneaking throug h the cellular gate-keeping systems' membr anes. The challenge is a chemistry problem \u2014most drugs are water-soluble, but membranes are oily. Water and oil don't mix, and thus many drugs can't enter the cell. T o make matters worse, size matters too. Membranes areusually constructed to permit the entry of onlysmall nutrients and hormones, often through private cellular alleyways called transporters. Many pharmacologists are working hard to devise ways to work not against, but with nature,Scientists are also trying to slip molecules through membranes by cloaking them in disguise. Steven Regen of Lehigh University in Bethlehem,Pennsylvania, has manufactured miniature chemical umbrellas that close around and shield a molecule when it encounters a fatty membraneand then spread open in the watery environment inside a cell. So far, Regen has only used test mole- cules, not actual drugs, but he has succeeded ingetting molecules that resemble small segments of DNA across membranes. The ability to do thisin humans could be a crucial step in successfullydeliver ing therapeutic molecules to cells via gene therap y.Act Like a Membrane Researchers know that high concentrations of chemotherapy drugs will kill every single cancercell growing in a lab dish, but getting enough of these powerful drugs to a tumor in the body with-out killing too many healthy cells along the wayhas been exceedingly difcult. These powerful drugs can do more harm than good by severely sickening a patient during treatment. Some researchers are using membrane-like particles called liposomes to package and deliverdrugs to tumors. Liposomes are oily, microscopiccapsules that can be lle d with biological cargo, such as a dr ug. They are very, very small \u2014only Scientists who study anesthetic medicines have a daunting task \u2014for the most part, they are \"shooting in the dark\" whenit comes to identifying the molecular targets of these drugs. Researchers doknow that anesthetics share one commoningredient: Nearly all of them somehowtarget membranes, the oily wrappings surrounding cells. However, despite thefact that anesthesia is a routine part ofsurgery, exactly how anesthetic medicines work in the body has remained a mystery for morethan 150 years. It's an important problem, sinceanesthetics have multiple effects on key body func-tions, including critical processes such as breathing. Scientists dene anesthesia as a state in which no movement occurs in response to what shouldbe painful. The problem is, even though a patientloses a pain response, the anesthesiologist can'ttell what is happening inside the person's organsand cells. Further complicating the issue, scientistsknow that many different types of drugs \u2014with little physical resemblance to each other \u2014can all produce anesthesia. This makes it difcult to trackdown causes and effects. Anesthesiologist Robert Veselis of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research in NewYork City claried how certain types of these mys-terious medicines work. Veselis and his coworkersmeasured electrical activity in the brains of healthyvolunteers receiving anesthetics while they listenedto different sounds. To determine how sedated thepeople were, the researchers measured reactiontime to the sounds the people heard. To measurememory effects, they quizzed the volunteers at theend of the study about word lists they had heardbefore and during anesthesia. Veselis' experimentsshow that the anesthetics they studied affect sepa-rate brain areas to produce the two different effectsof sedation and memory loss. The ndings may help doctors give anesthetic medicines more effectively and safely and prevent reactions with other drugsa patient may be taking. National Institute of General Medical Sciences 44 Anesthesia D issecteddogs revealed that, when heated, the drug-laden caps ules flooded tumors with a chemotherapy drug and kil led the canc er cells inside. Researchers hope to soon begin the rst stage of human studies testing the heat-triggered liposome treatment in patients with prostate and breast cancer. The resultsof these and later clinical trials will determinewhether liposome therapy can be a useful weaponfor treating breast and prostate cancer and otherhard-to-treat solid tumors.one one-thousandth the width of a single humanhair. Researchers have known about liposomes for many years, but getting them to the right placein the body hasn't been easy. Once in the blood- stream, these foreign particles are immediatelyshipped to the liver and spleen, where they are destroyed. Materials engineer David Needham of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, is investi-gating the physics and chemistry of liposomes tobetter understand how the liposomes and theircancer-ghting cargo can travel through the body.Needham w orked for 10 years to create a special kind o fliposo me that melts at just a few degrees above body temperature. The end result is a tiny molecular \"soccer ball\" made from two different oils that w rap around a drug. At room tempera- ture, the liposomes are solid and they stay solid at body temperature, so they can be injected into thebloodstream. The liposomes are designed to spilltheir drug cargo into a tumor when heat is appliedto the cancerous tissue. Heat is known to perturbtumors, making the blood vessels surroundingcancer cells extra-leaky. As the liposomes approachthe warmed tumor tissue, the \"stitches\" of theminiature soccer balls begin to dissolve, rapidlyleaking the liposome's contents.

Ultimately, the scientists hope to test drugs and learn about disease throug h computer modeling experiments with the virtual cell system.membrane is called signal transduction, and itoccurs in three steps. First, a message (such as epinephrine) encounters the outside of a celland makes contact with a molecule on the surface called a receptor. Next, a connectingtransducer, or switch molecule, passes themessage inward, sort of like a relay baton. Finally, in the third step, the signal gets ampli- ed, prompting the cell to do something:move, produce new proteins, even send outmore signals. One of the Nobel Prize winners, pharma- cologist Alfred G. Gilman of the University of T exas S outh western Medical Center at Dallas, uncovered the identity of the switch molecule, calle d a G p rotein. Gilman named the switch, whic h is a ctually a huge family of switch mol- ecules, not after himself but after the type of cellular fuel it uses: an energy currency calledGTP . As with any switch, G proteins must beturned on only when needed, then shut off.Some illnesses, including fatal diseases likecholera, occur when a G protein is errantly left on. In the case of cholera, the poisonousweaponry of the cholera bacterium \"freezes\"in place one particular type of G protein thatcontrols water balance.
