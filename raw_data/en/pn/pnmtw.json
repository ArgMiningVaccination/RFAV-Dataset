Page 11 Part II: Safety specification Part II: Module SI - Epidemiology of the indication(s) and target population (s) Indication: Active immunisation to prevent COVID -19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 12 years of age and older. Incidence and prevalence: At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. The virus rapidly spread, resulting in an epidemic throughout China, followed by a global pandemic. In February 2020, the World Health Organis ation (WHO) designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. The virus that causes COVID-19 is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As of 13 February 2022 ( Figure SI.1) , there were just over 409 million confirmed cases of COVID -19 worldwide and over 5.8 million deaths ( WHO 2022 ). The global incidence/number of new COVID -19 cases decreased by 19% in one week. All regions, including the WHO Europe region, reported a decline. Globally, the number of deaths as of 13 February 2022 remained similar to the week before. At the end of week six (6) 2022 (week ending Sunday, 13 February 2022), the overall epidemiological situation in the European Union/European Economic Area ( EU/EEA ) was characterised by a very high overall case notificat ion rate that has been decreasing for two weeks. T he weekly case and death incidence rates were 2,962 new cases per 100 ,000 population and 54.7 deaths per 1 ,000,000 population respectively. However, t he overall EU/EEA death rate remained elevated but stable . As of week six (6) 2022, 160,539,407 cases and 1,788,613 deaths have been reported in the EU/EEA (ECDC 2022a ). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) reported that as of week six (6) 2022 (week ending Sunday, 13 February 2022), of 27 countries with data on severe cases defined as hospital/ICU admissions or occupancy up to then, 14 reported an increasing trend in at least one of these indicators compared to the previous week ( ECDC 2022b). NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 12 F igure SI. 1: COVID-19 C ases R eported Weekly by WHO Region and Global D eaths, as of 13 February 2022 ( WHO 2022 ) NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 13 The reported case counts underestimate the overall burden of COVID-19, as only a fraction of acute infections which are diagnosed and reported. Seroprevalence surveys in th e US and Europe have suggested that after accounting for potential false positives or negatives, the rate of prior exposure to SARS -CoV-2, as reflected by seropositivity, may exceed the incidence of reported cases by approximately 10-fold or more ( Stringhini 2020; Havers 2020 ). Demographics and R isk Factors Individuals of both genders of all age groups can acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection. From the start of the pandemic, men are more likely than women to suffer from severe COVID-19 that requires hospitalisation, intensive care, and/or mechanical ventilatio n once hospitalised, including death. The older people are, the more severely they are affected ( CDC 2021a ). Across WHO regions, men make up a higher proportion of hospitalisations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths, with the exception of the African Region (AFRO) region. However, this divergence is being driven by data from South Africa, without which the AFRO region mirrors the global pattern ( Global Health 5050 2021). Similar to the US, there is an overall increase by older age adults for severe outcomes; among older adults, males are more likely than females to experience severe outcomes, including mortality (ECDC 2021). The overall risk of COVID-19 in children in the EU/EEA and UK is currently considered low, based on a low probability of COVID-19 in children and a moderate impact of such disease ( Irfan 2021). Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with -CoV- 2 (PIMS -TS) is a new, rare, post-infectious complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. PIMS -TS is a distinct post-infectious entity unlike the primary respiratory manifestations and outcomes seen in both adult and pa ediatric patients with COVID -19 ( Penner 2021). The overall risk of PIMS-TS in children in the EU/EEA and the UK is considered low, based on a very low probability of PIMS-TS in children and a high impact of such disease ( ECDC 2022). COVID-19 hospitalisation rates among children have varied throughout the pandemic. Weekly hospitalisation rates among children <18 years in the US peaked initially in January 2021 (1.5 per 100,000 population), peaked again in September 2021 with predominance of the Delta variant (1.8 per 100,000 population), and then again in January 2022 with predominance of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant (7.1 per 100,000 population) (COVID -NET 2022, CDC 2022). During the Omicron surge, hospitalisation rates were particularly high in children aged 0 to 4 years, who were not eligible for vaccination (15.6 per 100,000 population). Despite increasing numbers of hospitalis ations with Delta and Omicron variants, the proportions of hospitalised children requiring intensive care or invasive mechanical ventilation was similar with Delta (and lower with Omicron) than with earlier circulating strains (CDC 2022). Although long COVID exists in children, estimates of the prevalence of persisting symptoms based on scarce literature range from 2% to 27%. In a study in Switzerland, 4 of 109 seropositive children (4%) vs 28 of 1,246 seronegative ones (2%) reported at least 1 symptom lasting beyond 12 weeks. Of those, the most frequently reported symptoms were tiredness (3%), difficulty concentrating (2%), and increased need for sleep (2%) ( Radtke 2021 ). Adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19. Severe illness from COVID-19 is defined as hospitalisation, admission to the ICU, intubation or mechanical ventilation. These medical conditions may be more important and intervening during the stage of disease and during therapy. The m ost important NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 14 underlying conditions that may increase the risk for COVID-19 severity (per CDC, ECDC, and Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment [RIVM]) include: cancer, chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, or cardiomyopathies , sickle cell disease, smoking , and diabetes mellitus (DM). Impact on Socially V ulnerable G roups Residents of long- term care facilities (LTCF) are a medically and socially vulnerable group to COVID-19 because they are more liable to suffer from the consequences of the COVID-19 infection and disease ( ECDC 2021). Seven EU countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands , and Slovenia) reported data (Week 27, 05 July 2021 to 11 July 2021). Among these countries, the pooled incidence of COVID -19 cases among LTCF residents was 9.1 per 100,000 LTCF beds with a pooled incidence of fatal COVID-19 cases of 0.5 per 100,000 LTCF beds. LTCF residents were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, experiencing high morbidity and mortality during the earlier waves of the pandemic. The Dutch RIVM performed a study and found that the indirect effects of COVID-19 were also noted (RIVM 2020). The study showed that access to regular health care has (temporarily) been limited; lifestyles have changed; and social life has been impoverished as a result of coronavirus measures. The social effects of the COVID -19 crisis have a greater impact on vulnerable groups in society, such as lower -educated adults, young people, the elderly, and people with underlying health problems. This impact not only concerns the direct, immediate consequences but also the indirect, future consequences. The study showed that more people had started to live unhealthier lives during the COVID-19 crisis. Smokers smoked more frequently, and nearly 30% of people had put on weight and 53% of people indicated that they were exercising less. RIVM has also observed an increase in the burden of disease due to delays in specialised care such as planned interventions. In the first months of the COVID crisis for instance 25,000 cataract surgeries and 10,000 hip and knee replacement surgeries were not performed as planned. In terms of health loss, this means an increase of 2,000 disability- adjusted life years (DALYs) for cataracts (15% increase) and 3,000 DALYs (2% increase) for knee and hip arthritis. Mental health is also under pressure due to the COVID- 19 crisis. One -third of the population felt more despondent, and one-third felt more stressed and anxious during the crisis than before. In addition, people had fewer opportunities to work from home, and their jobs tended to be less secure. The Main Existing T reatment O ptions: Management of P ersons with COVID -19 Management of COVID -19 is based on best supportive care and emerging standard of care, with protective effects demonstrated in clinical studies for some drugs and interventions, such as mechanical ventilation, the antiviral remdesivir, the anti -inflammatory steroid dexamethasone, molnupiravir and Paxlovid. Virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibody therapies be where indicated use ( Veiga 2021; Wolf 2021; Wen 2022). Prophylaxis At the data lock point (DLP) of this RMP, the following vaccines were registered in the EU for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV- 2 virus: Comirnaty (Pfizer), Vaxzevria NVX (Moderna), and COVID -19 Vaccine (Janssen [Johnson & Johnson]). In addition, Evusheld, made of the two monoclonal antibodies tixagevimab and cilgavimab, has been granted a marketing authorisation in the EU for the prevention of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age weighing at least 40 kg before potential exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus (EMA 2022). General preventative measures include social distancing, face masks, and proper hygiene. Primary S eries A vaccination campaign is ongoing in the EU/EEA. As of 13 February 2022, the cumulative uptake of the primary course of COVID-19 vaccination in the EU/EEA was 82.2% (country range: 34.7-94.4%) among adults aged 18 years and older and 71.0% (country range: 29.1-85.4%) in the total population. The cumulative vaccine uptake among people aged under 18 years is 18.6% (29 countries reporting), 70.2% in 1517- year-olds . Boosters Currently, many EU/EEA countries are recommending booster doses at a defined interval following primary vaccination. For immunocompromised individuals, all 30 EU/EEA countries recommend an additional primary dose as an extension of the primary vaccination course. Twenty countries also recommend a booster dose for immunocompromised individuals following the extended primary three- dose vaccination series (i.e. , four doses). For the general population, all 30 countries also recommend first booster doses to different age groups due to waning protection. Half of the EU/EEA countries (15/30) recommend booster doses for all adults aged 18 years and over and for adolescents over 12 years of age ( ECDC 2022a ). As of 05 April 2022, nine countries (Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands and Sweden) recommend a second booster dose (fourth dose) for different vulnerable population groups such as residents in LTCF and the elderly, with different age cut- offs. The recommendations for a fourth dose for vulnerable people and certain at-risk groups aim to restore serological responses and overall vaccine efficacy (ECDC 2022a ). The cumulative uptake of a booster/additional dose was 58.5% (country range: 10.2-84.8%) among adults aged 18 years and older and 48.3% (country range: 8.4-67.1%) in the total population ( ECDC 2022a ). Clinical Manifestations and Natural H istory In a review of four large population-based, cross-sectional surveys, the median proportion of individuals who had no symptoms at the time of a positive test was 46% (range : 43% to 77%) . In 14 longitudinal studies, a median of 73% of initially asymptomatic in dividuals remained asymptomatic on follow-up. If a similar proportion remained asymptomatic in the four large, representative, polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) based studies, in which the median was 45.6%, the asymptomatic fraction of SARS -CoV-2 infection would be ( Oran 2021) . In other publications , asymptomatic 43 58% are mentioned 2020; Sakurai 2020). NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 16 Cough, myalgias, and headache are the most commonly reported symptoms ( Stokes 2020). Other symptoms are fever, dyspnea, sore throat, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, loss of smell or taste, abdominal pain, and rhinorrhea. These symptoms may range from mild to critical. Some patients with initially non -severe symptoms may progress over the course of about a week (Cohen 2020) with pneumonia, respiratory failure, cardiac and cardiovascular complications, thromboembolic complications, neurologic complic ations, inflammatory 2020), multiorgan failure ( Mokthari 2020) and secondary infections. A fraction of the COVID-19 patients who undergo a variable acute symptomatic phase of the disease are coming forward with continuing effects of the disease, with complaints like mental fog, delayed latent periods in recalling events of recent past, tachycardia, extreme fatigue, inability to perform daily physical tasks, to name a few of a complex series of signs and symptoms. The signs and symptoms are so diverse and related to multiorgan involvement and systems ( Baig 2021; Rubin 2020). Based on a recently published study ( Bellan 2021) the most common persistent symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, and cognitive deficits. Data also suggest the potential for ongoing respiratory impairment. Despite virological recovery, a sizable proportion of patients with COVID-19 experi enced respiratory, functional, or psychological sequelae months after hospital discharge. A t four months after discharge, respiratory, physical, and psychological sequelae were common among patients who had been hospitalis ed for COVID -19. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the most commonly reported symptoms during the acute phase but largely remitted in the following months. However, 13 patients (5.5%) still reported dyspnea at 4 months after discharge. At 4 months, 12 patients (5.0%) still experienced ageusia and 11 patients (4.6%) still experienced anosmia. Additionally, 14 patients (5.9%) reported still experiencing arthralgia at follow-up, and 14 patients (5.9%) reported still experiencing myalgia. Although age is a major factor associated with COVID- 19- related mortality, 4 months after hospital discharge, there was not a higher residual symptomatic burden in the older patients in this study ( Bellan 2021). In the pa ediatric population, an Italian Multicenter study concluded that complications of COVID -19 in children are related to the presence of co -morbidities. The length of hospital stay and the risk of complications increase with age: thus, the older the child, the closer the infection may resemble the adult one. Viral co- infections are additional risk factors for disease progression and high C-r eactive protein ( CRP ) levels and lymphopenia may be predictive markers of severe clinical pictures. Outside multisystem inflammatory syndrome ( MIS-C), most children with COVID -19 require only supportive therapy (Garazzino 2021 ). The clinical presentation in children is heterogeneous, including a wide spectrum of clinical features. Fever and cough are the most commonly reported presenting symptoms. Children predominantly contracted a mild form of infection but could be at risk of more severe outcomes. It is crucial to take into consideration risk factors including contact exposure, underlying comorbidities, young age, and male sex which may increase the risk of severe disease. Symptoms in children may be unrecognis ed before the diagnosis. Among non-hospitalised children < 18 years of age, 89% experienced one or NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 17 more typical symptoms of COVID -19, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and 22% experienced all three ( Burke 2020). SARS -CoV-2 Variants Viruses constantly change through mutation, and new variants of a virus are expected to occur. Sometimes new variants emerge and disappear. Other times, new variants persist. Numerous variants of the virus that causes COVID- 19 are being tracked in the EU and globally during this pandemic. The introduction and increased spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants have raised concerns since the start of the pandemic. Since 21 January 2021, in the EU a substantial increase has been seen in the number and proportion of cases of the Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), Delta (B.1.617.2) and Lambda (C.37) variants . All variants spread faster or even much faster ( Delta ) than their predecessors. There is evidence pointing to the pote ntial for reduced effectiveness for some of the COVID-19 vaccines with variant strains (CDC 2021b). The ECDC listed the current variants of concern (VOC) the EU/EEA ( ECDC 2022c ). For these variants, clear evidence is available indicating a significant impact on transmissibility, severity and/or immunity that is likely to have an impact on the epidemiological situation in the EU/EEA (see Table SI.1). As of week six (6), 2022, t he estimate d distribution (median and range of values from 23 countries for weeks 4 to 5, 24 January - 6 February 2022) of variants of concern During the same period, B.1.1.529 (Omicron) was the dominant variant (accounting for >50% of sequenced viruses) in all of the 23 EU/EEA countries with adequate sequencing volume ( variants of interest are for which evidence is available on genomic properties, epidemiological evidence or in-vitro evidence that could imply a significant impact on transmissibility, severity an d/or immunity, realistically having an impact on the epidemiological situation in the EU/EEA. However, the evidence is still preliminary or is associated with major uncertainty. As of 24 February 2022, there were no variants of interest identified.

Page 18 Ta ble SI. 1: Variants of C oncern in the EU/EEA as of art II: Module clinical P art of the S afety S pecification No risks have been identified in the non- clinical testing programme , and the data support the proposed dose and regimen for human use (i.e., 5 \u00b5g SARS -CoV-2 rS with 50 \u00b5g Matrix -M adjuvant administered on Days 0 and 21 [+7 days] ). Studies acr oss multiple species immunised with SARS -CoV-2 rS , including non-human primate models administered the intended human dose, have shown no evidence of vaccine- enhanced disease following challenge with live SARS -CoV-2 virus, even when administered at suboptimal vaccine doses (i.e., single doses and/or lower antigen/adjuvant doses). In a repeat-dose toxicity study in rabbits, 50 \u00b5g SARS -CoV -2 rS with or without 50 \u00b5g Matrix -M adjuvant was well tolerated with non - adverse findings limited to local injection site inflammation and serum chemical markers of inflammation, which were transient and considered consistent with immune system stimulation consequent to immunisation. Data from a developmental and reproductive toxicity study in rats indicate no adverse findings on fertility, pregnancy/lactation, or development of the embryo/foetus and offspring through post- natal Day 21.

In the uterine cohort, there was no difference between f oetal body weights, survival, or fo etal external , visceral , or skeletal exams. In the developmental cohort, there were no differences in number of male and female pups, pup body weights, survival, litter size and sex, developmental markers, or gross pathology findings. SARS -CoV -2 rS with Matrix -M adjuvant elicited robust anti- S IgG titers with a 100% seroconversion rate. Maternal anti -S IgG antibodies were detected in both fetal and pup samples confirming transfer of antibodies during gestational and postnatal stages of development; albeit pups exhibited significantly higher levels of maternal antibodies than foetuses .

Page 21 The A djuvant Matrix -M is a saponin-based adjuvant manufactured by mixing defined, partially purified extracts of the bark of the Quillaja saponaria Molina tree, termed Fraction -A and Fraction- C. Saponins are a class of chemical compounds found naturally in various plant species, with uses in a variety of applications including agriculture, animal feeds, human foods and beverages, mining, and commercial veterinary vaccines (e.g., vaccines against foot- and-mouth disease, bovine mastitis, feline leukemia, and equine influenza). The adjuvanting property of saponins to boost both humoral and cellular immune responses to antigens that are generally poor immunogens in veterinary vaccines has precipitated the exploration of saponin-based adjuvants in human vaccines as well. The proposed mode of action for saponin-based adjuvants is through a combination of activities including recruitment and activation of innate immune cells, rapid antigen delivery to antigen -presenting cells, and enhanced antigen presentation via both major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and MHC II molecu les in the draining lymph nodes. The toxicology data obtained in animal studies to evaluate Matrix-M adjuvant, alone or co-administered with different vaccine antigens, does not demonstrate relevant systemic or organ- specific toxicities and Matrix -M adjuva nt administration was generally well tolerated. There were transient and inconsistent reductions in body weight and red cell mass parameters, as well as temperature elevations in some studies but these findings tended to resolution following the recovery period. Local injection site inflammation and regional lymph node hyperplasia consistent with active immunis ation were present in acute necropsies but showed resolution at recovery time points.

SIV.1 Exclusion C riteria in C linical S tudies within the D evelopment P rogramme Table SIV. 1: Exclusion Criteria in Clinical Studies within the Development Programme Criterion Reason for E xclusion Included as Missing Information Rationale (if not included as missing information) Any acute (within 14 days prior to the study vaccination) or chronic clinically significant illness and/or fever Allowance of these conditions would confound assessment of safety , and these febrile participants might already be infected with SARS- CoV -2. It is common medical practice to not adm inister vaccines in febrile participants. Febrile participants with minor illnesses could be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator. This is managed with the product prescribing information . No It is common medical practice to not administer vaccines in febrile participants as this would not allow accurate assessment of whether the vaccine induces fever. Previous clinical or laboratory - confirmed diagnosis of COVID- 19 Studies 501, 301, and 302 excluded participants with laboratory-c onfirmed COVID - 19 because these participants would confound assessment of efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety. No Safety in study participants with prior infection will be assessed in the pivotal studies. Any autoimmune or immunodeficiency disease/condi tion or being treated with a biologic therapy Immunocompromised participants may have impaired immune responses to vaccines and would therefore limit the ability to demonstrate efficacy, which is the primary pivotal endpoint. Yes Not applicable; u se in individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders is included as missing information. NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 27 T able SIV. 1: Exclusion Criteria in Clinical Studies within the Development Programme Criterion Reason for E xclusion Included as Missing Information Rationale (if not included as missing information) Known disturbance of coagulation; Bleeding disorder (e.g., factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or platelet disorder), or prior history of significant bleeding or bruising following intramuscular ( IM) injections or veni puncture (Study 302) Participants have a potential risk of hematoma due to the puncture of the deep tissues. Allowance of these conditions would confound assessment of safety. No It is common medical practice not to administer a product by the IM route in participants with coagulopathy or bleeding disorders although the use of a needle with proper gauge can decrease the risk. Drugs or alcohol abuse or drug addiction within one year prior to the first study vaccination. Participants with drug or alcohol abuse or drug addiction within 1 year prior to the first study vaccination are considered less likely to comply with study procedures and complete the long- term safety follow -up required by the study protocols. No Study 302: Suspected or known current alcohol or drug dependence. While these participants were to be excluded per the protocol, participants are not always forthcoming regarding this aspect of their medical history and it is assumed that a not inconsequential number were actually enrolled . Allergies to products contained in the investigational product. Any history of anaphylaxis to any prior vaccine ( Study 302) Participants with medical history significant for allergic reactions following vaccines are at increased risk for hypersensitivity reactions when receiving another vaccine. No It is common medical practice to not administer a new vaccine in participants who have a history of significant allergic reactions to other vaccines. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant during the study To avoid use in a vulnerable population. Clinical development generally does not initially investigate benefit/risk in pregnant women . Yes Not applicable; use in pregnan cy and while breastfeeding is included as missing information.

NOTE: An influenza co- administration sub -study of Study 302 was conducted in which approximately 400 participants received a single dose of seasonal influenza vaccine at the same time as first study vaccination. In addition, a licensed seasonal influenza vaccine may be given 7 days after each vaccination but should not be given within 7 days prior to second vaccination ( Study 302) Received influenza vaccination or any other adult vaccine within 4 days prior to or within 7 days after either study vaccination ( Study 301) Allowance of this condition would confound assessment of safety and efficacy. Yes Not applicable; interaction with other vaccines is included as missing information. Participant requires the use of continuous oxygen therapy or any oxygen therapy while awake or is anticipated to require daytime oxygen therapy during the course of the study. (Study 302) Participants requiring the use of continuous oxygen therapy or any oxygen therapy while awake and with a baseline oxygen saturation less than 95% were excluded due to feasibility issues regarding the ability to characterize their disease severity while on oxygen. No While participants requiring oxygen therapy were excluded, participants with stable COPD and other pulmonary diseases were included. Paediatric participants < 12 years of age Clinical development program mes generally investigate first the benefit - risk in adults. In adults, the risk of symptomatic and severe COVID- 19 usually seems higher . No A paediatric investigation plan has been agreed with the Agency on 15 October 2021.

Page 29 SIV. 2 Limitations to D etect A dverse R eaction s in C linical T rial D evelopment P rogrammes Rare Adverse Drug Reactions With the vaccine -exposed study population (30,058 subjects ) events with a frequency of 1/10,000 persons or 0.01% can be detected . Most rare A Es of special interest (AESIs) for post- marketing safety surveillance have incidence rates lower than 2/10,000 persons or 0.02%. Adverse Drug Reactions of Long Latency The primary series vaccination regimen is two doses administered 21 days apart (+ 7 days), so there is no prolonged nor cum ulative exposure to the vaccine. The pooled safety analysis was performed once the median follow-up duration of at least 2 months after vaccination was completed. The median duration of follow-up for the adult participants was 78 days post-dose 2, with 32,993 (66%) participants of all the total number of participants (active and placebo) completing more than 2 months follow-up post-dose 2. However, the planned duration of follow-up in all clinical trials except Study 301 is up to 1 year; Study 301 will follow partic ipants up to 2 years. In the p aediatric expansion study 2019nCoV-301, the duration of follow-up for pa ediatric participants 12 to < 18 years of age was at least 60 days and may continue until 2 years. Therefore, there has been limited opportunity to observe potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that might occur with more prolonged latency beyond the 2- year follow-up period. Studies 2019nCoV-101 (Part 2) and 2019nCoV-501 evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a single booster dose of NVX-CoV2373 administered approximately 6 months after the primary vaccination series.

Risk s not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP Not all adverse reactions for the vaccine are considered to meet the level of importance/severity compared to the condition to be prevented necessitating inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. Reason for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the RMP: Risks with minimal and temporary clinical impact on patients (in relation to th e severity of the disease prevented) : Injection site tenderness , injection site pain, i njection site redness , injection site swelling , injection site pruritus Fatigue Malaise Headache Myalgia Arthralgia Nausea Vomiting Pyrexia in extremity Rash Lymphadenopathy ErythemaNVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 33 Urticaria Hypertension Known risks that do not impact the risk -benefit profile: Anaphylaxis Further considerations for COVID -19 vaccines Reactogenicity (local and systemic) In accordance with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) requirements ( Consideration on core RMP requirements for COVID -19 vaccines guidance), the reactogenicity profile of NVX-CoV2373 is described below for local and systemic reactions, including observed differences between ages (younger and older groups) and after any dose of NVX-CoV2373. The observed differences do not impact the safety profile of the NVX-CoV2373. Participants 18 years of age and older Local injection site reactions: I njection site tenderness and injection site pain were reported in clinical studies as very commonly ( 1/10) occurring ADRs following IM injection of NVX-CoV2373. Injection site redness/ injection site erythema and injection site swelling were commonly reported ( 1/100 to < 1/10) following IM injection . Injection pruritus was uncommonly reported ( 1/1,000 to < 1/100). Local adverse reactions were generally mild or moderate in severity with a median duration of less than or equal to 2 days following vaccination. Specific guidance on the administration of Nuvaxovid for healthcare professionals ( HCPs ) is provided in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC ), and this is fully aligned with standard clinical practice for the management of local injection site reactions following immunisation. Systemic reactions : Systemic reactions including fatigue, malaise /influenza- like illness , headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, and vomiting were reported in clinical studies as very commonly occurrin g ADRs ( 1/10). Pyrexia , chills , and in extremity observed as commonly reported ( 1/100 to < 1/10) ADRs in lymphadenopathy, 1/1,000 to < 1/100). These systemic ADRs were usually mild to moderate in severity with a media n duration of less than or equal to 1 day following vaccination . These ADRs are listed in the Nuvaxovid SmPC. These risks are considered non-serious and have minimal clinical impact. Overall, there was a higher incidence of adverse reactions in younger age groups: the incidence of injection site tenderness, injection site pain, fatigue, myalgia, headache, malaise, arthralgia, and nausea or vomiting was higher in adults aged 18 to < 65 years than in those aged 65 years and above 65. Local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than afterDose 1. Participants 12 through 17 years of age The safety of NVX -CoV2373 in part icipants 12 through 17 years of age was evaluated in an interim analysis of the paediatric expansion portion of an ongoing Phase 3 multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Safety data was collected in 2,232 participants 12 through 17 years of age, with and without evidence of prior infection, in the US who received at least one dose of NVX-NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 34 CoV2373 (n=1,487) and placebo (n=745). Demographic characteristics were similar among participants who received NVX-CoV2373 and those who received placebo. Local injection site reactions : The most frequent local adverse reactions occurring after any dose of IM injection of NVX-CoV2373 were i njection site tenderness , injection site pain, injection site swelling, and injection site redness . Local adverse reactions were usually mild to moder ate in severity with a median duration of less than or equal to 2 days. Systemic reactions : The most frequent systemic adverse reactions occurring after any dose of NVX- CoV2373 were headache, myalgia, fatigue, malaise, nausea or vomiting, arthralgia, and pyrexia. Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity with a median duration of less than or equal to 1 day for systemic events following vaccination. Homologous boosting vaccination Following homologous boosting vaccination in study 2019nCoV-101 ( Part 2), the most frequent solicited adverse reactions were injection site tenderness, fatigue, injection site pain, muscle pain, malaise , headache, joint pain, and fever with a median duration of 1 to 3 days following vaccination. Solicited adverse reacti ons were not assessed after homologous boosting vaccination in study 2019nCoV-501. Aspects of the formulation Adjuvant : NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix -M adjuvant is currently being evaluated in 5 ongoing clinical trials. To supplement the lack of available long- term safety data ( 6 months) in the ongoing clinical trials of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix -M adjuvant, an integrated analysis of safety was performed in 2,574 adult participants 18 years of age and older across 5 Novavax -sponsored clinical trials (EBOV -H-101, nanoparticle vaccine antigens using the same manufacturing platform technology as NVX-CoV2373 administe red with the same Matrix -M adjuvant with safety follow-up ranging from 6 months to 1 year. For this integrated analysis, short- term safety data (solicited local and systemic treatment emergent adverse events [TEAEs ] and unsolicited TEAEs) were summarised for each individual study and long- term safety data ( serious adverse events [ SAEs ] and AESIs) were pooled across the clinical trials. The safety of other recombinant nanoparticle vaccine antigens with Matrix -M adjuvant showed that each antigen and adjuvant regimen was acceptably well tolerated and resulted in safety profiles similar to those seen in the clinical trials of NVX-CoV2373 with Matrix -M adjuvant. In general, frequencies of solicited local and systemic TEAEs were increased in recipients who received Matrix -M-adjuvanted vaccines (compared to those who received vaccines without Matrix -M adjuvant) and in recipients who received two -dose regimens of Matrix-M- adjuvanted vaccine (compared to those who received one- dose regimens of Matrix-M-adjuvant ed vaccine). Severe solicited TEAEs were reported in less than 10% of participants across the two- dose Matrix -M-adjuvanted vaccine groups and in less than 5% of participants across the one- dose Matrix -M-adjuvanted vaccine groups. Frequencies of unsolicited TEAEs were generally similar between the treatment groups and occurred in less than 10% of participants in 4 studies and in less than 30% of participants in Study RSV-E-205. Pooled s afety analyses of SAE and AESI data across the 5 trials showed no increas ed risks between the treatment groups across the two age strata evaluated (18 to 64 years and 65 years). Approximately 0.5% of participants in the Matrix-M- adjuvanted vaccine and active influenza comparator groups died, which was lower than the percentage of death (1.4%) in the placebo group. NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 35 All deaths occurred in participants 65 years and none of the deaths were assessed as related to treatment. In participants 18 to 64 years of age, frequencies of other SAEs occurred at similar exposure- adjusted rates across the Matrix -M-adjuvanted vaccine (9.3 events per 100 subject years [SY]), Matrix -M-unadjuvanted vaccine (10.4 events per 100 SY), and active influenza vaccine comparator (13.1 events per 100 SY) groups, all of which had higher exposure- adjusted rates than placebo (0 events per 100 SY). Two SAEs (pericarditis and convulsion) were assessed by the investigator as related to study treatment, both of which occurred in the Without Matrix-M-adjuvanted vaccine group . In participants 65 years of age, frequencies of other SAEs also occurred at similar exposure adjusted rates across the Any Dose Matrix -M-adjuvanted vaccine (12.6 events per 100 SY), Without Matrix -M-adjuvanted vaccine (11.6 events per 100 SY), and Active Influenza Vaccine Comparator (9.8 events per 100 SY) groups, all of which had lower exposure- adjusted rates than Placebo (17.7 events per 100 SY). There were 4 SAEs (all seizure) reported as potential immune - mediated medical conditions ( PIMMCs) , with 2 events each occurring in each age strata. In participants 18 to 64 years of age, both seizure events (2.1 events per 100 SY) were reported in the Without Matrix -M-adjuvanted vaccine group; in participants 65 years of age, both seizure events were reported in the 50 g Matrix-M-adjuvanted vaccine group. All events occurred in participants with a prior history of seizure and/or additional risk factors for seizure occurrence. In conclusion, both short- and long-term safety data from other recombinant nanoparticle vaccine antigen s with Matrix -M adjuvant were acceptably well tolerated in healthy and medically stable participants 18 years of age and older. In the short- term, these safety profiles appear similar to those seen across clinical trials with SARS -CoV-2 rS with Matrix -M adjuvant. In the long- term, no increased risk was associated with any of the recombinant nanoparticle vaccine antigens with Matrix - M adjuvant supporting a favorable long- term safety profile of SARS -CoV- 2 rS with Matrix -M adjuvant. It is concluded that the Matrix -M adjuvant does not pose any important safety concern. Adverse Events of Special Interest The Novavax l ist of AESI s is drawn from efforts by regulatory authorities, internationally recognis ed collaborations, and the scientific literature to identify AESIs for vaccinations, and COVID-19 vaccinations specifically . The list of AESI s is provided in Annex 7. Risk of vaccine drop out No specific treatment -related TEAEs led to study discontinuation in either the NVX-CoV2373 or placebo group. Vaccine discontinuation due to TEAEs was very low in t he NVX-CoV2373 group (n = 84 participants [0.3%]) in the pooled safety dataset (N = 30,058). This rate was similar to that in the placebo group (n = 43 participants [0.2%]) in the pooled safety dataset (N = 19,892). In pa ediatric participants 12 to < 18 years of age, there were no TEAEs reported in either the NVX - CoV2373 or placebo group that led to study discontinuation in the 2019nCoV-301 pa ediatric expansion study. Relevance of long -term follow -up Given the expedited nature of the NVX- CoV2373 clini cal development programme in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, understanding of the long- term safety profile of NVX -CoV2373 is NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 36 currently limited. Consequently, while there is no scientific evidence to suspect an adverse long- term safety profile, it is recognised that further follow-up for all vaccines developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is required. In the ongoing clinical studies, it is planned to follow all participants contributing to safety pool for up to 6 months (505), 1 year post- vaccination ( Studies 101 Part 1 and 2, 501, and 302) or 2 years post- vaccination ( Study 301). However, it is recognised that with the increasing availability of alternative authorised COVID-19 vaccines, individuals may seek to receive confirmation of their vaccination status, thereby requesting to be unblinded and thus limiting the ability to coll ect long -term placebo - controlled follow-up data for the entire study population in an unbiased fashion. Risks of vaccination errors in the context of mass vaccination campaigns As Nuvaxovid may be administered in large- scale vaccination programmes, there may be a potential for vaccination errors. Vaccination errors may relate to administration, vaccination scheme, storage conditions, or errors associated with multidose vials. These potential vaccination errors are mitigated through a number of strategies: SmPC s ection 6.6 contains instructions on administration and storage conditions for Nuvaxovid. Instructions on vaccination scheme are provided in SmPC s ection 4.2. Medical information c ontact centers are available for the public and HCPs to respond to medical information inquiries about Nuvaxovid. A website (www.NovavaxCovidVaccine.com) will be in place for more information. Vaccin ation reminder cards and stickers with batch/lot numbers will be available to member states, if requested, for use by member state vaccinators . Furthermore, as other COVID- 19 vaccines are also available, there is the potential for con fusion or interchangeability with other COVID- 19 vaccines. The above mechanisms are in place to facilitate safe use and avoidance of vaccination errors. SVII. 1.2. Risk s considered important for inclusion in the list of safety conce rns in the RMP Important Identified Risks Myocarditis and/or pericarditis Risk-benefit impact : Myocarditis and/or pericarditis are events which may be serious or non-serious and are generally mild but may be potentially lifethreatening. Balanced with the risk of death and illness (including myocarditis) seen with COVID -19 itself, the impact on the risk -benefit balance of the vaccine is considered minimal. NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 37 Important Potential Risk s Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Risk-benefit impact: T heoretically, vaccination against SARS -CoV- 2 may be associated with enhanced severity of COVID-19 episodes, which would manifest as VAED. VAERD refers to the predominantly lower respiratory tract presentation of VAED. Although available data have not identified VAED/VAERD as a concern for NVX-CoV2373, the risk of VAED/VAERD cannot be ruled out. VAED/VAERD may be serious or lif e-threatening , and requires early detection, careful monitoring, and timely medical intervention. Missing information Use in pregnan cy and while breastfeeding Risk-benefit impact: Pregnant and breastfeeding women are typically excluded from ini tial clinical trials. There is limited experience with use of NVX -CoV2373 in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post-natal development. Administration of Nuvaxovid in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. It is unknown whether Nuvaxovid is excreted in human milk. No effects on the breast -fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast -feeding woman to Nuvaxovid is negligible. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive to xicity. Use in immunocompromised patients Risk-benefit impact: Immunocompromised individuals are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality from vaccine- preventable disease. In addition, vaccines may be less effective in severely immunocompromised patients , as the vaccinees weakened immune system may not mount a sufficient response. Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving NVX-CoV2373 will be different to that of the general population, the possibility cannot be excluded. Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Risk-benefit impact: Frail (unstable) patients with comorbidities are at risk of developing a more severe manifestation of COVID-19. Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving NVX-CoV2373 will be different to that of the general population, the possibility cannot be excluded. Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Risk-benefit impact: There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. There is no evi dence from NVX -CoV2373 clinical studies to date that the safety profile of this population differs with that of the general population. However, given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 38 Interaction with other vaccines Risk-benefit imp act: The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of NVX -CoV2373 when co - administered with another vaccine ( i.e., with seasonal illness vaccines [such as the influenza vaccines]) was evaluated in approximately 400 persons in the UK Phase 3 study. The binding antibody response to SARS CoV-2 was lower when NVX-CoV2373 was given concomitantly with inactivated influenza vaccine. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Long -term safety Risk-benefit impact : Giv en the nature of the NVX -CoV2373 clinical development programme, understanding of the long- term safety profile of NVX-CoV2373 is currently limited. SVII.2 New s afety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an updated RMP The important potential risk of myocarditis and pericarditis was updated to myocarditis and/or pericarditis and reclassified to an important identified risk at the request of EMA on 26 July 2022 based on cumulative data from clinical and post-marketing adverse events reflective of myocarditis and/or pericarditis. SVII.3 Details of important identified risks, important potential risks , and missing information SVII.3.1. Presentation of important identified risks and important potential risks Important identified risks Table SVII.3.1.1: Myocarditis and/or pericarditis Important identified risk: Myocarditis and /or pericarditis Potential mec hanism(s) Myocarditis can be caused by a variety of infectious and non -infectious causes, with viruses being the most common pathogen. Other common causes include autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus. In the general population, the inc idence of myocarditis is approximately between 10 to 20 cases per 100,000 persons per year. According to some estimates, 1% to 5% of all patients with acute viral infections may involve the myocardium. The majority of patients are young, healthy males. Individuals who are most susceptible to myocarditis include children, pregnant women, and those who are immunocompromised ( Kang and An 2021). Myocarditis begins with the direct invasion of an infectious agent and its subsequent replication within or around the myocardium causing myonecrosis. The subacute phase is defined by an increase in autoimmune- mediated injury with activated T cells and B cells and subsequent antibody production creating cardiac autoantibodies along with inflammatory proteins ( Kang and An 2021 ). A mechanism of action by which a vaccine could cause myocarditis and/ or pericarditis has not been established. Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence Literature on COVID -19 vaccines, post -market safety data, and clinical trial data. NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 39 Important identified risk: Myocarditis and /or pericarditis Characterisation of risk Clinical trial experience Participants 12 years of age and older In the placebo- controlled safety dataset for NVX -CoV2373 (i.e., prior to blinded crossover), 30,058 subjects received active vaccine and 19,892 subjects received placebo. Two cases of myocarditis were reported following exposure to NVX -CoV2373 and one case was reported following exposure to placebo. The myocarditis/pericarditis exposure adjusted incidence rate per 100 person years (PY) of 0.03 events/100 PY for NVX- CoV2373 compared to 0.02 events/100 PY for placebo with an adjusted risk difference of 0.00 (95%: -0.06, 0.07). In the post -crossover phase of the studies 301 and 302, three cases of myocarditis were reported. The observed rate of 3 cases/14,513 PY falls within the expected rate of 1.6 -4.6 cases/14,513 PY as determined by the EU ACCESS study. Of note, the exposure adjusted incidence post -crossover is the same as the placebo incidence of 0.02 events/100 person years during the place bo-controlled period suggesting a stable background incidence rate. The Sponsor assessed the causality as not related for the five cases occurring after exposure to NVX -CoV2373; all cases were attributed to alternative aetiologies, including reasonable infectious and/or non- infectious causes. There were no cases of myocard itis/pericarditis assessed as related by the Sponsor. Review of data from the placebo -controlled data set of the 2019- nCoV -301 Paediatric Expansion study in participants 12 to <18 years of age demonstrated no cases of myocarditis or pericarditis. P ost-marketing experience A broad search strategy of post -marketing data using SMQ (broad) pericarditis used to ident ify reports of myocarditis and/or pericarditis. All reports retrieved by the broad search strategy were adjudicated against the Brighton Collaboration (BC) case definitions for myocarditis and pericarditis. Cases were reported in male and female adults. Most cases lack detailed medical information, including confounders and alternative etiology. Follow -up information is limited or unobtainable as most cases were received from Health Authorities. A disproportionate number of cases, 19 (67.0%), were reported from Australia, where active surveillance programs are in place, but information provided from the reporter in most cases was limited. Risk characteri sation will continue to be evaluated as post -marketing data is received. Risk factors and risk groups Adolescent and young adult males following the second dose of vaccine may be at higher risk ( Gargano 2021). Immunocompromised patients may be at a higher risk. Preventability Routine risk minimi sation measures in the form of product labelling are included in the EU SmPC. Impact on the risk -benefit balance of the product Balanced with the risk of death and illness (including myocarditis) seen with COVID - 19 itself, the vaccine has a favourable risk -benefit balance. Public health impact As this event is limited to the individual patient and cons idering the low rates of myocarditis and/or pericarditis reported following vaccination, balanced with the risk of death and illness (including myocarditis) caused by COVID -19, the public health impact is considered minimal. NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 40 Important potential risks Table SVII.3.1.2: Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine- associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Important potential risk: Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine -associated enhanced disease ( VAERD) Potential mechanism(s) The pathogenesis of VAED in the context of SARS -CoV -2 is unclear, and there are no consistent mechanisms or immune markers of disease enhancement from non- clinical studies. Although animal models of SARSCoV2 infection may elucidate mechanisms of immune protection, we need observations of enhanced disease in individuals who receive COVID -19 vaccines to understand the risk of immune enhancement of disease (Haynes 2020). VAERD refers to the predominantly lower respiratory tract presentation of VAED. The mechanism of the pathogenesis of VAERD may be specific to the lower respiratory tract or may be part of a systemic process. The vaccine induces a Th1- biased immune response, which is considered less likely to be associated with VAED. Less severe cases of SARS were associated with accelerated induction of a Th1 cell respons e; whereas, Th2 cell responses have been associated with enhancement of lung disease following infection in hosts parenterally vaccinated with inactivated SARS -CoV vaccines ( Lambert 2020). Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence Literature on viral vaccines, safety information of other SARS -CoV -2 vaccines, clinical trials. VAED has been rarely encountered with existing vaccines or viral infections. It was observed in children given formalin- inactivated whole -virus vaccines against RSV and measles virus ( Haynes 2020). No events of VAED/VAERD have been reported in the current NVX -CoV2373 clinical development programme. There is a theoretical concern that vaccination against SARS -CoV -2 may be associated with enhanced severity of COVID -19 episodes, which would manifest as VAED/VAERD 2021). Characteri sation of risk VAED/VAERD, if it would occur in vaccinated persons, would manifest as a modified and/or more severe clinical presentation of SARS -CoV -2 viral infection upon subsequent natural infection. This may result in individuals assumed to be at lower risk for severe COVID -19 having more severe disease, for individuals at known risk for severe COVID -19 (e.g., older or immunocompromised, immunocompromised children, and ch ildren with chronic conditions) having higher rates of fatal outcomes, or for observation of an unfavorable imbalance in severe COVID -19 cases in vaccinated individuals when compared to those not vaccinated. C linical trial experience Participants 18 years of age and older No events of VAED/VAERD have been reported in adult part icipants in the current NVX- CoV2373 clinical development programme and in fact the vaccine has been shown to prevent severe illness. VAED/VAERD has not been repo rted in other COVID- 19 vaccines at this moment. Participants 12 to < 18 years of age Data from 2019 -nCoV -301 P aediatric Expansion study in pa ediatric participants 12 to <18 years of age demonstrated no cases of VAED/VAERD . P ost-marketing experience As of 31July 2022, t here were no cases reported of VAED (including VAE RD) according to the prescribed search strategy ( PTs: Vaccine- associated enhanced disease; Vaccine- associated respiratory disease) . Risk factors and risk groups There are no known risk factors or specific risk populations identified for VAED/VAERD. The demonstration of some disease enhancement with any candidate vaccine after viral challenge in animal models should not necessarily represent a no- go signal for deciding whether to progress into early trials in clinical development of a COVID- 19 vaccine ( Lambert 2020 ). Population -based surveillance might give more insig ht in this, should any VAED occur. NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 41 Important potential risk: Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory disease ( VAERD) Preventability Prevention of VAED/VAERD in the context of SARS -COV -2 is currently unknown. Population- based surveillance might give more insight in this, should any VAED occur. Impact on the risk -benefit balance of the product Vaccine -associated enhanced disease (including VAERD) may present as severe disease or modified/unusual clinical manifestations of a known disease presentation and may involve one or multiple organ systems. Subjects with VAED/VAERD may experience r apid clinical deterioration and will likely require non -invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation; and patients diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have poorer prognosis and potentially higher mortality rate. However, as no cases have been reported at the moment, there is no impact on the benefit -risk balance. Public health impact As this safety concern is currently theoretical and has not been observed in the completed/ongoing trials in relation to NVX- CoV2373 administration, there is no public health impact at this time. SVII.3.2. Presentation of the missing i nformation Table SVII.3.2.1: Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding Evidence Source There is limited experience with use of NVX -CoV2373 in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post-natal development. Administration of Nuvaxovid in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. It is unknown whether Nuvaxovid is excreted in human milk. No effe cts on the breast -fed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breast -feeding woman to Nuvaxovid is negligible. Population in need of further characterisation Pregnant and breastfeeding women. Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information Targeted populations of the indication will include women of childbearing potential, thus, vaccination of pregnant and/or breastfeeding women will occur. Table SVII.3.2.2: Use in immunocompromised patients Evidence Source The vaccine has not been studied in individuals with immunocompromised conditions, except for subjects with HIV. Subjects with HIV were not excluded from the clinical programme, and 244 participants were enrolled in the 2019nCoV -501 study. The safety profile of NVX -CoV2373 in HIV -positive participants in this study was similar to that seen in HIV -negative participants. There is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving NVX -CoV2373 will be different to that of the general population, but given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. Population in need of further characterisation Individuals with compromised immune function due to acquired or genetic conditions or conditions requiring the use of immunosuppressants. Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information Vaccines may be less effective in severely immunocompromised patients, as the vaccinees weakened immune system may not mount a sufficient response. NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 42 T able SVII.3.2.3: Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Evidence Source The vaccine has not been studied in frail (unstable) individuals w ith severe comorbidities that may compromise immune function due to the condition or treatment of the condition. Frail patients with comorbidities (e.g., COPD, DM, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) are potentially at risk of developing a more severe manifestation of COVID -19. There is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving NVX -CoV2373 will be different to that of the general population, but given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. Population in need of further characterisation Frail individuals with comorbidities (e.g., COPD, DM, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders). Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information Frail individuals with unstable and/or se vere health conditions and comorbidities may experience a different outcome of the vaccination than that achieved in generally healthy individuals administered vaccines. Table SVII.3.2.4: Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Evidence Source There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. There is no evidence from NVX- CoV2373 clinical studies to date that the safety profile of this population differs with that of the general population. However, given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. Population in need of further characterisation Patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders. Anticipated risk /consequence of the missing information Individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders may experience a different outcome than achieved in healthy individuals administered vaccines. Table SVII.3.2.5: Interaction with other vaccines Evidence Source There is limited information on the safety of the vaccine when administered with other vaccines within 28 days prior to the first dose or any dose of NVX -CoV2373, except for seasonal influenza vaccine, < 14 days. Approximately 400 participants were concomitantly administered a seasonal influenza vaccine with NVX -CoV2373 or placebo. The binding antibody response to SARS -CoV -2 was lower when NVX- CoV2373 was given concomitantly w ith inactivated influenza vaccine. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Population in need of further characterisation Individuals who will receive other vaccines within 28 days prior to or 14 days after immunisation with NVX -CoV2373/Nuvaxovid. Anticipated risk/consequence of the missing information Theoretically, vaccines may interact with each other and change the immune response to either vaccine or induce safety concerns. NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 43 T able SVII.3.2.6: Long -term safety Evidence Source Understanding of the long -term safety profile of NVX -CoV2373 is currently limited.

Routine PV activities for the lifecycle of a product are critical components to the detection, assessment, and understanding of risks. Activities include the collection, processing and analysis of individual case safety reports , the review and reporting on aggregate data, and a signal detection system. A comp rehensive description of all aspects of the PV system is provided in the Pharmacovigilance System Master File (PSMF), which is available upon request. Novavax monitors the safety profile of its products, evaluates issues potentially impacting product benef it-risk profiles in a timely manner, and ensures that appropriate communication of relevant safety information is conveyed in a timely manner to regulatory authorities, other interested parties as appropriate, and in accordance with international principles and prevailing regulations. NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 44 Signal detection activities The detection of signals described in the N ovavax Pharmacovigilance Signaling System (PvSS) plan involves qualitative and quantitative pharmacovigilance methods. The primary data sources for signal detection and the minimum frequency of review are outlined below. Activity/Data Source Frequency of Review Qualitative Data Review ICSR (Individual Case Safety Report) medical review of serious cases Each business day Review of signal notifications Each business day Literature review of EMBASE including Medline Weekly Line listing review of adverse event reports from the safety database Weekly Batch trend analysis Monthly Review of Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee ( PRAC ) recommendations on signals ** Monthly Quantitative Data Review Review of all cumulative data contained in Novavax's post -authorisation Safety Database, including all spontaneous and solicited ICSRs, Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), Eudra Vigilance Data Analysis System (EVDAS), and other regulatory databases, as required * * Weekly Review of cumulative SMQ (MedDRA [Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities] queries) and targeted PT queries Weekly Review data mining results for the US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)* Bi-weekly Review data mi ning results for the EVDAS Electronic Monitoring (eRMR) system* ** Bi-weekly Aggregate review of Novavax's Clinical Trial Database Monthly Trends over time/frequency analysis Weekly Observed versus expected (O/E) analysis Monthly *Applicable once Novavax post -authorisation database reaches a threshold number of ICSRs. ** Applicable once product is authori sed in the EU. Summary S afety R eports ( SSRs) SSRs have been implemented for the pandemic setting. SSRs are currently submitted mo nthly; however, the need for and frequency of submission of SSR s will be re -evaluated based on post- authorisation experience after 6 months. The topics covered in SSR s include: Interval and cumulative number of reports overall and stratified by age groups, report type (medically confirmed vs. non-medically confirmed), seriousness, and in special populations(e.g., pregnant women) Interval and cumulative number of reports per HLT and SOC Reports per EU country Exposure data based on administered doses rather than distributed doses whenever possible,stratified by region (and within the EU also by country), by age groups, gender, by dosenumber (when applicable)NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 45 Safety -related changes to the reference safety information and actions taken in the interval for safety reasons List of o ngoing and closed validated signals in the interval, including a summary of their evaluation; reviews of signals identified during the period or of safety topics identified by EMA and requested to be addressed in the SSR Summaries of reported cases of all AESIs and RMP safety concerns : report numbers and cases, including cumulative O/E analysis (when possible) Discussion of an unusual pattern of f atal reports , if observed including numbers and relevant cases (considering co- morbidities and frailty ), including O/E analyses (when possible), stratified by age groups. Medication errors, if a pattern of errors leading to harm is identified and/or risk minimisationactivities are considered warranted Details of the search strategy, case definitions , and methodology for O/E analyses including source of background rates, risk windows, etc., as needed Risk/benefit considerations Traceability To facilitate the traceability of the use of this vaccine, the SmPC includes instructions for HCP s to record the name and batch number of the administered vaccine for each recipient. Traceability is available for every shipping container of COVID-19 vacci ne, which are outfitted with a unique device that provides real-time monitoring of geographic location and records temperature 24 hours per day, 7 days per week while in transit. Each device will also trace the batch/lot of the associated shipment. The device is activated prior to shipment and information is transmitted wirelessly to Novavax at a predefined cadence, until delivery to the customer. A shipment quality report that indicates if the product is acceptable for immediate use is generated by Novavax and transmitted to the vaccinator's practice site upon pressing of the stop button on the data logger, or arrival notification from the carrier in combination with the data logger 's location and/or light signal. Additionally, alarms and escalation/notific ation for excursions (per pre- defined specifications) are programmed into the device. The carton, which is the lowest saleable unit of the product, contains the product global trade identification number (GTIN), lot/batch number, and expiry date printed a s human readable information and a scannable GS1 1D Data Matrix code . Further, vaccination reminder cards will be available ( Annex 7) to member states, if requested, for use by member state vaccinators at the time of vaccination. The vaccination reminder cards contain the following elements: Placeholder space for the vaccinee name; Placeholder space for the name of the vaccine (brand name) and manufacturer of the vaccine; Placeholder space for the batch /lot number of the vaccine; Placeholder space for the date the vaccine was administered; A reminder to return for the second or other doses of the vaccine;NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 46 Placeholder spaces for the second do se of the vaccine including the name of the vaccine/manufacturer of the vaccine, batch number, and date of the second dose of the vaccine; Placeholder space for a third /\"other\" dose of the vaccine; Novavax website and QR code that links to NovavaxCovidVacc ine.com ; and Information on AE reporting to the member state local health authorities . In addition to the vaccination reminder cards, traceability labels ( two labels per dose) containing product identifier (brand name) and batch/lot information as human readable and GTIN, batch/lot information and expiration date encoded in GS-1 compliant 2- D data matrix will be made available to support documentation of the batch/lot traceability on the vaccination reminder card and for us e in the vaccinee's medical records. We also acknowledge that some EU member states may require utilisation of nationally mandated vaccination cards or electronic systems to document batch/lot number; therefore, the available traceability and vaccination r eminder cards and/or stickers with printed lot/batch information may not be utilised in all member states. Routine PV activities beyond AE reporting and signal detection: Specific adverse reaction follow-up forms for the following safety concerns : Vaccine- associated enhanced disease (VAED) , including vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory disease ( VAERD) Myocarditis/pericarditis Please find examples of these questionnaires in Annex 4. III.2 Additional Pharmacovigilance A ctivities Continuation of safety surveillance from ongoing clinical trials is a priority and included as an additional PV activity, as ongoing data collection in these studies is also anticipated to provide further data to characteri se the NVX -CoV2373 safety profile. These studies are not considered post- authorisation safety studies (PASS); however, they are included in this RMP as additional PV activities in accordance with COVID -19 RMP- specific regulatory guidance.

Page 67 SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR NUV AXOVID (COVID- 19 V ACCINE (RECOMBINANT, ADJUV ANT ED)) This is a summary of the RMP for Nuvaxovid. The R MP details important risks of Nuvaxovid, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about Nuvaxovid's risks and uncertainties (missing information). Nuvaxovid's SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to HCP s and patients on how Nuvaxovid should be used. This summary of the RMP for Nuvaxovid should be read in the context of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of the Nuvaxovid RMP. I. The medicine and what it is used for Nuvaxovid is authorised for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 12 years of age and older (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains SARS -CoV-2 spike protein and is adjuvant ed with Matrix -M as the active substance and it is given by intramuscular (IM) injection . Further information about the evaluation of Nuvaxovid's benefits can be found in Nuvaxovid's EPAR, including in its plain -language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine's webpage https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/nuvaxovid. II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the risk s Important risks of Nuvaxovid, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies for learni ng more about Nuvaxovid risks, are outlined below. Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and HCP s; Important advice on the medicine's packaging; The authorised pack size \u2014 the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the medicine is used correctly; The medicine' s legal status \u2014 the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and regular ly analys ed, including PSUR assessment and monthly Summary Safety Reports so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine PV activities. NVX -CoV2373 Risk Management Plan Novavax, Inc. Page 68 If important information that may affect the safe use of Nuvaxovid is not yet available, it is listed under 'missing information' below. II.A List of important risks and missing information Important risks of Nuvaxovid are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient pr oof of a link with the use of Nuvaxovid. P otential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missi ng information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine) . List of important risks and missing information Important identified risks Myocarditis and/or pericarditis Important potential risks Vaccine- associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine- associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Missing information Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding Use in immunocompromised patients Use in frail patients with comorbidities (e.g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , diabetes, chronic neurological disease, cardiovascular disorders) Use in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory disorders Interaction with other vaccines Long- term safety II.B Summary of important risks Important identified risk : Myocarditis and/or pericarditis Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine L iterature on COVID -19 vaccines, post -market safety data, and clinical trial data.

Page 70 Important potential risk: Vacci ne-associated enhanced disease (VAED), including vaccine -associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine L iterature on viral vaccines, safety information of other COVID- 19 vaccines, clinical trials. Vaccine- associated enhanced disease (VAED) has been rarely encountered with existing vaccines or viral infections. It was observed in children given formalin-inactivated whole -virus vaccines against RSV and measles virus. No events of VAED/VAERD have been reported in the current N uvaxovid clinical development programme. There is a theoretical concern that vaccination against SARS -CoV -2 may be associated with enhanced severity of COVID -19 episodes which would manifest as VAED/V AERD. Risk factors and risk groups T here are no known risk factors or specific risk populations identified for VAED/VAERD. The demonstration of some disease enhancement with any candidate vaccine after viral challenge in animal models should not necessar ily represent a no -go signal for deciding whether to progress into early trials in clinical development of a COVID -19 vaccine ( Lambert 2020 ). Populatio n-based surveillance might give more insight in this, should any VAED occur.

Page 71 Important missing information: Use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding Evidence for linking the risk to the medicine There is limited experience with use of Nuvaxovid in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to pregnancy, embryo/foetal development, parturition, or post -natal development. Administration of Nuvaxovid in pregnancy should only be considered when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and foetus. Breastfeeding It is unknown whether Nuvaxovid is excreted in human milk. Fertility Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity.

Page 78 Study: 2019nCoV-402 ( UK Post -Authorisation Safety Study Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Purpose of the study: To evaluate whether there is an increased risk of select safety outcomes of interest following vaccination with the Nuvaxovid using a (i) a self-controlled case series (SCCS) design and (ii) a comparative cohort study design. Study: 2019nCoV-405 (Global Pregnancy and Infant Outcomes Study Using the COVID-19 Vaccines International Pregnancy Exposure Registry (C -VIPER) ) Purpose of the study: To estimate the risk of obstetric outcomes and infant outcomes among pregnant women exposed to a single (homologous) or mixed (heterologous) Nuvaxovid series from 30 days prior to the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) to end of pregnancy and their offspring relative to a matched reference group who received no COVID-19 vaccinees during pregnancy. Study: 2019nCoV-404 ( US Post -authorisation safety study using a claims and/or EHR database) Purpose of the study: To evaluate the risk of select AESIs following vaccination with at least one dose of the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine using SCCS and cohort study designs. Study: 2019- nCoV-401 ( EU Post -Authorisation Effectiveness Study Based on a Test -Negative Design Using the COVIDRIVE Platf orm) Purpose of the study: To estimate COVID -19 vaccine effectiveness (CVE) of Nuvaxovid against hospitalisation due to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) patients who have completed their primary vaccination serie s, compared to unvaccinated patients. Additionally, the study will estimate CVE of Nuvaxovid against hospitalisation due to laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV- 2 in SARI patients who previously completed at least a primary series with any COVID-19 vaccine compar ed to a) unvaccinated patients and b) patients who previously completed at least a primary series with any COVID -19 vaccine but did not receive the last additional dose. Further, the study will estimate CVE across brands against hospitalisation due to laboratory -confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in SARI patients who previously completed at least a primary series with any COVID-19 vaccine but who did not receive the last additional dose, compared to unvaccinated patients. Study: 2019nCoV-403 ( US Post -authorisation Effectiveness Study Using a Claims and/or EHR Database) Purpose of the study: To estimate the effectiveness of Nuvaxovid in preventing COVID-19 hospitalisations compared to unvaccinated individuals.
