Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2023 | 17Progress in sustainability In the first quarter of 2023, Valmet continued to systematically implement its Sustainability360\u00b0 Agenda. As part of its annual reporting for 2022, Valmet reported on the progress of its sustainability performance in 2022. Environment During the first quarter of 2023, Valmet saw steady progress in the overall implementation of its Climate Program. Valmet continued to actively foster the participation in its comprehensive climate program related e-learnings and the topic was also chosen as the main theme for Valmet's global customer event in March 2023. On March 25, Valmet joined in promoting the WWF Earth Hour to raise awareness on climate change. Implementation of Beyond Circularity, the Valmet-lead R&D program and ecosystem to accelerate green transition, continued in 2023. Since its establishment in the early 2022, the program has progressed at full speed with six out the seven program streams and a multitude of internal and ecosystem projects ongoing. Social During the first quarter of 2023, Valmet ran the annual salary planning process with new color-coded recommendations to guide managers to allocate increases for high performers, especially those in the low end of the pay range. Valmet also organized local diversity and inclusion activities including participating in 'Introduce a girl to engineering' in Sweden and activities to recognize 'Women's month' in South America. Global Forward for Managers trainings continued with the target to have all Valmet line managers complete the training by the end of the year. At the end of March 2023, the lost time incident frequency rate (LTIF) for Valmet's own employees was 1.5 (1.8). As part of its efforts to improve safety, Valmet continued with working at height injury prevention actions and launched e-learnings for all minimum safety standards. Following the expansion of Valmet's global social responsibility program in the end of 2022, the implementation of local projects continued according to plan in early 2023.

Valmet is also a plaintiff in several lawsuits. Valmet's management does not expect to the best of its present understanding that the outcome of these lawsuits, claims and disputes will have a material adverse effect on Valmet in view of the grounds currently presented for them, provisions made, insurance coverage in force and the extent of Valmet's total business activities. Corporate Governance Statement and Remuneration Report Valmet has published a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for 2022, which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listed companies.

The authorizations shall remain in force until the close of the next Annual General Meeting, and they cancel the authorizations granted by the Annual General Meeting of March 22, 2022. As at March 31, 2023 , Valmet's Board of Directors had not used any authorizations given by the Annual General Meeting 2023. Share-based incentive plans Valmet's share-based incentive plans are part of the total compensation offered for Valmet's key personnel. The aim of the plans is to align the interests of the shareholders and the key employees to increase the value of Valmet in the long run, to steer the key employees towards achieving the Company's selected strategic targets, to commit the key employees to the Company, and to offer them a competitive reward plan based on holding the Company's shares. Any shares to be potentially awarded are, or have been, acquired through public trading, and therefore the incentive plans have no diluting effect on the share value. Long-term incentive plans - Performance Share Plan and Deferred Share Plan In its meeting on December 17, 2020, the Board of Directors of Valmet Oyj decided on new share-based long-term incentive plans, a Performance Share Plan and a Deferred Share Plan, for Valmet's key employees. The Board of Directors decides on a continuation of its share- based long-term incentive plans each year. The Performance Share Plan is directed to the Executive Team members.

Valmet's Board of Directors decides on the predefined performance measures and targets in the beginning of each performance period. The Deferred Share Plan is directed to other key employees in management positions, and management talents. It includes a one-year performance period. The predefined performance measures and targets are decided by Valmet's Board of Directors and are aligned with the targets of the Performance Share Plan. The Deferred Share Plan is directed to a maximum of 130 participants, of which approximately 80 are key employees in management positions, and approximately 50 are management talents.

The Board decided to initiate a fixed-term share buy-back program to acquire Valmet's own shares. The shares were acquired to meet part of the obligations arising from Valmet's share-based long-term incentive plans and the restricted pool incentive. The share acquisitions began on February 6, 2023, and ended on February 16, 2023. The number of shares acquired totaled 125,000. Based on the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting 2022, Valmet's Board of Directors decided in December 2022 on a directed share issue related to the reward payment of Valmet's share-based long-term incentive plans for the performance period 2022. In the share issue on March 15, 2023, a total of 91,646 Valmet's treasury shares were conveyed without consideration to the participants of the plans, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the plans. At the end of the reporting period, the Company held 379,285 treasury shares related to the share-based incentive programs. More information about share-based incentive plans can be found in Valmet's Remuneration Report, which is available at www.valmet.com/governance . Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2023 | 23Resolutions of Valmet's Annual General Meeting The Annual General Meeting 2023 was held in Helsinki on March 22, 2023. The Annual General Meeting adopted the Financial Statements for 2022 and discharged the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability for the financial year 2022. The Annual General Meeting adopted the remuneration report for governing bodies. The decision is advisory. The Annual General Meeting approved the Board of Directors' proposals concerning authorizing the Board of Directors to decide on repurchasing the Company's own shares and to decide on the issuance of shares and the issuance of special rights entitling to shares. The Annual General Meeting decided to pay dividends of EUR 1.30 per share for the financial period ended on December 31, 2022. The Annual General Meeting confirmed the number of Board members as eight and reappointed Mikael M\u00e4kinen as Chairman of Valmet S\u00f6derstr\u00f6m will continue as members of the Board. The term of office of the members of the Board of Directors expires at the close of the Annual General Meeting 2024. PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy was re-elected as the Company's auditor for a term expiring at the end of the next Annual General Meeting. Valmet published a stock exchange release on March 22, 2023, concerning the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting and the organizing meeting of the Board of Directors. The stock exchange release and meeting materials can be viewed on Valmet's website at www.valmet.com/investors/governance/annual-general-meeting . Risks and business uncertainties Valmet's operations are affected by various strategic, financial, operational and hazard risks. Valmet takes measures to exploit emerging opportunities and to limit the adverse effects of potential threats. The assessment of risks related to sustainable development holds an important role in risk management. If such threats materialized, they could have material adverse effects on Valmet's business, financial situation and operating result, or on the value of shares and other securities. The objective of Valmet's risk management is to ensure the implementation of an effective and successful strategy for achieving both long- and short-term goals. The task of Valmet's management is to regulate risk appetite. In assessing risks, Valmet takes into consideration the probability of the risks and their estimated impact on net sales or financial results. Valmet's management estimates that the Company's overall risk level is currently manageable in proportion to the scope of its operations and the practical measures available for managing these risks. Financial uncertainty in the global economy, coupled with fluctuations in exchange rates and tightening financial market regulations may have an adverse effect on the availability of financing from banks and capital markets and could reduce the investment appetite of Valmet's customers. Valmet estimates that the high proportion of business derived from stable business (Services and Automation segments) and the geographical diversification will reduce the possible negative effects that market uncertainties may have. Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2023 | 24If global economic growth weakens, it might have adverse effects on new projects under negotiation or on projects in the order backlog. Some projects may be postponed, suspended, or canceled. In the case of long-term delivery projects, initial customer advance payments are typically 10-30 percent of the value of the project, and customers make progress payments as the project is implemented. This significantly decreases the risks and financing requirements related to Valmet's projects. Valmet continually assesses its customers' creditworthiness and their ability to meet their obligations. As a rule, Valmet does not finance customer projects. If economic growth slows down significantly, the markets for Valmet's products may shrink, which may lead to, for example, tougher price competition. Increasing geopolitical tensions, increase of protectionist and more political regulation, and sanctions may create uncertainty to customers' investment activity and impact Valmet's operations. Changes and uncertainty in future regulation and legislation can have effects, especially on the energy business and the use of data. Large fluctuations in energy prices can affect the global economy. These fluctuations can also affect Valmet and its customers. Should the global issues with component availability and logistics continue, it could have adverse effects on Valmet's business. Changes in labor costs and the prices of raw materials and components can affect Valmet's profitability. Raw material and component cost inflation has been high, and wage inflation is expected to increase. Valmet's goal is to offset this through increased productivity and price increases. It is possible, however, that tough competition in some product categories will make it difficult to pass on cost increases to product prices. On the other hand, some of Valmet's customers are raw material producers and their ability to operate and invest may be enhanced by strengthening commodity prices and hampered by declining commodity prices. There may be changes in the competitive situation of Valmet's individual businesses, such as the emergence of new, cost-effective competition in the markets. Valmet can safeguard its market position by developing its products and services, and through good customer service and local presence. To ensure a high level of quality in both production and services, it is important to sustain a high level of competence and talent availability. This includes, for example, maintaining efficient recruitment programs, utilization of existing talent and sharing knowledge globally. Through acquisitions, Valmet may become exposed to risks associated with new markets and business environments. The actual acquisition process also includes risks. Other risks associated with acquisitions include, but are not limited to, integration of the acquired business, increased financial risk exposure, retention of key personnel and achieving the targets set for the acquired business. Valmet's operations, products and services rely largely on data networks, software and digital solutions. Any malfunctions and cybersecurity breaches in such networks, software and solutions as well as potential failures in information system development projects may adversely affect Valmet's business and financial position and lead to reputational damage. Management of project business risks important An important part of Valmet's business consists of project business. Pulp business projects in particular can be large, thus project-specific risk management is crucial. Key risks related to Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2023 | 25projects are project cost estimation, scheduling, project risk management, quality and performance risks, and materials management risks. Risk analysis shall, as a minimum, take place for all significant project quotations. The work concerning threat and opportunity assessment continues during the execution phase of the project. Risk management is based on careful planning and continuous, systematic monitoring and evaluation. Project risks are managed by improving and continuously developing project management processes and the related systems. Availability of financing crucial Securing the continuity of Valmet's operations requires sufficient available funding under all circumstances. Valmet estimates that its liquid cash assets and committed credit limits are sufficient to secure its immediate liquidity and to ensure the flexibility of financing. The average maturity of Valmet's non-current debt, excluding lease liabilities, is 3.1 years . Loan facilities include customary covenants, and Valmet is in clear compliance with the covenants at the balance sheet date. Net working capital and capital expenditure levels have a key impact on the adequacy of Valmet's financing. Setting aside investments into the renewal of the ERP system, Valmet does not expect any significant increase in annual capital expenditure and estimates that it is well-positioned to keep capital expenditure approximately at the level of total depreciation. Of the financial risks that affect Valmet's profit, currency exchange rate risks are among the most substantial. Exchange rate changes can affect Valmet's business, although the wide geographical scope of the Company's operations reduces the impact of any individual currency. Economic insecurity typically increases exchange rate fluctuations. Valmet hedges its currency exposures linked to firm delivery and purchase agreements. Changes in legislation and the way authorities interpret regulation, for example regarding taxation, can also have an impact on Valmet's financials. As at March 31, 2023 , Valmet had EUR 1,611 million (EUR 739 million ) of goodwill on its statement of financial position. Valmet assesses the carrying value of its goodwill for impairment annually, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that carrying value may not be recoverable. Valmet has not identified any indications of impairment during the reporting period. The principles used for impairment testing are presented in the financial statements. Should the crisis in the banking sector escalate, Valmet and its customers may be adversely impacted. Valmet has a strong balance sheet and liquidity. In order to diversify and mitigate the financial credit risk, funds are held with several financially-sound banks. Valmet is carefully evaluating counterparty risk and selecting only counterpart ies with high creditworthiness . Valmet's project business is typically cash positive, as the customers pay us advance and progress payments. Around half of Valmet's business consists of Services and Automation, where single orders are small. Furthermore, Valmet has hundreds of customers around the globe, which gives us natural hedge. Many of our customers are in strong financial shape. COVID-19 and potential other pandemic s Epidemic outbreaks and potential other pandemics remain a risk to Valmet's operations also after COVID-19. Pandemics might have impact on customers' investment activity, the supply chain and business operations by increasing the likelihood of interruptions. Valmet's Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2023 | 26operations are dispersed all around the world, Valmet has a global customer base and our suppliers operate in several countries. This mitigates the overall impacts of risks to Valmet, should there be any disruptions in some isolated country or case. Russia's invasion of Ukraine Russia's invasion of Ukraine causes significant risks and uncertainties to the markets affecting the entire global economic environment and financial markets. If the war is further prolonged or geopolitical tensions further increase, there could be additional adverse impacts on Valmet's operations, customer investment activity, project deliveries, availability and prices of components, supply chain and availability of financing for both Valmet and its customers. Valmet has an Incident Management Team (IMT) to monitor the situation and manage the Company's response to the impacts of the war. Events after the reporting period There have been no subsequent events after the review period that required recognition or disclosure. Guidance for 2023 Valmet estimates that net sales in 2023 will increase in comparison with 2022 (EUR 5,074 million) and Comparable EBITA in 2023 will increase in comparison with 2022 (EUR 533 million). Market outlook General economic outlook according to IMF World economic outlook is uncertain again amid financial sector turmoil, high inflation, ongoing effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and three years of COVID. IMF's baseline forecast is for growth to fall from 3.4 percent in 2022 to 2.8 percent in 2023, before settling at 3.0 percent in 2024. Advanced economies are expected to see an especially pronounced growth slowdown, from 2.7 percent in 2022 to 1.3 percent in 2023. Inflation's return to target is unlikely before 2025. (IMF World Economic Outlook, April 2023) Short-term market outlook Valmet reiterates the good short-term market outlook for services, flow control, automation systems, energy, and board and paper, the good/satisfactory short-term market outlook for pulp, and the satisfactory short-term market outlook for tissue. The short-term market outlook is given for the next six months from the end of the reported period. It is based on customer activity (50%) and Valmet's capacity utilization (50%), and the scale is 'weak-satisfactory-good'.

January-March 2023 | 33Basis of preparation General information Valmet Oyj (the \"Company\" or \"parent company\") (together \"Valmet\", \"Valmet Group\" or the \"Group\") form a global developer and supplier of technologies, automation and services for the pulp, paper and energy industries. Valmet Oyj is domiciled in Helsinki, and its registered address is Keilasatama 5, 02150 Espoo, Finland. The Company's shares are listed on Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were approved for issue on April 26, 2023 . Basis of presentation These condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2023 , have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 - Interim financial reporting and in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the European Union. The financial information presented in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements has not been audited. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022 , which have been prepared in accordance with IFRS. Valmet Group has applied new standards and interpretations published by IASB that are effective for the first time for financial reporting periods commencing on January 1, 2023 . These standards and interpretations did not have a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group, or the presentation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes became effective as of January 1, 2023. The amendments narrow the scope for the initial recognition exception and require companies to recognize deferred tax on transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal amounts of taxable and deductible temporary differences. Amendments are applied to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. At the beginning of the earliest comparative period, January 1, 2022, deferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences related to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at that date, with the cumulative effect recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. Applying the amendments to IAS 12 resulted in cumulative effect of EUR -1.8 million recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as at January 1, 2022, and EUR 0.3 million expense recognized for changes in deferred taxes in 2022. Except for the above, the accounting policies applied in the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. In these condensed consolidated interim financial statements, the figures are presented in million euros subject to rounding, which may cause some rounding inaccuracies in aggregate column and row totals.Unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2023 | 34Key exchange rates Average rates Period-end combinations Acquisition of NovaTech Automation's Process Solutions business On January 3, 2023, Valmet has completed the acquisition of the U.S. based NovaTech Automation's Process Solutions business. The acquired business specializes in process control and optimization solutions for batch, continuous and hybrid processes. It serves customers mainly in process industries such as food and beverage, pharmaceuticals and chemical products. With a turnover of approximately USD 18 million in 2022 , it employs 76 people in the United States and the Benelux countries. The acquisition excludes NovaTech Automation's other divisions. The acquired business has been consolidated into the Group financials from the acquisition date onwards. The assumed accounting for the acquisition, including estimated purchase consideration, is based on provisional amounts and the associated purchase accounting is not final. The acquisition of NovaTech Automation's Process Solutions business did not have a material impact on the results or financial position of Valmet, or its financial reporting for the three months ended March 31, 2023 .Unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements Valmet's Interim Review, January-March 2023 | 35Reportable segments and geographic information The Group's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the President and CEO of Valmet. Valmet has three operating segments and three reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Services, Automation and Process Technologies. Corporate functions are presented as Other. The Services segment provides customers with flexible and fit-for-purpose services throughout the lifecycle to improve process performance and reliability. The Automation segment delivers automation solutions ranging from single measurements to mill- or plant- wide process automation systems, and mission-critical flow control technologies and services for the process industries. The Process Technologies segment provides technology solutions for pulp and energy production, as well as for biomass conversion and emission control, and complete production lines, machine rebuilds and process components for board, tissue and paper production. The financial reporting structure reflects Valmet's operational model, and is aligned with the way the CODM evaluates the operational performance of the segments and allocates resources. One key indicator of performance reviewed by the CODM is Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA). Performance is also assessed through Comparable EBITA, i.e., with EBITA excluding certain items of income and expense that reduce the comparability of Valmet's performance from one period to another. The alternative performance measures of EBITA and Comparable EBITA are published by Valmet as part of regulated financial information to enable users of the financial information to prepare more meaningful analysis on Valmet's performance. Items affecting comparability consist of income and expenses arising from activities that amend the capacity of Valmet's operations, such as restructuring costs, and gains or losses on sale of businesses or non-current assets, and income and expenses incurred outside Valmet's normal course of business, such as impairment charges and income and expenses recorded as a result of settlement payments to/from third parties (e.g., penalties incurred as a result of tax audits or settlements to closed lawsuits) as well as income and expenses arising from changes in legislation expected to affect Valmet temporarily only (e.g., customs or other tariffs imposed by authorities on Valmet's products).

Paper, and Pulp and Energy business lines' revenue is derived from large long-term projects, for which revenue is mostly recognized over time based on the cost-to- cost method. Service business line's revenue arises from large volume of short-term contracts with relatively low individual value, for which revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time. Flow Control business line's valves equipment sales are recognized at a point in time. Automation business line's revenue consists of long-term contracts and short-term service contracts. The nature of long-term contracts, and therefore also the revenue recognition method, is similar to process technologies projects although with average contract values being lower. Revenue for short-term service contracts is recognized at a point in time. Nature of revenue in each area in any given reporting period is driven by volume and size of ongoing projects.

During the reporting period Valmet had not entered into any material contracts where the period between when Valmet transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or more. Neither were there any ongoing projects from previous reporting periods for which the former would apply. The creditworthiness of a customer is verified before entering into a contract. However, if a risk of non-payment arises after contract inception, the probability of collection of consideration is re-evaluated and if assessed improbable, recognition of revenue is discontinued. An allowance for non-collectability of open receivables and contract assets is established as concluded appropriate. Valmet receives payments from customers based on invoicing schedules as set out in the customer contracts. Changes in contract assets and liabilities are due to Valmet's performance under the contracts. Amounts due from customers under revenue contracts primarily relate to Valmet's right to consideration for work completed but not yet invoiced at the reporting date. These assets are transferred to trade receivables when right to consideration becomes unconditional, which is typically at the time when Valmet has contractual right to issue an invoice. Significant part of amounts due to customers relate to advance consideration received from customers in long-term capital contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These amounts are recognized as revenue as (or when) Valmet performs under the contracts. Following tables provide specification of movements in amounts due from customers under revenue contracts and amounts due to customers under revenue contracts over the reporting period. Revenue recognized in the period also includes revenue recognized related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods, the amount of which however is insignificant.
