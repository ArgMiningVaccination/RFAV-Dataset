Detoxing has so many health benefits. It can help you boost a sluggish metabolism, protect against diseases, sleep better at night, enjoy more energy during the day, and much more. With so many detox products on the market that claim to help you detox, it can be hard to know which ones to choose and which are a waste of your time (and money). What Are The Best Detoxifying Supplements? 1. Glutathione Glutathione is found in high levels in all cells. It has been shown to perform the following detox duties (1): - It directly neutralizes chemicals of superoxide radicals, hydroxyl radicals, and singlet oxygen - It assist with the regeneration of vitamins C and E - It acts as a cofactor for several antioxidant enzymes - It neutralizes free radicals that are made during phase I liver metabolism of toxins - It gets activated intermediates produced by phase I detoxification ready to be excreted by the kidneys by making them water soluble - It transports mercury out of the brain and cells - It regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis - It assists mitochondrial function and maintains mitochondrial DNA [SolFuel Clear ](https://solarispremium.com/products/solfuel-clear?_pos=1&_sid=1efd9003c&_ss=r)provides an excellent source of glutathione to help support your detox journey. It also contains several other ingredients that are proven detox helpers, such as green tea, B vitamins, milk thistle, antioxidants, and amino acids. 2. Magnesium Magnesium has laxative properties that help detox the body by moving toxins through the digestive tract and promoting regularity. However, there are several forms of magnesium on the market and some are better absorbed than others. Chelated magnesium is a highly bioavailable form of magnesium that ensures you'll absorb it and reap all of its benefits. The [SolFuel Clear Cleansing System ](https://solarispremium.com/products/solfuel-clear-cleansing-system-14-day-detox?_pos=1&_sid=2d11fdcfb&_ss=r)contains chelated magnesium, glutathione, as well as many other supplements found on this list for a complete detox system. 3. Milk Thistle Milk thistle is an herb that is one of the best detoxifying supplements sold in supplement form due to its ability to promote liver and gallbladder health by protecting against a variety of poisons. Research shows that milk thistle helps protect the liver through a number of methods, including via its antioxidant activity, by blocking toxins at the membrane level, and through enhancing protein synthesis(2). Milk thistle also has immune-boosting, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic properties to further protect the body (2). 4. Probiotics Taking a probiotic supplement is an excellent way to boost digestive health, which is necessary for the elimination of toxins. Probiotics are the \"good\" bacteria in your gut. Research shows that they help restore bowel flora and improve liver enzymes in people with alcohol-induced liver injury (3). They also have properties that help them bind to toxins from food and water and move them out of the body (4). [SolPro ](https://solarispremium.com/products/solpro?_pos=2&_sid=ac0ba66d4&_ss=r)capsules contain 20 billion CFUs of the highest-quality probiotics from seven different strains to help support healthy gut flora and regularity. For more probiotic power, try taking [ SolPro in packet form](https://solarispremium.com/products/solpro-225?_pos=1&_sid=ac0ba66d4&_ss=r). One packet contains 225 billion CFUs from six different strains. 5. L-Glutamine L-glutamine is an amino acid that helps protect against intestinal diseases. It's included on our list of the best detoxifying supplements because it helps suppress pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, regulates tight junction proteins to prevent leaky gut syndrome, and protects cells against stressors (5). L-glutamine also aids in the detoxification of ammonia and systemic acid-base balance, and helps restore the function and structure of the liver (6). [SolGI Integrity ](https://solarispremium.com/products/solgi-integrity?_pos=1&_sid=71151eb24&_ss=r)contains 4 grams of l-glutamine per serving along with other proven ingredients to protect the gut barrier, including N-acetyl glucosamine, zinc, deglycyrrhized licorice root extract (DGL), and aloe vera. 6. Vitamins and minerals from cruciferous vegetables Finding a high-quality multivitamin that contains a blend of cruciferous vegetables is a great way to support your detox journey. Cruciferous vegetables are a good source of sulfur-containing compounds, which have been shown to support enzyme production in the liver (7). Research shows that organosulfur compounds (OSCs) also have chemopreventive effects by suppressing the growth of tumor cells (8). B vitamins are especially beneficial for the production of healthy liver enzyme levels (9).
