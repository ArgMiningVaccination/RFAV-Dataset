ABSTRACT 41 Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Dis ease increasingly use alternative and 42 complementary therapies, fo r which appropriate evidence is often lacking. It is 43 estimated that up to half of all patients wit h IBD use various forms of complementary 44 and alternative medicine during some point in their disease course. Considering the 45 frequent use of such therapies, it is crucia l that physicians and patients are informed 46 about their efficacy and safety in order to provide guidance and evidence-based 47 advice. Additionally, increasing evidence suggests that some psychotherapies and 48 mind-body interventions may be beneficial in the management of IB D, but their best 49 use remains a matter of research. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of some 50 of the most commonly used complementary, alternative, and psychotherapy 51 interventions in IBD. 52 53 54 3 55 2. INTRODUCTION 56 Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease where both medical and 57 psychological factors have a major impact on patient\u00b4s quality of life (QoL). Many 58 patients seek alternative and complementary therapies,1 for which appropriate 59 evidence is often absent. However, consideri ng the increasing use of such therapies, 60 it is important that physicians are ready to provide evidence-based advice on their 61 efficacy and potential risks. 62 High levels of psychological and emotional distress, fati gue, anxiety, and depression 63 are common among IBD patients, all comple x symptoms that requi re integrative and 64 appropriate management2,3. Psychotherapies and mind-body interventions may have 65 beneficial impact on coping skills and stress management, but their best use remains 66 undetermined. 67 The aim of this topical review is to pr ovide an overview on the most commonly used 68 complementary, alternative, and psyc hotherapy interventions used in IBD. 69 70 3. METHODS 71 The European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) organized a topical review 72 consensus group on the issue of Complementary Medicine and Psychotherapy in IBD. 73 ECCO topical reviews are dev eloped from expert opinion consensus and are endorsed 74 by ECCO. As controlled data are absent, a t opical review is distinct from ECCO 75 consensus guidelines and is intended to prov ide guidance in clinical areas where 76 scientific evidence is lacking. An open call was announced to all ECCO members; 15 77 individuals were selected based on their exper tise in the topic. Three subgroups were 78 formed. Working Group 1 focused on biologi cally-based practices with the goal of 79 reviewing products such as herbal medici nes, probiotics, marijuana, vitamins, and 80 other dietary supplements. Working Gr oup 2 focused on mind-body practices and 81 psychotherapy interventions, with the goal of reviewing the main psychological 82 domains that are altered in IBD (anxiety , depression, fatigue, etc). The available 83 evidence for the use of hypnosis, yoga, and psychotherapy interventions was 84 reviewed. Finally, Working Group 3 fo cused on manipulative and body-based 85 practices such as acupuncture and exercise. 86 All working groups performed a sy stematic literature search of their topic. Discussions 87 of the published evidence among the workin g group members and a preliminary voting 88 round took place. The working parties me t in Vienna in February 2018 to agree on the 89 statements. Statements were accepted when 80% or more of the participants were in 90 agreement; statements were henceforth termed an agreed Current Practice 91 Position. The group leaders and their respective working group wrote the final section 92 for each subgroup. It is intended that the st atements are read in context, with qualifying 93 comments and not in isolation. The final text was edited for consistency of style by the 94 steering committee and one member of the Guidelines Co mmittee of ECCO who were 95 not involved in the consensus. We recognize that not all products or interventions have 96 4 been included in this review as we chose to focus only on those that are most widely 97 used. 98 99 4. HERBAL THERAPIES AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 100 101 Many studies have assessed a wide range of herbal therapies a nd different herbal 102 preparations in IBD. These are summarized in Table 1. 103 104 a. Cannabis and other herbal therapies 105 106 Current Practice Position 3.1 107 Although the use of Cannabis may be associated with a reduction of some symptoms 108 in IBD, there is no good evidenc e to show that it positively affects the course of disease 109 110 A retrospective observational study on 30 patients showed promising results for 111 Cannabis for the treatment of ac tive Crohn's disease (CD).4 A RCT assessed 22 112 patients who received either Cannabis sativa or placebo cigarettes.5 Response rates 113 and QoL, but not remission rate or reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP), were higher 114 in the intervention group.5 Side effects did not di ffer between the groups. 115 116 Two small controlled studies reported on the use of Artemisia absinthium (wormwood), 117 a herbaceous plant , compared to placebo6 or standard treatment7 for the treatment of 118 active CD (Table 1). 119 120 Current Practice Position 3.2 121 122 Curcumin as a complementary therapy to 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) may be 123 effective in inducing remission in mild-to-m oderately active ulcerative colitis (UC). 124 Curcumin, psyllium, and an herbal preparati on consisting of myrrh, chamomile, and 125 coffee charcoal may be effective as co mplementary maintenanc e therapy in UC. 126 127 For maintenance of remission in CD , a Boswellia extract compared to placebo was 128 investigated in a RCT of 82 patients. There were no signi ficant differences between 129 the groups after 12 months. There were no serious adverse events in both groups.8 130 Another study tested the effects of a traditional Japanese herbal preparation 131 (daikenchuto ) compared to 5-ASA and azathiopr ine among patients who underwent 132 surgery. The results of this study indicated a significantly lower 3- year reoperation rate 133 in the daikenchuto group.9 134 135 High doses of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F, a plant widely us ed in Chinese traditional 136 medicine, led to prolonged remission and was well tolerated.10-13 For prevention of 137 postoperative recurrence, Tripterygium wilfordii was less effective than azathioprine in 138 the long-term.10-13 139 5 140 For treatment of active UC, no differences regarding disease activity or remission rates 141 were observed with curcumin enema plus or al mesalamine, as compared to placebo 142 enema plus oral mesalamine.14 Oral curcumin plus oral mesalamine compared to 143 placebo plus oral mesalamine resulted in more patients achieving endoscopic 144 remission at the end of the 1- month treatment period and mo re patients with clinical 145 improvement in the curcumin group.15 The incidence of adverse effects was not 146 different between t he treatments. 147 148 A study on 44 patients compared Aloe vera gel to placebo and showed significant 149 improvements in clinical signs and QoL afte r 4 weeks. Reductions in histologic score 150 were also observed. No serious adverse events were reported.16 151 152 Two studies evaluated the effects of HMPL-004 ( Andrographis paniculata ).17,18 No 153 significant differences were found in one study, while in the other study higher 154 response rates were observed with HMPL -004. The effects of pomegranate ( Punica 155 granatum ) peels plus standard treatment were compared to placebo plus standard 156 treatment in a st udy on 79 patients.19 Clinical treatment response was higher in the 157 Punica granatum group, although this was not statistically significant. 158 159 Wheat grass showed positive effects on disease activity, rectal bleeding, and 160 abdominal pain.20 Another study on 126 patients assessed Sophora colon-soluble 161 capsules or mesalamine over a period of 8 weeks21. There were no significant 162 differences between groups regarding disease activity or laborat ory measurements. 163 164 For maintenance of remission in UC , curcumin had positive effects on disease activity 165 and recurrence rate at 6 months.22 Curcumin is only available as an over-the-counter 166 food supplement and relevant qu ality concerns regarding the preparation of the herbs 167 may be an issue. 168 169 Treatment with an herbal preparation of myrrh, chamomile, and coffee charcoal versus 170 mesalazine exhibited no signi ficant differences between the treatment groups 171 regarding relapse rates, relapse-free ti me, endoscopy, and faecal biomarkers.23 The 172 herbal preparation was well to lerated and had a good safety pr ofile. This preparation 173 is available as a drug at least in single countries in Europe. 174 175 A study on 80 patients revealed that silymarin in addition to standard therapy had 176 positive effects on haemoglobin levels, eryt hrocyte sedimentation rate, and disease 177 activity.24 However, no significant differenc es between groups were reported. 178 179 Preliminary evidenc e indicates that Holarrhena antidysenterica might be effective but 180 study quality was very low.25 181 182 6 Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM ) herbs are individuali zed based on symptoms and 183 treatments are often based on classificati on of disease patterns. Accordingly, a 184 conclusion about TCM herbs cannot be prov ided. However, TCM shows promising 185 evidence.26-29 186 187 Other herbs not yet evaluated by RCTs show promise in treating IBD. An open pilot 188 study explored the effects of an anthocyanin-rich bilberry preparation in 13 patients 189 with active UC. Over half (63.4%) of the patients achieved remission and 90.9% 190 showed a response.30 191 192 An open-label, dose-escalati ng study on 16 patients with ac tive UC assessed tormentil 193 in escalating doses for 3 weeks. During to rmentil treatment, Colitis Activity Index 194 decreased with highest effect si zes for 1800, 2400, and 3000 mg/day.31 195 196 A non-randomized observational clinical st udy assessed an ayurvedic preparation 197 (extract of Holarrhena antidysenterica , decoction glomerata decoction) in UC patients. Reductions in bowel movements, blood in the 200 stool, and abdominal pain and improvements in general well -being and reduced intake 201 of aminosalicylates were observed.32 202 203 In summary, only few and small trials have inve stigated the role of herbs in the therapy 204 of IBD patients with limited qualit y, which probably limits their routine use in the clinic. 205 206 207 b. Vitamins and minerals 208 209 Current Practice Position 3.3 210 There is insufficient evidence to support the use of vitamins and minerals to induce or 211 maintain remission in CD and UC 212 213 Therapy with vitamin D,14,33-56 vitamin B,57-59 and vitamin K60 has been examined 214 regarding their possible involvement in inflammatory pathways in IBD. 215 216 Vitamin D deficiency is multifactorial in IBD and ranges between 10% to 75% across 217 studies.61 The causes of vitamin D deficiency in patients with IBD include inadequate 218 exposure to sunlight from reduced physi cal activity, inadequate dietary intake, 219 impaired absorption, and impaired conversion of vitamin D.61The use of vitamin D as 220 a therapy has been explored in vitamin D-defic ient IL-10 knockout mice, which develop 221 a rapidly progressive form of IBD. Dis ease was attenuated when these mice were 222 given a high calcium and vitamin D diet.62 Some human studies have examined the 223 role of vitamin D in IBD treatment.35,36,40,63 A study on use of vitamin D as maintenance 224 therapy in CD patients in re mission demonstrated that only 13% of the patients in the 225 vitamin D replacement group relapsed durin g the 12-month study period compared to 226 7 29% in the placebo arm ( p = 0.06).36 Another group compared the therapeutic effects 227 of vitamin D replacement on bone health and CD activity and reported significant 228 improvement during the 6-week follow-up period.35 An accelerated supplementation 229 protocol for patients with CD or UC led to significant improvem ent in symptom-based 230 activity scores (CDAI) but not in objective markers of inflammation.55 231 232 A recent meta-analysis revealed that vitamin B 12 levels were significantly lower in IBD 233 patients than in healthy controls (standar dized mean difference [SMD] -0.57 pg/mL; p 234 < 0.001). However, there was significant heterogeneity in t he included studies.59 235 Mortimore and Florin report ed the impact of high-dose vi tamin B12 on the treatment 236 of 10 consecutive IBD patients with de rmatoses and showed improvement in 237 cutaneous manifestations in 6 patients but not in those with only fistulising CD.58 238 239 A recent review reported the prevalence of vitamin K deficiency in 111 paediatric IBD 240 patients as 54% (CD) and 43.7% (UC), which correlated with higher disease activity 241 and was most likely due to ma labsorption and malnutrition.64 In a study from the 242 Framingham Offspring populatio n, vitamin K levels were inversely correlated with 243 inflammatory markers (such as CRP); it wa s postulated that vitamin K may have anti- 244 inflammatory properties.65 One study reported no signifi cant effects of vitamin K 245 supplementation on bone health st atus in patients with CD.60 No study has 246 investigated the effects of vitamin K suppl ementation on disease activity in IBD. 247 248 c. Dietary supplements 249 250 Current Practice Position 3.4 251 There is insufficient evidence to support the use of diet supplements or specific diets 252 to induce or maintain remission in CD and UC. However, future rese arch should focus 253 on diet as a complementary therapy 254 255 This section is focused on dietary suppl ements other than enter al or parenteral 256 nutrition. A more comprehensive review on diet and nutrition has been published in a 257 separate Topical Review.66 258 259 Common nutritional and dietar y supplements comprise dietary fibre supplements 260 (including prebiotics such as fructo-oligos accharides) and fatty acids. The theorized 261 mechanism underpinning the pathogenesis of IB D is an aberrant response by the 262 mucosal immune system to microbiota in genetically susceptible individuals.67 Short- 263 chain fatty acids such as but yrate, arising from anaerobic fermentation of dietary fibre, 264 are thought to positively influence the gut microbial composition and enhance colonic 265 epithelial barrier function.68-80 The tested forms of fibre delivery in IBD range from 266 dietary advice81 to supplementation. Such supplementation includes 267 psyllium67,81,82 and germinated barley.83-85 A systematic review of three RCTs in UC 268 and one study in pouchitis revealed positive results for the use of fibre 269 supplementation.67 No studies in CD showed added benefit 86-88, while others showed 270 8 equivalence 89,90. The trials examined showed confli cting results. Treatment of UC 271 patients with germinated barley revealed a si gnificant reduction in CRP but not in 272 clinical activity indices.83 However, a separate study on UC patients revealed a 273 significant reduction in clinical indices, but not CRP, after administration of germinated 274 barley.85 275 276 Fructo-oligosaccharides are pr ebiotics that are non-digestibl e, selectively fermentable, 277 short-chain carbohydrates that stimulate the growth or ac tivity of selected beneficial 278 microbial species, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacteria, resulting 279 in potential health benefits to the host.88 An open-label pilot study on CD patients 280 revealed a significant reduction in Harvey-B radshaw index (HBI) and a non-significant 281 reduction in inflamma tory markers (CRP).91 This study was followed up with an 282 adequately powered RCT that did not show a stat istically significant different clinical 283 response.88 Another RCT showed a significant reduction in HBI compared with 284 baseline.92 285 286 Specific diets, such as a diet high in salmon,93 have been examined fo r the treatment 287 of IBD. The purported benefit of salmon is its high n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid 288 (PUFA) content (omega-3) , with the additional benefit of peptides and phospholipids 289 that accompany the fish (see also next paragraph).93 n-3 PUFAs are thought to 290 produce an anti-inflammatory effect thro ugh the reduction of pro-inflammatory 291 cytokines.93 A single-arm open-label pilot study on 12 patients that assessed the 292 efficacy of a salmon-rich diet in patient s with mild-to-moderate UC revealed that an 293 intake of 600 g of salmon weekly over 12 weeks significantly reduced disease activity 294 (p < 0.01), was associated with a trend towards lower CRP, and increased the anti- 295 inflammatory fatty acid index in biopsies and plasma.93 296 297 Despite the current deficiency of quality data for diet supplem ents or specific diets in 298 IBD, dietary therapies have t he potential to be a meaning ful complementary treatment 299 and should be the focus of fu ture research. 300 301 d. Fish oil - omega-3 fatty acids 302 303 Current Practice Position 3.5 304 305 Omega-3 fatty acids might be beneficial in maintaining remission in CD. However, 306 study quality and heterogeneity of trials limit these findings 307 308 Fish oil, or n-3 PUFA, is thought to reduce production of IL-1, IL-6, and tumour necrosis 309 factor.94 Oxidative stress, caused by an imbalance between t he formation of reactive 310 oxygen species and counteracting antioxidants o ccurs in several chronic inflammatory 311 conditions, including IBD. Increasing the antioxidant le vel might reduce tissue damage 312 and the inflammatory process. Fish and fish proteins may have such an antioxidant 313 potential.95-97 A beneficial effect of fish oil and fish protein has been shown in some 314 9 animal models.95 Fish oil is found predominately in oily fish and in commercially 315 produced fish oil capsules. Several studies have been conducted to test the effect of 316 omega-3 fatty acid (FA) supplementation (also called n-3 or -3 FA) on biochemical 317 and clinical outcomes in IBD. 318 319 Among CD patient s, two studies98,99 assessed the effect of n-3 FA compared with n-6 320 FA on biochemical and clinic al markers of inflammation as adjuvant therapy to 321 corticosteroid treatment in patients with active disease. Nielsen et al ( N = 31) showed 322 that n-3 FA had immunomodulatory properties and might inhibit the increase of 323 proinflammatory cytokines in contrast to n-6 FA. Eivindson et al ( N = 31) showed that 324 disease activity and CRP decreased from baseline to week 9 in both the n-3 and the 325 n-6 group.99 326 327 A Cochrane review94 that assessed n-3 FA for the maintenance of remission in CD 328 found a marginal benefit for n-3 FA over placebo in preventing relapse after one year 329 (relapse rate, n-3 group 39% versus placebo 47%, 6 studies, 1039 patients, relative 330 risk [RR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.98). The same trend was also 331 found in two other systematic reviews.100,101 Patients with CD had a significant 332 reduction of relapse risk within one year compared with placebo in favour of n-3. 333 However, there was heterogeneity in the pooled analyses, publication bias, and small 334 negative trials were underestimated. In additi on, no reduction in 1-year relapse rate 335 was observed in the two high-qua lity studies EPIC1 and EPIC2.102 336 337 In patients with UC, two systematic review s found no difference in the relapse rate 338 between n-3 FA supplementation and control groups.100,103 These studies did not 339 record significant adverse events. 340 341 A RCT on 211 patients assessed the effect of a combination of a nutritionally balanced 342 oral supplement enriched with fish oil, fructo-oligosaccharides, gum arabic, vitamin E, 343 vitamin C, and selenium on disease activity and medication use in adults with mild-to- 344 moderate UC. This study revealed similar ra tes of improvement of disease activity 345 score and need for corticosteroids ov er a 6-month period as placebo104. Studies 346 assessing the effect of fish oil on extraintesti nal manifestations (such as joint pain) via 347 administration of seal oil have shown promising results.105-107 A study that compared 348 seal oil and cod liver oil found a tendency toward improvem ent in several joint pain 349 parameters for both oils.107 Another study found positive results for duodenal 350 administration of seal oil (rich in n-3 FAs) compared with soy oil (rich in n-6 FAs). Soy 351 oil tended to aggravate joint pain.105 352 353 e. Probiotics 354 355 Current Practice Position 3.6 356 10 There is no evidence to support the use of pr ebiotics, probiotics, or both in patients 357 with CD, neither in the induc tion nor maintenance of remission. There is no evidence 358 to support the use of prebiotics, probiotics, or both in the postoperative CD patient. 359 360 A recent overview summarized the evi dence for probiotics in IBD patients.108 Two trials 361 (N = 37) evaluated the efficacy of probioti cs in the induction of remission in CD.109,110 362 Both studies failed to show a clinical benefit. Studies evaluating maintenance of 363 remission in quiescent CD patients ( N = 195) also failed to show a statistically 364 significant benefit.111,112 The role of probiotics in prev enting relapse in CD patients in 365 remission following surgically-induced remission ( N = 333) remains controversial and 366 no recommendations on their us e can currently be given.113-116 In summary, there is 367 little evidence for the use of probi otics in the treat ment of CD. 368 369 370 Current Practice Position 3.7 371 Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 may be effective in inducin g and is effective in maintaining 372 remission in UC. A multistrain pr obiotic containing a combinatio n of lactic acid bacteria, 373 streptococcus, and bifidobacteria may be effect ive in inducing and maintaining 374 remission in UC. 375 376 Eight studies evaluated the efficacy of probiotics in inducing remission in patients with 377 active UC.117-124 One study compared nonpathogenic Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 b.d. 378 for 12 weeks with mesalazine for 12 weeks ( N = 116).121 There was no statistically 379 significant difference between the tw o groups. The other seven studies ( N = 535) were 380 RCTs that compared pr obiotics with placebo.117-120,122-124 Three of these trials ( N = 381 319) used a multistrain pr obiotic systematic review108 385 calculated on those three studies showed a number needed to treat of 5 for this 386 multistrain probiotic (95% CI 4-10). mesentericus in the maintenance of remission in 390 quiescent UC.125-130 Of these trials, three co mpared probioti cs with 5-ASAs ( N = compared probi otics with placebo ( N = 122).125,128,129 In 392 summary, probiotics showed efficacy in main taining remission in UC patients. Since 393 probiotics are usually well tolerated, they are useful alternatives to conventional 394 medical therapy especially in UC patients. 395 396 397 5. MIND-BODY MEDICINE AND PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS 398 399 11 A significant proportion of IBD patients repor t or suffer from depression, anxiety, or 400 both. The prevalence rates of these diso rders have been evaluated in four systematic 401 reviews131-134 and two large observational studies,135,136 where they were compared 402 between IBD and healthy and medically ill controls. 403 404 a. Anxiety 405 406 Current Practice Position 4.1 407 408 There are data showing higher rates of anxiety preceding the diagnosis of IBD in adult 409 patients 410 411 412 Current Practice Position 4.2 413 414 Anxiety is common in IBD, particularly during flares, with higher rates than in healthy 415 controls but not in medically ill controls. Anxiety is slightly more common in CD than 416 UC 417 418 419 Adults with IBD are more likely to develop anxiety before IBD onset; 70% of those with 420 IBD and a lifetime history of anxiety or a m ood disorder had a first episode of an anxiety 421 disorder 10 years or more before the IB D diagnosis, whereas just 8% developed 422 anxiety 2 years after IBD onset.136 423 424 The pooled prevalence estimate for anxiety disorders in adult IBD patients is 20.5% 425 (95% CI 4.9-36.5%).133 In CD, the pooled rate of anxiety-related symptoms is 19.1% 426 (\u00b13.63, 95% CI), flares (37% [\u00b19.9, 95% CI]) 132. In UC the pooled rate of anxiety symptoms is 428 31% (\u00b114.2, 95% CI) as compared to 9.6% (\u00b11.94, 95% CI) in healthy controls.132 429 430 In studies where IBD cases were compar ed with medically ill controls, the pooled 431 average rate of anxiety symptoms was 41 .9% (\u00b19.2, 95% CI) for IBD and 48.2% 432 (\u00b131.1, 95% CI) for medi cally ill controls. 433 434 435 b. Depression 436 437 438 Current Practice Position 4.3 439 440 There is data showing higher rates of depression preceding IBD diagnosis in adult 441 patients 442 12 443 444 Current Practice Position 4.4 445 446 Depression is common in IBD, particularly during flares , with higher rates than in 447 healthy controls but not in patient s with other chronic diseases 448 449 Similar to anxiety, 54% of adult IBD patients with a lifetime history of anxiety or mood 450 disorders had an onset of depression 2 years before IBD onset while 23% developed 451 depression 2 years after IBD onset.136 452 453 The pooled prevalence of depressive disor in adults is 15.2% (95% CI 9.9- 454 20.5%). The pooled mean depressive symptoms in IBD is 21.2% (\u00b12.9, 95% 455 CI) compared with 13.4% 95% CI) for healthy controls,132 with a prevalence in CD (25.3%, 20.7-30% ) than UC (16.7%, and in active (40.7%, CI 31. 1-50.3%) versus inactive disease (16.5%, 458 95% CI 7.4-25.5%).133 In the studies with medically ill controls, the pooled mean 459 depression rate was 14.5% (\u00b110.5, 95% CI) in IBD versus 28.4% (\u00b117.7, 95% CI) in 460 medically ill controls. 461 462 c. Stress 463 464 Patients often report stress as a major trigger of both disease and flares; this 465 association has been examined in several studies.3,137-142 In a population-based study 466 (N = 704), only high-perceived st ress was associated with an increased risk of flare 467 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.40, 95% CI 1.35-4.26).140 In two prospective studies3,142 468 each approximately with almost 500 participan ts, perceived stress was associated with 469 symptomatic activity for both CD and UC. Pa tients with persistently active disease 470 reported significantly higher stress than the persistently inactive group (mean stress 471 at 3-month follow 95% CI 16.46- 472 18.45).142 A smaller prospective study on CD patients ( N = 101) also found stress, 473 when paired with avoidance coping, as a significant predictor of flare.141 474 475 476 Current Practice Position 4.5 477 478 There is some evidence that stress is asso ciated with a higher risk of relapse in IBD. 479 There is no data on stress contribut ing to the aetiology of IBD 480 d. Fatigue 481 482 Current Practice Position 4.6 483 484 13 Even if inconsistently defined in the literature, fatigue is common in IBD patients and 485 affects social functioning and QoL. Fatigue is associated with anxiety or depression, 486 disease activity, sleep disturbances, reduced physical activity, me dication use, and 487 anaemia 488 489 Despite extensively studied,2,143-160 fatigue has been inconsistently defined in the 490 literature and commonly report ed as a secondary outcome.144 Vogelaar et al found 491 that several immune parameters were hi gher in fatigued patients, including TNF- (p 492 = 0.02) and IL-12 ( p < 0.001); IL-6 was lower in these patients ( p = 0.002).156 493 494 The reported fatigue prevalence in IBD ranges between 22% to 48% in remission and 495 44% to 86% in moderate-to-severe active disease.2,143,149 Almost 50% of newly 496 diagnosed patients report fatigue.150 Severe anaemia can cause fatigue,146,147 but this 497 is not the case with ir on deficiency without anaemia.152 Other contributors include 498 nutritional deficiency, smoki ng, and immune and genetic factors.145,146,148,156 In an 499 observational study of 631 patients, 50% of patients with anaemia experienced daily 500 fatigue, irrespective of disease activity.153 In a cross-sectional survey ( N = 5382), 501 prolonged use of corticosteroids was asso ciated with fatigue versus non-use (55% 502 = 0.001) in aged >60 years.154 In a systematic review,148 503 depression, stress, sleep disturbances, and anx iety (in this order) were associated 504 with IBD fatigue. Fatigued patients reduce physi cal activity, with an estimated effect 505 size of 1.02 ( p = 0.04).155 Exercise programs could ad dress the physical component 506 of IBD fatigue.155,158 Fatigue reduced QoL in three studies ( N = 84).147 Low QoL can 507 in turn increase fatigue.151 508 509 510 e. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional symptoms in IBD 511 512 The evidence on functional GI disorders is mo stly limited to irritable bowel syndrome 513 (IBS)-type symptoms.161-166 The pooled prevalence of IBS in IBD is approximately 39% 514 (95% CI 30-48%),166 and is slightly lower during 95% CI 25-46%) 515 than during flares (44%, 95% CI 24-64%). When compared with controls, the OR for 516 IBS was 4.89 (95% CI 3.43-6.98) in all IB D patients, 4.39 (95% CI 2.24-8.61) in 517 remission, and 3.89 (95% CI 2. 71-5.59) in active disease. The prevalence of IBS in 518 CD was higher than in UC (46% versus 36%; OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.21-2.18). In a recent 519 cross-sectional study ( N = 6309), Abdalla et al161 observed a 20% rate of self-reported 520 IBS diagnosis. Two large studies ( N = 1321 with IBS-lik e symptoms, N = 6401 for all 521 IBD patients) revealed worse QoL, higher levels of anxiety , depression, fatigue, sleep 522 disturbances, pain interference, and decreased social satisfaction in patients with IBS- 523 like symptoms.161,165 524 525 A cross-sectional study on children ( N = 184)162 found that the prevalence of IBS-type 526 symptoms was highly dependent on the definition of remission. 527 528 14 Current Practice Position 4.7 529 530 IBS is common in IBD and is associated wit h adverse patient-repor ted outcomes. IBS 531 is slightly more common in CD than in UC 532 533 534 f. Sleep 535 536 Evidence regarding sleep disturbance in IBD is based on two case-control 537 studies,167,168 five cohort studies,169-172 and one cross-sectional study.173 538 539 The prevalence of sleep disorders in IBD ranges between 44% and 66% (versus 27- 540 55% in healthy controls and 67-73% in IBS).168,169,171,173 Even in remission, IBD 541 patients ( N = 119) report significantly more sleep disturbance (prolonged sleep 542 latency, frequent sleep fragmentation, high us e of sleeping pills, and poor overall sleep 543 quality) than healthy controls; rate s were however similar to IBS.167 Sleep disturbance 544 is slightly more common in CD than in UC.167 Two prospective cohort studies171,172 (N 545 = 3214) found an association between poor sl eep quality and disease activity. Several 546 cohort studies ( N = 1468) suggest an association bet ween poor sleep quality and an 547 increased risk of IBD relapse at 6 months to 1 year.169,171,174 548 549 550 Current Practice Position 4.8 551 552 There is limited evidence on the frequency of sleep disturbanc e in IBD. Some studies 553 report higher rates of sleep disturbanc e in IBD than in healthy controls 554 555 In summary, anxiety and depression are common in IBD. High perceived stress is 556 associated with a higher risk of relapse. Fa tigue is common in IBD and is associated 557 with higher disease activity and increased rates of anxiety and depression. IBS is 558 common in IBD and is associated with poorer patient-reported out comes. There is 559 limited evidence on the frequency of sleep di sturbance in IBD and further studies 560 focused on sleep in IBD are needed. 561 562 g. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) 563 564 Current Practice Position 4.9 565 566 Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has a short-term beneficial effect on QoL in 567 adults with IBD. There is limited evidence on the efficacy of CBT in adolescents; early 568 reports are promising in terms of QoL and coping 569 570 15 CBT is a type of psychotherapy that teaches patients to identify and modify unhelpful 571 negative thinking styles and maladaptive behav iours. It has a shorter duration than 572 traditional psychotherapi es (6-12 weeks).139 Common elements of CBT include 573 exploration of the links between cognitions and emotions, cognitive restructuring and 574 challenging unhelpful thoughts, psycho- education, coping, and relaxation. 575 576 The evidence on the effectiveness of CBT in IBD has been summarized in two meta- 577 analyses138,175 and two systematic reviews.139,176 CBT seems to improve the short- 578 term QoL in adults ( N = 254, SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.02-0.72),175 albeit with little or no 579 effect on disease activity, anxiety, depression, and perceived stress.139,176 A positive 580 short-term effect of CBT on 581 95% CI 0.26-1.25) wa s noted in adolescents ( N = 71).138 582 583 584 h. Hypnotherapy 585 586 Current Practice Position 4.10 587 588 There is limited evidence on the efficacy of hypnotherapy to reduce IBD symptoms, 589 maintain clinical remission, and increase QoL in UC 590 591 The effectiveness of hypnotherapy (treatm ent involving deep relaxation, focused 592 attention, and an enhanced ability to fo llow suggestions) has been studied in 593 IBD.138,139,175,177 A small study showed an immune -modulating effect of a 50-minute 594 session of gut-directed hypnotherapy in 17 pati ents with active UC.139,177 Three pre- 595 post hypnotherapy studies ( N = 2, CD, with a 6-month follow up; N = 8, IBD; N = 15, 596 severe UC with 5.4-year follow up) and one trial in UC ( N = 23) have shown that 597 hypnotherapy improves QoL and reduces bowel symptoms.139,177 One RCT in 598 quiescent UC ( N = 54) showed that gut -directed hypnotherapy maintains clinical 599 remission (68% for hypnosis versus 40% of controls maintained remission for 1 year; 600 p = 0.04).139,175,177 601 602 603 i. Other psychotherapies 604 605 Current Practice Position 4.11 606 607 Psychodynamic therapy may reduce depressi ve and anxiety symptoms. Stress 608 management has only modest benefits in r educing IBD symptoms and improving 609 mental health or QoL. Solution-focused ther apy (SFT) might be bene ficial for patients 610 with fatigue 611 612 16 The evidence on the effectiveness of psyc hodynamic therapy and as well as SFT in 613 IBD is based on two meta-analyses and two systematic reviews138,139,175,176. Other 614 psychotherapies such as psychodynamic (P D) therapy and stress management (SM) 615 interventions have also been investigated in IBD.138,139,175,176 PD is derived from 616 traditional psychoanalysis and focused on working with transference (i.e., the 617 redirection of childhood emotions to a therapist). Common elements of PD are 618 interpretation, empathic validation, free a ssociation, and analysis of transference, 619 regression, and resistance.139 PD must be used as a l ong-term therapy (20-52 weeks 620 in IBD trials). SM is focused on develop ing strategies to manage stress and includes 621 breathing exercises, relaxation, biofeedba ck, and problem solving (typically 6-8 622 sessions). SFT uses the patient's past experi ences to address current difficulties and 623 relies on identifying solutions that worked in the past and finding exceptions to the 624 patient's problems (typically 5-6 sessions). No or minimal effect of PD, SM, and SFT 625 on long-term disease activity have thus far been observed.138,139,175,176 Significant 626 short-term improvements in QoL and fatigue were observed in patients with elevated 627 fatigue scores receiving SFT.175 There is limited evidence fo r SM and PD to improve 628 mental health and QoL.139,176 629 630 j. Meditation, mindfulness, and relaxation 631 632 Current Practice Position 4.12 633 634 Meditation and relaxation may improve Q oL and possibly decrease inflammatory 635 activity in IBD. There is limited evidenc e on the effectiveness of mindfulness-based 636 interventions on disease activity 637 638 Meditation is a broad term encompassing pr actices aimed at reaching a heightened 639 level of consciousness and concentration. Mindfulness is a type of meditation 640 dedicated to being present in the moment. It involves activities where one focuses on 641 a particular sensation, such as taste or smell, and brings t he mind to breathing. 642 Relaxation is a process of reducing t ension in the body and mind and may involve 643 breathing activities or tensing and rela xing different muscle groups. Meditation, 644 mindfulness, and relaxation are often used as part of psychotherapies but also as 645 standalone treatments to promote wellbeing. 646 647 While older trials in IBD ( N = 136) reported improvements in symptoms, psychosocial 648 wellbeing, and QoL using relaxation and st ress management, recent trials found 649 benefit on QoL only (2 RCTs, N = 121).178 Two recent studies ( N = 29179 and N = 60180) 650 showed that mindfulness improved psychol ogical and physical symptoms in IBD and 651 reduced CRP levels.179 Norton et al181 showed pain reduction using relaxation, 652 meditation, or both in four out of six studies. Timmer et al138 showed no evidence for 653 the efficacy of relaxation in unselected adults with IBD. 654 655 h. Yoga 656 17 657 Current Practice Position 4.13 658 659 There is limited evidence on the efficacy of yoga to reduce IBD symptoms. Yoga 660 improves QoL in adults with IBD 661 662 The largest survey performed to date ( N = 235)182 reported that 16. 3% of paediatric 663 IBD patients (aged 2-22 years) pr acticed yoga, meditation, or tai chi, while the second 664 survey ( N = 67, aged 12-19 years) reported that 10% of patients practiced yoga.183 665 One trial184 (N = 60, UC; N = 40, CD; all adults in remi ssion) compared an 8-week 666 yoga intervention to treatment as usual (TAU). The study showed yoga to be no 667 different than TAU, except for colic pai n that was reduced in the yoga group ( p < 0.05). 668 Another RCT185 (N = 77; adults with UC in remission) on patients with impaired QoL 669 who received 12 sessions of yoga or writt en self-care advice showed yoga to be 670 effective in improving QoL after 12 and 24 weeks ( p = 0.018 and p = 0.022, 671 respectively). Yoga also improved disease activity after 24 weeks ( p = 0.029). 672 673 In summary, CBT improves QoL in IBD over the short term. Although the evidence on 674 the efficacy of hypnotherapy to reduce IB D symptoms is limited, the efficacy of 675 hypnotherapy in functional gut disorders186 warrant future studies in IBD. PD therapy 676 and SM may reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms, but not IBD severity. SFT 677 might be beneficial for pati ents with fatigue. Meditation and relaxation may improve 678 QoL and inflammatory activity in IBD. Evid ence on the effect of mindfulness-based 679 interventions on disease activity is limited and the role of this intervention in IBD 680 management should be further explored. There is limited evidence on the efficacy of 681 yoga to reduce IBD symptoms, but yoga may improve QoL in adults with IBD. 682 683 6. MANIPULATIVE AND BODY-BASED INTERVENTIONS 684 685 a. Moxibustion and acupuncture 686 687 Current Practice Position 5.1 688 689 There is insufficient evidence to suppor t the use of moxibustion and acupuncture 690 (either in monotherapy or in combination) for the treatment of active UC or CD 691 692 The term acupuncture (AP) refers to the in sertion of needles for remedial purposes 693 into specific points (acupoint receptors).187 Moxibustion is a procedure involving the 694 use of heat generated by burning material, wh ich is then applied to certain areas of 695 the body (usually AP points187) where it stimulates superficial and deep tissues of the 696 skin.188 Several burning materials can be used, the most usual being moxa (herbal 697 preparation containing Artemisia vulgaris). Direct moxibustion is applied directly to the 698 skin around an acupuncture point, whereas i ndirect moxibustion or herb-partitioned 699 18 moxibustion (HPM) is performed with some insulating materials between the moxa 700 cone and the skin.187-189 AP and moxa are often used in combination. 187 Several 701 human studies have assessed the clinical benefit of these interventions in IBD 702 (Supplementary Table 1). 703 Moxibustion alone 704 A systematic review and meta-analysis asse ssed the evidence of moxibustion alone 705 for the treatment of UC;189 five RCTs conducted in China were included, three of which 706 compared moxibustion with sulfasalazine (SASP) and the remaining two compared 707 moxibustion to SASP and other drugs (antib iotics, steroids). The efficacy of 708 moxibustion was based on physician's asse ssment (recovery, marked improvement, 709 improvement, and no change) or endoscopy. The meta-analysis suggested a small 710 favourable effect of moxibustion when co mpared with SASP alone (RR 1.23, 95% CI 711 1.04-1.46; p = 0.01) or SASP combined with steroids or antibiotics (RR 1.33, 95% CI 712 1.11-1.59; p = 0.002) with overall low heterogeneity. However, all trials were non- 713 blinded and reported incomple te outcome measures, and were therefore considered 714 to have a high risk of bias.189 Furthermore, non-standard measures of clinical and 715 endoscopic activity were used, thus greatly limiting the conclusions. 716 Acupuncture versus moxibustion 717 Moxibustion and e-AP were compared as s eparate treatments in a randomized study 718 of CD patients in sustained remission. Thir ty-six patients were randomly assigned to 719 e-AP or moxa treatment over 12 weeks. In both arms there was a significant reduction 720 of CDAI and a significant increase in the In flammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire 721 (IBDQ); no significant difference was seen between both interventions.190 722 723 Acupuncture combined with moxibustion 724 The efficacy and safety of AP with moxibustion were evaluated in patients with mild- 725 to-moderate CD; 92 subjects were random ly assigned to receive either active 726 treatment (HPM with AP) or placebo (wheat-bran-par titioned moxa combined with 727 superficial needle applic ation in non-acupoints) over 12 weeks. Both groups had a 728 significant reduction in the CDAI and IBDQ at week 12, which was si gnificantly greater 729 in the active treatment arm ( p < 0.001). Patients in the ac tive treatment group also 730 showed a significant impr ovement in haemoglobin ( p = and histopathological scores ( p = 0.029) when compared with placebo. No significant 732 difference was found in endoscopy.191 733 Another randomized, single-bl ind trial evaluated the e fficacy of the combined 734 methods in reducing CDAI af ter 4 weeks of treatment. Pa tients with m ild-to-moderate 735 CD were randomly assi gned to receive 10 AP sessions over 4 weeks or sham AP. 736 All patients in the AP arm were treated with Artemisia Moxa . Fifty-one patients were 737 treated (27 in the active ar m and 24 in the control arm) . While CDAI reduction was 738 significantly higher in the treatment arm ( p = 0.003), the overall remission rates were 739 not statistically different between the two arms. QoL was improved in both arms 740 although the difference did not reach statis tical significance ( p = 0.064).192 741 742 19 Two large studies assessed the efficacy of AP combined with moxibustion in 743 UC.193,194 In one study, 121 patients were random ly assigned to receive either AP ( N 744 = 76) or SASP 1 to 2 g four times/day ( N = 45) over a period of 20 to 60 days. In the 745 intervention group, 59% of patients ent ered remission as compared with 39% of 746 patients in the control group. Low-quality trial design affe cted the validity of these 747 results.193 In another study on 123 patients with mild-to-m oderate UC, HPM with AP 748 was compared with sham interventi on (bran-partition moxibustion).194 A significant 749 improvement (defined as disappearance of clinical symptoms and normal colonic 750 mucosa by sigmoidoscopy) was observed in 52.5% of patient s treated with HPM 751 versus 24.5% of patients that received sham intervention. No baseline description of 752 patient features was provided (such as ex tent of colitis, Mayo score, concomitant 753 therapies during the trial), making t he results difficult to interpret.194 In another small 754 RCT in mild-to-moderate UC, 29 patients were randomly assigned to receive AP plus 755 moxibustion or sham AP for 5 weeks. Disease activity was measur ed by the Colitis 756 Activity Index (CAI) and QoL with IBDQ and a 10-point VAS. The treatment group 757 showed a significant decrease in CAI after treatment ( p < 0.001) and the benefit was 758 maintained th roughout the 16-week follow-up ( p < 0.001). Although patients in the 759 control group showed an improv ement in disease activity, treatment was significantly 760 superior ( p = 0.048). In the treatment group, CAI was statistica lly lower than that at 761 baseline ( p < 0.001). QoL was improv ed in both groups.195 762 763 Finally, a meta-analysis exam ined the clinical efficacy of AP and/or moxibustion 764 compared with SASP for the treatment of UC.196 The overall efficacy of AP alone, 765 moxibustion alone, or AP co mbined with moxibustion was greater than the efficacy of 766 SASP (RR 5.42, 95% CI 3.38-8.68; p < 0.0001). However, the trials were 767 underpowered and were mostly of low qua lity with subjective assessments of 768 efficacy.196 Additionally, true blinding was questi oned to be even possible, as the 769 acupuncturist always knows if the needle is inserted in an acupoint or not. Moreover, 770 needle insertion can lead to nonspecific physiological responses and this could 771 explain why in some studies an improv ement was also obta ined with sham 772 acupuncture.197 773 774 In summary, the low quality of the published studi es, even if with positive results, 775 precludes any valid conclu sion and reco mmendations. 776 777 b. Chiropractic treatment and Osteopathy 778 779 Current Practice Position 5.2 780 781 There is minimal evidence on the efficacy of chiropractic and osteopathy in the 782 management of active CD 783 784 Chiropractic and osteopathy are two diffe rent types of CAM. Chiropractic 785 treatment involves manual therapy, usually spinal manipulation therapy, but also 786 20 manipulations of other jo ints and soft tissues. Osteopathy involves massage, 787 stretching, pressure, and mobilizati on of various tissues or organs.198,199 A summary 788 of the major studies on chiropractic and os teopathy can be found in Supplementary 789 Table 2. 790 791 In a longitudinal, population- based study of health outcome s in an IBD cohort, among 792 patients that used CAM, 14% used chiropractic treatament.200,201 In a study from 793 Sweden, 5.4% of IBD patient s made use of chiropractic therapy compared with 5.7% 794 of the normal population.202 795 796 There is limited data on the use and benefit of chiropracti c and osteopathy as CAM in 797 IBD, with only two randomized tr ials published. In a single- blind study, CD patients in 798 remission were randomised into two groups. Th e aim of the study was to determine if 799 there was an improvement in IBDQ score following visceral os teopathic treatment. 800 Fourteen patients received visceral osteopathic technique at the root of the mesentery. 801 The root of the mesentery give s rise to the mesentery of t he small intestine and is the 802 region connected to the structures in front of the vertebral column. The control group 803 (N=13) did not receive any osteopathic treat ment and had virtual manipulation, which 804 consisted of palpation of the small intestine and col on without action on the 805 vasculature and innervations. Change in Qo L was assessed using the IBDQ. The 806 IBDQ score increased significantly ( p < 0.001) in the group treated with osteopathy; 807 no significant change was obser ved in the control group ( p = 0.22).199 In another study, 808 38 CD patients who were in remission receiv ing infliximab were randomly assigned 809 2:1 to receive osteopathic or sham therapy at 15, 30, and 45 days after infliximab 810 infusion. The severity of IBS-like symptom s was significantly reduced in patients 811 receiving osteopathy ( p = 0.01, p = 0.04, and p = 0.05 at day 30, 45, and 60, 812 respectively).203 813 814 There are currently no publishe d studies evaluating chiropra ctic and osteopathy in 815 patients with UC or IBDU. 816 817 c. Exercise 818 819 Current Practice Position 5.3 820 821 Exercise can have beneficial effects on over all health, physical well-being, perceived 822 stress, and QoL of IBD patients. There is promising but lim ited evidence on the role of 823 exercise both in protec tion from IBD development and in disease management 824 825 Regular exercise exerts anti-inflammatory effects, which may be mediated through a 826 reduction in visceral fat mass (with a c onsequent decreased release of adipokines) 827 and the induction of an anti- inflammatory environment.204,205 828 829 21 In a retrospective database analysis, a se dentary occupation was associated with a 830 two-fold increase in IBD incidence.206 In two large prospective female 831 cohorts, physical activity was inversely associated with risk of CD but not of UC.207 832 Compared with women with low physical activity , the multivariate adjusted hazard ratio 833 (HR) of CD among women with very high ph ysical activity was 0.64 (95% CI 0.44- 834 0.94).207 Active women with at least a 27 me tabolic equivalent task (MET) hours/week 835 of physical activity had a 44% reduction ( HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.84) in risk of 836 developing CD compared with sedentar y women with <3 MET hours/week.207 In a 837 case-control study the RR of CD was inversel y related to regular physical activity 838 (weekly exercise, RR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.9; daily exercise , RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9).208 839 Furthermore, in a recent meta-analysis it was demonstrated that physical activity has 840 a protective effect against developing CD.209 No significant inverse association 841 between physical activity and UC was observed. 842 843 Exercise could be used in the treatment of IBD either for its anti-inflammatory potential 844 or for symptom relief.210 Several studies have been per formed on IBD patients (Table 845 2)179,207,208,211-216 and have shown that exercise coul d be beneficial via a positive effect 846 on QoL. However, these studies were limited by small sample size. In the largest study 847 to date, 117 CD patients in remission w here randomized to either a low-impact 848 exercise program or no prescribed exer cise. The primary endpoint was bone mineral 849 density (g/cm2) measured at baseline and at 12 m onths at the hip and spine (L2-L4) 850 by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. This st udy revealed that exercise was associated 851 with increasing bone mineral density. E ffects on disease activity were not 852 measured.211 A prospective study216 on CD patients in remission (CDAI < 150) 853 revealed that those with higher exercise levels were significantly less likely to develop 854 active disease at 6 months. In UC patient s in remission, those with higher exercise 855 levels were also less likely, albeit non-si gnificantly, to develop active disease at 6 856 months. 857 858 Data are lacking regarding the intensity and type of exercise . Furthermore, for active 859 disease there is a possibilit y that exercise could exac erbate symptoms, as more 860 rigorous exercise may cause gastrointestina l symptoms such as bl oating, cramps, and 861 urgency to defecate.217 A trial assessing two exercise regimens in adults with inactive 862 or mildly active CD is currently underway.218 New technology, including next- 863 generation wearable physical activity tracke rs, could potentially improve exercise 864 studies and might be used to promote physical activity219 in IBD patients. 865 866 867 7. CONCLUSION 868 Various types of CAMs and psychotherapy inte rventions are available. However, for 869 most of them, the lack of rigorously conducted trials has hampered their use. 870 Regarding psychotherapy and mind-body intervent ions, a positive effect on quality of 871 life has been reported; effect in disease ac tivity is less clear. Physicians should be 872 22 informed about the evidence behind most frequently used CAMs and be ready to 873 provide advice to their patients. Fu rther research is needed before strong 874 recommendations can be made. 875 876 877 878 879 Working Groups 880 881 WG1: Herbal therapies and dietary supplements 882 Leader - Jost Langhorst exercise, Germany 883 Member - Randi Opheim, Norway 884 Member - Stephan Vavricka, Switzerland 885 Y-ECCO - Chamara Ba snayake, Australia 886 Y-ECCO - Nik Ding, Australia 887 WG2: Mind-body medicine and psyc hotheraputic interventions 888 Leader - Antonina Mikocka-Walus, Australia 889 Member - Manuel Barreiro-de Acosta, Spain 890 Member - Gabriele Moser, Austria 891 Y-ECCO - Carolina Palmela, Portugal 892 Gianluca Pellino, Italy 893 WG3: Manipulative and body-based interventions 894 Leader - Pierre Ellul, Malta 895 Member - Daniela Gilardi, Italy 896 Member - Konstantin os Katsanos, Greece 897 Y-ECCO - Sander van der Marel, The Netherlands 898 899 900 Reviewers on behalf of GuiCom 901 902 Glen Doherty 903 904 905 Conflict of Interest 906 907 ECCO has diligently maintained a disclosure po licy of potential conf licts of interests 908 [CoI].
