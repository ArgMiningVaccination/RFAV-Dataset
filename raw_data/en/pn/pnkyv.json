The National Science E ducation Standards present a vision o fa scientifical ly literate popula ce.They outline what stud ents ne ed to kno w,understand,and be able to do t o be scientifical ly literate at diff erent grade levels.They describe an e ducational syst em in which all stud ents d emonst rate high le v- els of perfor mance, in which tea chers are empowere d to make the d ecisions essential for effectiv e learning ,in which int erlocking communities o f teachers and stud ents ar e focused on learning science, and in whic h supportiv e educational p rograms and sy s- tems nur ture a chievement. The Standards point toward a fu ture that is challenging b ut attainable\u2014which is w hy they are w ritten in the p resent t ense. The int ent ofthe Standards can b e expressed in a single phrase: Science stan - dards f or all stud ents.The phrase emb odies both e xcellence and e Standards apply to all stud ents,regardless o fage, gen- der, cultural or ethnic ba ckground,disabili - ties,aspirations, or interest and mot ivation in science. Different stud ents will a chieve the kno wledge and skills describ ed in the Standards , even as some stud ents go w ell beyond these le vels. By emphasizing both e xcellence and e qui- ty,the Standards also highlight the ne ed to give stud ents the o pport unity to learn sci - ence. Stud ents cannot a chieve high le vels of mance without a fessional chers,adeq uate time,a rich ar ray oflearning mat erials, acco mmo - dating w ork spa ces,and the resour ces ofthe communities sur rounding their schools. Responsibility f or providing this sup port falls on all those in volved with the scienc e education syst em. Implementing the Standards will require major changes in much o fthis count ry's sci - ence e ducation. The Standards rest on the premise that science is an a ctive process. Learning science is something that stud ents do,not something that is d one to them. activ ities, while essential,ar must ha ve \"minds-o n\" experiences as w ell. The Standards call f or mo re than \"scienc e as process,\"in which stud . Inquiry is c entral lear n- ing. When engaging in inquir y,stud ents describe o bjects and e vents,ask questions, construct explanations, test those explana - tions against cur rent scientific kno wledge, and c ommunicate their ideas to othe rs.

Continuing dialogues b etween those who set and implement standards at the national, state, and local le vels will ensure that the Standards evolve to me et the ne eds ofstu- dents,educators,and socie ty at large.

Org a n i z a tion of the St a n d a rd s After an int roductory chap ter and a chap - ter giving b road principles and d efinitions of ter ms,the National Science E ducation Standards are p resent ed in six chap ters: nStandards for science teaching (Chapter 3). nStandards for professional de velop - ment for teachers of scienc e (Chapter 4). nStandards for assessment in scienc e educ ation (Chapter 5). nStandards for science con tent (Chapter 6). nStandards for science educ ation pr o- grams (Chapter 7). nStandards for science educ ation systems (Chapter 8).

S c i e n c e Te a c h i n g St a n d a rd s The science tea ching standards describ e what tea chers ofscience at all g rade levels should know and be able to d o.

For tea chers to design and implement ne w ways of teaching and learning science, the pract ices, policies, and o verall culture o f most schools must change. Such r eforms cannot be a ccomplished on a pie cemeal o r ad hoc basis. Considerations o f equity are critical in the science tea ching standards.

Assessments can be d one in many diff er- ent wa ys.Besides c onve ntional pap er and pencil tests, assessments might inc er- to be developmental ly appropr iate, set in c on- texts familiar to stud ents,and as fr ee from bias as possible. At the dist rict,state, and national le vels,assessments ne ed to in volve teachers in their design and administ ration, have well-thought-out g oals,and rea ch rep- resentat ive groups to a void sampling bias. Assessments also ne ed to measure the opport unity o fstud ents to learn science. Such assessments might measure tea chers' professional kno wledge, the time a vailable to tea ch science, and the resour ces available to stud ents.Although difficult, such e valua- tions are a critical part o fthe Standards .S c i e n c e Co nte nt St a n d a rd s The science c ontent standards outline what stud ents should kno w,understand, and be able to do in the natural sciences over the course o fK-12 e ducation. They ar e divided into eight cat egor ies: nUnifying concepts and pr nScience in personal and social perspectiv e. nHistory and nature of scienc e. The first cat egor y is p resent ed for all grad e levels,because the und erstanding s and abilities associat ed with these c oncepts need to be d eveloped throughout a stud ent's educational exp eriences. The other se ven categor ies are c lustered for grade levels K-4, 5-8, and 9-12. E ach co n tent standard states that as a re sult of activ i ties prov i ded for all st u den t s in those grade leve l s ,the co n tent of the stan- d a rd is to be under s tood or certain ab i l i ti e s a re to be deve l oped .The standards refer to broad areas of co n ten t ,su ch as ob j ects in the s ky, the interdepe n den ce of o r ga n i s m s , or the nat u re of s c i en t ific know l ed ge .

Each school and dist rict must t ranslat e the National Science E ducation Standards into a p rogram that r eflects local c ontexts and policies. The p rogram standards discuss the planning and a ctions ne eded to p rovide comprehensi ve ed stud ents across all g rade levels.This can be d one in many wa ys,because the Standards do not dictate the o rder, o rganiza - tion, or frame work for science p rograms. S c i e n c e Ed u c at i o n Sys tem S t a n d a rd s The science e ducation syst em standards consist o fcriteria for judging the p erfor- mance o fthe seven policies tha t influence science educ ation with the teaching ,professional de velop - men t,assessmen t, content,and program standards . nThe co o rd i n a tion of science educa t i o n policies within and across agencies,i n s t i t u t i o n s , and or g a n i z at i o n s . nThe continuity of science educ ation policies o ver . nThe pr of policies on science educ ation. nThe r e s po n s i b i l i t y of individuals to a c h i e ve the new vision of science e d u c ation p o rt r ayed in the standar d s. Schools are part o fhierarchical syst ems that inc lude school dist ricts, state school systems,and the national e ducation syst em. Schools also are part o f communities that contain organizations that influence scienc e education, including colle ges and uni versi- ties,nature c enters,parks and museums, businesses, laboratories,community organi - zations, and various media. Although the school is the c entral instit u- tion f or public e ducation,all parts o fthe extended syst em ha ve a resp onsibility f or improving science lit eracy. For example, func tions g enerally decided at the state (b ut some times at the local) le vel include the content ofthe school science cur riculum, the char acter istics o fthe science p rogr am, the nature o fscience tea ching ,and assess - ment p ractices. These policies ne ed to b e consist ent with the vision o fscience e duca- tion describ ed in the Standards for the vision as a whole to be realiz ed. Today,different parts o fthe e ducatio n system oft en work at cross pur poses, result - ing in waste and c onflict.Only when most individuals and organizations share a c om- mon vision can we exp ect true excellence in science e ducation to be a chieved.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In addition, concerns regarding e conomic c ompetitiveness st ress the c entral imp ortance o fscience and math - ematics e ducation that will allow us to k eep pace with our global c ompetitors. Why Na t i o n a l S c i e n c e Ed u c at i o n St a n d a rd s ? The term \" standard\"has multiple meanings. Science e ducation standards are crit eria to judge qualit y:the quality o f what stud ents know and are able to do; the quality o fthe science p rograms that p rovide the o pportu- f science; ofscience tea ching; the quality o fthe syst em that sup ports science tea chers and p ro- grams; and the quality o fassessment p rac- tices and policies. Science e ducation stan dards p rovide crit eria to judge p rogress toward a national vision o flearning and teaching science in a syst em that p romotes excel lence, prov iding a banner around which r eformers can ral ly. A hal l m a r k of A m erican ed u c a ti o n is lo c a l con tro l ,wh ere bo a rds of ed u c a ti o n and te ach ers make de c i s i o ns ab o ut what st u den t s wi ll lear n .Na ti onal standards pr e s ent cr i teri a by w h i ch ju d gm e nts can be made by state and local sc h ool per s on n e l and co m mu n i -ti e s ,h e lping them to de c i de wh i ch curr i c u- lu m ,s t a f f deve l opm ent activ i ty, or assess- m ent program is appropr i a te .

Some outstanding things hap pen in sci - ence classr ooms today, eve n without natio n- al standards. But they hap pen because ext ra- ordinary tea chers do what ne eds to be d one despite c onve ntional p ractice.Many g ener- ous tea chers spend their o wn money on sci - ence supplies, knowing that stud ents lear n best by in vestigation. These tea chers igno re the v ocabulary-d extbooks and encour - age stud ent inquir y. They also make their science courses r elevant to stud ents'lives, instead o fsimply b eing p reparation f or another school science course. Implementation o ftheNational Scienc e Education Standards will highlight and p ro- mote the best p ractices o fthose ext raordi- nary tea chers and g ive them the r ecog nitio n and sup port they dese rve.School p rincipals who find money in their budg ets for field trips,parents whose bake-sale p rocee ds pur - chase science e quipment, and publishe rs who are pione ering authentic assessments despite the mar ket for multiple-choice tests will also be r ecog nized and encourag ed.

These g oals d efine a scientifical ly literate socie ty. T he standards f or content define what the scientifical ly literate p erson should know,understand, and be able to do aft er 13 years o fschool science. The separate stan - dards f or assessment, teaching , progr am, and syst em describe the c onditions ne ces- sary to a chieve the g oal lit eracy for all stud ents that is describ ed in the c on- tent standards. Schools that implement the Standards will ha ve stud ents learning science by a ctive- ly engaging in inquiries that are int eresting and imp ortant to them. Stud ents the reby will establish a kno wledge base f or und er- standing science. In these schools, teachers will be emp owere d to make d ecisions abou t what stud ents learn,how they learn ed.Teachers and stud ents t ogether will be memb of a community f ocused on learning scienc ewhile b eing em. Stud ents could not a chieve the standards in most o f today's schools. Implementatio n ofthe Standards will require a sustained, long-t erm commitment to change. Hi s to r y of the National Science Ed u ca t i o n St a n d a rd s Setting national g oals and d eveloping national standards to me et them are r ecent strategies in our e ducation r eform policy . Support for national e ducation standards b y state g over nments o riginat ed in 1989, when the National Go vernors Associatio n endorsed national e ducation g oals. President Ge orge Bush immediat ely add ed his sup port by f orming the National Education Goals Panel. The sup port for standards was c ontinued by the new admin - istration aft er the ele ction o f President William Clint on. The first standards ap peared in 1989, when mathematics e ducators and mathe - maticians addressed the subje ct ofnational standards with two publications: Curriculum and E valuation Standards for Scho ol Mathematic s, by the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) (1989); and Everybody Counts: A R eport to the Nation on the Future o f Mathematic s Education, by the National Resear ch Council (1989).

The National Science E ducation Standards had se veral imp ortant p recurso rs.In 1983, A Nation at Risk was published,calling f or reconsideration and r eform ofthe U.S. syst f Science,the National Science Resour ces Center (NSRC),and the T echnical Education Resour ces Center all d eveloped inno vative science cur ricula. In 1989, the American Association f or the Advancement ofScience (AAAS), through its P roject 2061, publishe dScience for All A mericans, defining scientific lit eracy for all high school g radu- ates. Somewhat lat er,the National Scienc e Teachers oordination P roject, publishe dThe Cont ent Cor e. In sp ring o f1991, the NSTA p resi- dent,reflecting a unanimous vote o fthe NSTA b oard, wrote to Dr . Frank P ress\u2014 president ofthe National Academ y of Sciences and chairman o fthe National Resear ch Council (NRC)\u2014asking the NR C to d evelopment o fnational sci - ence e ducation standards. The p residents o f several leading science and science e duca- tion associations, the U.S. secretary o f edu- cation,the assistant dir ector for educatio n and human resour ces at the National Science Foundation, and the c ochairs o fthe National Education Goals Panel all encour - aged the NRC to play a leading role in the effort to d evelop national standards f or sci-ence e ducation in c ontent,teaching ,and assessment.Sho rtly the reafter,major fund - ing f or this p roject was p rovided by the Department o fEducation and the National Science Foundation. To oversee the imp ortant p rocess o fstan- dards d evelopment, the NRC established the National C ommitt ee on Science Educatio n Standards and Assessment (NCSESA). The committ ee was chair ed suc cessively by Dr . James Eb ert and (fr om N ovember 1993) Dr . Richard Klausne r. In addition, the Chair' s Advisory Committ ee was f ormed, consisting of repr esentat NSTA,AAAS, o fState Scienc e Supervisors,the Earth Science Educatio n Coalition, and the National Association o f Biology Tea chers.This g roup help ed to identify and r ecruit staff and volunt eers for all ofthe c ommitt ees and w orking g roups that w ere required. The over s i ght co m m i t t ee (NCSESA) fir s t m et in May 1992, and the three wor k i n g groups (co n ten t ,te ach i n g , and assessme n t ) e ach held intense working sessions over the su m m e r. An initial phase of s t a n d a r ds devel- opm ent lasted thr o u gh the fall of 1 9 9 3 . Du ring that 18 mo n t h s ,i n p u t to the stan- d a rds was solicited from large n u m b ers of s c i- en ce te ach ers ,s c i en ti s t s , s c i en c e edu c a tors , and many others inter e s ted in scie n ce edu c a- ti on .

Science in our schools must be f or all st u- dents:All stud ents,regardless o fage,sex, cultural or ethnic ba ckground, disabilities, aspirations, or interest and mot ivation in science, should ha ve the o pport unity t o attain high le vels ofscientific lit eracy.

Excel lence in science ideal that all stud ents can a chieve understanding o fscience if they are g iven the o pport unity. The content standards describe ou tcomes\u2014what stud ents should understand and be able to d o,not the man - ner in which stud ents will a chieve those outcomes. Stud ents will chieve und er- in diff erent wa ys and at diff erent depths as they answ er questions about the natural w orld.And stud ents will a chieve the outcomes rates, some so oner than othe rs.But all should ha ve opport uni- ties in the f orm of multiple exp eriences o ver several years to d evelop the und erstanding associat ed with the Standards . The co m m i tm e nt to scie n ce for all stu- dents has implicat i ons for both progr a m de s i gn and the ed u c a ti o n sys tem .In part i c- u l a r, re s o u r ces must be al l oc a t ed to e n su r e that the St a n d a rd s do not e x acerb a te the d i f feren ces in opport u n i ties to learn thatc u rrently exist b etween advantag ed and dis - advantag ed stud ents. LEARNING SCIENCE IS AN A C T I V E P RO C E S S . Learning science is something stud ents d o,not something that is d one to them. In learning science, students describ e objects and e vents,ask questions, acquire knowledge, construct explanations o fnatur - al phenomena, test those explanations in many diff erent wa ys,and c ommunicat e their ideas to othe rs. In the National Science E ducation Standards ,the t erm \"activ e process\"implies physical and mental a ctivity. Hands-o n activ ities not ha ve experiences. teaching must in volve stud ents in inquiry- oriented investigations in which they int er- act with their tea chers and p eers.Stud ents establish c onnections b etween their cur rent knowledge o fscience and the scientific knowledge found in many sour ces;they apply science c ontent to new questions; they engage in p roblem , exp erience assessments that are c onsis- tent with an a ctive approac h to learning . Emphasizing a ctive science learning means shifting emphasis away fr om tea chers presenting inf ormation and c over ing scienc e topics.

SCHOOL SCIENCE REFLECTS THE INTEL- L E C T U AL AND CUL T U R AL T RA D I T I O N S T H A T CHARACTERIZE THE PRACTICE OF CO N T E M P O RA R Y SCIENCE. To develop a ri ch know l ed ge of s c i en c e and the nat u ra l worl d ,s tu d ents must become familiar w i t h m odes of s c i en t ific inq u i ry, rules of evi- den ce , w ays of form u l a ting q u e s ti on s , a n d w ays of proposing e x p l a n a ti on s . The re l a- ti on of s c i en c e to mathe m a tics and to tech- n o l o gy and an understanding of the nat u re ofs c i en c e should also be part of t h eir edu- c a ti on . An explicit goal of the Na tional Sc i en ce Edu c a tion S t a n d a rd s is to establish high l evels of s c i en t ific literacy in the U n i ted S t a te s . An esse n tial aspect of s c i en t ific liter- acy is gr e a ter know l ed ge and under s t a n d - ing of s c i en c e su bj e ct matter, that is, t h e k n owl ed ge spe c i f i c a l ly asso c i a ted with the phys i c a l , l i fe , and earth scie n ce s . S c i en ti f i c l i teracy also incl u des understanding the n a tu r e of s c i en ce , the scie n tific e n terpr i s e , and the role of s c i en c e in so c i ety and per- s onal lif e .The St a n d a rd s recog n i ze that m a n y indiv i duals have co n tri buted to thetrad i ti o ns of s c i en c e and that, in histor i c a l pers pectiv e ,s c i en c e has been pract i ced in m a n y different cult u re s . S c i en c e is a way of k n owing that is c h a r- acter i zed by e m p i r ical cr i teri a ,l ogical argu- m en t , and skeptical rev i ew.S tu d en t s should deve l op an understanding of w h a t s c i en c e is, what scie n ce is not, what scie n ce can and cannot do, and how scie n ce con- tri butes to cult u re . I M P R OVING SCIENCE EDUCATION IS PA RT OF SYSTEMIC EDUCA T I O N R E F O R M . National g oals and standards contribute to state and local syst emic initia - tives,and the national and local r eform efforts complement ea ch othe r. Within the larger education syst em,we can view scienc e education as a subsyst em with both shar ed and unique c omponents. The components include stud ents and tea chers;schools with principals, superintendents,and school boards; teacher e ducation p rograms in col - leges and uni versities; textbooks and t ext- book publishe rs;communities o fparents and o fstud and indust and le gislators.The National Scienc e Education Standards prov ide the unity o f purpose and vision r equired to f ocus all o f those c omponents eff ectivel y on the imp or- tant task o fimproving science e ducation f or all stud ents,suppl ying a c onsist ency that is needed for the long-t erm changes r equired.See definition of science literac yStudents should de velop an unde rstanding o f what s cience is, what s cience is not, what s cience can and cannot do ,and how s cience contributes to culture.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

SCIENTIFIC LITERA C Y.Scientific lit eracy c p rocesses r equired for personal d ecision making ,participation in civic and cultural affairs, and e conomic p ro- ductivity. It also inc ludes sp ecific t ypes of abilities. In the National Science E ducation Standards ,the c ontent standards d efine sci - entific lit eracy. Scientific lit eracy means that a p erson can ask, find, or determine answ ers to questions derive d from curiosity about e veryday exp e- riences. It means that a p erson has the abili - ty to describe, explain,and p redict natural phenomena. Scientific lit eracy entails b eing able to read with und erstanding ar ticles about science in the p opular p ress and t o engage in social c onver sation about the validity o fthe c onclusions. Scientific lit eracy implies that a p erson can id entify scientific issues und erlying national and local d eci- sions and exp ress inf ormed.A citiz en should e valuate the quality o fscientific inf ormation on the basis ofits sour ce and the methods used to g ener- ate it. Scientific lit eracy also implies the capacity to pose and e valuate arguments based on e vidence and to apply c onclusions from such arguments ap propr iately. Individuals will display their scientific lit - eracy in diff erent wa ys,such as indi often ha diff erences in lit eracy in dif - ferent domains, such as mo re und erstanding oflife-science c oncepts and w ords,and less understanding o f phy sical-science c oncepts and w ords. Scientific lit eracy has diff erent degrees and f orms;it expands and d eepe ns over a lifetime, not just during the years in school. But the attitudes and values establishe d toward science in the ear ly years will shape a person's development o fscientific lit eracy as an adult. CONTENT AND CURRICUL U M .

K N O WLEDGE AND UNDERST A N D I N G . Implementing the National Scienc e Education Standards implies the a cquisitio n ofscientific kno wledge and the d edge r efers to fa cts,concepts,principles, laws,theories,and mo dels and can b e acquired in many wa ys.Understanding sci - ence r equires that an indi vidual st ructure o fmany ofknowl- including the ideas o fscience, rela- tionships b etween ideas, reasons f or these relationships, ways to use the ideas t o explain and p redict other natural phenome - na,and wa ys to apply them to many e vents. Understanding enc ompasses the ability t o use kno wledge, and it entails the ability t o distinguish b etween what is and what is not a scientific idea. Deve loping und erstandingpresup poses that stud ents are a ctively engag ed with the ideas o fscience and ha ve many exp eriences with the natural w orld. I N QU I R Y.Scientific inquiry r efers to the diverse wa ys in which scientists study the natural w orld and p ropose explanations based on the e vidence d erive d from their work.Inquiry also r efers to the a ctivities o f students in which they d evelop kno wledge and und erstanding o fscientific ideas, as well as an und erstanding o fhow scientists stud y the natural w orld. Inquiry is a multifa ceted activity that involves making obse rvations; posing ques - tions; examining b ooks and other sour ces of information to see what is alrea dy kno wn; planning in vestigations; reviewing what is alrea dy kno wn in light o f experimental e dence; t ools and redictions; c ommunicating the results. Inquiry r equires id entification o f assump tions, use o fcritical thinking ,and onsideration o falternative explanations.Stud ents will engage in sele ct- ed asp ects ofinquiry as they learn the scie n- tific way o fknowing the natural w orld,but they also should d evelop the capacity t o conduct c omple te inquiries. Although the Standards emphasiz e inquir y,this should not be int erprete d as recommending a single ap proac h to scienc e teaching . Teachers should use kno wledge, under- standings, and abilities describ ed in the c on- tent standards. Conduc ting hands-on sci - ence a ctivities d oes not guarant ee inquir y, nor is reading about science inc ompatible with inquir y. Attaining the und erstanding s and abilities describ ed in Chap ter 6 cannotScientific lit eracy implies that a p erson can identify s cientific issues unde rlying national and local decisions and e xpress positions that are s cientifical ly and technological ly informed.See Con tent Standards A & G (all grade le vels) See Teaching Standard BCopyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

D EV E L OP A FR A M E WORK OF Y E A R - LONG AND SHORT-TERM GOALS FOR S T U D E N TS . All teachers know that plan - ning is a critical c omponent o f effective teaching .One imp ortant asp ect ofplanning is setting g oals.In the vision o fscience e du- cation describ the Standards , teachers ofscience take resp onsibility f or setting yearlong and sho rt-term goals;in doing so , they adapt school and dist rict p rogr am goals,as well as state and national g oals,to the exp eriences and int erests o ftheir st u- dents indi vidual ly and as a g roup. Once tea chers have devised a frame work of go als,plans r emain flexible. Decisions ar e visited and r evisited in the light o f experi- ence. Teaching f or und erstanding r equires responsiveness to stud ents,so activities and strategies are c ontinuously adap ted and refined to address t opics arising fr om st u- dent inquiries and exp eriences, as well as school, communit y,and national e vents.Teachers also change their plans based o n the assessment and anal ysis o fstud ent achievement and the p and beliefs stud ents ha ve demonst rated.Thus, an inquiry might be ext ended because it sparks the int erest o fstudents,an activity might be add ed because a par ticular c on- cept has not b een und erstood,or mo re group w ork might be inc orpor ated into the plan to encourage c ommunication. A chal - lenge to tea chers ofscience is to balance and integrate immediate ne eds with the int en- tions o fthe yearlong frame work of goals. During planning , goals are t ranslat ed int o a cur riculum o fspecific t opics, units,and sequenc ed activities that stud ents mak e sense o ftheir w orld and und erstand the fundamental ideas o fscience. The content standards,as w ell as state,dist rict,and school frame works,prov ide guides f or teachers as they sele ct specific science t opics. Some frame works allow tea chers choices in deter mining t opics, sequences, activ ities, mat erials. Others mandate g oals,objec- tives,content,and mat erials. In either case, teachers examine the ext ent to which a cur - riculum inc ludes inquiry and dir ect exp eri- mentation as methods f or developing understanding . In planning and choosing curricula, teachers strive to balance b readth of to pics with d epth ofunderstanding .

Teachers also c onsider their o wn strengths and int erests and tak e into a ccount a vailable resour ces in the local environment. For example,in Cle veland, the study o fLake Erie, its pol lution,and cleanup is an imp ortant part o fa scienc e curriculum,as is the study o fearthquakes in the Los Angeles area.

Teachers ofscience int egrate a sound mo del of teaching and learning , a pract ical st ructure f or the se quence o f activ- ities, and the c ontent to be learned.

As mo re complex t opics are addressed, stud ents cannot alwa ys return to basic phe - nomena f or every conceptual und erstand - ing. Never theless, teachers can take an inquiry ap proac h as they guide stud ents in acquiring and int erpret ing inf ormatio n from sour ces such as lib raries, gover nment documents, and c ompu rely on tea chers, texts,and se condary sour ces\u2014such as vid eo, film, and c ompu ter simulations.

The plans o f teachers provide o pport uni- ties for all stud ents to learn science. Therefor e,planning is hea vily the tea cher's awar eness and und erstanding ofthe di verse abilities, interests, and cultural backgrounds o fstud ents in the classr oom. Planning also takes into a ccount the social structure o fthe classr oom and the chal - lenges posed by di verse stud ent groups.

Pre mature int ervention d epriv es stu- dents o fthe o pport unity to c onfront prob- lems and find sol utions, but intervention that o ccurs t oo late risks stud ent frust ration. Teachers also must d ecide when to challeng e stud ents to make ftheir exp eriences: At these p oints,stud ents should be ask ed to explain, clarify ,and critical ly examine and assess their w ork. O RC H E S T R ATE DISCOURSE AMONG S T U D E N T S ABOUT SCIENTIFIC IDEAS. An imp ortant stage o finquiry and o fstu- dent science learning is the o ral and w ritten discourse that f ocuses the att ention o fstu- dents on how they know what they kno w and how their kno wledge c onnects to larg er ideas, other w orld beyond the classr oom.Teachers dir ectly sup port and guide this discourse in two wa ys:They require stud ents to r ecord their w ork\u2014 teaching the ne cessary skills as ap propri- ate\u2014and they p romote many diff erent forms o communication (f or example, spo- mathemat i- cal,and ele ctronic).

The tea cher's role in thesesmall and larg er group int eract ions is to lis - ten,encourage b road par ticipation, and judge how to guide discussion\u2014d etermin- ing ideas to follo w,ideas to question, infor- mation to p rovide,and c onnections t o make. In the hands o fa skilled tea cher, such group w ork leads stud ents to r ecog nize the expertise that b ring to ea ch endea vor and the greater value o f evidence and argument o ver personality and st yle. CHALLENGE STUDENTS TO AC C E P T AND SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN LEARNING. Teachers mak e it clear that ea ch stud ent must take resp on- sibility f or his or her w ork.The tea cher also creates o pport unities f or stud ents to tak e responsibility f or their o wn learning ,indi- vidual ly and as memb ers of groups. Teachers do so by sup porting stud ent ideas and questions and by encouraging stud ents to pur sue them. Teachers give indi vidual stud ents a ctive roles in the design and implementation o finvestigations, in the preparation and p resentation o fstud ent work to their p eers,and in stud ent assess - ment o ftheir o wn work. R E C OGNIZE AND RESPOND TO STU- DENT DIVERSITY AND ENC O U R AG E ALL STUDENTS TO P A RT I C I P ATE FULLY IN SCIENCE LEARNING. In all asp ects of science learning as e nvisioned by the Standards ,skilled tea chers recog nize the diversity in their classes and organize the classr oom so that all stud ents ha ve the opport unity to par ticipate ful ly.

This monit oring can b e particular ly imp ortant in classes o fdiverse stud ents,where social issues o fstatus and autho be a fa ctor. Teachers ofscience o rchestrate their class - es so that all stud ents ha ve equal o pport uni- ties to par ticipate in learning a ctivities. Stud ents with p hysical disabilities might require modified e quipment; students with limit ed English ability might be encourag ed to use their o wn language as w ell as English and to use f orms o f presenting data such as pictures and g raphs that r equire less lan - guage p roficiency ;stud ents with learning disabilities might ne ed mo re time to c om- plete science a ctivities. E N CO U R AGE AND MODEL THE SKILLS OF SCIENTIFIC INQ U I R Y, AS WELL AS THE CURIOSITY, O PENNESS TO NEW I D E A S , AND SKEPTICISM T H A T CHAR- ACTERIZE SCIENCE. Implementing the recommendations ab ove requires a range o f actions based on car eful assessments o fstu- dents,knowledge o fscience, and a ching st rategies.One aspect ofthe tea cher's role is less tangible: teachers are mo dels for the stud ents the y teach.A tea cher who engages in inquir y with stud ents mo dels the skills ne eded forinquir y. Teachers who exhibit enthusiasm and int erest and who speak to the p ower and beau ty ofscientific und erstanding instill in their stud ents some o fthose same attitudes t oward science. Teachers whose actions d emonst rate resp ect for diff ering ideas, attitudes, and values sup port a disp o- sition fundamental to science and to scienc e classr ooms that also is imp ortant in man y every day situations. The ability o f teachers to do all that is required by Standard B r equires a so phisti- cated set o f judgments about science,st u- dents,learning ,and tea ching . To develop these judgments, successful tea chers must have the o pport unity to w ork with col - leagues to discuss, share, and increase their knowledge. They are also mo re likely to suc - ceed ifthe fundamental b eliefs about st u- dents and about learning are shar ed across their school c ommunity in all learning domains. Successful implementation o fthis vision o fscience tea ching and learning also requires that the school and dist rict p rovide the ne cessary resour ap propr iate sche d- ules. For example, class p eriods must b e long enough to enable the t ype ofinquir y teaching describ ed here to be a chieved.

The school scienc e progr am must ext end b eyond the walls o f the school to the resour ces ofthe c ommuni - ty.Our natio n's communities ha ve man y specialists, including those in t ransp orta- , mechanics, and many other fields that ha ve scientific asp ects.Specialists oft en are a vail- able as resour ces for classes and f or indi vid- ual stud ents.Many c ommunities ha ve access to science c enters and museums,as w ell as to the science c ommunities in higher e duca- tion, national lab oratories,and indust ry; these can c ontribute greatly to the und er- standing o fscience and encourage stud ents to further their int erests o fschool. In addition,the p hysical e nvironment inand around the school can be used as a li v- ing lab oratory for the study o fnatural phe - nomena. Whether the school is locat ed in a densely populat ed urban area, a sprawling subur b,a small t own,or a rural area, the environment can and should be used as a resour ce for science stud y. Wor king with othe rs in their school and with the c ommu- nity, teachers build these resour ces into their work with stud ents. E N G A GE STUDENTS IN DESIGNING T H E LEARNING ENVIR O N M E N T .As part o f challenging stud ents to take resp onsibilit y for their learning , teachers involve them in the design and manag ement o fthe learning environment. Even the youngest stud ents can and should par ticipate in discussions and d ecisions about using time and spa ce for work.With this sharing c omes resp or care o fspace and resour ces.As stu- dents pur sue their inquiries, they ne ed access to resour ces and a v oice in d etermin- ing what is ne eded.The mo re ind ependently stud ents can a ccess what they ne ed,the more they can take resp onsibility f or their own work.Stud ents are also in valuable in identifying resour ces beyond the school.

That wint er, when the end o fthe sound study near ed, Ms.R.was rea dy with a new culminating activ ity\u2014making musical inst ruments. She posed a question to the entire class: Having studied sound f or almost 6 w eeks, could they design and make musical inst ruments that would p roduce sounds f ment? Ms.R. had colle cted a varie ty of materials, which she now displa yed on a table, including b oxes,tubes, string, wire, hooks, scrap w ood,dowe ls,plastic, rubber, fabric,and mo re.The stud ents had b een working in g roups o f four during the sound stud y,and Ms. R.ask ed them to gather int o those g roups to think about the kinds o f instruments they would like to make. Ms.R. asked the stud ents to think par ticular ly about what they knew about sound, what kind o fsound they would like their inst ru- ments to make, and what kind o finstru- ment it would be. How would the sound b e prod uced? What would make the sound? She sug gested they might want to look at the mat erials she had b rought in, but the y could think about other mat erials t oo.

The und er- standing and abilities r equired to be a mas - terful tea cher o fscience are not static. Science c ontent increases and changes, and a teacher's und erstanding in science must keep pace.Knowledge about the p rocess o f learning is also c ontinual ly developing , requiring that tea chers remain inf ormed. Furthe r, we live in an e ver-changing socie ty, which d eeply influences e vents in schools; social changes aff ect stud ents as they c ome to school and aff ect what they ne ed to car ry away with them. In addition, teachers must be involved in the d evelopment and r efine- ment o fnew ap proac hes to tea ching ,assess - ment,and cur riculum. Teachers ofscience build skills g radually, starting in their und ergraduate years, where they engage in science and gain some exp e- rience in tea ching . They then exp erience the realities o ftheir first years in the classr oom, work with other tea chers,take a dvantage o f professional d evelopment off erings, and learn fr om their o wn eff orts and those o ftheir colleagues.

Continuous p rofessional d evelopment requires a g radual shift fr om campus t o school, acco mpanied by collab oration among all rofessional deve lopment a ctivities.

K N O WLEDGE AND UNDERST A N D I N G OF SCIENCE One o fthe most se rious questions in scienc e education is what science a tea cher ne eds to know. W hat d oes it mean to know a lot or a little, have a sound foundation, and ha ve in- depth und erstanding? The crit eria ofcredithours that states, professional organizations, and higher e ducation instit utions use t o prescribe c ontent requirements are ina de- quate indicat ors of what is learned in a course. Therefor e,the follo wing discussio n focuses on the nature o fthe o pport unities to learn science ne eded by tea chers,rather than on cr edit hours. It is assumed that teachers ofscience will c ontinue to lear n science throughout their car eers. T o meet the St a n d a rd s ,a ll te ach ers of s c i- en ce must have a stro n g, broad base of s c i en- tific know l ed ge ex ten s ive en o u g h for them to nUnderstand the nature o fscientific inquir y,its central role in science, and how to use the skills and p rocesses o fsci- entific inquir y. nUnderstand the fundamental fa cts and concepts in major science disciplines. nBe able to make c onceptual c onnections within and across science disciplines, as well as to mathematics, technolo gy,and other school subje cts. nUse scientific und erstanding and abilit y when dealing with p ersonal and societal issues. Beyo nd the firm foundation p rovided by the content standards in Chap ter 6,how muc h more science a tea cher ne eds to know f or a given level ofschooling is an issue o f breadth v ersus depth to be d ebated and decided local ly while resp ecting the int ent of the Standards . Breadth implies a f ocus on the basic ideas ofscience and is c entral to tea ching scienc e at all g rade levels.Depth refers to kno wing and und erstanding not only the basic ideas within a science discipline, but also some o f the sup port ing exp erimental and the oretical knowledge.

The d epth of understanding o fscience c ontent required varies a ccording to the g rade level of teach- ing resp onsibilit y. Teachers of grad es K-4 usual ly are g ener- alists who tea ch most, ifnot all, school sub - jects.A p rimary task f or these tea chers is t o lay the exp eriential, conceptual,and attit u- dinal foundation f or future learning in sci - ence by guiding stud ents through a range o f inquiry a ctivities. To achieve this, eleme n- tary tea chers ofscience ne ed to ha ve the opport unity to d evelop a b road kno wledge ofscience c ontent in addition to some in- depth exp eriences in an und erstanding ofinquiry to guide stud ent inquiries, appraise cur rent stud ent und erstanding ,and further stud ents'understanding o fscientific ideas. Although tho rough science kno wledge in many areas would enhance the w ork of an elementary tea cher,it is mo re realistic t o expect a g eneralist's kno wledge. Science cur ricula are organiz ed in man y different wa ys in the middle g rades.Scienc e experiences go into g reater depth,are mo re quantitat ive,require mo re sophisticat ed rea -soning skills, and use mo re sophisticat ed apparatus and t echnolo gy.

LEARNING Prospectiv and p much o ftheir ormal scienc e knowledge through course work in colle ges and uni versities. For all tea chers,undergrad- uate science courses are a major fa ctor in defining what science c ontent is learned. Those courses also p rovide mo dels for how science should be taught.

In the vision describ ed by the Standards, all prospectiv e and p racticing tea chers who study science par ticipate in guid ed activities that help them make sense o fthe new c on- tent being learned, whether it c omes by le c- ture, reading ,small-g roup discussion, or laboratory investigation. Courses and ities inc lude ong oing o pport unities f or teachers to r eflect on the p rocess and the outcomes o ftheir learning . Instructors help teachers und erstand the nature o flearning science as they d evelop new c oncepts and skills. Those who tea ch science must b e attentive to the scientific ideas that tea chers bring with them, prov ide time f or learning experiences to be shar ed,and be kno wledge- able about st rategies that p romote and encourage r eflection.

Is this cur riculum unit ap propr iate for this group ofthird-g rade students? Does a par ticular study allow students sufficient opportunity to de vise their o wn experiments? Are all students par ticipating equal ly? Assessment is an imp ortant t ool for good inquiry into tea ching . In the daily o beliefs,and reasoning .Effective teachers are kno wledgeable about the var i- ous e ducational pur poses f or assessment and know how to implement and int erpre t a variety ofassessment st rategies. Skilled tea chers ofscience also know ho w to create and manage the p hysical, social, and int ellectual e nvironment in a classr oom community o fscience rs.LEARNING T ofsci- ence ha ve the o pport unity to b ring t ogether the kno wledge describ ed ab ove and d evelop an int egrated view o f what it means to tea ch and learn science. The tea ching standards in Chapter 3 are designed to guide tea chers' decisions about ea ch ofthe c omplex a ctivi- ties in volved in tea ching science. In the vision describ ed by the Standards , teachers also d evelop c oncepts and language t o engage in discourse with their p eers abou t content,curriculum, teaching ,learning ontent knowledge by tea chers mir rors what w e know about learning by stud ents;it can b e fully developed only through c ontinuous experience. But exp erience is not sufficient. Teachers also must ha ve opport unities t o engage wledge\u2014 science, learning ,and p edagogy\u2014and mak e connections b etween them. In this vision, people resp onsible f or pro- fessional d evelopment w ork together with each other and with tea chers as they int e- grate their kno wledge and exp eriences. For example,higher e ducation science and e du- cation faculty must learn to w ork together: An inst ructor in a uni versity science course might in vite a memb er ofthe science e duca- tion faculty to par ticipate in r egular discus - sion time designed to help stud ents r eflect on how they came to learn science c oncepts. Not only must the d epartments in highe r education instit utions w ork together, but schools and higher e ducation instit utions must ent er into t rue collab oration. And Teache rs use their kno wledge o f learning to make effec tive decisions about learning o bjectives,teaching strategies,assessment tasks, and curriculum mat erials.

The standards describe the quality o fassessment pract ices used by tea chers and stat e and f eder al ag encies to measure stud ent achievement and the o pport unity prov ided stud ents to learn science. By identifying essential char acter istics o f exemplary assessment p ractices, the standards se rve as guides f or develop- ing assessment tasks, pract ices, and policies. These standards can be applie d equally to the assessment o fstud ents,teachers,and p rograms; to summat ive and f ormative assessment p ractices; and to classr oom assessments as w ell as large-scale, external assessments. This chap ter begins with an int roduc- tion that describes the c omponents o fthe assessment p rocess and a c on- temporary view o fmeasur ement the ory and p ractice.This int roduction Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In the vision describ ed by the National Science E ducation Standards ,assessment is a primary f eedback me chanism in the scienc e education syst em.For assessment data p rovide stud ents with f eedback on ho w well they are me eting the exp ectations o f their tea chers and par ents,teachers with feedback on how w ell their stud ents ar e learning ,districts with f eedback on the effective ness o ftheir tea chers and p rograms, and policy mak ers with f eedback on ho w well policies are w orking . Fee dback leads t o changes in the science e ducation syst em by stimulating changes in policy ,guiding teacher p rofessional d evelopment, and encouraging stud ents to imp rove their understanding o fscience. The assessment p rocess is an eff ectiv e tool for communicating the exp ectations o fthe science e ducation syst em to all c oncerned with science e ducation. Assessment p ractices and policies p rovide o perational d efinitions of w hat is imp ortant. For example, the use ofan ext ended inquiry f or an assessment task signals what stud ents are to learn, howteachers are to tea ch,and whe re resour ces are to be a and int er- pretation o f educational data. The four components o fthe assessment p rocess ar e detailed in Figure 5.1. As scie n ce edu c a tors are c h a n g ing the way t h ey think ab o ut good scie n ce edu c a ti on , edu c a ti o nal meas u rem ent specialists are ack n owl ed ging c h a n g e as wel l .Recog n i ti o n of the impor t a n ce ofa s s e s s m e nt to co n tem- pora ry edu c a ti o nal reform has catal y zed re s e a r ch ,deve l opm en t , and imple m en t a ti o n ofn ew me t h ods of data c o ll ecti on alo n g with new ways of j u d ging data q u a l i t y.

In this new vie w,assessment and learning are two sides o fthe same c oin.The methods used to colle ct educational data d efine in measurable t erms what tea chers should teach and what stud ents should learn. And when stud ents engage in an assessment exercise, they should learn fr om it. This view o fassessment pla ces greater confidence in the results o fassessment p ro- cedures that sample an asso rtment o f vari- ables using di verse data-colle ction methods, rather than the mo re traditional sampling o f one variable by a single method. Thus,all aspects ofscience a chievement\u2014ability t o inquire, scientific und erstanding o fthe nat - ural w orld,understanding o fthe nature and utility o fscience\u2014are measur ed using mul - tiple methods such as p erfor mances and portf olios, well as c onve ntional pap er- and-p encil tests.

Stud ent achievement can be int erprete d only in light o fthe quali - ty ofthe p rograms they ha ve erienced. Another imp ortant shift is t oward \"authentic assessment. \" This mo vement calls for exercises that close ly approximate the intended ou tcomes o fscience e ducation. Authentic assessment e xercises r equire st u- dents to apply scientific kno wledge and rea - soning to situations similar to those the y will encount er in the w orld outside the classr oom,as well as to situations that approximate how scientists do their w ork.

An imp ortant assump tion und erlying the assessment standards is that states and local districts can d evelop me chanisms to mea - sure stud ents' achievement as sp ecified in the c ontent standards and to measure the opport unities f or learning science as sp eci- fied in the p rogram and syst em standards. If the p rinciples in the assessment standards are follo wed,the inf ormation resulting fr om new mo des ofassessment applied local ly can ha ve common meaning and value in terms o fthe national standards, despite the use o fdifferent assessment p roced ures and instruments in diff erent locales. This c on- trasts with the t o for only when they are based on paralle l forms o fthe same test.The S t a n d a r ds ASSESSMENT STANDARD A: As s e s s m e n ts must be c o n s i s te n t with the decisions they are designed to inf o rm . nAssessments are deliber ately designed . nThe relationship bet ween the deci - sions and the data is clear . nAssessment pr ocedures ar e internally consisten t.

E QUAL ATTENTION MUST BE GIVEN TO THE ASSESSMENT OF OPPOR T U N I T Y TO LEARN AND TO THE ASSESSMENT OF STUDENT A C H I EV E M E N T .Stud ents cannot be held a ccountable f or achievement unless they are g iven adequate o pport unity to learn science. Therefor e,achievement and opport unity to learn science must b e assessed e qually. ASSESSMENT STANDARD C: The t e c h n i c al quality of the da t a co l l e c ted is well matched to the decisions and actions taken on the basis of their int e rp re t at i o n . nThe feature that is claimed to b e measured is actually measured . nAssessment tasks are authentic . nAn individual studen t's per formanc e is similar on t wo or more tasks tha t claim to measure the same aspect of student achie vemen t. nStudents ha ve adequa ate their achie vements . nAssessment tasks and methods of pr e- senting them pr ovide data that ar e sufficiently stable to lead to the same decisions if used at different times . Standard C addresses the d egree to whic h the data colle cted war rant the d ecisions and actions that will be based on them. The quality o fthe d ecisions and the ap propr iate- ness o f resulting a ction are limit ed by the quality o fthe data. The mo re serious the consequences f or stud ents or tea chers,thegreater confidence those making the d eci- sions must ha ve in the t echnical quality o f the data. Confidence is gaug ed by the quali - ty ofthe assessment p and the c onsis- tency o fthe measur ement o ver alternative assessment p rocesses. Judgments about c on- fidence are based on se veral diff erent indica - tors,some o f which are discussed b elow. THE FEATURE T H A T IS CLAIMED TO BE MEASURED IS A C T UA L L Y MEASURED. The co n tent and form of an assessment task must be co n gru ent with what is s u ppo s ed to be meas u red .This is \" va l i d i t y. \" For instanc e , i fan assessment claims to meas u re stu den t s' a bi l i t y to frame q u e s ti o ns for co n du c ting sci- en tific inq u i ry and to d e s i gn an inq u i ry to ad d ress the q u e s ti on s , a shor t - a n s w er for m a t would not be an appropr i a te task. Req u i ri n g s tu dents to pose q u e s ti o ns and d e s i gn i n qu i r ies to a d d ress them would be an a ppropr i a te task. However, i fthe purpose of an assessment task is to meas u re stu den t s' k n owl ed ge of the c h a racter i s tics that dist i n- guish groups of m i n e ra l s ,a mu l ti p l e - ch oi c e format might be s u i t a b le as well as e f f i c i en t . ASSESSMENT TASKS ARE A U T H E N T I C . When stud ents are engag ed in assessment tasks that are similar in f orm to tasks in which they will engage in their li ves outsid e the classr oom or are similar to the a ctivities ofscientists, great c onfidence can b e attached to the data colle cted.Such assess - ment tasks are authentic.See P rogram Standard E and System Standard E The cont ent and form o fan assessment task must be cong ruent with what is s u ppo sed to be meas u red .Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The relationship o fsome o f those f orms o fassessment tasks to the g oals ofscience e ducation are not as o bvious as othe rs.For instance, a stud ent's ability t o obtain and e valuate scientific inf ormatio n might be measur ed using a sho rt-answ er test to id entify the sour ces ofhigh-qualit y scientific inf ormation about t oxic waste. An alternative and mo re authentic method is t o ask the stud ent to locate such inf ormatio n and d evelop an annotat ed biblio graphy and a judgment about the scientific quality o f the inf ormation. AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT'S P E R F O R - MANCE IS SIMILAR ON TWO OR MORE TASKS T H A T CLAIM TO MEASURE T H E SAME ASPECT OF STUDENT A C H I EV E - M E N T .This is one asp ect of reliabilit y. Suppose that the pur pose o fan assessment is to measure a stud ent's ability to pose appropr iate questions.A stud ent might b e asked to pose questions in a situation set in the p hysical sciences. The stud ent's perfor- mance and the task are c onsist ent if the p er- formance is the same when the task is set in the c ontext ofthe life sciences, assuming the stud ent has had e qual o pport unities to lear n physical and life sciences. S T U D E N T S HAVE ADEQUATE OPPOR- TUNITIES TO DEMONSTRATE T H E I R AC H I EV E M E N TS . For decision mak ers to have confidence in assessment data, they need assurance that stud ents ha ve had theopport unity to d emonst rate their ful l understanding and abilit y. Assessment tasks must be d evelopmental ly appropr iate, must be set in c ontexts that are familiar to the students,must not r equire reading skills o r vocabulary that are inap propr iate to the st u- dents' grad e level,and must be as fr ee from bias as possible. ASSESSMENT TASKS AND THE METH- ODS OF PRESENTING THEM PRO V I D E D ATA T H A T ARE SUFFICIENTLY ST A B L E TO LEAD TO THE SAME DECISIONS IF USED AT DIFFERENT T I M E S . This is another asp ect of reliabilit y,and is esp ecially important f or large-scale assessments, where changes in p erfor mance o f groups is o f interest.Only with stable measures can valid inferences about changes in g roup p erfor- mance be ma de. Although the c onfidence indicat ors dis - cussed ab ove focus on stud ent achievement data, an analo gous set o f confidence indica - tors can be g enerated for opport unity t o learn. For instance, teacher quality is an indicat or of opport unity to learn. Authenticity is o btained if teacher quality is measur ed by syst ematic rvation d observers.Confidence in the measure isSee Teaching Standard CAssessment tasks must b e developmental ly appropr iate, must be set in cont exts that are familiar to the students, must not require reading skills or vocabulary that are inap propr iate to the students ' grade le vel,and must be as free from bias as possible.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

The choice among them is usual ly constrained by t radeo ffs between the t ype, qualit y,and amount o finformation gained, and the time and resour ces ea ch requires. However, t o serve the int ended pur pose, the choice o fassessment f orm should be c onsis- tent with what one wants to measure and t o infer. It is critical that the data and their method o f collection yield inf ormation with confidence le vels consist ent with the c onse- quences o fits use. Public c onfidence in e du- cational data and their use is r elated to t ech- nical qualit y. This public c onfidence is infl u- enced by the ext ent to which t echnical qual - ity has b een considered by e ducators and policy mak ers and the skill with which the y communicate with the public about it. ASSESSMENT STANDARD D: As s e s s m e n t pr a ct i c es must be fair. nAssessment tasks must be r eviewed for the use of stereotypes , for assump - tions that reflect the perspectives or experiences of a particular group , for language that might be offensive to a particular group ,and for other fea - tures that might distract students from the in tended task.nLarge-scale assessments must use sta - tistical techniques to identify poten - tial bias among subgroups . nAssessment tasks must be appropr i- ately modified to accommoda te the needs of students with ph ysical dis - abilities ,learning disabilities ,or limit - ed English proficienc y. nAssessment tasks must be set in a variety of con texts, be engaging t o students with different in terests and experiences ,and must not assume the perspective or experience of a particu - lar gender , racial,or ethnic group . A premise o fthe National Science E ducation Standards is that all stud ents should ha ve access to quality science e ducation and should be exp ected to a chieve scientific lit - eracy as d efined by the c ontent standards. It follows that the p rocesses used to assess st u- dent achievement must be fair to all st u- dents.This is not only an ethical r equire- ment b ut also a measur ement r equirement. Ifassessment results are mo re close ly related to gender or ethnicity than to the p repara- tion r eceive d or the science und erstanding and ability b eing assessed, the validity o fthe assessment p rocess is questionable. ASSESSMENT TASKS MUST BE R EV I E WED FOR THE USE OF STEREO- TY PE S , FOR ASSUMPTIONS T H A T REFLECT THE P E R S P ECTIVES OR EXPE- RIENCES OF A P A RT I C U L AR GR O U P , FOR L A N G U AGE T H A T MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE TO A P A RT I C U L AR GR O U P , AND FOR OTHER FEATURES T H A T MIGHT DISTRACT STUDENTS FR O M THE INTENDED T A S K .

The requirement that assessment e xercises be authentic and thus in c ontext increases the lik elihood that all tasks ha ve some degre e of bias for some p opulation o fstu- dents.Some c ontexts will ha ve mo re appeal to males and othe rs to f emales. If,however, assessments employ a varie ty oftasks,the collection will b e \"eq ually unfair\" to all. This is one way in which the d eleterious eff ects of bias can be a voided.

Thus,in developing plans f or assessment st rategies to c ompile evidence o fstudent achievement, teachers demonst rate that alt ernative forms o fdata collection and methods o finterpret ing the m are as valid and r eliable as the familiar short-answ er test. The pur porte d objectivity o fshort- answ er tests is so highly valued that ne wer modes ofassessment such as p ortfolios, per- formances,and essa ys ly mo re subje ctive scoring methods are less trusted by p eople who are not p rofessional educators.Overco ming this la ck of trust requires that tea chers use assessment plans for monit oring stud ent progress and f or grading .

The con- tent standards are stat ed in t erms o funder- standings and abilities; therefor e,the first example about und erstanding the natural world.This example r equires a b ody ofsci- entific kno wledge and the c ompetence t o reason with that inf ormation to make p re- dictions, to develop explanations, and to a ct in scientifical ly rational wa ys.The example focuses on p redictions and justifying those predictions. The se cond example is abou t the ability to inquire, which also r equires a body ofscientific inf ormation and the c om- petence to reason with it to c onceptualize, plan, and p erfor m in vestigations. (These assessment tasks and the c ontent standards do not ha ve a one-to-one c orrespondence.) ASSESSING UNDERSTANDING OF T H E N AT U R AL W O R L D The content standards call f or scientific understanding o fthe natural w orld.Such understanding r equires kno wing p hysical, life,and earth sciences,as w ell as ideas that are c ommon across the natural sciences. That und erstanding inc ludes the capacity t o reason with kno wledge. Discerning what a student kno ws or how the stud ent reasons is not possible without c ommunication, either verbal or r epresentational, a third essential component o funderstanding .In feren ces ab o ut stu den t s'u n ders t a n d i n g can be based on the analysis of t h eir perfor- m a n c es in the scie n ce cl a s s room and the i r work prod u ct s . Types of perfor m a n ce s i n clu de making class or public pr e s en t a ti on s , discussing scie n ce matters with peers or te ach ers ,and co n du c ting labor a tory wor k . Prod u cts of s tu dent work incl u de ex a m i n a - ti on s ,j o u r nal not e s ,wri t ten repor t s ,d i a - gra m s , data se t s ,physical and mathe m a ti c a l m odel s ,and c o ll ecti ons of n a tu r al ob j ect s . Com mu n i c a ti o n is fundamental to both per- form a n c e and prod u ct - b a s e d assessme n t s . Understanding takes diff sophistication.A p respiration might be quite diff erent fr om that o fa chemist, just as a c ell biolo gist's understanding o f respiration is quite diff er- ent fr om that o fa physician. The p hysicist, the chemist, the biolo gist,and the p hysician all ha ve a highly so phisticat ed und erstand - ing o f respiration. They b ring many o fthe same scientific p rinciples to bear on the concept.However, each is lik ely to g ive greater emphasis to c oncepts that ha ve spe- cial significance in their par ticular disci - pline.A p hysicist 's emphasis might be o n energ etics,with little emphasis on the organisms in which respiration takes pla ce. The p hysician, on the other hand, might emphasize respiration as it sp ecifical ly applies to humans. The context ofapplica - tion also c ontributes to diff erences in p er-Clear ly relating assessment tasks and prod ucts o fstudent work to the value d goals o f science e ducation is int egral to assessment plans.Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

However, even the citiz en's und erstanding will erience Legitimate diff erences in p erspectiv es and sophistication o funderstanding also will b e evident in ea ch stud ent's scientific und er- standing o fthe w orld.A challeng e to tea chers and othe rs resp onsible f or assessing und erstanding is to d ecide ho w such variability is t ranslat ed into judgments about the d egree to which indi vidual st u- dents or g roups o fthem und erstand the natural w orld.The example that follo ws illustrates how explanations o fthe natural world can be a rich sour ce ofinformatio n about how stud ents und erstand it. Because explanation is c entral to the sci - entific ent erprise,eliciting and analyzing explanations are useful wa ys ofassessing sci - ence a chievement. The example il lustrates how thoughtful ly designed assessment e xer- cises r equiring explanations p rovide st u- dents with the o pport unity to d emonst rate the full range o ftheir scientific und erstand - ing. Exer cises o fthis so rt are not designed t olearn whether a stud ent kno ws a par ticular fact or c oncept,but rather to tap the d epth and rt are difficult to desig n and are a challenge to sc ore.The example that follo ws illustrates these challenges.

D EV E LO P ING SCORING R U B R I C S . The proc ess o fscoring stud ent-generated expla r the d evelopment o fa scor- ing rub ric.The rub ric is a standard o f per- formance f or a d efined p opulation. Typical ly,scoring rub rics chers ofthe stud in the mance standard is deve through rocess calle d \"social mo deration. \" The st eps in designing a sc oring rub ric involve defining the p erfor mance standard f or the scientifi - cally literate a dult and then d eciding whic h elements o fthat standard are ap propr iate for stud ents in the targ et population. The draft p erfor mance standard is r efined b y subse quent stud ly,stud ent perfor mances resp ect ric are mances plary, or ina dequate. Differences in opinions about the rub ric and judgments about the quality o fstudents' responses are mo derated by a g roup o f teachers until c onsensus is reached f or the rub ric. Because a targ et population has not b een identified,and rub rics ne ed to func tion in the c ommunities that d evelop them, this section d oes not d efine a rub ric.Rather the steps in d eveloping a rub ric are describ ed. THE PERFORMANCE OF A SCIENTIFI- CA L L Y LITERATE ADULT. Deve loping a scoring rub ric begins with a descrip tion o f the p erfor mance standard f or scientifical ly literate a dults. That p erfor mance standard is deve loped by a rub ric development team. Members ofthe team w rite indi vidualresponses to the e xercise that r eflect how each believes a scientifical ly literate a dult should resp ond.They also seek resp onses from other a dults. Based on the indi vidual responses, the team ne gotiates a team response that se rves as the initial standard. The t e a m's standard is anal y zed into the com pon ents of the r e s pon s e . In the plant-in- a - jar exer c i s e , the co m pon ents are the pre d i c- ti on s , the infor m a ti o n used to j u s tify the pre- d i cti on s , the r e a s oning used to j u s tify pre d i c- ti on s , and the q u a l i t y of the co m mu n i c a ti on . Examples o f pre dictions fr om a scientifi - cally literate a dult about how long the plant can li ve in the jar might inc lude (1) insuffi - cient inf ormation to make a p rediction, (2) the plant can li ve ind efinitely, o r (3) inse cts or disease might kill the plant. Whatever the prediction, it should be justified. For exam - ple,ifthe asse rtion is ma de that the inf or- mation p rovided in the p rompt is insuffi - cient to make a p rediction, then the expla - nation should describe what inf ormation is needed to make a p rediction and how that information would be used. Scientifical ly literate a dults will r ely on a range o fknowledge to justify their p redic- tions. The standard resp onse d eveloped by the team o f teachers will inc lude c oncepts from the p hysical, life,and earth sciences, as well as unifying c oncepts in science. All are applicable to making and justifying a p re- diction about the life o fa plant in a jar , but because o fthe diff erences in emphasis, no one p erson would be exp ected to use all o f them.

Other c on- cepts are fr om life sciences, such as plant physiolo gy,plant g rowth,photosynthesis, respiration, plant diseases, and plant and insect interact ion.Still other c oncepts are from the earth sciences, such as soil t ypes, composition o fthe atmosphe re,water fying c oncepts might be used to p redict and justify a p rediction about the plant in the jar. Those might inc lude closed, open,and isolat ed r equired to p redict the life o fa plant in a jar is not be limit ed to single c oncepts.A d eepe r und erstanding o f the phenomena could be implied by a just i- fication that inc ludes kno wledge o f chemi - cal sp ecies and energ y. Kee ping t rack of energ y, of C6H12O6(sugar), CO2(carbon dioxide), H2O and o fmine rals requires kno wing about the changes they und ergo in the jar and abou t equilib ria among z ones in the jar (soil and atmosphe re).The jar and its c ontents f orm a closed syst em with resp ect to matt er but an o pen syst em with resp ect to energ y. The analysis o fthe life exp ectancy o fthe plant in the jar also r equires kno wing that the matt er in the jar changes f orm,but the mass remains c onstant. In addition, knowing that gases fr om the atmosphe re and mine rals inthe soil b ecome a part o fthe plant is imp or- tant to the explanation. A deepe r und erstanding o fscience might be inf erred from a p and - ry of and respir a- tion. Photosynthesis is a p rocess in whic h radiant energy o f visible light is c onverted into chemical b ond energy in the f orm of special car rier molecules, such as ATP, which in turn are used to st ore chemical b ond energy in car bohydrates. The process b egins with light abso rption by chlo rophyl l,a pig - ment that g ives plants their g reen colo r. In photosynthesis, light energy is used to dr ive the rea ction: Carbon dio xide + wat er\u00ddsugar + oxy gen. Respiration is a p rocess in which energy is released when chemical c ompounds rea ct with oxy gen.In respiration, sugars are b ro- ken down to p roduce useful chemical ene r- gy for the plant in the rea ction: Sugar + oxy gen\u00ddwater + carbon dio xide. Photosynthesis and respiration are c omple - mentary p rocesses, because photosynthesis results in the st orage o f energ y,and respir a- tion the atmosphe re;respiration adds CO2 to the atmosphe re. A justification f or a p rediction about the life o fthe plant in the jar might inc lude knowledge o f dynamic e quilib rium. Equilib rium exists b etween the liquid and vapor states o fwater. T he liquid wat er evap- orates c ontinuousl y. In the closed c ontaine r, at constant t emperature,the rate o f conden- sation e quals the rate o f evaporation.

S CORING RUBRICS FOR DIFFERENT P O P U L ATIONS OF STUDENT S .The plant-in-a-jar assessment e xercise is an appropr iate p rompt f or und erstanding plants at any g rade level.Deve lopment o f stud ents at diff erent o fthe could be exp to be based p rimarily on exp eri- ences with plants. Stud gy.A e xercise in the follo wing wa y: The plant c ould li ve.It has wat er and sunlight. It could die if it got frozen or a bug eats it. We planted seeds in third g rade. Some kids for got to water them and they died. Eddie g ot scar ed that his seeds w ould not g row. H e hid them in his desk.They did. The lea ves were yellow. After Eddie put it in the sun it g ot green.The plants in our terrarium li ve all year long.

Ideally,the 12th grade r would see the plant in a jar as a p hys- ical mo del ofthe Earth 's ecosyst em,and view photosynthesis and respiration as c om- plementary p rocesses. Setting a p erfor mance standard f or a population o fstud ents d epends on the p op- ulatio n's developmental le vel and their experiences with science. Considerations t o be ma de in using stud ent resp onses f or deve loping a rub ric can be il lustrated by discussing two justifications c onstructed by students who ha ve just c omple ted high- school biolo gy.Stud ent E has c onstructed an exemplary justification f or her p rediction about the plant in the jar .Stud ent S has constructed a less satisfa ctory resp onse b ut has the p oint. STUDENT E: Ifthere are no insects in the jar or mic roorganisms that might cause some plant disease,the plant might g row a bit and li ve for quite a while. I know that when I was in ele - mentary s chool we did this e xper iment. My plant died\u2014it g ot covere d with black mold. But some o fthe plants other kids had g ot big ger and lived for more than a year . The plant can li ve because it g ets ene rgy from the sunlight.When light shines on the lea ves, photosynthesis takes place. Carbon dio xide and water form carbo hydrates and oxy gen.This reaction t ransforms ene rgy from the sun int o chemical ene rgy. P lants can do this because the y have chlor ophyll. The plant needs carbo hydrates for life p rocesses like g rowing and mo ving.It uses the carbo hy- drates and oxy gen to p roduce ene rgy for lif e processes like g rowth and mo tion.Carbon dio x- ide is p roduced too.

For the plant t o grow it needs mine rals from the soil.When parts ofthe plant die, the plant mat erial rots and mine rals go back into the soil. So that 's why I think that how much the plant will g row wil l depend on the mine rals in the soil. The gases, oxygen,carbon dio xide and wat er vapor just keep g etting us ed over and o ver.What I'm not sure about is if the gases g et used up . Can the plant li ve ifthere is no carbon dio xide left for pho tosynthesis? I fthere is no carbon dioxide,will the plant respire and keep li ving? I'm pretty sure a plant can li ve for a long time sealed up in a jar , but I'm not sure how long or exactly what w ould make it die. STUDENT S: I believe that putting a smal l plant in a clos ed ma yonnaise jar at 60-80\u00b0F is murde r.I believe that this plant will not last past a week (3 da ys).This is so for many rea - sons. Contained in a jar with constant sunlight at 80\u00b0F the moisture in the soil will most lik ely start to e vaporate almost immediat ely.This wil l leave the soil dry while the air is humid. Since we are in a clos ed container no wat er can b e restor ed to the soil (condensation).This in tur n will cause no nut rients from the soil to reach the upper plant, no root pressure! Besides this, with pho tosynthesis occur ring in the leaves,at least for a short time while wat er sup - plies last, the C O2in the air is b eing us ed up and O2is replacing it. With no C O2and no H2O,no light reac tion and/or dark reac tion can occur and the plant can 't make carbo hydrates. The carbo hydrates are needed for ene rgy. In co n cl u s i o n , in a jar c l o sed from CO2and w a ter, plants use up their r e sou rces quic k ly, preve n ti n g the equation CO2+ H2O \u00ddC6H1 2O6and O2 a n d ,t h e refo re ,en ergy from car b ohyd ra te s . This jar also works as a catal yst to speed up the process by causing e vaporation o f H2O thr ough incomple te vaporization. This w ould shut do wn the r oot hair p ressure in the plant which allo ws water (if any) + nut rients to reach the lea ves.Allin all the plant will not li ve long (3 da ys at the most then do wnhill).

Stud ent E's resp onse is rat ed higher than Stud ent S's on the basis o fthe quality o f information.Stud ent S's justification p ro- vides some inf ormation about what the st u- dent does and d oes not know and p rovides some e vidence f or making inf the c omplementary r elationship o f photo- synthesis and respiration in crafting the jus - tification. Perhaps the stud ent does not know about respiration or that the p rocesses are c omplementar y. Alternatively, the tw o concepts may be st ored in memo ry in a wa y that did not facilitate b ringing both to bear on the e xercise. Testing the plausibility o f the inf r a c on- versation with the stud learn the stud ent kno ws ask. Ifthe stud ent kno ws about it and did not apply it in making the p rediction, this is e vidence that respiration is not understood in the c ontext ofthe lif proc esses o fplants. Stud ent resp onse is w ell structured and c onsist ent with the p rediction. The statements f orm a c onnected progression. The p rediction is t entative and the justifica - tion indicates it is t entative due to the la ck ofinformation in the p rompt and the st u-dent's unc ertainty about the quantitat ive details o fthe c ondition und er which phot o- synthesis and respiration o ccur. The stud ent is explicit about c ertain assump tions, for instance, the r elationship o fmine rals in the soil and plant g rowth.The questions the stud ent poses in the justification can b e interprete d as e vidence that alt ernative assump tions ha ve been considered. In contrast,Stud ent S's prediction is stat - ed with unwar ranted assurance and justifie d without c onsideration o fanything mo re than the a vailability o f sufficient wat er. Furthe rmore,the justification d oes not p ro- ceed in a se quential wa y, procee ding fr om general principles or empirical e vidence to a justification f or the p rediction. Stud ent S's resp onse highlights an imp or- tant p oint that justifies separating the sc or- ing o finformation fr om the sc oring o f rea- soning .A stud ent can c ompose a w - soned justification using inc orrec t informa- tion. For instance, had the stud ent posed the following justification, the reasoning would be adequate e ven ifthe c onclusion that the soil is dry w ere not c orrec t.The reasoning would be rat ed higher had the stud ent com- municat ed that Plants need ene rgy to li ve.Plants g et ene rgy from sunlight thr ough a p rocess o fphotosynthe - sis.Plants need wat er to pho tosynthesize.

ASSESSING THE ABILITY TO INQ U I R E The se cond assessment example f ocuses on inquir y. The content standards call f or understanding scientific inquiry and d evel- oping the ability to inquire. As in und er- standing the natural w orld,understanding and d oing inquiry are c onting ent on kno w- oncepts,principles,la ws,and the ories ofthe p hysical, life,and earth sciences. Inquiry also r equires reasoning capabilities and skills in manipulating lab oratory or field e quipment. As in und erstanding the natural w orld, inferences about stud ents'ability to inquir e and their und erstanding o fthe p rocess can be based on the anal ysis o f perfor mance in the science classr oom and w ork products. The example that follo ws describes twelfth g rade stud ents'participation in an extended inquir y. The exercise se rves tw o purposes. It provides the tea cher with inf or- mation about how w ell stud ents ha ve me t the inquiry standards. Equally imp ortant, it serves as a capst one exp erience f or the school science p rogram.The ext ended inquiry is int roduced ear ly in the schoolyear. It involves stud ents w orking as and g roups in vestigating a question o ftheir choice. IDENTIFYING A W O RTHWHILE AND R E S E A R CHABLE Q U E S T I O N . Throughout the school science p rogr am, stud ents ha ve been encourag ed to id entify questions that int erest them and ar e amenable to in vestigation. These questions are r ecorde d in stud ent resear ch not ebooks. Early in the senior year o fhigh school,st u- dents p repare draft stat ements o ques - tion they p ropose to in vestigate and discuss why that question is a reasonable one.

Scientists and stud ents learn to d efine smal l port ions or the c onve nience o finvestig a- tion. The units o finvestigation can b e referre d to as \"systems.\"A syst em is an org a- nized group o f related objects or c ompo- nents that f orm a whole. Systems can c on- sist, for example, of organisms, machines, fundamental par ticles, galaxies, ideas, num- bers,transp ortation, and e ducation. Systems have boundaries, components, resour ces flow (input and ou tput), and f eedback. The goal of this standard is to think and a n a ly z e in terms of s ys tem s .Thinking and a n a lyzing in terms of s ys tems w i ll help stu- dents keep track of m a s s , en er g y, ob j ect s , or ga n i s m s , and events referred to in the o t h e r con tent standar d s .The idea of s i m p l e s ys tems e n compasses s u b s ys t ems as well as i den ti f y ing the str u ctu re and funct i on of s ys- tem s ,feed b ack and eq u i l i b riu m , and the dis- ti n cti on be t ween open and c l o s ed sys tem s . Science assumes that the b ehavior o fthe universe is not cap ricious, that nature is the same e verywhe re,and that it is und erstand - able and p redictable.

Rather, ove r the course o f the year ,they would id entify and obse rve the elements o f weathe r; dev ise and use and r elationships with - in the data; and c ommunicate their w ork to the entire school. Mr.H.introduced the weather station t o the stud ents so on aft er school o pened. After a discussion o fstudents' experiences with and ideas about weathe r,Mr.H.asked the class what kinds o finformation the y thought would be imp ortant to colle ct and how they might go about colle cting it. The childr en quickly id entified the ne ed to recor d whether the day was sunny or cloud y, presence o f pre cipitation, and the t empera- ture. Mr.H.ask ed some questions, and the list b ecame mo re complicat ed:What kinds of clouds w ere H p recipi- tation a ccumulat ow did t emperature change during the day? What was the wind speed and dir ection? One stud ent said that he had heard on the weather r epor t that there was a high-p ressure fr ont mo ving in. What is a fr ont,he ask ed,and is it imp or- tant? At the end o fthe discussion, some one mentioned humidity and r ecalled the muggy heat wa ve ofthe summe r.

Mr.H. supporte d this, although the childr abili - ty to und erstand the c oncept was limit ed. The int erest o fthe stud ent and her par ent and the class 'familiarity with the t erm seemed reason enough. The stud ents r ecorde d their data o n charts in the classr oom for 2 months.

Again, the w ork began with a discussion. What w ere some o f the ideas that the stud ents had about the weather aft er all this measuring and r ecord- ing? W ere any patt erns obse rved? Many st u- dents thought the t emperature was g etting lower; several not ed that if it was windy one day,it rained the next da y. As ideas w ere present ed,other stud ents ag reed or chal - lenged what was said.Mr .H.listened and wrote the ideas on a chart as the stud ents spoke. When the discussion quie ted,he turned the stud ents'attention to the list and asked them to think about which o fthe ideas on the b oard they might a ctually be able to c onfirm by r eviewing the data. They listed several and ag reed on the follo wing list f or a star ting pla ce:Is the t emperature getting lo wer? What is the r elationship between the dir ection o fthe wind and the weather the next day? What hap pened whe n the p ressure w ent down or up? Was it cold er when it was cloudy? Mr.H.remind ed the stud ents o fsome ways they might r epresent the data to help them in the anal ysis;he then assigned tasks, and the stud ents r eturned to their g roups. Sever al da ys later,the w ork was w ell und er way.One g roup was w orking on a bar g raph showing the total numb er of sunny, cloud y, and rainy da ys;another had ma de a temper- ature g raph that sho wed the daily fluc tua- tions and sho wed the weather d efinitely was getting cold er;an int eresting table il lustrat- ed that when the p ressure dr oppe d the weather usual ly seemed to g et worse.The next challenge was to p repare an int eresting repor t for the school, highlighting all that had b een learned.The weather class c ontinued to o perate the weather station all year . The stud ents became quite ind ependent and efficient in collecting data. The data w ere analyz ed approximat ely every 2 months. Some ne w questions w ere considered,and the basic ones c ontinued. Midyear Mr .H.was satis - fied that the stud ents und erstood the use o f charts and g raphs, and he int roduced a sim - ple c ompu ter program that the stud ents could use to log their data.

Stud ents usual ly bring some v ocabular y and p rimitive notions o fatomicity to the science class b ut often lack und erstanding o f the e vidence and the lo gical arguments that support the par ticulate mo del ofmatt er. Their ear ly ideas are that the par ticles ha vethe same p ropert ies as the par ent mat erial; that is, they are a tiny pie ce ofthe substance. It can be t empting to int roduce at oms and molecules or imp rove stud ents'understand - ing o fthem so that par ticles can be used as an explanation f or the p ropert ies o f ele- ments and c ompounds.

I think the bottom liquids are hea vier; they sink to the bottom . It separated into diff erent la yers because eac h has diff erent densities and they sit on t op of each othe r. \"What do you mean by de n s i ty ? \" a s ked Mr. B. It's how pac ked the par ticles are. This one is thick so it 's on the bottom. This one is thinnest. Doesn't oil ha ve light er density than wat er? If we put a thic ker liquid in, it would g o to the bottom. There's more o fthis one that 's on the bottom. The atoms in some are hea vier than the ones in othe rs. M r. B. r e a l i zed how many different ways the st u dents e x p l a i n e d what they saw, for ex a m p l e ,t h i c kness and thinness, h e avi n e s s and lig h tn e s s ,m o re and less, d i f ferent de n s i- ties and ato m s .The discussion gave him a s ense for what the st u dents were thinking. It was clear to him that the inv e s ti ga ti o ns he h ad planned for the f o ll owing weeks to fo c u s m ore cl o s ely on de n s i ty would be wor t hwh i l e . Mr. B.divided the class into se ven groups of four the next da y.On ea ch ofthe g roup's tables .B warne d the stud ents not to drink the liquid. Each group was to choose one p erson to be the materials manag er and one to be the recorde r as they p roceede d to find out what they could about the same liquids used the day b efore (all o f which w ere available o n the supply table). Only the mat erials man - ager was to c ome to the supply table f or the liquids, and the r ecorder s kept track of what they did. Fort y min utes lat er,Mr. B.askedstud ents to clean up and gather to shar e their obse rvations. Ever y group id entified some o fthe liq - uids. The wat er was easy ,as was the v eg- etable oil. Some stud ents knew c orn syrup, othe rs recog nized the d etergent.Sever al groups c ombined two and thr ee liquids and found that some o fthem mix ed together, and othe rs stayed separate. Some disag ree- ments arose about which liquid float ed on which. Mr. B. s uggested that int erested stu- dents c ome ba ck during their lunch time t o try to resol ve these disag reements. One group r eplicat ed the large cylind er,shook it vigorously,and was waiting to see whethe r the liquids would separate. Mr. B.asked that group to dr aw what the cylind er contents look ed like no w,put it on the wind owsill, and che ck it the next da y. Mr. B. beg an the third day with a larg e density column again. This time he g ave a small o bject to ea ch of four stud ents\u2014a piece of woo d,aluminum, plastic, or iron. He ask ed the class to p redict what would happen when ea ch ofthe four o bjects was released into the column. The stud ents p re- dicted and wat ched as some o bjects sank t o the bott om,and othe rs stoppe d some where in the columns. \"What do you think is g oing on?\"ask ed Mr. B.\"How can you explain the way these objects behaved? I d on't want answ ers now,\" he w ent on,\"I want you to t ry out some more things yourse lves and then w e'll talk. \" He then di vided the class into four g roups and g ave each a large d ensity column with the liquid la yers.The stud ents w orke d in their g roups f or 30 min utes.The discussio n was animat ed as diff erent rubber bands, a penny,a nic kel,a pencil,Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

Mr. B.circulat ed from group to g roup taking note o fmany int er- esting c omments. With 10 min utes left in the class, he gathe red the g roups t ogether and ask ed for some o ftheir obse rvations. When we dr oppe d something light er in, it stoppe d near the t op. The rub ber band is light er than the pap er clip . The pap er clip is heavy so it dr ops do wn. The rub ber band has buo yancy,ifyou kno w what that means. The nic kel went all the w ay to the bottom because it 's hea vier, but the p encil w ouldn't go into the last la yer because it was t oo thick. The p encil is w ood and it 's light er; the nic kel is silver and it 's hea vier. The nic kel is dens er than the p encil. M r. B.l i s ten ed to these o b s erva ti ons and en co u ra g ed the st u dents to r e s pond to o n e a n o t h e r.O cc a s i on a l ly he asked for a c l a ri f i - c a ti on \u2014 \" What do you mean by that?\" \" How did you do that?\" His pr i m a r y purpose was to hear the st u den t s'i deas and e n co u ra g e t h em to explain them to one another. The next day he b egan the last o fthe introductory exp eriences. When the st u- dents came in,Mr . B.asked them to di vide into their four g roups and go to the tables with the d ensity columns. Beside ea ch col - umn w ere several pie ces of woo d ofdiffer- ent sizes. Stud ents w ere to think and talk about what the pie ces might do in the col - umn, try them out, have mo re discussion, and w rite d own some o ftheir ideas in their science not ebooks.When enough time had passed, Mr. B. called the g roups t ogether and ask ed for some volunt eers to read fr om their not e- books. Some stud ents w ere struggling with what they had se en: They stuck in the middle o fthe c olumn. The pieces are not the same w eight. The big - ger ones are hea vier.I don 't know w hy they al l stoppe d in the middle. Others seemed to und erstand. One stud ent read, If yo u ha ve a block o f woo d and cut it int o millions o fpieces, each piece w ould ha ve the density o fthe original block. Ifthat block o f wood weighed one g ram and y ou cut it into a million pieces the w eight w ould change. But no matt er how many times y ou cut some - thing, the density will not change. When this stat ement was read Mr . B. asked how many p eople ag reed with it. Most stud ents quickly asse rted \"yes. \" Bu t how sur e were they? Mr . B.pulled out a pie ce of wood larger than any o fthose that the stud ents had t ried.\"What would hap pen ifthis pie ce of woo d were droppe d into the column?\" Some stud ents said immediat ely that it would st op whe re the smaller pie ces had. Others were not quite so sure. This pie ce was quite a bit big ger.One stud ent ask ed for a show o fhands. Twelv e stud ents thought this big pie ce of woo d would sink farthe r and 16 thought it would sink to the same level as the othe rs.Mr. B.droppe d it in. It stoppe d sinking whe re the othe rs had.

So me stud ents had p redicted this result, saying that the big ger one was hea vier and therefor e would sink. Others were per- plexed.The two pie ces were ma de ofthe same wax so they shouldn 't be diff erent. Something was w rong. W er e the two liquids really the same? Mr . B. re moved the pie ces ofwax fr om the c ontaine rs and r eversed them. This time the little one sank and the big one float ed.\"Unfair ,\"came a cho rus of voices. \"The liquids ar en't the same. \"Mr. B.had used wat er and iso propy l alco- hol. But he notic ed several stud ents w ere willing to explain the sinking o fthe larg er piece ofcandle and not the smaller by the difference in the size o fthe pie ce. Mr. B. c losed the lesson by summing up . They had se en the d ensity column and worke d with the liquids themse lves;they had t ried floating o bjects in liquids; they had se en the pie ces ofwax in the liquids. What was the explanation f or all these phe - nomena? F or home work that night he ask ed them to do two things. They w ere to think about and w rite d own any ideas they ha d about what was hap pening in all these exp e- riences.

By plotting the lo c a ti o ns of v o l c a n o es and e a rt h qu a ke s ,s tu d ents can see a pattern of geo l ogical activ i ty.E a rth has an outer m o s t ri gid shell cal l ed the lithosp h ere .It is made up of the crust and part of the upper mantle. It is br o ken into ab o ut a dozen r i gid plat e s that move w i t h o u t defor m i n g , except at bo u n d a r ies w h ere they c o ll i de . Those plat e s ra n ge in thickness from a few to more than 100 kilo m eters .O c ean floors are the tops of thin oceanic plates that spr e ad ou t w a r d from m i docean rift zo n e s ; land s u rf aces are the tops of t h i cker,l e s s - d ense co n ti n e ntal plat e s . Because stud ents do not ha ve dir ect con- tact with most o fthese phenomena and the long-t erm nature o fthe p rocesses,some explanations o fmoving plates and the e vo- lution o flife must be rese rved for late in grad es 5-8. As stud ents mature, the c oncept of ev aporation can be reasonab ly well understood as the c onservation o fmatt er combined with a p rimitive idea o fparticlesand the idea that air is real. Condensation is less w ell und erstood and r equires ext ensive observation and inst ruction to c omple te an understanding o fthe wat er cycle. The und erstanding that stud ents gain from their obse rvations rades K-4 p ro- vides the mot ivation and the basis fr om which they can b egin to c onstruct a mo del that explains the visual and p hysical r ela- tionships among earth, allow stud c onclude that earth is a mo ving,sphe rical planet, having unique features that distinguish it fr om other plan - ets in the solar syst em.From activities with trajectories and o rbits and using the earth- sun-mo on syst em as an example, stud ents can d evelop the und erstanding that g ravity is a ubiquitous f orce that holds all parts o f the solar syst em together.Energy fr om the sun transferred by light and other r adiatio n is the p rimary energy sour ce for processes on earth 's surfa ce and in its h ydrosphe re, atmosphe re,and biosphe re. By grades 5-8, students ha ve a clear notion about g ravity,the shape o fthe earth, and the r elative positions o fthe earth, sun, and mo on.Never theless, more than half of the stud ents will not be able to use these models to explain the phases o fthe mo on, and c orrec t explanations f or the seasons wil l be even mo re difficult to a chieve.

CO N S E R VATION OF ENERGY AND THE INCREASE IN DISORDER nThe total energy o fthe uni verse is c on- stant. Energy can be t ransferred by colli - sions in chemical and nuclear rea ctions, by light wa ves and other r adiations, and in many other wa ys.However, it cannever be dest roye d.As these t ransfers occur,the matt er involved becomes steadily less o rdere d. nAll energy can be c onsidered to be eithe r kinetic energ y, which is the energy o f motion; potential energ y, which d epends on relative position; or energy c ontaine d by a field, such as ele ctromagne tic wa ves. nHeat c onsists o f random motion and the vibrations o fatoms,molecules, and ions. The higher the t emperature,the g reater the at omic or molecular motion. nEverything tends to become less o r ga- n i zed and less orderly over t i m e . Thu s ,i n a ll en er g y tra n s fers ,the over a ll ef fect is that the e n er g y is spr e ad out unifor m ly. Examples are the tr a n s fer of e n er g y from h o t ter to co o l er obj ects by co n du c ti on , rad i a ti on , or convect i on and the war m i n g of our s u rro u n d i n g s wh en we b u rn fue l s . I N T E R ACTIONS OF ENERGY AND MATTER nWaves,including sound and seismic waves,wa ves on wat er,and light wa ves, have energy and can t ransfer energ y when they int eract with matt er. nElectromagne tic wa ves result when a charg ed object is a ccelerated or d ecelerat- ed.Electromagne tic wa ves inc lude r adio waves (the longest wa velength), micr owaves,infrar ed radiation (r adiant heat), visible light, ultraviolet r adiation, x-rays,and gamma r ays.The energy o f electromagne tic wa ves is car ried in pa ck- ets whose magnitude is in versely propor- tional to the wa velength. nEach kind o fatom or molecule can gain or lose energy only in par ticular discr ete amounts and thus can abso rb and emitSee Con tent Standard C (grades 9-12)See Con tent Standard D (grades 9-12)Copyright \u00a9 National Academy of Sciences.

In sense organs, specializ ed cells detect light, sound, and specific chemicals and enable animals t o monit or what is g oing on in the w orld around them. nOrganisms ha ve behavioral resp onses t o internal changes and to ext ernal stimuli. Responses to ext ernal stimuli can result from int eract ions with the organism 's own species and othe rs,as w ell as e nvi- ronmental changes; these resp onses either can be innate or learned.

They will disc over that while c ertain p roper- ties o fthe earth syst em may fluc tuate o n short or long time scales, the earth syst em will generally stay within a c ertain nar row range f or millions o f years. This long-t erm stability can be und erstood through the working o fplanetary g eochemical cy cles and the f eedback processes that help t o maintain or modify those cy cles. As an example o fthis long-t erm stabilit y, stud ents find that the g eologic record sug - gests that the global t emperature has fluc tu- ated within a r elatively nar row range, one that has b een nar row enough to enable lif e to sur vive and e volve for over thr ee billio n years.

They explo re the r egulation o fearth 's global temperature by the wat er and car bon cycles. Using this ba ckground, stud ents can exam - ine e nvironmental changes o ccurring t oday and make fu empera- ture fluc tuations in the earth syst em. Looking outward into d eep spa ce and deep time, astronome rs have sho wn that w elive in a vast and ancient uni verse.Scientists assume that the la ws ofmatt er are the same in all parts o fthe uni verse and o ver billions of years.

In pre p a- ra ti on for building models of the solar sys- tem ,she wanted the st u dents to est i m a t e the c i rc u m f eren ce of the ear t h .The activ i ty was de s i gn e d to al l ow stu dents to think and act l i ke astro n om e rs 500 y e a rs ago.

Ms.B.set the stage by r eviewing what the stud ents alrea dy knew about the solar sy s- tem,especially about the earth, sun,and moon.Then they talk ed briefly about build -ing mo dels and d etermined that to make a scale mo del they would ha ve to know ho w big ea ch object in the solar syst em was and also the distances b etween them.Ms. B. asked whether they knew these fa cts abou t the sun, moon and earth. Someone said they could look it up . But Ms. B.said that although they could g et the answ er this wa y, instead they w ere going to t ry to find out f or themse lves,similar to the way ast ronome rs learned new things. She asked the st u dents how they thoug h t the cir c u m f eren ce of the earth was meas u red . Som eone said by meas u ring on a map. Som eone else said by flying around it keep- ing track of the distanc e .M s . B. told the m , h owever, that C o lu m b us had an appro x i- m a te , but limite d ,i d ea of h ow big the ear t h was before anyone had gone around it. S h e said they were going to determine the cir- c u m f eren ce of the earth using the North Star. M s .B. gave each st u dent a diagram of t h e North Star and the stars of the Big and Little Di pper,d rawn to scale. The stars were or i en t- ed the way they would be looking due nor t h at ab o ut 8:00 p . m .in their tow n .She directed the st u dents to o b s erve and make sketches of the p o s i ti o ns of the Big D i pper, the Little Di pper, and the North Star at dark and at least two hours later. Sever al da ys later stud ents c ompar ed notes on the stars. Almost e veryo ne ha d found them, many f or the first time.

B.s a i d , t h ey were r e ady to try to find the cir c u m f eren ce of the ear t h .She c h a ll en g ed each group of four to use their g l obes to answer the q u e s- ti on : \"Si n ce the North Star didn't appear to m ove ,what direct i on would it be if you were standing at the North P o l e ? \" Af ter some t i m e for thinking, discussing and moving the gl obe ar o u n d , the class shared their answer s . Several groups said it would be r i ght over- h e ad . As ked to explain why, t h ey used the i r gl obes to ill u s tra te that if it were not, i t wo u l d n 't stay due north as the earth t u rn ed . M s .B.t h en drew a sketch of the ear t h , with the familiar W e s tern He m i s ph e re fa c i n g h er, on the b l ack boa rd . She drew an arrow s tra i ght up from the North P o l e ,poi n ting to the North Star, and she also made a dot on the eq u a tor at the e d ge of h er sketch on the G i l bert and Ellis Islands in the Pa c i f i c .S h e a s ked :\"Wh i ch way is the North Star for s om e one in the Gilbert and Ellis I s l a n d s ? \" Figure 1. Ms.B. 's Sketch ofthe earthEach group was dir ected to rea ch a c on- sensus o f where to dr aw the ar row from the Gilb ert and Ellis Islands on the sk etch,but some could not. Each group,and the hold - outs, put an ar row on the b oard to il lustrate their answ er.One ar row pointed straight up , and the rest p ointed at a range o fangles, most t oward a p oint near the t op ofthe blackboard. How could they find out who was a ccurate? Ms. B. suggested that they use what they knew to t ry to d ecide who among the g roups might be right. To help the st u- dents g et star ted on this task,she ask ed each group how high up they thought the N orth Star was. Accor ding to whe re their ar rows pointed,most had assumed that the N orth Star was only a f ew earth diame ters above the N orth Pole. Ms.B.then ask ed what the students thought the distance to the N orth Star real ly was c ompar ed with the size o fthe earth. Now many stud ents said that it must be very far away b ecause it 's a star and star s are v ery far awa y. In the end c onsensus was reached that if the N orth Star w ere very far away\u2014a g reat many earth diame ters\u2014the straight up ar row in the sk etch would p oint to this star ,no matt er whe re one was on the drawing o fthe earth.

B. ch a ll en g ed the groups to use their compasses and pr o trac- tors to make a drawing that would give them the answer s .Wh en the groups had come up with some id e a s ,she led them in a discus- s i on on how the angle c h a n g ed as the dis- t a n ce around the earth from the p o l e ch a n g ed .Th ey agreed that it got smal l er and s m a ll e r, going from 90 degrees at the pole to 45 degrees 1/8 of the way ar o u n d , and 0 degrees at the eq u a tor. The next da y,Ms.B.put a g raph with the three points the stud ents had found so far on the b oard. She ask ed how they could p re- dict the angle o fthe N orth Star f or two points, A and B , which she add ed to the graph, one halfway b etween the 45 d egree point and the pole and the other halfwa y between the 45 d egree point and the e qua- tor? The stud ents sug gested a st raight on the g raph which fitt ed their thr ee points would r epresent the r elationship b etween the angle and distance around the earth. The stud ents also ag reed that this was just a guess. Ms.B.asked how they could be mo re certain and they d ecided they could go ba ck to their dr awing,use their p rotractor s to pu t A and B on it, and measure what the angle ofthe N orth Star would be.Figure 2. Ms.B. 's Graph The result o ftheir g raphic in vestigatio n confirmed that a st raight line se emed to b e a good graph f or the r elationship b etween the angle f ormed by the N orth Star and the horizon and distance around the earth. Ms.B.then told them that in Columbus ' day it was kno wn from ground t ravel that the distance b etween a t own in Scandina via where the N orth Star angle was 67 d egrees and another in Italy whe re the N orth Star angle was 43 d egrees was about 3,000 miles. People who knew what the stud ents no w knew could figure out the circumf erence o f the earth. The groups w ere to take their data to math class whe re they would ha ve time t o figure out the earth 's circumf erence and then p rocee d to look in the lib rary f or the best mo dern value.

In suc ceeding da ys they calculat - ed the distance to the mo on and its circum - ference and look ed up the same inf ormatio n for the sun.

S YSTEM STANDARD B: Policies that influence science e d u c ation should be co o rd i n a te d within and across agencies, i n s t i - t u t i o n s , and or g a n i z at i o n s .

One example of the need for coor d i n a ti o n is the v a rious stat e - l evel req u i rem ents for k n owing and understanding scie n ce con ten t . Because different agencies are inv o lved ,t h e con tent of s c i en c e co u rses in inst i tuti ons of h i gh e r edu c a ti o n for pr o s pective t e ach ers could be different from the s u bj ect - m a t t er com peten ce req u i red for t e ach er lice n su re , and both could be different from the scie n ce con tent req u i rem ents of the state curr i c u lu m f ra m e work .Ot h er examples incl u de coor d i- n a ti o n be t ween those who set req u i rem en t s for grad u a ti o n from high sc h ool and those who set a d m i s s i o ns req u i rem ents for c o ll ege s and univer s i ti e s .

Resour ces are in sho rt suppl y,and d eci- sions about their allocation are difficult t o make. Some resour ce-allocation questions that are r egular ly faced by local and stat e school b oards inc lude the p roport ion o f hours in the school day to be allocat ed to science; the p roport ion o fthe school budg et to be allocat ed to science e ducation f or underachieving,special-ne eds,or talent ed science stud ents;and the assignments o fthe most exp erienced and talent ed tea chers.The mandates c ontained in policies are far t oo often mo re ambitious in vision than realistic in providing the r equired resour ces.

The challenge to the larg er sys- tem is to sup port these policies with ne ces- sary resour ces. S YSTEM STANDARD F: All p o l i c y instr u m e n ts must be rev i ewed for possible unint e n d e d e f fe c ts on the classroom pr a ct i c e of science educa t i o n . Even w h en as many implicat i ons as p o s s i- ble have been care f u lly co n s i dered ,well - i n ten- ti on ed policies can have uninte n ded ef fect s .

Unless care is tak en,policies int ended to improve science e ducation might a ctually have detrimental eff ects on learning . For instance, policies int ended to monit or the quality o fscience tea ching can r equire extensive stud ent time to take tests. And teacher time to c orrec t them and file r epor ts on scores can take valuable time away fr om learning and tea ching science. To reduce unint ended eff ects,those who a ctually implement science e ducation policies, such as tea chers and other e ducators,should b econstantly in volved in the r eview o fthose policies. Only in this way can the policies b e continuously imp rove d. S YSTEM STANDARD G: Re s p onsible individuals must take the opp o rt u n i t y aff o rded by the s t a n d a r ds-based r e fo r m move- m e n t to achieve the new vision of s c i e n c e education p o rt r ayed in the St a n d a rd s . This standard a cknowledges the role that individuals play in making changes in social systems,such as the science e ducation sy s- tem.Ultimat ely,individuals w orking within standards-based science e ducatio n resides with indi viduals in the science e du- cation and science c ommunities. Teachers play an a ctive role in the f ormu- lation o fscience e ducation policy ,especially those policies f or which they will be held accountable. They should be p rovided with the time to e xercise this resp onsibilit y,as well as the o pport unity to d evelop the knowledge and skill to discharge it.
