Gualano BS [2], Prabha Siddarth PhD [3], and Eric Segal MD [1,4] 1 Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey 07601 2 Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, Nutley, New Jersey 07110 3 Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90024 4 Northeast Regional Epilepsy Group, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey 0 7601 Background: Marijuana -based therapies (MBTs) have been shown to reduce seizure frequency in patients with severe and drug -resistant epilepsy (DRE). Pharmaceutical -grade CBD (Epidiolex ) was approved by the FDA in 2018 for the treatments of Dravet Syndrome (DS) and Lennox - Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) and subsequently in 2020 for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). It is unclear what the utility would be in prescribing one type of MBT if a previ ous, alternative type failed. We conducted a retrospective study with the objective to determine if an alternative formulation of MBT reduces seizure frequency if the patient has not had a meaningful response from an initial MBT. We also investigated the c linical impact that a second MBT has on side effect profile. Methods: We reviewed the charts of patients with DRE who were at least 2 years old and who took at least 2 different formulations of MBT, including a pharmacologic formulation of CBD (Epidiolex ), artisanal marijuana, and/or a hemp -based formulation. We reviewed medical records in patients 2 years of age and older; however, subjects' historical data, such as age of first seizure onset, may be prior to the age of 2 years. We extracted data on de mographics, type of epilepsy, history of epilepsy, medication history, seizure count, and drug side effects. Seizure frequency, side effect profiles, and predictors of responder status were evaluated . Results: Thirty patients were identified as taking mor e than 1 type of MBT. Our findings suggest that seizure frequencies do not change significantly from baseline to after the first MBT and to after the second MBT (p = 0.4). However, we did find that patients with greater baseline seizure frequency were sig nificantly more likely to respond to treatment after the second MBT (p = .03). To our second endpoint of side effect profile, we found that patients who experienced side effects after a second MBT had significantly greater seizure frequency compared to tho se who did not (p = .04). Conclusion: We found no significant seizure frequency reduction from baseline to after a second MBT in patients who tried at least 2 different formulations of MBT. This suggests a low probability of seizure frequency reduction wi th a second MBT therapy in patients with epilepsy who tried at least two different MBTs. While these findings need to be replicated in a larger sample, they suggest that clinicians should not delay care by trying alternative MBT formulations after a patien t has already tried one. Instead, it may be more prudent to attempt an alternative class of therapy.

Hovnanian Children's Hospital. Pediatrics Department. [2] Hackensack -Meridian School of Medicine Background: Ambulatory care -sensitive conditions (ACSCs) are conditions for which high - quality outpatient care can potentially prevent the need for hospitalization. Studies have consistently demonstrated a link between increased hospitalization rates due to ACSC and minority or low socioeconomic status. Neighborhood -level opportunities, described by the Child Opportunity Index (COI), have been previously used to explore the association of ACSC and other social determinants of health in the pediatric population, but ha ve not explored the associations in pediatric and adult populations. Our objective is to determine the association between hospitalization rates for ACSC and neighborhood -based conditions utilizing the COI by age groups (0 -17,18 -24, 25 -64, and 65 and above ). Design/Methods: Retrospective database analysis of the New Jersey (NJ) population during 2019. The exposure was the ZIP code -level COI, and the outcome was the hospitalization rate per 10,000 residents for ACSC. The COI uses 29 weighted indicators acro ss three domains to describe the level of opportunity within a tract, from very low to very high. Demographics for the study population were established using census data from the American Community Survey. Hospitalizations for ACSC were extracted from the New Jersey state Inpatient Database (SID). We used Poisson regression models to compare hospitalization rates for ACSC across levels of COI. Results: 7,349,317 people were included, the majority of which were white (53%). 29% of people living in very low COI areas were Black, and 39% were Hispanic, compared to 15% who were White. The rate of hospitalization by each ACSC diagnosis varied by age. The three most common ACSC for children (0 -17) were asthma, seizure, and bacterial pneumonia; for young adults ( 18-24) were seizure, diabetes, and depression. In adults (25 -64) were diabetes, cellulitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); for the elderly group (65 years old and above) were cardiac heart failure, COPD, and bacterial pneumonia. We obser ved higher hospitalization rates for ACSC in the 0 -17 (0.71 95% Confidence -0.74), 18 -0.61) and 25 -64 (1.11 95%CI 1.09 -1.13) age groups living in neighborhoods of very low COI (p< .001). ACSC hospitalization rates decr eased as COI tract increased across all age groups (p< .001). Conclusion: Hospitalization rates for ACSC in NJ were associated with COI, suggesting that inequities are closely tied to health outcomes regardless of age. Findings support the use of COI to provide targeted interventions to reduce the rate of ACSC hospitalizations.

CSA is a treatable condition and its testing and treatment would help to improve cardiovascular outcomes and quality of life for th e patients. Methods: The general design is a prospective observational study. The protocol is survey -based. The questionnaire we designed is named, SCOUTS -BAG -HARMS. It was formulated by a panel of subject matter experts at JFKUMC by reviewing the literat ure for symptoms, demographics and co -morbidities associated with CSA. Thereafter psychometric validation of the questionnaire was done in the sleep lab by administering a post -questionnaire survey to patients undergoing a diagnostic polysomnogram to ensur e that patients are able to understand the questions clearly and easily. Over the next 12 months, we anticipate screening for CSA in 200 consecutive patients ( 21 years of age), who are referred for overnight diagnostic PSG to the JFK Sleep Lab. The quest ionnaire will be available in English and Spanish. Currently there is no screening tool for CSA. Therefore, we seek to validate our bedside questionnaire as a screening tool to assess the risk of having CSA. We hypothesize that a score of >6 out of 20 on t his questionnaire will correlate with a central apnea index (CAI) >5/hr on that patient's diagnostic PSG. Subset analysis will include risk stratification. For example, a score of 11 is more likely to be associated with CSA on a diagnostic PSG than a score of 6 Results: There are 30 patients that have completed this questionnaire since the study went live on 01/17/2023 at JFK University Medical Center Sleep lab. Data analysis to correlate their screening questionnaire score to their Central apnea index (CA I) score on the sleep test is underway. Conclusion: We are planning to study 200 records to adequately power this study to achieve statistical significance as advised by HMH biostatistician Dr. Mani Paliwal. We will submit the data available so far.

The purpose of this study is to establish whether there is a benefit in incorporating palliative care for older a dults with primary malignant lung or colorectal cancer in outpatient settings to facilitate appropriate hospice referral for end of life care. Methods: Data was collected from patients with primary malignancy lung or colorectal cancers in ambulatory clini cs at John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack Meridian Health between 2017 and 2022. Palliative care was added to the standard of care in the outpatient oncology setting in 2019. We compared data from patients pre (Control group {CG} 2017 -2019) and post (Intervention group {IG} 2020 -2022) integration of palliative care. Data was collected for demographics (age, race, ethnicity, gender and religion) and primary outcomes were hospice referrals and length of stay on hospice. Results: This retrospective study i ncluded 7,024 patients in the IG and 3,244 patients in the CG. Out of all participants, the majority were white (74.8% CG, 78.8% IG), not Spanish/Hispanic/Latino Christian faith (77.4% CG, 79.2% IG). IG had a statistically signifi cant higher hospice referral rate (1,325/7,024 = 18.9%) than those in the (62/3,244 = 1.9%), chi -square test p -value <0.0001. Those in the IG had a statistically significantly shorter length of stay (median=6 days) compared to those in the CG (median = 8 days), Wilcoxon rank sum test p -value =0.0413. Patients with lung cancer had higher referral rates in the IG than patients with colon cancer (941/1,325 = 71% compared to 363/3,244 = 27.4%). Conclusion: Our study indicates that introducing palliative car e in the ambulatory oncology setting for older adults improved hospice referral. Furthermore, this study helped showcase implementing standardized hospice referral protocol for advanced cancer stages noted to increase referral rates when comparing lung and colorectal cancers. No improvement was noted in length of stay when comparing intervention and control groups. Having easy access to palliative and hospice care in ambulatory oncology settings and adopting standardized protocols for hospice referrals may improve provision of timely end of life care .

Methods: Patients from JFK sleep clinic RLS symptoms and vitamin D deficiency (25OH Vit D level <30) were included in the study in the time period of December 2019 to current. Patients with Severe RLS (iRLS score 31) who may need immediate intervention or who are currently on treatment for RLS or on vitamin D supplementation are excluded. The study design is controlling for confounding factors (OSA and Iron deficiency anemia). Subjects will be randomly divided into two groups of \"treatment\" vs \"control\". Each group will receive either vitamin D 50000 IU weekly or placebo for 6 weeks and will be crossed over into the other group at week 7. Both the patient and the investigator will be blinded to th e nature of substance A and substance B. The computerized randomization of substance A or B to be the active agent or the control substance will be done by JFK hospital pharmacy who will dispense the substances to the patient. Subjects are required to comp lete the iRLS questionnaire along with vitamin D levels at baseline (week zero), middle of the study (week 7) and at the end of the study (week 14). In addition to the subjective iRLS questionnaire, study instruments include Actigraphy for objective data o f leg movements that patients will wear on their ankle at week 0, week 7 and week 14 to monitor their leg activity index. Results: To this date, there have been 4 subjects recruited from JFK sleep clinic. One subject did not complete the study, one droppe d out after starting taking vitamin D supplement outside of study protocol, one who successfully completed the study and one who is currently participating. Data will be included in the presentation. Conclusion: We are planning on studying a sample size o f 50 patients for improvement in their RLS symptoms after completing treatment with vitamin D 50000 IU weekly for 6 weeks by subjective questionnaire and objective monitoring of their leg activity index at night. We hope to assess whether vitamin D supplem entation in deficient patients could be a treatable form of RLS.

While some toxin spread is expected, local spread beyond the muscle fascicle or distant toxin effect may impair patients ' function. There has not been investigation as to clinical factors that may impact risk of toxin spread beyond the intended muscle. In this study, we examine the associations between clinical factors and observed muscle leak during injections in flexor ca rpi radialis (FCR) muscle in the upper extremity. Methods: This study was performed at the HMH Johnson Rehabilitation Institute outpatient spasticity clinic. Patients scheduled for botulinum toxin injections for management of upper extremity spasticity we re invited to participate in the study if physical examination demonstrated involvement of the FCR warranting injection. If patients were eligible and agreed to participate, informed consent was obtained. During the patient's visit, a 5 -15MHz linear array ultrasound transducer was used to visualize botulinum toxin injection into the flexor carpi radialis. Still and video images were saved for later review. Baseline demographic and clinical information was obtained from the chart including age, sex, diagnosi s, BMI, time since neurologic diagnosis, number of prior injections and Modified Ashworth Score at the wrist. Images were reviewed by two of the study authors with experience in ultrasound -guided spasticity management. Baseline characteristics including pr e-injection AP diameter, Modified Heckmatt Score, and whether toxin leak could be visualized beyond the intended muscle belly were documented. Results: Twenty patients were enrolled between January and March 2023. Mean age was 53.65 and 75% of the patient s were male. Diagnoses included ischemic stroke (55%), hemorrhagic stroke (30%), spastic quadriplegia (10%). Median number of units injected were 30, ranging between 20 and 50 units. 65% of patients had received >10 prior botulinum toxin injections. Median Modified Heckmatt Score was 3 and mean AP diameter of the FCR muscle was 8.324. Leak of botulinum toxin injection was visualized in three of twenty patients and could not be determined for two patients. For 2/3 with vi sualized leak, needle entry point was noted to be lateral of midline. Statistical associations between toxin leak and clinical factors are still being determined and will be available prior to HMH Resident/Fellow Research Day. Conclusion: Leak beyond the intended muscle fascicle may occur when following prescribing information of onabotulinumtoxinA for spasticity. Care should be taken to minimize risk of leak and unintended weakness in the surrounding muscles.

MD [1], Aseel MD [2] [1] Department of General Pediatrics; [2] Institute for Child Development at Hackensack University Medical Center Background: The goal of this initiative was to improve surveillance and documentation of developmental milestones by pediatric residents during well child visits. Methods: Using the smart phrase function of Epic, the electronic medical record used at the Pediatric Academic Practice at Hackensack University Medical Center, age -specific checklists of developmental milestones were created using the CDC's updated milestones for each w ell visit with additional questions for autism surveillance specifically at 18, 24, and 30 months. A pre - implementation survey was completed by all pediatric residents to gauge their comfort level reviewing developmental milestones without standardized che cklists. Residents were reminded and encouraged to use the smart phrases at each well visit. After three months of using the checklists, post -implementation surveys were distributed to assess if the checklists impacted resident education. As a secondary me asure, well child visits for patients ages 0 -5 years were reviewed from January to March and May to July of 2022 to determine if there were differences in how residents documented surveillance before and after the checklists were implemented. Results: Improvements were seen in overall resident comfort level, efficiency, and documentation when comparing pre and post survey results and chart review. Using the smart phrases during each well visit resulted in more uniform identification of developmental delays . Residents endorsed feeling more comfortable with assessing for developmental milestones and escalating care when needed using the aforementioned checklists as a guide. Conclusion: Use of uniformed methods in reviewing developmental milestones during a w ell visit improves comfort level, documentation, and efficiency of pediatric residents. In addition, it is more likely to raise concerns or pick up on any developmental delays, which is key for a pediatric academic practice.

A, [5] Chhabra. R, MD [6] Khalil. M, MD [7] Hackensack University Medical Center Background: Recent studies have shown an increased risk of mortality, brain injury, seizures and NDI in infants with mild HIE. In early hours after a significant hypoxic ischemic event, the majority of newborns do not demonstrate clear signs of brain compromi se yet these abnormalities may develop in the ensuing hours to days after birth. Objective: Identify the gap in our current clinical practice by investigating short term outcomes among newborns >35 weeks born with significant metabolic acidosis but did not meet therapeutic hypothermia (TH) criteria. Methods: Single center retrospective chart review of newborns from Jan.2018 to Mar.2021 with cord gas pH <7.0 and/or base excess 12 mmol/L born at HUMC. Those with birth anomalies, birth weight <1800g, or met TH criteria were excluded. Summary statistics include mean with standard deviation and counts with associated frequencies. Group comparisons were performed using Student t -test, with a significance threshold at 0.05. Results: Initial sample size was 184. 18 received TH. Final n= 166. 28% had initial pH < 7 and BE 12. 24% had initial pH < 7 (Mean7.07, SD 0.10). 89% had a BE 12 (Mean 14.2, SD 2.1).48% (79) delivered vaginally, 52%(87) via C Section. Those born via C Section had a significantly lower pH than those delivered vaginally(7.04 vs 7.1,p=0.0008).Total of 42 infants had a sentinel event (Cat III tracing, shoulder dystocia, placental abruption, uterine rupture or cord prolapse). Having a sentinel event was not associated with a lower pH 7.05 vs. 7 .08 (p= 0.1315). There was no association between having low Apgar scores and having a low pH. 60% (99) were admitted to the NICU and 40% (67) to the WBN. 80/99 (81%) of admissions to the NICU were due to respiratory distress, of which 2/80 developed seizu res at 9 and 14 hours of life. 6% (6/99) for possible sepsis, 13% (13/99) for closer monitoring. 16% (11/67) of patients in WBN were transferred to NICU. 8/11 (72%) had hypoglycemia, one associated with AKI on admission.1/11 (9%) had respiratory distress, 1/11 (9%) had temperature instability, and 1/11 (9%) had bloody stools. Conclusion: Infants retrospectively identified with severe acidosis at birth who didn't meet TH criteria on admission, were at higher risk for admission or transfer to NICU. Findings during admission included hypoglycemia, respiratory distress, temperature instability, AKI, and seizures. These outcomes may represent the effects of possible perinatal hypoxia -ischemia. Therefore, this population may benefit from close monitoring in NICU settings to further detect possibly missed mild HIE cases. Larger scale studies are required to confirm these findings.

[2] Hackensack School of Medicine [3 ] Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Hackensack University Medical Center. Background: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) including urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturia are highly prevalent and recent studies have shown an increased prevalence of LUTS in patients with endometriosis. While these symptoms are traditionally treated either medically or with behavioral modifications, surgical excision is the gold standard for the management of suspected endometriosis. It remains unclear if surgical intervention for endometriosis provides LUTS relief. Our objective was to determine if surgical excision of suspected endometriosis is correlated with perceived improvement of voiding dysfunction. Methods: This retrospective cohort study assessed 71 women (18 -59 years old) who underwent a robotic -assisted laparoscopic e xcision of suspected endometriosis with a single provider at an academic institution between 2020 -2021. A post -operative survey evaluated the perceived change in the severity of voiding dysfunction, specifically urinary urgency, frequency, and nocturia, a mean of 9.42\u00b16.99 months after surgery. This study was approved by the institutional review board and all patients provided informed consent. Results: Of the 71 women assessed, pathology -confirmed endometriosis was noted in 49 patients (69.01%). Of those with concomitant hysterectomies, half (n=13) had confirmed adenomyosis (total n=58 for endometriosis and/or adenomyosis positive). 73.6% (n=53) of all patients were noted to have gross peritoneal inflammation. Rates of perceived LUTS were significantly dec reased when comparing pre and post urinary difficulty emptying bladder (37.1% and frequent UTI (22.9% vs 5.8%, p=0.009). When stratified by pathology consistent with or negative for endometriosis and/or adenomyosis, both groups showed a significant improvement in nocturia. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the rate of LUTS i mprovement between patients who did (n=26) versus did not (n=45) have a hysterectomy at time of surgery. There was no significant difference in the percent changes of LUTS before and after surgical intervention for patient follow -up greater than (range=7 -22 months) versus less than 6 months. Conclusion: Excision of suspected endometriosis overlying pelvic sidewall by minimally invasive surgical intervention was reported to provide significant relief of LUTS in patients with inflammatory disease. Rates of symptom improvement were preserved with increased time intervals following surgery, regardless of pathology findings. These findings highlight the increasing clinical importance of surgical management in improving LUTS for women with endometriosis.

Sanzari Children's at Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ [2] Department of Biology, Tufts University, Medford, MA [3] Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack Meridian H ealth, Nutley, New Jersey, USA Introduction: Children presenting with symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) commonly require multidisciplinary care, and we suspected that medical care barriers due to the COVID -19 pandemic led to diagnosis delays an d increased complications of IBD. Our objective was to assess impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic on the time to diagnosis and severity of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing children diagnosed w ith IBD at our center two years before the start of the COVID -19 pandemic to those diagnosed two years after the pandemic. Data collected included demographics, diagnosis subtype, time to diagnosis, and complications of disease. Summary statistics include mean with standard deviation and counts with associated frequencies. Group comparisons were performed using Student t -test or Wilcoxon, as appropriate, with 0.05 for significance. Results: We assessed 110 pediatric patients aged 3 -20 years with newly diag nosed IBD, including 42 pre -pandemic and 68 during the pandemic. There was no significant difference in demographics or subtype of IBD between the two groups. There was no significant difference in the number of patients who presented to the ED in the pre -pandemic vs. pandemic groups (p - value = 0.17); however, 100% of children who presented during the pandemic were admitted to the PHM service compared to 50% of patients who presented pre -pandemic. Additionally, those admitted during the pandemic had signifi cantly faster time to endoscopy (8 vs. 15 days, p -value = <0.01), presented with more abscesses (0% vs. 18.2%), and required more surgery (0% vs. 9.1%), but received a similar number of packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusions (30% vs. 36%). Discussion/Conclusion: Children diagnosed with IBD at our center during the COVID -19 pandemic were more likely to require admission to the PHM service and have significantly faster time to endoscopy, which was a surprising result given the lack of resource s at the beginning of the pandemic. This raises the possibility that children presenting with IBD during the pandemic had more severe disease to prompt admission and more rapid endoscopy. This is also supported by the trend of increased complications at di agnosis, including abscess formation and increased surgical intervention. However, this study was limited by a small sample size and retrospective design, and larger studies are needed to assess the full impacts of the pandemic. Abstract # 11 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 11 TRENDS IN MESENCHYMAL STEM CELL CLINICAL TRIALS 2004 -2022 Maciej [2] [1] Internal Medicine Residency, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ [2] W. M. Keck Center for Collaborative Neuroscience, Rutgers University, Piscataway, New Jersey Background: A leading cause of disease and death for all age groups are syndromes characterized by widespread uncontrollable inflammation. Severe trauma induces pro - inflammatory responses, increasing the risk of complications. Mesen chymal Stem Cells (MSCs) have the remarkable ability of altering the immune response by emitting soluble anti - inflammatory factors, which rebalance the immune system and thereby may prevent additional damage and promote recovery. Efficacy of MSCs in the cl inic has been demonstrated in multiple conditions including Graft vs Host Disease and anal fistulas in Crohn's disease. We conducted this study to generate a current database of clinical trials and results reported, and to analyze the routes of administrat ion and the doses used for MSCs. Methods: To analyze trends and characteristics of MSC clinical trials, we created a novel database using data derived from Clinical.Trial.gov, including data on disease targets, sources of cells, doses being delivered and routes of administration. We analyzed 1440 MSC trials reported from 2004 -2022. We downloaded directly from ClinicalTrials.gov information that included the NCT number (identifier for each trial), title of the trial, recruitment status, sponsor, clinical phase, country of origin, and registration date. Additional data that could not be downloaded, including the sources of MSC, disease, route of administration and dose, were extracted from individual trial records. Results: Here we show the number of clinica l trials using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has increased since 2008, but then increased precipitously in 2020 due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Bone marrow aspirates from the pelvis has been and continues to be the most frequently used source of MSC for clin ical trials. Our analysis shows Intravenous (IV) injection is the most common, least invasive and most reproducible method, accounting for 47% of all trials. The median dose for IV delivery is 100 million MSCs/patient/dose. MSC doses were reported in only 57% of trials. Many trials indicate doses of <70 million MSCs/patient, which may be below the threshold for efficacy. Conclusion: Major factors that make comparisons among different trials difficult and may slow translation of MSCs to the clinic include h eterogeneity among MSCs from different sources and use of different cell preparation protocols. Improved trial designs are needed because heterogeneity in many trial parameters makes systematic analysis difficult. Increased reporting of clinical trial resu lts, especially negative results, which are rarely published, will help avoid potentially non -effective doses and reduce unnecessary duplication of clinical trials.

Olumuyiwa Fatade M.D., MPH [1], Nicholas Flugrad M.D. [2], MaryAnne Stern M.D. [2],[3] [1] Dep artment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Ocean University Medical Center, Ocean, NJ; [2] Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune, NJ; [3]Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, Hackensack, NJ Background: Compared to their younger counterparts, older adults have been found to use mental health services at lower rates (Karlin & Norris, 2006). This disparity is more pronounced among racial and ethnic minorities in the United States and continues t o persist despite efforts to decrease barriers to care. Addressing them requires an understanding of the unique characteristics of older patients along with factors associated with mental health services utilization. Project Objectives: Compare prevalence rates of specific disorders among Medicare recipients Compare CMS rates to prevalence rates from epidemiological studies Identify divergent trends Explore and clarify the origin of such trends Methods: We reviewed the U.S. Census Bureau data (USCB) and e xtracted demographic data from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) using the mapping Medicare disparities population tool (MMD) Data extraction criteria: Location: United States National, New Jersey, Ocean County, and Monmouth County Data w as limited to the year 2018 Basic demographic data collected included: Age 65+, All races, White, Black, Hispanic, Asian /PI CMS data were further stratified by diagnosis including Alzheimer's disease, Schizophrenia, Depression Analysis: All parameters wer e reported as prevalence rates Results: The national prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease was respectively 10%, 10%, 8%, and 7% among white, black, hispanic and AP/I Medicare recipients; highest prevalence among the black population in Monmouth County (12%) despite the county having lower proportions of aged (USCB) population compared to their white counterparts The national prevalence for depression was 15%, 10%, 8%, and 6% among white, black, hispanic and AP/I among Medicare recipients The schizophrenia pre valence rates of 1% are strikingly uniform across national, state, county, race / ethnic groups in the Medicare population without any divergent trends Conclusion: Our findings, consistent with other studies, and with the national data, suggest that black New Jersey Medicare recipients, and Ocean and Monmouth County Medicare recipients in particular show a specific pattern suggesting that potentially 30% of cases of dementia among the black Medicare recipients do not get diagnosed or treated This disparity in the diagnosis between races appears to be specific to dementia and does not appear in the reported schizophrenia or depression prevalence rates. Further researc h should seek to understand the factors driving the underdiagnosis and undertreatment of dementia in the black communities of our counties Abstract # 13 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 13 REPURPOSING ORAL -LACTAMS FOR THE TREATMENT OF LUNG DISEASE CAUSED BY NON MYCOBACTERIA [1, 2, 3] [1] Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack Meridian Health, Nutley, New Jersey, USA [2] Department of Medical Sciences, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, Nutley, New Jersey, USA [3] Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA Lung disease caused by Non -Tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) is increasingly prevalent and poses a threat to public health. Current treatment options invo lve prolonged courses of multiple antibiotics, including injectables, with poor outcomes. Novel more efficacious and oral treatments are urgently needed. In this study, we aimed to repurpose clinically approved or in - development oral -lactams for the trea tment of NTM pulmonary disease. We performed a screen of oral -lactams with or without oral -lactamase inhibitors. Growth inhibition against reference strains and clinical isolates was measured in Middlebrook 7H9 broth. Several - lactams were identified as actives. Pairwise combination of active -lactams revealed synergistic couples. These findings suggest that the identified -lactams and their combinations have the potential to be repurposed for treating NTM lung disease. The repurposing of clinically approved or in-development oral -lactams could expedite the development of new, more efficacious and oral regimes .

Arriaga, PharmD, Alexandria Berns, PharmD, Kimberly Carver, PharmD, BCPS; Christine Isler, PharmD All authors are affiliated with Hackensack Meridian Health Background: Despite increasing efforts, heart failure readmission rates within 30 days after hospitalization remains a challenge. Ocean University Medical Center (OUMC) heart failure (HF) 30 -day year to date (YTD) readmission is 14.63% as of May 2022. It has been documented that a follow -up within 7 days after discharge from a heart fai lure hospitalization is associated with lower 30 -day readmission. Studies have shown that pharmacist involvement in admission and discharge medication review, as well as discharge counseling, demonstrated an absolute risk reduction in readmissions for HF p atients. OUMC has initiated a pharmacy unit -based initiative to counsel patients and find opportunities to optimize guideline recommended therapy. Another key component of the pharmacy initiative is a telephone follow up 7 days after discharge. The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacy HF unit -based initiative impact on 30 - day heart failure readmissions at OUMC Methods: his study is a retrospective chart review of patients that received a diagnosis of heart failure or heart failure exac erbation at OUMC between April 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022. Data was collected from business intelligence reports and manual chart review in Epic. Information was collected to assess rates of readmission within 30 days of discharge. Data was also collect ed to determine what pharmacy interventions were most common. All patients admitted with a new diagnosis or exacerbation of heart failure were included in the study. Patients were excluded from the study if: they were admitted from or discharged to facilit ies such as hospital transfers, long term care facilities, and subacute/acute rehab facilities, had expired during care, or were discharged to hospice care. Results: A total of 182 patients met the inclusion criteria. The primary end point of readmission after pharmacy counseling was 12.8% vs 23.1% of patients readmitted without counseling. There were 1.6% less overall readmissions in patients after the implementation of the counseling initiative compared to before it was implemented, however this was not statistically significant (p = 0.074). Patients with HFrEF were statistically significantly less likely to be readmitted within 30 days when they were discharged with additional heart failure medications (95%CI, -1.34 to - 0.126). Conclusion: There have b een numerous studies on pharmacist inclusive heart failure management published that have resulted in decreased readmission rates and higher rates of optimized therapy. The results of this study provide more support on the benefits of pharmacist involvemen t on the quality of care and reduction of readmission in patients with heart failure.

ANDEXANET [2] JFK University Medical Center, NJ; [3] Southern Ocean Medical Center, NJ Background: Andexanet alfa is the FDA -approved agent for the reversal of apixaban and rivaroxaban, but recent studies show 4F -PCC may possess similar efficacy for this indication. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of 4F -PCC vs. andexanet al fa for the reversal of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) associated with apixaban and rivaroxaban. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on 418 patients from four New Jersey hospitals over a 3 year period. The primary endpoint was hemostatic ef ficacy, defined as stability on CT head scan at 24 hours [18 -30 hours] following administration of 4F -PCC or andexanet alfa. Secondary endpoints were incidence of in -hospital thrombotic events and in -hospital mortality. Inclusion criteria were patients 18 years old, use of apixaban or rivaroxaban within 18 hours of hospital presentation, presence of ICH confirmed on CT head scan, and administration of 4F -PCC or andexanet alfa for ICH reversal. Patients with non -ICH bleeding or patients who did not have a f ollow -up CT scan within the 18 -30 hours time window following administration of 4F -PCC or andexanet alfa were excluded. Results: Of the 418 patient charts reviewed, 59 patients met inclusion criteria [4F -PCC: 29 (49.2%); andexanet alfa: 30 (50.8%)]. There was no statistical difference in CT stability at 24 hours for 4F -PCC vs. andexanet alfa [23(79.3%) vs. 26(86.7%)]. Additionally, there was no difference between 4F -PCC vs. andexanet alfa in the incidence of in -hospital thrombotic events [1(3.4%) vs. 0(0%) ] or in -hospital morality (6(20.7%) vs. 9(30%)]. Conclusion: This retrospective comparison suggests that there is no difference in efficacy or safety between 4F -PCC and andexanet alfa for the reversal of ICH related to apixaban and rivaroxaban use. A majo r limitation is that this study is likely underpowered due to small sample size. Prospective, head -to-head trials comparing 4F -PCC vs. andexanet alfa are still needed to more effectively compare their efficacy and safety in this patient population.

Hoffmann, Brendan J. Hammond, BS, Saahil S. Patel, BS, Yousef Masoudpoor, Robert G. Pergolizzi , PhD, Thomas Bernik, MD Department of Vascular Surgery, Englewood Health, 350 Engle Street, Englewood, NJ 07631 [all authors] Purpose: The saphenous vein graft (SVG) has been the conduit of choice for over 50 years, but its lack of availability makes it s superior utility unreliable. Because of the paucity of autologous vein grafts and poor results of alternative bypass conduits, we hypothesized vein allografts can be used for patients with limb -threatening ischemia who do not have adequate vein conduit f or restorative bypass surgery. Despite substantial improvements in outcomes in the past decade, graft patency and conduit availability remain the 'Achilles' heel' of this procedure. Remodeling processes of the vein graft start within days after harvesting and grafting, leading to the formation of intimal hyperplasia; the primary cause of intermediate -phase vein graft stenosis and occlusion. Even autologous saphenous vein grafts are affected, leading to poor long -term patency, with handling and preimplantati on treatment having an impact on mean time to failure. Materials and Methods: To study the question of how to treat vessels for implantation such that they are less \"visible\" to the immune system, we have developed an IRB/IACUC -approved model in which hu man saphenous vein segments are grafted into rats via infra -renal inter - positional aorta grafts, after subjecting the veins to various treatments intended to extend patency. This reverse xenograft model accelerates the rate of failure due to the extreme difference in species biomarkers. We have performed SVGs on 47 Sprague -Dawley rats, using either no pretreatment, or one of several pretreatment cocktails including various fixatives, agents, nucleases, proteases and alcohols, at varying conc entrations for periods of time from 1 to 9 months. Results: Preliminary data from our lab shows a strong immune reaction to the implantation of human SVG, as expected. Control rats (SVGs with no pretreatment), show serious degradation as early as 2 weeks after grafting. All the pretreated vessels appeared superior to controls, with some demonstrating minimal intimal hyperplasia out to the longest time points tested. Conclusions: We have successfully tested the hypothesis that human saphenous vein segme nts can be subjected to pre -treatment such that when they are implanted into rats, they will retain greater patency and have improved histological and physiological performance at 3, 6 and 9 months compared to controls. This research has significant implic ations for graft patency and retention in clinical applications. Abstract # 17 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 17 COMPARISON OF HIGH - AND LOW - DOSE OF FOUR -FACTOR PROTHROMBIN COMPLEX PharmD, BCPS, BCCCP JFK University Medical Center The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of a P& T (pharmacy and therapeutics) approved dosing protocol implementing a low -dose (25 units/kg) of 4F -PCC compared to high for factor Xa inhibitor -associated intracranial hemorrhage. A retrospective chart review was conducted for a six mont h period pre -implementation of the P&T approved 25 units/kg dosing for 4F -PCC and for a six month period post -implementation of the protocol. Patients 18 years and older were included if they received 4F -PCC for reversal of factor Xa inhibitor -associated and epidural hematoma (EDH), administration of andexanet alfa, and pregnancy. The primary outcome assessed was hemostatic efficacy at 24 hours between patients receiving 50 units/kg versus 25 units/ kg, and safety was assessed by evaluating the presence of thrombotic events (stroke, DVT, and PE) between the groups. Descriptive statistics was used to evaluate the data. A total of 18 patients were included, with 9 patients in each group. The median 4F -PCC dose in the pre - protocol group was 48.7 units/kg (median total dose was 3738 units) compared to 26 units/kg (median dose 1599 units) in the post -protocol group. There was 1 patient in the post -protocol group who received desmopressin, while no other rev ersal agents or blood products were given in either group. The percentage of patients who achieved good or excellent hemostasis at 24 hours from baseline was similar between the two groups (pre -protocol: 6 patients [75%]; post - protocol: 8 patients [89%]). Safety outcomes were also similar, with only 1 patient in each group experiencing a DVT post -administration of 4F -PCC. The implementation of a P&T approved dosing protocol utilizing a lower dose of 25 units/kg of 4F -PCC for factor Xa inhibitor - associated i ntracranial hemorrhage seems to be as safe and effective as higher doses of 50 units/kg. Similar outcomes were seen in hemostatic efficacy at 24 hours as well as in the incidence of thrombotic events between both groups. This study is limited by its small sample size, and larger studies are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of this dosing strategy.

Similar results were not seen in the elderly due to varied genetic makeup and lesser tolerance to aggressive pediatr ic-based treatment regimens. Lately, with (TKIs), Inotuzumab ozogamicin, Blinatumomab, CAR -T, improvements in survival have been noted. Our objective was to describe survival trends among elderly diagnosed with ALL. We also described survival outcomes based on demographics and genetic features. Methods: We identified patients with ALL aged 65 years from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database for 2000 -2018 using WHO ICD -O-3 codes. Gender, age , race, immunophenotype, genetics, prior malignancy status, year of diagnosis, survival months, vital status, until the study cutoff (December 31, 2019) were collected. Years of diagnosis were divided into three study time periods (TP) [2000 -2006 (TP1), 20 07-2011(TP2), 2012 -2018 (TP3)]. Survival analysis was done using a Cox -proportional hazard regression model. Gender and immunophenotypic groups were not significant on univariate analysis and were not included in the multivariate analysis. Survival curves were plotted for each TPs by Kaplan -Meier method and were compared using log -rank test. Survival estimate were further compared for each TP for each subgroup of race, gender, immunophenotype and age group with the posthoc comparison between each TP. The po sthoc adjusted p value are calculated by bonferroni correction. Results: Total of 26801 patients with ALL were identified. 10.02% (n=2986) were 65 years. After excluding cases with incomplete information (n=50), 2936 patients were included. 50.44% (n=148 1) were female. 69.17% (n=2089) patients were Non -Hispanic Whites (NHW). ALL presented as secondary malignancy in 27.45% (n=806) patients. 90.63% (n=2661) patients had B-Lymphoblastic leukemia. In terms of genetic mutations (data available only after 2010) , t(9;22) positive diseases were 8.25% (n=139). In the survival analysis, superior outcomes were seen in patients with t(9;22) [HR 0.68 (95%CI 0.55 -0.84)] with reference to B -Lymphoblastic Leukemia, NOS. Inferior outcomes were seen when ALL was diagnosed a s secondary malignancy [HR 1.16 (95% CI 1.07 - 1.27)] and Black [HR 1.29 (95% CI(1.09 -1.52)] with reference to NHW. Survival trends improved over the study TPs 2000 -2006 (Ref), 2007 0.58 -0.71)]. Conclusion: Prognosis for elderly diagnosed with ALL has improved in last two decades. Notable improvements are seen in patients with t(9;22), owing to TKIs. Study outlines racial disparity. There are unmet needs of improvement in age >75 years and patients with T -cell immunophenotype.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a medical condition impacting everyone from all walks of life having no discrimination of income level, race, social class, or gender. OUD is an unprecedented medical and public health crisis in New Jersey, as well as the United States with numbers from the Centers for Disease Control Estimating 2.7 million people a ges 12 or older, reported having OUD in the United States in 2020. The percentage of those reported using opioids has significantly increased in the last decade. To combat this epidemic medications and treatment modalities have been implemented throughout New Jersey including: Medication Assisted treatment programs, Office Based Addiction treatment programs, and other treatment modalities. Deaths from drug overdose continue to significantly contribute to mortality in New Jersey as well as in the United Stat es. The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) tracks trends in drug overdose deaths for all drugs and for specific drugs and drug types and identifies changes in rates by state. A recent report noted that from 2017 to 2018 the drug overdose death rate wa s higher in 2018 than in 2017 for only 5 states including California, Delaware, Missouri, New Jersey, and South Carolina. The age -adjusted rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, which include drugs such as fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and tramadol, increased from 0.3 per 100,000 standard population in 1999 to 1.0 in 2013, 1.8 in 2014, 3.1 in 2015, 6.2 in 2016, 9.0 in 2017, and 9.9 in 2018. Additionally, the national 12 Month -ending Provisional Counts of Drug Overdose D eaths sourced by the National Center for Health Statistics reported for March 2019 at 67727 deaths, comparatively to March 2020 the reported number of 74679 and in March 2022 that number was at a staggering 107560. Results: Patients with OUD who contracte d COVID -19 fared worse than their COPD, DM suffering counterparts, Disease outcomes which were determined to be the duration of hospitalization and mortality rate. Methods: Data sourced from our hospital EMR (EPIC) and surveyed hospital admissions that sp an from mid -March 2020 until mid -March 2023 focusing on COVID -19 admissions in patients with OUD and those without. Two groups examined focusing on mortality rate and duration of hospitalization. Conclusion: Given the recent pandemic, it would be prudent to regard OUD patients as a vulnerable population, which would require specialized care in both inpatient and outpatient settings in order to mitigate the poor outcomes that were seen in our survey, thereby lessening the disease burden on both patients and the medical system.

Ayrton Bangolo, MD [1] [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Palisades Medical Center, NJ; [2] Department of Epidemiology, Human Genetic s & Environmental Sciences, UTHealth School of Public Health, Texas; [3] Department of Hematology/Oncology, Palisades Medical Center, NJ Background: Several studies on the associations between socioeconomic status (SES), race/ethnicity, and surgical type/delays with colon cancer -specific and all -cause mortality abound, though with contrasting reports. This study sought to examine and expand on previou s findings. Also, we quantified the extent to which these differences, especially the surgery type performed, explained the racial/ethnic disparities in colon cancer mortality. Methods: We studied 111,789 adult patients 45 years old with a histological d iagnosis of colon cancer between 2010 and 2017, identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. To examine the association of SES and race/ethnicity with surgical treatment type and delays, we performed logistic regression models. We also performed mediation analysis models to quantify the extent to which mortality differences were mediated by sociodemographic, treatment, and clinicopathologic factors. The SEER database is a publicly available dataset for which the need for IRB approval was waived. Results: Non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =1.19, 95% -1.25] were significantly more likely to undergo subtotal colectomy and to experience treatment delays [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.31 -1.48] compared to NH Hispanics odds ratio (AOR) = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.49 -1.69], like NHB, were also more likely to experience treatment delays than were NHWs. Patients in the highest SES quintile were more likely to undergo partial colectomy and this was found to be protective by ensuring lower colon cancer specific mortality (CCSM) and All -cause mortality (AcM) rates for this group in comparison to those in the lowest SES quintile who majorly underwent subtotal colectomy. Conclusion: To ens ure access to adequate and timely healthcare services for all towards reducing the disproportionate burden of colon cancer on men, minority races and the poor, we would need a multidisciplinary approach that addresses several treatment and social factors t hat perpetuate these differences.

With the established association between renal parameters and COVID -19 mortality, the study aimed to compare the predictive ability of pulmonary and renal para meters and identify the most effective combination of parameters for accurate COVID -19 mortality prediction. Methods: In this retrospective study, all patients admitted to a tertiary hospital \"FNKV\" between September 1st, 2020 and December 31st, 2020, who were clinically symptomatic and tested positive for COVID -19, were included. We gathered extensive data on patient admissions, including laboratory results, comorbidities, chest X -rays (CXR) images, and SpO2 levels, to determine their role in predicting m ortality. Experienced radiologists evaluated the CXR images and assigned a score from 0 to 18 based on the severity of COVID -19 pneumonia. Further, we categorized patients into two independent groups based on their renal function using the RIFLE and KDIGO criteria to define the AKI and CKD groups. The first group (\"AKI&CKD\") was subdivided into six sub -groups: normal renal and Grade 4+5 CKD (F). The second group was based only on eGFR at the admission and thus it was divided into four grades: Grade 1, Grade 2+3a, Grade 3b, and Grade 4+5. Results: The cohort comprised 619 patients. Patients who died during hospitalization had a significantly higher mean radiological score ( 8.6) compared to those who survived (7.1), with a P - value < 0.01. Moreover, we observed that the risk for mortality was significantly increased as renal function deteriorated, as evidenced by the AKI&CKD and eGFR groups. In the \"AKI&CKD\" group the mortalit y was as follows: Group A (231 patients) 7.8%, group B (138 patients) 19.6%, group C (112 patients) 22.3%, group D (31 patients) 41.9%, group E (78 patients) 55.1%, and group F (29 patients) 69.0% (P<0.01). The mortality in the eGFR group was the following : Group 1 (147 patients) 7.5%, group 2 (324 patients) 21.0%, group 3 (67 patients) 37.3%, and group 4 (81 patient) 51.9% (p<0.01). Regarding mortality prediction, the area under the curve (AUC) for renal parameters (AKI&CKD group, eGFR group, and age) was found to be superior to that of pulmonary parameters (age, radiological score, SpO2, CRP, and D -dimer) with an AUC of 0.8068 versus 0.7667. However, when renal and pulmonary parameters were combined, the AUC increased to 0.8813. Conclusions: Our study dem onstrated that selected renal parameters are superior to pulmonary parameters in predicting COVID -19 mortality for patients requiring hospitalization. When combining both renal and pulmonary factors, the predictive ability of mortality significantly improv ed.

Jennifer Nguyen [1], Teona Iarajuli Meridian Medical Center, NJ [2] Department of Urology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, NY [3] Department of Urology, the University of Texas Health San Antonio, TX [4] Central Ohio Urology Group, OH [5] Department of Urology, Lewis Katz School of Medicine Temple University, PA [6] Division of Urology, Mount Sinai Medical Center, FL [7] Department of Urology, Wake Forest University School of Medicine, NC [8] Department of Urology, Providence St. Joseph's Health, WA [9] Departme nt of Urology, University of Illinois, IL Purpose: We aim to evaluate the utilization of partial nephrectomy (PN) and radical nephrectomy (RN). In addition, we examined the differences in outcomes for patients 75 years undergoing PN vs RN. Materials and Methods: We utilized a prospectively, maintained multi -institutional database of patients that underwent PN or RN between 2006 and 2022. Baseline characteristics, perioperative, and postoperative outcomes were analyzed using the 2 test, Fisher's exact te st, Mood's median test, Mann Whitney U test, Kruskal Wallis test, and student's t -test. Results: (14.15%) RN. of PN in those 75yr (80.72%, <0.001). Patients 75yr have increased comorbidities such (<0.001), diabetes (<0.001), and lower baseline eGFR (p=0.0001) relative to their younger cohort. In this same cohort, with PN, there is no increase in surgical margins or complication rates but does demonstrate a significant benefit in terms of GFR and GFR -6.71 vs. -19.35 (p= < 0.001). Conclusion: is decreased utilization of PN among the elderly (75yr) despite the need for PN given their comorbid indications that affect kidney function. In addition, PN is safe and feasible for select elderly patients. Our data suggests there is an age bias against performing PN in the elderly with no improvement in surgical outcomes compared to RN but does lead to a decrease in GFR and delta GFR for patients that do not undergo PN. Advanced age alone should not deter the use of PN in appropriately selected patients.

Sarah Brink [2] ; [1] Stifelman [1,2] Department of Urology, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, Nutley, NJ, USA [2] Department of Urology, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA Background: The Single Port (SP) robot is a new technology utilized in the treatment of many urologic conditions. Extrapolating from prior single -site laparoscopy data, there has been concern regarding increased incisional complications due to the size of the incision. This study seeks to evaluate SP incisional complications for renal, genitourinary reconstruction, b ladder, and prostate surgeries. Methods: IRB-approved prospective databases were queried to identify patients who underwent SP robotic surgery between 2019 and 2022. All patients included had documentation of incision location and a minimum of 3 -month fol low-up. Postoperative outcomes included evidence of incisional hernia, wound infection, and/or wound dehiscence. Subgroup analysis was performed by incision location. Results: 295 patients were analyzed. There were only 6 incisional complications (6/295, 2.0%), with 4 hernias, 2 wound infections, and 0 wound dehiscence. Among the 4 hernias, the highest incidence occurred via umbilical transperitoneal incision (3.4%, 2/58), followed by lower quadrant (LQ) finally by infraumbilical extraperitoneal were no and extraperitoneal 0.5%) groups had 1 wound infection each. Overall, transperitoneal incisions accounted fo r a 4.8% (4/84) incidence of wound complication versus extraperitoneal incisions, which accounted for 0.9% (2/211). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this represents the first descriptive study of SP incisional complications. Incisions that utilize an extrap eritoneal approach have very low risk of complication. When using a transperitoneal approach, both the umbilical and LQ incisions have low risk of hernia. Larger numbers and comparison data to multiport robotic surgery will help to better elucidate this si gnificance.

The goal of this study was to measure the impact of di aphragm plication surgery on the quality of life in patients who were diagnosed with diaphragmatic paralysis. Methods: A retrospective review of the medical records of 46 patients who underwent diaphragmatic plication surgery was performed. The review inc luded patients who experienced unilateral and bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Patients who underwent repeat diaphragm plication surgery were also included. Patients from the retrospective cohort were then contacted by telephone to answer the Dyspnea -12 (D-12) Questionnaire.. Patients were asked to recall the severity of their symptoms and quality of life pre -plication, 1 -month post -plication, and 6 - months post -plication. Severity of symptoms was ranked as either none, mild, moderate, or severe. Values we re then assigned to each rank as follows: none = 0, mild =1, moderate =2, severe = 3. Relative change and statistical significance were calculated with pre -plication measurements used as the baseline. Scores between pre -plication versus 1 -month post -plicat ion and 6 -months post -plication were then compared by Student's paired t -test. All tests were two - sided and statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: 46 patients were included in the study, from which 21 answered the Dyspnea -12 Questionnaire. Average scores from each component of the D -12 Questionnaire showed improvement in the severity of symptoms from pre -plication to 1 -month post plication. The latter period was then followed by continued improvement in all areas when symptoms 6 -months post plication were assessed. Conclusion: In patients with diaphragmatic paralysis, diaphragm plication was effective in reducing patients' symptoms while improving overall quality of life.

Sanzari Children's Hospital, Hackensack University Medical Center and Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine [2] Department of Pediatrics, Division of Rheumatology, Children's Hospital at Montefiore [3] Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine Backgroun d: Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) is theorized to occur in a genetically susceptible individual as a response to an environmental trigger, and several viruses have been linked to the underlying pathophysiology of JDM, including reports of SARS -CoV -2 infect ion associated with both initial episodes and flares of JDM around the world. Our objective was to investigate the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on our population of JDM patients and evaluate the number of new JDM diagnoses and JDM flares during the pand emic, as compared to 5 years pre -pandemic. Methods: Patients 21 years and younger diagnosed with JDM between June 2015 and December 2022 were identified using the ICD -10 code M33. Data were collected retrospectively comparing manifestations of JDM patient s' initial presentations and flares pre -pandemic (6/1/15 -2/28/20) as well as during the pandemic (3/1/20 -12/30/22). Information about known COVID -19 exposures and infections preceding a flare or initial diagnosis was assessed. Flare episodes were character ized by clinical symptoms, physical exam findings, pertinent labs, and medications at the time of flare. Exploratory data analysis was used to explore potential relationships between flares occurring before and during the pandemic using summary statistics, univariate and bivariate analysis. Results: Seventeen patients diagnosed with JDM were identified; 8 pre -pandemic and 9 during the pandemic. Fifteen flares were captured from 12 patients, of which 87% (13/15) occurred during the pandemic. Of those JDM pa tients diagnosed pre -pandemic, 78% of their flares occurred during the pandemic. Of the 12 patients who experienced flares, 80% of these patients experienced at least one flare, while 25% experienced more than one flare during the pandemic. Fifteen percent of patients who experienced flare had a medication (Methotrexate) held for COVID -19 vaccination; 55% of our patients were vaccinated. Two patients had documented COVID -19 infections preceding flare. The majority of flares occurred during the time period w hen Omicron variants of COVID -19 were predominant (12/1/21 to 12/30/2022). Conclusion: The majority of flares in this study period occurred during the pandemic. Although a minority of patients had documented COVID -19 infection preceding flare, most flares occurred during the time when Omicron variants were predominant; therefore, these patients may have had undocumented or asymptomatic COVID -19 infections that potentially triggered flares. Holding immunomodulating medications to optimize immune response to COVID -19 vaccination may have also potentially contributed to flares. An increase in telehealth visits during the pandemic may have also led to suboptimal monitoring and disease control in JDM potentially modulating the number of JDM flares during the pan demic. Future investigation of COVID -19's impact in larger cohorts would elucidate correlations between the pandemic, COVID -19 infections, and vaccinations with JDM flares.

Sanzari Children's Hospital, Hackensack Meridian Health, Hackensack, NJ 07601, [2] Center for Discovery and Innovation, Hackensack Meridian Health, Nutley, NJ 07110, [3] Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, Nutley, NJ 07110. Background: PFAPA, a disease of immune dysregulation affecting oral mucosa/lymphoid tissue, is the most common recurrent fever syndrome in childhood with frequent delays in diagnosis due to limited understanding of its pathogen esis. The objective of this study is to identify the optimal method of oral sample collection that would allow the characterization of cellular and molecular immune profiling in oral mucosa and in blood for future oral mucosal eluc spit, and buccal swabbing collection methods were assessed to determine which would result in the highest yield of protein, RNA (extracted using TRIzol reagent), and/or live cells. After establish ing the collection method with the highest yield of live cells, immune cell subsets detected via flow cytometry were compared in this collection method versus in blood. Major myeloid and lymphoid subsets were characterized collection kit resulted in the highest cell yield (~5 x 105 cells/mL), and RNA yield (~400 ng/L). The Children's Swab collection kit resulted in the highest protein yield. A Buccal Swab and blood sample from a healthy control were compared via flow cytometry, and, similar to blood, cell subtypes including B cells, NK cells, T cell subsets, neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes in buccal specimens were differentiated. Conclusion: These pilot experiments demonstrate that salivary protein production is sufficiently robust to determine if saliva can be a surrogate to blood in cytokine analysis in future PFAPA studies. While there is insufficient cell yield from saliva, buccal sampling did have an ample cell yield to perform flow cytometry. The ease of oral mucosal sample collection in pediatric patients may serve as a paradigm for future translational science research.

In July 2021, ACOG formally recommended vaccination against COVID -19 for pregnant patients, and encouraged OBGYN prov iders to document vaccination status in patients' electronic medical records. Resident compliance with ACOG's novel guideline regarding vaccination in pregnancy against COVID -19 has yet to be studied. Our national survey sought to assess OBGYN resident cou nseling trends and barriers towards COVID -19 vaccination in pregnancy. Methods: In April 2022, a national survey was sent to all ACGME accredited OBGYN residency programs in the United States. Responses were obtained and descriptive analysis was performed. Results: The majority of OBGYN residents supported COVID -19 vaccination in pr egnancy (96.1%, n=73). In the clinic setting, most residents counseled pregnant patients about COVID -19 vaccination at least 50% of the time (97.4%, n=74). Of that subgroup, 78% (n=58) counseled patients 100% of the time for vaccination. Amongst the reside nts who reported times during which counseling was not performed (17%, n=13), the most frequent reason identified was insufficient time during prenatal visits (84%, n=11). Over half of residents cited that the COVID - 19 vaccine was unavailable in their resi dent clinic (52.6%, n=40). Conclusion: Outpatient clinics are ideal locations for vaccination counseling. While residency clinics see high volumes of pregnant patients, a resident perceived barrier to standardization of counseling includes inadequate pren atal visit time as well as lack of in -office COVID -19 vaccine availability. Overall trends are reassuring, with over 95% reported adherence to ACOG recommended counseling guidelines.

In 2019, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has spearheaded an initiative to improve diversity and inclusio n in residency training programs. Shortly thereafter, major national healthcare networks across the United States have established Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) committees. The impact of residency DEI committees on applicant ranking has yet to be st udied. Our qualitative short survey aimed to assess the perceived level of importance of DEI committees for underrepresented in medicine (URiM) OBGYN residency applicants. Methods: Our OBGYN residency program hosted a webinar for URiM applicants. A post - webinar survey was administered after the rank submission deadline, asking to self -report the extent to which the presence of a DEI committee influenced the applicants' ranking of pr ograms. Responses were measured using a five -point Likert scale. Results: Thirty URiM residency applicants attended the webinar. Half of survey respondents reported the presence of a diversity, equity and inclusion committee (DEI) as being not influential in their rank preference (50%, n=6). Conclusion: While DEI committees have recently become a metric for URiM support, it is plausible that their existence is more so viewed as a marker of performative activism, rather than that of genuine support. The li mitations of our data include that of a small sample size; however, the implications of the preliminary results can drive further qualitative assessments of hospital - based DEI committees.

The objective was to determine flow rate and duration of an improvised oxygen tank using equipment from an anesthesia machine. Methods: inflating 3 Liter Anesthesia Reservoir bags, 2 bags were inflated to 40 liters, 2 bags were inflated to 50 liter, 2 liter 60 liters. each bag was then connected to a nasal cannula with flow rate measure via Wright respirometer and stop watch. Results: All improvised oxygen bags demonstrated a nasal cannula flow rate of 4 liters per minutes or greater for 10 minutes. 40 Liter bags had flow rates only measurable up to 10 minutes. 50 liter bags were able to provide flow rates >4 lpm up to 12 minutes; thereafter, flow rate dropped off significantly. 60 liter bags were able to provide >5 lpm for 15 minutes Conclusion: In the transfer period from OR to PACU, this method would be an alternative to an oxygen tank, provided only low flow O2 is desired. Th is will help facilitate OR turnover as it uses equipment readily available with no additional cost. The setup is quick and easy to prepare; if no more than low flow nasal cannula is required, when oxygen tanks are not available, this is a reasonable substi tution.

[1], and Jesus Alvarez Perez, MD [1] [1] Hackensack University Medical Center Background: Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) is associated with fewer maternal complications than elective repeat cesarean delivery with a varying success rate of 65 -83.3%, but a failed TOLAC is associated with increased maternal and fetal risks. The aim of this s tudy was to determine the VBAC success rate of a single provider group at a large academic institution, as well as the patient characteristics associated with successful VBAC deliveries. Method: This IRB -approved retrospective chart review assessed 318 pr egnant patients, with 304 meeting the inclusion criteria. All patients had elected for a TOLAC with a single provider group at one large academic institution between 2002 to 2014. Charts were reviewed and the data was analyzed in order to determine the fac tors influencing the success of VBAC Results: Of the 304 patients, the VBAC success rate was 87.5% and correlated with a significantly lower BMI (earliest recorded p=0.0075; at delivery p=0.0009), which did not correspond with EFW or neonatal weight diffe rences. Previous successful vaginal and VBAC deliveries, gestational diabetes, induction, and cervical dilation at induction did not correlate with failed TOLAC. Demographic and clinical characteristics of our study population were predominantly caucasian (87.17%), non -Hispanic (97.04%), Jewish (85.2%), and insured (82.8%) with a mean age at delivery of 30.59\u00b14.81. A failed VBAC was associated with a higher EBL (p<0.0001) and a lower 1 -minute Apgar score (p=0.0002). Conclusion: The VBAC success rate of a p redominantly caucasian, non -Hispanic, Jewish, and insurance population was 87.5%. VBAC success correlated with a significantly lower BMI. Understanding the factors that impact VBAC outcomes as well as individual patient desires is necessary to appropriatel y counsel patients and engage in shared decision making regarding their delivery plan following a cesarean section.

Kasselman [2], Morga n R. Peltier[1,3,4] [1]Department of Psychiatry, Ocean University Medical Center [2]Department of Research, Hackensack Meridian Health Research Institute [3]Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine. [4] Depart ment of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Jersey Shore University Medical Center Major Depressive Disorder is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental health disorders. Although numerous studies have looked at genetic predispositions to the condition, in recent years, there has been an increased interest on the impact of environmental factors (eg. food, pollution, media use and climate change) on risk of depression. Flame retardants are one of the \"dirty dozen\" pollutants that are especially prevalent in the environment and have structural similarity to thyroid hormones whose dysfunction is also associated with depression. High levels of Polybrominated Diphenyl Ether -47, a flame retardant that is detectible in ~100% of people, has recently bee n found to increase the risk of postpartum depression, however, its effects on other mental disorders is less clear. Therefore, we examined how plasma levels of PBDE -47 may correlate with increased risk of depression. Data from the 2003 -2004 National Healt h and Nutrition Examination Survey was used for this study and consisted of a nationally representative subsample of 691 adults ages 20 - 39 years, that had PBDE -47 levels measured from blood by isotope dilution gas chromatography high -resolution mass spec trometry. Survey respondents also completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 2.1 that was used to identify cases of depression. PBDE concentrations were ranked into quartiles and their association with risk of depression was evaluat ed via logistic regression. We found that PBDE -47 levels in the 3rd quartile were at significantly increased risk for CIDI scores that are suggestive of depression (OR: 16.68, 95%, CI: 1.29, 216.86; P = 0.034). This study suggests that higher levels of PBD E exposure may increase the risk of depression, however, the association was non -monotonic and is likely inverse U -shaped. Our findings are limited by the small sample size and the inability to adjust for confounding variables such as sex, race -ethnicity a nd poverty that are also associated with depression. Therefore, a study of a larger cohort of patients with more details regarding depression level, medications consumed and other confounding variables is warranted.

Relevant anticoagulation guidelines currently do no t have concrete guidance regarding underweight dosing of prophylactic enoxaparin. On the contrary, patients who are morbidly obese are recommended to be given higher doses due to a higher volume of distribution. Thus, it is hypothesized that underweight pa tients have a lower volume of distribution which correlates to a higher serum enoxaparin concentration increasing the risk of bleeding. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the incidence of bleeding and thrombosis among underweight patients who receive d low -dose versus standard -dose of prophylactic enoxaparin. This is a retrospective, single -center, IRB -exempt cohort study conducted in a 231 - bed community hospital. Patients were identified via chart review using the hospital's electronic medical record system. Inclusion criteria consist of adults 18 years and older with a reported body mass index of less than 18.5 kg/m2 or a total body weight of less than 45 kilograms. Patients were excluded if enoxaparin was given for less than 48 hours, had an active b leed prior to administration of enoxaparin, were contraindicated to pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis, or were receiving hemodialysis. The intervention group received low dose or 30 mg of enoxaparin daily while the control group received standard dose or 40 mg enoxaparin daily. The primary outcomes include a composite endpoint of thrombosis and bleeding, and stratified endpoints on the incidence of thrombosis alone or bleeding alone. Secondary outcomes in this study include mortality during admission and the av erage length of stay. An additional outcome assessed the association between bleeding incidence and renal impairment. Of the 251 patients included in the study, 172 (68.5%) were female, and the median age was 80 years. There were 114 (45.4%) patients who r eceived low -dose while 137 (54.6%) received standard -dose enoxaparin. For the composite outcome, 30 (26.31%) patients in the intervention group and 30 (21.9%) patients in the control group experienced either thrombosis or bleeding [X2(1, n = 251) =0.668, p = .41]. For the stratified outcomes, 26 (22.8%) patients in the intervention group and 28 (20.4%) patients in the control group experienced bleeding alone [X2(1, n=251) = 0.21, p = .65]. Meanwhile, 6 (5.3%) patients in the intervention group and 2 (1.5%) patients in the control group experienced thrombosis alone [X2(1, n=251) = 2.92, p =.08]. Mortality during admission was significantly higher in the intervention group. Other secondary outcomes were deemed non - significant. In this cohort study of underweig ht adults receiving venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, the incidence of bleeding, thrombosis, or both bleeding and thrombosis did not yield any significant difference between low -dose prophylactic enoxaparin as compared to standard - dose prophylactic enoxa parin.

The objective of this project was to compare quantitative blood loss and estimated blood loss values during vaginal deliveries with calculated blood loss determined by maternal hematocrit before and after delivery. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included all term, spontaneous vaginal deliveries of singleton infants to patients 18 years or older who delivered at a single community -based tertiary center between August 2019 and December 2020. Estimated blood loss (EBL) or quantitative blood loss (QBL) were obtained from delivery summary notes. Charts were exclu ded if there was no predelivery or postdelivery blood work or if maternal height or weight were not documented. Data was abstracted from Epic electronic medical records. Calculated blood loss (cEBL) was determined using the formula derived by Stafford et. al. in 2008: cEBL) = Calculated Pregnancy Blood Volume x Percent of Blood Volume Lost Calculated Pregnancy Volume = (0.75 ([Maternal Ht (in) x 50] + [Maternal Wt (lbs) - Postdelivery Hematocrit) Predelivery H EBL and cEBL and between QBL and cEBL were evaluated by using linear regression analysis. Results: One thousand, six hundred and sixty seven charts met inclusion criteria. Of these 1667, 670 had a documented QBL (40.2%) and 99 7 had a documented EBL (60.9%). The association between cEBL and QBL using simple linear regression was a poor fit with an R -square of 0.206. EBL and cEBL also had a poor association using linear regression with an R -square of 0.0941. By using R -square, QB L can predict better than EBL, however both are poor predictors of blood loss calculated from predelivery and postdelivery hematocrit. Conclusion: ACOG defines PPH as a blood loss measuring 1000mL for both vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections. As many as 54 -93% of these deaths are reported to be preventable. These statistics have led to an agenda to improve maternal morbidity and mortality due to hemorrhage. EBL has been the standard when determining blood loss, however studies have found that provider s often underestimate larger blood losses and over estimate lower blood losses. Gravimetric tools have been developed to obtain a more objective QBL. Many studies hypothesize that quantitative calculations of blood loss as being more accurate compared to t he widely used estimated blood loss. No studies have directly compared the accuracy of QBL versus EBL in determining the expected decrease in hematocrit. This study aims to show that QBL is more useful in accessing the decrease in a patient's hematocrit, w hich may decrease patient morbidity and mortality, however both QBL and EBL showed a poor association with calculated blood loss measures.

Background: Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt(TIPS) is a procedure employed in patients in the management of portal hyperten sion refractory to medical management. The impact of frailty on the use of TIPS and its outcomes is not well studied. Frailty is a clinical syndrome representing a decreased physiologic reserve to handle stressors and is a significant risk factor for adver se outcomes in hospitalized patients. This study aimed to investigate the impact of frailty on TIPS utilization, inpatient mortality, and the rate of 30 -day readmission in patients with alcohol -related cirrhosis. Methods: A retrospective cohort study usin g the Nationwide Readmission Database from 2016 - 2019 was conducted, using International Classification of Diseases 10th code (ICD -10) to identify patients admitted with alcohol -related cirrhosis. Patients were classified as frail and non - frail using the Gi lbert Frailty Index. The impact of frailty on TIPS utilization, inpatient mortality, and 30 -day readmission was analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate regression models. Results: Between 2016 and 2019, 139,699 individuals were admitted for alcohol -related cirrhosis. Among these, 2,725 (1.95%) underwent a TIPS procedure, of which 57.61% (n=1,570) were classified as frail. No significant difference was found between 30 -day readmission rates among frail vs. non -frail patients (10.10% vs. 7.68% ; p=0.33). Regression modeling indicated that frail patients neither had higher odds of readmission (OR 1.08; 95% CI 0.74 -1.58, p=0.681) nor HR 1.51, 95% CI 0.81 compared to p atients. Conclusion: Our study showed that frailty was not associated with increased rates of 30 -day readmissions or risk of inpatient mortality, suggesting that frail patients may not necessarily be excluded from minimally invasive procedures such as TIP S. Nevertheless, additional prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings.

Background: Alcohol -associated cirrhosis (AC) is a major cause of liver failure. Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) has been shown to improve liver transplantation -free survival in cirrhotic patients with recurrent ascites. Aims: We aimed to evaluate the impact of our TIPS on 30 -day readmissions, inpat ient mortality, and length of stay in AC patients with ascites. Methods: The National Readmission Database was examined from 2016 to 2019 to identify patients diagnosed with AC and ascites who underwent TIPS treatment or medical management. Linear, logist ic, and Cox regression analyses were used to assess the outcomes. Results: 139,699 patients met the inclusion criteria, of which 1.95% (n=2,725) underwent TIPS. The average patient was a male (68.33%) with a mean age of 55.16 years (SD 10.53). Readmission s within 30 days were lower in patients who received TIPS compared to medical management(17.79% vs 22.40%, p -value = 0.002); Cox regression analysis revealed an 18% reduction in hazard 0.82, 95% CI -value =0.011). TIPS group (10.60% vs. 5.34%, p -value <0.001 ); however, Cox regression showed no statistically significant difference in hazard ratios (p=0.854). Length of stay was longer in the TIPS group (11.88 days vs. 6.60 days, p -value < 0.001). Conclus ion: The study concludes that TIPS insertion is associated with a significantly lower risk of 30 -day readmission compared to medical management in AC patients with ascites, although inpatient mortality rates and length of stay differ between the two groups .

It is used to monitor a patient's current he alth status or can be used to help aid in diagnosis of new pathologies. The traditional routine manual assay method has been largely replaced by the automated hematology analyzer. These automated hematology analyzers can generate reliable results when appr opriately calibrated. Manual differential evaluation of a peripheral smear by an expert permits assessment of blood cell morphology on a broad level. It may also be helpful in evaluating genetic, inflammatory, nutritional, and metabolic abnormalities inclu ding hemolysis, blood borne parasites, and neoplasia. Although a manual differential can be routinely done, it is usually reserved when further investigation is necessary. Our goal is to describe the blood smear ordering practices, review the currently ava ilable standard set of criteria for peripheral smear review, and emphasize the importance of evaluating and establishing appropriate screening criteria for manual blood smear reviews to improve the performance in a hematology laboratory and quality of pati ent care. We analyzed and compared 4 different blood smear review criteria: 1) International Consensus Group for Hematology Review (ICGHR), 2) Hackensack University Meridian Medical Center 2) Dahl Chase Criteria, 4) Comar Wide Limit Cut-off Criteria. We sh ow when developing screening criteria for peripheral smear review, two important principles should be followed: 1) reduction in the rate of false -negative values in order to ensure patient safety 2) reduction in the rate of smear review to an acceptable va lue to ensure laboratory efficiency as high rates overload professionals and can delay the release of results. Laboratory productivity inversely correlates to the number of smear reviews. The recommended blood smear review rate is described as 30%, however it is dependent on each institution. Due to each institution's laboratory facility equipment, workload, patient epidemiology, training, financial considerations, institutional regulatory policies, and teaching/educational considerations, a universal set o f blood smear review criteria is nearly impossible. To improve the efficiency and clinical value of the blood smear review, the institution, clinicians, pathologists, and laboratory staff should participate in the discussion to create a set of criteria for manual smear review. With advances in health care services such as launching new analyzers with greater accuracy and precision, it is important that labs take efforts to minimize manual peripheral smear review to improve productivity, efficiency, clinical value, and patient care. Therefore, the ICGHR criteria should be adjusted to meet the needs of each specific context.

Hence, patients with IBD, whom are immunocompromised either due to their disease state or pharmacologic agents -especially in the era of biologics -renders them more susce ptible to infection. We hypothesize that patients with IBD, given either the nature of their illness or the pharmacologic therapy they tend to be on, are at an increased risk of DKA. We hope to provide data on risk stratification and the consequent need fo r specific management altercations -for this special population, based upon their risk of DKA. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross -sectional analysis of adult patients hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of DKA, with and without a previous diagnosis o f IBD. This study was performed in adherence with the STROBE statement. The patient sample was selected from the National Inpatient Sample database for the years 2016 -2019. The ethnic, epidemiologic, and racial backgrounds of patients with IBD admitted for DKA were analyzed. The primary outcome was the prevalence of DKA amongst patients with IBD, secondary outcomes included the effect long -term corticosteroids had on DKA prevalence. Analysis was done using Revman statistical software. RESULTS: During the years of 2016 -2019 in the dataset, 607,541 patients were hospitalized for DKA, of which 2,650 (0.44%) had a concomitant diagnosis of IBD. As compared to the general population, Patients with IBD had an 11% increased risk of admission for DKA (O R: 1.11, CI:1.03 - 1.54, p<0.05). Patients hospitalized for DKA whom had concomitant IBD, had a 23% increased risk of admission for DKA if they were on long -term corticosteroids (OR: 1.23, CI:1.14 -1.68, p<0.05). Race/ethnicity (African Americans vs. Hispanic vs. White) or gender did not appear to have an effect on hospital admission for DKA. Upon Subgroup analysis of IBD -subtype, having either CD or UC did not appear to have a role in DKA admission risk. DISCUSSION: The study demonstrates the increased risk of DKA in persons with IBD and hence the need for a more focused approach to avoid complications in this subset of patients. Corticosteroids used in medical therapy for IBD may also play a role in the increased risk of the development of DKA. Current liter ature studies have described the impact of IBD on mortality in patients with DKA and the association of onset of diabetes in patients receiving. Our abstract clarifies and quantifies the risk of developing DKA in patients with IBD and in those receiving lo ng- term corticosteroids. Despite these, some limitations must be acknowledged. The lack of granularity on other immunomodulatory medications can introduce bias to our study. As seen herein, the need to develop effective clinical guidelines for monitoring a nd management of diabetic patients with IBD - especially those on steroids is immanent to reduce hospitalization.

ENDOSCOPIC SURVEILLANCE FOR - GRADE BARRETT'S [1] Department of Medicine, Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune City, New Jers ey, USA. [2] North Shore University Hospital, Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, New York, USA. Background: Despite the emergence of new eradication tools and techniques, there are few head -to-head comparisons among ablation modalities. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is a well-established and relatively less expensive treatment for dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE). In contrast, endoscopic surveillance is performed primarily to prevent low -grade dysplasia (LGD) progression to invasive malignancy for BE in patients whose gastroesophageal reflux has been controlled by surgery or proton pump inhibitors. We compare the efficacy of APC versus endoscopic surveillance in treating LGD BE. Methods: We reviewed the literature across major databa ses, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar, from inception till November 2022. Eligible studies included patients who had undergone APC and/or endoscopic surveillance. Patients with no baseline LGD or with only LGD were evaluated. Outcomes s uch as length of Barrett's esophagus, stricture formation, complete regression, and progression to dysplasia were assessed. We performed a statistical analysis on Raveman 4.3. The pooled estimate and mean difference were used for outcome estimation with a 95% confidence interval. Results: Five studies were included in our meta -analysis with a total of 347 patients. Pooled analysis showed that the odds of complete regression in patients undergoing APC were greater than endoscopic surveillance (OR 8.40 95% C I 2.93 to 24.07, P=<0.0001, I2 = 35%) (Forest plot 3). Similarly, the odds of Barrett's esophagus length reduction CI 1.14 to 39.41, P= 0.04, I = 0%) were more signif icant in the APC treatment group. (Forest plot 1 and 2). However, no statistically significant difference was observed in the progression to high -grade dysplasia in both the groups 2 (OR 0.57 95% CI 0.14 to 2.39, APC was found superior to endoscopic surveillance in terms of better complete regression, and reduction of BE length. However, stricture formation was higher with APC. There was no difference in terms of lowering the progression of dysplasia in both m odalities. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to validate the findings, including treatment with APC.

MULTIPORT PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY: 6 -MONTH INTERMEDIATE OUTCOMES Jennifer L Nguyen; Teona Iarajuli; Meridian of Medicine, Nutley, NJ, USA; [2] Department of Urology, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA; Background: This study aims to compare intermediate outcomes in patients following single port (SP) and multiport (MP) robotic -assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN). Methods: This prospective, single -center s tudy involved patients who underwent SP or MP RAPN (based on surgeon preference), performed by two surgeons between 2017 and 2022, with at least 6 months of follow -up. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate the difference in out comes between SP and MP, adjusting for the operating surgeon. Results: Overall, 48 patients underwent SP and 185 MP RAPN (20.6% vs. 79.4%) with minimum 6 month follow up. Table 1 summarizes demographics between the SP and MP cohorts and confirms no diffe rences except for more females in the SP group. Table 2 summarizes the intermediate outcomes at 6 month follow up. There was no difference in disease recurrence or hernia incidence. There were significant differences in preservation of GFR (10.5, p = 0.004 ) despite similar changes in creatinine in the SP group. Conclusion: Based on our analyses, SP partial nephrectomy is an effective treatment with similar recurrence rates and hernia incidence at 6 months post surgery compared to MP . We did note an improv ement in post op 6 month GFR for the SP group. The clinical significance of this is unclear as the change in creatinine was no different between the SP and MP groups.

The objective of this study will be to compare the outcomes of patients with COVID -19 who were treated with tocilizumab or baricitinib in addition to systemic corticosteroids. Methods: This will be a single -center, retrospective chart review of adult patients with COVI D- 19 who received systemic corticosteroids and received either tocilizumab or baricitinib between January 2021 and October 2022. Patients will be excluded if they never received corticosteroids, were under 18 years of age, or received both baricitinib and tocilizumab. Data collection will include patient demographics, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, COVID -19 vaccination status, and the dominant SARS -CoV -2 variant circulating at the time of admission. The primary outcome will be the percentage of patients with clinical improvement at day 14 after immunomodulator administration. Clinical improvement will be defined as two points improvement on a six -point ordinal scale or discharge from hospital. Secondary outcomes will include in -hospital mortality, clinica l improvement at days 7 and 28, incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during hospitalization, and duration of hospitalization. Results: Data collection is still ongoing, and statistical analysis is still pending. Data has been collected on 228 patient s to-date, and the final results will include roughly 350 patients. Out of the 228 patients collected, 86 received baricitinib and 142 received tocilizumab. The primary outcome of clinical improvement at day 14 was reached in 33 patients (38.4%) in the bar icitinib arm and 49 patients (34.5%) in the tocilizumab arm. Clinical improvement at day 7 occurred in 15 patients (17.4%) in the baricitinib arm and 17 patients (12.0%) in the tocilizumab arm. Clinical improvement at day 28 occurred in 47 patients (54.7%) in the baricitinib arm and 64 patients (45.1%) in the tocilizumab arm. Death during hospitalization occurred in 33 patients (38.4%) in the baricitinib arm and 66 patients (46.5%) in the tocilizumab arm. VTE during hospitalization occurred in 22 patients ( 25.6%) in the baricitinib arm and 31 patients (21.8%) in the tocilizumab arm. The average duration of hospitalization was 19.1 days in the baricitinib arm and 22.3 days in the tocilizumab arm. Conclusion: Patients treated with baricitinib for severe COVI D-19 appear more likely to have clinical improvement at days 7, 14, and 28. Baricitinib -treated patients also appeared to have shorter durations of hospitalization and lower in -hospital mortality than patients treated with tocilizumab. However, patients tr eated with baricitinib also appeared more likely to experience in-hospital VTE than patients treated with tocilizumab. Statistical analysis of these results is still pending.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a novel p harmacist -driven bowel regimen protocol in critically ill patients with the goal of preventing constipation and its related complications. Methods: A pharmacist -driven bowel regimen protocol was approved by the pharmacy and therapeutics (P&T) committee w ith the goal of improving bowel regimen prescribing practices for critically ill patients. A retrospective chart review was conducted two months prior to implementation of the protocol to establish baseline practices and six months after to assess its feasibility. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients admitted to the ICU on a continuous opioid infusion for at least 24 hours and major exclusions were hospice or comfort care patients, patients with an active gastrointestinal bleed, presence of diarrhea wit hin the past 24 hours and those admitted for abdominal surgery or showing evidence of bowel obstruction/perforation. The primary outcome used to assess feasibility was whether the patient had a bowel movement within 72 hours from the start of the opioid in fusion. Safety outcomes included incidence of diarrhea and ileus. Results: A total of 56 patients were included, with 28 patients in each group. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the results. The average fentanyl equivalent daily requirement was less in the pre -protocol group at 2020 mcg/day and 2539 mcg/day in the post -protocol group. The number of patients who had a bowel movement within 72 hours was 6 patients [21%] in the pre-protocol group and 5 patients [18%] in the post -protocol group. In the pre -protocol group there were 6 patients (21%) never started on a bowel regimen compared to 0 patients (0%) in post-protocol group. For safety outcomes there were 15 patients (54%) who experienced diarrhea in the pre -protocol group and 9 patients (32%) in the post -protocol group and no incidence of ileus in either group. Conclusion: The implementation of a P&T approved pharmacist -driven bowel regimen protocol seems to be a feasible option to prevent constipation and its related complications in critica lly ill patients. Clinical pharmacists were able to identify 28 patients in need of a bowel regimen. No major adverse outcomes were observed in the pharmacist -driven bowel regimen protocol group. This study is limited by the small sample size but shows a f easible option to implement at other institutions that may have inconsistent prescribing practices of bowel regimens in critically ill patients.

Patients with ACOS carry a higher mortality rate. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is a breath test t hat measures nitric oxide levels and endogenous gaseous molecules. It highlights steroid responders; predictability is more consistent than the typical tests. The purpose of this study was to determine if FeNO levels can lead to a change (addition, discont inuing, or change) in the pharmacologic management of patients with asthma, COPD, and ACOS. For the purposes of this study, our management focused on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), Inhaled corticosteroids - long- acting beta -agonists (ICS -LABA), anticholine rgics (AC) monotherapy, or combination therapy. Methods: We included 93 patients and following metrics were recorded. Medications, FeNO levels, along with their pre and post diagnoses, patients on mono/combination therapy were noted. The number of patient s without medication(s) of interest, their collective mean and range of FeNO (ppb) levels, number of patients whose therapeutic management changed based on FeNO (ppb) levels. Results: A total of 93 patients were included in this study. Before FeNO testing , 8, 13, and 8 patients were prescribed ICS, ICS -LABA, and AC, respectively. The mean FeNO (ppb) level in patients on ICS, ICS -LABA, and AC were 62.2 (ppb), 39.5 (ppb), and 24.5 (ppb), respectively. In addition to monotherapy, combination therapy usage was noted along with relative FeNO levels (ppb). Our analysis revealed that 42 patients were not on mono or combination therapy, and their mean FeNO levels were recorded as 19.7 (ppb). After FeNO testing, 16 patients were prescribed ICS, 22 patients prescribe d ICS -LABA, and five on AC, respectively. The mean FeNO (ppb) levels in patients on ICS, ICS -LABA, and AC were 44.3 (ppb), 23.4 (ppb), and 10.8 (ppb), respectively. There were a total of 42 patients who had not been prescribed any medications prior to the FeNO test; however, 24 of the 42 patients were prescribed medication(s) after the testing, and 18 were not prescribed any medication after the FeNO test. It is important to note that 24 patients were prescribed medication, six were prescribed ICS, and 11 w ere added to the combination regimen. Patients whose post FeNO management included change of pharmacologic agent to ICS (n=14) were diagnosed with with a change in management following the FeNO test (no ICS no ICS -LABA to ICS or ICS -LABA) carried the diagnosis of asthma only (n=5, mean FeNO 21.8 ppb), g is an affordable tool which assists in tailoring mediation regimen and in some cases eliminating the need of unnecessary medications.

However, a fixed dose of 10 mg diltiazem IV is commonly given in the emergency department (ED). The p rimary aim of this study is to compare the therapeutic response between patients who presented with AF with rapid ventricular response (RVR) and received either weight -based or fixed dose diltiazem in the ED. This is a retrospective, single - center chart re view study that included patients who presented with AF with RVR and received intravenous diltiazem in the ED between Jun 1, 2021, and Jul 31, 2022. Eligible patients were 18 years and older who received intravenous diltiazem in the ED. Patients were exclu ded if they received other rate control medications other than diltiazem, presented in acute decompensated heart failure, received cardioversion, or did not receive IV diltiazem bolus dose. The primary outcome is a composite therapeutic response heart rate < 100 beats per minute (bpm), and reduction in heart rate of 20% or greater. Secondary outcome measures include adverse events (hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and respiratory failure), time to hospital discharge, death during admission and A.fi b readmission. 204 patients who presented to the ED with A.fib with RVR from Jun 2021 to Jul 2022 were reviewed for inclusion, of which 62 patients were excluded. 56 patients received diltiazem weight -based dose vs 86 patients received diltiazem fixed dose . Baseline characteristics were comparable between treatment groups, except for initial diltiazem bolus dose. In the weight -based group, 54 patients (96%) received IV diltiazem bolus dose from > 10 mg to 30 mg compared to 68 patients (79%) received 10 mg I V diltiazem bolus dose in the fixed dose group. 10 patients in the weight -based group were redosed within 1 hour compared to 17 patients in the fixed dose group (p value: 0.81). The study population had a mean age of 72.6 years, 44% identified as women, an d the mean body mass index was 29.2, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. For the primary outcomes, heart rate <100 bpm and heart rate reduction 20% within 4 hrs occurred in 38 and 49, respectively in the weight -based gr oup compared to 58 and 74 in the fixed group (p value: 0.98 and 0.15, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference in the adverse events, time to hospital discharge, death during admission, and readmission rate between the two groups. Among patients who presented to the ED with A.fib with RVR, treatment with weight based IV diltiazem bolus compared to fixed dose did not result in a difference in composite therapeutic response or in secondary outcomes. Abstract # 44 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 44 A PILOT STUDY IN RECRUITING AND MATCHING UNDERREPRESENTED IN MEDICINE APPLICANTS TO A UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL OBGYN RESIDENCY PROGRAM Juanita Foncham MD MPH MBA [1], Anna Weinstein DO MS [1], Antonia Francis MD MSCI [1], Shelley Saber MD [1] Hackensack University Medical Cen ter Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology [1] Purpose: To identify trends in how underrepresented in medicine (URiM) applicants evaluate for compatibility with potential residency programs. Background: Racial disparities pertaining to pregnancy related morbidity and mortality have been well documented. The gap in these disparities is reduced with patient -provider racial and ethnic concordance. Increasing the pipeline of URiM medical trainees into residency programs is a means to help mitigate the larger existing healthcare disparities. Methods: Our institution hosted a webinar for URiM applicants featuring our URiM faculty and residents. A post -webinar survey was administered after the rank submission deadline, asking to self-report the extent to which various factors influenced the applicants' ranking of programs. Results: Fourteen URiM applicants attended the webinar. Most strongly desired their future OBGYN residency to have more than one identifiable URiM faculty mentor and more than one identifiab le URiM coresident (58.3%, n=7). While the majority of survey respondents reported having URiM mentors in medical school (66.7%, n=8), few reported feeling supported as URiM students at their home institution (16.7%, n=2). Of the attendees who also intervi ewed at our program, the majority reported that the webinar impacted their ranking of our program (66.7%, n=4). Conclusion: A paucity of respondents felt supported as URiM students, which may have contributed to a majority of respondents actively seeking programs with both coresident and faculty URiM representation. While attendance at our webinar was limited, the preliminary data indicates the URiM webinar had a positive impact on rank choice. Other institutions may consider implementation of similar init iatives to increase the national URiM resident physician workforce. Abstract # 45 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 45 DID THE INITIATION OF ACOG SURGICAL CURRICULUM IMPACT ACCURACY OF VIDEOS PUBLISHED ON YOUTUBE FOR OB/GYN RESIDENT EDUCATION? Juanita Foncham, Francis MD, MSCI [1] [1] Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ [2] Rutgers Health -Jersey City Medical Center, Jersey City, NJ [3] Atlantic Health System -Overlook Medical Center, Summit, NJ Background: The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of open access online OB/GYN procedural videos to the ACOG surgical curriculum (SCOG) and its educational value. YouTube is commonly used as an easily accessible resource for education and surgical preparation. There is no current research that evaluates instructional videos for educational usefulness across multiple obstetric and gynecologic procedures. Given the rigorous workload of residents and the fact that they are already relying on t hese videos, despite the lack of known quality control, this study was designed to develop an efficient way to determine whether any given video can deliver quality information that is useful for building surgical skills. Methods: SCOG topics were entered into YouTube search queries. The resulting videos were screened with strict exclusion criteria. The percent accuracy of each video was calculated as compared to the SCOG checklist for the corresponding procedure. Results: 306 videos were analyzed and cat egorized into 6 groups: private practice/independent physicians (n=127), academic institutions (n=70), commercial companies (n=50), non -academic institutions (n=32), international healthcare organizations (n=20), and other (n=7). Using the SCOG checklist, videos produced by international organizations had the highest percent accuracy at 50.6% followed by academic institutions at 45.8%. Conclusions/Implications: Using the SCOG checklist there is a significant variance in the accuracy of educational videos d epending on the associated publishing organization. OB/GYN residents should be mindful of publishing organizations on YouTube videos to ensure they are learning from accurate content in line with SCOG.

Background: Thoracentesis is a diagnostic and /or therapeutic procedure performed by aspiration of fluid from the pleural space. The procedure is performed by one of four methods: gravity drainage, manual sy ringe aspiration, continuous suction from a vacuum bottle, and continuous suction through a wall system. This literature review aims to investigate the safety of these techniques and to determine if there is a significant difference in the complication rat es between them. Methods: A comprehensive literature search revealed six articles studying thoracentesis techniques and their complication rates, reviewing a total of 20815 thoracenteses. Of all the procedures, 80 (0.4%) were performed by gravity drainage , 9431 (45.3%) by manual aspiration, 3498 (16.8%) by vacuum, 7580 (36.4%) by wall suction and 226 (1.1%) were unspecified. Results: Overall, there was a 4.4% complication rate including hemothoraces, pneumothoraces, reexpansion pulmonary edema (REPE), che st discomfort, bleeding at the site, pain, and vasovagal episodes. The rate of pneumothoraces and REPE alone was 2.5%. Sub -analyzed by each thoracentesis method, there was a 47.5% (38/80) complication rate in the gravity group, 1.2% (115/9431) complication rate in the manual aspiration group including 0.7% pneumothorax or REPE, 8% (285/3498) pneumothorax or REPE, 4% (309/7580) in the wall suction group all of which were either pneumothoraces or REPE, and 73% (166/226) in t he unspecified group most of which included vasovagal episodes. Procedure duration was shorter in the suction groups compared to gravity drainage. Two smaller studies indicated that in the vacuum suction groups, the rates of pneumothoraces, hemothoraces, R EPE causing respiratory failure, procedure site pain and early termination of the procedure were significantly higher than non vacuum techniques. However, other studies have noted that these complications may be due to other factors such as procedure durat ion, quantity of fluid removed, number of needle passes through, patients' BMI, and operator technique. Larger studies have demonstrated that symptom -limited suction drainage of pleural fluid using vacuum or wall suction is safe with a low risk of complica tions even in those with large volumes drained. Overall, emphasis on operator experience and the use of ultrasound have had a positive impact in reducing the rates of complications. Conclusion: The overall rate of significant complications from thoracente sis by any technique is low. All suction modalities of drainage seem to be safe and operator technique, attention to symptom development, amount of fluid removed, and intrapleural pressure changes may be important in predicting complication development, an d therefore, may be useful in choosing which technique to employ. Further randomized trials are needed to study how the specific modes of drainage during thoracentesis affect the development of these complications.

METHODS: We utilized an IRB -approved renal mass data base including 1017 patients who underwent partial or radical nephrectomy at our institution between May 2017 and April 2022. We evaluated 1017 patients who identified as either \"Hispanic\" or \"Non -Hispanic Caucasian.\" Continuous data was analyzed using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Categorical data was analyzed using Chi -Squared and Fisher's Exact Tests where appropriate. RESULTS: 134 patients (13.18%) self -identified as Hispanic and 883 (86.82%) identified as Non-Hispanic Caucasian (Table 1). In terms of pr esentation, Hispanic patients were significantly younger on average (56.95 vs 63.92, p=0.0000), more likely to be female (48.51% vs 33.64%, p=0.0001), and less likely to have a history of tobacco use (29.10% vs 43.57%, p=0.018). Hispanic patients had lower incidences of coronary vascular disease (1.491% vs 6.0%, p=0.0315) and chronic kidney disease prior to undergoing surgery (16.39% vs 24.47%, p=0.0158). There was no significant difference in rates of undergoing radical nephrectomy between the two groups (29.66% vs 24.5%, p=0.6212). There was no significant difference in from preoperative eGFR ( -11.99 vs -13.31 mL/min/1.73 m2, p=0.6012). Additionally, there was no significant difference in the rate of major complications (1.63% vs 2.29%, p= 1.0), 2.27%, p=1.000). CONCLUSIONS: In our Northern New Jersey population, we found that Hispanic patients presented with renal masses at younger ages with less comorbidities and less prior t obacco use in comparison to Non -Hispanic Caucasian patients. We did not identify significant differences in surgical management, perioperative or long -term outcomes between these cohorts. Our findings suggest that high volume, quaternary medical centers ma y reduce inequalities in access to care for patients from ethnic minorities. Abstract # 48 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 48 A POST -RESUSCITATIVE CARE PROTOCOL IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED DETECTION OF COMPLICATIONS IN THE WELL BABY NURSERY Andy J. Reyes Santos Center, Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital, Hackensack Meridian Health Network, Hackensack, NJ 07601; [2]Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, Nutley, NJ Resuscitation Program (NRP) recommends that neonates who required resuscitation in the delivery room via positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and/or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) should re ceive post -resuscitation care (PRC). However, there are no details to clarify what that should consist of. Previously at our institution, PRC was performed for newborns that continued to show signs of mild distress after resuscitation, and entailed informa l cardiorespiratory and blood glucose monitoring. After the new NRP's PRC guidelines, additional surveillance was established at our institution for infants who received PPV and/or CPAP in the delivery room, entailing cardiorespiratory monitoring in the nu rsery for three hours and admission blood pressure and blood glucose. Objective: To determine if a PRC protocol would result in more frequent NICU admissions and/or more timely identification of complications requiring NICU care. Methods: This was a singl e center retrospective and prospective cohort study from 2015 -2018. During this time, there were 25,122 live births with 21,884 nursery admissions. There were 367 infants in 2015 -2016 retrospective cohort and 398 infants in 2017 -2018 prospective cohort. Th e primary outcomes were incidence of NICU transfer and time to NICU transfer. Details of pregnancy, labor & delivery course, neonatal characteristics, and NICU course were collected. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), Welch's test, and Fisher's exact test of in dependence were used to compare continuous parametric, continuous non parametric and count variables, respectively. A Poisson regression model was used to compare the rate of transfer to the NICU. Results: Overall, baseline characteristics for neonates an d mothers were similar between cohorts. The incidence of NICU transfer was significantly higher in the PRC cohort (16.08% vs 11.17%, p<0.05). Infants monitored with the PRC protocol were 1.52 times (95% CI 1 -2.33, p=0.048) more likely to be transferred to NICU. The time to transfer for both groups (3:52 vs 4:24 hr:min, pre PRC vs PRC) was not different between groups. Likewise, a poisson regression model did not detect a significant difference in rate of transfer between both groups. Conclusion: Even when infants seemingly recover after delivery room resuscitation, there is a significant risk for complications, particularly respiratory distress in neonates who underwent resuscitation with PPV and/or CPAP. The time to transfer being similar between groups understandably corresponded to the maximum allotted time (4 hours) for nursery monitoring of respiratory distress. This cohort study demonstrates that a specific PRC protocol is feasible and may improve detection of late emerging complications requiring tran sfer to a higher level of care with over 85% compliance with the protocol. This supports NRP recommendations for increased surveillance after delivery room resuscitation with either resuscitative intervention. Abstract # 49 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 49 EVALUATION OF VALPROIC ACID USE FOR HYPERACTI VE DELIRIUM IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT H ackensack, New Jersey [2]Office of Research Administration, HMHN Research Institute, Hackensack, New Jersey [3]Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey Background: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) delirium is commonly encounte red in mechanically ventilated patients and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The current Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep Disruption in Adult Patients in the ICU (PADIS guidelines) recommend antipsychotic medications for patients experiencing significant distress or agitation that is harmful to themselves or others. However, antipsychotic medications may be associated with serious adverse effect s, and have shown inconsistent clinical efficacy in landmark trials. Recently there has been growing interest in utilizing valproic acid in hyperactive delirium due to less cardiac and anticholinergic side effects. There are several retrospective cohort st udies that have evaluated the use of valproic acid in critically ill patients with hyperactive delirium. Most of these studies demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of delirium, agitation, and a reduction in sedative requirements. In contrast, a recent retrospective study found no significant difference in delirium and coma free days or agitation and coma free days with the addition of valproic acid to antipsychotics versus antipsychotics alone. This study aims to characterize the use of valproic acid i n ICU patients with hyperactive delirium. Methods: This is an IRB -approved, retrospective, non -interventional chart review that includes adult patients 18 years of age, admitted to the MICU/CCU/4PW, received 24 hours of valproic acid between June 1 2021 through July 27 2022, and/or any antipsychotic exp osure 24 hours between January 1 2020 through June 31 2022 for the treatment of ICU hyperactive delirium. Only the first courses will be evaluated and interruptions <48 hours will be included. Patients were excluded if they were prescribed valproic acid a nd/or antipsychotics for indications other than ICU agitation or delirium, valproic acid or antipsychotics were home medications prior to admission, and concurrent carbapenem use with valproic acid. The primary outcome is the time to hyperactive delirium r esolution, and secondary outcomes is ICU and hospital length of stay, delirium duration, time to agitation resolution, time to delirium resolution, in -hospital mortality, restraint use, and use of adjunctive psychoactive medications. Results: Data collect ion is still on -going. The results of this study are pending. 48 patients are included in this study, with 34 patients in the antipsychotic monotherapy group, 9 patients in the valproic acid monotherapy group, and 5 patients in the combination therapy grou p. Statistical analysis is pending. Conclusion: The conclusion of this study is pending. Abstract # 50 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 50 UTILIZING ANTENATAL DOPPLER VELOCIMETRY AS A TOOL FOR PREDICTING OUTCOMES IN SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE NEWBORN Anna Weinstein, DO [1]; Kim Murphy, DO [1]; Tara Loz MD [1]; Marwa Khalil, MD [2] [1]: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology; Hackensack University Medical Center [2]: Department of Neonatology; Hackensack University Medical Center [3]: Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine Background: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity. The underlying etiologies of FGR are similar in that they cause uteroplacental hypoperfusion, which leads to chronic fetal hypoxia, negatively affecting fetal development and postnatal sequelae. Antenatal ultrasound surveillance with doppler velocimetry allows perinatologists to monitor the progression of FGR. While abnormal umbilical artery doppler stu dies have been implicated in poor neonatal outcomes, their utility in predicting specific neonatal morbidity has not yet been investigated. Our objective was to identify antenatal sonographic findings amongst FGR fetuses that can predict in the small -for-gestational -age A retrospective chart review of SGA neonates was performed. Corresponding maternal antenatal sonograms were reviewed. Pregnancies affected by known chromosomal abnormality were excluded. Grou p comparisons were performed using student t -test for continuous variables and chi -square test for categorical variables with a significance threshold of 0.05. Results: Eighty four SGA neonates were diagnosed with FGR antenatally. Maternal chart review identified a heterogeneous racial distribution. 26% of mothers were of advanced maternal age. 86% were at least overweight, and 40% met criteria for obesity. 30% of SGA neonates required total parenteral nutrition (TPN) postnatally (n=26), 50% of whom had ab normal umbilical artery dopplers on antenatal ultrasound (n=13; p <0.05). 13% of the neonates were noted to have residual feeds (n=6), 83% of whom had abnormal umbilical artery dopplers umbilical artery dopplers (n=15; p<0.05). After adjusting for gestational age, the average length of stay for SGA neonates who had abnormal umbilical artery dopplers was 19.5, whereas the average length of stay for SGA neonates without doppler abnormalities was 4 days (p<0.05). Conclusion: The preliminary results of this study demonstrate that FGR with abnormal umbilical artery dopplers is predictive of neonatal feeding intolerance, hyperbilirubinemia, and increased length of hospital admission. While a limitation of this study is small sample size, future investigative efforts are warranted to determine the reliability of our results in a higher powered database. Such research could inspire the development of antenatal sonographic markers for postnatal complications, optimizing informed care and prenatal counseling of pregnancies affected by FGR.

A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE Osman K. Yousafzai, MD[1]; Hirva Vyas, HUMC [2] Department of Internal Medicine, HUMC [3] Department of Internal Medicine, HUMC [4] Department of Cardiology, University of Louisville [5] Department of Cardiology, University of Arizona [6] Associate Librarian, Medical Library, HUMC [7] Department of Pulm onary Hypertension and Heart Failure, HUMC Background: Cancer and heart diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in developed nations. Due to donor shortages and poor transplant candidacy, left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) have beco me a preferred treatment modality in patients with advanced systolic heart failure. Cancer affects 1/10 patients approximately and shares common risk factors with cardiovascular diseases. It is therefore not surprising that a subset of LVAD patients will d evelop thoracic or breast cancers that require chest or mediastinal radiation. The aim of this review is to elucidate the safety of chest radiation in patients with LVAD. Methods: A systematic literature search from January 1 st , 2000, through June 2 nd , 2022 was conducted in the PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) was searched for Heart - Assist Device, Radiotherapy, and Radiation. Results: 71 records out of which 56 were exclude d which included LVAD patients who did not receive radiotherapy. 15 studies described the effect of radiation exposure on LVAD function. In all reports, radiation exposure did not result in pump stops, alarms, operational changes, or other device malfuncti ons. Conclusions: While further extensive studies are required for assessment of device specific dose tolerance and therapeutic validation, radiation therapy may be safe for LVAD patients without evidence of device malfunction when delivered carefully wit h conformal techniques.

Therefore, we sought to determine the 30 -Day readmission rate (30 -DRr) for IDA in individuals with CKD III/IV and its impact on healthcare utilization and economic burden i n the United States. Methods: Using the 2018 National Readmission Database and International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD -10) codes, a retrospective study of patient discharges with IDA as a primary diagnosis and with co -existing CKD sta ge III/IV as a secondary diagnosis. Readmission was defined as the first admission to any hospital for any non -trauma diagnosis within 30 days of the index, for patients discharged alive. The primary outcome was 30 -DRr, while secondary outcomes were readmi ssion mortality rate, length of stay, most common diagnoses for readmission, and resource utilization defined by hospital charge (HC). Results: A total of 10,884 index hospitalizations for IDA with co -existing CKD III/IV were identified. The mean age on index admission was 78.2 \u00b1 9.9 years, 61.7% (6,715) were female, and the in -hospital mortality rate was 0.5% (n = 54). The 30 -DRr was 14.7% (n = 1,590) (Figure 1). The mean age for readmission was 73.8 \u00b1 13.1 years, 54% (859) of patients were female, and the in -hospital mortality rate was 4.7% (n = 75) (95% CI 6.5 - 18.2, p < 0.001), which was significant compared to index admission mortality rate of 0.5% (n = 54). The average length of stay on the initial admission was 4.0 days, compared to 5.9 days on 30 -DRr (95% CI 1.4 -1.6, p < 0.001). Hospital charges on index admission had a mean of $36,236, compared to $60,071 on 30 - DRr (95% CI 1.4 -1.9, p < 0.001). Based on the data analyzed, there were statistically significant differences between the index admission and the 30 -DRr for mortality, length of stay, and hospital charges. The most common diagnoses on readmission were unspecified gastrointestinal hemorrhage 22%, brillation 1.5%. Conclusion: Patients with CKD stage III or IV are at higher risk for readmission and apart from end-stage renal disease patients, there exists little data on the factors associated with readmission for this group. Anemia in CKD patients h as been shown to prolong the length of stay in the hospital. We have demonstrated that the presence of iron deficiency anemia in a CKD III/IV patient is associated with an increased risk of readmission and a greater economic burden on the healthcare system . The implications of this data include the possible implementation of closer follow -up with nephrology post -discharge or more aggressive outpatient management of anemia.

The disease process itself, as well as the secondary symptoms impact opportunity cost in employmen t, physical ability and social independence. Chronic illnesses can often contribute to feelings of anger, anxiety, embarrassment, and fears of abandonment. Previous studies noted a positive relationship between socio -intellectual engagement on self - efficac y, stress perception and mood, as well as a negative relationship between socio - intellectual stimulation and poor mood and perceived stress. Adjustment studies also identified identity satisfaction and self -efficacy as protective factors for mood and sympt om management in patients with a recent diagnosis of MS. However, few studies have identified how the adjustment period after a recent diagnosis of MS can be affected by the level of social engagement. Accordingly, understanding the relationship between li festyle factors and disease adjustment may identify an increased role for psychiatric and social intervention in the comprehensive treatment of multiple sclerosis. Objective: To understand how the level of social engagement impacts adjustment to a recent d iagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Methods: Participants diagnosed with multiple sclerosis within a three month period underwent brief psychological screening with the PHQ -9 (patient health questionnaire -9 ) and GAD -7 (generalized anxiety disorder -7) to al low confounding mood as a consideration when analyzing data. Eligible participants proceeded to complete three standardized surveys assessed for resiliency (BRS), psychological adjustment (BASE -6) and social engagement. Results: A sample size of n=19 part icipants was included in the study with an age distribution of 21- 46 with female sex representing 72% of the sample size. Of the participants in the study 44% identified as Hispanic/Latin American and 33% identified as White/Caucasian. Approximately 26% o f participants had a psychiatric comorbidity. Approximately 42% of participants had scored moderate to severe in the PHQ -9 and 26% scored moderate to severe in the GAD -7. Based on preliminary review of data, there is no linear relationship between higher scores on the BASE -6 questionnaire and the social engagement questionnaire. Conclusion: Preliminary review of data suggests that there is no relationship between the level of general psychological adjustment and a participant's level of social engagement. However, further research following subjects longitudinally using the BASE -6 as a tool to track psychological adjustment can be done to further assess adjustment to a chronic diagnosis.

In the ED, he was tachycardic, tachypneic and febrile to 102F. There was tenderness of the right inner thigh and groin, pain with flexion of the hip, and a positive obturator sign. Initial evaluation was significant for leukocytosis with neutrophilia, elevated C -reactive protein, nucleocapsid IgG was positive. Chest radiograph demonstrated prominence of the pulmonary interstitium and mild patchy alveolar opacities at the l ung bases. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis revealed peripheral parenchymal nodules with trace left pleural effusion. The patient was started on ceftriaxone for possible bacterial community acquired pneumonia. After admission, the medi cal team had concern for a primary pyogenic focus with septic emboli. Repeat blood culture was sent, and the patient was started on IV vancomycin for possible Staphylococcus aureus infection. The CT was evaluated with pediatric radiology and there was concern for myositis. CT chest with contrast performed on hospital day three was suspicious for septic emboli. The repeat blood culture sent on hospital day two grew methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) sensitive to clindamycin. A Magnetic Re sonance Imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and right thigh then demonstrated pyomyositis with abscess. Subsequently, orthopedic surgery brought the patient to the operating room and appreciated purulence between the adductor longus and brevis and within the brevi s musculature. abscess cultures later grew MRSA. Post -operatively, the patient's antibiotic therapy was changed to clindamycin based on susceptibility with improvement in fever and pain. Pyomyositis is an infection of muscle that spreads hematogenousl y. Diagnosis can be difficult, and treatment is often delayed. For the patient in this case, the initial CT was not enough to make the diagnosis, and MRI was a crucial diagnostic step. The COVID -19 pandemic has added another layer of diagnostic murk. Amid st a flood of pneumonia with systemic inflammation caused by a ubiquitous novel respiratory virus, it is easy to lose sight of diagnostic landmarks that were once so familiar. A patient with multifocal pneumonia and elevated CRP would have been a red flag for invasive bacteremia. Now that patient is neatly rolled into our new reality of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus. A pandemic is a hard current to swim against. This case highlights the importance of not limiting focus to a single clinical feature and the importance of cooperation across multiple disciplines. An errant diagnosis can have all the inertia of a runaway freight train, and can be just as deadly. Abstract # 55 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 55 A \"COAL\" FINDING: A CASE [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Hackensack Meridian -Englewood health, Englewood, NJ Case Summary: A woman aged 70 -75 from Colombia pr esented with 3 weeks of worsening non-productive cough, shortness of breath, and hoarseness with 4 days of fever. On presentation, she was febrile and hypoxic to 88%. Examination revealed diffuse wheezing, rales, and bibasilar crackles. She had leukocytosi s, anemia, and hyponatremia. Blood cultures, streptococcal, and legionella antigens were all negative. Sputum culture was also negative for acid -fast bacilli. Chest x -ray showed right middle lobe consolidation and chest CT showed right middle lobe collapse . Initially, she was treated for acute exacerbation of asthma secondary to bacterial pneumonia with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, methylprednisolone, and bronchodilators, but symptoms black pig ments. Bronchoalveolar lavage bronchial negative for malignancy. Biopsy confirmed fibrosis and anthracosis of the right middle lobe without acute inflammation or malignancy. The patient was then diagnosed with diffuse pulmonary anthracofib rosis with middle lobe syndrome (MLS). Further history revealed that she had been exposed to a charcoal -burning stove for 16 years while in Colombia. Discussion Pulmonary anthracofibrosis (PAF) is characterized by hyperpigmented deposits on the tracheobron chial tree and lung parenchyma with associated narrowing and stenosis. The etiology is unknown; TB was thought to be causative, with 27 -60% of patients with PAF having TB. It has also been associated with biomass fuel exposure. Kim et al. proposed that chr onic smoke inhalation from incomplete combustion of biomass fuel leads to carbon particles being engulfed by macrophages, which remain in the respiratory submucosa and lead to chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Nearly half the world uses biomass fuel for h eating and cooking. As such, PAF is more common in women of developing countries who prepare meals in poorly ventilated spaces, with the median age of diagnosis being 67.9 years. Patients often present with chronic cough and dyspnea, are frequently diagnos ed with COPD and asthma and have a poor response to therapy. According to Kim et al., bronchial narrowing is most common in the right middle lobe (68%), leading to middle lobe collapse due to airway obliteration, as in our patient. The predilection for the right middle lobe may be due to a lack of collateral ventilation, sharp bronchial angle, and extrinsic compression by enlarged lymph nodes. Although no conventional treatment has been reported, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics have been u sed. Conclusion: Patients with PAF have nonspecific symptoms with undetected risk factors, leading to delayed diagnosis. Physicians must be able to conduct an extensive exposure history to help with diagnosis. PAF should be considered a differential diagn osis in female patients with chronic respiratory symptoms and radiologic evidence of MLS.

Patient developed five days of worsening extremity tone, pruritus and one day of visual and auditory hallucinations. Blood pressure 160/92, heart rate 115, satting 100% on room air. Creatine Phosphokinase 641 units/L. Abdominal X-ray unremarkable. Investigation into pump malfunction included a bolus dose without change in symptoms, and side port aspiration without flow indicating catheter malfunction. Withdrawal symptoms were treated using intravenous ativan and cyproheptadine. Patient was immediately taken to the operating room where the sheared catheter was replaced. The following two days, dosing of the withdrawal medications were maintained while titrating to her previous ITB dose. Her symptoms initially improved, but two day s postoperatively she experienced worsening hallucinations. Pump investigation and medical work -up into the causes of hallucinations were performed. Ultimately, the symptoms resolved once cyproheptadine was discontinued. Discussion: Cyproheptadine is a first generation antihistamine. Its antiserotonergic and anticholinergic properties prove beneficial in its off -label treatment of serotonin syndrome. It has been well demonstrated that intrathecal baclofen withdrawal mimics serotonin syndrome, given the surge of excitatory neurotransmitters occuring during withdrawal. Cyproheptadine is frequently used in the treatment of symptoms of intrathecal baclofen withdrawal, in addition to oral baclofen and intravenous benzodiazepines. Hallucina tion is an exceedingly rare side effect of cyproheptadine, often listed with a \"frequency not defined.\" Conclusions: This is the first documented case of cyproheptadine -induced hallucinations which mimicked the presenting ITB withdrawal symptoms. Patients should be closely monitored for the potential for worsening hallucination symptoms with the use of this medication.

While hospitalized, he developed new -onset right sided hemiballismus. Neurologic workup including MRI of the brain revealed a subacute ischemic stroke of the left basal ga nglia. The patient was initiated on Tetrabenazine, an inhibitor of the neurotransmitter transport protein VMAT2, and subsequently experienced improvement of hemiballismus. He was discharged to acute inpatient rehabilitation, where Tetrabenazine was initial ly unavailable. An alternative neuroleptic was initiated, but the patient experienced worsening of choreiform movements despite this. Upon obtaining and reinitiating tetrabenazine, the patient showed improvement and eventual resolution of hemiballismus. Af ter 20 days in inpatient rehabilitation, he was discharged home at a close supervision level. Through a hospital pharmacy discount program, the patient was given a provisional supply of Tetrabenazine, which can cost in excess of 4,000 USD for a 1 -month sup ply. Discussion: Tetrabenazine is a well -tolerated medication with a high efficacy in managing hyperkinetic movement disorders. However, its prohibitive cost can be a barrier to treatment for patients and providers. In this patient with basal ganglia stro ke, Tetrabenazine provided control of hemiballismus, allowing for participation in inpatient stroke rehabilitation and eventual discharge to home. Conclusions: This case highlights the prohibitive cost and difficulty of accessing Tetrabenazine, which may be critical for patients with movement disorders. Physicians should maintain awareness of patient assistance programs which can improve access to medications th at improve patient functional status and quality of life.

Family history was significant for coronary artery disease in his father. Physical examination and laboratory workup were consistent with acute congestive heart failure (CHF). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed dilated hypertrophic left ventricle diastolic dysfunction, ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45%, severe aortic regurgitation pressure of Transesophageal echocardiogram showed that immobile and the ao rtic root was dilated at 4.3 cm with no signs of vegetation or endocarditis. Patient underwent left heart catheterization which showed mild non obstructive coronary artery disease. After diuresis and medical optimization, the patient was discharged with ca rdiology follow up. The patient was readmitted for worsening symptoms. Repeat echocardiogram showed all heart chambers with moderate dilation and hypertrophy with severe diastolic dysfunction, LVEF 30% AR with immobile aortic valve, PASP at 57mm Hg. The patient was again aggressively diuresed and optimized for aortic valve replacement. Intraoperatively, a bifid right coronary cusp was found, consistent with a quadricuspid valve with flail rudimentary cusp at the level of the commissure, resulting in severe aortic insufficiency (AI). A prosthetic valve was placed and symptoms improved without complications. The patient's initial Metabolic Equivalent (METs) was 1.7 ml/kg/min and within 8 weeks improved to 8.7ml/kg/min; the patient was able to tolerat e 30 min of moderate intensity exercise without issues. Discussion: This patient presented with acute CHF and was found to have severe AR. Intraoperatively the right cusp was found to be bifid consistent with quadricuspid aortic valve. Congenital anomalie s of the aortic valve occur due commissural underdevelopment leading to the formation unicuspid, bicuspid or quadricuspid valve. Quadricuspid aortic valves (QAV) are extremely rare with an incidence of <0.05%. Its development is thought to be in part du e to a disruption in the division of one of the three mesenchymal ridges that would normally give rise to the three cusps. QAV can be asymptomatic in younger patients (< 18 years old) with symptoms developing later in life (> 40 years old). Symptoms depend mostly on the functional status of the valve. Echocardiography has allowed for earlier diagnosis. Indications for surgical management include severe AR and severe aortic stenosis. Aortic valve reconstruction surgery (AVRS) is the most commonly used method . Post procedural complications include progressive AR, cardiac arrest, third degree heart block and prosthetic heart valve endocarditis. This case highlights the rapid progression of heart failure due to a QAV with marked improvement in symptoms with surg ical treatment.

He received Bebtelovimab infusion and was discharged home in stable condition. Over t he next 24 hours he developed palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness prompting return to the ER where he was noted to be tachycardic (~150 bmp), hypotensive and hypoxic requiring BiPAP support. ECG revealed wide complex tachycardia (WCT). Laborat ory results were negative for any significant electrolyte imbalances, but brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponins were both elevated at 2200 pg/mL and 0.7 ng/mL respectively. His liver function was normal, but there was evidence of mild acute kidney injury with a creatinine level of 2.28 mg/dL. Of note, his previous cardiac catheterization revealed no critical coronary artery disease and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed ejection fraction (EF) of 45%. AICD past interrogations were negative for VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) episodes, but did reflect episodes of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and atrial fibrillation requiring automatic mode switching. He was compliant with his home medications of Apixaban and Sotalol and had no recent c hange in medications. In the ER, diltiazem and metoprolol were administered followed by diltiazem infusion for persistent tachycardia which abated shortly thereafter. Despite normalization of his heart rate, he became hypotensive with symptoms of acute hea rt failure for which milrinone was initiated. He then developed recurrence of WCT. Digoxin was given and amiodarone infusion was started however discontinued due to deterioration in both renal and liver function. AICD was interrogated reflecting that patie nt was in VT during both events. Under mild sedation, a shock of 20J was delivered restoring him to sinus rhythm. The AICD was reprogrammed to a lower detection rate and no further VT occurred. Follow up AICD interrogations revealed no further episodes of VT. Discussion: COVID -19 related arrhythmias have been widely reported and studied. It may occur due to direct viral myocardial injury, severe respiratory insufficiency, systemic inflammation reaction, or proarrhythmic effects of COVID therapies and othe r drug interactions as well as autonomic imbalance. Bebtelovimab, a spike protein monoclonal antibody, is authorized for emergent use for treatment of moderate to severe is COVID -19 infection. Side effects include allergic reactions and dizziness with one case report of bradycardia following Bebtelovimab infusion. Presently, there are no reported cases of Bebtelovimab potentially contributing to other arrhythmias such as VT storm, and the mechanism remains unknown.

Sebastian Casillas -Berumen, ; Yotsuya, MD [1] [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Raritan Bay Medical Center, Perth Amboy, NJ Learning Objectives: -Recognize risk factors based on the history obtained from the patient and correlate it with the presentation of symptoms, and based on this, understand which studies are relevant to initiate early management i n Group A Streptococcus pneumonia. -Appreciate the rarity of this medical condition in an otherwise healthy individual. Case Summary: This 32 year old male with no past medical history presented with fever, hemoptysis and tachycardia. Laboratory results s howed a white blood cell count of 21.4, sodium of 131, mild transaminitis and elevated creatine kinase. At this point pneumonia panel, Acid Fast Bacillus (AFB), and cultures for sputum and blood were sent. His initial imaging findings and clinical presenta tion were concerning for tuberculosis (TB) vs community acquired pneumonia (CAP), as it yielded a consolidation in the right upper lobe. The patient had no obvious risk factor except for imprisonment 2 years prior to his symptoms onset. Empirical therapy w ith ceftriaxone, azithromycin and methylprednisolone was started and infectious disease (ID) was consulted. Later on, quantiferon and 2 more AFBs were sent as per ID, that together with the rest of the studies, came out negative, except for sputum and bloo d cultures that were positive for Streptococcus pyogenes, ruling out TB. Antibiotic therapy was narrowed down to only Ceftriaxone, as per ID. Patient responded well to therapy, with subsequent resolution of hemoptysis, leukocytosis and lung imaging finding s, 2 weeks after he was discharged from the hospital. Discussion: The current body of knowledge regarding respiratory infections caused by Group A streptococcus (GAS) is limited by multiple factors, including its relative rarity and the diversity of how it can present, specially in a developed country. Its mimicry characteristics of other clinical entities, such as TB, can be deceiving, which can delay appropriate treatment if it occurs in settings where the diagnostic tools are not readily available. Thoug h it is associated with more severe outcomes than other types of pneumonia, the prevalence of modern antibiotics has helped limit the mortality. Though GAS pneumonia and TB share overcrowding as a common risk factor, a distant history of incarceration, as shown in this case, would not be relevant in GAS pneumonia since this entity occurs in an acute fashion, unlike TB. As a result, the history, imaging and constellation of symptoms, can be skewed, leading to an incorrect diagnosis. Conclusion: GAS is known to cause many different kinds of infections, including invasive pneumonia in rare cases, where there is usually a component of overcrowding. When it is the causative agent, it is associated with a more severe disease course, but it can often be adequately treated if caught early enough. By sharing more cases and atypical presentations of this disease, the clinical manifestations of this pathogen can be better understood, identified, and treated.

Case summary: A 61 year old male presented with a 9 day duration of neck pain, erythema and swelling for which he had previously been seen in the Emergency Department (ED). Initial comput ed tomography (CT) of the neck showed infiltration without collection and he was discharged on oral doxycycline. He presented again with worsening symptoms and new onset fever and chills. On examination, vital signs were within normal limits, and no signs of trauma. Swelling was noted at the neck in the region of the right sternocleidomastoid. Repeat CT scan of the neck showed an abscess measuring 2.5 cm in diameter (Image). Laboratory tests showed normal white blood cell count, glucose of 359, hemoglobin o f 8.5% and mild transaminitis. Patient was started on empiric antibiotics with vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam initially and then switched to targeted antibiotics with cefepime/vancomycin, once the blood cultures yielded Staphylococcus aureus. 4 day s after antibiotics course, most of his symptoms resolved except for neck tenderness and erythema involving the right sternoclavicular joint. Incision and drainage was done without complications, and tissue cultures confirmed S. aureus. Patient was dischar ged on a 6 week course of daptomycin. Discussion: Spontaneous intramuscular abscesses are a rare occurrence outside the tropical regions in individuals with no preceding trauma or other known risk factors such as poorly controlled diabetes. Therefore, they require a high index of suspicion to be diagnosed early and treated appropriately. This medical condition, also known as pyomyositis, has been previously documented in people with and without risk factors. However, the peculiarity of this case lies in thi s individual's immunocompetence, as he did not have a vulnerability that went beyond moderately controlled Diabetes. Different parameters for elevated A1c have been established over time that may proportionally correlate with an increase in the risk for in fection, but this has not been consolidated yet. The limited literature on this condition makes it difficult to determine the reason for its occurrence. Conclusion: Generally speaking, encountering cases of spontaneous abscesses is common in the context o f individuals with notable risk factors. Different muscle groups have been documented with this entity. The SCM, however, caught our attention as a peculiar location, particularly in this individual with no relevant risk factors or evidence of inoculation or trauma. By shedding more light on it, we hope to increase awareness and lead to an early diagnosis, therefore avoiding potentially fatal outcomes.

Labs demonstrated severe hyponatremia, which was ra pidly corrected with hypertonic saline from 104 to 122 mmol/L within 24 hours. Her mental status returned to baseline. Hyponatremia was further corrected to 134 mmol/L in the next six days but she subsequently became non -verbal with suspected mutism, and i nability to follow commands. MRI brain was compatible with osmotic demyelination syndrome. Patient received IVIG and plasmapheresis without immediate improvement. Upon acute rehabilitation admission, she was disoriented and apraxic, requiring maximum assis tance for ADLs and ambulation. After two weeks of comprehensive rehabilitation, she began to produce intelligible speech and inconsistent command following. Discussion: ODS was first described in chronic alcoholics with malnutrition, but was later expande d to patients who developed severe hyponatremia and were rapidly replenished. With a decrease in serum tonicity, water is displaced from the cells into CSF. Following rapid correction, the brain cannot recapture osmolytes, leading to parenchymal dehydratio n and demyelination of astrocytes The pons is particularly vulnerable due to its proximity to CSF via the fourth ventricle. Clinical symptoms of ODS commonly present with variations of motor dysfunction; however, our patient had predominantly behavioral sy mptoms. Similar findings were captured by Gopal et al., where after a week of sodium fluctuations and a one -time increase of 15 points, their 51 -year old female patient began demonstrating paranoid delusions and echolalia. Conclusion: Clinical symptoms of ODS vary greatly, extending beyond the typical presentation colloquialized as \"locked -in syndrome\". Particular emphasis must be made to not rapidly overcorrect sodium in patients with severe hyponatremia, with current guidelines sugge sting 6 -8 mEq/L per 24hrs. Our case demonstrated that multidisciplinary care is critical to improve medical and functional outcomes.

He requi red a right transfemoral amputation and right hemicraniectomy. In inpatient rehabilitation (IPR), the patient reported bilateral blurred vision that significantly impacted therapies. He required total assistance for transfers and wheelchair navigation, and needed both tactile and verbal cues for tasks. The patient was evaluated by a retina specialist and neuro -ophthalmologist for bilateral blurred vision. The exam was notable for visual acuity (VA) of counting fingers only and bilateral vitreous hemorrhages which precluded fundus examination to rule out optic nerve pathology. Finders were consistent with Terson's Syndrome (TS). Right -sided pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was during with plans for eventual left eye PPV. Post -PPV, right eye VA improv ed from only finger counting to 20/40 with intact visual fields. Consequently, tactile cues were no longer required in therapy and the patient became able to self -orient for tasks like upper - body dressing. Discussion/Conclusion: Estimated in only about 3. 1% of traumatic brain injuries (TBI), TS is defined as intraocular hemorrhage in the setting of intracranial bleed. Sequelae include macular holes, retinal detachment, and permanent blindness. Evaluation by ophthalmology with appropriate management is not only important for visual rehabilitation, but as seen in this case, can amplify general functional progress post -TBI. This patient's dual diagnosis of TBI and amputation made it particularly beneficial for him to have the PPV done before resuming IPR. Post-PPV, he demonstrated more active participation and progress in performing out -of-bed ADLs, enhanced self -correction for left -sided neglect, and independent use of modalities for right -sided phantom pain. Intervention for TS accelerated functional gains in IPR. Timely vitrectomy prior to or during IPR should be considered for patients with TS. This case demonstrates how early detection and management of TS facilitates functional improvement, allowing for new therapeutic goals during IPR.

Case Summary: Patient arrived at ED with primary complaints of vomiting, malaise, and l oss of balance. Diagnostics included CT head without contrast which demonstrated subacute L cerebellar infarction. MRI revealed acute L cerebellar infarction as well as old infarction of bilateral thalami. Clinically, the patient demonstrated symptoms of d ysmetria, poor coordination of LUE/LLE, leftward truncal lean, and vertiginous signs. The patient also displayed recurrence of bilateral lower extremity sensation deficits, worsening diplopia, and short -term memory loss, likely a recrudescence of her Arter y of Percheron stroke a few months prior. Subsequent TEE identified a PFO so the patient was initiated on anticoagulation and subsequently discharged to inpatient rehabilitation. Diplopia ultimately improved with use of prism glasses, although cognition re mained a barrier, with relatively poor carry -over between therapeutic sessions. Discussion: First described in 1973, the Artery of Percheron (AoP) is an uncommon anatomical variant that, when infarcted, consists of 0.4 - 0.5% of ischemic strokes. It is c haracterized as a common trunk that directly branches off of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) to feed the bilateral thalami. This is often initially identified on imaging, where conventionally MRI evidence would show a V -shaped hyperintensity on the pia l surface of the paramedian thalami and midbrain. Symptoms associated with paramedian thalamic syndrome vary based on extension of the infarct caudally into the mesencephalon, but generally include vertical gaze palsy, diplopia, ataxia, amnesia and fluctua ting levels of consciousness. Conclusion: A keen appreciation of anatomical variants can help fully elucidate a differential diagnosis among strokes, particularly those with high clinical symptom overlap. Bilateral thalamic infarction can occur more readi ly in individuals that possess the AoP, with a constellation of diencephalic and mesencephalic symptoms that may be early indicators of its involvement.

[1], Iqbal Jafri M.D. D.O. [1], Lei M.D. [1] Johnson Rehabilitation Institute Case Diagnosis: A 79 -year-old male with left iliopsoas hematoma causing moto r and sensory deficits across the femoral nerve territory. Case Summary: A 79 -year old male was admitted for left lower extremity (LLE) dysfunction following transfemoral cardiac catheterization. Physical exam confirmed 0/5 strength with LLE hip flexion a nd knee extension and sensory loss across the femoral nerve distribution. Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen fibrillations, positive sharp waves, increased motor unit amplitude, and severely reduced recruitment in the left vastus lateralis and rectus femoris. The patient was diagnosed with severe left femoral neuropathy. He required minimum assistanc e with static balance and was unable to ambulate. Discussion: The development of iliopsoas hematoma following cardiac catheterization is rare, at 0.5%, although incidence of femoral nerve compression with an established hematoma can be as high as 70% due to inelastic iliacus fascia. Management includes conservative and surgical approaches, with the average length of time to recover strength to a 4/5 level varying between 2.3 months with surgery and 3.6 months with conservative management. EMG findings of fibrillation potentials, increased motor unit amplitude and decreased recruitment are indicative of a neuropathic process. Assessment/Results: CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast prior to discharge demonstrated less high attenuation, suggesting resolvin g hematoma. Upon discharge, the patient achieved independent static balance, was able to ambulate 50 feet with contact guard, and negotiate 12 stairs with minimum assistance. Conclusion: Although rare, femoral neuropathy due to retroperitoneal hematoma m ay occur in patients post cardiac catheterization. Compressive femoral neuropathy due to retroperitoneal hematoma should be considered if muscle weakness is observed. Early diagnosis and appropriate rehabilitation treatment plans are helpful for a function al prognosis, but surgical management should be considered if motor weakness does not improve.

Here, we present a case of a 54 year old man with a past medical history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient had been previously diagnosed with COVID -19 four weeks prior which he fully recovered from. The patient then presented to the emergency room with chest pain, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and dizziness. Electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in the inferior and anterolateral leads, with an elevated troponin. He was transferred to the catheterization lab urgently where no significant coronary stenosis was visualized. 2D echo rev ealed depressed left ventricular function, ejection fraction 20 -25%, with severe global hypokinesis and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. In the critical care unit, the patient required inotropic support with eventual transition to further circulatory supp ort. He underwent intra aortic balloon pump placement. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and biopsy was diagnostic for giant cell myocarditis. The patient was started on immunosuppressive therapy and high dose steroids. He was then discharged and referred to a cardiac transplant team. Despite the growing understanding of COVID -19 myocardial involvement, cases of COVID -19 myocarditis are likely under -reported(10). A study by Annie et.al showed the prevalence of clinically confirmed COVID -19 myocarditis acro ss a large multinational registry to be 0.01% (256 patients), with an associated increased mortality, underscoring the importance of diagnosing patients with myocarditis early in the process (9).

Understand the mechanisms of potential hepatotoxicity with amphetamine use. Discussion: A Caucasian female in her 20's with a history of narcolepsy, depression, anxiety, PTSD and ADHD, st able on Lexapro for over a month, admitted to hospital for nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain for two weeks, reported with initiation of Adderall. The patient denied an intentional overdose of medications, previous history tranquilizer and stimulant use. On exam, patient was jaundiced with scleral icterus, and was found to have acute hepatic failure with marked elevation in AST, ALT, total bilirubin, INR and PT. CT showed mild diffuse hepatic steatosis. Lexapro and Adderall were discontinued immediately, N -Acetylcysteine (NAC) was given in ED, lactulose initiated for prevention of hepatic encephalopathy. Extensive testing revealed no specific cause for injury. Acetaminophen and salicylate level, blood alcohol, acute hepatitis panel all within normal limits, ur ine drug screen positive for cannabis. Serologic testing negative for HIV, CMV, Hepatitis, A, B, C in addition to other markers. Imaging provided no clear origin for hepatic injury. The patient's hospital course was not significant for invasive interventio n, liver function stabilized through discontinuation of two standing medications, eventually discharged within a week for liver biopsy and outpatient treatment. Conclusion: Liver injury secondary to chemicals and toxins accounts for 30% of acute hepatic injury (Vanga et. al 2013). There are several potential mechanisms through which amphetamine and dextroamphetamine (D -AMPH), the components of Adderall, can cause liver injury. One such mechanism includes lack of cytochrome P450 oxidase CYP2D6, seen in 5 -9% of Caucasians, resulting in accumulation of hepatotoxic medicine. Another possible mechanism of injury is through microvesicular fatty change within hepatocytes. In addition to these processes, the patient's previous use of stimulants and tranquilizers ma y have predisposed to development of steatohepatitis. Despite these known mechanisms, Adderall -induced hepatic injury is not often observed in clinical practice and there are limited reported cases in literature. The patient's onset of symptoms coinciding with initiation of Adderall and subsequent medical stabilization following discontinuation, without a clear reason following extensive medical testing, suggests Adderall as the cause for her hepatic injury and deserves further exploration.

Ioulia Furman, MD [1]; Jamie M. Pinto, MD [1] [1] Department of Pediatrics, Jersey Shore Un iversity Medical Center, Neptune, NJ Learning Objectives: 1) To recall common presenting symptoms of carbon monoxide (CO) toxicity 2) To recognize atypical presentation 3) To review the pathogenesis of cutaneous findings in CO poisoning A 6 week old infa nt presented to the Emergency Room (ER) with a history of persistent perioral cyanosis and diaphoresis with feedings. There were no additional sick symptoms. Patient was full term with an unremarkable nursery course. Vital signs consisted of a heart rate, 138 beats per minute(/min), respiratory rate of 40/min and an oxygen saturation (O2 sat) of 100% on room air (RA). On initial assessment, the patient had cyanosis of the lips and purple/blue sucking blisters while the remainder of the physical exam was unr emarkable. Complete Blood Cell Count (CBC), Complete Metabolic Panel (CMP), Chest X -Ray and an electrocardiogram (ECG) were ordered and all within normal limits. Following admission, Arterial Blood Gases (ABGs) were obtained resulting in an elevated pH of 7.34 (7.35 -7.45) , partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2 ) of 39.8 mmHg (5 -45 mmHg), (50 MetHb at percent (ref. <1%) and COHb 2.8 percent (ref <1.5%). The patient was then placed on 100% O2 via a non - rebreather mask. Upon further assessment it was determined that the infant was exposed to CO during a buildin g fire. Discussion: CO toxicity is one of the most common causes of poisoning, accounting for 50,000 ER visits and 1,200 deaths annually. CO is a non -irritant gas that is odorless, colorless, and tasteless. However, when combined with hemoglobin in the blo od, it forms a cytotoxic COHb compound leading to tissue hypoxia. The most common CO exposures are house fires, gas leaks, motorbike exhaust, exposure hookah smoke and methylene - chloride/dichloromethane found in paint remover. Toxicity occurs within 20 day s of exposure and primarily affects the central nervous and cardiovascular system. However, initial CO symptoms such as fatigue and malaise are often non -specific. Infants are more likely to present with altered mental status. Symptoms are faster in onset and more severe in children due to a higher metabolic demand. Cutaneous manifestations of CO toxicity such as discoloration, lesions, erythema and induration are often mistaken for cyanosis like it was for this patient. Untreated CO toxicity can progress t o hypoxia, seizures, arrhythmias or what is known as delayed neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by personality changes, abnormal movements, cognitive and neurological deficits. It is essential for practitioners to broaden their differential diagnosis and assess toxic exposures such as CO when patients present with cyanosis in the setting of normal pulse oximetry. Early identification and management is essential to reduce mortality and morbidity.

He was evaluated by his cardiologist the day prior to admission and was found to be hypotensive with worsening kidney functio n, leading to the discontinuation of Benazepril. On arrival, a heart rate of 34 and blood pressure (BP) of 159/69. The physical exam was remarkable for bradycardia. Laboratory evaluation was significant for hypokalemia with potassium (k+) of 2.8 mmol/L, ma gnesium (Mg2+) of 1.5 mg/dL, Acute Kidney Injury on CKD, with creatinine (cr) of 2.01, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 44 (baseline cr 1.25 and BUN 20). No orthostatic drop in BP. EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with U waves and prolonged QT interval > 6 00 msec. Telemetry revealed two episodes of torsades de pointes; both initiated with sinus bradycardia, prolonged QT interval, premature ventricular contractions, and long short sequences likely due to hypokalemia induced by Venetoclax and polypharmacy. Ve netoclax was discontinued, and Ciprofloxacin and were for Cefepime and Isavuconazole, respectively. Amiodarone, Metoprolol, and Torsemide were discontinued indefinitely. K+ and Mg were aggressively replenished, with a progressive uptre nd of electrolytes noted after stopping Ventoclax. Subsequent EKG showed improvement of the QT interval alongside a resolution of U waves and subsequently reverted to sinus bradycardia. The patient was discharged home on Amoxicillin/Clavulanate and Isavuco nazole with close follow -up with a hematology -oncology and cardiology. Discussion/Conclusion: Venetoclax has the potential for renal toxicity via damaging the proximal and distal tubules of the kidneys, causing losses of potassium and magnesium. Only a few reported cases and studies have been published that show Venetoclax causing electrolyte imbalances like hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, but they were mainly found to be asymptomatic or attributed to antimicrobial prophylaxis medications or underlying can cer. We recommend cautious concomitant use of other medications like chemoprophylactic and antibiotic prophylactics, plus vulnerable groups like CKD and arrhythmias, which can potentially cause hypokalemia and QT prolongation. The use of Venetoclax in thes e patients would require closer monitoring of electrolytes and kidney function to avoid fatal adverse events. Our case presents such a situation where Venetoclax, in conjunction with other medications, could lead to an unfortunate and life -threatening even t. However, additional studies are required to find a direct association between Venetoclax and electrolyte abnormalities and establish its interaction with other drugs.

Remarkably, three weeks prior, while being worked up for abdominal wall cellulitis with blood cultures positive for Streptococcus gallolyticus, he was incidentally found to have infective endocarditis (IE) of the aortic and mitral valve. At that time, he was discharged with a Ceftriaxone infusion for six weeks. His vital signs showed tachypnea. On physical examination, jugular venous distension, bilateral basilar rales plus two pitting were noted, harsh systolic murmur in the second intercostal space (ICS) right parasternal radiating to the right carotid a rtery and blowing diastolic murmur in the left fifth ICS of the midaxillary line radiating to the axilla were heard, and 2x2cm soft, non -tender, immobile mass was appreciated in the right side of the neck. His brain natriuretic peptide was 1406 pg/ml. CT c hest revealed lower lobe pulmonary embolism and pulmonary edema. The echocardiogram demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 65 -70%, severe aortic regurgitation, and moderate size aortic and mitral valve vegetations, which were larg er compared to the previous study. CT soft tissue neck revealed findings highly concerning for osteomyelitis at C5/C6 and a prevertebral abscess, measuring approximately 7.7 x 2.6 x 5.0 cm in size. The patient was started on Furosemide, cultures were repea ted, and Ceftriaxone was continued. The patient was transferred to our main facility emergently for aortic and mitral valve replacement. After the cardiac surgery, he was managed in the intensive care unit and underwent a C5/C6 anterior corpectomy and C4 -C7 fusion. Colonoscopy was negative for colon cancer, demonstrating only two benign colon polyps. After guideline -directed medical therapy, he was discharged to follow -up outpatient. Discussion/Conclusion: It has been well -established the association of S treptococcus gallolyticus bacteremia with colorectal carcinoma. Multiple hypotheses have been elucidated, with the most common mechanism being ulceration of polyps leading to hematologic dissemination; however, it is not well established how this pathogen enters the bloodstream in patients without polyps. One accepted theory is its passage through biliary channels, as Streptococcus gallolyticus bacteremia has been identified in cases of acute cholangitis and hepatic abscesses. To our knowledge, no case of S treptococcus gallolyticus bacteremia due to abdominal wall cellulitis and only a few ones due to colonic adenoma resulting in IE have been reported in the literature. Through this case report, we highlight the atypical presentation of Streptococcus galloly ticus IE due to either abdominal wall cellulitis or benign adenomas to aid clinicians in its earlier recognition and treatment and contribute to the growing literature of the etiologies associated with this phenomenon.

No recent trauma or prior headache was reported. Initial exam was notable for right facial droop and right -sided weakness. CTA head found left supraclinoid internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 stenosis with near -occlu sion and increased number of Digital confirmed extensive collateralization of perforators for the lenticulostriate branches and left posterior cerebral artery. He was diagnosed with acute left MCA infarcti on secondary to Moyamoya Disease (MMD). Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) was initiated and he was subsequently transferred to inpatient rehabilitation. Therapy targeted right hemiplegia, and cognitive deficits with expressive and receptive aphasia. Discuss ion: MMD affects 0.5 -1.5 per 100,000 individuals in East Asian countries annually and even lower elsewhere. More females than males, in a 1.8:1 ratio, present with migraine -like headaches, transient ischemic attack, and ischemic stroke. This case describes an uncommon presentation of MMD in a male with nonspecific symptoms of dizziness and holocephalic headache. Proper imaging identified the classic \"puff of smoke\" collateral vessels, indicative of MMD as the cause of stroke. It is important to be aware of the variations in presentation and less common symptoms that patients with MMD could present with so as not to delay diagnosis and subsequent care. Other possible presentations of MMD include seizures, choreiform movements, ICH, and visual impairment. Patients may also be asymptomatic with incidental findings of MMD. Conclusion: MMD remains a disorder of unclear pathophysiology due to various factors including genetics, anatomical anomalies, epidemiology, and association with other risk factors. It is impo rtant to recognize the variations in presentation, including the uncommon symptomatology, of this less -than-common diagnosis so as not to delay treatment and subsequent stroke prevention.

She required intub ation and hospitalization. MRI brain and spine showed diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and entire spinal cord as well as long segmental myelitis of the spinal cord. Serology was Jamestown Canyon Virus (JCV) IgM equivocal and La Crosse Virus (LCV) IgM positive, confirmed with positive JCV and LCV plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). The patient required tracheostomy and PEG tube placement, and had return of function in bilateral upper extremities with continued lack of motor function in bilateral lower extremities. She was discharged to inpatient acute rehabilitation and progressed to minimal assistance for ADLs and independent for wheelchair mobility due to persistent lower extremity weakness. After tracheostomy decann ulation and PEG tube removal, she was discharged to subacute rehabilitation for ongoing care. Discussion: LCV and JCV are mosquito -borne California serogroup orthobunyaviruses and are exceedingly rare infections. LCV has an annual incidence rate of 0.004 per 100,000 adults. There are 10 -75 cases of JCV annually in the United States. Patients present with fever, malaise, neck stiffness and GI upset; hyponatremia and upper respiratory symptoms are seen in LCV and JCV infections, respectively. LCV is diagnose d with detection of elevated LCV IgM antibody in serum, while JCV diagnosis is made via positive JCV IgM in serum and/or CSF and confirmation by PRNT due to significant cross -reactivity among the California serogroup. No antiviral therapy or vaccine exists for LCV or JCV and management is supportive. There are no reported cases of meningoencephalitis with co -infection of LCV and JCV. Conclusions: This describes meningoencephalitis with co -infection of LCV and JCV, and highlights improvement despite pe rsistent weakness through supportive care and intensive inpatient rehabilitation.

She notably did not receive any prenatal care prior to admission. Imaging of the head revealed a right pontine intracerebral hemorrhage . A cardene drip was initiated for significantly elevated blood pressure. The patient was diagnosed with preeclampsia complicated by HELLP syndrome. An emergent cesarean section was performed. Multiple platelet transfusions along with a magnesium drip were also required. Hospital course was complicated by dysphagia requiring placement of a gastrostomy tube (G -tube). The patient subsequently went to acute inpatient rehabilitation (IPR) where therapies immediately addressed her severe hemiparesis and dysphagi a, optimizing her long -term functional outcomes. Case Diagnosis: Acute pontine hemorrhage secondary to Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, and Low Platelets (HELLP) syndrome Discussion: HELLP syndrome, a subtype of preeclampsia, occurs in about 0.5 -0.9% of pregnancies. The overall incidence of stroke during pregnancy is about 30 in 100,000. In addition to preeclampsia, our patient was high parity with advanced maternal age, presenting with an NIHSS of 10 and ICH of 1, thereby rendering her in the severe str oke category. Despite her medical complexity and functional deficit, the prompt IPR course with interdisciplinary coordination of care allowed her the maximum functional outcome and she was discharged home. Conclusion: Although the incidence of stroke dur ing pregnancy is relatively low, preeclampsia remains a significant risk factor for peripartum stroke. This patient did not receive adequate prenatal care, or follow -up during pregnancy, thus placing her at risk. This case describes the uncommon situation of preeclampsia with HELLP syndrome presenting initially as a severe stroke, highlighting the importance of immediate IPR to maximize functional recovery.

A review of systems was unremarkable and he was asymptomatic. He denied any use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. His vitals were BP 154/70 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, RR 14 breaths per minute, Tmax 98.6 , and SpO2 99% on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable. COVID -19 test came back positive. The patient was started on casirivimab/imdevimab infusion. He became f lushed, erythematous, and profusely diaphoretic a few minutes later. Due to high suspicion of a hypersensitive reaction, the medication was immediately discontinued. However, he suddenly became bradycardic, hypotensive, and progressed into cardiac arrest. Cardio -pulmonary resuscitation started immediately. -liter normal saline bolus were administered. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was achieved within five minutes. Post -ROSC el ectrocardiogram revealed accelerated junctional rhythm with no revealed revealed an ejection fraction (EF) of 65 -70% with no wall motion abnormalities. Computed tomography - angiogram of the chest revealed calcification of coronary arteries without any evidence of stenosis or occlusion and no pulmonary embolism. The patient recovered and was discharged in stable condition. On an outpa tient follow -up, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results revealed a normal left ventricular size with an EF of 80%. On late gadolinium enhancement imaging, myocardial fibrosis or myocardial infarction. Discussion: Casiriviamb/imdevimab was temporarily granted emergency use authorization for post-exposure prophylaxis in cases of severe COVID -19 infection. However, on January 24th, 2022, the FDA withdrew its authorization due to emerging data demonstrating a lack of efficacy against the omicr on variant, which was the leading COVID -19 subtype [2]. Since its launch, data regarding this monoclonal antibody cocktail infusion's efficacy and safety profile data has been increasingly described. Multiple clinical trials have reported a 1 -2% incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis [3]. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of casirivimab/imdevimab causing hypersensitivity -induced cardiac arrest as a potential adverse side effect. While the decision to revoke the therap ies emergency use authorization status originated from a lack of efficacy, the literature also suggests that the safety profile data is not as appealing as previously thought. Our case aims to contribute to the growing awareness of adverse events from casi rivimab/imdevimab and ultimately supports the FDA's decision to limit its usage due to life -threatening hypersensitivity reactions, which outweigh any potential benefit.

Greenwald MD [1] [1] Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Hackensack Meridian JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute, Edison, NJ Case Summary: Patient with history of CRPS presented with AMS and w as found to have a left parieto -occipital mass. Her course was complicated by status epilepticus refractory to lorazepam, levetiracetam, lacosamide, and valproic acid. Termination of seizures was achieved with a phenobarbital and phenytoin regimen. Patient underwent excision of the mass which revealed an abscess growing strep viridans requiring intravenous ceftriaxone. In acute inpatient rehabilitation, she developed a diffuse pruritic maculopapular rash. Phenytoin and phenobarbital levels were in therapeut ic ranges. Medication changes tried included discontinuation of pregabalin and switching ceftriaxone to vancomycin. Symptoms were managed with oral diphenhydramine, topical hydrocortisone, hydroxyzine, and oral steroids with no improvement. Phenytoin was h alved then discontinued and replaced with levetiracetam with substantial improvement in symptoms. Notably the rash began 22 days after initiation of phenytoin in the acute care hospital. Prior to discharge the phenobarbital was discontinued and the patient was able to continue only on Keppra. Discussion/Conclusion: New -onset generalized rash in the inpatient setting is commonly medication induced (cutaneous adverse drug reactions (cADRs)) and occurs closely timed with the start of inciting agent. The major ity of cADRs are neither severe or life -threatening. Symptom management and prompt discontinuation of the medication are important to minimize patient suffering. Isolating the cause can prove difficult as cutaneous reactions are common with many classes of medication including antibiotics, antiepileptics (AED), pain medications, chemotherapy, and psychotropic medications. Among AEDs, incidence of rashes range from 1.7 to 8.8%. Maculopapular rash from phenytoin usually occurs 3 to 20 days after initiation. A s with this patient, when multiple medications are potential triggers of rash it is prudent to exercise a tiered approach for alternatives by considering the harm -benefit ratio of each agent. This is a case of maculopapular rash management complicated by m ultiple medication risk factors. Physiatrists need to be familiar with the differential and management of cADRs.

She was found to have right frontal infarct on CT head. MRI brain confirmed acute right centrum semiovale infarction. She underwent stent placement due to failure on aspirin a nd plavix. Neurological exam revealed left sided weakness (arms > legs) with diminished fine motor control. She was admitted to ARI for 2 weeks and received PT, OT, and ST through video or in -person American Sign Language (ASL) translator. Despite decrease d motor function of left upper extremity, her signs were intelligible and appropriate, with intact comprehension. Additional challenges from her infarct included cognitive fatigue, impaired problem -solving, memory impairment, and impaired reading comprehen sion/written expression in both English and Spanish which was previously intact. The patient progressed in therapy and was discharged to home with outpatient care. DISCUSSION: There are about 500,000 deaf ASL users in the US. Words in ASL can be divided into three types: one -handed, two -handed symmetrical, and two -handed asymmetrical. Literature is sparse regarding stroke outcomes in this patient population, and primarily revolves around cerebral organization of language. While language is processed and g enerated through left temporal and frontal regions, ASL users were assumed to theoretically depend on bilateral hemispheres as their language encoding requires visual and spatial processing. However, several case studies have disproved this theory; demonst rating ASL users with right -sided strokes had preserved language use and ASL users with left -sided strokes had impaired signing and comprehension. Theoretically, signing words with two -handed asymmetrical ASL would be most impaired by hemiplegia. The patie nt's right -hand dominance allowed her to sign impaired but comprehensible language, however evident that certain words that required two hands remained asymmetrical. CONCLUSION: We describe the case of a deaf, CVA patient who utilized ASL for communication. For clinicians, recognizing the unique challenges that neurological deficits pose to deaf patients is crucial to forming an individual therapy plan to address communication deficits.

It was associated with mild epigastric pain but no changes in bowel habits, fever, chills, hematemesis, or melena. He had a similar episode three months ago where he required hospitalization. No ot her associated symptoms. Past medical history includes UC diagnosed 14 years ago, chronic deep vein thrombosis, hypertension, lower extremities lymphedema, and hypertension. Surgical history includes total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch -anal anastomosis two years ago. Family history was remarkable for a father who had coronary artery disease and a mother who had breast cancer. He was taking pantoprazole 40 mg tablet daily, amlodipine 5 mg tablet daily, and atorvastatin 20 mg tablet daily. He does not smok e or drink alcohol and denies any illicit drugs. He has no known allergies. On admission. Vitals were within normal. He is awake and alert. Conjunctiva was anicteric. He has good air entry with no wheezing or crackles on the lung exam. The abdomen was soft and mildly tender in the epigastric region. Bowel sound was normal. No perianal lesion was noted on rectal exam. Labs revealed 109/L, Hgb 1 mmol/l and serum gastr in level is 55 pg per ml. CT abdomen revealed the stomach was markedly distended with narrowing at the gastroduodenal junction which demonstrates mural thickening and evidence of mucosal ulceration, with surrounding edema. Small and large bowels are normal in caliber. There is a patent colorectal anastomosis. Upper endoscopy was performed this admission and 3 months ago which revealed severe acute and chronic esophagitis with an esophageal ulcer, deformed stenotic pylorus, H pylori negative gastritis, and s evere extensive duodenal ulcerations. He was treated with intravenous (IV) acid suppression therapy, IV hydration, and nasogastric decompression. The patient improved but he did require a period of IV parenteral nutrition. Given his persistent symptoms for months with no improvement, the decision was to precede with surgical treatment. He underwent a gastrojejunostomy to bypass the obstruction. The patient did well after surgery and tolerated the oral diet. UC is a chronic, relapsing disease with the colore ctum as the chief target organ of UC, whereas upper gastrointestinal (UGI) manifestations are infrequent. Recently, emerging evidence has suggested that UC presents complications in esophageal, stomach, and duodenal mucosal injuries. UGI involvement may be ignored by many clinicians. The occurrence of UGI lesions has been estimated in 5% -19% of patients. 5 - aminosalicylate, infliximab, corticosteroid, or antitumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been effective. A high index of suspicion is needed to recognize and treat these lesions effectively.

The patient had a past medic al history of fragile -x permutation, uncontrolled hypertension, and atrial fibrillation. The patient had no significant past psychiatric history. She has a son diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and fragile X syndrome. In clinic, she presented with a 6-month history of mood lability, pressured speech, forgetfulness, suspiciousness, and sleep disturbance. Medical work -up was significant for Head CT brain demonstrating a small remote area of encephalomalacia in the left frontal deep white matter. On cogn itive evaluation, she scored 30/30 on the MMSE and 29/30 on the MOCA. The patient was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, MRE manic with psychotic features. She was prescribed quetiapine 50 mg PO BID. Two weeks later, she returned with worsening symptoms of disinhibited behavior, irritability, increased non -goal-directed activity, aggression, disorganized thought process, word -finding difficulty, and inability to care for her son. She had not been adherent with quetiapine. One week later, she was admitted to a psychiatric unit for stabilization. After ten days of treatment and titration of Divalproex to 500 mg PO BID, her symptoms improved. DISCUSSION: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion of CGG in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1(FMR1) gene located on the X chromosome.[1] It is classified according to the number of CGG repeats with normal alleles (5 -44 repeats), alleles -200 repeats), or full mutation alleles (>200 repeats). Premutation expansions are common. They occur as 1 per 113 -259 females and 1 per 260-810 males. People with fragile -x gene permutations have a higher incidence of new -onset older -age mood disorders, including OABD.[1] We recommend routinely screening patients with fragile X premutation for late -life mood and anxiety disorders. However, in this case, we cannot exclude the possibility of vascular mania contributing to the patient's presentation due to the patient's underlying cerebrovascular d isease. [2,3]. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychiatric correlates of the fragile x permutation are under - researched, though in combination with cerebrovascular changes may increase susceptibility for OABD. Clinicians should be alerted to the increased risk of psych iatric disorders beginning in late-life in carriers of the 1 - neuroimaging and mood disorders: Recent findings, implications for classification, and future directions.

Hovnanian Children's Hospital, Hackensack Meridian Health Network, NJ [2] - Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, NJ [3] - Saint George's University School of Medicine Case Presentation: A previously healthy newborn presented with seizure -like activity and decreased intake. Two household contacts had recent upper respiratory tract infections. Vitals: Temperature 39.5C, heart rate 174, respiratory rate 38 and oxygen saturation 97% on 1 lit er of oxygen by nasal cannula. Physical exam was notable for irritability, hypotonia and recurrent self - limited apneas lasting 10 -15 seconds with oxygen desaturation to 82%. A complete infectious workup was done, including blood, urine and cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) cultures, complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel, and CSF PCR panel which were within normal limits except CSF PCR was positive for parechovirus (PeV). Patient was placed on antimicrobial s until all cultures were negative. He underwent EEG and MRI to consider seizures. EEG was normal but MRI demonstrated multifocal areas of restricted diffusion within the white matter of the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes and the splenium of corpus consistent with PeV meningoencephalitis with possible superimposed hypoxic ischemic injury. Further work -up included magnetic resonance chest X -ray, echocardiogram, and polysomnography X-ray were n ormal and echocardiogram showed left physiologic peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, an unlikely cause of apneic events. PSG showed central apneas with bradycardia and oxygen desaturations. Patient was managed with oxygen and recovered over ten days. He was discharged with an apnea monitor and close follow up with primary care, neurology, neonatal apnea and Early Intervention providers. Discussion: We describe a case in which a recent CDC advisory increased our suspicion for a rare cause of apnea and neu rologic symptoms in a young infant. PeV infection is difficult to diagnose as symptoms are nonspecific, often presenting as sepsis -like illness or similar to CNS Enteroviral meningitis in neonates. Although CSF studies in both cases often lack pleocytosis, CSF PCR is able to differentiate the two. CSF PCR panels don't routinely include PeV so index of suspicion needs to be high to search for it. Although limited data on neurodevelopmental sequelae of PeV meningoencephalitis exists, awareness can help provid ers counsel families. A cohort of cases in Australia showed affected patients can have neurologic morbiditities including cerebral palsy, epilepsy and developmental delays. A different prospective cohort showed that the risk of developmental delay in the s econd year of life was high following PeV hospitalization. Conclusion: Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion and perform PeV CSF analysis in infants presenting with sepsis -like illness, acute neurologic abnormalities, or seizure -like activity even in the absence of CSF pleocytosis. Provider awareness of PeV can facilitate timely diagnosis, focused work up, and guide management of associated morbidities.

Case Description: A 42 year -old-woman visited ED due to renal colic where an abdominal CT imaging revealed incidental finding of cystic changes at the lung base. Her respiratory symptoms at the time were mild dyspnea on excretion and weight loss. Her social history was significant for 15 pack years of smoki ng. Spirometry showed normal lung functions. HRCT of the chest showed innumerable small round cysts bilaterally evenly distributed from apex to base, small pulmonary nodules and lymph nodes within the mediastinum. A provisional diagnosis of Lymphangioleiom yomatosis (LAM) was made based on clinical and radiological appearance. However, PLCH was in the differential due to similar cystic lung changes and smoking history. Considering her minimal symptoms with normal lung functions, an extensive treatment was no t indicated and was managed with complete abstinence from cigarette smoking and avoidance of exogenous estrogens. Due to insurance restrictions, a conclusive diagnosis was not made and she was lost to follow up. Her symptoms gradually worsened over the nex t 5 years with recurrent episodes of bronchitis requiring antibiotics and interval worsening of PFT that showed mild obstructive lung disease and reduced DLCO. Repeat CT chest revealed no significant change in bilateral cysts or nodules. Video -assisted tho racoscopic surgery (VATS) was conducted and the histology showed numerous Langerhans cells on immunostaining for S100 and CD1a. Staining for HMB45 was negative. Mutation for the BRAF gene was negative. Her initial treatment was corticosteroids and cladribi ne. A follow -up CT of her chest after treatment showed a decrease in the size of bilateral pulmonary nodules without significant change in the size of the cysts. Later she developed a rash on her bilateral lower limbs suggestive of extrapulmonary presentat ion of PLCH and was treated with vinblastine, MTX and 6MP. Her PET - CT was negative for FDG avid lesions. She was followed up in the office and had functional and symptomatic improvement in her overall status. Discussion: PLCH is principally seen in adult s between the ages 20 and 40 years. It is a smoking -related lung disease. Abnormalities described on HRCT are lung cysts which vary in size, have thin walls and tend to be pleomorphic, often sparing the lung base. The combination of nodular and cystic chan ges in HRCT is highly characteristic of PLCH. Unlike, in this case the patient's radiological findings were more characteristic of LAM which usually presents with multiple small round cysts of relatively uniform size, shape and distribution. As a result, w hile clinical features and imaging findings can be used to make a provisional diagnosis, analysis of biopsy tissue may be important for appropriate diagnosis.

Marin, MD [1], Ankita Prasad, MD [2], Research Assistant at OUMC [10] Internal Medicine Program Director This is a case of a 27 -year-old male with no past medical history who presented for worsening left sided pleuritic chest pain, fever, productive cough with whit e sputum and dyspnea on rest and exertion. For 3 months he had been having similar symptoms where he was initially diagnosed with persistent pneumonia. He was treated with multiple antibiotics without much relief. The patient reported having night sweats, but denied any weight loss, hemoptysis or testicular swelling. Patient's denied negative for tobacco use, vaping, alcohol or sexual activity. He denied any sick contacts or recent travel. The patient worked with spray paint and denied using any protection. On physical exam there were bilateral decreased lung sounds on auscultation. In the ED chest X -Ray showed a large peripherally based mass involving the right upper and mid lung zones. A CT -angiogram was ordered to rule out a pulmonary embolism, which show ed extensive multifocal pneumonia with dense right upper lobe and left lower lobe consolidation, abscesses within the consolidated left lower lobe and numerous bilateral pulmonary nodules with cavitating nodules in the right lower lobe. However, one week b efore admission the patient underwent a bronchoscopy or the right upper lobe, transbronchial biopsy and EBUS performed at the level 7 lymph node due to his persistent symptoms. In the ED Pathology was first noted to be positive for adenocarcinoma. On admis sion his vitals were within normal limits. Pertinent labs include WBC 13, D -dimer 665. Hematology/oncology and thoracic surgery planned for a Video -assisted thoracic surgery biopsy as well as a Positron emission tomography scan as outpatient. Brain MRI and CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis were negative for masses, metastasis or lymphadenopathy. Due to the fact that the patient had been having fevers inpatient ID started him on antibiotics for 10 -14 days.Discussion/Conclusion:About 2% -5% of all lung cancer case s are found in people under 40 years. Adenocarcinoma is the most prevalent type of lung cancer. Like all other lung cancers, it is related to tobacco use, but it is also the most frequently diagnosed lung cancer in nonsmokers. It often grows more slowly th an other lung tumors, although it can also spread in its early stages. Young adults are most frequently diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. Pneumonic -type lung adenocarcinoma is an adenocarcinoma with pneumonia -like infiltration or consolidations involving regions in the lungs. It is characterized by ground -glass opacity or consolidation on a chest CT that resembles infectious or inflammatory lung disease. Early clinical manifestations of pneumonic lung cancer resemble most forms of pneumonia. Cancer cells can grow and spread, which can cause secondary infections, bleeding in the lungs, pulmonary embolism, and other symptoms. Clinicians must remember this type of lung cancer particularly in patients presenting with clinical and radiological signs indicative of unresolved pneumonia.

Prior to onset, the patient had no difficulties ambulating but now requires a walker for assistance. She also began having mild bilateral hand tremors with decreased size and legibility of handwriting. Shortly after initial symptom onset, she began having COVID and isolation based anxiety, and subsequently had cognit ive impairment described as fogginess, forgetfulness, word -finding and short -term memory difficulties, while long-term memory remained intact. The patient noted progressive multitasking difficulties and depth perception impairment, later noted to be signif icant visuo -spatial defects in the absence of ocular disease. As these symptoms progressed, she developed urge incontinence with increased frequency despite medical therapy. An MRI showed moderate hydrocephalus and microvascular disease. Further evaluation demonstrated a major neurocognitive disorder that may be multifactorial, though with a suggestion of PCA based on neuropsychological testing. Labs and testing included failure of symptom resolution on large -volume lumbar puncture (normal pressure), a norm al cisternogram, and negative/normal labs, which included CSF testing (with testing for 14 -3-3 tau). A PET scan suggested a lack of a degenerative process. Conclusion: Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) is characterized by neurodegeneration of the posterior cortical regions of the brain causing visuospatial deficits in the absence of ocular disease with an insidious onset and gradual progression. In contrast to other forms of dementia, episodic memory, verbal fluency and personal insights are relatively pres erved. In a patient presenting with symptoms of mild dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence, the clinical suspicion for Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) increases. The NPH triad can mimic the effects of normal aging and neurodegenerative d iseases but the pathophysiology is different and often reversible. However, NPH -like symptoms can present in PCA likely due to alterations in CSF flow contributing to changes in intracranial pressure. There are two proposed pathophysiological mechanisms of CSF accumulation to explain why these symptoms may occur in the setting of PCA. One mechanism includes the failure of drainage of vasoactive metabolites, creating an environment that promotes PCA characteristics. Another mechanism includes the loss of the Windkessel effect in the skull base arteries, causing focal brain damage manifesting as ventriculomegaly while simultaneously lowering cerebral blood flow which leads to NPH symptoms and cerebral hypoperfusion. This presentation of NPH symptoms with a sub optimal response to a large volume lumbar puncture and signs of visuospatial deficits in the absence of hallmark clinical and radiographic features for more common causes of dementia, have led to a working diagnosis of idiopathic PCA.

She presented with significant mental status change and intractable vomiting. Upon arrival, she was found to have severe metabolic acidosis with a pH of 6.9, hyperkalemia (6.3 mmol/L), hypoglycemia (52 mg/dL), and acute kidney injury with a very low bicarbonate level (<5 mmol/mL) and elevated lactate level (12 mmol/L). The patient received urgent hemodialysis along with sodium bicarbonate, dextrose, insulin, and calcium gluconate. Her condition improved dramatically within 24 hours, with a reversal of acidosis, a reduction in potassium levels, and more than 50% lactate clearance. After 48 hours in the ICU, the patient was discharged in a clinically improved condition. Conclusion: Metformin -associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a tially life - threatening complication of metformin use, a widely prescribed medication for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Lactic acidosis arises from an imbalance between lactic acid production and utilization. Our case highlights the importance of recognizing M ALA as a potential complication of metformin use and emphasizes the need for prompt treatment. Healthcare providers should be vigilant in monitoring patients on metformin for signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis, especially in those with renal insufficien cy, and intervene promptly if necessary to prevent morbidity and mortality.

On initial evaluation she had right lower extremity (RLE) weakness which subsequently progressed to monoplegia. Imaging was significant for severe central canal stenosis with compression at T4 -5, and a small resection epidural plasmacytoma. Further imaging confirmed evidence of myeloma throughout the spine. Postoperatively there was continued weakness in her RLE however after admission to acute rehabilitation, she saw the return of more proximal strength and was eventually able to regain some ambulation with therapies. Unfortunately she had to leave acute rehabilitation to obtain further treatment of her newly confirmed diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM), howev er she was able to continue making significant functional gains during that time. Discussion/ Conclusion: MM is a rare plasma cell malignancy with a lifetime risk of approximately 0.76% and makes up only 10% of all hematologic malignancies. The typical presenting symptoms include fatigue, malaise, and bone pain. This case demonstrates a unique presentation of MM that includes monoplegia due to central nervous system compression; CNS involvement of plasmacytomas are exceedingly rare. This case report highlights the unique presentation and rare incidence of MM presenting as monoplegia with plasmacytoma involveme nt. This patient's course should serve as a reminder to remain vigilant when evaluating lower extremity weakness.

The day before presentation she had poor suck, did not feed well, and had no wet diapers. She was given a fingertip of honey 2 weeks prior to presentation, and there was an active construction site near the home. On examination, the patient was well nourished but ill appearing with ptosis, poor suck reflex, weak cry, hypotonia, and rhinorrhea. Reflexes were present in all extremities. Neurosonogram was unremarkable. EMG/NCS confirmed a presynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder (Botulism) and the patient was given a one time dose of Infant Botulism Immune Globulin Intravenous (BabyBIG -IV) with significant improvement. After treatment, the stool cultures confirmed botulinum toxin type B in the stool. The patient was later discharged home in stable condition. Discussion/ Conclusion: Infantile Botulism in the USA is a rare occurrence with approximately 77 cases annually. EMG/NCS was performed with repetitive nerve stimulation, where there was decrement noted in two different motor nerves, and evidence of ongoing denervation in the rig ht bicep and early recruitment in others. Due to the potency of botulinum toxin at the neuromuscular junction, the muscle fibers are essentially chemo -denervated and fibrillations and positive sharp waves are common. With EMG/NCS confirmation the patient w as able to be successfully treated with BabyBIG -IV, even prior to the results of the stool cultures thus highlighting the utility of an EMG/NCS in this setting. This case report highlights the necessity of an early EMG/NCS study when botulism is suspected. This patient had the unfortunate exposure from two potential sources, however EMG/NCS was able to confirm the suspected diagnosis of infantile botulism even prior to stool culture results.

Department of Gastroenterology, Hackensack Meridian Health, Palisades Medical Center, North Bergen, NJ, USA Learning Objective: 1) The Importance of Early Diagnosis and Treatment of Gallstone Ileus (GI) 2) Vigila nce for the atypical presentation of GI Case Summary: A 62 -year-old female presented to the hospital with a one -day history of acute abdominal pain, shortness of breath, and bilious emesis. Abdominal pain was diffuse, intermittent, and colicky associated with nausea and non -bloody bilious vomiting. The rest of the systemic review was unremarkable. She had a history of essential hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She had no history of prior surgeries. She denied alcohol use, smoking, or any illicit drug use. Her family history was non -contributory to the presenting symptoms. Home medications were amlodipine and pravastatin. On admission, vitals were relatively stable. Pertinent positives on physical exam included a moderately distended abdomen with mild tender ness on deep palpation diffusely, especially in upper abdominal quadrants, tympanic to percussion throughout with hyperactive bowel sounds, and decreased air entry on the bases of bilateral lungs with bibasilar crackles. Labs were significant for a WBC cells/uL, serum creatinine U/L, mg/dl. Hemoglobin, bilirubin, AST, ALT, ALP, and lactate were within normal limits. CXR revealed nonspecific bilateral interstitial and airspace opacification, with a severely d ilated, air -filled stomach. Subsequently, the patient had several episodes of vomiting associated with hypotension, and severe hypoxia leading to cardiac arrest with ROSC after CPR. Abdominal X -ray revealed dilated small bowel loops consistent with small b owel obstruction (SBO). She was intubated and an orogastric tube was placed with 4L. of bilious output. The rectal tube was noted to have excessive bile -colored liquid stool. CT abdomen with contrast demonstrated findings concerning for gallstone ileus as an etiology for her SBO and hematological the above -mentioned findings, which led to hypoxemia and cardiac arrest. A laparoscopic enterotomy was performed and the gallstone wa s removed. The patient clinically improved and was discharged with a follow -up for elective cholecystectomy. Discussion: This case highlights the importance of an early diagnosis and treatment of GI. CXR demonstrated a severely dilated and air -filled sto mach. Abdominal X -ray showed findings pointing towards SBO after the cardiac arrest and CT abdomen with contrast was not performed earlier in the clinical course. Physicians should be vigilant with a high suspicion for GI when a patient presents with SBO, especially if the most common causes have been ruled out based on history taking, as a delay in diagnosis could lead to catastrophic complications. In addition, biliary output from the nasogastric or dark bile -colored stools should provide an additional cl ue for life -threatening GI.

In the emergency department, the patient was given cefepime, vancomycin, high- intensity heparin, and a 1 -liter bolus of normal saline, and was placed on a 3 -liter nasal cannula. The patient was initially treated on the general medicine floor but was upgraded to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) for refractory hypotension r equiring vasopressors. During his hospital course, a large amount of urine output with low specific gravity and an elevated serum sodium level was noted. A recent outpatient magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was reviewed which was concerning for a pi tuitary/pituitary stalk lesion. Given the increased urinary output, lab results, and prior imaging, endocrinology was consulted and serum cortisol and TSH were checked. The serum cortisol uIU/mL (0.300 4.500 The patient diabetes insipidus, central hypothyroidism, and central adrenal insufficiency. He was treated with desmopressin, levothyroxine, and steroids. The patient responded well and was eventually downgraded out of the ICU to the g eneral medical floor. Unfortunately, given his grave overall prognosis and declining performance status, the patient was eventually discharged on home hospice. Discussion/ Conclusion: This case strengthens the literature surrounding hypophysitis as a rare , but serious, complication of immunotherapy use. A recent study, consisting of 69 reported cases of anti -PD-1 induced hypophysitis, demonstrated that 90% of patients had long -term hypopituitarism, 6% had pituitary function recovery, and 4% of patients exp erienced death [1]. In addition, a review article from 2019 focusing on the adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors demonstrates the myriad of potential endocrinopathies associated with anti -PD-1 medications and the outcomes of each scenario [2]. Ea rly diagnosis is crucial in improving patient outcomes. With the increasing use of PD -1 checkpoint inhibitors as immuno -oncologic agents, it is important to consider endocrinologic etiologies when faced with unusual hemodynamic instability. Although our pa tient's outcome was ultimately terminal, the correction of his blood pressure and inpatient recovery was a direct result of timely diagnosis of hypophysitis and prompt action taken thereafter.

Free flaps are often chosen despite a high risk of complications associated with the surgery. We present a patient with a chronic SPI treated by an alterna tive method using Kerecis\u00ae acellular fish skin graft (FSG) to achieve early full closure. Due to its native dermal structure, porosity, biomechanical properties and natural bacterial barrier rich in Omega 3 fatty acids, the FSG help facilitate the formatio n of granulation tissues and allow faster wound closure. The aim of this case report is to describe a novel skin graft manufactured from fish skin that could prove beneficial in the treatment of chronic SPI. Objective: We present a new treatment approach f or chronic stage IV SPI using FSG in conjunction with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) in a single case report. Several mechanical debridements along with wet to dry dressing changes and collagenase were performed to ensure a clean and healthy wound bed prior to grafting. NPWT was used to help with tissue granulation to achieve the optimal wound size for grafting. Initial application of the FSG was done in the operating room and NPWT was used to secure the graft. Weekly NPWT dressing changes were perf ormed a in the outpatient setting and wound healing progress was assessed by photographs and measurements. Case Summary: An 80 -year-old male patient with hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, atrial fibrillation and Covid -19 infection presents for manag ement of a chronic stage IV SPI that developed 1.5 years ago. The initial SPI measured 11 x 11 x 2cm. In May 2021, the patient underwent serial mechanical debridements. The wound was dressed with wet to dry dressings along with collagenase and transitioned to NPWT after 2 weeks to achieve tissue granulation optimal for graft application. At the time of graft application, the wound measured 3.5 x 5 x 1cm. A vascular wound bed was achieved after sharp excision and debridement. FSG was placed directly on the w ound followed by a knitted cellulose acetate fabric impregnated with petrolatum emulsion and NPWT. The NPWT was placed to -125mmHg suction. NPWT was changed weekly at an outpatient clinic and serial dimensions were taken to monitor wound healing progressio n. Results: Significant granulation tissue and a decrease in wound depth by half was noted within the first month of FSG application. NPWT kept the wound clean and well vascularized, which allowed for optimal healing. Over 6 months, the wound demonstrated complete wound closure after just one application of Kerecis\u00ae FSG. Discussion: Surgical management of SPI faces many complication risks such as wound dehiscence, ulcer recurrence, and infection, leading to higher rate of hospitalization and prolonged hosp ital stay. The above case represents an example of FSG application in treating chronic SPI.

[1] Hackensack Meridian Health Palisades Medical Center, North Bergen, NJ Case summary: A 57 year old woman with no past medical history presented to the hospital for 3 weeks of weakness, fatigue, progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion. A month ago, she had fever and vomiting for two days following a bite on her thigh preceded by erythe matous plaque. On physical examination, she had tachycardia, distended jugular veins, a loud diastolic murmur in the right upper sternal border, bilateral crackles on lung auscultation, and bilateral lower extremity edema. She also had thrombocytopenia at 36,000/uL, electrolyte abnormalities with hyponatremia at a sodium of 119 mmol/L, hypokalemia at a potassium of 3.1 mmol/L, and a highly elevated BNP at 2,563 pg/mL. Chest x -ray showed vegetations aortic leaflets and a normal LVEF of 60% with grade III diastolic dysfunction. The blood cultures were identified as Erysipelothrix Rhusiopathiae (E. Rhusiopathiae). Her antib iotics were switched to Penicillin G. The patient continued to decline with continued shortness of breath. Pre -operative transesophageal echocardiogram showed vegetations on three aortic valve leaflets, no abscess, and ECG showed sinus tachycardia. The patient underwent aortic valve replacement where she had a fistula between the aortic valve and right atrium (Gerbode defect) that she also underwent closure of fistula, and valvular abscess was also found in pathology. Discussion: Our case highlights a rare case of E. Rhusiopathiae infection that led to aortic valve endocarditis and congestive heart failure that required valve replacement which concomitantly had electrolyte imbalance and thrombocytopenia. Transmission of E. Rhusiopathiae has also been seen f rom blood -sucking insects to birds. Although the source of transmission could not be confirmed for our patient, it can be inferred from the history of insect bite. There is no known data for electrolyte abnormality in the setting of E. Rhusiopathiae bacter emia. The hypo -osmolar hyponatremia in the setting of the initial high BNP in our patient can reveal the presence of heart failure preserved ejection fraction. Our patient also had thrombocytopenia which literature shows thrombocytopenia and arteritis like ly due to neuraminidase inhibitors was found in the rats infected with E. Rhusiopathiae. Besides endocarditis, during the surgery, our patient was found to have a Gerbode defect. It is mainly caused by surgery, however, some non -iatrogenesis causes can be due to Myocardial Infarction (MI), blunt cardiac trauma, and endocarditis. The rationale behind the endocarditis -induced Gerbode defect is the reopening of the congenital defect in the membranous atrio -ventricular septum due to inflammation. Recognizing so me unusual manifestations of E. Rhusiopathiae infections that previously were not reported in the literature, can lighten up the approach for future consideration.

Helen [2], Shuvendu Sen MD [1] [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune, New Jersey, USA [2]Department of Hematology -Oncology, Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune, New Jersey, USA [3]Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, Hackensack, New Jersey, USA Case Summary: A female in her 60s presented to the hospital for shortness of breath and persistent low -grade fever over the past month. Physical exam was significant for an anxious female with no pallor, jaundice, or skin lesions. Labs on admission were significant for normocytic anemia of 6.2 (ref: 13.2 -17.5 g/dL), thrombocytopenia 2018.4 (ref: 11 - 307 ng/mL). Peripheral blood smear 2 to 3+ schistocytes, tear drop cells, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, and promyelo cytes. During her admission, she had refractory anemia and thrombocytopenia despite multiple transfusions. Subsequent testing revealed an IL2 -R level of 5687 (ref: 532 - 1891 pg/mL), and NK cells were normal at 166 (ref: 70 760 cells/uL). Genetic abnorma lities t(15;17) and BCR ABL were negative. Overall her H -score was 136 suggesting a 9 -16% chance of HLH. Bone marrow biopsy dysplasia with evidence of hemophagocytosis. These findings were most consistent with CMML -1 vs very high -risk MDS (5q and 7q deletion) complicated by secondary HLH (met 5/9 criteria) (Figure 1). She was treated with etoposide, dexamethasone taper, and as nee ded tocilizumab. On week 3 of etoposide, she was started on a 7-day course of azacitidine. Unfortunately, the patient expired due to opportunistic infections prior to the completion of her treatment. Discussion/Conclusion: HLH is a rare life -threatening s yndrome characterized by immune dysregulation resulting in an uncontrolled inflammatory response. Primary HLH is inherited but secondary HLH results from an underlying disease such as malignancy. The mortality of HLH is extremely high however due to its no n-specific presentation, it is often missed. The current diagnostic criteria were proposed by the HLH -2004 study. In a 2016 systematic review of the treatment of HLH in adults, initial treatment almost always included glucocorticoids but otherwise treatmen t strategies varied widely. In general, treatment was targeted toward the underlying cause. In these studies, all except two used etoposide -based regimens. CHOP chemotherapy was used for patients with lymphoma or EBV -associated HLH. A small number of patie nts underwent hematopoietic cell therapy (HCT). Overall the mortality rate was approximately 42%. It was seen that lymphoma -associated HLH was an adverse prognostic factor associated with a higher mortality rate and autoimmune HLH had the lowest mortality. Other adverse prognostic markers included highly elevated ferritin, marked thrombocytopenia, lack of etoposide therapy, and low albumin. HLH is a life -threatening illness that is often missed, highly fatal, and may be the first sign of an underlying malig nancy. We recommend that more studies should be done to improve treatment guidelines in adult patients with HLH.

On arrival at the hospital, she was noted to have PEA. Post ACLS, Naloxone was administered, and ROSC was achiev ed. She was subsequently intubated and transferred to the ICU to manage the acute respiratory failure of unclear etiology, likely secondary to polysubstance abuse based on history. Caregivers reported that due to her recent bouts of severe depression, she was using Fentanyl patches and other illicit substances and was prescribed Alprazolam. The urine drug screen was positive for benzodiazepines, cocaine, and cannabinoids. Initially, during her ICU stay, the patient could not tolerate spontaneous breathing t rials. Initial Transthoracic Echocardiogram showed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 50 -55% with mild to moderate right ventricular dilation and hypokinesis. Despite appropriate ventilatory adjustments, tachycardia and hypoxia were noted. CT che st PE protocol was hence ordered and demonstrated acute saddle embolus straddling the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery and extending into the left upper lobe artery with additional pulmonary emboli seen in the right and left lower lobe subsegmental pulmonary arteries without evidence of pulmonary hypertension or right heart strain. Weight - based Enoxaparin therapy was initiated, and a subsequent Echocardiogram 6 days later showed an LVEF of 65 -70% with minimal right ventricular dilation and normal ri ght ventricular systolic function. The patient was subsequently extubated, transitioned to oral apixaban, and discharged after medical optimization with outpatient follow -up. Conclusion: Due to prolonged immobilization and decreased muscle movement involv ed in benzodiazepine overdoses, there is an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Conversely, Cocaine, being a sympathomimetic, promotes tachycardia, dysrhythmia, hypertension, and coronary vasospasm. A wide array of pulmonary complications from bronch ospasm to vasospasm leading to pulmonary infarction and defects in perfusion that present as PE on ventilation -perfusion scan can also be attributed to cocaine. Cocaine has been linked to rapid clotting, increased platelet activation, and increased activit y of plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI -1), associated with an increased risk of clot formation. To our knowledge, this is the first case of co -ingestion of benzodiazepine and cocaine leading to acute saddle PE. Both benzodiazepine and cocaine ove rdoses, by themselves, increase the risk of venous thromboembolism. When ingested together, these risks are amplified, and clinicians should be mindful of this when caring for patients with overdose secondary to co -ingestion of unknown toxic substances.

Although she benefited from prior injections, she failed to have persistent imp rovement despite escalating doses to 500 units with her pain and position returning to baseline within 4 -6 weeks. At rest, her head and neck were side -bent at 80\u00b0 with head resting on right shoulder and any motion limited by pain. Recent injection of 400 u nits resulted in symptomatic dysphagia lasting 6 weeks. Despite this adverse event (AE), overall benefit was sufficient and she insisted on continued injections. Total dose was decreased to 200 units per injection session and the interval shortened to 8 we eks. This regimen was well tolerated and head position greatly improved without AEs. More importantly, the improved position and pain relief were maintained without loss of benefit between injections. *Discussion* Cervical dystonia (CD) is a movement diso rder characterized by involuntary contractions of cervical muscles, which cause abnormal head movements and postures. Repeated botulinum toxin injections are first -line treatment for CD with current standard of care dictating at least 3 -months between inje ction sessions to minimize adverse effects and risk of toxin immunoresistance. Growing evidence, however, suggests no significant increase in adverse effect rates with injection intervals shorter than 3 -months. In our patient, the combined decrease in dosa ge with increase in injection frequency resulted not only in significant and prolonged symptom improvement but also decreased the recurrence of adverse effects. *Conclusion* Our case highlights the necessity to update the current botulinum toxin injection guidelines to better address our patient needs. In some patients, the combination of shorter inter - injection intervals with lowered dosage per injection session can result in improved symptoms and decreased adverse event rates.

Radiographs of the left shoulder were negative for subluxation and fracture. Likewise, venous and arterial duplex studies were unremarkable. His discomfort was initial ly assumed to be centrally related, however, electrodiagnostic studies revealed underlying acute left middle and lower trunk plexopathy potentially contributing to his pain. He was then treated with a renally -dosed regimen of gabapentin which significantly improved his pain and led to improved participation during therapies. *Discussion* Post-stroke shoulder pain (PSSP) is a common problem in stroke survivors that can hamper a patient's recovery and therapy participation. Individuals with hemiplegia are susceptible to PSSP due to traction of the brachial plexus or from downward shoulder subluxation resulting in increased tension on the axillary nerve. In the current literature, there is a lack of electrodiagnostic analysis regarding these patients. Prior sm all scale studies have shown that PSSP secondary to brachial plexus injury is due to lesions specifically of the upper trunk; however our patient was found to have damage to the middle and lower trunks. *Conclusion* This unique case highlights the need fo r electrodiagnostic studies in the setting of PSSP. Large scale studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms of injury surrounding brachial plexus injuries in these patients. Through comprehensive evaluation, we were able to identify the source o f the patient's pain as a brachial plexus injury that would have likely remained hidden given the complex medical picture.

It is known to commonly metastasize to the bone. Identifying rare locations for prostatic metastasis, such as the thyroid, helps us better understand the wide spectrum of presentations we can encoun ter. It is also rare to see a \"collision tumor\" of prostatic metastases with a primary tumor of the thyroid. This makes our case an especially valuable addition to the literature. Case Description : A 49 year old male with a family history of bladder cance r, remote history of tobacco use 17 years prior, presented to our hospital with a complaint of worsening right groin pain. On admission, a CT Abdomen Pelvis osseous in the re troperitoneum and pelvis, along with an enlarged prostate gland. The CT Chest showed nonspecific thyroid nodules, and the bone scan showed diffuse osteoblastic metastatic disease. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) was elevated at 1430 ng/ml. Thyroid stimulat ing hormone (TSH) was 3.043 limits. lymph node biopsy showed metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with prostatic primary. The patient was started on Casodex and received cycle 1 of taxotere inpatient. Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the left thyroid gland revealed both Bethesda category II and Malignancy Bethesda category V cells. A Molecular panel resulted as BRAF p:V600E positive. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy. Pathology results were consistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Immunostains for one area were positive for TTF -1 and classified as well circumscribed/encapsulated papillary thyroid carcinoma. Immunostains performed on another slide within a follicular variant showed a 3mm area that was negative for TTF -1 but positive for NKX3, PSA, PSMA. Based on clinical correlation with the patient's history of metastatic prostate carcinoma, this area was classified as metastatic prostatic carcinoma to a well circumscribed/encapsulat ed papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular variant. On outpatient follow up, the patient completed six cycles of chemotherapy, and remains on androgen ablation therapy. He is scheduled to be treated with radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) and will continue w ith surveillance scans. Discussion : Metastasis from prostate to thyroid is exceedingly rare. \"Collision tumor\" refers to the rare phenomenon where a single anatomical site serves as the location for two histologically distinct tumors. Our patient had meta static prostatic carcinoma in the thyroid which was negative for TTF -1, as well as a separate lesion which was completely positive for TTF -1, confirming its likely origins in the thyroid. Hence, this patient was found to have two histologically distinct lesions co -existing in the same organ. Our case is interesting as it also poses the question of whether the follicular variant papillary thyroid cancer developed before or a Abstract # 95 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 95 ELEVATED CATECHOLAMINES: A CASE OF FALSE ALARM Jonathan Figueroa, MD [1] Jennif er Cheng, DO [2] [1] Department of Endocrinology Hackensack Meridian Health, Jersey Shore University Medical Center Neptune, NJ Case Summary: A 64 year old female presented to our Endocrinology office for evaluation for an incidentally found left adrenal nodule found 2 years prior and recently found elevated catecholamine levels. Her past medical history included Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Parkinson's disease, and anxiety. At the time of the appointment, her medications were carbidopa -levodopa, levothyroxin e, venlafaxine and estradiol. The patient reported that she had episodic feelings of anxiety and nervousness throughout the day, and daily regular headaches. During these episodes she reported nausea and vomiting associated with dizziness. Her physical exa m was grossly unremarkable except for anxious mood. Regarding her adrenal nodule, it was initially discovered when she underwent CT abdomen and pelvis during work up for irritable bowel syndrome which revealed a 1.4 x 1.0 cm nodule in the left adrenal glan d and repeat imaging was conducted two years later which revealed a stable left sided adrenal nodule 7 Hounsfield units with washout at 60%. The patient also underwent an Iobenguane i -123 scan which revealed no evidence of pheochromocytoma. She had also co mpleted laboratory testing which showed elevated total catecholamines 7862 pg/mL range: normal norepinephrine, epinephrine, and metanephrines. Repeat lab work done prior t o the appointment revealed similar results. Discussion/Conclussion: The incidence of adrenal nodules found fortuitously during imaging studies has increased over the years. It is common practice to determine if the nodule found is malignant and exclude hy persecreting tumors such as pheochromocytomas and aldosterone producing tumors. This commonly leads to testing which can be done by primary care teams or through referrals to endocrinology. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are very rare tumors with an incidence of 0.6 per 100,000 and a literature review by Miyamoto found only 33 individual cases of dopamine secreting tumors. Eisenohofer et al discusses in multiple papers the importance of checking metanephrines as opposed to catecholamines in evaluation of pheochromocytoma as well. Other factors that influenced testing included: posture during blood work, stress during testing, situational factors such as hospitalization and medications which cause interference in screening testing Despite the elevated t otal catecholamines, closer evaluation revealed it was significantly elevated solely due to the dopamine levels in the blood. Given the patient's longstanding history of Parkinson's disease well controlled with carbidopa - levodopa, it was reasonable to conc lude that this was a medication induced elevated dopamine level and highly unlikely a catecholamine producing tumor. It was decided to monitor her clinically as opposed to retesting her off her current regimen to avoid worsening of her Parkinson's symptoms .

Rhabdoid tumor predisposition syndrome (RTPS) is characterized by familial cases as a result of pathogenic germline variants of this gene and an increased risk of developing ATRT within the first 2 years of life, which carries a poor prognosis. Genetic penetrance is incomplete with variable expressivity but the patient's age at time of diag nosis remains the most significant indicator of survival. We present a case of RTPS in a sibship born to unaffected parents, one of which was a carrier. The first sibling was diagnosed at 8 months of age after presenting with vomiting, developmental regres sion, and CN VI palsy for 3 months. Imaging revealed a posterior fossa mass, acquired obstructive hydrocephalus, and spinal metastasis. Four years later, her 3 - month -old sister was brought in for evaluation due to vomiting, irritability, and macrocephaly f or 2 months, along with a new vertical gaze palsy. Imaging findings also showed a posterior fossa mass and acquired obstructive hydrocephalus but without metastasis. Both siblings underwent craniotomy with subtotal tumor resection and ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. Chemotherapy was promptly initiated but despite active treatment, they had rapid disease progression and ultimately passed away. Whole exome sequencing of both patients revealed an in-frame deletion involving the SNF5 homology domain of SM ARCB1, with consistent findings on whole transcriptome sequencing, and evidence of loss of a single copy of chromosome 22. In this case report, we present a family faced with the devastating outcomes of RTPS and emphasize the importance of genetic testing and counseling for these families after diagnosis in the first child. Families should also be streamlined to a fertility specialist prior to subsequent pregnancies as an opportunity for familial screening.

We demonstrate an unusual case of systemic sarcoidosis with histopathology yielding necrotizing granulomas. Th is case highlights that there likely is a spectrum of sarcoidosis based on degree of necrosis and the importance of excluding other disorders. Case Summary: A 52 -year-old female presented with few months history of dizziness, fatigue, weight loss, abdomin al pain and shortness of breath. She underwent outpatient positron emission tomography scan which showed hypermetabolic lymph nodes in the chest, abdomen, liver, spleen, bone marrow and extensive nodular opacities in the lungs. She had no risk factors for tuberculosis. On presentation, she was in third degree heart block though hemodynamically stable. ACE level was elevated at 182 (reference range 9 -67 U/L); QuantiFERON, lymphoma panel flow cytometry, ANCA, hepatitis C were negative. Computerized to showed mediastinal, hilar lymphadenopathy, diffuse bronchovascular thickening, hepatic heterogeneity numerous splenic lesions. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was suggestive of a infiltrative process. Liver biopsy granulomatous negative for acid -fast bacilli. Despite findings of necrotizing granulomas, there was a high suspicion for sarcoidosis, therefore bronchoscopy was deferred and steroids were started w ith subsequent improvement in symptoms. Discussion: Given the wide spectrum of multi -organ involvement and non -specific clinical symptoms, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis relies heavily on the presence of non -necrotizing granulomas and the exclusion of other causes of granulomas. Our patient had the complete typical features of sarcoidosis including cardiac, lung, liver, spleen and lymph nodes involvement. However, the biopsy showed focally necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. In such a case, important dif ferentials that must be excluded are infectious etiologies (notably mycobacterium), lymphoproliferative disorders, and other inflammatory diseases like vasculitis. The histochemical stains, cultures and flow cytometry were not consistent with these other etiologies. The other main differential to consider is necrotizing sarcoid granulomatosis (NSG) which is a rare systemic disease characterized by sarcoid -like granulomas, vasculitis and variable degrees of necrosis. There has been a debate whether NSG is a variant of sarcoidosis or a separate entity in itself. While there were areas of necrosis in the granulomas in this case, there was a lower suspicion for NSG given there were no signs of vasculitis. Conclusion: Our case points to the concept of sarcoidosi s as a disease with a wide spectrum based on the degree of necrosis with classical sarcoidosis on one end to NSG on the other with cases such as ours in the middle of the spectrum .

She had recurrence of cancer in the right lung and was on active clinical trial wi th Pembrolizumab and anti-TIGIT EOS -448. Following the initiation of the therapy, she developed peripheral eosinophilia and a skin rash, biopsy of which showed eosinophilic infiltrates favoring a drug reaction, for which she was on Dupilumab. On presentati on, her oxygen saturation was 95% on 4 LPM oxygen, heart rate 108 bpm, and was afebrile. Labs were notable for WBC 12.7 103 u/L (ref range 4 -11), absolute eosinophil count 1400 uL (ref range 0 -700), ESR 120 mm/hr (ref range 0-20), C -reactive range <0.5); ANCA, respiratory pathogen panel, fungitell, aspergillus, and blood negative. Chest computed tomography showed new multifocal infiltrates throughout the right lung. She was started on antibiotics for pneumonia. On hospita l day 2, she developed worsening dyspnea, hypoxia, and fever to 101.5\u00b0F. Empiric steroids were then started for eosinophilic pneumonia given the clinical deterioration despite appropriate antibiotic coverage, the peripheral eosinophilia and radiographic fi ndings. Bronchoscopy was deferred due to the rapid decline and underlying pulmonary history that placed her at further risk of decompensation. The following day, she had significant clinical improvement and her eosinophil count was 0. Following discharge, the clinical therapy was held and she had no recurrence of similar episodes. Discussion: We describe a rare case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) secondary to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) and anti -TIGIT therapy, as well as the associated diagnos tic challenge. ICIs have previously been associated with peripheral eosinophilia as well as rare cases of respiratory involvement including eosinophilic pneumonia or bronchiolitis. However, current literature is scarce in the description of the adverse eff ects of anti -TIGIT therapy. Our patient experienced skin rash, eosinophilia and AEP as a result of this clinical therapy. Furthermore, a diagnostic criterion of AEP includes bronchoscopy findings of eosinophils in lavage fluid. Other reports involving ICIs and AEP have all used bronchoscopy as a means of diagnosis as is standard practice. Given the rapid clinical deterioration in this case despite anti -microbial coverage and underlying high risk history, the presumptive diagnosis of AEP was made without bronchoscopy. The subsequent empiric initiation of steroids proved to have a dramatic clinical response as characteristic of AEP. Conclusion: We highlight that AEP can occur with ICIs as seen with prior reports, though the contribution of anti -TIGIT therapy in this case remains unclear. We also emphasize the clinical judgment of timely initiation of steroids even without a confirmatory bronchoscopy in cases of rapidly progressive AEP.

Simons, MD [3] [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ [2] Structural and Congenital Heart Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ [3] Division of Cardiac Electrophysiology, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ Case Summary: A 76 year -old male with history of persistent atrial fibrillation with a CHA2DS2 -VASc score referred for left atrial appendage closure (LAAC). He was not a candidate for long term anticoagulation due to a previous history of thrombocytopenia and a fall leading to subdural hematoma LAA area 467.0mm2 and average landing zone diameter o f 24.4mm; there was no evidence of thrombus within the LAA. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) demonstrated a \"chicken wing morphology\" of the LAA with an emptying velocity of 49m/s. Under TEE guidance, the atrial septum was crossed via gu idewire puncture and a 27mm Watchman FLX LAA occluder device was successfully placed with no evidence of residual flow. Per shared decision making with neurosurgery, the patient was discharged on short -course of apixaban to be closely monitored as outpatie nt. Discussion/Conclusion: LAAC has become an increasingly utilized method for stroke prevention in patients with contraindications to pharmacologic anticoagulation. Anatomic abnormalities can make access and implantation difficult. Situs inversus totalis, a rare congenital abnormality that affects 1:10,000 people, is characterized by mirror -transposition of both abdominal and thoracic organs. The use of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and three -dimensional cardiac imaging has greatly improve d the ability of physicians to perform necessary cardiac procedures in patients with potentially challenging anatomy. We present a case of successful LAAC using such imaging modalities in a patient with situs inversus totalis with contraindication to long -term oral anticoagulation.

His vitals were stable with normal oxygen saturation on room air. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest showed a large right sided pleural effusion, along with 6 cm pseudocyst and dilatation of the pancreatic duct. A pigtail cathete r was placed that initially drained 3 liters of serosanguinous fluid. Pleural fluid analysis showed amylase 25,538 U/L. Cytology was negative for malignant cells. Octreotide was started and he underwent magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) that showed the known pseudocyst, but no fistula or communicating tract. He ultimately underwent Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) and fine needle aspiration of the pseudocyst that was negative for malignancy. His symptoms improved and he had no further output from the pigtail catheter. Discussion: Acute pancreatitis commonly causes a reactive, small to moderate, left sided pleural effusion in which the pleural fluid amylase is typically in the normal range. Ch ronic pancreatitis may cause a large left pleural effusion with extremely high amylase levels. It is very rare to have a large, right pleural effusion from chronic pancreatitis as in our case. The mechanisms of chronic pancreatic pleural effusion include p ancreatic duct disruption leading to leakage and potential formation of a pancreaticopleural fistula (PPF), or rupture of a pseudocyst. PPFs are extremely rare, characterized by an elevated pleural fluid amylase levels as high as 30 -50k. They should be fur ther investigated by either MRCP, CT or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) that can show a duct communication. There was a high suspicion for pancreatic etiology in this case given the elevated pleural amylase, though the MRCP and CT did not delineate a fistula or a visualized communication with the thoracic cavity. Therefore, we suspect the effusion occurred from either leakage from the pancreatic duct or ruptured pseudocyst in the retroperitoneum with movement of fluid to the pleural sp ace due to the transdiaphragmatic pressure gradient and diaphragmatic defects. Management of large pancreatic pleural effusions typically include total parenteral nutrition, octreotide, and drainage. If a PPF is present, ERCP is required with stent placeme nt or surgical intervention if conservative management fails. Conclusion: It is important to have a high index of suspicion for pancreatic etiology of pleural effusion in patients with history of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis and pseudocyst.

We present a case of a patient with multiple pulmonary comorbidities who was initiated on VV ECMO for severe hypoxemic/hypercapnic r espiratory failure after an accidental chloramine inhalation injury. Case Report A 65 -year-old man, with past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe persistent asthma , and 1.5 pack per day cigarette smoker for thirty years, prese nted with headache and severe shortness of breath after mixing ammonia and chlorine while cleaning his pool; the mixture exploded, resulting in inhalation of toxic fumes. He developed difficulty breathing and hypoxia which was refractory to methylprednisol one, albuterol nebulizers, non - invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) and ultimately required intubation. Given very high peak pressures and inability to ventilate the patient, ECMO was implanted and continued for a total of 13 days. Bronchoscopy a t the time showed a severely edematous tracheobronchial tree without any endobronchial lesions or necrosis. The patient did well and was eventually weaned off of EMCO and explantated. The patient was eventually sent to a rehabilitation facility for physica l therapy and is now home. Discussion: This case demonstrates a novel approach to management of severe non -ARDS chloramine inhalation injury. Since our patient could not oxygenate nor ventilate with lung protective ventilation alone, and bronchoscopy was not remarkable for endobronchial lesions, necrosis, or casts, the decision was made to initiate ECMO. To our knowledge this is a novel approach. ECMO is widely used for ARDS management 2,3, also in ARDS management as a result of chloramine injury4. This pa tient did not have ARDS, but had significant mucosal edema and airway secretions. In this case, ECMO was utilized to allow pulmonary rest and avoid further lung injury, which ultimately proved successful as the patient was extubated, decannulated, and even tually discharged home on no oxygen therapy. Since there is very little research on the utility of ECMO in this specific patient population, further investigation of the utility of ECMO in the treatment of inhalation injury without ARDS is warranted.

SOV aneurysm rupture can present varyingly as acute heart failure, acute coronary syndrome or cardiac tamponade. The aneurysm usually ruptures into the right atrium (RA) or right ventricle (RV) leading to significant left to right shunting and can subsequently cause acute heart failure. Case Summary: A 60 -year-old male with history of hypertension presented with shortness of breath of three days duration. Physical exam revealed elevated jugular venous pressure, shunting o f blood from aorta into the RA via ruptured SOV and moderate dilatation of the RA and RV. A computerized tomography (CT) aortogram showed SOV dehiscence of non -coronary cusp. catheterization and transesophageal echocardiography showed no coronary a rtery disease and confirmed SOV rupture with left to right shunting, respectively. He underwent surgical repair with full recovery. Discussion: A thorough history, physical exam and familiarity of acute structural abnormalities can help clinicians with pr ompt recognition and management of acute heart failure due to SOV aneurysm rupture. Echocardiography is the standard choice to establish diagnosis. CT aortogram can provide supportive information about the defect and assist in pre -surgical assessment. Rupt ure of SOV aneurysm has high morbidity and mortality. Surgical management is typically required in such cases, however the use of transcatheter closure devices have also been described with suitable outcomes. Conclusion: While a rare presentation of acute heart failure, early identification of rupture of SOV aneurysm is critical as timely intervention will result in a favorable long -term outcome.

He endorsed a 20 - pound weight loss without fever, night sweats, or anorexia. Initial physical exam was significant for scleral icterus, jaundice, and a soft abdomen with negative Murphy's sign, minimal disten sion and some mild pain to palpation of the right upper quadrant. Initial laboratory testing revealed a mixed cholestatic and hepatocellular pattern of injury, with a serum U/L, . Serum CA 19 -9 was 24 U/mL was 3.9 ng/mL. Hepatitis serologies and serum lymphoma panel returned negative. A CT of t he abdomen and pelvis with contrast evidenced a normal - appearing liver and pancreas with pronounced common bile duct (CBD) dilation to 1.7 cm. The patient retrograde cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic ultrasound on which demonstra ted a 2.4 cm hypoechoic mass causing distal duct obstruction and compression of the superior mesenteric vein collateralization, dilation to 4 mm. The patient was initially thought to have pancreatic malignancy or cholangiocarcinoma. Subsequent fine needle biopsy revealed diffuse mixed inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils and associated \"storiform fibrosis\" a nd atrophy - a diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP). CD138 staining showed abundant plasma cells with high -number of IgG -4 positive cells. In light of these findings and the high suspicion for AIP, the patient was started on a course of oral steroids. Serum IgG -4 levels and liver function tests obtained on his 4 -week follow -up have significantly decreased and his symptoms have greatly improved. This case of a patient with AIP outlined an example of an already rare disease that was atyp ical in the fact that many of the patient's presenting symptoms, as well as his initial laboratory findings and imagings closely mimicked a possible diagnosis of pancreatic cancer or cholangiocarcinoma. Only a few cases have been reported of AIP with a focal mass. Our case presents an instance where focal AIP with a discrete mass does not exhibit typical findings on EUS/ERCP and CT findings. The patient's rapid response to corticosteroid treatment further supports the diagnosis of AIP. This case serves as a reminder to more closely consider this rare diagnosis in the correct demographic and to be on the lookout for such atypical presentations to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment, as AIP is a disease entity with dramatic response to treatment. Abstract # 104 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 104 HIGH RISK G ASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL TUMOR IN FIRST TRIMESTER PREGNANCY: A CASE REPORT Anna Weinstein, DO [1]; Christina M Sheedy, BS [2]; [1] [1]: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology; Hackensack University Medical Center [2]: Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine Case Summary: A 24 year old G3P1011 presented to the Emergency Department at 4w6d by last menstrual period (LMP) with worsening abdominal cramping, bloating, and associated nausea. Phys ical exam revealed a large, mobile, nontender mass palpated in the right lower abdomen. Transvagianl ultrasound noted the presence of a large pelvic mass of unknown etiology. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was obtained for further characterization , revealing a 7.3 x 12.4 x 12.2 cm mass with multiple fluid levels, centered in the anterior mesentery. Exploratory laparotomy was performed with en bloc resection of small bowel and pelvic mass, with pathology demonstrating a 12.8 cm spindle cell neoplasm compatible with GIST and notable for a mitotic rate of 40 mitoses/50 high power field (HPF). Next generation sequencing (NGS) was pursued in order to predict tumor responsiveness to Imatinib, which revealed a mutation at KIT exon 11, suggesting a response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. The patient's multidisciplinary treatment team, consisting of medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, and maternal fetal medicine specialists, made the recommendation for adjuvant Imatinib therapy. The patient was offered termination of pregnancy with immediate initiation of Imatinib, as well as continuation of pregnancy with either immediate or delayed treatment. Interdisciplinary counseling focused on both the maternal and fetal implications of each proposed manag ement plan. She ultimately elected termination of pregnancy, and underwent an uncomplicated dilation and evacuation. Discussion: There are less than 20 reported cases of gastrointestinal stromal tumors in pregnancy. Of these reported cases, there are only two that detail GIST in the first trimester. We report our experience with the third known GIST diagnosis in the first trimester of pregnancy. Notably, our case report highlights the earliest known gestational age at time of GIST diagnosis. Conclusion: GIST diagnosis in pregnancy is exceedingly rare. Patients with high -grade disease encounter a multitude of decision -making dilemmas, often with competing maternal and fetal interests. As additional cases of GIST in pregnancy are added to the literature, cl inicians will be able to implement evidence -based options counseling for their patients. Shared decision -making is contingent upon patient understanding of diagnosis, risk of recurrence, available treatment options, and the treatment -related implications o n maternal and fetal outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial for optimization of patient -centered care.

To our knowledge, there has never been any d ocumented case report of spontaneous idiopathic bilateral lower extremity compartment syndrome. We describe a case of a 31-year-old male with a past medical history of well -controlled asthma and idiopathic compartment syndrome who developed compartment syn drome of his bilateral lower extremities while intubated due to a metapneumovirus (MPV) -induced asthma attack. He presented for progressive shortness of breath after having a worsening cough over a period of three days, fevers, chills, and malaise. After arrival in the emergency department, he required rapid sequence intubation for respiratory deterioration. A respiratory pathogen panel was later positive for MPV. The patient developed left and right lower extremity compartment syndrome on days two and three of hospitalization respectively. He was diagnosed via subjective report of leg pain, elevated CPK levels, and classic physical exam findings of tense compartments and pain on passive dorsiflexion, and he underwent limb -saving fasciotomies of both legs. Prior etiologies of SCS have been reported such as prolonged lithotomy position, HIV and COVID -19-induced myositis, methanol poisoning, exercise -induced, vibrio vulnificus infection, and horse riding among others (1, 2, 3, 5). This patient was negative for HIV and COVID -19, without toxic ingestions, recent vigorous exercise, other metabolic or endocrinologic disorders, hematologic/leukemic disorder, systemic sclerosis, or trauma to his lower legs prior to or during his hospital admission. The patient does h ave a history of prior SCS of his upper extremity and lower extremities with the last episode occurring seven years ago. Etiology at that time was not discovered after evaluation by rheumatology, general internal medicine, and orthopedics. He was told that he may have chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) despite his prior episodes occurring regardless of exertion, and not meeting the typical diagnostic criteria of CECS (2). In regard to a genetic predisposition to SCS, only one case report exists of a young otherwise healthy man with recurrent SCS who was found to have a novel GYG1 mutation which is a gene responsible for the production of glycogenin (mutations of which have been discovered in a rare glycogen storage disease), however, there is no established link between said mutation and SCS (4). This case emphasizes the importance of having a low threshold for initiating interdisciplinary management for the classical presentation of a common syndrome without a clear etiology, the necessity of tak ing into account the pre -test probability for suspected conditions on a case -by- case basis, and how apt clinical acumen can prove life or limb saving. Abstract # 106 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 106 A UNIQUE PRESENTATION OF METASTATIC PERIVASCULAR EPITHELIOID CELL [1] [1] Department of Family Medicine; Ocean University Medical Center, NJ Case presentation: This is a 64 -year-old female with a 2018 history of uterine carcinosarcoma with poorly differentiated endometrial and leiomyosarcoma components. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy and pathology revealed extrauterine spread. PET/CT showed right h ilar adenopathy and tumor activity. At that time, she was treated with 6 cycles of Carboplatin -Taxol which she tolerated well and had no further issues until a follow up PET/CT in 2020 revealed mediastinal activity. She subsequently underwent mediastinosco py and biopsy suggesting sarcoidosis but no tumor. Later that year, a follow -up PET/CT again demonstrated mediastinal lymph node activity and biopsy showed recurrent tumor consistent with initial uterine pathology. She was again treated with 6 cycles of Ca rboplatin -Taxol which she tolerated well. In December 2020, a follow up PET/CT showed the presence of a lower lobe lung tumor for which she was treated with cyberknife. Her disease course was later complicated by pulmonary embolism and radiation pneumoniti s treated with anticoagulation and steroids respectively. In July 2022, she developed a rapidly growing right thigh/buttock soft tissue mass. The mass was excised and outside pathology at John Hopkins was consistent with a diagnosis of Perivascular Epithel ioid Cell Neoplasms (PEComa). For this, she underwent adjuvant treatment with radiation therapy. In November 2022, the patient presented with failure to thrive and abdominal pain. She was found to have a small bowel obstruction secondary to intussusception and required small bowel resection. Pathology showed that a tumor caused the leading edge of the intussusception and was consistent with her previous pathological findings. She has since recovered from her surgery and is currently being treated with FYARR O. Conclusion: Perivascular Epithelioid Cell Neoplasms (PEComas) are rare subtypes of soft tissue tumors that often form around small blood vessels and can be found in various organs such as the stomach, intestines, lungs, genitourinary and the female rep roductive organs. These tumors have a predominance for females and most PEComas are benign, however some may be malignant. PEComas are exceptionally rare however they should be included in the differential diagnosis when presented with recurrent malignanci es of multiple organs. Although intussusception is also a rare occurrence in adults, comprising <5% of intestinal obstructions, it is important to consider that intestinal metastasis of PEComas may occur. Thus, the existence of multi organ neoplasms with c oncordat pathology should warrant a thorough evaluation during follow up and consideration of PEComa as a diagnosis. Diagnosis of PEComa does require surgical biopsy and immunohistochemical analysis. Tumor resection is currently the mainstay treatment and adjuvant therapy is used in high -risk patients such as ours. Abstract # 107 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 107 ACUTE ISCHEMIC STROKE DUE TO INCOMPLETE ENDOTHELIALIZATION OF A LEFT Internal Medicine, Hackensack University Medical Center, NJ; [2] Department of Interventional Cardiology, Hackensack University Medical Center, NJ Stroke is the most common complication of atrial fibrillation, with 90% of thrombi thought to originate from the lef t atrial appendage (LAA). For decades, anticoagulation has been the mainstay treatment for thromboembolic prophylaxis but is frequently complicated by bleeding events. Left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) has risen as a preferred intervention in patients with high bleeding risk. In a minimally invasive procedure, a device is implanted into the LAA to seal off potential emboli. Current post -treatment protocols involve surveillance imaging for device failure, which assesses peri -device leak (PDL) and incomp lete endothelialization. If measurements fall within accepted parameters, the patient is transitioned off post -procedural anticoagulation to antiplatelet therapy. However studies show that while LAAO significantly decreases bleeding risk, ischemic stroke r isk persists. Our patient is an 80 -year-old man with moderate mitral regurgitation who underwent LAAO but suffered acute ischemic stroke one year later. He underwent mechanical thrombectomy with successful reperfusion. On workup, transesophageal echocardio gram and cardiac computed tomography revealed widening peri - device leak to 6 mm and only partial device endothelialization. Mitral regurgitation was now severe (effective regurgitant orifice area 0.48 cm\u00b2, regurgitant volume 75 ml) with a high velocity pos teriorly directed eccentric jet. Once stable, the patient was followed outpatient, where he decided to defer repair of his mitral valve and LAAO failure in favor of conservative management. Recent studies suggest that characteristics of this patient's LAAO failure might be more common than expected. One study shows that surveillance imaging showed incomplete endothelialization in up to 61% of patients by ~10 months post -procedure. Small PDLs (< 5 mm) are associated with higher stroke risk. While mitral regu rgitation is thought to be protective against thrombus formation in AF, severe disease can contribute to LAAO failure in multiple mechanisms: 1) disturbances in tissue remodeling and device position due to shearing forces of the regurgitant jet, and 2) inh ibition of thrombogenesis, which is paradoxically essential to successful neoendothelialization. Patients with comorbid mitral regurgitation and LAAO eligibility may benefit from concomitant percutaneous mitral valve repair and LAAO, which could offer sign ificant advantages in reducing overall clinical burden for both the patient and interventionalist. In conclusion, LAAO remains a favorable alternative for stroke prophylaxis in patients with high bleeding risk. However PDL and incomplete device endothelial ization are critical complications that are loosely addressed in current protocols. As real -world outcome studies continue to highlight their significance, guidelines are expected to redefine protocols that will allow clinicians to address nuances, interve ne earlier on impending failure, and further reduce stroke risk. Abstract # 108 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 108 A RARE PRESENTATION OF SYNCOPE Laura Torres Cruz, MD [1]; Momina F Rahman, MD [1]; Jonathan Torres Gonzalez, MD [1]; Alexandria Lee D. Ang, MD [1]; Ramsey Jaber, MD [1]; Syed Sirajuddin, MD [1] [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Hackensack Meridian Health -Palisades Medical Center, NJ Case Summary: A 56 -year-old female with a past medical history significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus complicated by diabetic retinopathy an d neuropathy, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension presented with persistent nausea and vomiting that initially started six weeks prior to admission. She reported that her symptoms were intermittent and progressive despite taking Ondansetron at home, and they have become untreatable, prompting her to come to the hospital. The patient described the emesis as non -bilious and non -bloody undigested food with associated fatigue, unintentional weight loss of 26 pounds due to inability to tolerate oral intake, and lon gstanding constipation in the last six weeks. The patient's diabetes has been managed at home with Metformin and Empagliflozin. On arrival, vital signs were remarkable for hypertensive urgency and tachycardia. Laboratory evaluation was notable for blood gl ucose ranging from 201 to 223, bicarbonate 12, anion gap 24, pH 7.3, positive serum acetone, and urine analysis with > 1000 glucose and > 80 ketones. CT scan of the abdomen was unremarkable. The patient was managed in the intensive care unit for euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis with guideline -directed medical therapy. During the hospital course, the patient's emesis persisted, causing clinically significant dehydration, and decreased oral intake. She also had two syncopal episodes while trying to pass bowel movements. Syncope workup was unremarkable. Orthostatic vital signs were positive. As gastroparesis was suspected, the patient was hydrated with intravenous fluids and managed with frequent small meals and Metoclopramide. A gastric emptying study was done while on prokinetic showing rapid emptying. After extensive workup and excluding other causes of syncope, it was attributed to orthostatic hypotension secondary to diabetic autonomic neuropathy (DAN) due to prolonged uncontrolled diabetes. Blood glucose w as monitored and controlled during the hospital course. The patient was treated with guideline -directed medical therapy, supportive treatment, and intensive physical therapy. Discussion/Conclusion: DAN is a severe and often overlooked complication of diab etes mellitus. Cardiac autonomic neuropathy (CAN) is the most significant manifestation of DAN, and its treatment is challenging due to the advancement of the disease; thus, intensive glycemic control coupled with lifestyle modification has been proven to halt or delay the onset and progression of this phenomenon while improving the quality of life. The data describing the symptoms and presentation of CAN is limited. Through this case report, we aim to raise awareness to aid clinicians in identifying patien ts who would be candidates for intensive glycemic control, bring attention to newer medications for euglycemia with proven benefits for overall all -cause mortality, and early recognition of symptoms of DAN that may be masked or mistaken for other condition s to avoid life -threatening complications. Abstract # 109 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 109 A RARE CAUSE OF INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONITIS Laura Torres Cruz, MD [1]; Ramsey Jaber, MD [1]; Jonathan Torres Gonzalez, MD [1]; MD [1] [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Hackensack Meridian Health -Palisades Medical Center, NJ Case Summary: A 39 -year-old female with a past medical history significant for stage 3 breast cancer (Intraductal Carcinoma, Estrogen and Progesterone receptor positive and HER2 negative) presented with persistent objective fevers, reporting temperatures at the highest 103F that started nine days ago after she was started on Taxol for her breast cancer. The patient received four cycles of chemotherapy with neoadjuvant dose -dense (dd) Adriamycin and cyclophosphamide in the past. She started the first cycle of dd -Taxol wi th Onpro ten days prior to admission. She also reported associated shortness of breath, myalgias, and chest tightness that began nine days ago. On arrival, vital signs were remarkable for a temperature of 102 F. Laboratory evaluation, including blood and s putum cultures, respiratory pathogen panel, and pneumonia panel, were unremarkable. CT scan of the chest showed multifocal pneumonitis, as shown in figure 1. Initially, the patient was initiated on empiric antibiotics, including Cefepime and Azithromycin. As infectious causes were ruled out, interstitial pneumonitis was attributed to Taxol, and she was begun on Methylprednisolone with significant and prompt improvement, confirming the clinical suspicion. The patient was discharged on guideline -directed medi cal therapy and instructed to follow up with the pulmonologist, oncology, and primary medical doctor. Discussion/Conclusion: It has been thought that pneumonitis caused by Taxol is induced by a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. Such reactions may occur within days to weeks after receiving Taxol. While Taxol -induced interstitial pneumonitis (TIP) is under -described, this case report will highlight such pulmonary injury with a poorly understood mechanism in the setting of a female patient receiving such an agent to treat breast cancer. TIP, while relatively uncommon, is a possibly fatal condition that must be recognized early while treating patients with cancer. Patients may present with nonspecific symptoms such as fever, shortness of breath, myalgia, and fatigue, and because these symptoms are most typically encountered in the first two cycles of Taxol usage with a higher dosage, this differential should be higher in the list when these symptoms are evident. Once the identification of TIP has been recogniz ed by exclusion, Taxol should be halted, and glucocorticoid therapy should be initiated immediately. Additionally, given that it's not advisable to restart with taxane agents, non -particle albumin -bound paclitaxel (nab - paclitaxel), which exhibits less hype rsensitivity, could be taken into consideration when resuming the patient on chemotherapeutic agents; however, additional research should be conducted prior to switching to these agents. With this case report, we aim to highlight the significance of recogn izing this phenomenon to avoid delay in diagnosis and treatment as well as to contribute to the growing literature in this arena. Abstract # 110 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 110 AN ATYPICAL PRESENTATION OF TUBERCULOSIS Laura Torres Cruz, MD [1]; Mark Grijalva, DO [1]; Momina F Rahman, MD Hashem, MD [1]; Jonathan Torres Gonzalez, MD Lo, DO [1]; Aida Capo, MD [1] [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Hackensack Meridian Health -Palisades Medical Center, NJ Case Summary: A 59 -year-old male presented after being found to be hypotensive in the clinic. The patient also reports subjective fever, chills, and dry cough with associated weakness. He was previously seen in the emergency department (ED) two weeks prior for similar symptoms and was discharged with a course of azithr omycin and instructed to follow up outpatient. The patient states he was feeling better after the course of antibiotics until the next five days, when the same symptoms returned, which prompted him to come to the ED. On arrival, vital signs were unremarkab le. The chest CT showed left upper lobe pneumonia. QuantiFERON TB Gold test was positive, although all other tests, including the pneumonia panel, Nucleic Acid Amplification test (NAAT) for Mycobacteria tuberculosis (Mtb), AFB smear, and blood and induced sputum cultures, were negative. The patient continued to be febrile and tachycardic throughout the hospital course. However, his white blood cell count remained normal, and his only reported symptoms were fevers, chills, and dry cough. Echocardiogram was u nremarkable. Initial negative cultures and persistent fever despite medical therapy prompted bronchoscopy, demonstrating MRSA in one culture, although AFB smears were negative. The patient was treated with increasingly broad -spectrum antibiotics. As the pa tient's symptoms persisted and a repeated chest CT showed worsening multifocal left upper lobe pneumonia and new involvement of the right upper lobe, a second bronchoscopy was done. Endobronchial biopsy from the left upper lung showed non -necrotizing granu loma, which was negative for malignancy. Two weeks after admission, mycobacteria with fluorochrome smear cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) identified the Mtb. The patient was ultimately started on goal -directed medical therapy to treat Tuberculosi s (TB). Discussion/Conclusion: TB is known to be a great mimicker of what otherwise could be suspected to be a typical presentation of pneumonia in the presence of atypical radiological findings and endobronchial appearance. Mtb is a fastidious organism; thus, it can be challenging to culture via standard sputum collection. BAL has a 57% sensitivity to isolate Mtb. This patient presented with misleading chest CT findings consistent with possible community -acquired pneumonia alongside an initial negative NA AT for Mtb and multiple negative AFB smears in sputum and BAL specimens which led the medical team to pursue other etiologies of unresolving spiking fevers. Our case supports these findings by a biopsy of the left upper lung during bronchoscopy showing non -necrotizing granuloma and finally isolating the organism with the BAL. With this case report, we display a different presentation of pulmonary TB to aid clinicians in the earlier recognition of this phenomenon and contribute to the growing literature on bronchoscopy and BAL as an alternative way of diagnosing this disease when there is a high clinical suspicion. Abstract # 111 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 111 AN ATYPICAL PRESENTATION OF NEUROSYPHILIS Laura Torres Cruz, MD [1]; Mark DO F Rahman, MD [1]; Imran jot Singh Sekhon, MD [1]; Aida Capo, MD [1] [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Hackensack Meridian Health -Palisades Medical Center, NJ Case Summary: A 30 -year-old male with no significant past medical history presented with right facial and left upper extremity weakness and left occipital headache for three days. He reported associated mouth numbness, loss of taste sensation, and loss of sensation on the left side of the face. He admitted similar symptoms six months ago, which wer e resolved by themselves. He admitted sexual intercourse with another male in the last 12 months, although he denies any previous sexually transmitted diseases. On arrival, vital signs were unremarkable, and the physical exam was remarkable for left ptosis and facial droop, impaired sensation on the left side of the face, deviation of tongue and uvula to the left side, decreased strength in the left upper extremity, scaly rash around the face, oral thrush, mild neck stiffness, and negative Kernig's sign, and Brudzinski's sign. Laboratory findings reveal white blood cells of 4.6 and HIV -4th Generation and HIV1 antibody tests were positive, with a CD4 count of 136. Rapid Plasma Reagin titer was reactive with 1:64 as well as the fluorescent treponemal antibody. MRI brain showed multiple nonspecific subcortical and periventricular white matter foci. Additional tests for opportunistic infections were negative. Infectious disease and Neurology services were consulted. Ultimately, the patient was placed on guideline -directed medical therapy for Neurosyphilis and HIV with AIDS, and he was discharged to follow up at the HIV clinic and primary medical doctor. Discussion/Conclusion: Despite its relatively low prevalence among primary, secondary, and latent syphilis case s, the increasing rates of syphilis in the United States make it a relevant concern. Early recognition and treatment are crucial to prevent long -term complications. This case also underscores the importance of obtaining a thorough social and sexual history to identify potential risky behaviors for Neurosyphilis and HIV. Neurosyphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis and is classified as early or late. Early Neurosyphilis is seen in the first weeks to years of infection, as opposed to late Neurosyphilis, w hich presents years to decades after primary infection. Early Neurosyphilis consists of meningitis or meningovasculitis. It has been observed that a combination of untreated syphilis and HIV results in a predisposition toward early Neurosyphilis. Neurosyph ilis concomitant with HIV and AIDS could atypically present with ischemic stroke -like symptoms. We present a case of a young male who initially displayed neurological symptoms suspicious of a cerebrovascular accident that resulted in the new onset of Neuro syphilis simultaneous with HIV and AIDS. With this case report, we aim to emphasize the importance of having a low suspicion index for Neurosyphilis co -occurring with HIV and AIDS in any young patient with potential high -risk behaviors for these conditions who present with neurological symptoms worrisome for a cerebrovascular accident.

Laura Torres Cruz, MD [1], Momina F Rahman, MD Imranjot Singh of Internal Medicine, Hackensack Meridian Health -Palisades Medical Center, NJ Case Summary: A 31 -year-old male with a past medical history significant for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension presented with a two -week history of headache and blurry vision. He reported that he has not been taking his blood pressure medications for the past six months due to a lack of insurance and has been borrowing insulin from his bo ss. His vitals were remarkable blood pressure of 183/120 and heart rate of 102. The physical exam was unremarkable. Laboratory findings were notable for the new onset of acute kidney injury with creatine of 9.50 and blood urea nitrogen of 64. Troponins wer e elevated and then trended down. Electrocardiogram showed non -specific T wave changes and left ventricular hypertrophy confirmed with an echocardiogram, which also showed an ejection fraction of 65%, grade III diastolic dysfunction, and normal wall motion . MRI brain was unremarkable. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for the management of a hypertensive emergency. Cardiology recommended no additional intervention. After day one in the ICU, blood pressure was at the target goal for 2 4 hours. The 24 -hour urine protein analysis showed 8100 mg, consistent with nephrotic range proteinuria. The renal ultrasound showed a normal renal sonogram. Glomerulonephritis workup was negative, including C3, C4, - dsDNA, p -ANCA, -ANCA, and anti -glomerular basement membrane antibodies. HBV, HCV, HIV, and syphilis tests were negative. Subsequently, the patient's creatinine increased to 13.23 and BUN 105. CT -guided renal biopsy demonstrated advanced IgA nephropathy. Ultimately, the patient was started on guideline -directed medical therapy, and renal replacement therapy was initiated, given the progression of the renal disease and the not expecting it to improve. During the hospital course, his blood glucose ranged from 70 to 130, and hi s hemoglobin A1c was 4.9; thus, he never needed insulin administration or to be discharged on diabetic medications. Discussion/Conclusion: IgA nephropathy is a significant cause of kidney disease that can lead to progressive renal failure. While clinical presentation and laboratory findings can suggest IgA nephropathy, renal biopsy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis. Early identification and treatment of IgA nephropathy can delay or prevent the progression of renal damage, leading to better clinical outcomes. With this case report, we emphasize the importance of earlier diagnosis and treatment of IgA nephropathy to halt its progression to end -stage renal diseases, which will result in renal replacement therapy and, ultimately, a kidney trans plant. Additionally, this case reinforces the significance of continuous glucose monitoring in patients with diabetes, especially insulin -dependent and newly diagnosed end -stage renal disease, to assist in the adjustment of diabetic treatment; thus, preven ting episodes of spontaneous hypoglycemia that can lead to life -threatening complications.

His initial laboratory findings showed a hemoglobin (Hb) level of 3.3 g/dl with normocytic normochromic red blood cells (RBCs). The patient's absolute r eticulocyte count was 0.011 x 106/L, and the reticulocyte index was 0.08%. His baseline hemoglobin one year ago was 11 g/dl. The patient's workup was negative for opportunistic infections, and he had normal hemoglobin electrophoresis along with an unremar kable iron panel, vitamin B12, and folate levels. However, parvovirus B19 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was >100,000,000 with peripheral blood smear showing atypical lymphocytosis, RBC morphology, target cells cell distrib ution width of 15.3%, and CD4 count of 45 cells/mm3. Due to the patient's unwillingness, a bone marrow biopsy was not performed in our case. Provisionally, the patient was diagnosed with chronic parvovirus infection with pure red cell aplasia causing sever e anemia on initial admission and received IVIg of 2 g/kg. By the time of discharge, his blood counts responded, and his Hb was stable at 7.2 g/dL; however, he was found to have persistent viral titers of parvovirus B19. After discharge, the patient did no t follow up in the clinic. Unfortunately, the patient had a relapse about six months later and presented to the ER with a Hb of 4.8 g/dl and normocytic normochromic anemia with an absolute reticulocyte count of 0.060 x 106/L and reticulocyte index of 0.46 %. He underwent endoscopy with findings of plaques in the esophagus but no active bleeding ulcers, lesions, or evidence of carcinoma. After multiple blood transfusions, his hemoglobin stabilized at 9.3 g/dL, and he was subsequently discharged. Upon follow -up in two weeks, the hemoglobin dropped again to 6.7 g/dL. He was then treated with IVIg 1 g/kg x two days and since then has been requiring monthly maintenance IVIg of 0.4 g/kg for the last year. While on maintenance IVIg, he has not required breakthrough blood transfusions or hospitalizations. He reported improved adherence to his highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, with gradual improvement in CD4 counts and decreasing viral load. Conclusion: Patients with HIV are at the risk of develop ing persistent parvovirus infection leading to chronic anemia. The use of long -term maintenance IVIg provides a favorable therapeutic outcome. However, it is challenging to determine the optimal dose and duration of IVIg treatment for chronic parvovirus in fection to minimize relapses and recurring hospitalizations. We have been treating our patient for around one year with IVIg who had a good response, and we believe reporting our findings may aid in the management of similar cases. To define treatment guid elines further, prospective studies analyzing the effectiveness of chronic maintenance therapy should be conducted.

[1] Internal Medicine Resident at Palisades Medical Center, NJ. Introduction - Alistipes finegoldii is a gram -negative anaerobic bacter ium that is commonly found in the human gut microbiome. In this medical case report, we will present a case of a patient with bacteremia caused by Alistipes finegoldii that progressed to DIC. The purpose of this report is to increase awareness of Alistipes finegoldii as a potential pathogen and to contribute to the body of knowledge on the diagnosis and management of infections caused by this bacterium, particularly in cases of atypical presentation. Case presentation - This section presents a case of a 63 -year-old male with a medical history of diabetes and alcoholic liver cirrhosis who presented with altered mental status and rectal bleeding. The patient's initial vital signs showed a heart rate of 70 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 89/51. On phys ical exam, the patient had jaundice and an active gastrointestinal bleed. Laboratory evaluation was remarkable for hemoglobin 4.5 g/dL (normal 14 - 18 g/dL), mean corpuscular volume (normal 80 -94 uL (normal 150,000 - 400,000 uL), partial thromboplastin time 40.5 seconds (normal 24.5 - 37.6 seconds), prothrombin time 36.8 seconds (normal 9.5 - 12.8 seconds), INR 3.18, total bilirubin 4.9 mg/dL (normal 0.3 - 1.0 mg/dL), lactate 12.9 (normal <2.0). A CT angiogram of the revealed cirrhosis with hepatic lesions compatible with hepatomas, splenomegaly, portal hypertension with esophageal and gastric varices, and ascites. The patient required immediate ICU level care, with a central line placed for immediate transfusions to maintain hemodynamics and correct coagulopathies. Empiric antibiotics were started, and cultures were positive for Alistipes fingoldii, which was found to be pansensitive. Despite aggressive resuscitation efforts, the patient clinically deteriorated, w ith lab results showing disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The patient expired despite appropriate transfusions of fresh frozen plasma, packed red blood cells, and vitamin K. Discussion - This is the first documented case of Alistipes finegoldii that likely resulted in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) which resulted in mortality of the host. There are other cases of A. fingoldii bacteremia associated with malignancy in the literature 1, but none of the cases indicate DIC as an outcome. Thi s organism is beginning to emerge as an opportunistic organism. It remains that A. finegoldii should still be considered in those with acute pathology. Citations: 1.

[1] Internal Medicine Resident at Palisades Medical Center, NJ. Introduction - Syphilitic aortitis is a rare complication of late -stage syphilis that affects the aorta 1. It is characteri zed by inflammation, degeneration, and aneurysm formation in the aortic wall 2. Aortoesophageal fistula, a rare and potentially life -threatening complication of aortitis, occurs when a connection forms between the aorta and the esophagus 3. In this case re port, we present a patient with Syphilitic aortitis complicated by hemorrhage from aortoesophageal fistula, a rare and challenging manifestation of the disease 2. Case presentation - A 45 -year-old male with no prior medical history presented with two episo des of hematemesis. A chest x -ray revealed a possible aortic aneurysm, which was confirmed by a computed tomography angiography showing a 10 cm descending abdominal aortic aneurysm and a 6 cm thoracic aortic aneurysm with a possible aortoesophageal connect ion. Due to the extensive aneurysm involvement of the ascending aorta, there was suspicion of syphilis involvement which was confirmed with a VDRL positive dilution of 1:16 and positive rapid ascending aortic aneurysm resection, as cending aortic replacement, elephant trunk of the descending arch, and resuspension of the aortic valve, along with a left carotid subclavian artery bypass and ligation of the left subclavian artery proximal to the left vertebral artery was performed. Desp ite these interventions, the patient continued to experience massive hematemesis and went into cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation. Emergent TEVAR was performed with a successful aortogram adequate sealing of the aneurysm sac. However, subsequent attempts at esophageal stenting were unsuccessful, and the patient ultimately suffered from abdominal compartment syndrome, perforated esophagus, and tension pneumothorax, leading to cardiac arrest without successful resuscitation. A biopsy taken from the ascending aorta later revealed prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate on hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) stain consistent with syphilitic aortitis. Discussion - This case highlights the complex and potentially life -threatening nature of aortic aneurysms and the need for prompt and aggressive management. The occurrence of aortoesophageal fistula and perforated esophagus added to the patient's difficulty in this case and highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in the management of these patien ts.

Shraboni Dey MD, Young Hu DO, Ayrton Bangolo MD, Chinmay Trivedi MBBS; Adam Atoot MD Hackensack Meridian Health - Palisades Medical Center, North Bergen, NJ Learning objective: Raising awareness among the population with pre -existing latex allergy to prevent deadly anaphylaxis secondary to jackfruit ingestion due to established cross -reactivity Case Summary: A 68 -year-old female with a past medical history of hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and seasonal allergies presented with acute onset of shortness of breath, wheezing, tongue swelling, periorbital swelling, and extensive generalized itchiness 30 minutes after ingesting four pieces of jackfruit. The patient took Benadryl with no relief in symptoms. EMS was called, and IM epinephrine was administered. Upon arrival at the hospital, she was found to be hemodynamically stable. The physical examination revealed tongue swelling, periorbital edema, urticaria, and tachycardia. Routine labs and chest x -ray were unremarkable. During the interview, the patient reported seeing an allergist several years ago and endorsed having a confirmed allergy t o latex which resulted in a mild rash in the past. On the initial swallow evaluation, the patient was noted to have dysphagia. She was observed overnight in the hospital and received scheduled doses of methylprednisolone, diphenhydramine, and ipratropium/a lbuterol. Subsequently, the patient's dysphagia resolved, and she was noted to have no re -emergence of anaphylactic symptoms. Therefore, the patient was medically optimized and discharged with a tapered dose of prednisone, cetirizine, and epinephrine pen w ith follow -up at the primary care office and referral to an allergy specialist within a week. Conclusion: Artocarpus heterophyllus (jackfruit) is the national fruit of Bangladesh, native to several Eastern countries and South America, where it has been co nsumed for centuries. The recent interest in meatless superfoods within The United States has dramatically increased jackfruit's overall popularity. To the best of our knowledge, there have been two prior cases reported in the literature on jackfruit -induc ed anaphylaxis in patients with a known latex allergy. With the increase in latex glove use within the healthcare industry secondary to universal precautions set by OSHA, there was an observed specific and significant increase in fruit hypersensitivity in patients with latex allergies. The incidence of jackfruit consumption will only continue to rise in Eastern and Western countries. While the incidence of jackfruit anaphylaxis is relatively low, latex allergies are prevalent, especially among healthcare wo rkers. Not all individuals have 'latex fruit syndrome,' but educating susceptible individuals about the risks of cross -reactivity and anaphylaxis may still be prudent to prevent life -threatening anaphylactic shock.

Since then, there have been few cases documenting CTPV, and none in the setting of invasive pancreatic ductal carcinoma (IPDC). We present a case of a 66 -year-old male with a past medical history of asthma, por tal vein thrombosis (PVT), and recently diagnosed IPDC on active chemotherapy who presented with one week of worsening jaundice, pale stools, darkening of the urine, and severe nausea. His exam was significant for diffuse jaundice, no scleral icterus, and a benign abdomen. Initial laboratory results were significant for Hgb 9 g/dL, PLT 122 10*3 410 U/L, and total bilirubin 2.2 mg/dL with a direct of 1.6 mg/dL. Imaging significant for CT of the abdomen with intravenous contra st completed from an outside hospital one month prior which demonstrated a new splenic vein thrombosis, an extension of his previously known PVT, portal hypertension, and cavernous transformation of the portal vein (CTPV). On hospital day two, the patient completed an ERCP which revealed no biliary obstruction. On hospital day four, the patient was discharged. CTPV can develop as quickly as 6 - 20 days after PVT occurs and is the result of the formation of periportal, intra -thrombotic venous, and arterial cha nnels that form in response to resistance to flow (2). It usually occurs in non-cirrhotic livers and in non -tumoral PVT and has a wide range of clinical presentations from asymptomatic to findings consistent with portal hypertension such as esophageal vari ceal bleeding with pancytopenia due to hypersplenism (3). Rarely, it can present as a transient obstructive jaundice picture called \"pseudocholangiocarcionma sign\" (PSCS) which reflects a cholestatic liver injury pattern and specifically without scleral ic terus which corresponded with our patient's clinical presentation (3). There is no specific consensus on CTPV management as it is dependent on the etiology and clinical context, but CTPV itself is only curable through liver transplantation and even then th ere is difficulty in reconstructing the portal vein (4). In this case, ERCP stenting of biliary ductal strictures was not performed as none were present, and the decision to continue with medical therapy and have close follow -up outpatient with Oncology and GI was made. It was postulated that this patient developed PSCS, however, a cofounder of recent use of Tamiflu two weeks before his presentation can not be excluded for the cause of his symptoms and lab findings. CTPV is a unique and rare complication of portal vein thrombosis and should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in a new hepatic lesion or otherwise unexplained transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia in the correct clinical context.

Introduction: Foreign body aspiration is uncommon, yet can be life threatening when it occurs. While bronchoscopy is the gold standard of diagnosis and management of foreign body aspiration, it only accounts for 0.16 -0.33% of adult bronchoscopic procedures 1. Furthermore, the gold standard of foreign body extraction at this time remains rigid bronchoscopy, while flexible bronchoscopy is utilized increasingly more frequently2. To our literature review, the utilization of a flex ible disposable bronchoscope is rarely used even though it can provide rapid diagnostic and therapeutic utility. In this case we present a critically ill patient with extensive foreign body asphyxiation that was stabilized rapidly with a flexible disposabl e bronchoscope. Case: 44 year -old female with a past medical history of drug use presents after being found down by the side of a creek. Patient was intubated in the field and presented with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in process via automated act ive compression decompression CPR device (LUCAS). After achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in the emergency department, computerized tomography (CT) of the head was non -diagnostic, while the CT chest demonstrated clusters of radiodensities within the left lower lobe bronchi. Foreign bodies were also noted in the patient's airway and nose. A disposable fiber -optic bronchoscope was utilized for diagnostic purposes in the emergency room and discovered multiple pebbles/rocks that were removed fr om the superior segment, medial basal, and anterior sub-segmental of the left lower lobe bronchus, using simple forceps and baskets. Images are presented below: The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit on full mechanical ventilatory s upport. Discussion: Early bronchoscopy, with disposable instruments is readily available and should not be delayed in order to identify the cause of severe respiratory failure, even in the emergency room. A disposable fiberoptic bronchoscope is the quicke st way to inspect the patient's airways even in the emergency room. Attempting to remove foreign bodies is essential in resuscitation efforts, may be life saving, and can be attempted with simple instruments such as forceps and baskets, as in this case. Abstract # 119 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 119 CASE REPORT: PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS LEADING TO SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME Arjun Patel, BS [1] Uri Hochfeld, MD [1] Kevin Kim, MS [1] MD [1] Deep Patadia, [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Hackensa ck University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA INTRODUCTION : Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world and typically manifests with fever, weight loss, night sweats, and cough. Pulmonary TB is a rare etiology of ac ute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is a case of a previously healthy 65 year -old male with pulmonary tuberculosis that led to ARDS. This case illustrates the importance of considering TB as a potential ARDS etiology due to its fatal implication s and differing management. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65 year -old male with no medical history from Bangladesh presented with three weeks of productive cough, fatigue, night sweats, and mild respiratory distress one month after visiting New Jersey. At the time of admission the patient tested negative for b acterial and viral pneumonia, and serum laboratory studies including comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood counts were unremarkable. Chest radiograph (CXR) on admission was notable for a right upper lobe consolidation (Figure 1) and two days aft er admission the patient was confirmed positive for tuberculosis by sputum sample PCR. He was consequentially initiated on anti -mycobacterial consisting of Rifampin, Isoniazid, vitamin B6, Pyramazimade and Ethambutol (RIPE). Three days after admi ssion the patient developed worsening respiratory failure requiring intubation. At that time, CXR showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates consistent with ARDS (Figure 1). ARDS was managed with ARDS Clinical Network Mechanical Ventilation Protocol (ARDSnet), p roning, RIPE therapy and vasopressors for septic shock. Unfortunately the patient expired 18 -days after presentation. DISCUSSION: Although pulmonary TB is an uncommon etiology of ARDS, it is important to monitor these patients for the development of ARDS clinical features. Our patient developed severe ARDS one day after RIPE initiation and one month after symptom onset. In our case, the patient was unresponsive to RIPE therapy, ARDSnet mechanical ventilation, and proning. The pathophysiology of ARDS second ary to pulmonary TB is not well understood. Our patient's rapid deterioration one day following RIPE initiation whilst clinically stable for a month prior to admission is concerning for a unique pathophysiology of ARDS requiring further research. One possi ble mechanism is an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome following initiation of RIPE therapy. CONCLUSION: Management of acute pulmonary TB should include therapeutic considerations to prevent progression to ARDS. Given our patient's deterioration on RIPE therapy and ARDS lung protective ventilation and proning, it is prudent to perform further research on management of this patient population to prevent progression to ARDS.

[2] Department of Oncology, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA. Introduction: Type B lactic acidosis (LA) is a complication of hematologic malignancies and is considered an oncological emergency associated with high mortality and poor outcomes if not diagnosed and treated promptly. We present a case of refractory type B LA with multiorgan failure as the initial presentation of di ffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Case: A 65 -year-old male presented with fatigue and shortness of breath for one week. On admission, he had a blood pressure of 145/72 mmHg, pulse rate of 109 beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, and oxygen sa turation of 95% on room air. Initial blood work revealed hypoglycemia (glucose 43 mg/dL), acute kidney injury (creatinine 1.9 mg/dL), and gap 27, lactate 14 mmol/L, and pH 7.17). He was initiated on br oad-spectrum antibiotics and admitted to the intensive care unit for emergent hemodialysis (HD). Despite two days of continuous HD, his LA persisted, and he developed worsening respiratory failure requiring intubation. Blood cultures, fungal markers, lymph oma, and leukemia flow cytometry remained negative. Empiric thiamine was initiated to facilitate LA clearance. On day 3, blood smear revealed atypical large cells with folded nuclei and agranular cytoplasm suggestive of an underlying hematologic malignancy . High -dose steroids were initiated, and he underwent a bone marrow biopsy. In the following days, he developed refractory shock and expired. Two days postmortem, bone marrow biopsy results revealed CD5+ large B -cell lymphoma, confirmed on autopsy. Discus sion: Severe, refractory hypoglycemia and LA in patients without apparent tissue hypoxia should raise suspicion for occult malignancy. Refractory type B LA with multiorgan failure may be the initial presentation of a hematologic malignancy; thus, a high in dex of suspicion is required to obtain an adequate tissue sample and initiate treatment. Treatment has not been fully established, but early chemotherapy is the best chance for survival. Intravenous thiamine, sodium bicarbonate, and renal replacement thera py are temporizing efforts to slow the progression to multiorgan dysfunction and respiratory muscle fatigue. Given the nearly definitive fatality in patients without prompt antineoplastic intervention, it may be reasonable to consider each patient's risk a nd benefit from empiric initiation of antineoplastic agents while awaiting definitive diagnosis. Conclusion: Persistent LA without identifiable causes of tissue hypoxia should prompt clinicians to consider alternative etiologies, including high -grade occu lt malignancies. Prompt diagnosis is essential as early antineoplastic intervention may improve survival. We encourage a multidisciplinary discussion of the risks and benefits of initiating antineoplastic agents prior to diagnostic confirmation in cases wi th high suspicion for a new diagnosis of hematologic malignancies in patients with multiorgan failure and refractory LA.

It was associated with intermittent pain in the abdomen in the epigastrium and right hypochondrium. Back then, he tolerated chemotherapy well except for minimum side effects(nausea, stomatitis, and bilateral paresthesias in both feet ). However, his nausea and reflux persisted, and no other precipitating factors. On physical exam, mild epigastric tenderness was noted. His USG Abdomen showed a slightly thick -walled stomach. He underwent barium meal swallow, which was suggestive of partial obstruction in the C loop of the duodenum in the post -bulbar part, dilated stomach, duodenal bulb, and slow emptying. PET CT showed mild FDG uptake seen in the 2nd and 3rd part of the duodenum persists in later images suggesting inflammation. An Upper G I endoscopy showed tight stricture at the junction of D1 and D2, which didn't allow the passing of the dilating balloon. He underwent gastrojejunal anastomosis. He recovered pretty well without complications. Discussion Duodenal strictures occur likely fro m peptic ulcer disease, caustic injury, infections, pancreatitis, malignancies, and localized radiation therapy. Though mucositis secondary to systemic chemotherapy might occur anywhere throughout the gastrointestinal tract, our patient had late -onset duod enal stricture after chemotherapy developed over two years compared to previously reported cases. While the FOLFOX regimen (Folinic acid, 5FU & Oxaliplatin) is a comparatively safer alternative, our patient developed stricture likely from repeated mucosal insults leading to fibrosis and stricture. It has been studied that 5 -FU causes decreased cellularity and increased apoptosis, leading to villous atrophy and predisposing the mucous membrane to ulceration and damage. Diagnosis is made by upper endoscopy, C T abdomen, or Barium meal study. In duodenal strictures, fluoroscopic guided balloon dilation with stent placement or gastrojejunostomy with dietary modifications is the mainstay of treatment.

Traditionally, rigid bronchoscopy has been used therapeut ically to remove the cast. One case has also reported a patient who self -expectorated the cast. We present a unique case where a flexible bronchoscope was utilized at bedside to extract and reconstruct a massive hemorrhagic tracheobronchial cast obstructin g the patient's airway completely, leading to resolution of the patient's acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Case Presentation: The patient is a thirty -six-year-old male with extensive medical history including schizophrenia, right lower extremity gangren e status -post amputation as a sequelae of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and recurrent urinary tract infections secondary to a chronic foley catheter, who presented with a chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient's hospital course was complicat ed by a left upper lobe cavitation leading to hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to massive hemoptysis, several episodes of cardiac arrest, and eventual embolization by interventional radiology as well as recurrent pleural effusions managed with several chest tubes. The patient achieved Return of Spontaneous Circulation after receiving 1 mg of epinephrine and three minutes of Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in one of these cardiac arrests. He was then found to be awake, with preserved circulation, however, continued to have massive hemoptysis, approximately 700cc of bloody output was noted in the suction canister. The patient was difficult to ventilate with a bag -valve mask through the tracheostomy. An emergent bronchoscopy demonstrated a massive clot obstr ucting the airway completely. Given it was refractory to suction, the decision was made to intubate orally to secure the airway. The tracheostomy tube was removed, and bronchoscopy was performed with a size 5.8 bronchoscope. A (hemorrhagic) cast was remove d in pieces comprising the entire tracheobronchial tree, as shown. Following the bronchoscopy, the patient's stoma site was evaluated with no active bleeding, nor an obvious fistula was seen. We then introduced a new 7 distal long shiley tracheostomy tube under bronchoscopic guidance followed by bronchoscopic confirmation of correct position and attachment to the ventilator. The patient did well and was eventually discharged to rehabilitation center after decannulation. Discussion/ Conclusion: A cast of th e tracheobronchial tree, either spontaneously expectorated, or extracted via rigid bronchoscopy, has been reported in the past. The unique aspect of this case is that the cast was removed in pieces via disposable flexible bronchoscopy at bedside and recons tructed.

She underwent root canal involving the use of hypoc hlorite solution for intraprocedural disinfection. She subsequently developed left facial droop particularly near the mouth, and complained of numbness and tingling of the left cheek as well as \"clogging sensation\" in her left ear. The patient's symptoms p ersisted and ultimately underwent electrodiagnostic study of her face. Upon physical exam, there was significant left facial droop primarily around the lips. The forehead appeared unremarkable and the patient was able to close her eyes. Sensation was norma l and symmetric throughout the face. Direct stimulation of the left and right facial nerves were normal. EMG of the left orbicularis oris revealed decreased recruitment, whereas the frontalis, nasalis, mentalis, and orbicularis oculi were normal. The patie nt was ultimately diagnosed with an incomplete isolated neuropathy of the buccal branch of the left facial nerve. Discussion: Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is an irrigant that is commonly used as a disinfectant and debris dissolvant during dental procedures because of its high pH. However, extravasation of NaOCl can cause potentially devastating damage to nearby tissues. Commonly reported examples range from simple erythema and edema of the nearby superficial skin to intraoral ulcers and mucosal necrosis. Ho wever, cranial nerve injury is rarely seen given their deeper location in relation to dental procedures. Conclusion: Facial nerve palsy is a rare but potential adverse event of hypochlorite toxicity during dental procedures.

He described moderate sharp pain at the right groin radiating to the test icle as well as testicular phantom pain which was exacerbated by simple activities such as walking and laying prone. Examination was notable for tenderness along the right groin with pain upon resisted hip flexion. He was diagnosed with inguinal neuralgia with testicular phantom pain. Pelvic floor physical therapy for 12 weeks yielded moderate yet transient relief. He tried gabapentin without improvement, and amitriptyline caused significant adverse effects. Our objective was to alleviate this pain using interventional modalities. The patient underwent sequential right ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerve blocks with ultrasound, as well as right pudendal nerve block under fluoroscopy. Each of these procedures resulted in complete pain relie f but only temporarily for about 5 days. The ultimate method used was dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) which was placed at the right L1 and S2 levels (Figs 1,2) given that sensory innervation of the groin, testes, and scrotum arise from these nerve roots. This resulted in total pain relief for the past 5 months and continues to be efficacious. We conclude that DRGS of L1 and S2 can be an effective intervention to relieve persistent groin and testicular pain with the advantage of providing long term r elief compared to several other interventions.

She also reported pain in her hair follicles when touched. She presented to the ER and was found with stiff, tender neck musculature with severely limited range of motion due to pain. The right mastoid was tender to palpation and Tinel test caused radiation of her usual pain over the right scalp. MRI cervical spine revealed mild C4 -C5 and C5 -C6 central canal narrowing without cord compression. Gabapentin, amitriptyline, baclofen, and hydromorphone were started for presumed occipital neuralgia without significant improvement. 4 days later, she developed painful vesicular rash over the right scalp, philtr um, and inside the nostrils and started on IV acyclovir with subsequent rapid improvement of scalp and neck pain with restoration of neck range of motion. She was diagnosed with shingles and discharged home with oral acyclovir. Discussion: Occipital neuralgia is regarded as a common condition. However, studies show lifetime prevalence of 1.2 -1.6 percent indicating overdiagnosis. The differential for neck and referred head pain is broad including C2 -3 facet arthropathy, paracervical muscular spasms or trigger points, meningitis, tumor, and more. This patient had multiple risk factors and clinical findings consistent with occipital neuralgia including female gender, allodynia, unilateral neuropathic pain from the occiput radiating over the sca lp, and relatively unremarkable imaging. However, her pain was likely due to shingles as evidenced by development of vesicular rash in the corresponding distribution with rapid improvement of symptoms following antiviral treatment. Conclusion: Shingles ca n mimic occipital neuralgia and therefore should be on the differential when evaluating neck and posterior head pain.

She developed weakness and worsening myalgias of neck and proximal upper and lower extremities resulting in significant functional impairments. Nearly 2 years later, she was being considered for cervical spine surgery due to progressively worsening symptoms. Subsequent work up showed an elevated CK level at 904 U/L and EMG findings were consistent with myopathy. Inflammatory myopathy autoantibody testing was negative. Muscle biopsy revealed scattered necrotic fibers. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with the autoantibody -negative (seronegative) necrotizing myopathy. She received intra venous immune globulin (IVIG) with improvement of distal bilateral upper and lower extremity strength without improvement in the proximal muscles. She was admitted to acute inpatient rehabilitation where she improved from requiring maximal assistance to cl ose supervision for ambulation and transfers. Immune -mediated myopathy (IMNM) is rare subtype of inflammatory myopathy characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness, markedly elevated CK, myopathic EMG findings, and muscle biopsy demonstrating necrotic fibers. IMNM is divided by autoantibody and autoantibody -negative unique correlates. Anti -HMGCR myopathy is closely linked to statin use. Anti -SRP myopathy patients tend to be younger with severe weakness and extra -muscular features such as heart and lung involvement. Seronegative IMNM remains poorly described in literature but is associated with increased risk of malignancy. While musc le biopsy can be avoided in anti -HMGCR and anti -SRP myopathies with positive autoantibody testing in the setting of proximal muscle weakness and elevated CK levels, early muscle biopsy is recommended for seronegative IMNM diagnosis. Conclusion: Seronegative IMNM is a rare subtype of inflammatory myopathy. Early diagnosis and prompt multidisciplinary intervention are imperative for disease progression prevention and functional recovery.

Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine 123 Metro Blvd, Nutley, NJ 0 7110 Case Summary: Patient was a mid -70 year old female with a past medical history of hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) presented with complaints of severe epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain started after having her lu nch the day prior and at night time, she started to experience vomiting. On arrival, the patient's vitals were: blood pressure 148/96 mmHg, heart rate 98 bpm, temperature 98F, respiratory rate 18, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Physical exam was only significant for tenderness in the epigastric region with diffuse tympanic hyperresonant throughout. Significant lab values were: white blood cell count 12.8 x 109/L (normal range: 4.5 -11.0 x 109/L), blood urea nitrogen 14 mg/dL (normal range: 7 -20 mg /dL), (CT) with contrast revealed a large paraesophageal hernia with marked gastric distention and fluid retention, suggestive of gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) (Image 1). Patient was managed conservatively with intravenous (IV) fluids and nasogastric tube placement for decompression. Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) series revealed large paraesophageal hernia with organo -axial gastric volvulus (Image 2). During her hospita l stay, she successfully underwent a robot -assisted hiatal hernia repair with anterior 180 degree fundoplication. Her postoperative course was unremarkable and the patient was discharged after a day of observation. Discussion/Conclusion: Hiatal hernias ar e a common condition, especially in individuals over the age of 50, affecting up to 60% of the population. Larger hiatal hernias can lead to complications, ranging from GERD to gastric volvulus and incarceration of the bowels. Gastric volvulus is a severe complication and is commonly linked with other conditions such as hiatal hernias or adhesions. Its symptoms are known as Borchardt's triad, consisting of nonproductive vomiting, severe epigastric pain, and difficulty inserting a nasogastric tube. A case is presented where a large hiatal hernia resulted in gastric volvulus leading to gastric outlet obstruction in an elderly patient with a history of GERD. Modern surgical treatment of hiatal hernias can be done laparoscopically with robotic assistance, result ing in comparable outcomes to non -robotic surgeries but with increased ease and dexterity for the surgeon. The patient was successfully treated with a robot -assisted Nissen fundoplication, which not only reduced the remaining volvulus but also aided in red ucing her GERD symptoms. In patients with history of hiatal hernia and abdominal symptoms it is important to consider gastric volvulus as a differential and to be prepared for prompt medical and surgical treatment.

Department of Endocrinology, Jersey Shore Universit y Medical Center, 1945 NJ -33, Neptune City, NJ 07753 Case Summary: This is a mid -30 year old patient diagnosed with fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma and who underwent partial hepatic resection in 2021. After 18 months of no follow - up, repeat imaging revealed recurrence of hepatic lesions. The patient was started on nivolumab and received a total of three cycles. Seven days after the third cycle of nivolumab, he developed fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, and weight loss that worsened over two weeks. Physical exam was significant for diffuse abdominal pain on deep palpation and hepatomegaly. Labs revealed a blood glucose concentration of 319 mg/dL (n=74 -106 mg/dL), pH of glutamic acid decarboxylase -65 (GAD -65) antibodies and a C -peptide lev el of 0.7 (n=0.8 -3.9 ng/mL), suggesting a diagnosis of autoimmune diabetes secondary to nivolumab use. He was treated with intravenous (IV) insulin and aggressive hydration with successful resolution of DKA. Following discharge, the patient became reliant on exogenous injection of insulin. Discussion : Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death receptor -1 (PD-1), programmed -1 ligand -lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA -4) have proven to be effect ive in end -stage tumors with distant metastasis (1). However, ICIs can cause various adverse effects, including T1DM, with an incidence of 0.6 - 1.4%. The mechanism of ICI -T1DM is believed to be the rapid destruction of B -cells by T -cells (2). Most patients with ICI -T1DM present with severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), requiring critical care. However, some cases have an insidious onset, with high HbA1c levels. Frequent monitoring and follow -up can detect ICI -T1DM before it reaches the fulminant state. Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), another form of autoimmune diabetes, was also considered for a mid -30 year old patient who met two out of three criteria but was insulin - dependent immediately after the onset of DKA, more consistent with ICI -T1DM (3). Autoantibody testing may not always be positive in ICI -T1DM, and the diagnosis is based on factors such as recent ICI use, acute DKA presentation, low C -peptide levels, and the immediate requirement for exogenous insulin. As ICIs use expands, clinicians s hould be aware of autoimmune adverse effects, including T1DM and counsel patients accordingly. Screening should be developed for those most susceptible to irAEs.

Department of Medicine, Jersey Shore University Medical Center 1945 NJ-33, Neptune City, NJ 07753 2. Saint George's University, School of Medicine, West Indies, Grenada Case Summary: An 81 -year-old woman with a history of moderate aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease presented with exertional dyspnea and multiple episodes of melanotic stools over the past day. Upon arrival, her vital signs were heart rate 75, blood pressure 144/66 mmHg, respiratory rate 19 with oxygen saturation of 98% on room air, and temperature 37.3C. A soft S2 was heard at the second right inte rcostal space during the physical exam. Her labs showed elevated prothrombin (PT) of 14.5 seconds (s) (normal range: 11 -13.5s), hemoglobin of 12.6 g/dL (normal range: 12.1 -15.1 g/dL), blood urea nitrogen of 38 (normal range: 7 -20 mg/dL), and creatinine -1.1 mg/dL). patient's rivaroxaban was discontinued, and she was given intravenous (IV) fluids, started on IV pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily, and admitted to the telemetry floor. Over the initial 12 hours of admission, the patien t continued to experience multiple episodes of loosely formed melanotic stools, and her hemoglobin dropped to 9.6 g/dL. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed, which revealed two large diverticula, 15mm and 20mm, in the second position of the du odenum with hematin material (Figures 1a, 1b). Washing out the hematin revealed an oozing arteriovenous malformation (AVM), which was treated with argon plasma coagulation (APC) (Figures 2a, 2b). Her hemoglobin remained stable afterward, and the patient wa s discharged to her home. She was instructed to restart rivaroxaban four days after the procedure. Discussion/Conclusion: Duodenal diverticula are commonly seen in upper endoscopicI studies, with a prevalence of 15 -22% (1). Most are asymptomatic, but comp lications such as diverticulitis, obstruction, perforation, and GI bleeding have been reported (2). Upper GI bleeding caused by duodenal diverticulum AVMs (ddAVMs) is exceedingly rare, with only five reported cases to date (Table 1). A case of an 81 -year-old female with a significant ddAVM - cause GI bleed is described, which was successfully treated by identifying and cauterizing the ddAVM using APC. The average age of patients with ddAVMs is 52 years, with a 3:2 female -to- male ratio. Symptoms include melena , syncope, lightheadedness, weakness, and shortness of breath. The locations of ddAVMs vary, with the fourth part of the duodenum being the most common origin. Management varies case to case, with successful hemostasis achieved using surgical and different cauterization methods. A literature review shows that both APC with thermal coagulation and HPC are effective in managing bleeding ddAVMs (Table 1). The majority of duodenal diverticula are benign and asymptomatic. Nonetheless, it is important to consider ddAVMs as a source of upper GI bleed. When considering the technical difficulties in identifying a small bowel bleed, it is imperative not to miss this as a potential source to avoid multiple endoscopic attempts.

CT head with IV contrast showed a 3. 5 cm cerebellar mass with near -total obstruction of the 4th ventricle and a right upper lobe mass measuring 3.6 cm. He underwent a craniotomy and resection of a solitary cerebellar lesion. Biopsy revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, markers consi stent with pulmonary primary malignancy. He was ultimately diagnosed with Stage IVB (cT2a, cN2, pM1c) lung adenocarcinoma. He was then treated with two cycles of paclitaxel + carboplatin every 3 weeks and switched to nivolumab 360mg every 3 weeks + ipilimu mab (1 mg/kg) every 6 weeks. 4 months after his initial presentation the patient presented with seizure -like activity and altered mental status. It was initially thought to be leptomeningeal disease given his initial CNS metastasis. He improved on a steroi d taper. Ultimately, his brain MRI was found to be without any evidence of metastatic or leptomeningeal disease. Immunotherapies was restarted 2 months after this event. He had a similar event 4 months later when he presented to the ED with fatigue, weakne ss, and altered mental status. He was AOx1 (person) with 3/5 bilateral lower extremity weakness. MRI brain showed widespread perivascular enhancement. Lumbar puncture cytology and infectious work up was unrevealing except pleomorphic lymphocytosis. Given t he rapid presentation of symptoms he warranted a steroid challenge. He had minimal improvement after 4 days with methylprednisolone 2mg/kg. He was switched to pulse dose steroids and IVIG with gradual improvement over 4 weeks and then tapered off steroids over 6 weeks. His subsequent CT scans showed continued response with a significant decrease in size of his right suprahilar lymph nodes and right upper lobe mass. His subsequent MRI brain showed no evidence of metastatic or leptomeningeal disease and had c omplete resolution of his perivascular enhancement. Discussion: Rechallenging with immunotherapy resulted in recurrence of encephalitis, which was swiftly treated with a steroid taper. This striking pattern of perivascular enhancement is more consistent with encephalitis rather than leptomeningeal disease. This can cl inically help distinguish between immunotherapy toxicity from leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Since then, the patient has remained off any oncologic treatment for over a year and has no evidence of metastatic disease or encephalitis. MRI imaging, lumbar pun cture results and clinical signs are crucial to distinguish between immune related encephalitis and leptomeningeal enhancement. MRI findings of perivascular enhancement is an uncommon but when present, key distinguishing feature between leptomeningeal meta stasis and immune related encephalitis.

Yousafzai, MD [1]; Stacey Damito, DO [1]; Haroon Cardiology, HUMC Introduction: The prothrombin 20210 genetic mutation results in the second most commonly inherited clotting disorder in the world and is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in young patien ts. It is characterized by a single nucleotide translational mutation in prothrombin, or factor II, resulting in hypercoagulability. Aspiration thrombectomy (Penumbra Indigo CAT RX) has become increasingly recognized for its success in cases of neurovasc ular, peripheral vascular, and now coronary arterial thrombotic occlusions. The procedure features sustained mechanical aspiration which has improved both intraprocedural efficacy and reduced embolic risk; thus currently indicated for patients with acute h igh thrombus burden characterized by fresh and soft thromboembolism. Clinical Case: 31 -year-old male with no significant medical history who presented with atypical chest pain. On exam, the patient was obese and normal heart sounds were heard. Electrocardi ogram with sinus rhythm with ST elevations in lateral leads. Cardiac catheterization showed 100% occlusion of the left circumflex artery with a heavy clot thrombus burden. Patient underwent mechanical thrombectomy with Penumbra Indigo CAT RX. Post thromb ectomy there was no evidence of ruptured plaque or atherosclerotic disease. Hypercoagulable workup was positive for Prothrombin 20210 mutation. Patient was started on oral anticoagulation. Discussion: A gain -of-function mutation like prothrombin 20210 is presumed to amplify risk of thrombosis; however data on whether that risk conferred to risk of MI is mixed and unclear. A clinical suspicion needs to be raised as this syndrome may remain unrecognized in young patients presenting with MI who have no acquir ed risk factors. Genetic testing may be necessary. These patients are at an elevated risk of forming a high clot burden during an episode of acute thrombosis. Procedures like sustained aspiration thrombectomy would be profoundly therapeutic and beneficial. Results from the CHEETAH -ACS study recently revealed that the Indigo CAT RX device met primary and secondary endpoints of 30 -day freedom from major adverse cardiac events (96.7%) and rates of TIMI 3 flow at final angiography (97.5%), respectively. Large r population studies are needed to validate findings and pathogenesis of genetics predisposing patients to cardiovascular risk and mortality.

Current guidelines recommend PFO closure in eligible patients with cryptogenic stroke after exclusion of other causes. There is a high incidence of new onset atrial fib rillation (AF) after PFO closure. Case: A 44 year old male with a history of hypertension, diabetes and recent paradoxical embolic stroke was found to have a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Patient presented for an elective PFO closure. He underwent successfu l placement of a 30 mm Amplatzer Septal Occluder device with no residual leak noted on echocardiography. Post procedure, the patient went into new onset AF with rapid ventricular rate. Decision -making The patient was given intravenous metoprolol with subse quent conversion to normal sinus rhythm. Newly placed septal occluders can irritate the atrium, cause local inflammatory response, and act as an electrical barrier precipitating AF. Post PFO closure AF is mostly transient with a peak incidence of onset at 10-14 days and resolution within 6 -8 weeks. The patient was discharged home on a novel oral anticoagulant and an event monitor. While incidence of stroke with AF after PFO closure is low, the duration of anticoagulation is uncertain. Event monitoring for f urther AF is useful but the evidence for the duration of monitoring and the timing of stopping anticoagulation is limited. These factors make AF management after PFO closure challenging. Conclusion: Post-procedural AF is frequently transient with low risk of progression to persistent AF. The reported incidence of stroke in new onset AF post PFO closure is 0.1%. AF occurring within 45 days of PFO closure is considered transient and short term anticoagulation is proposed. However, duration of monitoring and timing of stopping the anticoagulation is unclear. Future research can be performed utilizing long term diagnostics like implantable loop recorder or novel wearables to determine the true prevalence and burden of post -closure AF to guide patients subjected to anticoagulation as a result of post PFO closure AF.

Although PE usually presents with the typical respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms, patients can present seizures as well due to transient cerebral hypoxia. Case Summary: An 80 -year-old female with past medical history of Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, pre -diabetes, CVA, and recent COVID -19 infection presented with a new onset of 2 episodes of generalized tonic -clonic s eizures. She had no history of preceding head trauma, alcohol use, or other illicit drug use. On presentation, there were no meningeal signs but the presence of unilateral lower extremity pain and erythema on the physical exam were noted. Labs were unremar kable except for an anion gap of 17, lactate of 8.7, and CK level of 31, likely secondary to lactic acidosis from the seizures. Urine drug screen was negative. The CT head did not demonstrate any acute findings which could explain the new onset of seizures . D-dimer was 6,914. Due to the unilateral lower extremity findings, elevated D -dimers, and new onset seizures with no apparent cause, CT chest PE protocol was obtained, revealing bilateral pulmonary emboli. Transthoracic Echocardiogram revealed some evide nce of right heart strain with minimal dilation of right ventricle and borderline reduction in right ventricular systolic function. Appropriate antiseizure medications were administered. EEG revealed no ongoing seizure -like activity. For the submissive PE, heparin thromboembolic nomogram was started. A multidisciplinary evaluation with cardiology, pulmonary and vascular surgery was obtained. The patient continued to improve with conservative medical management, transitioned to oral warfarin and discharged a fter medical optimization with outpatient follow -up. Conclusion: Although this patient had a submassive PE, she had no typical signs or symptoms of PE on presentation. The work -up for new onset seizures does not traditionally consist of ruling out PE as one of the causes. Due to this, there could be a higher chance of missing or delay in the diagnosis of a life threatening PE, which can be associated with high fatality rates. Prior literature has reported many cases of PE initially presenting with seizures and subsequent postmortem findings denoting PE, suggesting a del ay in diagnosis which could be catastrophic. PE should be a 'never -miss' differential diagnosis in an unexplained new -onset seizure. This will help in the avoidance of treatment delays and decrease poor patient outcomes.

Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Department o f Medicine, 1945 NJ -33, Neptune City, NJ 07753. 2. Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine 123 Metro Blvd, Nutley, NJ 07110 Case Summary: An mid -80 year old female with a history of hypothyroidism presents with right -sided chest pain and cough. The day bef ore her presentation she suddenly developed a severe bout of dry cough that lasted for 20 minutes. She then developed right -sided chest pain that lasted for 2 -3 hours before it self -resolved. The following night, she woke up with the same right -sided chest pain and cough. This time, the pain and cough persisted for a few hours warranting her to visit the emergency department. On presentation, she was afebrile,tachycardic,tachypneic and normotensive. She had a non -palpable right sided chest pain and no abdom inal pain. Labs showed WBC of 25.4 mm\u00b3 0.1 -1.0), bilirubin of 3.6 mg/dL (ref. 0.0 -0.3), alkaline phosphatase U/L -100), AST of 361 U/L (ref. 12 -38) and ALT of 201 U/L (ref. 10 -40). Acute causes of chest pain were ruled out. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed common bile duct dilation of 2.9cm (Figure 1). She was diagnosed with acute c holangitis with positive blood cultures of Klebsiella variicola. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), revealed two large stones in the lower one -third of the CBD, the largest measuring 20 mm (Figure 2). One stone was successfully removed, and a plastic stent was placed. The patient was prescribed ursodiol and was scheduled for a repeat ERCP after 8 weeks. Discussion/Conclusion: The classic presentation of acute cholangitis is Charcot's triad pain, jaundice, and fever) or Reynold's pe ntad (Charcot's triad plus altered mental status and hypotension). The sensitivity of Charcot's triad is reported to be as low as 7% to 26% (2). It becomes less reliable in elderly patients, aged greater than 80, who predominantly present with symptoms of malaise and altered mental status (3). In this case report, an elderly female presented with a sudden onset of cough and right -sided chest pain and the patient eventually was diagnosed with acute cholangitis. Cough is a rare symptom of biliary tree patholo gy as it can irritate cough receptors in the diaphragm mediated by prostaglandin E, histamine and bradykinin (4). Severe bouts of cough in our patient probably led to pleurisy, which manifested as chest pain. It is very important that clinicians are aware of the atypical presentations of acute cholangitis, especially in elderly patients, as they can be life -threatening if there is a delay in the diagnosis or the interventions.

The patient had no prior acute coronary events and did not compla in of chest pain. Upon arrival in the ED, she was found to be hypotensive (86/69 mmHg) and in acute distress, fluid resuscitation was provided. Her initial EKG revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes, unchanged from prior EKGs one mont h prior (figure 1). Despite adequate fluid resuscitation, the patient's blood pressure failed to improve, norepinephrine continuous infusion was initiated and the intensive care unit (ICU) was consulted. Repeat EKG during ED encounter revealed a new onset RBBB (figure 2). Laboratory values revealed troponin I level of 0.07 nanograms/liter (ng/L) (normal troponin I reference range <0.05 natriuretic peptide (BNP) of (normal BNP reference range <100 pg/mL). Lact ic acid was also elevated at 4.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) (normal lactic acid reference range 0.5 - 2.0 mmol/L). Shortly after ICU encounter, the patient went into cardiac arrest and advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) protocol was activated. The patient underwent two rounds of ACLS with return of spontaneous circulation. Repeat EKG showed a STEMI in leads II, III and aVF (figure 3). At that time, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) protocol was initiated and the transfer center was contacted for eme rgent catheterization. When the transfer team arrived, the patient again became pulseless. Despite continued ACLS intervention, the patient did not regain pulses and was pronounced deceased. Discussion/Conclusion: Despite recent advancements in management , acute myocardial infarction continues to be the most deadly manifestation of coronary artery disease. Early detection and immediate reperfusion therapy improves outcomes, but is not always possible when patients present atypically and without classic EKG findings. We presented an unusual case of inferior STEMI in a patient presenting with syncope, without reported chest pain, and with findings of new -onset RBBB on EKG, who may have survived had her impending STEMI been detected early. As with LBBB, RBBB s hould be recognized as a sign of underlying STEMI, in the appropriate setting, requiring emergent reperfusion therapy; as supported by the European Society of Cardiology 2018 guidelines for management of STEMI. With this case report, we aim to encourage cl inicians to include STEMI in the differential diagnosis of patients with new RBBB, with typical or atypical ACS presentation.

Risk factors include advanced maternal age, African descent, socioeconomic difficulties, obstetric complications, and other maternal morbidities that compromise the cardiovascular system such as diabetes and pre -eclampsia. We present a case o f maternal cardiac arrest in the setting of an emergency cesarean section in a patient with several risk factors including preeclampsia with severe features and uncontrolled type I diabetes. A review of relevant literature is included. Case Description: A 31-year-old G2P1001 at 32 weeks and 1 day of pregnancy presented with recurrent severe range blood pressures, proteinuria, and uncontrolled Type I diabetes. On hospital day 2, the patient was diagnosed with worsening preeclampsia with severe features, and the decision was made to deliver the patient via repeat low transverse cesarean section (RLTCS). Whilst undergoing surgery, the patient became agitated despite sedation and desaturated to 89% on room air. The patient was intubated and asystole was noted, immediately. Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) was noted after approximately 30 minutes of advanced cardiac life support (ACLS). Bedside echocardiogram was significant for an ejection fraction of 25 -30%, requiring insertion of an Impella device and the use of vasopressors. This patient's condition was most likely exacerbated by her morbidities: preeclampsia with severe features and uncontrolled diabetic disease. Discussion: Preeclampsia with severe features and diabetes can be considered as independ ent risk factors for maternal cardiac arrest. Diabetes has a reputation for increasing the risk of heart disease, and may therefore, warrant screening echocardiography in pregnant patients. Screening echocardiography as well as surgical optimization should be promoted in high -risk patients.

Physical exam revealed scler al icterus and diffusely tender abdomen with a positive fluid wave sign. Laboratory workup revealed white blood count 18.2 x 103/mL (N: 4.5 to 11.0 x 103/uL), platelets 174,000/mL (N: to 450 x 103/uL), total (N: 0.88 to 1.15). P olymerase chain reaction testing was positive for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19). Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed abdominal ascites with varices. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen showed left lobe hepatomegaly with thrombo sis of the intrahepatic portion of inferior vena cava, hepatic veins, and left portal vein. The patient was admitted for a fulminant presentation of Budd -Chiari Syndrome (BCS) and portal vein thrombosis (PVT). Therapeutic and diagnostic paracentesis reveal ed a transudative outcome, and treatment with enoxaparin sodium was initiated. Complications from hepatic encephalopathy were managed with lactulose. Ultimately, the patient was transitioned to warfarin therapy and discharged. Outpatient follow -up was nega tive for all causes of liver dysfunction and hypercoagulability. The patient was diagnosed with BCS and PVT secondary to COVID -19 infection. Clinical course consisted of repeated admissions for decompensated liver cirrhosis. Follow up MRI of the abdomen sh owed persistent BCS with new liver nodules, consistent with chronic BCS -induced cirrhosis. The patient is currently being evaluated for liver transplantation. Discussion: BCS is a rare condition characterized by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow anywh ere along the venous course. It is estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 people worldwide. COVID -19 can induce a hypercoagulable state due to its extensive inflammatory response leading to coagulation abnormalities. While COVID -19 has been reported to cause PVT , it rarely causes BCS. This case presents both PVT and BCS during the acute -phase of COVID -19 infection leading to chronic BCS and cirrhosis. While liver biopsy reveals hepatic congestion, centrilobular fibrosis and hepatocyte loss consistent with BCS; th ere is a disconnect between clinical presentation and histological features as approximately half of acute BCS patients show evidence of chronic damage and fibrosis. Therefore, biopsy alone is not a reliable indicator of BCS duration. Furthermore, while an ticoagulation is mostly successful in management of BCS, our patient had a complicated course despite treatment. We emphasize consideration of liver transplant for fulminant presentations superimposed with evidence of chronic damage and failed improvement.

[1] Department of Internal Medicine Residency, Palisades Medical Center, NJ. Introduction - Infective endocarditis is a life -threatening condition that can result in serious complications, including endocarditis -associated glomerulonephritis (EAG)1. EAG is a rare form of glomerulonephritis that occurs in patients with infective endocarditis and is characterized by inflammation of the glomeruli, leading to progressive kidney damage and failure2. This case report describes a rare and interesting case of EAG in a patient with infective endocarditis. Case presentation - We present a case of a 41 -year-old male with past medical history of IV heroin use, hepatitis C, and recent vegetectomy after endocarditis and septic emboli presented with nausea and vomiting. The patient was admitted to the hospital 18 days prior to admission with infective endocardit is, blood cultures were positive for Methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus and a vegetation of 2.1 x 2.6 cm was attached to the tricuspid valve. Patient received IV Oxacillin for 12 days, underwent vacuum vegetectomy of the tricuspid valve and then l eft the hospital against medical advice. He returned 5 days later, with 4 episodes of non -bloody, non - bilious vomiting. On initial presentation, he was hemodynamically stable, but ill -appearing with a systolic murmur at left sternal border. A petechial ras h was noted on his bilateral lower extremities, unchanged from prior admission. Laboratory values included creatinine of 2.15 mg/dL (normal 0.70 -1.30 mg/dL) increased from a baseline of 0.8 mg/dL, urinalysis containing many RBCs and 30 mg/dL of protein (no rmal 0 protein), urine protein/creatinine 1.6 grams (normal 0 grams). Patient admitted for acute kidney injury of unknown source. Renal ultrasound showed increased echogenicity, consistent with medical renal disease. Since the kidney function was worsening , including an increase in creatinine to 3.74 mg/dL, nephrology was consulted. Antinuclear antibody, anti -neutrophil cytoplasmic glomerular basement membrane antibody, electrophoresis, and serum immunofixation were negative. Complem ent levels were normal and HCV viral load was undetectable. Patient underwent kidney biopsy which revealed focal necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis with mild mesangial proliferative features and minimal immunofluorescence positivity associated w ith endocarditis. Discussion - Despite being a rare condition, the patient's presentation highlights the importance of prompt and appropriate management of infective endocarditis and its complications, including EAG1. This case also underscores the need fo r a high degree of clinical suspicion and a multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with infective endocarditis and its complications2.

A RARE PRESENTATION OF LIPOID PNEUMONIA Stacy Lee, MD [ 1]; Annie Nasir, MD Abraham Lo, DO [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Palisades Medical Center, NJ A 78 y.o. male with a past medical history signi ficant for throat CA s/p TORS radical tonsillectomy/selective neck dissection and peg placement due to recurrent history of aspiration presented to ED with hemoptysis, fever/chills for a few days prior to the presentation. On physical exam, vitals were wit hin normal limits. The patent was hemodynamically stable, appeared cachetic and sputum with bright blood was noted. Hemoglobin was stable and no leukocytosis. All chemistry labs were within normal limits. Procalcitonin was negative. CT chest showed left lo wer lobe consolidation with areas of fat attenuation versus cavitary lesion (Figure 1 and 2) which was read as highly suspicious lipoid pneumonia. Given the patient's extensive smoking history and recent significant weight loss, bronchoscopy was performed. Biopsy was negative for malignancy. Patient also had a recurrent history of aspiration pneumonia in the past with swallowing evaluation showing silent aspiration. The patient had been using the PEG for his nutrition feeds, but he usually takes all his med ications PO. Cod liver oil is one of the PO medications. Upon further investigation, the patient reported taking a liquid form of Cod liver oil by mouth every day as a dietary supplement. Lipoid pneumonia was clinically diagnosed. Patient was advised to di scontinue oil supplements and subsequently discharged home. Lipoid pneumonia is an uncommon lung disease caused by inhalation or aspirating lipid -containing products which leads to an inflammatory reaction. Lipoid pneumonia is usually caused by aspiration of lipid containing agents such as vegetable oils, mineral oils and fish oils like in our patient, or inhalation of nasal applicants rich in lipids. Most patients can be asymptomatic or experience recurring chronic cough with sputum production and dyspnea. Less frequent are weight loss, chills and hemoptysis as in our patient. Chest radiographs and chest CT scans reveal alveolar consolidation, ground glass opacities, and alveolar nodules in bilateral lower lung regions as defining characteristics. However, imaging results can mimic malignancy given opacities can appear poorly defined and mass like, as in our patient's case. Lipoid pneumonia is managed by preventing exposure to the oil source and no additional treatment is necessary. In our case, a patient wi th risk of aspiration ingested fish oil for one year and presented with hemoptysis and chills which are rare symptoms for lipoid pneumonia. Our objective is to make the medical community aware that hemoptysis and chills can be the only presenting symptoms of lipoid pneumonia which can mimic malignancy and that it has the potential to yield radiological findings comparable to those of lung malignancies. Moreover, we aim to raise awareness of lipoid pneumonia in geriatric population who are exposed to any for m of over -the-counter oil supplements.

The patient was afebrile on presentation with blood pressure 112/58 mmHg, heart rate 106/min, and saturating well on room air. On abdominal exam, there was tenderness in the lower quadrants with guardi ng and dull resonance diffusely. Labs and pelvis with contrast initially showed large stool throughout the colon and no acute colonic pathology. The patient was started on Piperacillin/Tazobactam and admitted for sepsis of unknown origin. A day after admission, the patient noted a popping sensation in the right lower quadrant with stabbing pain radiating to the right clavicle. Physical exam revealed a diffusely distended abdomen with positive rebound tenderness, guarding, and tympanic resonance. CT angiogram of abdomen and pelvis was consistent with pneumoperitoneum with localized inflammation and perforation of the sigmoid colon. The patient underwent emergency laparotomy and left colectomy with sigmoid colectomy following perforation the rectosigmoid colon with fecalomas protruding through the perforation and the entire length of the left colon. Intra -abdominal cultures were taken during the procedure which grew polymicrobial microorganisms which produced ESBL. The patient completed a course of ertapenem before being discharged. Stercoral ulcer perforation (SUP) is a rare but serious complication of chronic constipation described in less than 150 cases worldwide as of 2018. SUP occurs due to fecal impaction leading to pressure necrosis of the colonic mucosa, resulting in ulcer formation. Chronic constipation is the single greatest risk factor for formation of stercoral ulcer formation, present in 81% of all patients, likely due to chronic opioid dependence in our patient case. The subsequent perforation of these ulcers can result in fecal peritonitis, sepsis, and can be fatal in 30 -60% of cases without prompt recognition and surgical intervention. Our patient presented with atypical signs of SUP, with our case being e scalated based on her change of symptoms. In our literature review, there have been no cases reported with SUP that did not have radiographic evidence, especially CT Abdomen, of colonic inflammation or fecal impaction. Here, we report a rare case of sterco ral perforation without radiographic studies showing stercoral colitis, ulcer, or fecal impaction. This is the first case report with a negative CT abdomen in a patient with SUP with diagnosis made intra -operatively.

Here we present a patient with advanced Mycobacterium chimaera infection without typical r isk factors. Discussion A 58 -year-old male presented to the emergency department on July 30th, 2019, complaining of cough with yellow sputum, left upper abdominal pain, and worsening fatigue over the last three weeks. He also noted a 20 -pound weight loss o ver the previous two months. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension, and intravenous drug use (IVDU). The patient admitted injecting heroin almost daily, worked as an electrician and lived alone. He first sought medi cal attention for his symptoms on May 24th, 2019, when he came to the emergency room complaining of sinus congestion and dyspnea on minimal exertion for one week. At baseline, he could walk one flight of stairs without shortness of breath. He endorsed appe tite but denied lower extremity edema, orthopnea, fever, or chills. He was in mild respiratory distress with wheezing and decreased breath sounds at the lung bases on physical examination. On exam, he was afebrile, tachycardic, with a heart rate of 109 bea ts per minute (bpm), pulse oximetry of 87% on room air, and BMI of 18.5. The emergency physician initially read his chest x -ray as a left upper lobe infiltrate, and he was started on treatment for pneumonia with ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and ipratropium - albuterol nebulizer. The radiologist later the x -ray as a left upper lobe interstitial and alveolar process that may be chronic in etiology. The patient was called back to the emergency room due to positive blood cultures of Candida parapsilosis . A computed tomography (CT) upper lobe extensive bullous emphysema and bronchiectasis with significant volume loss in the left hemithorax, which was suggestive of a chronic process. Given history of COPD and IV drug use, ther e was suspicion of tuberculosis. While testing was in progress, he was started on fluconazole for candidemia. Endocarditis was ruled out by both a transthoracic as well as by trans -esophageal echocardiogram. Subsequent HIV test, the QuantiFERON\u00ae -TB Gold te st were negative. However, acid -fast bacilli cultures came back positive. Conclusion: We presented a patient who developed advanced pulmonary Mycobacterium chimaera infection without typical risk factors of the prior cardiac bypass procedure. Instead, his past medical history was significant for COPD and IV drug use. The therapeutic regimen involves clarithromycin or azithromycin and rifampin with ethambutol for a prolonged period, often for at least 12 months. Mycobacterium chimaera infections should be c onsidered in patients with a history of COPD. The association with IV drug use is a potential area for future study.

Patient noted experiencing severe sore throat and myalgias four days prior to presentation. On the day of pre sentation, he was awakened at 5 am by chest tightness, that was 4/10 in severity, and radiated to the back, and did not alleviate with albuterol nebulization. In the ED, he appeared stable without any acute distress. Patient's temperature was 100.5 F; he w as hypotensive to 83/55 mmHg with a HR of 90 - 100/min. SpO2 was 100% on room air. Labs were remarkable for a troponin of 7 that continually trended up to 9 and 17.30 on serial measurements every 4 hours. CRP was 221, and leukocytosis to 15K was also noted. EKG showed minor ST elevations involving the inferior leads. STAT ECHO showed a normal EF without any wall motion abnormalities. Due to the unremitting nature of his chest discomfort in conjunction with a significant rise in repeat troponin to 18.23, a decision was made to transfer the patient to a higher facility for urgent cardiac catheterization. Coronary angiography did not reveal any stenotic lesions and an outpatient cardiac MRI was advised. Patient re -visited the ED for chest pain about a month post -discharge. Patient could not undergo a cMRI study due to insurance constraints. EKG at that time showed new T -wave inversions in the precordium that were likely evolutionary. Troponin and ESR were negative, but C-reactive protein was still elevated, althou gh to a lesser extent. Patient received supported care that resulted in symptomatic relief, and was advised to avoid exercise, alcohol consumption, NSAID use, and follow -up with a cardiologist in 3 months at the time of discharge. Myocarditis refers to inf lammation of the cardiac muscles due to various etiologies that could either be infectious or noninfectious. Patients can be asymptomatic, but can present with cardiac symptoms such as chest pain and shortness of breath as seen in our case. A definitive di agnosis of myocarditis is made by an endomyocardial biopsy, however, to avoid invasive diagnostic testing, most physicians utilize a combination of EKG, echocardiogram, and cardiac MRI to reach this diagnosis. To avoid unnecessary invasive testing, it is c rucial to gather a thorough patient history, including all plausible risk factors for a cardiac event, and most importantly questioning about a recent viral illness, especially in younger patients. Viral myocarditis should always be considered one of the d ifferential diagnoses in patients presenting with ACS -like features with a low probability for coronary artery disease, with or without a recent history of upper respiratory tract symptoms, as the latter could be subtle. Abstract # 144 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 144 A CASE REPORT OF CARDIAC FAILURE IN A PATIENT ON TEDUGLUTIDE FOR HIGH OUTPUT Medical Center 4 -community Medical Center , Toms River 5 -St Claire's Hospital A high volume of ileostomy output in patients with extensive bowel resection can be hard to manage. This leads to extensive loss of fluids and electrolytes along with malabsorption. Medications have traditionally controlled it by delaying intesti nal transit and decreasing intestinal and gastric secretion using opiates, loperamide, diphenoxylate, omeprazole, somatostatin, and octreotide. However, many patients depend on parenteral nutrition and fluid and electrolyte infusions, even with optimal dru g therapy. Despite the best possible care, they may develop renal failure. Teduglutide is a GLP -2 analog given as a daily subcutaneous injection, and it has been promising in managing short bowel syndrome. It has been effective in decreasing the dependence on parenteral nutrition. However, improving fluid and electrolyte balance can precipitate cardiac failure in some patients, especially those with borderline cardiac functions, hypertension, and thyroid disorders. This usually presents in the first few mon ths of the initiation of teduglutide therapy and may require stopping the medication. We present the case report of an elderly female with high output stoma on parenteral nutrition on teduglutide. There was a significant decrease in stoma output, and paren teral nutritional support could be stopped. However, she presented with worsening dyspnea and was diagnosed with cardiac failure with an ejection fraction of 16 -20 %. The baseline ejection fraction was 45%, done six months before this. Coronary angiography showed no stenosis in any vessels, and the decline in left ventricular ejection fraction and fluid overload was attributed to teduglutide therapy.

It works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by interacting with the ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) . It is a safe antibiotic if used for a short duration in an uncomplicated host. Here, we present a case of a 66 - year-old female with extensive orthopedic history who developed a prosthetic knee infection resistant to other antibiotics. With that in mind, she was treated with a prolonged course of linezolid therapy and developed lactic acidosis despite having normal liver and kidney function. A 66 -year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of hypertension osteoarthritis with a very complicated ort hopedic history presented to our facility in February 2022. In January 2021, the patient underwent an open reduction internal fixation of the left knee. The patient experienced complications of her prosthetic knee, which was removed in April 2021. Intraope rative cultures and wound cultures grew Mycobacterium abscessus and Candida albicans, respectively. The tigecycline, clarithromycin, and linezolid until August 2021. In October 2021, a patient was admitted to the hospital for increasing left knee pain and drainage. The orthopedic team saw the patient, the antibiotic spacer was removed, and a new one was inserted. Intraoperative cultures again grew Mycobacterium abscessus. The patient was started on oral linezo lid, clarithromycin, and IV amikacin to treat Mycobacterium abscessus isolate. On February 2nd, 2022, the patient presented to Riverview Medical Center because of an episode of vomiting. The patient was fully vaccinated against COVID -19 infection. On admis sion, the patient was found to be COVID -19 positive without symptoms. On admission, her blood pressure was 156/72 mmHg temperature 98.7 F, heart rate 90 bpm, respiration 18 bpm, and SPO2 98% on room air. She was found to have lactic acid of 4.9. A computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast and a chest x -ray showed no abnormalities. The patient did not have any symptoms suggestive of ongoing infection and was not septic. Linezolid was discontinued on day 1. Her lactic acid post disconti nuation of linezolid and combination with IV fluids improved to 1.6 on day 2 Discussion/Conclusion: Linezolid induced lactic acidosis is multifactorial in etiology. However, the patients diagnosed with lactic acidosis have been treated with a prolonged co urse of linezolid therapy in the setting of liver and or renal dysfunction. Although our patient did not have pre - existing comorbidities, the duration of treatment played a significant role in the patient developing lactic acidosis. Therefore, it is essent ial to be aware of linezolid -induced lactic acidosis in patients without hepatorenal dysfunction, mainly if the patient requires a prolonged course of therapy.

Department of Gastroenterology, Hackensac k Meridian Health, Palisades Medical Center, North Bergen, NJ, USA Learning Objective: 1) Being cognizant about a novel subtype of cancer in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) - 'Adeno -Endocrine tumor' 2) The importance of frequent surveillance colonoscopie s in IBD and maintaining a lower threshold to biopsy any suspicious lesion Case Summary: A 58 -year-old male with a past medical history of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) presented with worsening abdominal and rectal pain. He had a sigmoidoscopy 4 days prior to t he presentation during which a rectosigmoid stricture was biopsied. His vital signs were noted to be relatively stable. The general physical exam demonstrated dry mucous membranes, sinus tachycardia, and abdominal tenderness with no signs of peritonitis. E SR and CRP were elevated at 25 and 28.5, respectively and the other routine labs were unremarkable. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed diffuse pancolitis and a focal narrowing of the rectosigmoid junction with irregular wall thickening suspicious f or a stricture. MRI of the abdomen revealed minimal wall thickening and edema in the visualized colon which reflected UC with no bowel obstruction. The biopsy from the rectosigmoid stricture denoted poorly differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm, WHO grade 3/3 with probable mixed large and small cells of GI origin. The subsequent rectal EUS/colonoscopy revealed severe diffuse pancolitis with a circumferential 5cm T3N1 sigmoid mass with high -grade sigmoid obstruction and scattered malignant appearing 5 -10 mm lymph nodes. The biopsy from the mass denoted mixed adenocarcinoma and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma. The patient then underwent total colectomy with end ileostomy which intra -operatively denoted sigmoid cancer with peritoneal metastasis a nd UC. The final operative specimen pathology denoted \"Invasive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with mucinous and neuroendocrine differentiation arising from severely active inflammatory pancolitis with focal low -grade dysplasia\". The patient was subsequently medically optimized and discharged with outpatient Oncology follow -up. Conclusion: This case reinforces the importance of more frequent surveillance colonoscopies in the IBD population. Also, gastroenterologists should also be cognizant that IBD -related colonic neoplasia does not always present with the classic endoscopic findings associated with sporadic colorectal cancers, and closer inspection of the colon, biopsies for any suspicious lesions, and random targeted biopsies should be performed. F urthermore, as more cases of a novel subtype of 'Adeno -Endocrine' tumors are being reported in IBD, larger studies, predominantly at a molecular level are needed to better understand the pathogenesis.

She was an unreliable historian at the time of the initial encounter due to acute alteration in mental status post-fall. Her vital signs included a temperature of 36.7C (98.1F), with a heart rate of 77/min, blood pressure of 138/61 mmHg, respiratory rate of 20/min, and SpO2 of 98% on room air. On musculoskeletal exam, she had 3 out of 5 strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities, and her spine was midline without tenderness to palpation and sensation was intact in all her extremities. CT facial bones revealed slightly laterally displaced left nasal bone fracture, probable fracture of the nasal spine of the m axilla. Her urine drug toxicology screen was positive for amphetamines, and benzodiazepines. Additionally, during medication reconciliation it was noted that she was on multiple psychotropic medications including, opiates, benzodiazepines, hypnotic agents, and CNS stimulants. The following day, she had worsening weakness and loss of sensation in upper extremities. An MRI was then done which revealed congenital canal stenosis with signs of myelomalacia. Neurosurgery was consulted who performed cervical lamin ectomy of the C3 to C6 spinal levels. However, the patient did not fully regain sensation, but showed mild improvement. One of the modifiable risks for fall injuries is polypharmacy, generally defined as use of four or more prescriptions medications daily. More importantly, certain medications are known to increase risk for falls include sedatives, neuroleptics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and opioids. In one study, older adults with polypharmacy with fall risk increasing drugs had alm ost 50% higher fall injury risk than those with polypharmacy without fall risk increasing drugs. Our patient developed worsening of sensation on day 2 of the hospitalization which prompted MRI which revealed myelomalacia, a rare complication of trauma. Mye lomalacia is a condition in which the spinal cord softens due to lack of blood supply due to an acute injury/trauma. Because late stages of myelomalacia can result in irreversible loss of function, it is important to recognize early signs of myelomalacia f or early intervention. Hence, it is crucial to recognize early signs of myelomalacia in fall trauma patients with MRI. The case emphasizes the significant relationship between polypharmacy and fall risk. CPS is an essential tool to triage these patients to ensure proper treatment in a timely manner. We also emphasize performing a thorough neurological exam in fall trauma patients to recognize early signs of myelomalacia, hence early intervention can avoid irreversible loss of function in these patients.

He has a history of atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, cardiomyopathy secondary to wild -type transthyretin amyloidosis, chronic kidney disease stage 3b secondary to cardiorenal syndrome, and pulmonary the patient's home torsemide dose was cut in half secondary to chronic hypotension. The patient presented with a temperature of 97.7 F, a blood pressure of 92/56, a pulse of 56, and SpO2 of 94% on room air. On exam, the patient had 2+ pitting edema bilaterally with clear lungs. Initial CBC showed a white count of 4.7, hemoglobin of 8.8, and platelets of 187. C MP showed a sodium of 118, chloride of 78, potassium of 3.0, BUN of 98, creatinine of 2.32, and glucose of 107. BNP was 1750. Troponin was 0.14. Given the patient's history, clinical presentation and laboratory work, it was determined that the patient had an exacerbation of his cardiomyopathy, creating a fluid overloaded state leading to his bilateral lower extremity edema. His fluid overload state and diuretic use were also initially believed to be the causes for his severe hyponatremia. Diuretics were hel d, potassium was repleted, and a dose of tolvaptan 15 mg was given to create an aquaretic effect to improve his hyponatremia of 118. Repeat sodium the next morning was 119. Because the patient was still edematous and thus clinically hypervolemic, a 2 mg do se of bumetanide was administered and he was also put on a fluid restriction of 1 L for his hyponatremia. Repeat sodium later that day increased marginally to 120. Given the risk of possible complications, hypertonic saline was run for three hours overnigh t at a rate of 50 mL/hr. The next morning, the patient still remained hyponatremic at 124. His edema, however, was greatly improved and he was no longer short of breath. Further interventions to improve his sodium over the next few days included further fl uid restriction to 1.2 L, three additional doses of tolvaptan 15 mg, and additional administration of hypertonic saline at 40 mL/hr over 4 hours. Even after these interventions, the patient's serum sodium did not go above 128 during this admission. Further analysis showed that the patient's serum osmolality at this time was normal at 298mOsm/kg, suggesting that the patient had normal serum sodium, and that the laboratory readings were falsely low. Hyponatremia poses a great risk for respiratory depression a nd seizures which is the reason for its urgency for correction. This risk of mortality is greater with a sodium of less than 120 (1). However, given the laboratory methods used to measure serum sodium, the recorded reading may not accurately reflect the tr ue serum sodium concentration, especially in conditions that displace serum water, such as hype Abstract # 149 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 149 THE SILENT CULPRIT: VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY LEADING TO RHABDOMYOLYSIS IN A CIRRHOTIC James MD [1]. [1] Department of Internal Medicine, Palisades Medical Center, NJ. Learning Objectives: 1. Rhabdomyolysis can occur spontaneously in patients with liver cirrhosis. 2. Low vitamin D levels are a risk factor for developing rhabdomyolysis. 3. Supplementation of vitamin D can reduce CK levels and improve symptoms in fluid resistant rhabdomyolysis. Case Summary: A 67 -year-old-male with a past medical of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatopulmonary syn drome admitted due to 3 days of generalized muscle pain, fatigue, and inability to walk. On admission, laboratory values included a creatinine kinase (CK) level of 12,000 transaminase (ALT) U/L (normal 7 -52 U/L). His home medication atorvastatin 10 mg was held, and the patient was started on aggressive IV fluids for the management of rhabdomyolysis. Initial CK level decreased to 8,000 but then began to in crease to 9,000 even after continued IV fluid resuscitation. Other laboratory workup including infectious and autoimmune causes were negative. The patient was then transferred to his liver transplant facility for further evaluation. He was found to have 25 - hydroxyvitamin D <3.4 ng/ml and given 50,000 units of ergocalciferol. He was not given further IV fluids for concern of fluid overload. His symptoms started to improve, and his strength returned. The patient's CK level completely normalized with the sole treatment of vitamin D supplementation. Discussion: Serum CK level of more than five times the upper limit of normal is diagnostic for rhabdomyolysis, which can result from traumatic, nontraumatic, or medical injury of skeletal muscle cells with or withou t characteristic sign symptoms or myoglobinuria1. Severe vitamin D deficiency increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, especially in patients taking statins, usually after strenuous physical exertion2. Thus far, to the best of our knowledge, ther e have only been two prior cases reported in the literature on vitamin D deficiency leading to myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, and one case study was reported on polymyositis and rhabdomyolysis related to hepatocellular carcinoma1. This is the first case repo rt of developing rhabdomyolysis in the setting of severe vitamin deficiency, which was resistant to fluid resuscitation and then corrected after supplementing with vitamin D. It is prudent to follow up the vitamin D level in the patient presenting with Rha bdomyolysis and more studies need to be done to find an association between Rhabdomyolysis and vitamin D deficiency.

The patient experienced subjective fevers and progressively worsening pharyngitis that began four days prior to admission. The symptoms did not improve with rest and home remedies, thus she sought medical care. On admission, the patient was normotensive but was tachy cardic, tachypneic, and had a pulse oximetry of 89% on room air. Biochemistry revealed thrombocytopenia angiogram of the chest revealed multiple bilateral pulmonary masses of varying sizes in the lower lung fields with central cavitation. Blood cultures grew fusobacterium necrophorum in multiple vials and the antibiotics were adjusted from vancomycin and piperacillin -tazobactam t o metronidazole and ampicillin -sulbactam. The patient underwent video assisted thoracic surgery with complete dissection of a fibrinous exudate with pockets of fluid. Visual examination had revealed the presence of nodules, likely septic emboli, but were n ot engaged. Lemierre Syndrome is a rare disease that is very responsive to antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention when warranted. It occurs more often in young adults with a median age of 18 -20 years and a 2:1 male predisposition. Anecdotal reports i n the early 2000s suggested that the incidence of Lemierre Syndrome may be on the rise due to pushes for strict antimicrobial stewardship and fewer prescriptions of antibiotics for uncomplicated upper respiratory infections. Most upper respiratory infectio ns remain contained within the pulmonary circuit but rarely can be characterized by hematogenous invasion. Anaerobic oropharyngeal infections account for less than 5% of all anaerobic bacteremias. The most common culprit is an anaerobic, filamentous, gram negative non -spore forming bacilli known as fusobacterium necrophorum. Early recognition is critical as the disease can have a rapidly progressive and often fatal course. A high degree of suspicion in addition to employment of proper imaging modalities can identify individuals sooner. Unfortunately, early in the disease course, the only symptom may include high fevers as well as oropharyngeal soreness and pain. F. necrophorum is an anaerobic pathogen that can take up to 8 days to grow on cultures thus contr ibuting to a significant delay in definitive diagnosis and under treatment. Antibiotic stewardship is an important practice in daily medicine. However, in the cases of infection with a potent and rapidly aggressive pathogen, early antibiotic treatment is c rucial to prevent morbidity and mortality. Our report is a stark reminder that infection with Fusobacterium necrophorum is now more prevalent in modern practice. A high suspicion, awareness, and early antibiotic administration will lead favorable patient o utcomes with minimal long term complications.

The patient denied any fevers, dyspnea, fatigue, or bleeding. Family history was unremarkable for hemato -oncologic conditions. During his follow up appointment, he was noted to have severe asymptomatic pancytopenia with neutr openia. He was subsequently given a dose of Zarxio which elevated his ANC from 500 to 1100. Physical examination revealed mild splenomegaly 4 cm below the left costal margin. Due to clinical and laboratory abnormalities the patient was referred for bone ma rrow biopsy. The biopsy was consistent with Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) with BRAF positivity. The patient was started on cladribine and rituximab shortly after diagnosis. During chemotherapy induction the patient experienced a fever and thrombocytopenia requ iring transfusion and admission. The patient was found to be positive for parainfluenza 3 and cladribine infusions were continued during his hospital stay. He was recommended to follow up with his hematologist and primary care physician. Discussion: HCL i s a rare and indolent B cell leukemia that has a predilection for elderly Caucasian males and is responsible for 2 -3% of adult leukemia. Due to neoplastic infiltration of the bone marrow and spleen, patient's commonly present with splenomegaly, pancytopeni a, B- symptoms (such as fevers and night sweats), and susceptibility to infection. Diagnosis of HCL is based on clinical, genetic, and histopathological confirmation. BRAF V600E mutations are found in the majority of HCL's. Treatment is multimodal, varied, and can include targeted molecular therapy or chemoimmunotherapy. Commonly employed agents include cladribine, pentostatin, rituximab, vemurafenib and trametinib. Herein we described an incidentally discovered case of HCL and emphasize the importance of HC L. It is prudent for family medicine physicians to recognize this disease entity. Patients may present with nonspecific constitutional symptoms mimicking a post -viral syndrome due to increased risk of viral infections and laboratory abnormalities such as p ancytopenia. HCL, unlike other hematological malignancies, does not commonly present with lymphadenopathy. Additionally, HCL can rarely involve the cutaneous, musculoskeletal, hepatic, and nervous system. Our patient's clue to diagnosis was his profound pa ncytopenia. Pancytopenia is protean and can be incited by many conditions such as infection, drugs, autoimmune disease, and malignancy, therefore it is important to thoroughly investigate and identify a cause of pancytopenia for each patient. HCL demonstra tes a survival rate >90% after 5 years. Treatment response is robust and dependent on clinical presentation. Asymptomatic patients may undergo a watch and wait approach, whereas those demonstrating symptoms can be treated with chemotherapy and immunotherap y.

[1] Department of Internal Medicine, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ [2] Structural and Congenital Heart Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ [3] Depar tment of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ Case Summary: A 75 year -old female with chronic diastolic heart failure, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on warfarin and prior mitral valve repair for severe mitral regur gitation presented for elective transcatheter mitral valve replacement. She had a recent hospitalization for decompensated heart failure exacerbation and underwent right heart catheterization which revealed severe mitral regurgitation. She was ultimately d ischarged on intravenous Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) mitral regurgitation and tethering of the anterior leaflet with restricted motion without paravalvular leak. A balloon tipped catheter wire was guided across the mitral valve, advanced into the aorta and snared to create a rail. A tip to base laceration of the anterior mitral leaflet to prevent outflow obstruction (LAMPOON) of the A2 segment was performed using TEE guidance and CT fusion followed with t he deployment of a 29 mm Edwards Sapien S3 post -dilated with mild residual paravalvular leak along the lateral aspect. Additionally, an iatrogenic atrial septal defect (ASD) was successfully closed using Amplatzer septal occluder device with no evid ence of systemic venous obstruction or residual leak. Discussion: Neo-left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is an established complication of transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) due to the proximity of the LVOT and anter ior mitral valve leaflet. Predictable factors include an obtuse aortomitral angle, left ventricular size and septal wall thickness. Alternative techniques such as transatrial leaflet resection and alcohol septal ablation have limitations including the requ irement of a cardiopulmonary bypass and risk of myocardium damage, respectively. The LAMPOON technique entails splitting of the anterior mitral valve leaflet using radiofrequency via catheters. It has been shown to yield a LVOT gradient <30 mm Hg in 97% pa tients with risk of LVOT obstruction that underwent TMVR with 93% survival to discharge in the LAMPOON IDE study. Iterations of this technique and clinical studies are ongoing to yield further outcomes of this technique. We describe a successful case of TM VR post LAMPOON to prevent neo -LVOT obstruction.

The patient was first found to have S. mitis IE and peri -aortic valvular abscess in 2018 while actively using IV heroin. At that time he underwent biologic AVR with irrigation and plication of the AV abscess with eventual resolution. In 2020, he suffered a nearly identical recurrence, at which multiple vegetations were found on both the prosthetic aortic and native mitral valves. He underwent re -do AVR (27 mm Inspiris), primary repair of mitral annular abscesses, and mitral valve vegectomy. In both encounters, he was treated with 6 weeks of penicillin and ceftriaxone. On this admission, the patient was febrile to 100.6F. Initial labs showed a normal white blood cell c ount, elevated sedimentation rate of 74 mm/h, and elevated C -reactive protein of 18.6 mg/dl. Urine drug screen was positive only for cannabinoids. However, blood culture was again positive for S. mitis growth. Repeat transesophageal echocardiogram revealed a periaortic abscess between the aortic root computed tomography revealed a hypoattenuating leaflet thickening of the prosthetic AV, which was likely due to perivalvular thrombus or pannus. The patient was started on ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and rifampin for empiric treatment of IE. Given that the patient had abstained from intravenous drug use (IVDU), etiology of his bacteremia needed clarification. Unfortunately, workup for causes including a formal dental exam and CT of facial bones was unrevealing. The patient was discharged on 6 weeks of ceftriaxone and 2 weeks of gentamicin with an eventual overall recovery. Recurrent IE is a feared complication of IE. Risk factors like prosthetic heart valve endocarditis, positive valve cultures obtained at time of surgical intervention, persistent postoperative fever, IVDU, prior history of IE, and chronic dialysis. Our patient likely had re -infection with the sam e pathogen, S. mitis, given multiple risk factors including prosthetic heart valve endocarditis, IVDU history, and prior IE. Our patient presented with a unique case of recurrent IE with the same pathogen, S mitis, despite proper IV antibiotic treatment, v alve replacement, valvular abscess repairment, and abstinence from IVDU for 2 years. The infection source remains unclear after thorough workup. This case serves as a reminder that prevention of recurrent IE continues to be challenging even with diagnostic advancement and adequate treatment. Future surveillance and prophylactic guidelines are needed to lower the risks of recurrent IE.

She had a road traffic accident with a penetrating injury to the right ankle two years ago, following which she had a chronic non -healing wound i n her right ankle, which has been worsening for the past week. She had many episodes of wound debridement and received hyperbaric therapy for the same. While being evaluated for her ankle wound, she also reported blurred vision in her left eye and seeing b lack spots since waking up that morning. She denied eye pain and pain with eye movement. She had homozygous sickle cell disease (HbSS), with hemoglobin electrophoresis done less than 12 months before showing HbS of 90%, HbF of 7%, and HbA2 of 0%. She has had multiple episodes of sickle cell crises; the last one was six years ago. Her last blood transfusion was five years ago. She also had avascular necrosis of both femur necks and total hip arthroplasty more than 20 years ago. She was on hydroxyurea, which she stopped two years ago after the ankle injury. Patient was hemodynamically stable . Laboratory analysis was pertinent for anemia with an elevated reticulocyte count . A computed tomography scan of the head showed no acute intracranial abnormalities .Bra in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed no acute intracranial pathology; however, an MRI of the orbits showed mild contrast enhancement identified at the mid -to-anterior left optic nerve suggestive of optic neuritis, bilateral orbital globes, and extrao cular muscles appeared unremarkable. A dilated fundus examination of the left eye showed a giant retinal tear with retinal detachment. The patient underwent emergent repair of the retinal detachment .

She had a motor vehicle accident 7 days prior with normal CT head at that time. Social history was notable for a job in cleaning of old homes, kittens as pets, and polysubstance abuse with IV heroin and cocaine. Family history was notable for separate aunts with lupus and cancers including breas t, uterine, and ovarian. On admission, patient was vitally stable, however had pseudobulbar affect, was AAOx1, and was unable follow complex commands; otherwise motor exam and labs were within normal limits. MRI brain with contrast showed diffusion restric tion and mild enhancement in the left parietal lobe subcortical and periventricular white matter. MR Spectroscopy elevated choline: creatine ratio and decreased NAA, suggestive of possible malignancy. Lumbar puncture revealed CSF with negati ve cytology, positive oligoclonal bands, and elevated IgG index of 0.7. Infectious workup was negative. During hospitalization, the patient had rapidly progressive agitation and confusion, requiring sedation and intubation. Differential diagnoses included autoimmune encephalopathy, however primary CNS malignancy could not be ruled out without biopsy. Left parietal brain biopsy showed histiocytic proliferation with nuclei, myelin loss, occasional perivascular s consistent with \"tumefactive\" The patient was started on solumedrol 1g IV qd for 5 days, received 5 sessions of plasma exchange (PLEX) every 48 hours, and 1000mg IV Rituximab. The patient subsequently had improved agitation an d behavior however had persistent peripheral vision loss and mild aphasia. She was discharged to rehab, and continues follow -up with neurology. TDL's, or tumefactive multiple sclerosis, are large (>2cm) tumor -like demyelinating lesions in the CNS and are diagnostically challenging due to similar symptomology and appearance to CNS neoplasms or abscesses. TDL are rare variants of MS and often the first presenting neurological event, predominantly in young females with rapidly progressive multifocal CNS sympto ms within days to weeks. Pathophysiology is linked to pro -inflammatory cytokines. MRI may reveal closed rings or concentric patterns often in frontal or parietal lobes. CSF analysis and MRS may differentiate primary CNS lymphoma from TDL; an increased chol ine/NAA ratio may TDS but is also found CNS malignancies. Histopathology shows inflammatory cells, reactive astrocytes with multiple nuclei (Creuztfelt -Peters Cells). Prognosis is favorable if treated early with immune -modulatory agents as above. However, given its rarity, rapid progression, and wide differential, tumefactive MS remains diagnostically challenging and requires close monitoring and collaboration by interdisciplinary medical teams.

Sekun Lee, Nicholas Flugrad, MD [1,2,3], Kevin Lee, MD [1,2,3] Stacey Doumas, MD, MBA [1,2,3] 1: Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune, NJ 2: Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, Nutley, NJ 3: Hackensack Meridian Health The patient is a single, employed, domiciled, Caucasian who is in their mid -20s brought in by their family to the emergency room for severe dehydration due to weight loss of 10 pounds in 2 weeks in the setting of chronic Anorexia Nervosa (AN). They were admitted medically with the goal to facilitate a transfer to an inpatient eating disorder unit. Psychiatry was consulted for anorexia in the setting of a body mass index (BMI) of 12. Past medical -psychiatric history is significant for AN with purging since teenage years and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) resulting from traumatic events. They had multiple visits to various healthcare settings over the course of 5 years due to complaints secondary to AN and worsening BMI. Follow -up care was performed for monitoring. The patient was connected with therapists, nutritionists, and primary care physician (PCP) but did not improve as the patient's BMI remained low (16 -17). Their vita l signs remained unchanged during these visits and, in some cases, vital signs were not performed. Prior to a telepsychiatry visit in the spring of 2021 for concentration deficit in the context of GAD, they had been prescribed escitalopram by PCP for GAD. The patient was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by the telepsychiatrist and was prescribed a psychostimulant without undergoing an appropriate physical exam and diagnostic testing. Despite a longstanding history of AN and GAD , they continued to take prescribed stimulants until the fall of 2022 when the patient presented to the emergency room for severe dehydration in the setting of a worsening BMI of 12 and was seen by the consultation psychiatry team. Psychostimulant was disc ontinued. The patient was treated by a multidisciplinary team involving a psychiatrist, psychologist, nutritionist, hospitalist, bioethics, and pastoral care prior to being transferred to Inpatient eating disorder unit after medical stabilization. The use of stimulants in patients with AN and GAD is a complex area of psychiatric practice that necessitates a comprehensive evaluation consisting of thorough medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to identify potential risks and contraindica tions. Close collaboration with other members of the patient's treatment team is essential as misuse of stimulants in patients with AN and GAD can lead to severe adverse outcomes, including exacerbation of anxiety and eating disorder and even sudden cardia c death. The DEA waived the Ryan Haight Act's in -person exam requirement for prescriptions of controlled substances as a result of the COVID -19 public health emergency, allowing both established and new patients to receive medically necessary prescriptions via telemedicine. This case highlights the importance of adhering to appropriate standards of practice in healthcare settings, especially in telemedicine, when prescribing controlled substances and how failure to adhere to standards can have grave consequ ences.

The headache was described as bitemporal, radiating to his back and neck with associated fever, mild neck stiffness and photopho bia. His temperature was 103.3 *F, blood pressure 167/72 mmHg. Neck rigidity was noted on examination. Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's sign negative. Computed tomography head showed a stable arachnoid cyst within the right middle cranial fossa without mass effect. With high suspicion for meningitis, the patient was immediately given intravenous corticosteroids. Blood cultures were obtained and he was started on empiric antibiotics. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis from a lumbar puncture was consistent wi th bacterial meningitis: 1833 white blood cells/mm*3 (reference (0.5 -0.8). CSF meningitis panel was negativ e for all typical pathogens. Blood cultures grew streptococcus gordonii, which was believed to be the source of this patient's meningitis. Given suspicion for endocarditis, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms were completed and were negative for any vegetations. On further investigation, the patient reported a habit of dental flossing with occasional bleeding from his gums. He also confessed to re -using the same floss multiple times which raised our suspicion as the potential source of pathoge n entry into the bloodstream. Discussion: Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges, the protective membrane covering the brain and spinal cord. Inflammation is usually associated with bacterial or viral infections. The classic presentation includes fever, headache, and nuchal rigidity. Presenta tion and severity can vary depending on the causative organism. Streptococcus gordonii is a gram positive bacteria commonly found in the human body, including the skin, oral cavity, and upper respiratory tract. It is often colonized in the oral cavity and if allowed, may act as an opportunistic pathogen, leading to the development of periodontal disease. S. gordonii can also enter the bloodstream through open oral wounds, possibly caused by vigorous flossing, inciting many systemic infections including infe ctive endocarditis, pulmonary empyemas, septic arthritis, and spinal infections. However, there is little to no evidence of this pathogen crossing the blood brain barrier and causing meningitis. Our case depicts a unique presentation of bacterial meningiti s caused by an unlikely oral cavity pathogen, S. gordonii. While previous studies have proven transient bacteremia after flossing, there is no known correlation with development of CSF infections. Dental hygiene was likely the etiology of this patient's ba cteremia. However, further investigation into possible risk factors that disrupt the blood brain barrier, including an arachnoid cyst, is warranted.

Department of Gastroenterology, Hackensack Meridian Health, Palisades Medical Center, North Bergen, NJ, USA Learning Objective: Highlight the importance of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) screening in patients with cirrhosis. Understand progressive effects of hepatocellular carcinoma Case Description: An 81 year old woman with history of decompensated NASH cirrhosis with varices, portal hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dementia was referred from a nursing home for hypotension. Her vitals on presentation were significant for blood pressure 94/45, heart rate 102 and temperature 95.6 F. On examination, she was noted to be in altered mental status with scleral icterus and diffuse ab dominal tenderness. Her pertinent labs include hemoglobin 8.2 alanine aminotransferase 60, aspartate aminotransferase 16, (direct INR 1.53, albumin 2.1 and ammonia 28. Initial CT abdomen revealed a cirrho tic liver with new 13.4 x 10.4 cm mass in the right hepatic lobe suggestive of hepatocellular carcinoma with an enlarged possible metastatic thoracic node. The right perihepatic space contained a 12.9 x 2.3 cm fluid collection concerning for hemorrhage. Her subsequent CT angiogram showed hyperdense material suggestive of blood without active extravasation but again seen was a hepatic mass with compression and mass effect on the right atrium. Her AFP level was elevated to >300,000 ng/mL. Further aggressive i nterventions for the mass was not pursued due to her known comorbidities and complicated hospital course including ventilator dependent respiratory failure and multiple cardiac arrests. The patient died on hospital day 5 due to a cardiac arrest after the f amily opted to pursue hospice care. Discussion: HCC is the fifth most common cancer in the world with 80% of patients diagnosed having underlying cirrhosis. HCC surveillance is recommended for all cirrhosis patients with Child Pugh A, B and also Child Pug h C awaiting transplant. We describe a patient with h/o Child Pugh B cirrhosis, with normal AFP and no mass on previous imaging 2 years ago now presenting with probable metastatic HCC. Her presentation was remarkable for a large hepatic mass causing cardia c compression. Although case reports have described cardiac metastasis, right atrium compression by HCC has not been reported to our knowledge previously. It is important to carefully monitor patients with cirrhosis for HCC screening with ultrasound every six months. This case highlights the importance of HCC screening in cirrhotic patients and highlights the possibility of liver tumor burden causing cardiorespiratory compromise due to diminished preload.

In the literature ALS was classified according to 3 categories based on age at onset of symptom: Juvenile onset (<20 years), Young onset (20 -45 years) and Classic/Older onset (>45 years). ALS has also been characterized by 3 different phenotypes based on presenting predominant motor neuron signs: Classic Charcot (combined UMN & LMN), UMN - predominant and LMN -predominant phenotype s. In this report, we describe a rapidly progressive case of ALS presenting with LMN symptoms in a 33 -year-old male with less than 1 year survival since onset of symptoms. Physical examination findings on initial evaluation were remarkable for flaccid weak ness with muscle atrophy without associated UMN symptoms. Laboratory studies and imaging studies including CT Head and MRI studies of cervical and thoracic spine were unremarkable. EMG studies were conducted and showed evidence of generalized motor axonal condition involving cranially innervated as well as cervical and lumbosacral innervated muscles with intact sensory nerve studies, after which a diagnosis of ALS was established. We review the available literature and highlight a rare presentation of spora dic LMN -predominant ALS in the young -onset age group of ALS patients. Our case highlights a rare presentation of ALS with regards to clinical manifestations in young -onset age group. These features should be investigated to further characterize sporadic AL S in young -adult patients. While there are studies that show that young -onset ALS patients tend to have spinal onset ALS, more research is needed to characterize the phenotypes (UMN -predominant vs LMN -predominant) that these patients present with. As it pe rtains to family medicine, ALS should be considered in younger patients presenting with LMN symptoms even in the absence of classic UMN symptoms. This might help facilitate quicker definitive diagnosis and treatment initiation, given the rapidly progressiv e nature of ALS that these patients may present with.

She reported a recent sick contact of a niece with mononucleosis. In the emergency department, vitals were within normal limits and physical examination was only significant for cervical, axillary and inguinal l ymphadenopathy. Labs were significant for EBV biofire meningitis panel, which scan showed retroperitoneal, y. Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular bone marrow without any concern for neoplasia or lymphoproliferative process. Left axillary lymph node biopsy showed a benign lymph node with reactive changes, which was not considered typical pathology in Kikuchi syndrome, however it did show focal paracortical nodular hyperplasia. Remaining work up was completely negative for any other alternate etiology. Given the clinical presentation with lymphadenopathy, aseptic meningitis, actively replicating EBV with EBV i nfection being a known trigger for Kikuchi syndrome, the patient was empirically treated with steroids. Within a few days she reported considerable improvement in her headache and fevers, and was discharged on oral steroids with outpatient follow up. Discussion: Kikuchi disease also known as Kikuchi -Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare disease which can manifest with persistent fevers and lymphadenopathy. One of the unusual manifestations of this disease is aseptic meningitis, which our patient was seen to pre sent with. KFD is thought to be due to an autoimmune reaction generated by the body in response to triggers like viral infections. EBV is one of the commonly implicated viruses, which was seen actively replicating in our patient as well. Due to the similar ity of its manifestations to other common conditions, including infections and lymphomas, a high degree of suspicion is needed to diagnose KFD. A lymph node biopsy helps with definitive diagnosis. The histopathological changes seen are dynamic and variable . They can be divided into three types based on progression of the disease: proliferative, necrotizing and exanthematous. KFD is usually a self - limited disease however in patients with severe symptoms or neurological manifestations, glucocorticoids have be en proven to be extremely effective. We believe that increasing awareness about this condition is critical to help diagnose more patients and provide appropriate treatment.

He was afebrile and had normal vitals. Physical exam, including the cardiopulmonary exam, was normal except for the right knee which was swollen and tender but non -erythematous. He had a leukocytosis of 13.9 10*3/uL (4.5 - 11.0 10*3/uL). ESR and 36,930 /\u00b5L (0 -200 /\u00b5L) and no crystal or organism growth. HbA1C was 11.5% (<5.7%). A chest x -ray revealed an incidental cavitary mass in the right upper lobe measuring 6.5 x 5.5 cm with central cavitation measuring 2.4 x 2.3 cm and mediastinal adenopathy. The patient denied having any lower respi ratory symptoms, history of smoking or drug use, recent travel, episodes of pneumonia, or history of incarceration. A further work -up for mycobacteria, HIV antigens and antibodies, and vasculitis antibodies were negative. Blood cultures grew positive for G roup A streptococcus (GAS), prompting treatment with IV Unasyn. An echocardiogram showed no valvular lesions or vegetations. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed and yielded positive cultures for Candida Albicans. Cytology and gram stain were negat ive for malignancy, acid fast bacilli, and virulent bacteria. The patient's knee pain improved after aspiration, drainage, and antibiotics. He was sent home with a midline catheter for treatment of IV ceftriaxone for three weeks for necrotizing pneumonia. This patient had incidental GAS bacteremia, and he should be evaluated and treated promptly for pathological sequelae, such as acute rheumatic fever especially with joint pain. However, he had a monoarthritis without other major Jones criteria, making his presentation most likely post -strep reactive arthritis. Necrotizing pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pyogenes is rare. However, in immunocompromised patients, such as those with uncontrolled diabetes, active strep infection can present with such probable morbidities. Necrotizing pneumonia also presents acutely and is thus atypical to be asymptomatic. The Candida in lavage cultures was most likely normal respiratory flora as antibiotics were started prior to the procedure. The more common etiologies of cavi tary lung lesions including mycoplasma, neoplasms, autoimmune, and granulomatous diseases were ruled out with blood work and BAL. Treatment for necrotizing pneumonia involves a prolonged course of antibiotics and debridement in cases of extensive necrosis. This case demonstrates the importance of routine follow up in patients, particularly in the immunocompromised, as they may house subclinically invasive disease which, if left untreated, can develop into significant infection. This case also brings to ligh t the importance of strict follow up with GAS infections as there is potential for great harm and significant sequelae if treatment is delayed.

T-cell/histiocyte -rich large B -cell lymphoma (THRLBCL) is an extremely rare and aggressive subtype of diffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that typically presents in middle -aged patients and carries a poor prognosis. Hypercalcemia presenting as the initial manifestation of the disease is rare, with only one other case reported in the literature. We report a case of a 90 -year- old male who presented with progressive lethargy and unintentional weight loss. Initial workup showed elevated serum calcium 14.6 mg/dL, corrected for albumin, and creatinine of 1.51 mg/dL. He had a suppressed intact parathyroid hormone (PTH, 6.3 pg/mL) and normal parathyroid hormone -related peptide (PTHrP, 13 pg/mL). CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out underlying malignancy, which showed splenomegaly and enlarged retrocrural and porta hepatis lymph nodes. Bone marrow biopsy was performed to evaluate for hematological malignancy, which revealed findings diagnostic of THRLBCL. While Rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R -CHOP) is one of the mainstay therapies for DLBCL and has been shown to have comparable out comes in THRLBCL, there are documented concerns with its toxicity profile limiting the ability of older patients (60 years and older) to complete therapy. Our patient was treated with R -mini-CHOP, which is much better tolerated in this patient demographic. R-mini-CHOP features decreased doses of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) with the conventional dose of rituximab. This case discusses a rare subtype of non -Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting with a unique manifestation of hyper calcemia. We highlight the importance of thorough investigation for causes of hypercalcemia as well as the efficacy and tolerability of R -mini-CHOP in this elderly patient demographic.

Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan [4] Kazakh National MedicalUniversity, Almaty, Kazakhstan [5] Department of Radiology, Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Neptune, NJ, USA We report a case of an older -aged male with past medical history of atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban, hypertension, chronic nons teroidal anti -inflammatory medication (NSAID) for back pain who presented with dizziness, nonbloody nonbilious vomiting and multiple episodes of hematochezia. Vitals were pressure 156/73 mmHg, heart rate 125/min, afebrile, and saturating well on room air. On exam, the patient has orthostatic hypotension. Lab values are significant for Prothrombin Time 26.2 sec (10.1 -13.3 sec), International Normalized into the duodenum from a branch of the gastroduodenal artery. The patie nt was started on a proton pump inhibitor drip, rivaroxaban stopped, 2 units of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) were given, and the patient was transferred to the ICU. He continued to have hematochezia, and hemoglobin dropped to 7.9g/dL. Another 3 units of PRBCs and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma were given. The patient underwent emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) which showed a single Dieulafoy lesion (DL) with active bleeding in the second portion of the duodenum. Bleeding was successfully managed w ith epinephrine, cauterized with bipolar probe, and hemostatic clip placement. Hemoglobin was stable following the procedure. The patient was discharged on PPI twice daily and restarted on Rivaroxaban seven days after EGD. Patient was stable at his 4 -week outpatient follow -up without signs of active bleeding. Duodenal Dieulafoys (DLs) account for only 1 -2% of acute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding characterized by abnormal dilations and exposed blood vessels in the submucosal layer of the GI tract, protruding through a small puncture in overlying normal mucosal tissue. DLs are important to recognize as potentional causes of GI bleeding given their high mortality rate of up to 80%. Given our patients history of chronic NSAID use it was important to distinguish between DL and peptic ulcer disease for appropriate management. DLs are primarily in the stomach, within 6cm of the gastroesophageal junction. 15% of cases are in the duodenum, as in our patient. Recent literature has demonstrated multiple endoscopic attem pts are often needed to identify and treat DLs. However, the patient in our case was successfully treated on the first attempt aided by CTA prior to endoscopy. A combination of endoscopic therapies was utilized and contributed to the successful control of the DL and prevented rebleeding. This paper emphasizes the importance of imaging prior to endoscopy, particularly if the patient is clinically stable, to increase the likelihood of successful first -attempt management of the bleeding DL.

Hovnanian Children's Hospital, Department o f Pediatrics Case Summary: A 16 month -old unimmunized male with a recent diagnosis of Rickets disease presented approximately a week later following his diagnosis with three new -onset tonic -clonic seizures associated with perioral cyanosis and foaming at the mouth. His seizures lasted approximately 1 minute in duration followed by a brief post -ictal period. The parents also endorsed feeding the patient a vegan diet. The physical examination of the patient was performed while the patient was post -ictal foll owing the third tonic -clonic seizure. It demonstrated profound hypotonia in the upper and lower extremities as well as decreased brachial and patellar reflexes. Following the patient's post -ictal period and return back to baseline, his physical examination was within normal limits with return of his tone and reflexes. Initial laboratory studies revealed evidence of hyperparathyroidism, hypovitaminosis D, and iron deficiency based on the following results: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) of 269.0 pg/mL (18.4 - hydroxy level ng/mL (30 -100 ng/mL); Iron level of <2 mcg/dL (65 -175 mcg/dL). Imaging studies that were performed included head CT that resulted within normal limits, bone survey that demonstrated long bone metaphyses synonymous with hypophosphatemic rickets, and MRI of the pituitary that was within normal limits. He also underwent video EEG (VEEG) that resulted within normal limits and a lumbar puncture with CSF studies that demonstrated aseptic meningitis. The patient was diagnosed with Secondary Hyperparathyroidism causing hypocalcemia and hypovitaminosis D with deficiency in iron and was started on calcium, vitamin D, and ferrous sulfat e supplementation. Patient was discharged with close follow up with endocrinology, neurology, and the developmental pediatrician. Conclusion: Alternative dietary habits, such as vegetarian and vegan diets, exclude and replace specific foods in order to ma intain nutritional benefits. The case discussed, highlights potential negative consequences if appropriate nutritional supplementation is not provided. Infants may be prone to metabolic derangements, which may lead to irreversible long -term consequences, s uch as developmental delay and irregular bone formation. Furthermore, collecting a thorough social history is vital to diagnose this uncommon pediatric endocrinopathy.

She also described nausea, anorexia, recent weight loss, pruritus and dark urine. Physical exam was remarkable f or jaundice, scleral icterus and epigastric tenderness. The patient had been taking doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 30 days every other month for the past two years for a prosthetic knee joint infection. Other medications include amlodipine 10mg daily a nd calcium -vitamin D supplement. She denied herbal supplements alcohol. She was sent from the clinic to the emergency department for further n. At admission, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was 500 IU/L and aspartate aminotransferase IU/L. Alk was 162 IU/L. Total bilirubin was 18.3 mg/dL. Antinuclear antibody was negative, smooth muscle antibody was positive >20U, IgG levels were elevated at 213 and lipase was elevated. Serologic testing for viral hepatitis was negative. Right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed hepatic cirrhosis and steatosis, with no definitive gallstones. Magnetic resonance suggested peripancreatic edema. A 5 mm endoscopic retrograde showed panlobular cholestasis suggesting drug -induced liver injury (DILI) or autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). By discontinuing doxycycline, a reduction of ALT and AST by 47% and 43.6% respectively within 4 days of admission. The patient was subsequently started on prednisone 40 mg and azathioprine daily. Liver enzymes on follow -up in 76 days. Discussion/Conclusion: DILI is an important cause of hepatotoxicity, with significant morbidity and mortality. Establishi ng a diagnosis, however, is a challenge because DILI can mimic all forms of liver disease. It is estimated that up to 9% of suspected cases of AIH are drug -induced. Although drug -induced autoimmune hepatitis has been commonly associated with minocycline, doxycycline has rarely been implicated despite structural similarities. This may be because, unlike minocycline, doxycycline is often used in a low -dose long -term regimen. With no serological markers available, it remains a diagnosis of exclusion requiring prompt clinical action. In the present case, the histologic findings as well as the dramatic reduction in liver enzymes within 4 days of withdrawal of doxycycline favor DILI with autoimmune features. Given the severity of symptoms and liver injury, the pat ient was also treated with immunosuppressants inducing remission. With the widespread use of doxycycline, it is important for physicians to recognize the possible role of doxycycline -induced liver injury.

Hackensack Meridian Health Jersey Shore University Medical Center, De partment of General Surgery [3]. Hackensack Meridian Health Jersey Shore University Medical Center, Department of Surgical Oncology Case Summary: A 33 y/o female with a history of undifferentiated autoimmune disease, HPV and HSV presented for a painless r ight inguinal mass of a 2 month duration. History is significant for intermittently swollen axillary and inguinal lymph nodes, originally attributed to her autoimmune disease. She denied unintentional weight loss, fatigue, malaise, fevers, recent illness o r trauma. Physical exam revealed 2 x 2 cm hard mass to the deep right inguinal region. Ultrasound of the right groin showed an elliptical 2.1 x 0.7 x 1.2 cm hypoechoic almost anechoic mass of unclear etiology with no hilum noted to indicate an abnormal lym ph node. Due to the patient's history of an autoimmune disease and the 2 month duration of the mass, surgical excision was recommended. Operative examination revealed a fluid filled, broad based mass in the suprapubic fat pad superficially with an unusual fluid filled stalk extending toward the internal inguinal ring. The ring appeared intact and no indirect or direct hernia defects were identified. As a result, high ligation of the stalk was completed and the cystic mass along with its stalk were excised. Final pathology revealed benign fibromuscular tissue with multiloculated cystic spaces lined by flat to cuboidal cells containing serous fluid compatible with a hydrocele of the Canal of Nuck (HCN). Discussion: The canal of Nuck is a small invagination of the parietal peritoneum which is attached to the uterus by the round ligament through the internal inguinal ring into the inguinal canal. In normal development, this structure obliterates within the first year of life, however its patency, homologous to a patent processus vaginalis in men, can predispose women to the development of a Canal of Nuck hydrocele later in life, most commonly during the 4th decade. The formation of a hydrocele is often due to idiopathic imbalances of fluid secretion and absorptio n. Due to its limited prevalence in adult females, these hydroceles represent a diagnostic challenge for surgeons when addressing groin masses in women. Nearly two dozen cases of HCN have been reported in the literature, with the majority of these hydrocel es identified at various points throughout the inguinal tract. We present a rare case of HCN in an unusual location, the suprapubic fat pad. The location of HCN outside of its usual tract in the inguinal canal serves as an important reminder that there is a wide breadth of pathology which may arise from the suprapubic and inguinal region in women. While the inguinal region is well characterized in men, its relative lower pathologic frequency in women leaves a large gap in the literature which reported obser vations of unique pathology help to fill. This unique case further helps us to characterize the uniqueness of pathology in the female suprapubic and inguinal region.

A rare entity is Primary Renal Magnesium Syndrome with disorders in renal tubular defect s resulting in electrolyte imbalance. We describe a patient who presented with severe hypomagnesemia and urinary magnesium wasting multiple times to hospital with extensive work up negative for common causes of hypomagnesemia CASE REPORT: A 33 -year-old ma le came to the ED with non -specific symptoms of headache and generalized malaise for several months. Physical examination findings were unremarkable except for an elevated BP of 148/88. Initial lab work revealed severe hypokalemia ( K 3.5mmol/L ),hypomagne semia (Mg 1.1mg/dL) and Na of 125 mmol/L. All the history pertaining to vomiting, diarrhea, polyuria, prior use of any laxative or hypertensive including diuretic and alcohol abuse was negative. Review of the system was positive for headache and vertigo. B lood Alcohol level was negative. This was the patient's third visit with similar electrolyte abnormality within 2 months. The patient's electrolyte abnormality prompted additional lab testing with results significant for high urinary Mg at 335 mg/g with Fe Mg 23% ( normal <2% )but with normal rest of the urine electrolytes. Rest of the lab work was also unremarkable with negative metanephrines, Normal ACTH, normal renin and aldosterone. CT scan abdomen to rule out adrenal pathology was also negative. Through out the admission , his BP stayed under control. As medical therapy aims at correcting electrolyte abnormality ,the patient was started on oral potassium and magnesium supplements. Patient had regular follow up with us in the clinic where his lab abnormali ties gradually improved with clinical improvement in his symptoms, with continuation of oral magnesium oxide daily. DISCUSSION: Primary Renal Magnesium Syndrome is a rare cause of hypomagnesemia. If no etiology is apparent, the distinction between GI and renal losses can be made by measuring either 24 hr urinary Mg excretion or FeMg. To diagnose primary renal magnesium syndrome, a daily excretion of more than 10 -30 mg in 24 hour specimen or fractional excretion of 3 - 4% is indicative. The cases reported are heterogeneous. Several cases have affected siblings or parents representing familial disease. Our literature review revealed t hat likely the patient had a tubular defect in renal absorption of magnesium demonstrated by high urinary excretion while in a state of deficiency . Further case studies revealed if oral magnesium fails to improve levels, addition of Potassium sparing diur etic especially amiloride use can help hypomagnesemia.

He had a tactile fever for 1 day. Stools had been looser than usual. Tolerating feeds. No lethargy, vomiting, cough, or congestion. Mom denies any history of STDs or genital lesions. Patient was born at 39w0d by repeat c -section. Prenatal history significant only for hepatitis C and methadone use. In the newborn nursery, patient was monitored for NAS but never required treatment. Exam Erythema along buttocks crease, inner thighs, and scrotum, with punched -out lesions and satellite lesions 1 vesicular lesion on right thigh Few inguinal lymphadenopathy Labs xanthochromia CSF - infants exposed after birth to active HSV lesions of household or caregiver contacts. Incidence of neonatal HSV is 3 to 30 per 100,000 live births world wide In the US 8 to 10 cases per 10 0,000 live births. There are an estimated 14,000 cases of neonatal HSV infections per year worldwide. Based on the appearance of the patient's rash and worsening of the patient's rash over a prolonged period of time, suspicion for HSV infection was high despite negative maternal history of HSV. Lumbar puncture performed to rule out CNS infection. 30% of neonatal herpes infections present as CNS disease, so it was important to rule out herpes meningitis. Patients with neonatal herpes typically present within the first month of life, but our patient presented at 7 weeks which is atypical. The patient was thus treated for 10 days, because HSV was most likely acquired postnatally based on the patient's age, > 6 weeks. For infections like HSV, it is also importan t to perform a full workup to rule out life threatening sequelae such as HSV meningitis, thus performing a LP, obtaining blood, urine, and wound cultures of the lesions as well as testing for both HSV 1+2 PCR and IGG antibodies. Although 10% of neonatal HS V infections are acquired postnatally it is important to take a detailed maternal and family history as well as recognize a HSV rash. It is also important to initiate antiviral treatment and provide anticipatory guidance in parents who have HSV. Although p ost natal HSV infection does not have significant effects on neurodevelopment of the infant, if it was acquired perinatally then prompt initiation of antiretrovirals is important to prevent disseminated disease which could result in long term complications and even death.

In patients with both conditions, the incidence of lower extremity amputation is particularly high. One potential surgical approach to primarily close large soft tissue deficits that would otherwise require healing via secondary intent is the use of a fillet of toe flap. Fillet of toe flaps are a type of axial pattern flap that can be harvested from non -functioning or unsalvageable osseous and soft tissue structures. The se flaps can be utilized as pedicles, islands, or microvascular free flaps for reconstruction. The Stryker Spy Cam Elite is a valuable tool for the preoperative planning of this procedure through the use of a fluorescent dye and specialized scanner that pe rmits precise, real - time evaluation of perfusion through the microvasculature of soft tissues. We present a case report of a 67 -year-old man with a past medical history significant for uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, serial amputations ultimately resulting i n an an above the knee amputation (AKA) of the right lower extremity, and severe PAD who underwent a fillet of toe flap on his left foot. The Stryker Spy Cam Elite provided a high -quality, real -time video feed as the dye perfused through the microvasculatu re; this resulted in precise excision of non -viable tissues not yet exhibiting clinical evidence of necrosis through demarcation. The viable tissues of the 4th digit provided a well-perfused flap that was transposed to cover a large soft tissue deficit ove r metatarsal heads two through four following digital amputation. The patient followed up bi -weekly in the wound care center; he attained full healing of the surgical site without any post -operative complications. The use of the Spy Cam Elite System in con junction with the fillet of toe flap improved this patient's surgical outcome by significantly decreasing the overall risk of post -operative complications.

The patient reported new -onset left -sided weakness, left -hand tingling sensation, and left eye blurriness that started early in the morning. He stated that since the weakness started it had been getting progressively worse. Patient denied any head aches, dizziness, syncope, seizures, dysphagia, memory impairment, chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath or lower extremity pain. He was sent to the ED by his facility but endorsed that his symptoms resolved prior to arrival. Patient also endorsed prior CVA and residual right lower extremity weakness. He was non -adherent to his medications and stated that he missed a few doses of his aspirin and apixaban but endorsed taking them the morning prior to his admission. Due to concern for an acute stroke or transient ischemic attack, a computed tomography (CT) scan imaging of the head without contrast was performed and the results revealed multifocal areas of encephalomalacia and gliosis within the left parietal/cerebellar lobes, as well as the right occip ital lobe, and tortuosity of the basilar artery (Figure 1). He was unable to tolerate magnetic resonance imaging due to claustrophobia. A CT angiogram of the head and neck revealed non - visualization of the right internal carotid artery, suggestive of conge nital absence of this vessel (Figure 2). Additionally, right anterior circulation appeared to be supplied by collateral branches of the distal basilar artery and imaging revealed no carotid artery stenosis. Additional work -up for stroke etiology was comple ted which involved an unremarkable electrocardiogram. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55 -60% with no left atrial thrombus. The patient was seen by the neurology team and after a comprehensive workup that was negative for oth er causes of the patient's ischemic stroke, it was concluded that the patient's absent right ICA was the underlying etiology. It was believed that his right -sided ICA absence put a strain on his collateral circulation resulting in primarily left -sided sens ory and motor symptoms. The data surrounding the clinical significance of ICA agenesis is scarce likely due to the incredibly rare nature of this condition. Typically congenital absence of an ICA is often diagnosed incidentally during imaging of the cerebr al vessels, it is important for clinicians to be aware of the findings and the potential implications of the anomaly. While ICA agenesis alone can be harmless, it is important for clinicians to be aware of the concurrent structural vascular abnormalities t hat are often seen including cerebral aneurysms. This case report hopes to provide an overview of ICA agenesis.

Symptoms of weakness, swelling, and fatigue sta rted after chemotherapy was initiated. Patient was receiving carboplatin/paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin for chemotherapy and pembrolizumab for immunotherapy. The patient last received chemotherapy four months and immunotherapy two months prior to presentation. The patient was hemodynamically stable with elevated d -dimer of 2069 ng/mL, hemoglobin 7.7 g/dL, leukopenia of 3.1, and an elevated high sensitivity troponin I of 83 ng/L (ref range: <34 ng/L). Electrocardiogram was significant for sinus rhythm with first -degree atrioventricular block and low voltage QRS, <5 mm in leads II and III. A chest computed tomography angiogram revealed pulmonary venous congestion with trace pericardial effusion. Echocardiography showed a reduced ejection fraction of 51 -54%, physiologic pericardial effusion, and global longitudinal strain of -14. Further investigation with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed findings consistent with myocarditis based on 2018 Lake Louise criteria. Thyroid stimulating ho rmone was elevated at 87.08 ulU/mL and free T4 was decreased at 0.14 ng/dL, with previous values being 1.365 ulU/mL and 1.37 ng/dL respectively. Hypothyroidism was suspected to be secondary to pembrolizumab and thyroid peroxidase antibodies were found to b e elevated. The patient was started on five days of prednisone 80 mg daily for myocarditis and levothyroxine 125 mcg daily for thyroid hormone replacement. The patient's symptoms resolved and she was discharged with outpatient follow -up. Discussion: Mort ality of 25 -50% is associated with ICPi myocarditis and sequelae, including arrhythmias and cardiomyopathy, making this an important adverse effect to recognize [4]. Recognizing these potentially fatal side effects of ICPis may increase patient safety, and also have additional clinical importance as the rate of response to immunotherapy was found to be higher in patients with reported immune -mediated adverse reactions [5]. While immune checkpoint inhibitors have served as a major breakthrough in managing a multitude of cancers, it is important to be aware of the increasing incidence of immune -related adverse events. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of concurrent myocarditis and thyroiditis associated with pembrolizumab. Patients may benefit from cardiac and thyroid function screening before and during the initiation of ICPis. Further studies are needed to assess for prevalence and timely treatment of complications to help better patient outcomes. Abstract # 172 HMH Resident & Fellow Research Day: May 23 , 202 3 Click to Return to Table of Contents 172 TWO L'S: Department of Internal Medicine, Jersey Shore University Medical Center, 1945 NJ -33, Neptune City, NJ 07753 Patient is a 70 -year-old female with a past medical history of epilepsy, liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, prior hepatic encephalopathy, morbid obesity, and uterine cancer who presented with confusion and shaking from home after her concerned hus band called emergency medical services. In the emergency department (ED) the patient had a Glasgow coma scale of 4 and was intubated for airway protection. Workup at the time of admission revealed septic shock secondary to Escherichia coli urinary tract in fection (UTI) and bacteremia. Patient was started on ceftriaxone for the UTI and moved to the neurological intensive care unit for multifactorial encephalopathy and further work -up including video EEG for potential seizures. Patient was eventually extubate d and transferred to medicine floors after a course of antibiotics. The patient's hospital course was complicated by multiple rapid responses for hypotension and altered mental status that ultimately lead to her care being escalated to the medical intensiv e care unit (ICU) due to intubation. Patient was found to have toxic metabolic encephalopathy and also found to be bacteremic with vancomycin -resistant enterococcus faecium (VRE) and Candida. Patient was started on fluconazole and linezolid. After six days of linezolid, the patient was found to have elevated lactic acid of 7.8 mmol/L from a previous lactic acid of 2 mmol/L and an anion gap of 18. Linezolid was stopped and there was a significant improvement of the lactic acid to 6.3 mmol/L and anion gap to 15. Lactic acid continued to downtrend after discontinuation of linezolid and without any other significant intervention. Patient was not hypoxemic, anemic or in a low cardiac output state during this time. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, however, and the decision was made to transition to comfort care. Discussion: The first line agent for VRE infections and bacteremia in the majority of cases is linezolid although it is a bacteriostatic drug [2]. Lactic linezolid and mitochondrial ribosomes causing a decrease in aerobic energy production and increasing anaerobic glycolysis and generation of lactate, despite no hypoxia [3]. In a review of case reports, it was found that the inc idence was ~6.8%, mortality associated with linezolid lactic acidosis was 25.5% and found that male gender may be related to increased mortality [4 -5]. Due to the highly lethal nature of this adverse reaction, close monitoring and prompt discontinuation of linezolid is paramount in lactic acidosis. Further studies on risk factors and interactions that may exacerbate lactic acidosis in patients on linezolid may potentially lead to better patient outcomes.

Esophageal cancer is a major cause of cancer -related deaths worldwide. This cancer has two primary forms: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. In oncology, the term \"metachronous\" describ es the occurrence of two or more independent primary malignancies when the second malignancy arises more than six months after diagnosing the first malignancy. This article presents a unique case of esophageal adenocarcinoma followed by metachronous squamo us cell carcinoma, which has not been well documented in the literature. The patient was a 67-year-old male with a medical history of smoking and T2N0Mx esophageal adenocarcinoma. He presented with complaints of progressive dysphagia and one episode of hem atemesis three years after his initial diagnosis. He had previously undergone chemoradiation and a follow -up esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), revealing no signs of active disease. However, a recent EGD showed a medium -sized, non -bleeding, partially obstru cting, and ulcerating mass in the lower third of the esophagus, which was biopsied and diagnosed as moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Multiple primary malignant tumors (MPMT) are described as multiple malignancies that develop from differe nt tissues with distinct morphologies. Malignancies that develop within six months are defined as \"synchronous,\" while those that develop after six months are defined as \"metachronous.\" The histological subtypes found in our patient did not surprise us, co nsidering squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are the two most prevalent types of esophageal cancer worldwide. Upon extensive review, studies suggest that the metachronous changes seen in our patient are more likely secondary to thermal injury from radio -frequency ablation, as the epithelial origins of columnar and squamous epithelium share common progenitors. For these reasons, eradicating the adenocarcinoma with radio -frequency ablation could have predisposed the tissue to squamous cell proliferati on. Multiple primary malignant tumors have an incidence rate of 0.52% to 11.7%, making it crucial for providers to screen for recurrence and the development of second primary malignancies. Clinicians must be made aware of this risk, and appropriate screeni ng is necessary for patients during and following treatment for the timely diagnosis and management of metachronous lesions.

MD[1], Stacey Damito, DO[2], HUMC [2] Medicine, HUMC [3] Department of Cardiology, HUMC Case Summary: A 66 -year-old man with a history of stage III renal cell carcinoma (RCC) status post r ight nephrectomy, was found to have a cardiac mass during surveillance imaging at one - year follow -up. Patient denied any cardiac symptoms including chest pain, palpitations or syncope. Imaging Findings: Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed a large mas s in the pericardial space adjacent to the tricuspid valve annulus measuring 5.1 x 5.3 cm. The mass appeared to externally compress the right atrium and ventricle with no clear evidence of intracardiac invasion, tricuspid valve obstruction by Doppler and n o effusion. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) showed an ill -defined mass in the right atrioventricular groove that was avidly enhancing with extensive neovascularity supplied by the right coronary artery (RCA). No other masses were identified in the chest or abdomen. Pre -surgical planning cardiac catheterization which showed nonobstructive coronary artery disease and confirmed extensive neo-vascularity of the mass supplied by the RCA. The patient underwent successful resection of the mass. Intrao perative transesophageal echocardiogram showed severe tricuspid insufficiency that repaired with a tricuspid valve annuloplasty ring. Histopathology revealed renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and chemotherapy was initiated. Role of Imaging in Pat ient Care: Cardiac metastases are more common than primary cardiac tumors. Routine surveillance with echocardiography was able to identify this pericardial mass in a patient with no cardiovascular symptoms. RCC most commonly metastases to lung, liver, bone s or central nervous system. It is rare to metastasize to the heart however when it does, hematogenous spread occurs from the renal vein into the inferior vena cava (IVC) and ultimately into the right heart. Metastasis such as with our patient without IVC involvement is exceedingly rare. Discussion/Conclusion: Cardiac metastasis from RCC usually occurs from direct extension from the IVC into the right heart. Although uncommon, RCC may present as a solitary mass in the pericardial space without IVC involvem ent.

Imaging Findings: Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed new mildly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, a mechanical AVR with severe aortic regurgitation and paravalvular leak. A transesop a left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) pseudoaneurysm (PSA) with a clear communication of blood flow from the left ventricle into the PSA by color Doppler. The PSA extended along the ascending aorta to the level of the r ight pulmonary artery. The anatomical lateral leaflet of the AVR was restricted in motion leading to severe valvular regurgitation. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a large outpouching of contrast arising from the right posterior aspect of t he LVOT consistent with PSA. The neck of the outpouching measured 2.4 x 2.0 cm and the sac 6.0 x 3.3 x 5.3 cm. Role of Imaging in Patient Care: TTE imaging is often the first line method used to assess a patient with prior AVR and new murmur. Depending on the PSA location, the ostium and extent of the sac may be challenging to visualize and multimodality imaging may be required. On TEE you can see flow into the PSA by color Doppler with expansion in systole secondary to the entrance of high velocity left ve ntricular blood flow. Cardiac CT can also measure the extent of the PSA, locate its ostium and determine the size. Discussion/Conclusion: LVOT PSA is rare and can have potentially life -threatening complications. It can occur after endocarditis related AVR or from continued aortic root dilation after AVR. As in our patient, it can have a subtle clinical course and detection may occur from routine TTE surveillance with a multimodality approach. Surgical intervention remains the preferred tr eatment.

Hovnanian Children's Hospital, Department of Pediatrics [1] Here we revie w three cases of infants who share similar clinical presentations and electrolyte disturbances, each with a unique diagnosis. Patient 1 was a 4 month -old who presented with two weeks of poor weight gain. Labs revealed leukocytosis, hyponatremia (124 mmol/L ) and hyperkalemia (8.3 mmol/L) with hemolysis (repeated to 5.8 mmol/l without hemolysis). A urinalysis revealed 30 -50 white blood cells and large leukocytes. Patient 2 was a 6 -day old male who presented with poor oral intake, emesis and lethargy. Electrolytes were significant for hyponatremia (124mmol/L) and hyperkalemia (9.4mmol/L). Patient 3 was a 6 week -old presenting with constipation and abnormal labs from an outside hospital with hyponatremia (132mmol/L) and hyperkalemia (9.1mmol/L). Prior to transfer, he received furosemide, albuterol and intravenous saline. Physical exam revealed a thin appearing infant with a mildly sunken fontanelle, dry mucous persisted on repeat labs. Electrolyte abnormalities in infancy require prompt diagnosis and correction to avoid life -threatening complications including cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and in severe cases, mortality. Calcium gluconate will allow for myocardial stabilization. Extracellular to intracellular shifting of potassium can be achieved by albuterol, insulin and sodium bicarbonate. Acute excretion of potassium can be achieved by intravenous furosemide and more long term, through kayexalate, or dialysis if severe. Patient 1 was found to have transient pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA) secondary to a urinary tract infection. Elevated plasma renin of 32.83 ng/dL (0.25 190 (2 -70 ng/dL) in the setting of the infant's UTI confirmed this diagnosis. PHA results from decreased or absent response to aldosterone. Mineralocorticoid supplementation and treatment of the underlying etiology, i.e. antibiotics, should result in normalization of electrolytes. Patient 2 was found to have a rare condition, X -linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita. This diagnosis was made in the context of a normal newborn screen, normal 17 -OHP and absence of 21 -hydroxylase antibodies. Furthermore, an ACTH stimulation test revealed a poor res ponse and inadequate cortisol production. Our patient was started on hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone with improvement in electrolytes. Our third patient's diagnosis emphasizes an importance of mineralocorticoid synthesis in electrolyte homeostasis. An e levated renin (57 ng/dL (0.25 -5.8ng/dL)), ( -220ng/dL) and aldosterone aided in diagnosis. Corticosterone -methyl oxidase deficiency, is an autosomal recessive condition resulting in inability to produce aldosterone. Our patient was treated with sodium supplementation and fludrocortisone.

Yousafzai, MD[1], Hirva Vyas, DO[2], Steve Kim, MD[3]; Bernard Kim, MD[4], Lucy M. Sa, DO[5] [1] Department of Internal Medicine, HUMC [2] Department Medicine, HUMC [3] Department of Cardiology, HUMC [4] Department of Pulmonary and Heart Failure, HUMC [5] Department of Cardiology, HUMC Case Summary: A 60 -year-old man with a history of diabetes presented with nausea and epigastric pain and was found to be in sustained ventricular tachycard ia requiring emergent cardioversion. Afterwards, an electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in the inferior leads and he was taken for cardiac catheterization. There he required placement of percutaneous right ventricular (RV) mechanical circulatory support device (Impella RP flex) to support his cardiogenic shock and acute RV failure. Angiogram found 100% mid RCA occlusion, 90% proximal LAD occlusion with collaterals to the RCA. Intervention on his RCA was unsuccessful thought to be a chronic total occlusion ; however, a drug -eluting stent was placed in the LAD. Initial transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed acute RV failure with a dilated and hypokinetic RV and mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function. Using fluoroscopy and TTE an Impella RP flex wa s guided into the right heart and across the pulmonic valve into the main pulmonary artery (PA). Next day follow up TTE images showed improved biventricular systolic function and the Impella RP flex was weaned. Acute right heart failure may lead to cardioge nic shock and emergent placement of Impella RP flex may be needed. The device is guided under fluoroscopy but TTE is usually the rst line imaging test ordered to conrm placement. It is important to assess the location of the inlet (usually in the right atr ium) and the outlet (in the main PA) of the device. The tip of the device is usually directed towards the left PA and a PA catheter positioned in the right PA. The Impella RP flex is easily visualized by TTE with turbulent flow by Doppler seen in the areas o f the inlet and outlet. Discussion/Conclusion: In cases of acute RV failure, placement of percutaneous RV mechanical circulatory support devices may be needed and TTE imaging is often ordered to help with guidance and conrms positioning.

It occurs when tumor cells trigger a coagulation cascade in the pulmonary artery vasculature leading to vessel hypertrophy and fibrosis. Subtypes include microembolism thrombotic micro angiopathy (PTTM), and tumor macroembolism. We present a patient with metastatic lung cancer who developed acute right ventricular heart failure with no sign of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), hypothesized to be tumoral pulmonary hypertension. Case Present ation: A 44 year -old female with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli on therapeutic enoxaparin, presented with worsening dyspnea and and tachypneic (31 respirations per minute) with accessory muscle use. Laboratory findings were remarkable for a troponin -I of 0.03 ng/mL pg/mL. Computed tomography angiogram was negative for acute PE. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a severely dilated with right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) of 87.9 mmHg, significantly worse than her TTE from one month prior (RVSP 46 .0 mmHg). Right heart catheterization revealed a cardiac output of 2.84L/min, pulmonary artery pulsatility index of 5.1, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 6 mmHg, and pulmonary vascular resistance of 12.7 dynes/sec/cm^5. Pulmonary angiogram was aborted due to elevated right atrial pressure. Despite treatment with intravenous (IV) anticoagulation, vasopressors and IV treprostinil, she developed worsening cardiogenic shock and died despite resuscitative efforts. Discussion: Tumoral PH should be suspected in patients with metastatic malignancy, particularly adenocarcinomas, who present with acute right ventricular failure in the setting of a negative PE study or persistent RV failure despite treatment with anticoagulation. CT A and a ventilation -perfusion scan may show multiple small filling defects therefore modalities that allow for sampling and analysis via cytology including pulmonary artery wedge aspirate, transbronchial biopsy or open lung biopsy are warranted for definit ive diagnosis. Due to rapid progression of cor pulmonale in these patients, aggressive management is necessary.
