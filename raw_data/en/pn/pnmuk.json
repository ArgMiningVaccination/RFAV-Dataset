Until we scale up those alternatives the world will continue to face two energy problems: hundreds of millions of people lack access to sufficient energy; and the dominance of fossil fuels in our energy system drives [climate change](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other), and other health impacts such as [air pollution](https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution). To make sure that everyone in the world has access to clean and safe energy, we need to understand energy consumption and its impacts around the world today and how this has changed over time. On this page you can find all our data, visualizations and writing relating to energy. Explore data on Energy Research & Writing [ The world's energy problem ](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem) The world faces two energy problems: most of our energy production still produces greenhouse gas emissions, and hundreds of millions lack access to energy entirely. Max Roser [ What are the safest and cleanest sources of energy? ](https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy) Fossil fuels are the dirtiest and most dangerous energy sources, while nuclear and modern renewable energy sources are vastly safer and cleaner. The differences are huge.
