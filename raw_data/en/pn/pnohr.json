They are in water and soil. They are on the surfaces of foods that we eat. They are also on surfaces that we touch, such as countertops in the bathroom or kitchen. Some bacteria live in and on our bodies and don't cause problems. Other kinds of bacteria (as well as parasites and viruses) can make us very sick if they get inside our bodies. Bacteria and viruses can live outside of the human body (such as on a countertop) sometimes for many hours or days. But parasites need a living host to survive. Bacteria and parasites can often be killed with antibiotics. But these medicines can't kill viruses. Children sick from a virus can be given medicines to make them feel better. But antibiotics don't fight viral infections. Bacteria, viruses, and parasites can cause many illnesses. They can infect any organ in the body. Viruses are often the cause of respiratory illnesses (such as the common cold) and digestive illnesses (such as diarrhea). Bacteria can infect any part of the body. But they often cause diarrhea when they get into the digestive tract. Diarrhea can be caused by many types of bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Children can also have diarrhea without having an infection. For example, diarrhea can be caused by food allergies or by certain medicines (such as antibiotics). A child has diarrhea when bowel movements are loose and watery, and more frequent than normal. Children with diarrhea may have other symptoms, such as: Nausea Vomiting Stomach aches Headache Fever By touching the stool of an infected person, such as when touching dirty diapers By touching an object contaminated with the stool of an infected person, and then eating the germs. This often happens by touching the mouth with the contaminated hand. This can occur at day-care centers or at home in places where diapered babies play. By eating or drinking contaminated food or water Viruses, bacteria, and parasites that get inside the digestive tract often cause diarrhea. Large amounts of water are lost with the diarrhea. This may cause dehydration in children. Children become dehydrated much quicker than adults. This can cause serious problems if fluids are not replaced. Infections caused by parasites and a few types of infections caused by bacteria may also need treatment with medicines. Also, children with a severely weakened immune system are at risk for more serious disease. Symptoms may be worse. They could lead to serious illness. People with weakened immune systems include those who: Have HIV/AIDS Have cancer or have had a transplant, and are taking certain immunosuppressive medicines Have inherited diseases that affect the immune system | | E. coli | | Description | | There are hundreds of different types, or strains, of the bacteria E. coli (Escherichia coli). Most of these are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But some strains of E. coli make a strong toxin that can cause a severe infection. The CDC recognizes E. colias a foodborne illness. This means it is spread by consuming contaminated food or drink. Infection often leads to bloody diarrhea, stomach cramps, vomiting, and fever. | | Transmission | | Most E. coliillness has been linked to eating undercooked, contaminated ground beef. E. coli bacteria live in the intestines of healthy cattle. The number of organisms required to cause disease is not known. But it is thought to be very small. Meat becomes contaminated during slaughter. Organisms can be mixed into beef when it is ground. Contaminated beef looks and smells normal. Other ways to transmit E. coli are: Bacteria in diarrhea stools of infected people can be passed from one person to another if hygiene or handwashing habits are not good. This is very likely among toddlers who are not toilet trained. Family members and playmates of these children are at high risk of getting infected. Young children often pass the organism in their stool for a week or 2 after their illness goes away. | | Prevention | | CDC recommends these steps to prevent the infection: | | Salmonella | | Description | | Salmonella is a bacteria that infects the intestines. It causes diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. Over 1 million cases of salmonella infection occur in the U.S. each year. The illness often lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people get better without treatment. But in some people, the diarrhea may be so severe that they need to stay in the hospital. In these people, the salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then to other body sites. It can cause death unless the person is treated right away with antibiotics. Babies and those with a weakened immune system are more likely to have a severe illness. | | Transmission | | Salmonella may be spread by: | | Prevention | | Don't eat raw or undercooked eggs, poultry, or meats. Remember that some sauces and desserts use raw eggs to make them. So be cautious of these, particularly in foreign countries. Also, follow these tips by the CDC: | | Rotavirus | | Description | | Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea among children. It results in the death of over 500,000 children each year worldwide. In the U.S., the disease occurs most often in the winter. Yearly epidemics occur from December to June. The highest rates of illness occur among infants and young children. Most children in the U.S. are infected by 5 years of age. Adults can also be infected. But the disease tends to be mild. The incubation period for rotavirus disease is about 2 days. The disease causes vomiting and watery diarrhea for 3 to 8 days. Fever and stomach pain occur often. Immunity after infection is incomplete. But repeat infections tend to be less severe than the original infection. | | Transmission | | Rotavirus may be spread: | | Prevention | | Two rotavirus vaccines are currently used in babies in the U.S. Both vaccines are given by mouth, not by a shot. Talk with your child's healthcare provider about which shot is best for your baby. Handwashing is a very important means of preventing the spread of rotavirus. Careful and frequent handwashing can prevent the spread of infection to other people. The CDC recommends: | | Giardia | | Description | | During the past 15 years, Giardia lambliahas become one of the most common waterborne diseases in humans in the U.S. Giardia is a tiny parasite that lives in the intestines of people and animals. The parasite is passed in the bowel movement of an infected person or animal. It is found in every part of the U.S. and throughout the world. Diaper-aged children who go to daycare centers, international travelers, hikers, campers, and others who drink untreated water from contaminated sources, are most at risk for getting infected with Giardia. Several community-wide outbreaks of infection have been linked to drinking municipal water tainted with Giardia. | | Transmission | | People become infected after accidentally swallowing the parasite. Giardia may be found in soil, food, water, or on surfaces. Some of the ways people can get Giardia are: | | Prevention | | The CDC recommends: If your child has Giardia, don't swim in pools for 2 weeks after the diarrhea or loose stools have cleared. Giardia is fairly chlorine resistant. It is passed in the stools of infected people for several weeks after they no longer have symptoms. | | Cryptosporidium | | Description | | Cryptosporidium, or \"crypto,\" is a tiny parasite that can live in the intestines of humans and animals. The parasite is protected by an outer shell that lets it survive outside the body for long periods of time. It is very resistant to chlorine disinfection. | | Transmission | | Cryptosporidium may be spread by: | | Prevention | | The CDC recommends: Almost everyone has had a foodborne illness at one time. These illnesses can happen when food is made at a restaurant or at home. If food is handled and prepared safely, most illnesses can be avoided. All food may have some natural bacteria. Not storing or handling ir right gives the bacteria a chance to grow. Food can also be contaminated with bacteria from other sources that can make you ill. Contaminated or unclean food can be very unsafe, especially to children. Each year, foodborne illnesses kill 3,000 people of all ages. They also cause fever, stomach cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea in about 48 million Americans. Be careful when buying food: When at the grocery store, pick up foods that can go bad (such as meat, eggs, and milk) at the very end of your shopping trip. This helps them stay cool. Take food home right away so that it does not spoil in a hot car. Stay away from raw or unpasteurized milk. Eggs, meat, seafood, and poultry are most likely to have bacteria. Don't let their juices drip on other food. Store food the right way: Store eggs, raw meat, poultry, and seafood in the refrigerator. A refrigerator should be set between 32\u00b0F and 40\u00b0F. A freezer should be set at or below 0\u00b0F. Regularly clean and disinfect your refrigerator and freezer. Use containers to prevent contaminating other foods or kitchen surfaces. Don't store food uncovered in the refrigerator or freezer. Use special precautions when preparing and cooking food: Wash your hands and clean and disinfect kitchen surfaces before, during, and after handling, cooking, and serving food. Defrost frozen food on a plate either in the refrigerator or in a microwave, but not on the counter. Cook food right away after defrosting. Use different dishes and utensils for raw foods than you use for cooked foods. Wash raw fruits and vegetables before eating them. Cool and promptly store leftovers after food has been served: Because harmful bacteria grow at room temperature, keep hot food hot and keep cold food cold. This is especially important during picnics and buffets. Do not leave foods that can go bad out for more than 2 hours. Promptly refrigerate or freeze leftovers in shallow containers or wrapped tightly in bags. "}
