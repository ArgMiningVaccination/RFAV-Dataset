DC/CFBC/EOC (R. EOC-22 BC (\"COB\"); SUBROGATION 6.1 Coordination of Benefits (\"COB\") A. Applicability 1. This Coordination of Benefits (COB) provision applies to this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan when a Member has health care coverage under more than one Plan. 2. If this COB provision applies, the Order of Benefit Determination Rules should be reviewed first. Those rules determine whether the benefits of this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan are determined before or after those of another Plan. The benefits of this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan: a. shall not be reduced when, under the order of determination rules, this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan determines its benefits before another Plan; b. may be reduced when, under the order of determination rules, another Plan determines its benefits first. The reduction is explained in Section 6.1.D.2. below. B. Definitions For the purpose of this COB section, the following terms are defined. The definitions of other capitalized terms are found in the definitions sections of this Evidence of Coverage. Allowable Expenses means any health care expense, including deductibles, coinsurance or copayments, that is covered in whole or in part by any of the Plans covering the Member. This means that any expense or portion of an expense that is not covered by any of the Plans is not an Allowable Expense. If this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan is advised by a Member that all Plans covering the Member are high-deductible health plans and the Member intends to contribute to a health savings account, the primary Plan's deductible is not an Allowable Expense, except for any health care expense incurred that may not be subject to the deductible as stated in Section 223(c)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. CareFirst BlueChoice Plan means this Evidence of Coverage. Intensive Care Policy means a health insurance policy that provides benefits only when treatment is received in that specifically designated health care facility of a hospital that provides the highest level of care and which is restricted to those patients who are physically, critically ill or injured. Plan means any health insurance policy, including those of nonprofit health service Plan, and those of commercial group, blanket, and individual policies, any subscriber contracts issued by health maintenance organizations, and any other established programs under which the insured may make a claim. The term Plan includes coverage under a governmental Plan, or coverage required or provided by law. This does not include a State Plan under Medicaid (Title XIX, Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs, of the United States Social Security Act, as amended from time to time.) The term Plan does not include: 1. An individually underwritten and issued, guaranteed renewable, specified disease policy; DC/CFBC/EOC (R. 6/09) EOC-23 BC HMO, BC-OA, BCOO-OA 2. A n intensive care policy, which does not provide benefits on an expense incurred basis; 3. Coverage regulated by a motor vehicle reparation law; 4. The first one-hundred dollars ($100) per day of a Hospital indemnity contract; or, 5. An elementary and or secondary school insurance program sponsored by a school or school system. Primary Plan or Secondary Plan means the order of benefit determination rules state whether this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan is a Primary Plan or Secondary Plan as to another Plan covering the Member. 1. When this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan is a Primary Plan, its benefits are determined before those of the other Plan and without considering the other Plan's benefits. 2. When this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan is a Secondary Plan, its benefits are determined after those of the other Plan and may be reduced because of the other Plan's benefits. 3. When there are more than two Plans covering the Member, this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan may be a Primary Plan as to one of the other Plans, and may be a Secondary Plan as to a different Plan or Plans. Specified Disease Policy means a health insurance policy that provides (1) benefits only for a disease or diseases specified in the policy or for the treatment unique to a specific disease; or (2) additional benefits for a disease or diseases specified in the policy or for treatment unique to a specified disease or diseases. C. Order of Determination Rules 1. General When there is a basis for a claim under this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan and another Plan, this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan is a Secondary Plan which has its benefits determined after those of the other Plan, unless; a. The other Plan has rules coordinating benefits with those of this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan; and b. Both those rules and this BlueChoice Plan's rules require that this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan's benefits be determined before those of the other Plan. 2. Rules This CareFirst BlueChoice Plan determines its order of benefits using the first of the following rules which applies: a. Non-dependent/dependent. The benefits of the Plan which covers the person as an employee, member or subscriber (that is, other than as a dependent) are determined before those of the Plan which covers the person as a dependent; except that if the person is also a Medicare beneficiary, and the result of the rule established by Title XVIII of the DC/CFBC/EOC (R. 6/09) EOC-24 BC HMO, BC-OA, BCOO-OA Social Security Act and implementing regulations, Medicare is: i. S econdary to the Plan covering the person as a dependent, and ii. Primary to the Plan covering the person as other than a dependent (e.g. retired employee), Then the benefits of the Plan covering the person as a dependent are determined before those of the Plan covering the person as other than a dependent. b. Dependent child covered by more than one Plan. Unless there is a court decree stating otherwise, when this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan and another Plan cover the same child as a dependent, the order of benefits shall be determined as follows: i. For a dependent child whose parents are married or are living together: 1) The benefits of the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in a year are determined before those of the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls later in the year; but 2) If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the Plan that covered one parent longer are determined before those of the Plan that covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. ii. For a dependent child whose parents are separated, divorced, or are not living together: 1) If the specific terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the child, and the entity obligated to pay or provide the benefits of the Plan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, the benefits of that Plan are determined first. If the parent with responsibility has no health care coverage for the dependent child's health care expenses, but the parent's Spouse does, that parent's Spouse's Plan is the primary Plan. This paragraph does not apply with respect to any claim for services rendered before the entity has that actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree. The rule described in 1) also shall apply if: (i) a court decree states that both parents are responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage or (ii) a court decree states that the parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or coverage of the dependent child. 2) If there is no court decree setting out the responsibility for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the dependent child are as follows: a) The Plan of the parent with custody of the child; DC/CFBC/EOC (R. 6/09) EOC-25 BC HMO, BC-OA, BCOO-OA b) The Plan of the Spouse of the parent with the custody of the child; c) The Plan of the parent not having custody of the child; and then d) The Plan of the Spouse of the parent who does not have custody of the child. iii. For a dependent child covered under more than one Plan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the order of benefits shall be determined, as applicable, under the rules stated in 1) and 2) of this paragraph as if those individuals where parents of the child. c. Active/inactive employee. The benefit of a Plan which covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired is determined before those of a Plan which covers that person as a laid off or retired employee. The same would hold true if a person is a dependent of a person covered as a retiree and an employee. If the other Plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. d. Continuation coverage. If a person whose coverage is provided under the right of continuation pursuant to Federal or State law also is covered under another Plan, the following shall be the order of benefits determination: i. First, the benefits of a Plan covering the person as an employee, member or Subscriber (or as that person's dependent); ii. Second, the benefits under the continuation coverage. If the other Plan does not have the rule described above, and if, as a result, the Plans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. e. Longer/shorter length of coverage. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the benefits of the Plan that covered an employee, member or subscriber longer are determined before those of the Plan that covered that person for the shorter term. D. Effect on the Benefits of this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan 1. When this Section Applies This section applies when, in accordance with the prior section, Order of Determination Rules, this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan is a Secondary Plan as to one or more other Plans. In that event the benefits of this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan may be reduced under this section. Such other Plan or Plans are referred to as \"the other Plans\" immediately below. 2. Reduction in this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan's Benefits When this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan is the Secondary Plan, the benefits under this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan may be reduced so that the total benefits that would be payable or provided by all the other Plans do not exceed one hundred DC/CFBC/EOC (R. 6/09) EOC-26 BC HMO, BC-OA, BCOO-OA percent (100%) of the total Allowable Expenses. If the benefits of this CareFirst Blu eChoice Plan are reduced, each benefit is reduced in proportion. It is then charged against any applicable benefit limit of this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan. E. Right to Receive and Release Needed Information Certain facts are needed to apply these COB rules. CareFirst BlueChoice has the right to decide which facts it needs. It may get the needed facts from or give them to any other organization or person for purposes of treatment, payment, and health care operations. CareFirst BlueChoice need not tell, or get the consent of, any person to do this. Each person claiming benefits under this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan must give this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan any facts it needs to pay the claim. F. Facility of Payment A payment made under another Plan may include an amount that should have been paid under this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan. If it does, this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. That amount will then be treated as though it were a benefit paid under this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan. This CareFirst BlueChoice Plan will not have to pay that amount again. The term \"payment made\" includes providing benefits in the form of services, in which case \"payment made\" means the reasonable cash value of the benefits provided in the form of services. G. Right of Recovery If the amount of the payments made by this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan is more that it should have paid under this COB provision, it may recover the excess from one or more of: 1. The persons it has paid or for whom it has paid, 2. Insurance companies, or, 3. Other organizations. The \"amount of the payments made\" includes the reasonable cash value of any benefits provided in the form of services. 6.2 Medicare Eligibility This provision applies to Members who are enrolled in Part A and/or Part B of Medicare. A Member will not be terminated as a result of reaching the age of 65 or becoming eligible for Medicare. Benefits not covered by Medicare will be provided as described in the Evidence of Coverage. Benefits that are covered by Medicare are subject to the provisions in this section. A. Coverage Secondary to Medicare Except where prohibited by law, the benefits under this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan are secondary to Medicare. B. Medicare as Primary 1. When benefits for Covered Services are paid by Medicare as primary, this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan will not duplicate those payments. When CareFirst BlueChoice coordinates the benefits with Medicare, CareFirst BlueChoice's payments will be based on the Medicare allowance (if the provider is a participating provider in Medicare) or the Medicare maximum limiting charge (if the provider is not a participating provider in Medicare). DC/CFBC/EOC (R. 6/09) EOC-27 BC under this CareFirst BlueChoice Plan will be coordinated as described above to the extent a benefit would have been provided or payable under Medicare if the Member had diligently sought to establish his or her right to such benefits. Members shall agree to complete and submit to Medicare, CareFirst BlueChoice and/or Contracting Providers all claims, consents, releases, assignments and other documents required to obtain or assure such payment. 6.3 Subrogation CareFirst BlueChoice has subrogation and reimbursement rights. Subrogation requires the Member to turn over to CareFirst BlueChoice any rights the Member may have against a third party. A third party is any person, corporation, insurer or other entity that may be liable to a Member for an injury or illness. This right applies to the amount of benefits paid by CareFirst BlueChoice for injuries or illnesses where a third party could be liable. Recovery means to be successful in a lawsuit, to collect or obtain an amount; to obtain a favorable or final judgment; to obtain an amount in any legal manner; an amount finally collected or the amount of judgment as a result of an action brought against a third-party or involving uninsured or underinsured motorist claims. A Recovery does not include payments made to the Member under the Member's personal injury protection policy. CareFirst BlueChoice will not recover medical expenses from a Subscriber unless the Subscriber or Member recovers for medical expenses in a cause of action. A. The Member shall notify CareFirst BlueChoice as soon as reasonably possible that a third-party may be liable for the injuries or illnesses for which benefits are being provided or paid. B. To the extent that actual payments made by CareFirst BlueChoice result from the occurrence that gave rise to the cause of action, CareFirst BlueChoice shall be subrogated and succeed to any right of recovery of the Member against any person or organization. C. The Member shall pay CareFirst BlueChoice the amount recovered by suit, settlement, or otherwise from any third-party's insurer, any uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, or as permitted by law, to the extent that any actual payments made by CareFirst BlueChoice result from the occurrence that gave rise to the cause of action. D. The Member shall furnish information and assistance, and execute papers that CareFirst BlueChoice may require to facilitate enforcement of these rights. The Member shall not commit any action prejudicing the rights and interests of CareFirst BlueChoice. E. In a subrogation claim arising out of a claim for personal injury, the amount recovered by CareFirst BlueChoice may be reduced by: 1. Dividing the total amount of the personal injury recovery into the total amount of the attorney's fees incurred by the injured person for services rendered in connection with the injured person's claim; and 2. Multiplying the result by the amount of CareFirst BlueChoice's subrogation claim. This percentage may not exceed one-third (1/3) of CareFirst BlueChoice's subrogation claim. F. On written request by CareFirst BlueChoice, a Member or Member's attorney who demands a reduction of the subrogation claim shall provide CareFirst BlueChoice with a certification by the Member that states the amount of the attorney's fees incurred. G. These provisions do not apply to residents of the Commonwealth of Virginia. DC/CFBC/EOC (R. 6/09) EOC-28 BC HMO, BC-OA, BCOO-OA SEC TION 7 GENERAL PROVISIONS 7.1 Claims Submission and Payment A. Claims Forms 1. CareFirst BlueChoice does not require a written notice of a claim. A Member may request a claims form by writing or calling CareFirst BlueChoice.

When a Dependent child subject to a Medical Child Support Order or a Qualified Medical Support Order does not reside with the Subscriber, CareFirst BlueChoice will: a.

Allow the non-insuring, custodial parent or a provider of a Covered Service to submit a claim without the approval of the Subscriber; c. Provide benefits directly to: i. The non-insuring, custodial parent; ii. The provider of the Covered Services; or iii. The appropriate child support enforcement agency of any State or the District of Columbia. B. Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be furnished to CareFirst BlueChoice within 180 days after the date of the loss. Failure to furnish proof within the time required shall not invalidate or reduce any claim if it was not reasonably possible to give proof within the required time, provided proof is furnished as soon as reasonably possible and in no event, except in the absence of legal capacity, later than one (1) year from the time proof is otherwise required. CareFirst BlueChoice will honor claims submitted for Covered Services by any agency of the federal, state or local government that has the statutory authority to submit claims beyond the time limits established under this Evidence of Coverage. These claims must be submitted to CareFirst BlueChoice before the filing deadline established by the applicable statute on claims forms that provide all of the information CareFirst BlueChoice deems necessary to process the claims. CareFirst BlueChoice provides forms for this purpose. C. Time of Payment of Claims . Benefits payable under this Evidence of Coverage will be paid within thirty (30) days after receipt of written proof of loss. DC/CFBC/EOC (R. 6/09) EOC-29 BC HMO, BC-OA, BCOO-OA Payments Made in Error. If CareFirst BlueChoice makes a claim payment to or on behalf of a Member in error, the Member is required to repay CareFirst BlueChoice the amount that was paid in error. If the Member has not repaid the full amount owed CareFirst BlueChoice and CareFirst BlueChoice makes a subsequent benefit payment, CareFirst BlueChoice may subtract the amount owed CareFirst BlueChoice from the subsequent payment. 7.2 Payment of Claims . Payments for Covered Services will be made by CareFirst BlueChoice directly to Contracting Physicians and Contracting Providers. If a Member receives Covered Services from Non-Contracting Providers, CareFirst BlueChoice reserves the right to pay either the Member or the provider and such payment shall, in either case, constitute full and complete satisfaction of CareFirst BlueChoice's obligation. If the Member has paid the health care provider for services rendered, benefits will be payable to the Member. 7.3 Legal Actions . A Member cannot bring any lawsuit against CareFirst BlueChoice to recover under this Evidence of Coverage before the expiration of sixty (60) days after written proof of loss has been furnished, and not after three (3) years from the date that written proof of loss is required to be submitted to CareFirst BlueChoice. 7.4 Delivery of Evidence of Coverage . Unless CareFirst BlueChoice makes delivery directly to the Member, CareFirst BlueChoice will provide to the Group, for delivery to each Member, a statement that summarizes the essential features of the coverage and indicates to whom benefits under the Evidence of Coverage are payable. Only one statement will be issued for each family unit, except in the instance of an eligible child who is covered due to a MCSO/QMSO. In that instance, an additional Evidence of Coverage will be delivered to the custodial parent, upon request. 7.5 No Assignment . A Member cannot assign any benefits or payments due under the Evidence of Coverage to any person, corporation or other organization, except as specifically provided by this Evidence of Coverage or as required by law. A. When a Member receives Medically Necessary ambulance services from a Non- Contracting ambulance services provider, CareFirst BlueChoice will issue payment directly to the Member. However, for these providers, the Member may elect to assign benefits to the person providing such services by notifying CareFirst BlueChoice in writing of the assignment. Prior authorization of the ambulance services is not required. For the purposes of this section, ambulance service means the transportation of any person requiring resuscitation or emergency relief or where human life is endangered. B. The Member may elect to assign benefits for Medically Necessary Covered Services to non-participating dentists or non-participating oral surgeons providing such services by notifying CareFirst BlueChoice in writing of the assignment. C. CareFirst BlueChoice must be presented with the assignment of benefits in writing. Any assignment by the Member that does not comply with the terms as stated above will be void. 7.6 Events outside of the CareFirst BlueChoice's Control . A. An event outside of the control of CareFirst BlueChoice refers to a natural disaster, epidemic, complete or partial destruction of facilities, disability of a significant part of CareFirst BlueChoice or Contracting Provider staff, war (whether declared or not), riot, civil insurrection or any similar event over which CareFirst BlueChoice cannot exercise influence or control. B. When an event outside the control of CareFirst BlueChoice affects the operations of CareFirst BlueChoice or EOC-30 BC HMO, BC-OA, BCOO-OA Providers will use their best efforts to continue to provide and arrange benefits and ser vices to Members under this Evidence of Coverage, taking into account the impact of the event on facilities and personnel and the extent to which the services required by the Member are Medically Necessary and urgently needed. C. If CareFirst BlueChoice and Contracting Providers are unable to provide or arrange benefits under Section 7.6.B in a reasonable manner and within a reasonable time of the Member's request, coverage will be provided for Covered Services obtained from any physician, Hospital or provider of the Member's choice.

DEFINITIONS B. BENEFIT DETERMINATIONS C. INTERNAL GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE D. FAIR AND FULL REVIEW E. DEEMED EXHAUSTION OF INTERNAL CLAIMS AND APPEAL PROCESS F. EXTERNAL APPEAL PROCEDURE A. DEFINITIONS Adverse Benefit Determination means, as used in this attachment, the following: 1. A denial, reduction, or termination of, or a failure to provide or make payment (in whole or in part) for, a benefit, including any such denial, reduction, termination, or failure to provide or make payment that is based on a determination of a Member's eligibility to participate in this plan. An Adverse Benefit Determination includes a Rescission. 2. A denial, reduction, or termination of, or a failure to provide or make payment (in whole or in part) for, a benefit resulting from the application of any utilization review, as well as a failure to cover an item or service for which benefits are otherwise provided because it is determined to be Cosmetic, Experimental or Investigational, or not Medically Necessary or appropriate. Health Care Provider means a physician or other health care professional licensed, accredited, or certified to perform specified health services consistent with State law. Pre-Service Claim means any claim for a benefit when the receipt of the benefit, in whole or in part, is conditioned on the prior approval of the service in advance by CareFirst BlueChoice.

Could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the Member or the ability of the Member to regain maximum function; or, 2. In the opinion of a Health Care Provider with knowledge of the Member's medical condition, would subject the Member to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the claim. Whether a claim involves Urgent/Emergent Care is to be determined by an individual acting on behalf of CareFirst BlueChoice applying the judgment of a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine.

E. DEEMED EXHAUSTION OF INTERNAL CLAIMS AND APPEAL PROCESS In the case of a plan that fails to adhere to the minimum requirements for employee benefit plan procedures relating to Claims for Benefits, the Member is deemed to have exhausted the internal claims and appeals processes of paragraph C and D herein.

DC/BC-OOP/SOB (R. 6/09) C-7 Option 13 Member First Street, NE Was hington, DC 20065 202-479-8000 An independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association INTER-PLAN ARRANGEMENTS DISCLOSURE AMENDMENT This amendment is effective on the effective date of the Evidence of Coverage to which this amendment is attached. Out-of-Area Services CareFirst BlueChoice has a variety of relationships with other Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Plans and their Licensed Controlled Affiliates (\"Licensees\") referred to generally as \"Inter-Plan Programs.\" Whenever Members obtain Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services outside of the CareFirst BlueChoice Service Area, the claims for these services may be processed through one of these Inter-Plan Programs. Typically, when accessing care outside the CareFirst BlueChoice Service Area, Members will obtain care from healthcare providers that have a contractual agreement (i.e., are \"participating providers\" or \"contracted providers\") with the local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Licensee in that other geographic area (\"Host Blue\"). In some instances, Members may obtain care from non-participating healthcare providers. CareFirst BlueChoice payment practices in both instances are described below. CareFirst BlueChoice covers only limited healthcare services received outside of its Service Area. As used in this amendment \"Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services\" means: 1. Emergency Services; 2. Urgent Care; 3. Follow-up care after emergency surgery for services provided by the physician, surgeon, oral surgeon, periodontist, or podiatrist who performed the surgical procedure, for follow-up care that is Medically Necessary, directly related to the condition for which the surgical procedure was performed and provided in consultation with the Member's Primary Care Physician; obtained outside the geographic area CareFirst BlueChoice serves. Any other services will not be covered when processed through any Inter-Plan Programs arrangements unless authorized by your primary care physician (\"PCP\") . A. BlueCard\u00ae Program Under the BlueCard\u00ae Program, when Members obtain Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services from a provider within the geographic area served by a Host Blue, CareFirst BlueChoice will remain responsible for fulfilling its contractual obligations. However the Host Blue is responsible for contracting with and generally handling all interactions with its participating healthcare providers. The BlueCard Program enables Members to obtain Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services, as defined above, from a healthcare provider participating with a Host Blue, where available. The participating healthcare provider will automatically file a claim for the Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services provided to the Member, so there are no claim forms for the Member to fill out. Members will be responsible for the Member payment amount, as stated in the Evidence of Coverage. DC/CFBC/MEM/BLCRD (1/12) 2 Member HMO Emergency Care Services: A M e mber requiring Emergency Services while traveling outside the CareFirst BlueChoice Service Area should go to the nearest emergency or Urgent Care facility. Whenever a Member accesses Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services and the claim is processed through the BlueCard Program, the amount the Member pays for Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services, if not a flat dollar copayment, is calculated based on the lower of: The billed covered charges for the Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services; or The negotiated price that the Host Blue makes available to CareFirst BlueChoice. Often, this \"negotiated price\" will be a simple discount that reflects an actual price that the Host Blue pays to the healthcare provider. Sometimes, it is an estimated price that takes into account special arrangements with the healthcare provider or provider group that may include types of settlements, incentive payments, and/or other credits or charges. Occasionally, it may be an average price, based on a discount that results in expected average savings for similar types of healthcare providers after taking into account the same types of transactions as with an estimated price. Estimated pricing and average pricing, going forward, also take into account adjustments to correct for over- or underestimation of modifications of past pricing for the types of transaction modifications noted above. However, such adjustments will not affect the price CareFirst BlueChoice uses for a claim because they will not be applied retroactively to claims already paid. Laws in a small number of states may require the Host Blue to add a surcharge to the calculation. If any state laws mandate other liability calculation methods, including a surcharge, CareFirst BlueChoice would then calculate Member liability for any Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services according to applicable law. B. Non-Participating Healthcare Providers Outside the CareFirst BlueChoice Service Area Member Liability Calculation: When Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services are received from non-participating healthcare providers, the amount the Member pays for such services will generally be based on either the Host Blue's non-participating healthcare provider local payment or the pricing arrangements required by applicable law. In any case, the Member will only be liable for any Deductible or Copayment for the Out-of-Area Covered Healthcare Services as set forth in the Evidence of Coverage. This amendment is subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Evidence of Coverage to which it is attached and does not change any terms or conditions, except as specifically stated herein.

If the Subscriber does not attempt to enroll the child, then CareFirst BlueChoice will accept enrollment from the non-Subscriber custodial parent; or, the appropriate child support enforcement agency of any State or the District of Columbia. If the Subscriber has not completed any applicable waiting periods for coverage, the child will not be enrolled until the end of the waiting period. The Subscriber must be enrolled under this Group Contract in order for the child to be enrolled.
