According to traditional Chinese medicinal theory, our organ systems correspond to the rhythms of nature and seasons - and spring is the prime time to look after liver. David Tu - a registered acupuncturist and Chinese Medicine Practitioner from China, and also a registered Chinese Herbalist for 30 years, said that spring correlates with the element of wood that governs the liver and gallbladder meridians. \"Imbalances of this meridian may manifest as spinal problems anxiety, poor flexibility, arthritis, headache, neck pain, allergies, eye problems and indigestion,\" he said. \"In traditional Chinese medicine, the liver is in charge of moving qi (energy) throughout the body. When the liver cannot move the body's qi, people tend to feel depressed, or even agitated, in addition with having digestive difficulties.\" \"The emotion most closely tied with the liver, and the quality of the spring, is the explosive nature of anger. You may find yourself becoming easily angered over trivial matters.\" \"The liver is the seat of emotions; so stagnant, blocked liver qi may also lead to indecision, irritability, feelings of weak-rootedness, or anxiety.\" Mr Tu describes springtime as \"liver time\" - a time of cleansing by nourishing and supporting the liver. \"This is a time that we can support our liver's functions through key nutrition, herbs and acupuncture.\" Mr Tu also said the stagnation of the liver meridian could be balanced with acupuncture and Chinese herbal formulae, along with outdoor exercises and eating vegetables, in order to harmonize and activate smooth liver qi. \"Chinese acupuncture is a way to help during this natural time of cleansing and detoxification,\" he said. \"It settles the liver so that it can do its many tasks more efficiently.\" \"Using acupuncture as a support during detox and drainage is beneficial, since acupuncture works on strengthening the organs of elimination whilst moving anything that is anti-beneficial out of the body.\" Herbal medicine is another way to help nourish the liver and restore it to optimal functionality. \"Some of the benefits of springtime cleansing are: clarity of mind, higher levels of energy and endurance, improved skin and complexion, better digestion, emotional stability and weight loss.\" Be good to your liver this spring by seeing our practitioners for acupuncture and nutritional support at Diamond Bridge Clinics.
