Chiropractors practice a manual approach, providing diagnosis, treatment and preventive care for disorders related to the spine, pelvis, nervous system and joints. Chiropractors use a combination of treatments, all of which are predicated on the specific needs of the individual patient. After taking a complete history and diagnosing a patient, a chiropractor can develop and carry out a comprehensive treatment/management plan, recommend therapeutic exercise and other non-invasive therapies, and provide nutritional, dietary and lifestyle counselling. For many conditions, such as lower back pain, chiropractic care is frequently the primary method of treatment. Where other conditions exist, chiropractic care may complement or support medical treatment by relieving the musculoskeletal aspects associated with the condition. Chiropractic care may also be used to provide symptomatic relief for patients with chronic conditions. According to patient surveys, by treating the musculoskeletal elements of such disorders, chiropractic treatment has been shown to improve the general well-being of the patient. There are many reasons to seek chiropractic care: Back pain Neck pain Headache Whiplash Strains and sprains Repetitive strain injury (RSI) Sports injuries Arthritis Limited range of motion in the back, shoulder, neck or limbs General health and well-being Chiropractic is a regulated health profession, recognized by statute in all Canadian provinces and American states. Almost 2 million patients in Ontario rely on chiropractic care every year to help them live healthy, active lives. Physiotherapy [Read More](7-description) Physiotherapists are health care practitioners that help people affected by injury, illness or disability through movement and exercise, manual therapy, education and advice. They maintain health for people of all ages, helping patients to manage pain and prevent reoccurring injury. A physiotherapist undergoes on average 5 years of an undergraduate degree and a 2-year Master's Degree in Physiotherapy. Throughout their profession, they will take courses to expand their knowledge and treatment techniques. In a typical physiotherapy assessment, the physiotherapist will ask the patient the history of their physical conditions, current symptoms, and any other relevant information for what they are coming in for. From there, the physiotherapist assesses the patients' movement in varying positions such as standing, sitting and lying down. This can be done with the patient doing the movements themselves, or the physiotherapist moving the patient passively. Once the physiotherapist has assessed the patient's movement, associated pain and strength, they will begin hands-on treatment with such techniques as manual therapy, Active Release Technique or soft tissue release, and strengthening. If a patient's injury or pain is too acute, modalities such as TENS, heat, ice or therapeutic laser can be used to help symptoms and healing. Throughout or at the end of the session the patient will be educated on their diagnosis of injury and be prescribed advice and certain physical exercises for the patient to do for homework in order to start resolving the mechanical problems. Assessing the problem, not the pain. At Orillia Synergy Healthcare, our physiotherapist assesses the patients' movements and strengths to assess not just WHERE the pain is coming from, but WHY they are getting pain in the first place. Pain normally arises because improper movement patterns cause joints to move poorly above or below the place of injury. In order to resolve the pain, treatment needs to be focused on areas around the painful site.

Naturopathic medicine uses a wide variety of therapies to treat, support and uncover the root cause of patient health concerns. The focus of naturopathic care is centered on the individual, their current health (physical, emotional and spiritual), family history as well as lifestyle choices all of which informs the diagnosis and treatment plan offered by a naturopathic doctor. The philosophy of naturopathic medicine is to work with the patient to stimulate the healing power of the body and treat the underlying cause of disease. In naturopathic medicine symptoms of disease are seen as warning signals of improper functioning of the body, and lifestyle habits that may interfere with your optimal level of health. Think of it as your gateway to optimal health. From diet and exercise, to understanding your body's unique chemistry, naturopathic medicine allows you to boost your immune system, prevent and treat chronic disease and increase your overall energy level. Naturopathic treatment draws from a number of modalities and is tailored to the individual. Depending on the doctor's approach and the needs of the individual patient, treatments may include clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathic medicine, physical treatments, acupuncture and Asian medicine, lifestyle counselling, or a combination of these. Acupuncture [Read More](1-description) Contemporary Medical Acupuncture is a precise peripheral nerve stimulation technique, in which fine solid needles (acupuncture needles) are inserted into anatomically defined neurofunctional sites, and stimulated manually or with electricity for the therapeutic purpose of modulating abnormal activity of the nervous system and/or the endocrine, exocrine and immune systems, in pain syndromes, functional problems, and any diseases in which these modulatory mechanisms are available. Neuromodulation occurs through neurological and neurohumoral mechanisms at multiple levels, namely: peripheral nerves, spinal cord, brain stem, brain and cerebellum.
