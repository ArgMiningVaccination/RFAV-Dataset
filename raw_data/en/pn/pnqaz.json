THE COMMITTEE In 1998, under the Authority 42USC 294F, Section 756 of the Public Health Service Act, the Advisory Committee on Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Linkages (ACICBL) was created. The Co mmittee has specific duties to include providing advice and recommendations to the Secretary concerning policy and program development and other matters of significance concerning activities under Section 756, Title VII, Part D of the Public Health Service Act. Additionally, the Committee prepares and su bmits a report to the Secretary; the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of the Senate; and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of th e House of Representatives that describes its activities, findings, and re commendations. Specifically, Section 756 directs that: The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services shall establish an advisory committee, known as the Advisory Committee on Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Linkages (ACICBL). The Secretary shall appoin t the members of the Co mmittee from a pool of qualified applicants who are health professionals from schools of the types described in Sections 751 thro ugh 755, inclusive of Area Health Education Centers; Geriatric Training for Physicians, Dentists, and Behavioral/Mental Health Professional s; Quentin N. Burdick Program for Rural Interdisciplinary Training; and Allied Health and Other Disciplines. The Secretary shall ensure a fair balance between the health professions. At least 75 percent of the appointmen ts shall be health professionals representing a broad geographic spectrum, a balance between urban and rural members, and an adequate representation of women and minorities. The Secretary shall ensure the appo intment of members based on their competence, interest, and knowledge of the mission of the professions involved. The Health Resources and Services Admi nistration (HRSA); Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr); Division of State, Community, and Public Health has responsibility for managing all aspects of this Committee. The Committee is legislatively mandated to convene at least three times annually to discuss relevant issues that impact the Title VII training programs and associated research. Frequently, this effort invo lves convening experts and consultants from the field for dialogue with the public always being invited. The Committee was initially chartered on March 24, 1999. The charter was renewed on March 22, 2001; March 23, 2003; March 1, 2005; and March 23, 2007. 1 Members of the ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON INTERDISCIPLINARY, COMMUNITY- BASED LINKAGES Alan Adams, DC Vice President Academics and Program Development Texas Chiropractic College Pasadena, Texas Program: Chiropractic Medicine Mary Amundson, MA Assistant Professor University of North Dakota/School of Medical and Health Sciences Center for Rural Health Grand Fork, North Dakota Program: Rural Health Heather Karr Anderson, MPH Grants Administrator East Tennessee State University Johnson City, Tennessee Program: Health Education Training Centers (HETC) Jeremy Boal, MD Medical Director Long Island Jewish Hospital Medical Center New Hyde Park, New York Program: Geriatric Academic Career Awards (GACA) Hugh W.

The Committee recognizes that the services offered to the respective communi ties are invaluable to the training and development of the country's health care workforce and affect the Nation's entire health care system as a whole. To assi st in this growth and development, the Committee provides recommendations on pertinent topics related to these programs. In alignment with its Fe deral mandate, the Committee provides advice and recommendations to the Secret ary of the Department of Health and Human Services concerning policy and program development and other related matters of significance. Accordingly, the Committee recognized the tremendous impact of new technology on the health care delivery system and consequently, the strategies employed to educate health care profe ssionals. In 2007, the Committee focused its efforts on obtaining a deeper understa nding specific to the use of technology on the advancement of interdisciplinary health care related pursuits. The Committee determined that the advances with Health Information Technology (HIT) and the widespread use of the El ectronic Health Record (EHR) were the most pertinent issues associated with the programs represented by the members of the Committee. In turn, the Committee worked toward gaining insight on the developments related to both the challenges and opportunities of HIT and EHR faced by health care professionals with the goal of prov iding meaningful advice to the Secretary and the Congress. A secondary objective of the Committee was to provide the leadership of the various training prog rams with beneficial information related to HIT and EHR based on varied experien ces from the users in the field. As such, the Committee formulated edif ying recommendations on how various aspects of the Nation's health care syst em can best move forward in preparation for the increasing utilization of HIT and EHR. The Committee's findings and suggestions are addressed to the Secret ary and the Congress with the goals of further dissemination and implementation of the recommendations to advance the positive outcomes of the various t raining programs that it represents. 7 The importance of outcome data in evaluating performance and determining funding in the health care domain w ill demand that data be collected and analyzed in a systematic and thorough manner. Health Information Technology and the Electronic Health Record offer the prospect of making those processes more complete, concise, and consistent. Furthermore, clinical research in support of evidence-based practices will increasingly require the capacity to accumulate and manipulate large volume s of patient care data, demanding the analytical abilities that only EHR and HIT can offer. Broad-based use of the EHR promises enhanced education of all heal th professionals and will contribute to studies of the effectiveness of interdisciplinary training and team functioning. Improvement in quality of care is widely believed to be an end result of these developments. The need for all health care personnel to be able to effectively interact with and use HIT for both patient care and research will increasingly become important as the EHR is adopted throughout the health care system in the United Sates. The Committee received testimony from an impr essive array of national experts who are leading the way in the implementation of the EHR. Among that data, it was noted that 13 percent of health centers, 11 percent of hospitals, and 9 percent of ambulatory health care settings have al ready implemented some form of EHR. These figures are expected to rise rapidly , despite the negative pressures of costs and training requirements because of the perceived benefits to patient care and clinical research. The American Health Information Management Association and the American Medical Informatics Association are developing specific basic HIT competencies for the health care workforce as other groups are seeing the need for a common knowledge base. Professional silos are no longer acceptable when communications focus on the individual patient. A 2003 Report from the Institute of Medicine, (Health Profe ssions Education: A Bridge to Quality ) cited the need for skills in informatics to be considered as an overarching competency to be taught to health professions stud ents and trainees. How that competency will be included in the various health professions curricula remains a challenge, but interdisciplinary, community-based training sites are poised and situated to play a major role. The Committee heard testimony regarding the success of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in re-allocating resources to successfully implement an EHR within its health care facilities. Many non-VA centers that provide education and training for health care personnel, including Community Health Centers (HCs) and many interdisciplin ary, community-based activities funded through Title VII programs lack the resources to implement HIT systems and the associated training support. 8 Since EHR systems are not typically suppo rted through clinical or educational budget lines, additional funding may be needed to bring grantees to a useful standard and to maintain that posture thro ugh the foreseeable life-cycle of HIT. Safety-net providers (such as HCs) are independent entities with fewer resources and are among those most in need of assi stance, both technical and financial, in the implementation of HIT and EHR. Currently, HRSA grant funds are not targeted toward HIT/EHR capacity- building and training, but the establis hment of a HRSA Office of Health Information Technology is a step in the ri ght direction for the Agency. Available EHR systems lack features of interope rability and universality, thus training tends to be isolated to one particular syst em. If these important features are not incorporated as part of future system s, EHR skills may not be directly transferable to other health care setting s. Linkages of vendor-supplied systems to other systems is not a feature of most packages, nor are many systems planned around the information needs of clinicians (as opposed to administrators). Additionally, the clinical communication component of systems may not have the ability to incorporate information directly from the patient into the record, an element increasingly recognized as a best practice in care decisions. In order to assist with the transition to EHR, there is a need to prepare a new health care professional, one who is dually-trained in both a traditional health profession (including an allied health profession) an d in HIT. These individuals will have knowledge in the utilization of HIT an d EHR systems, as well as possess the sensitivity to the issues and needs surroun ding the patient with in the health care system. Not every facility or interd isciplinary, community-based entity will need to have such experts on staff, but these individuals could serve as technical consultants in the training of faculty or even vendors to cover multiple sites. A major concern of the Committee is the provision of a qualified health care workforce and an integral part of that concern is the education and training of health care personnel. It follows that faculty must be available in sufficient quantity and quality. Yet there is clear ev idence that the health professions will suffer from a lack of qualified prof essionals who choose to prepare for an academic career. The Committee receiv ed testimony, and discussed at some length, the necessity of new and cr eative support mechanisms for the development of faculty, especially from within the health professions themselves. The issue extends beyond the topic of HIT. Whether through new programs or existi ng ones, there must be a concerted effort to grow the next generation of health professionals in allied health professions or in those further described in Title VII legislation (e.g., psychology, chiropractic, podiatry). One model is the Geriatric Academic Career Awards 9 Program that offers direct salary support. Extending the concept to interdisciplinary faculty development might also lead to new fellowships, master teachers or other new positions within the f ramework of clinician, researcher, and educator. Other mechanisms might be loan repayment for teachers and the expansion of the National Health Servic e Corps to include additional health professions. Another well-recognized issue with HI T and the EHR relates to privacy, confidentiality, and the ethi cal control of personal he alth data. These matters must be included in all education and trai ning and at all levels of patient care and in research settings. Technical capability aside, equipment and procedures associated with EHR must consider the pr otections that are assured by both legal requirements and by strong traditions. The Committee understands that other ad visory committees are grappling with similar issues and concerns. These discu ssions and considerations should not occur in a vacuum, but in the spirit and context of interdisciplinary collaboration to the ultimate benefit of those wh om the programs represented by the Committee must serve. In an era of declining resources, the Committee developed significant and practical recommendations in response to the findings presented in the testimonies from experts in urban and rural settings who embody the growing and diverse populations and geographical areas of the country. 10 THE RECOMMENDATIONS THE SECRETARY AND THE CONGRESS 1. The ACICBL recommends that the Secretary support and the Congress authorize and fund a new Interdisciplin ary Faculty Development Program for Title VII Section 750 programs (Section 751: Area Health Education Centers; Section 753: Geriatrics; Section 755: Allie d Health) to train both educators and clinicians as experts in the clinical a pplication of Health Information Technology (HIT) and Electronic Health Records (EHR). Institutions with accredited health professions education and training prog rams should be authorized and funded to plan and develop interdisciplinary fa culty development programs to include 1) post-doctoral fellowships; (2) scholarshi ps, teaching, and service training for junior faculty; and (3) mentoring and retention support through demonstration models. Financial assistance should be provided to fellows and faculty enrolled in such programs. A major aspect of this new program is academic career development of faculty as clinician-educators with expertise in the clinical application of HIT/EHR systems in interdisciplinary settings. 2. The ACICBL recommends that the Secretary support and the Congress authorize and fund health professions training programs that will incorporate the use of emerging HIT/EHR systems in the development and implementation of interdisciplinary, community-based traini ng projects in underserved areas. Funds shall be allocated to Title VII Section 750 programs (S ection 751: Area Health Education Centers; Section 753: Geriatrics; Section 755: Allied Health) to support the establishment of HIT/EHR trai ning projects which involve safety net providers in shortage areas and incl ude funds to support trainees who participate in such projec ts in underserved areas. 3. The ACICBL recommends, in response to the growing shortages of allied health faculty, that the Secretary su pport and the Congress authorize and fund an Allied Health Faculty Loan Repaymen t Program to support individuals who pursue an advanced degree in allied health in order to become an allied health faculty member, and also become more fa miliar with the emerging application of HIT/EHR systems in interdi sciplinary, community-based sites. Support of this recommendation will increase the number of allied health faculty, students, and graduates and will address allied health personnel shortages in hospitals and clinics in underserved areas. 11 4. The ACICBL recommends that the Secretary support and the Congress authorize the expansion of the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Loan Repayment Program to include as eligible participants allied health professionals with a bachelor's degree from a higher ed ucational institution. Funds shall be appropriated to support NHSC and/or state loan repayment programs for allied health professionals willing to work in shortage area sites such as hospitals and clinics located in primary care health prof essional shortage areas. The extent of the allied health workforce shortage has been documented by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. THE SECRETARY The ACICBL recommends that the Secretary establish feasible requirements and guidelines for the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supported service delivery programs and health professions training programs to encourage grantees to employ HIT/EHR systems that offer a universal user interface and interoperability with regional systems. Variance with the guidelines and requirements shall be obta ined from a Federal entity such as the DHHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Collaboration with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is strongly encouraged. HRSA OFFICE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY 1 . T h e A C I C B L r e c o m m e n d s t h a t f u n d s b e p r o v i d e d b y t h e H R S A O f f i c e o f Health Information Technology (OHIT) to Community Health Centers (HCs) and other safety net providers for the development and implementation of HIT/EHR systems. These funds should support in terdisciplinary team HIT/EHR projects that demonstrate a partnership between HCs and interdisciplinary health professions training entities, including Area Health Education Centers, Geriatric Education Centers, and Allied Health trai ning programs. Additionally, support should be provided for the establishm ent and ongoing operation of regional technical assistance resource centers fo r HIT/EHR implementation by safety net providers and interdisciplinary training programs. 12 2. The ACICBL recommends that all HRSA initiatives/projects that support the adoption and implementation of HIT/ EHR include a broader and lengthened outcomes and evaluation process to provide evidence of successes and limitations for safety net providers and programs that train current and future health care providers. This recommendation would apply to HRSA supported service delivery programs, health professions training programs, initiatives, and projects funded by the HRSA OHIT in concert with the DHHS Office of the National Coordinator for Heal th Information Technology. HRSA BUREAU OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS 1. The ACICBL recommends that the HR SA Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr) convene a collaborative conference of the four Title VII and Title VIII statutory advisory committees that it ov ersees and administers: Advisory Committee on Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Linkages; Advisory Committee on Training in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry; Council on Graduate Medical Education; and the Nursing Advisory Committee on Nursing Education and Practice. This recommend ation serves as follow up to similar recommendations made in the Fourth an d Fifth Annual Reports of the ACICBL, and is in concert with a recent resolution adopted by the Advisory Committee on Training in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry and the Council on Graduate Medical Education. This conference co uld take place in the spring of 2008 and align Committee work products along co mmon themes such as the recruitment of the health professions workforce, pr eparation and training of the workforce, increased access to care for all segmen ts of the Nation's population, and expanded racial and ethic diversity in all of the health professions. 2. The ACICBL recommends, in recognition of the need for a set of core HIT/EHR competencies among health prof essionals, that the HRSA BHPr, in collaboration with the HRSA OHIT and the DHHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology convene a best practices and lessons learned conference that features di sciplinary and interdisciplinary programs and curricula designed to trai n current and future providers, across the health disciplines in core HIT/EHR competencies. The best practices and lessons learned shall serve as a resource for the development of HIT/EHR principles that could be incorporated into the applic ation guidance for health professions training programs. 3. The ACICBL further recommends that the HRSA BHPr consider as best practice models, those programs and curricula th at address cultu ral, generational, 13 geographic, and disciplinary differences. Emphasis should be placed on HIT and EHR models that demonstrate the following characteristics: a patient-centered, continuity of care approach; effective communication; cultural considerations throughout the life cycle; and articulation of ethical and privacy issues associated with the use HIT and EHR. 4. The ACICBL recommends that the HRSA BHPr collaborate with the Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions and the National Network of Health Career Programs in Two-Year Colleges to initiate a national project that would integrate essential elements of HIT and EHR into didactic curricula, ensuring that the components taught fulfill basic competencies needed to operate a variety of associated HIT/EHR systems. 14 RECOMMENDATIONS with RATIONALE and BENEFITS Recommendations to the Secretary and the Congress The ACICBL recommends that the Secretary support and the Congress authorize and fund a new Interdisciplinary Faculty Development Program for Title VII Section 750 programs (Section 751: Area Health Education Centers; Section 753: Geriatrics; Section 755: Allied Health) to tra in both educators and clinicians as experts in the clinical application of HIT and EHR. Institutions with accredited health professions education and training programs should be authorized and funded to plan and develop interdisciplinary faculty development programs to include post-doctoral fellowships; sc holarships, teaching, and service training for junior faculty; and mentoring and retention support through demonstration models. Financial assistance should be pr ovided to fellows and faculty enrolled in such programs. A major aspect of this new program should be academic career development of faculty as clin ician-educators with expertise in the clinical application of HIT and EHR syst ems in interdisciplinary settings. Rationale: A workforce capable of innovating , implementing, and using health communications and HIT will be critical to the provision of health care services. The need exists to adequately prepare a health care workforce capable of leading change and working in an electronic environment. The report In the Nation's Compelling Interest : Ensuring Diversity in th e Health-Care Workforce provides specific recommendations for health c are institutions. These areas include developing accreditation standards that promote a diverse faculty and student body and identifying resources to overco me financial barriers faced by minority students. Moreover, it is essential to support the passage of legislation to strengthen programs and increase funding for health information and informatics, education programs, student recruitment and retention, and faculty training. Creative ways are needed to provide fa culty development opportunities in the health professions. This could be accomplished through independent new programs or enhancement of existing programs. The current salary support structure of geriatric education could be used as a model. Faculty development across disciplines is necessary to teach HI T effectively, and to attain achievable outcomes. Accreditation standards are ne eded across professional disciplines regarding the current use of HIT, as well as criteria for those competencies for inclusion in the curricula of the health professions. 15 Teamwork, along with an interdisciplinary approach, will be needed to develop the HIT program that includes successful implementation of the EHR. Current EHR systems lack sufficient universalit y to enable training programs to generalize their use to actual practice settings. To facilitate interdisciplinary faculty development and training, funding support is required for loan repayment, academic career awards, and enhancing leadership skills for interdisciplinary programs and different professions. If EHRs were more consistent, training programs could adopt th em to serve as training platforms to enhance student and faculty preparation in actual practice. The Fifth Annual Report to the Secretary and Congress on Healthcare Workforce recommended that Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community- Based Training Grant Programs be encouraged to enhance the use of information technology in education and training strategies to facilitate retaining health professionals in underserved and un-served areas. Funding for programming directed tow ard the implementation of training through integration of allied health and post-doctoral fellowships relative to scholarship, teaching, and service, particul arly in support of training for junior faculty, would increase the availability of the healthcare workforce with the skills necessary to fully utilize EHR. Benefit: Faculty development would target the growth of the next generation of health professionals, necessitating gr eater development of faculty with HIT skills. More allied health professionals would be prepared to teach HIT and additional health professions would inco rporate HIT training in their programs as well. As described in the Title VII an d VIII legislation, some existing on-line programs have had success in retraining faculty members and could be applied to an HIT training initiative with appropriate funding and financial assistance for faculty and fellows particip ating in these programs. The ACICBL recommends that the Secretary support and the Congress authorize and fund health professions training progra ms that will incorp orate the use of emerging HIT and EHR systems in th e development and implementation of interdisciplinary, community-based training projects in underserved areas. Funds shall be allocated to Title VII Section 750 programs (Section 751: Area Health Education Centers; Section 753: Ge riatrics; Section 755: Allied Health) to support the establishment of HIT and EHR tra ining projects that involve safety net providers in shortage areas and include funds to support trainees who participate in such projects in underserved areas. Rationale: Presidential Executive Order 13410 Promoting Quality and Efficient Health Care in Federal Government Ad ministered or Sponsored Health Care 16 Programs was implemented January 1, 2007. A core purpose of this order is to use HIT to promote quality and efficient health care for programs sponsored by the Federal government. HRSA program s reach every corner of America and provide a safety net of direct health care services to 20 million people annually. Health center grantees deliver preventive and primary health care to about 14.1 million low income and uninsured people. Community Health Centers (HCs) serve roughly one in every four persons in the United States living in poverty. Data tracking, documentation, and fiscal challenges are enormous issues for HCs using paper records. The long term vi sion of HRSA's OHIT is to transform systems of care for safety net populations through the effective use of HIT. The transition to the EHR and a national he alth information ne twork will require a significant investment in technologi es, human resources, and training. Benefit: Interdisciplinary, community-based trai ning is an important educational complement to quality care, particularly quality care in underserved areas. Federal support for interdisciplinary work force training in the use of HIT and EHR systems in direct health care servic e in underserved areas is essential to promoting quality and efficient health care for federally sponsored programs. The implementation of this recommendatio n will contribute to improved quality of care, enhanced care to underserved populations, increased patient safety, decreased health care errors, better unde rstanding of health disparities, and an overall reduction of the so-called digital divide in the health care delivery system. The ACICBL recommends, in response to the growing shortages of allied health faculty, that the Secretary support and the Congress authorize and fund an Allied Health Faculty Loan Repayment Program to support individuals who pursue an advanced degree in allied health in order to become an allied health faculty member, and also become more fa miliar with the emerging application of HIT and EHR systems in interdisciplinar y, community-based sites. Support of this recommendation will increase the numbe r of allied health faculty, students, and graduates, and address allied health personnel shortages in hospitals and clinics in underserved areas. Rationale: In previous reports, ACICBL recommendations have addressed the problem of growing faculty shortages in the allied health professions. These shortages are part of the confluence of several factors including an aging health care workforce, the expansion of the United States health care system, and efforts to increase enrollment in academic allie d health programs to meet future health care workforce needs. This will be exacer bated as many of the current faculty in the allied health programs in colleges and un iversities retire over the next decade without a cadre of professionals prepared to assume these positions. Reasons for not pursuing a faculty career include the additional expense and time for 17 academic preparation along with modest facu lty salaries that can be significantly less than those of practitioners in the health care delivery sector. A significant incentive to pursue a faculty career would be a loan repayment program similar to those available through the Title VIII programs where there is clear evidence that such programs have provided a major incentive to pursue a career as a nurse educator, for example. Such a program for allied health faculty would provide a key opportunity for current health profe ssionals to pursue an academic career. Benefit : Federal loan repayment programs ha ve proven to be a major incentive for health professionals to become qualified for faculty roles in colleges and universities. However, there is no equivalent program for faculty development in the allied health fields. A lo an repayment program to support the development of faculty in the allied health professions would be a major step toward attracting future professionals. In turn, such a program would provide an incentive to prepare the faculty wh o would educate the future health care workforce. The ACICBL recommends that the Secretary support and the Congress authorize the expansion of the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) Loan Repayment Program to include as eligible partici pants allied health professionals with a bachelor's degree from a higher educational institution. Funds shall be appropriated to support NHSC and/or stat e loan repayment programs for allied health professionals willing to work in shortage area sites such as hospitals and clinics located in primary care health pr ofessional shortage areas. The extent of the allied health workforce shortage has been documented by the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Rationale: Much of the testimony heard by the Committee and several recommendations of the ACICBL Fourth Report emphasized the critical need for increasing the allied health work force to meet the needs of the health care system of the future. A major impediment to attracting students to the allied health disciplines is the increasing expense of obtaining a higher education. More students are assuming conside rable debt through loans leading to substantial repayment obligations after g raduation. While careers in the allied health fields offer many opportunities, the salaries are modest compared to many other professional fields and loan repaym ents can be a considerable burden. The Committee recommends that selected allied he alth professions be included in the National Health Service Corps loan repayment program. The professions selected should be those whose practition ers are determined to be most at risk for acquiring substantial debt while completing degree requirements. 18 Benefit : Increasingly students in the allied health disciplines must incur debt to complete their academic requirements and enter their professional field. This creates a serious barrier for attracting th e best students. Inclusion of allied health disciplines in the National Health Service Corps loan repayment program would offer a major incentive for students to complete a degree in allied health and remove a major financial barrier. Recommendations to the Secretary The ACICBL recommends that the Secretary establish guidelines and requirements for the DHHS supported ser vice delivery programs and health professions training programs to encourage grantees to employ HIT and EHR systems that offer a universal user interface and interoperability with regional systems. Variance to the guidelines and re quirements shall be obtained from a Federal entity such as the DHHS ONC. Collaboration with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is encouraged. Rationale: The adoption of HIT throughout th e health care community has been slow, (there is currently an overall implementation rate of 10 percent for EHR). There has been even less attention given to the adoption of universally compatible HIT systems. The lack of HI T and compatible systems is the biggest threat to efficiency and quality of pati ent care within the current health care infrastructure. A robust HIT interface w ill ensure that practitioners in the field have access to evidence-based data and can apply that data in their decision-making. It will facilitate the inclusion of new practice-based evidence into the overall health care database. It is crit ical that all health care professionals, including those in allied health, be t rained in HIT systems as part of their education so that they can become famili ar with various applications and act as agents for change. In order to carry out this educational mandate, existing faculties must undertake significant development activities that support integration of HIT into existing curricula. Benefit: Requiring compatibility of HIT systems for those programs receiving Federal funds for grant training obje ctives will improve the overall EHR infrastructure. This will encourage these project directors to collaborate and jointly develop systems that support redu ction of medical errors, increase access to evidence-based data, and facilitate comprehensive inclusion of new information into existing databases. This will aid in encouraging further development of those HIT systems that demonstrate the capability to improve the overall EHR infrastructure. Addition ally, educational institutions will be encouraged to train future health care professionals inclusive of those in the 19 allied health professionals on systems that are likely to be used in the field, increasing efficiencies an d reducing overall costs. Recommendations to the HRSA Office of Health Information Technology The ACICBL recommends that funds be provided by the HRSA Office of Health Information Technology to Community Health Centers (HCs) and other safety net providers for the development and imple mentation of interdisciplinary team HIT AND EHR projects that demonstr ate a partnership between HCs and interdisciplinary health professions tra ining entities, including Area Health Education Centers, Geriatric Education Centers, and Allied Health training programs. Support should be provided for the establishment and ongoing operation of regional technical assist ance resource centers for HIT AND EHR implementation by safety net providers and interdisciplinary training programs. Rationale : Health records and HIT are seen as major determinants of success in the work of interdisciplinary, inter-prof essional health care delivery teams. Nowhere is this truer than in rural and frontier areas and those areas served by HCs. Pressure for practice outcomes me asurement is increasing. The Committee heard testimony that an EHR infras tructure and improved information management practices are important means for delivering measurable cost and quality results in practice and in prof essional training settings. Health informatics can support communication, decision-making, and knowledge management, as well as help to prevent medical errors. These initiatives will require additional funding, both public and private. Capital costs present the biggest barrier to the use of HIT by safe ty net providers. A Health Affairs study showed that only 13 percent of HCs have EHRs that meet Federal standards. Rates of EHR adoption vary widely, and there is little interoperability across systems. HCs must consult, collaborate, and share experience and knowledge; consortia must also be encouraged. Ac ademic health centers and accredited health professions education programs can be key elements in developing these collaborative relationships. The Veteran s Affairs system has demonstrated the value of coordination for implementation of interoperable HIT systems. The Office for the Advancement of Tele-Health through HRSA established regional resource centers to provide needed expe rtise for telehealth technologies The Committee believes that a similar model co uld be used for the present endeavor. Benefit : A major benefit of HIT AND EHR support for safety net providers, through demonstration projects and region al resource centers is the opportunity for interdisciplinary outcome analysis and management. This will promote good medical decision-making, patient safety, and the practices of evidence-based 20 care. As these providers serve as precep tors for the next generation of competent health care professionals, educational aspects of a coordinated system of HIT AND EHR will enhance the experience of t rainees while assisting in the health care of the patients whom they serve. The ACICBL recommends that all HRSA initiatives and projects that support the adoption and implementation of HIT AND EHR include a broader and lengthened outcomes and evaluation pro cess to provide evidence of successes and limitations for safety net providers and programs that train current and future health care providers. Th is recommendation would apply to HRSA supported service delivery programs and he alth professions training programs, and initiatives funded by the HRSA Office of Health Information Technology in concert with the DHHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. Rationale : This programming and associated support represents a new effort for HRSA. Prior program efforts were criticized for not having sufficient outcomes data to evaluate program meri t. Awardees have raised the issue that awards are insufficient for appropriate outcome evaluation, particularly since evaluation requires longitudinal study pr ocesses (i.e., trainee practice behaviors well past graduation) and broader study criteria (e.g., examine health outcomes). Benefit: Good outcomes evaluation will enable HRSA and Congress to judge the effectiveness of programming. Recommendations to the HRSA Bureau of Health Professions The ACICBL recommends that the HRSA Bureau of Health Professions (BHPr) convene a collaborative conference of the four Title VII and Title VIII statutory Advisory Committees administered with in the HRSA Bureau of Health Professions, namely the ACICBL, Advisory Committee on Training in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry, Council on Graduate Medical Education, and the Nursing Advisory Committee on Nursing Education and Practice. This recommendation serves as follow up to similar recommendations made in the Fourth and Fifth Annual Reports published by the ACICBL. It is in concert with a recent resolution adopted by the Adviso ry Committee on Training in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry and the Council on Graduate Medical Education. This conference could take place in the spring of 2008 and would align Committee work products along common th emes such as the recruitment of the health professions workforce, preparation and training of the workforce, 21 increased access to care for all segmen ts of the Nation' s population, and expanded racial and ethic diversity in all of the health professions. Rationale: The four Title VII and title VIII statutory advisory committees of the BHPr, working independently to address the health care needs of vulnerable populations of citizens living in econ omic and/or geographically isolated communities identified several common problems that, if addressed, could improve the health care status of these unique populations. The HRSA Collaborative Conference would bring together the resources and the unique perspectives of the four statutory advisory committees, providing the opportunity to make unified recommendat ions to the Secretary and the Congress that would enhance the health care delivery to these underserved communities. D u r i n g t h e m o s t r e c e n t m e e t i n g s o f the Advisory Committee on Training in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry and the Council on Graduate Medical Education, both entities recommended that HRSA convene the Collaborative Conference in the spring of 2008. Benefit: The four statutory advisory co mmittees bring unique and diverse perspectives, but independently identifi ed a number of common issues that impact the ability to recruit, train, and retain the Nation's health workforce. While these shortages are a national prob lem, the consequences are especially profound in rural and inner-city communities that are economically disadvantaged and have a disproportional concentration of elderly patients with multiple chronic conditions. The committees identified four specific common problems that require attention: Enhancement of the preparation of the health professions workforce; Expanded racial and ethnic diversity wi thin all the health professions; Recruitment of a larger health professions workforce; and Increased access to health care for a ll segments of the Nation's citizens. These issues should be the initial areas of consideration for the collaborative conference, but should not limit the discussion. The conference outcomes will provide powerful recommendations that could rapidly impact preparation of the national health professions workforce. The expertise and experiences provided by the members of these committees would provide the Secretary with the foundation and unique perspective required to make influential health professions training recommendations to the Congress. The ACICBL recommends, in recognition of the need for a set of core HIT AND EHR competencies among health profe ssionals, that the HRSA BHPr in collaboration with the HRSA Office of Health Information Technology and the DHHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, 22 convene a best practices and lessons learned conference that features disciplinary and interdisciplinary progra ms and curricula designed to train current and future providers across the he alth disciplines in core HIT AND EHR competencies. The best practices and lessons learned shall serve as resources for the development of HIT AND EHR guidelines to be incorporated into the application guidance of health professions training programs. Rationale: The HIT and EHR advances are re cognized as essential for the efficiency, safety, and quality of the Ame rican health care system. In 2004, the President issued Executive Order 13410, which calls for a nationwide interoperable health information te chnology network by 2014. Support structures have been put in place to fac ilitate the achievement of this order. The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is the principal advisor to the Secretary on the development, app lication, and use of health information technology. It provides support to the America Health Information Community (AHIC), a federa lly chartered advisory committee appointed by the Secretary that provides recommendations on how to make health records digital and interoperable , encourages market led adoption, and ensures the privacy and security of those records. The HRSA Office of Health Information Technology is working to identify, disseminate, and provide technical assistance to HCs and othe r HRSA grantees in adopting model practices and technologies while promoting grantee health information technology advances and innovations as models. The full integration of HIT AND EHR requires investments not only in technology, but also in people and training. A HIT/EHR savvy workforce with critical skills and competencies is esse ntial to the development of a nationwide health information network. Workforce skills have been identified as a barrier to HIT/EHR adoption. For example, in September 2007 the AHIC considered the workforce issues pertaining to HIT/EHR adoption. Preliminary recommendations included the need for health informatics training and competencies among health professionals. The American Health Information Management Association (AHIMA) and American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) also recognized the ne ed for an educated workforce and, in response, are working on the identifica tion and development of core HIT/EHR competencies for the full range of health care professions. They have identified five core competencies: health information literacy and skills; health informatics skills in the use of the EHR and personal health records; health information privacy and confidentiality; health information data technical security; and fundamental computer literacy skills. Critical steps can be initiated in advanc ing a health workforce prepared to adopt and use the broad-based access to data and knowledge provided by HIT/EHR in 23 the delivery of interdisciplinary health c are through a coordinated effort of the Federal offices engaged in promotin g HIT/EHR adoption, professional associations identifying core competencies, and health professions educators sharing HIT/EHR programs, curricular, best practices, and lessons learned. Benefit: HIT/EHR is a means for the Nati on's health care system to: Improve efficiency in health care delivery; Improve quality of health care; Increase patient safety; Reduce medical errors; Enhance retrieval of health care data; Advance delivery of population-based care; Provide decision support at the point of care; and Improve use of administrative se rvices (e.g., reimbursement). Without a workforce skilled in HIT/EHR competencies, adoption will be slow, costly, inefficient, and ineffective in ac hieving the above outlined benefits. The BHPr is uniquely suited to support the Nation's safety net providers in acquiring HIT/EHR core competencies through the sharing of best practices and lessons learned. Another benefit of focusing HI T/EHR training on safety net providers is that data on health care disparities w ill become more readily available to assist in tackling this problem. An interdisciplinary, HIT/EHR training best practices and lessons learned conference will facilitate communication and sharing across health disciplines and among accreditation agencies, professional associations, academic institutions, state and Federal agencies, no n-integrated health care organizations (e.g., health centers), and integrated he alth care systems (e.g., Veterans Health Administration). Such a conference would provide an opportunity to learn from the investments of others and av oid the pitfalls experienced. The ACICBL recommends that the HRSA BHPr should consider as best practice models those programs and curricula that address cultural, generational, geographic, and disciplinary differences. Emphasis should be placed on HIT/EHR models that dem onstrate a patient-centered, continuity of care approach, effective communication, cultural considerations throughout the life cycle, and articulation of ethical and pr ivacy issues associated with the use HIT/EHR. Rationale: The Committee heard extensive testimony regarding the opportunities HIT and EHR provide for enhancing administrative processes and reducing patient errors. It is imperative that all health care systems move 24 forward aggressively to implement EHR systems, but the Committee is concerned that administrative requirements do not overshadow the need to keep the patient at the core of the planning , design, and implementation of an EHR system. Any implementation process must improve patient care and interaction through the collection of more accurate clinical data. Further, any implementation process must address comp lex issues related to the impact on the new continuity of care systems, on th e patient throughout the life cycle, and on the consequences of the ethical an d privacy decisions. These and other sensitive issues impact any new administra tive system. It is imperative that a diverse interdisciplinary committee of administrative and health care professionals give careful oversight to the planning and implementation process. Benefit: As HIT and EHR systems are implemen ted, the involvement of a broad based cadre of administrative and health care professionals will ensure a patient- centered focus that addresses personal, cultural, ethical, and privacy concerns as well as administrative requirements in the adoption of an EHR structure. The ACICBL recommends that the HRSA BHPr collaborate with the Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions and the National Network of Health Career Programs in Two-Year Colleges to initiate a national project that would integrate essential elements of HIT and EHR into didactic curricula, ensuring that the components taught will fulfill the basic competencies needed to operate a variety of HIT and EHR systems. Rationale: To improve the ability of the Nation's health system to utilize HIT effectively, education in these systems must begin with the next generation of health care professionals - those who are currently students. Ideally, students would be exposed to the concepts an d related components of HIT and EHR while in their didactic and clinical coursework. However, many may enter the workforce without previous exposure to HI T, creating a more difficult and more costly challenge when attempting to le arn how to use a specific EHR system. Encouraging the incorporation of the basic tenets of HIT during the academic preparation of students should result in competent graduates who can begin using HIT in practice. Two national asso ciations, the Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions and the Nation al Network of Health Career Programs in Two Year Colleges include member institutions that graduate the majority of allied health professionals in the United States. HRSA, working in collaboration with these organizations, should initiate a national project that would integrate essential HIT and EHR concepts into the curriculum. 25 Benefit: The goal would be to ensure that all allied health graduates would acquire a basic understanding of HIT and EHR before entering the health care workforce. 26 THE EXPERTS RESPOND WITH TESTIMONY - JUNE 2007 MEETING FEDERAL PERSPECTIVES AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF HIT/EHR Cheryl Austein-Casnoff, MPH/Director Office of Health Information Technology Health Resources and Servic es Administration (HRSA) The programs in HRSA provide a safety ne t of health care services to 20 million people annually. These programs include vital aspects of the safety net, such as health center grantees, which delivered primary health care to about 14.1 million mostly low-income and uninsured peop le in 2005, and Ryan White CARE Act grantees, which provide medication and care to more than 530,000 people with HIV/AIDS. Safety net providers are facing major challenges with respect to implementing HIT. Health centers frequent ly lack the capital to invest in HIT. Only eight percent of health centers curre ntly report using a full EHR. However, 60 percent of health centers report plan s for installing a new EHR system or replacing the current system within the ne xt three years (National Association of Community Health Centers [NACHC] 2006 survey). According to a Commonwealth Fund 2006 survey, doctors wh o treat large numbers of Medicaid p a t i e n t s a r e h a l f a s l i k e l y t o h a v e E H R s a s o t h e r d o c t o r s . D o c t o r s i n c i t i e s , i n larger practices, and in larger health c are facilities are more likely to have EHRs than those in rural areas. Bringing HIT to America's safety net providers will: Improve quality of care; Reduce health disparities; Increase efficiency in care delivery systems; Increase patient safety; Decrease medical errors; and Prevent a digital divide. Among the barriers to using HIT is the lack of a well-trained workforce to develop and implement the systems. There is also the burden of cost, since the start-up costs of a fully-operable HIT system are between $16,000 and $36,000, and there is no current system of reimbursement to recover these costs. Another barrier is the lack of standards needed to find, select, and implement such a system. The Office of Health Inform ation Technology (OHIT) promotes the 27 adoption and effective use of HIT in the safety net community. The long-term shared vision of HRSA and OHIT is to tr ansform systems of care for safety net populations through the effective use of HIT via the following goals: Develop a strategy that leverages the power of health information technology and telehealth to meet the needs of people who are uninsured, underserved and/or who have sp ecial health care needs; Identify, disseminate, and provide technical assistance and appropriate information technology advances to he alth centers and other grantees in adopting model practices and technologies; Promote grantee health information technology advances and innovations as models; Work collaboratively with foundations, national organizations, the private sector, and other Government agenci es to help HRSA grantees adopt health information technology; and Ensure that HRSA's HIT policy and programs are coordinated with those of other DHHS programs. Related activities include the Health Center Controlled Networks (HCCN), a grant program that supports the develo pment and operation of networks of safety net providers through the enhancement of health center operations, including HIT. Using HCCNs to adva nce HIT allows for collaborations and expertise sharing among providers, economies of scale, and business and cost efficiencies. These telehealth activities coordinate and promote the use of telehealth through fostering partnerships within HRSA and with other Federal and private entities to promote projects and demonstrations, administer grants that advance the use of telehealth technologies, provide technical assistance, and disseminate best practices with regard to these technologies. The HIT Technical Assistance in FY 2007 was evident with the initiation of a center to identify and organize the HIT technical assistance efforts across HRSA. Network Grant Opportunities include: Planning Grants - Less than $100,000 per year to plan and start implementing HIT initiatives; EHR Implementation Grants - Three-year grants to purchase and implement the EHR; HIT Innovation Grants - Three-year grants to purchase and implement new HIT initiatives; and High Impact EHR Implementation Grants - One-year grant for high impact implementation of an EHR. (I mplementation of new EHRs must be in at least 15 sites.) The Agency for Health Care Rese arch and Quality (AHRQ) and HRSA established a HIT Community for HRSA grantees as a collaboration space for 28 health centers and networks to foster the adoption of HIT to promote patient safety and higher quality of care. The HC HIT Toolbox is an interactive toolbox that will assist HRSA grantees in planni ng, implementation, and sustainability. Additionally, HIT Grantee M eeting involved 500 HRSA grantees to promote collaboration and knowledge shari ng on the subject of promoting HIT adoption by safety net providers. The 2008 Federal budget proposes spending over $4.5 billion for HIT through funding agencies such as HRSA, CMS, NIH, and AHRQ. Federal agencies already implementing HIT include the Fo od and Drug Administration, Indian Health Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Defense, and the Veterans Health Administ ration. One of the driving forces behind HIT at the Federal level is the Presidential Executive Order 13410 (Promoting the Quality and Efficiency of Health Care in Federal Government Administered or Sponsored Health Care Programs). The purpose of this order is to ensure that health care programs admi nistered or sponsored by the Federal government promote quality and efficient delivery of health care through the use of HIT. The order mandates transpare ncy regarding health care quality and price and incentives for quality care init iatives. The order promotes interagency interoperability, the ability to communi cate and securely exchange data accurately, effectively, and consistently with different information technology systems, software applications, and ne tworks in various agencies. These standards, established by multi-stakeh older entities including Federal and private agencies, apply to systems with in a Federal agency, between Federal agencies, and between Federal and private agencies (i.e., independent contractors such as health care providers and health plans must also meet interoperability standards). Health care programs su bject to this order are the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program, the Medicare program, programs operated directly by the Indian Health Services, the TRICARE program for the Department of Defense and other unif ormed services, and the health care program operated by the Veterans Health Administration. This does not include State operated or Federally funded subsid ized programs such as Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, services provided to Department of Veterans Administration under 38 U.S.C 1703, or HRSA programs. This unfunded mandate was implemented on January 1, 2007. The OFFICE OF THE NATIONAL COORDINATOR FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (ONC) advises the Secretary on the development and nationwide implemen tation of an interoperable HIT infrastructure in moving toward the President's goal of having an EHR for all Americans by 2014. The ONC coordinate s the DHHS HIT policies and programs internally and with other relevant agencies and is responsible for the implementation of the DHHS strateg ic plan to guide the nationwide 29 implementation of interoperable HIT in bo th the public and private health care sectors. Initiatives include the American Heal th Information Community (AHIC), an advisory committee that provides reco mmendations on how to make health records digital and interoperable; enco urages adoption of technology; and ensures privacy and security, product ce rtification, standards, a nationwide health information network, and activities with the National Governors Association Center for Best Practices. The AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY (AHRQ) funds HIT research and development with $166 million in grants and contracts awarded for initiatives across the country to encourage the development of HIT. In FY 2007, AHRQ emphasized research on two initiatives to improve health care quality for low-income people served in under-resourced settings and communities. These initiatives included th e National Resource Center for Health Information Technology to assist the health care community adopt HIT through technical assistance and knowledge di ssemination and New Ambulatory Safety & Quality Grants to support the development of HIT that assists clinicians, practices, and systems in improving the quality and safety of care delivery and medication management in ambulatory care settings ($25.8 million to fund up to 104 grants). Priority is given to projec ts serving vulnerable populations. The CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) MEDICARE - supports HIT develo pment through the following: Quality Improvement Organizations (QIO), a national network of 53 organizations, work directly with cons umers, providers, and hospitals to refine care delivery systems. The QIOs , designed to ensure that patients get proper care, adopted HIT as strat egies to achieve program success. Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108-173) serves to foster electronic prescribing, e.g., the ability to electronically send a prescription di rectly to a pharmacy from the point- of-care. These standards for e-prescribing under Part D were effective January 2006. Doctor's Office Quality-Informatio n Technology (DOQ-IT) supports the adoption and effective use of information technology by physicians in their offices to improve quality and safety for Medicare beneficiaries. They accomplish this by promoting greater availability of high-quality and affordable HIT for the office-based physician. MEDICAID - affords States with several opportunities to incorporate HIT initiatives into their reform plans, such as: 30 Section 1115 Waiver (DRA) allows States to increase their flexibility to develop Medicaid plans that may extend coverage to additional populations, increase covered services, and control costs and Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) prov ides grants for States to allow the flexibility to design different coverage options for different populations without applying for a Section 1115 Waiver. These new grant funds provide States with the abili ty to adopt innovative methods to improve their effectiveness and efficien cy in providing medical assistance under Medicaid. The VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (VHA) is the largest single medical system in the United States, provid ing care to over five million veterans. The VHA has Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA), an integrated system of software applications that directly supports patient health care at VHA facilit ies. VistA is one of the most widely used EHRs. In February 2007, the VH A and Department of Defense (DoD) demonstrated the Bidirectional Health Information Exchange, a joint information technology data exchange initiative that affords VHA and DoD clinicians with the opportunity to view electronic health ca re data from each other's systems, the potential basis for a national system to exchange medical records securely. The INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE (IHS) currently provides health services to approximately 1.5 million American Indians and Alaska Natives who belong to more than 557 federally recognized tribes in 35 States. Providers use the Resource and Patient Management Sy stem (RPMS), an EHR that allows providers to continuously manage all aspects of patient care. West Virginia adapted the RPMS EHR system for its clinical practice. MOVEMENTS WITHIN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH H.R. 1467 10,000 Trained by 2010 Act would invest as much as $100 million in health care information tec hnology research and training. S. 1408 Health Information Technology Act of 2007 proposes a grant program to assist physicians, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, community health and community mental health centers in implem enting HIT. The bill also includes changing reimbursement polic ies in the Medicare system to reward qualifying facilities for adopting interoperability standards, reporting improved patient care, and adhering to strict privacy and confidentiality regulations. H.R. 1952 creates incentives for physicians to adopt interoperable EHRs. H.R. 2406 authorizes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to establish standards and guidelines for interoperability of EHRs. S. 1455 creates a non-profit corporation that would design, own and manage a nationwide health information exchange network and ensure that all EHRs are confidential, secure and interoperable. 31 States are becoming more involved in he alth information exchange initiatives by setting policies to improve accessibility of HIT. The majority of States have introduced HIT related legislation and one fifth of the Nation's governors have issued executive orders for action to improve health care through the use of HIT. Their roles in HIT planning include: Start-up funding with 17 State go vernments supporting programs to examine how HIT may be used or implemented; Building infrastructure with 10 States facilitating RHIO development studies; and Planning with six States initiating planning projects without legislative action (National Council of State Legislatures). The NGA Center for Best Practices was awarded a $2 million contract from ONC to establish and manage the State Alliance for e-Health, which provides a nationwide forum for stakeholders to work together to identify best HIT practices and solutions. UPCOMING INITIATIVES Personal health records - Continuous records of diagnoses, medications, treatments and outcomes, clinical decision support, and clinical data repositories will dramatically improve continuity of care by 2014. Bio-surveillance and Public Health - Public and private health care providers will make extensive use of bio-surveillance when responding to natural disasters, epidemics, and terrorist attacks includin g identification and management of the psychological response to trauma. Continuity of care for military personnel - Portable EHRs will improve access to physical and mental health and diagnostic and treatment services for veterans with physical injuries, post-traumatic stre ss disorder, and traumatic brain injury. 32 BEST PRACTICE: A STUDY OF THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION'S DECADE PLUS EXPERIENCE WITH EHR Gail Graham, RHIA/Director Health Data and Informatics Veterans Health Administration The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Nation's largest integrated health system, transformed itself in the past decade from a collection of traditional safety net hospitals to an integrated health system providing a continuum of care to more than 7.6 m illion veterans in 1,300 sites. The VHA is affiliated with more medical schools than any other health sy stem. The current challenges of VHA, like those of all pr oviders, include the increasing cost and complexity of health care; the abili ty to harness the power of advanced information technologies; and the ability to translate new research breakthroughs quickly into practice. Further, the VHA patient population is increasingly older and tends to have multiple conditions, often with a coinciding mental health diagnosis. Additionally, more women are entering the military with health care issues that may be different from men. The VHA has experienced a growth in patient load, but not a corresponding growth in bu dget. In 1996, the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act was enacted, which made more people eligible for care. This Act enabled the system to be restruct ured from a hospital system to a health care system. The structural changes wer e predicated on the assumption of providing the most effective and efficien t care and required coordination among facilities along with a synergy of resources. The VHA has had automated information sy stems in all of its medical facilities since 1985, the point when its decentralized hospital computer program began operating. At that time, physicians were using the system to review lab and radiology reports. Therefore, it was a natural progression for doctors to begin using HIT for other reasons, although it was not a smooth transition. The VHA hired staff members charged with determining the best user interface for HIT for different provider types. These staff me mbers were also available to assist physicians on call with questions. This addition provided significant enhancements with the release of the co mputerized patient record system for clinicians in 1997 along with a multimedi a, online patient record that integrates traditional medical chart information with medical images of all kinds (e.g., x- rays, pathology slides, video views, scanned documents, cardiology exam 33 results, dental images, and endoscopies). The system is operational at VA medical centers and supports ambulatory, inpatient, and long-term care. The computerized patient record system (CPRS) was developed to provide a single interface for providers to review and update a patient's medical record and provide orders for medications, procedures, x-rays and imaging, patient care nursing orders, and laboratory tests. The CP RS is flexible enou gh to be used by all providers and can be implemented in a wide variety of care settings. The CPRS organizes and presents all releva nt patient data immediately when a patient is selected and provides an accurate view of the current status before any clinical interventions are ordered. The highly graphical interface of the CPRS allows for its use as a patient education tool and can show a patient the impact of a medication or the practice of a heal thy behavior on one's health status. The VHA soon added the ability to view data from wherever the patient was seen. Most recently, every part of the re cord can be seen from any care setting within the VHA. The us e of CPRS was mandated in 2003. Today, the CPRS is fully operational at all medical centers an d most other VA sites of care. The VHA is also active in supportin g public health and bio-su rveillance activities. The VHA sends the CDC two feeds of data ever yday for bio-surveillance activity; the CDC then feeds the summary informatio n back to the VHA and local health departments illustrating any trends and changes. The addition of the clinical reminder system affords providers with th e capability of ensuring the initiation of timely clinical interventions, such as screening for vaccinations. Physicians could be prompted by a particular diagnosi s, time or other characteristic of the patient. This system offers providers the opportunity to implement clinical practice guidelines and to automatica lly generate documentation within the record. Another element that has been added is bar-code medication administration to track ordering and changes in dosages. It was originally used for inpatients, but is now being used in outpatient depart ments to include surgery, chemotherapy, and dialysis. A nurse and a pharmac ist oversee the implementation and continued development of this important system. A major cost control strategy is the use of formularies and mail orde r pharmacy distribution. The pharmacy vendor electronically receives the medi cation orders from each of the VA Medical Centers and ships the medications directly to the patient's home. A secure patient portal known as Health eVet provides patients with access to their personal health record, online he alth assessment tools, mechanisms for prescription refills and making appoin tments, and access to consumer health information. Although deployed nationally, the CPRS and Health eVet are not 34 yet available at every VHA site because of varied internet access in rural areas. Currently, Health eVet is available wherever Internet access is available. The VHA is looking at telehealth and re mote health monitoring to accommodate the needs of the aging populations outsid e of nursing home care. Telehealth enables access to specialty care via telecomm unications from a local clinic so that the veteran does not have to travel to a specialty facility. For home monitoring, medical information is fed back to an individual medical center where a nurse may monitor 200 to 300 patients at a time, reviewing anomalies in any of the reporting of the physiological findings being received. Some of these include questions asked of the patient and frequently avoid the need for hospitalization for monitoring purposes. The impact of this system is the ability to see and care for more patients without an increase in budget. The American Customer Satisfaction Index for both inpatient and outpatient satisfaction is consistently higher than that of the private sector. The VHA is moving towards interoperability by adding the Department of Defense record and, in the future, connecting to the regional health information organization. The VHA is also working towards standardizing all information in VA centers across the country. 35 EHR END USER ADOPTION AND CHANGE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES Sharon Confessore, PhD/Director Organization Development and Learning Bon Secours Health System Kaiser Permanente Mid Atlantic States (KPMAS) is comprised of 29 medical centers and 36 facilities, with approximately 6,000 employees, which includes 900 physicians. The union represents three-fo urths of the staff, which means that the decisions had to be made in partnership with the employees. KPMAS implemented an ambulatory EHR within 15 months. The practice management piece, check-in/check-out, and billing wer e implemented in about seven months, as part of the transition to Medicare Part D. The My Chart or Personal Electronic Health Record was implemented in 5 months. After the implementation, patients were able to e-mail their physicians, view medical records, and receive lab results on line. Bon Secours Health System (BSHSI) is comprised of 14 hospitals that employ 25,000 staff and clinicians, with 8000 affiliated physicians and 200 physicians employed by BSHSI. Their systems are to be rolled out within the next five years with in-patient, ambulatory care, emerge ncy department, electronic prescribing, and hospital management systems (e.g., inventory bed management) all being implemented. The first system w ill go into operation in July 2008. There are major differences between th ese two implementations. The KPMAS implementation had a very short time f rame and a very tight focus. Optimizing patient safety and treatment came after the implementation of the system. The BSHSI implementation occurred over a lo nger timeline with a great deal of thought being given to patient safety and im proving quality of care. The greatest consideration for implementing th e EHR at KPMAS was being market competitive by having a tool that no on e else had. Within BSHSI, in some markets this was the case, but not in all cases. The need to motivate physicians to be trained is significant. At KPMAS, the physicians were all employed by the organization so they could be compelled to be trained on the EHR system. In BSHSI, the majority of physicians are aff iliated, thus, training would incur a loss of revenue. In terms of managing change, there are se veral actions that are very important, centering on building common understanding and increasing comfort with the new information. In practice, this means providing leadership development at all levels of the organization, analyzing the existing work units to understand current capabilities and needs, and determ ining what workflow changes need to 36 be made and why they need to be ma de. One critical factor centers on understanding how people currently do their work, alone and together. Before the technical system is implemented, some kind of analysis must be conducted of efficiencies and inefficiencies. Bala ncing an implementation timeline with improved process benefits early on is an important part of the discussion. Others actions include determining the current competencies of the staff who must implement the new system, as well as the competencies they are going to need once the system is in place. This effort requires an understanding of work process disruptions and opportunities where EHR can improve the situation. This can also allow for examining how pe ople approach tasks at work and how to adapt these approaches to the EHR. The role of change leader is to stimulate and provide space for conversations with stakeholders about the change. These conversations should feature as many visual elements as possible to acquaint potential users with changes that will come with the EHR. A large part of building understanding is identifying the sponsors, champions, and stakeholders and working with them while targeting those who need to adopt and us e the system. The strategy can be built from that point through the alignment of the technical system design with the needs of these stakeholders. The change leader should facilitate experiences with the system. Offering demonstrations and tr ainings will be critical for increasing the comfort levels of stakeholders. Once everyone is on board, there will be issues with managing the change. The cost and intensity of the program will create its own energy and require extensive work and committed leaders. The question of who owns the change must be answered early or there is a ri sk of unclear focus, mixed messages, and resistance to change. The leadership and the individuals should own the transformation and the project team should be there to support the providers in the work that they do. Another crit ical issue is declaring the unit of implementation, the smallest unit possible, where people have to understand not only their work, but also the work of the people around them. The unit of implementation drives a large part of the mechanical decisions, such as who gets trained and when. At some point, change management become s end user adoption or the process of encouraging all parties to actually use the system. The critical piece on end user adoption is physician acceptance of the system, which requires substantial resources over a long time period. Al though it can be expensive and time consuming, it is necessary to involve the physicians in all aspects of the process because of their natural leadership role within the hospital. For physicians, patient care and patient safety are compelling arguments. Efficiency is a good argument, but initially, because of the time spent learning the system, it is often 37 not cost effective. In the KPMAS implementation, physician schedules were reduced 50 percent to allow time for traini ng and learning. Another issue is that training will take more time, focus, and resources than expected in that people are at different skill levels and learn at different paces. 38 INFUSION OF INFORMATICS AND HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INTO THE MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRICULUM Jeffrey Weinfeld, MD/Assistant Professor Georgetown University Department of Family Medicine Health Information Technology (HIT) is a broad umbrella that encompasses many different aspects. It could be a practice management system or Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) for providers. An EHR might only have notes that providers write, or it could be broade r, with notes, codes, transactions, and demographic data. It can contain decisi ons and/or support to help providers make better decisions, but little is known about what EHRs can do for outcomes. It is known that using deci sion support (in PDAs or other formats) can actually improve adherence to guidelin es. Electronic prescribing can address the issue of medication errors. There is tremendous cost savings with the prevention of medication errors, but stud ies of time and productivity have yet to show a positive impact of HIT since it takes longer to use and implement an EHR. The Liaison Committee on Medical Educ ation (LCME) is the nationally recognized accrediting authority for medical education programs leading to the medical degree in medical schools in the United States and Canada. The LCME developed standards and objectives for medical educational programs including the following: The program of medical education leading to the medical degree must be conducted in an environment that fo sters the intellectual challenge and spirit of inquiry appropriate to a community of scholars; The educational program must includ e instructional opportunities for active learning and independent study to foster the skills necessary for lifelong learning; and The curriculum must incorporate the fun damental principles of medicine and its underlying scientific concepts; allowing students to acquire skills of critical judgment based on evidence and experience and developing students' ability to use these princi ples and skills wisely in solving problems of health and disease. LCME programs have specific evaluation standards. The medical school faculty must establish a system for the evaluation of student achievement that employs a variety of measures of knowledge, skills , behaviors, and attitudes throughout medical school. Objectives are based on the idea of integrating technology into 39 all courses rather than developing a separat e course. This process ensures that a student will have the ability to retrieve (from electronic databases and other resources), manage, and use biomedical information for solving problems and making health care decisions. This incl udes collecting, critiquing and analyzing information, taking action based on findings, and communicating and documenting processes and results. The current technological situation in educational programs in medical schools across the country is quite varied in that 46 percent of programs require students to own or have access to a personal computer; 28 percent of programs require students to have a personal digital a ssistant; 16 percent of programs require students to have both a personal comput er and a personal digital assistant; and 83 percent of programs include medical informatics in one or more required courses (mean time 8.7 hours, range 1-52). Many schools are currently teaching evidence-based medicine (e.g., critiquing medical literature and using it to make decisions). There is a growing body of ev idence that suggests that it is possible to teach the use of evidence-based medici ne along with best practices. Medline searching is a competency that can be taught in medical education. The class that is about to enter medica l schools in July - August 2007 is the class of 2011. They were roughly born in the mid-'80s and are sometimes referred to as the millennials or generation Y. These students are tremendously familiar with technology and the use of the internet. However, this does not necessarily translate into medical competency. The results of surveys of graduating medical students suggest that these students feel the least competent with things that would lend themselves to evidence-based medicine, such as reviewing medical literature, epidemiology or biostatistics. They felt the least competent with activities like using technology, such as a PDA or practicing tele-medicine. While technologically savvy, these students do not have the comfort level with technology that their practices will require. A CASE STUDY OF THE INFUSION OF HIT INTO THE GEORGETOWN MEDICAL SCHOOL CURRICULUM Georgetown, a large, private program, ope rates a non-profit hospital (without a current EHR). As of 2002, the medical school's objectives were to acquire: A knowledge of biomedical science and the ability to acquire, manage, integrate, and apply this knowledge to the care of patients; The ability to evaluate critically new knowledge and to determine its relevance to the clinical problems and challenges presented by the individual patient; The ability to perform basic clinical procedures; The ability to solve and reason through clinical problems; The ability to learn independently; and 40 The clinical virtues of fidelity, trust, respect for others, excellence, duty, honor, integrity, humility, accountability, and compassion. Two of the earliest courses to use technology were biostatistics and epidemiology. These courses were also the first to use computers in the classroom. Then, in the 1980s through a grant, the Integrated Advanced Information Management System was implem ented. This was the first system to increase access to technology through op tions like digitizing the library card catalogue and creating portals for MEDLINE searching. This led to a course in the 1990s called Medical Data and Reasoning, similar to what is currently referred to as evidence-based medicine. This was essentially a few lectures and labs focused on information retrieval an d expert systems, such as decision support systems, and clinical system s. These were the first EHRs. In the 1990s, the university received a Ti tle VII grant called the Family Medicine Pre-doctoral Grant to develop case-bas ed methodologies for teaching family medicine to family medicine clerks and to ensure that clerks off and on campus were learning the same methodologies. This course increased the use of technology by requiring students to create PowerPoint case presentations, conduct remote presentations via NetMeeting, and manage and present cases on line. At the same time, a group involved in a Public Health Informatics project introduced first year medical students to pu blic health and information retrieval. Students were assigned a presentation on the demographics, health problems, and issues for one county. This allowed students to acclimate to retrieving and using medical information and encouraged the use of problem solving skills. Through a second grant in 2001, the schoo l incorporated the use of personal digital assistants (PDAs) into student training. This includes the use of PDA based patient logs and decision support tools to teach prevention. Now, the school requires the use of PDAs. Studie s show that giving students decision support on PDAs increases current and fut ure personal and professional use of evidence-based medicine. In 2003, the sch ool conducted an internal informatics survey and found that 50 percent of their courses and clerkships required that students conduct sophisticated searches of medical information databases, 84 percent of courses and clerkships required students to use email, 46 percent required the use of blackboard websites and 38 percent required that students critically review a published research re port. Family Medicine was the only required course or clerkship that ma ndated presentation software (e.g., PowerPoint) to create visual material s to support an oral presentation. The school created a lecture workshop combination to enhance clerkships by adding the use of evidence-based medici ne. The curriculum included a one hour lecture addressing the knowledge, valu e, and objectives of evidence-based 41 medicine. This lecture taught students how to formulate clinical questions and identify appropriate sources to answer each type of question. The workshop element was a hands-on, two hour exercise pairing clinicians and librarians. The topic was using library resources (i.e., Medline, InfoPOEMs, OVID, MDConsult) to find answers to clinical questions. An evaluation showed that students found the instruction helpful and valued the hands on aspect of it. However, students expressed uncertainty in selecting the best resource and critically appraising the information found. As such, the sch ool developed committees to make recommendations for revising existing curriculum. The recommendations were to revisit the existing evidence-based medicine and informatics focus within existing courses and to expand these topics across courses. There were several barriers to making these curricular changes. There were multiple organizations involved, meaning that multiple stakeholder groups needed to commit to the change. Th ere were financial limitations, and the business case for the expenditures wa s not always clear. Within community health centers, there were additional barriers such as time and resource constraints and the clinicians feeling removed from the decision-making process. There were several institutional lessons learned from this program. First, grants were helpful in overcoming curricular inertia. Second, there needs to be a transitional point when there is a need to invest in infrastructure. Third, small projects can grow into curricular innovations. Finally, having interested faculty members to support the initiative was necessary, but institutional buy-in is critical to long-term success. 42 USE OF EHR IN CLINICAL PRACTICE AND TRAINING - EXPERIENCES FROM AN ARKANSAS AHEC PROGRAM Mark Thomas, MD Residency Faculty Northwest Arkansas AHEC Center AHECs have trained a total of 597 fami ly physicians that practice in 121 Arkansas communities in 70 of the 75 counties in Arkansas. The AHEC Northwest, one of seven AHECs, has a budget of $9.1 million dollars, 132 full and part time employees and 142 clinic al faculty members, and comprises two family medical centers affiliated with two hospitals and maintains a local medical library. In FY 2005, the two medical centers had a total 30,000 annual patient encounters, 125 emergency room visits, 2,500 hospital admissions, and 300 nursing home visits. The center sta ff delivered approximately 500 babies and 120 patients per day. The top four diagnoses seen in family practice centers across the country (according to the AAF P) are hypertension, diabetes, upper respiratory infections, and well childcare. These common diagnoses are conditions that can be best assisted by the use of an EHR. In Arkansas, there are some specific driv ers of the decision to use EHR. The Arkansas Council on Graduate Medica l Education (ACOGME) requirements state that programs not currently using an EHR system shou ld document their plans to convert to one in the near future. Further, the requirements mandate that all residents must actively participat e in scientific inquiry, necessitating time and ability to conduct studies in primary care settings. The guidelines insist that residents learn practice based quality im provement. Other influences such as market forces, health systems requiremen ts, and regulatory changes at the State level, encourage the adoption of an EHR. The University of Arkansas medical center uses EHR to varying degrees. Almo st all of the ambulatory care clinics use them. Four of the AHEC clinics have active EHRs and two are in the process of implementing EHRs. The remaining center is planning to convert to a different EHR vendor from the current system. Th e traditional practice model could be characterized as practicing alone togethe r. The quality of chronic disease care was dependent on the physician's time and memory and the reliability of the patient in showing up for their office visit. Providers often do not communicate follo w-up schedules well and do not know what is going on with patients over time because there is no data. This acute care reactive model does not prevent problems or look at the chronic disease patient prospectively. With the use of technolo gies like disease registries for chronic 43 care patients, it is easier to use active care models to provid e continuity of care and prevent complications. The AHECs looked for the following capa bilities with respect to an EHR: consolidates the total patient record; accessible from anywhere at any time; allows trending and protocol management; provides a clinical training tool; flexible to change; stores discrete data for research and practice assessment; interoperable; and maintains patient privacy. The implementation process for one AHEC center began with lots of paper and money spent supporting the paper. Appointments were hand written into an appointment book. Chart documents like lab reports and treatment notes were all on paper. Systems were necessary to support the paper charts, su ch as creating charts for new patients, filing and storing charts, transcription, and materials costs for paper and folders. The process began with establishing a State level planning group that was charged with configuring the EHR to address the needs of each AHEC and developing an implementation plan. The group budgeted about $1.2 million to do the statewide implementation an d determined how to fund it. The implementation costs included servers for $10,000. In total, the estimated cost was about $60,000 per site and $60,000 in oppo rtunity costs (the revenue that was lost from not being able to see patients while the system was being implemented). There are numerous areas of learning, which yield future research opportunities. In training, it was discovered that nurses were a vital element in training new faculty and pr oviders. As such, there should be a training grant focused at recognizing th e role of the registered nurse and the licensed practical nurse in the Family Practi ce Center as teachers in the use of the EHR. Additionally, preliminary audits of residents using EHRs found a discrepancy of five percent between elec tronic and paper records due to errors and not recording things correctly. One other potential area of research is ethical considerations with the use of the EHR. New clinicians and doctors have to discern a number of different aspects when they see a patient, and having the comput er in the room makes this learning very difficult. This directly informs the kind of training that students get in medical school when they learn to do a physical exam or take a history. These processes are changing fundamentally, not only due to the presence of the EHR, but also due to how the clinician reacts to it. The clinicians' style influences how they interact with the EHR; for example, patien t focused (interpersonal) clinicians will rarely look at records where data focused (informational) clinicians will make greater use of it. Pilot testing and debugging were continuous processes. There was a pilot group testing the system and continuously debugg ing the system's conf iguration. After 44 the hardware and software were inst alled and configured, the system was thoroughly debugged, and staff education and training began. With the current operational system, appointments are ente red and classified by type. When the visit begins, the appropriate tool is automatically provided based on appointment type. All ancillary service re sults go directly into the electronic chart. The end result has been a reduction in the need for storage space, purchasing costs, personnel costs, and changes in assignments. The implementation experience at the AH ECs generated several best practices. There are two features that contribute to the increased length and decreased effectiveness of the EHR notes. The first is the automatic insertion of phrases into the notes. The other is the copy -and paste command which allows notes from one day to be copied and used as a template for the next day. This can create confusion and inaccuracies. Suggestions are to use mobile computer monitors and reserve templates for the docu mentation of notes. In terms of the clinician patient interactions, the facility should train the clinicians to utilize the technology and encourage inclusion of th e patient in development of the EHR. The standardized EHR is the central nerv ous system of a new model for practice. 45 USE OF EHR IN RURAL SETTINGS AND ITS IMPACT ON RURAL HEALTH Tommy Mullins Administrator & CEO Boone Memorial Hospital Technological access in many rural hospit als is lacking. Many do not have access to email through the facility so im plementation of an EHR would be very difficult. The process for this rural hospit al began in 1999 with the evaluation of different vendors. At the time, the syst em was rejected as too expensive. In 2002, the hospital administrator began getting requests for software packages from different departments (laboratory, home-care, and the pharmacy). The reality was that if the requested systems were purchased, they would not be able to communicate with each other. There was a need for a re-evaluation of an IT model suitable across the entire facility. Initially, the administration reviewed the possibilities of expanding the current system, but it was not cost effective to upgrade that system and maintain it relative to getting a new system. The administration explored bids to obtain a new integrated, facility wide informatio n management system. The process of reviewing bids was beyond the expertise of current staff, so an outside consultant was hired to evaluate the thr ee bids. Two of the three original vendors were invited to demonstrate their product for department heads, mid level managers, and physicians. The administration also conducted site visits to vendor headquarters, as well as site visi ts and telephone conferences with other facilities using these vendors. Finally, multiple large and small staff group meetings were conducted to discuss the pros and cons of each vendor. After 12 months of consideration, the hospital co ntracted with a vendor that specialized in HIT for rural hospitals. It is important to have up-front, 100 perc ent buy-in from all participants. This includes engaging all staff from the botto m up. Every staff member has to feel a part of the system. Additionally, each division in the institution, including medical staff, has to have a champion for th is system that can lead by example. It is especially important to gain approval from the physicians so that they can serve as advocates and advise other physicians. The implementation date was set by the administration and not the vendor, so that the hospital was able to prepare as much as possible prior to adapti ng to the system. This included time to inventory the computer literacy of staff to determine who needed extra training. Those staff members participated in evening computer training. An implementation coordinator was designated as a point of contact for all staff. 46 These coordinators were people wi th facility-wide exposure, good communication skills, and excellent comp uter knowledge. At 16 months, the administration implemented the financial, order entry, and ancillary tests resulting in pharmacy, medical record s, registration, and business office outsourcing software modules. The Point of Care (POC) implementation for documentation of nursing and ancillary departments and Bar-Code Medication Administration was accomplished three months after the organizational and financial modules (although in retrospect, five to six months are recommended). In 2004, the administration introduced a web-based patient record that physicians can access at any time. In March 2005, the hospital implemented Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) . This system had the benefits of reducing difficulties associated with illegible physician writing, clarifying physician orders, and reduci ng medication errors and duplicate therapies. The system also provided for the electronic authentication of an order so no physician signature would be required. Th e major disadvantage to this system is the length of time for implementation, which resulted in some doctors losing interest in advocating for the change. The final module implemented was the physician's office module, which al lowed for registration, scheduling appointments and billing, as well as ad hoc report generation. The most common reasons for EHR failure are weak executive level sponsorship, unrealistic expectations, no organi zed mechanism for communication and feedback, lack of the formal training plan, and a lack of effective leadership at the physician level. When considering a vendor, one should access the following issues: the kind of facility that the vendor specializes in (e.g., rural facility, large hospital, Critical Access Hospitals); the cost of upgrades and software changes; the standard to structure patient data submitted in support of payment claims, known interfaces and Health Level Seven (HL7) compliance; and the vendor's proposal with regard to sustaining the facility in terms of support and software maintenance. In this hospital's experience, the mi nimum capitol investment was $500,000 with $100,000 annually in maintenance. About five to ten percent of net revenues should be budgeted for an EHR system. After three years, the hospital is still having difficulties with some employ ees who cannot use it; continuous retraining is necessary. There is a limit ed pool of computer savvy nurses, which can make hiring them more difficult in a shortage market. Hospitals that receive Federal funding have a given timeline for compliance. The hospital required four years to implement the current system . Yet, the effort continues to be a work in progress; the system is work ing to achieve the 100 percent level. 47 USE OF EHR IN THE ACADEMIC SETTING David Dorr, MD, MS/Assistant Professor Medical Informatics & Clinical Epidemiology Oregon Health & Science University The Care Management Plus Project focu ses on using HIT to support the care management and the treatment of patients with multiple chronic illnesses, meaning that their treatments are subject to multiple guidelines. Chronic illness is being focused on because medicine does not do a sufficient job in this arena. The chronic illness burden is increasing, so the shift to focus on these needs is becoming even more important. For chro nic illness care, specifically, there is a special set of needs that a health care sy stem focused on episodic acute care does not provide. This gap is where HIT and te am based care can fill. The question is - how do we prepare in academic settings to use HIT and team based care to address the needs of chronic illness? Studies of residents have found that th ey were not getting good training in chronic illness care. Residents were also la cking a sense of working on a team in the outpatient setting. Further, they were not treating the patients according to the recommended guidelines for a significant portion of the time. Health Information Technology can be used to improve the quality of care through computerized reminders, clinician educat ion, and practitioner involvement in quality improvement, formal patient self-management programs, the use of disease registries, and the use of nu rsing care and case management. The usual care model is created for acut e care. If somebody comes in with a symptom, he/she receives the treatmen t and the physician is paid for that treatment. The connections are not ma de at the community level and patient education is secondary to treating the symptom. This creates frustration on the part of the patient as well as a lack of efficiency. Continuing medical education is done in lecture format to individual pr oviders, not in the context of team care delivery. In the chronic care model, there is a team-based approach that emphasizes continuous quality improv ement and longitudinal chronic illness care. This model includes continuous patient education to encourage self- management of chronic conditions. Within this model, HIT is essential to success. The desired outcome is informed active caregivers, patients, and providers. The Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Program selected 60 second and third year residents for a chronic illness management rotation. These residents were trained in a team care mode l with an intensive HIT focus. There were 580 patients with diabetes mellitus. Of those patients, 27 percent had commercial insurance, 61 percent were fe male, 26 percent were non-white, and 48 27 percent had co-morbid depression. For this rotation, residents begin their days reading the patients EHRs and the disease registries, and then planning treatment for patients in a multidisciplin ary team setting. The residents worked with a multidisciplinary group of professionals to provide total patient care. The medical assistant was empowered to do a lot in terms of checking on the care of the patient and including the family, while working together to improve communication. RNs served as care mana gers; social workers interacted with families and the patients in meeting their needs and connecting them to other resources. Pharmacists provided information about medications and interactions. This entire team responde d to the needs of the patients and their families. There are different HIT elements necessary for this kind of model to work. The first is the patient registry. A registry is different from an episode-based EHR that has population-based patient data over time as well as chronic illness care and preventive care needs. The second is the summary sheet at point-of-care, which is basically individual data over time using evidence and guidelines to focus on what needs to happen for each patient. These two HIT elements are used extensively in the improvement team meetings. Each member of the care team was encouraged to use the electronic record. After participating in this rotation, more than half of the resident s felt that they could start a chronic disease care management program. Under this model, patients of the residents were more likely to receive preventative care, such as flu vaccines and cholesterol testing. Implementing care management has a numb er of major challenges. The current system is created for episode (visit) based care when most of the action (as far as what causes the illness) happens outside the visit. Patients benefit from coaching, motivation, self-management, and education over time to manage what happens outside the office visit. C oordination of care requires substantial amounts of information (e.g., care plan , patient needs, and other treating physicians' reports) over time. The C are Management Plus Program can help create a medical home through a proactiv e, flexible, system that can vary by intensity and function for different populati ons and needs. It focuses on chronic illnesses, which account for a disproportionate amount of health care needs. About 50 percent of the chronically ill population might have a mild or moderate chronic illness and may do well with plan ned visits and self-management. Less than one percent of this population has a very high need (e.g., mentally ill and homeless) for services that will require very intense care management. The remaining 49 percent have multiple chronic illnesses. 49 The provider's ability to manage these co mplex chronic illnesses is limited due to the knowledge needed regarding the many conflicting and competing needs of these patients over time. The core idea is for patients with complex needs to be referred for any one condition and then to have the Care Manager, RN, or Advanced Practice Registered Nurse do a general assessment for all conditions. The care manager is trained to assess and create a plan for the patient, interact with a number of their providers, and ac t as a catalyst to make sure that the treatment plan occurs. This provides a structure within the clinic that these patients with intense needs can access. Technology is used to both access and modify the care plan. Communication is one of the most important elements as this is happening over time. There is al so an element of evaluation with ongoing feedback. The Care Management Plus program has tw o critical HIT elements. The first is the Patient Summary Sheet, which the whol e team uses to document and review treatment. The second is a care manageme nt tracking database, which is a list of tasks for the care manager. This databa se helps remind the team members not only what they have planned in terms of the protocols or follow up with patients, but also about the illnesses that they are following and where they are in terms of the treatment plan. The results of impl ementing this model reduced the odds of death significantly. Further, admissions for any cause were reduced by 27-40 percent over two years. Physicians using the Care Management Plus Program were eight percent more productive. More efficiency was gained through better documentation, a slight increase in visits, and a change in practice pattern. Given the increase in productivity, a clinic in the right enviro nment could pay for the cost of the care manager. The Care Management Plus program is currently operating in 26 clinics in the state of Oregon. 50 AN URBAN EXPERIENCE \u2014 UNDERSTANDING THE REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATICS ORGANIZATION NEW YORK CLINICAL INFORMATION EXCHANGE (NYCLIX) Gil Kuperman, MD, PhD/Director, Quality Informatics New York Presbyterian Hospital There are quality problems in health care . The establishment of EHRs can help, but dissemination is slow. Data about th e patient in other institutions is not available to the clinician during the office visit. In primary care, studies have shown that clinical information is missing in 13 percent of visits. In 52 percent of that time, it is available in some outside system. In emergency settings, information gaps are present in 32 percent of the visits, most often in sicker patients. In 48 percent of thes e cases, that data is essent ial to care. A study of the Bronx Medicaid managed care program found that 30 percent of emergency department visits are not to the member's primary hospital. In Queens, it was 21 percent. Interoperability increases the valu e of EHRs in the sense of getting the data from point A to point B in the patient setting. Federal policy is working to target interoperability and there are pilot funding opportunitie s to encourage the development of interoperable records. The NYCLIX is a non-profit organization with a mission of establishing an interoperable regional data exchange. It began as an IT initiative within the Greater New York Hospital Associatio n (GNYHA) to understand what area hospitals could do to work together better. Providing interoperability of records was a prime suggestion, but competitive concerns needed to be addressed so physicians would not be concerned about losing their patients. In order to limit these concerns, it was decided to begin by making emergency care data available to doctors as patients generally do not choose where they go and the potential for competition is limited. Other steps to allay competitive co ncerns included emphasizing that interoperability was good for the patient and having GNYHA serve as an intermediary to ensure honesty on both sides. These steps brought the city and State Departments of Health, payers, home health, medical societies, and local foundations to the table. In the effort to make reco rds interoperable, there were a substantial number of technical, business, and privacy issues to address, including evaluating the effort. So, the administration decided to apply for a NLM IAIMS two year, planning grant. 51 While waiting for this grant, New York State announced the Health Efficiency and Affordability Law (HEAL), a four ye ar, $1 billion bond act for restructuring health care in New York. The first ye ar had a large HIT component, for options like electronic health records prescribin g and data-sharing projects. It also encouraged interoperability in that there had to be more than one organization on the project and there had to be data sharing. NYCLIX applied for this grant with give goals: 1) to build a technical in frastructure to affect this linkage; 2) to implement this ED-based data exchange application; 3) to support public health activities (e.g., disease surveillance and repo rting); 4) to evaluate the impact on cost, quality, safety; and 5) to create a sustainability plan. The NYCLIX was awarded $4.7 million through the HEAL program and matching funds. There are 14 participan ts: 11 hospitals, the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, and two ambulatory care groups participating. The governing board is composed of representatives from each organization and non-voting, but interested parties from the New York Department of Health and the United Hospital Fund. The governan ce includes several subcommittees. The Legal Committee created the by-laws for the organization, developed participant agreements, ensured compliance with HI PAA privacy and data security rules, and provided financial services. The Technical Committee developed the desired technical architecture for the EHR and selected the vendor. The Evaluation Committee was charged with identifying evaluation topics (e.g., usage, utilization, financial impacts), identifying measures that were data- sensitive, and developing an experimental design. The Clinical Advisory Group did a baseline needs assessment of emerge ncy department physicians to identify their perceived needs related to data exch ange, to define the most valuable data elements, to analyze work flow (potential and user initiated), and to determine where the EHR would fit with the current all paper system. The Communications Committee developed a participant newsletter and websites, and eventually had responsibility for grant writing. The Consumer Committee identified which consumer groups should be involved and how to involve them (e.g., identify the appropriate language to use to explain the technology and to sponsor patient advocates for the technology). The Public Health Workgroup was responsible for tracking mandatory surveillance of reportable diseases, population health reporting, conducting public health scenarios, and maintaining communica tions between public health and clinicians. Finally, the Business Commi ttee was responsible for sustainability, identifying potential funders, involving outside organizations in the NYCLIX mission, and tracking the progress of other EHR projects across the Nation. 52 The NYCLIX addressed many early challe nges in providing an opportunity to improve care with data interchange. Organizations have learned to work together cooperatively and to minimize the influence of politics and competition. It still needs to resolve so me early technical challenges and prepare for longer-term challenges of being a robust asset to health care in the New York City region. Sustainability is critical to the continued growth of the program. The NYCLIX recently submitted a proposal for the current HEAL 3 grant cycle. The goals of this proposal are to expand the number of organizations that are part of NYCLIX, to integrate two other health data organizations, to allow for the capture of Medicaid claims data, and to identify how to use data exchange to support disease management. This proposal includes 13 stakeholders composed of hospitals, physician groups, non-acut e care organizations, payers, and HEAL phase one grantees. 53 THE EXPERTS RESPOND WITH TESTIMONY - SEPTEMBER 2007 MEETING BUILDING THE WORKFORCE FOR HEALTH INFORMATION TRANSFORMATION Claire Dixon-Lee, PhD, RHIA, FAHIMA Vice President for Education and Accreditation American Health Information Management Association Executive Director Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Management Education Transition to an EHR and to a nation al health information network (NHIN) requires a significant investment in tec hnologies, people, and training to succeed. Building the HIT savvy workforce with the critical skills and competencies essential to develop the nationwide health information network is a pivotal part of addressing these needs. Several organizations work together to shape the field of Health Information Management (H IM). The HIM is a profession that serves as a link between users (e.g., clin icians, payers, regulators, and patients- consumers) and technology (EHR and HIT). The AHIMA has been in existence since 1928 and has more than 51,000 members nationwide. The recent emphasis has shifte d from just the health record to the entire field of health information. The Commission on Accreditation for Health Informatics and Information Manageme nt Education (CAHIIM) established educational, accreditation, and credentialing processes. There are currently 245 accredited academic programs in HIM. In 2006-2007, these programs had more than 14,000 students trained to understand both health records and technology. They are focused on understanding the entire health care organization rather than merely the records. Two professional credentials are available, specifically the registered health information administrator at the baccalaureate level and the registered health information technician at the associate level. The e-HIM is an initiative of AHIMA representing the practice of HIM in an electronic environment. Organizational goals include promoting the migration from paper to an electronic medical records informat ion infrastructure, reinventing how institutional and personal health inform ation and medical records are managed, and delivering measurable cost and quality results from im proved information 54 management practices. These goals apply to both hospitals and other environments, such as providers in thei r offices, clinics, nursing homes, and assisted-living facilities. For students, HIM education operates in the domains of data content, structure, and standards; privacy and security management; electronic health record life cycle; data administration and analytics; personal health information management; reimburs ement; regulatory compliance; fraud surveillance; and organization and management. The AHIMA and American Medical Inform atics Association (AMIA) developed a joint alliance, called the AAAC Alliance Committee, to work on issues of mutual interest. In 2005, the AAAC he ld a workforce summit, inviting 48 stakeholders representing the CEOs of health care organizations, government agencies, academic institutions and prof essional associations. This summit was built on some initiatives from outside the field that address the need for informatics. For example, the IOM quality chasm reports emphasized using informatics to support communication , decision making, and knowledge management and prevent medical errors . The workforce summit produced a report that included five key workforce goals: Jointly define a multi-year workforce research agenda; Define basic competencies for those who use the EHR in daily work; Engage informatics and information management education leaders to prepare a vision of the academic resources and network needed in the United States; Seek Federal and private funding to support initiatives; and Secure legislative solutions for wo rkforce development and to address retraining shortfalls. The AAAC report addressed some correspon ding issues, such as the shortage of faculty. The AHIMA and AMIA collaborative education goals are to train the current workforce serving the health care industry to use HIT. These initiatives include educating the health professions educators an d the entire HIM workforce. The workforce encompasses he alth information managers, health and medical informaticians (i.e., scholars working on research supporting the systems themselves), and HIT professi onals (e.g., software engineers and computer scientists). In 2007, the AHIMA and AMIA worked on a project to develop core competencies for the health workforce. These were core compet encies that would apply to the entire health care profession, from admissions clerks to providers. The competencies, arranged along four core competency domains, included the following: Health information literacy and skills; Health informatics skills, using the EHR and personal health record; 55 Health information privacy and confidentiality; and Health information-data technical security. A fifth domain, fundamental computer literacy skills, was added, but the primary emphasis has been on the aforementioned areas. The core competencies project used a task force of health pr ofessionals and other stakeholders to develop a matrix of settings and roles fo r the core competencies to include: Medical care delivery sites, which include acute and ambulatory care, physician offices, military hospitals, enterprise-based outpatient clinics, long-term care facilities, communi ty-based health care organizations, specialty care services, and school health centers; Other service delivery sites, such as magnetic resonance imaging facilities, pharmacy, dental clinics, behavioral health and rehabilitation centers, employer occupational health; and Ancillary entities, which include pu blic health agencies, regional information exchanges, and health record banks. The matrix was developed for providers such as nurses, physicians, allied health care, and pharmacists; organizational staff, including IT, administrative personnel, clerical staff, and human re sources; and other parties, such as financial-regulatory staff, third-party payers, data analysts-providers, public health workers, consumers, educators, clinical preceptors, students, and emergency medical personnel. The core competencies were applied acro ss the positions and settings in the matrix to develop a list of skills and ab ilities required of HIT personnel. For example, for the core competency of heal th information literacy and skills, a staff member should be able to: Use health record data collectio n tools such as input screens and document templates; Apply standard data definitions, vo cabularies, terminologies, and/or relevant health care data sets such as OASIS, HEDIS, and UHDDS as used in the organization's health information systems; Differentiate between the types and content of patient health records (paper-based, EHR, and personal health record); Adhere to health record documentatio n requirements of external agencies and organizations such as those specif ied by accrediting bodies, licensure, reimbursement, and discipline-specific good practice; Adhere to organizational health re cord documentation requirements, policies, and procedures; and Ensure that documentation in the he alth record reflects timeliness, completeness, accuracy, appropriateness, quality, integrity, and authenticity. 56 The AHIMA has a focus on quality heal thcare through quality information. Toward this end, AHIMA developed an Internet-based learning lab with an array of health care technology software fo r HIM students. This virtual lab offers lessons and activities for student practice, instructor training support, and self- paced, instructor-led training. More than 4,000 students from 80 of the 245 programs are currently using this lab. The lab provides students with copies of popular HIT software, a shared library of lab lessons to use with the lab applications, face-to-face and Web suppo rt group training, lesson development workgroups, and a growing network of instructors. The AHIMA has several goals for the future. The group is working toward advancing HIM standards and estab lishing core curricular standards internationally, increasing training programs internationally, and ensuring the success of EHR nationally. As an associ ation, AHIMA is working to address the need for professional development thro ugh educational conferences, distance education, books, audio seminars, profes sional journals, and other electronic media. The AHIMA is also working to provide information about HIM as a career option for young people through networking and recruiting initiatives. The AHIMA plans to develop a process fo r certification of EHR-HIT vendors. 57 INTEGRATING HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INTO THE ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS CURRICULA David Gibson, Ed.D. Dean University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey School of Health Related Professions Biomedical informatics is an emerging discipline that has been defined as the study, invention, and implementation of structures and algorithms to improve communication, understanding, and mana gement of medical information . The end objective of biomedical informatics is th e coalescing of data, knowledge, and the tools necessary to apply that data and knowledge in the decision-making process. This focus on the ability to ma nipulate information is what separates biomedical informatics from other medical disciplines. In 1999, the AMIA conceded the need to integrate informatics into health professions education and identified two areas\u2014data mining and interdisciplinary outcome management\u2014w herein this integration could be accomplished. With data mining, a grow ing number of health care settings use databases, thereby increasing the need fo r people with the skills to manipulate and extract relevant information. With interdisciplinary outcome management, providers are increasingly being asked to practice evidence-based medicine and work in interdisciplinary teams, increasing the need for new outcomes measures. The AMIA identified several core co mpetencies with respect to medical informatics for non-medical informatics health professionals. Application of a multicultural approach to outcomes by responding to the different needs of different ethnic groups. For example, certain groups respond to medications differently an d, as such, there needs to be an adaptation of informatics to address these differences. Use of computers by understandin g the basic methods of software development, software use, presen tations-graphics, e-mail, Internet searches, and human-computer interactions. Addressing issues generated by medica l informatics via the application of privacy and ethical issues, decision making, learning terminologies, standards, and communication methods. Use of information by understanding user-driven clinical systems, using structured data to support evidence-b ased practice, learning to critically and effectively process information, and evaluating information and information technology. 58 Impact of technology to address the impact of technology on public health and how it changes the ways in which people work and live. The need for medical informatics is pervasive among every health profession, including allied health care. Allied health care accounts for myriad professions and constitutes 30 percent of the total health care workforce, though the estimates vary widely depending on how allied health is defined. These providers are involved in every aspect of patient care, but the collective voice is not often heard. Many compelling exam ples highlight the communication breakdowns between different allied heal th providers and between health and traditional allied health providers. As the EHR is supposed to be a shared reso urce representing the total health care experience, all providers involved should know how to use it. For example, oral health is considered a reliable predictor of overall health status. A necessary step is to ensure that oral health information is shared with the health care team. Consequently, dentists and allied dental professionals must have informatics skills that commensurate with their particip ation in the provision of health care. Another example is dieticians, who provide nutritional counseling for both preventive care and for specific diseas e and chronic disease management. They should have the informatics skills necessary to ensure that other providers understand a patient's risk for drug and food interactions. They should ensure that the nutritional history and status are included in the EHR. If these providers are not taught how to use an EHR, the health care system's ability to respond in cases of emergencies (e.g., biomedical or bioterrorism threats) will be seriously hampered. Pressure for practice outcom es measurement is increasing. If a provider cannot use the technology, these outcomes cannot be evaluated. The movement toward patient-centered care means that more patients are coming to the provider with health inform ation obtained from the Web. In these cases, providers need to be able to respond with their own information or an interpretation of what has been presented by the patients. At the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, the School of Health Related Professions established a task forc e to study how to integrate informatics into the undergraduate curricula of its allied health programs. This has been a difficult and time-consuming task. The task force began by working to achieve consensus on the meaning of health informatics. The task force is also grappling with computer literacy issues. Regional accreditation agencies increasingly require proof of outcomes specific to the graduate's computer literacy at the undergraduate and higher levels. The 59 task force has begun the development of basic computer literacy skills for their students. As such, students should be able to: Access the Internet for research pe rtinent to courses of study; Use software programs for presentations or papers; Analyze and critically compare information sets; Store, retrieve, and synthesize pertinent informational data; and Demonstrate ethical behaviors in the use of electronic data. For allied health students, the needs go beyond these skills. Allied health students must understand the basic unde rpinnings of informatics as a tool for enhanced patient care. Students should be able to manipulate data to test basic hypotheses. 60 IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS IN HEALTH CENTERS Kevin Fiscella, M.D., MPH Associate Professor Family Medicine, Community, and Preventive Medicine University of Rochester School of Medicine & Dentistry Community health centers serve roughly 16 million persons (i.e., one of every four persons in the United States living i n p o v e r t y ) . T h e y h a v e a m i s s i o n t o provide health care to the underserved an d function as a primary care safety net. The typical HC patient lives in poverty and has low education, literacy and health literacy levels. They are more lik ely to be members of racial and ethnic minority groups and, in many cases, have limited English proficiency. Typical patients have multiple health problems and present with three or four medical problems embedded within a milieu of complex psychosocial problems. Clinicians deal with a qualitative di fference in the level of complexity. Data and documentation are huge issues for HCs using paper records. Due to the fact that the HC patient base is so complex, charts can have multiple volumes, making it very difficult to find paper records. This can mean that patients are sometimes subjected to unnecessary retesting if records cannot be located. The volume of paper may be a sa fety issue. Information about a patient may be buried in a chart that the provider has not seen. Another issue for HCs focuses on tracking rates for visits. Overall, only 50 to 70 percent of the patients confirm their appointments. Some patients may be absent 30 to 50 percent of the time. As HCs re ceive visit-based reimbursements, they tend to overbook appointments to compensate for no-shows. This overbooking can lead, at times, to very rushed visits during peak patient volumes. The HCs often experience fiscal difficulty. Half the time, HC expenses exceed their revenues and as a consequence, lim ited budgetary discretion exists to address the various needs. Clinician turnover is a serious problem. The average stay for a HC clinician is about three years. The level of turnover and change creates a certain amount of disruption that can be challenging in terms of meeting the needs of patients. The turnover can be attributed to the pace of work in HCs, which is consistently heavy and stressful. Many clinicians who are retained find themselves working part-time because full-time work is too demanding to mainta in over a long period. Fundamentally, HCs are faced with the same situation th at disadvantaged patients encounter. Patients with the greatest biomedical morbidity and the greatest need for health 61 care, often have the least ability to pay for it. The same is true for HCs, as they serve a needy population, but oftentimes do not have the resources to fully meet their needs. Despite many challenges, HCs serve an essential function in the health care safety net. They provide medical homes for patients and employ clinicians committed to making a difference to their patients. The focus within HCs is fundamentally interdisciplinary (i.e., clinicians and other allied health provider s work in one site with the same patients). The major strength of this interdisciplinary focus is the ability to adapt to changes in the broade r environment, based on the changing needs of the patients. The HCs have limited resources and limited excess capital to devote to HIT. However, HIT offers many advantages for HCs. The HIT can enhance data retrieval by making it easier to obtain data about patients who are multifaceted with complex charts. This technology o ffers the ability to provide population- based care (i.e., gathering data on the he alth status and needs of the population through condition registries and similar processes). It can provide decision support at the point of care, providing in tegrated and relevant information at the time of service and improve efficiency in the manner in which primary care is delivered and reduce medical errors. The HIT makes it easier to work within the current reimbursement system and to up-code procedures to maximize reimbursement. This is an incentive to use HIT for private practice and HCs supported by private payers. The HCs that are not supported through private insurance are not going to gain much through up- coding. The implementation of pay for performance will motivate health care entities to adopt HIT because those with out it will not be able to compete as effectively. However, HIT is not a magic bullet and has limitations. Prior to implementation, a very careful examinat ion is needed to determine how the practice is going to be redesigned as part of the use of HIT. Some evidence suggests that when HIT is us ed in HCs, it is more often used to support quality improvement as opposed to other settings. All providers face changing their focus to population health. The core mission of HCs is to provide population care to their entire communities. However, few EHRs provide sufficient registry functions to do this alone, though many do have connectivity potential with other systems. The major issue is tracking. Without a registry, data analysis is needed to determine patients at risk for conditions and to actively work to bring them in. Once pa tients with diseases are identified, it is necessary to track their progress through recommended treatments and tests. Each step of a recommended treatment is a point at which the patient can get 62 lost. Registries should be made to conne ct with EHRs so dup licate information is not being created and entered. Capital costs present the biggest barrier fo r the use of HIT. The HCs do not have the capital available and many cannot borro w it. A recent Health Affairs study shows that only 13 percent of HCs ha ve EHRs that meet minimum Federal standards. Several costs come into play , including implementation and that of downturn in patient volume that comes with EHR implementation. Such revenue loss can be critical to HCs. Yet, HIT enables team-based care and requires major change, commitment, and dialogue on the part of all members of th e team. Implementing EHRs is stressful for providers, particularly in HCs wherei n the work is already challenging. As such, planning is very important. Equally important, potential unintended consequences must be addressed. If th e system is not well planned, not well designed, or does not fit the culture an d needs of that particular setting, the consequences can be disastrous. Though the need for HIT in HCs is si gnificant, the risks of acquiring and implementing HIT can be considerable. Oftentimes, there is very limited expertise available at the HCs. Approximately 40 percent of the HCs do not have a director of IT. Overall, HCs posse ss fewer reserves, in both human and economic capital. Their costs of re cruitment and retention are enormous, especially in primary care and general internal medicine, where the numbers of new graduates have been declining in recent years. The HCs have the most trouble attracting primary care clinicians. If clinicians leave, a year may elapse before they can be replaced. In turn, HIT does not offer a very good return on investment for HCs, as they are not going to recapture capital, implementation, and planning costs. Though pote ntial savings are possible in terms of reducing medical re cords staff and transcr iption, the ongoing costs of training staff and of system maintenance will have to be covered. Oftentimes, people working in HCs are not particularly HIT savvy and may have unrealistic expectations of what EHRs can do. A misalignment of costs and benefits occurs. HIT can reduce overall health care costs, hospitalizations, unnecessary prescriptions, and adverse dr ug events, but, due to the existing reimbursement methods, the HCs are not going to capture these savings. The implementation of HIT presents an enormous opportunity for HCs to learn from one another. One of the great strengths of the Health Disparities Collaborative is that it brings HCs together to share their experiences. The collaborative should be used as a model for implementing HIT in HCs. Keeping abreast with advances in HIT requires a dedicated staff person who is able to 63 translate HIT into clinical practice and adapt vendor systems to the needs of the practice. There should be a way to sort out clinical relevant information. The same is true with respect to decision support. Staff members will need to redesign the workflow, the exchange of information, and the ways in which tasks are done. The EHR now provides the potential for patients to actually complete information before their visits, but to do so will require changes in the manner in which business is currently conducted. This will generate a huge need to train the trainer within the HCs. Training should begin at the top with the CEO in terms of understanding the issues but will eventually need to be conducted at all levels. It is important to note that some staff might find this change more difficult than others. Tenure in positions may be a consideration along with the numb ers of non-technical staff persons. 64 REVIEW OF TITLE VII INTERDISCIPLINARY, COMMUNITY-BASED TRAINING GRANT PROGRAMS The legislation set forth in Title VII, P art D, of the Public Health Service Act identified five programs, all with the ce ntral mission of training and education, and deemed to have the potential to support linkages that can have positive impact upon the quality and availability of health care services to populations that have traditionally been underserved or are otherwise medically vulnerable. These programs are as follows: Area Health Education Centers (Section 751); Health Education and Training Centers (Section 752); Geriatric Education and Training Programs (Section 753); Quentin N. Burdick Program for Rural Interdisciplin ary Training (Section 754); and Entities engaged in the education an d training for the allied health professions and other di sciplines (Section 755). Although these programs differ in detail, they share common elements; each has the potential for fostering the development and application of interdisciplinary, community-based linkages. This occurs in areas where such linkages are most urgently needed, on health care delivery issues of greatest concern from a community standpoint. They all provid e training in community settings for health professions students, medical residents, and local providers. In addition, they provide key links between the acad emic health institutions, federally qualified health centers, and communities . They all are integral parts of the health care safety net system. Goals shared by all the programs include: Increasing the numbers of health pr ofessionals who can function in an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary, community-based setting, through the training of students in the health professions, education of faculty in academic health centers, and continuing education for health care practitioners; Promoting a redistribution of the health care workforce to underserved areas within our Nation; and 65 Improving the health status of the mo st vulnerable of our citizens by providing them access to health c are professionals who are technically well-trained, culturally competent in the care they provide, responsive to the needs of the communities in which they work, and comfortable providing care as part of an interdisciplinary team. 66 CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS Area Health Education Cent ers (AHEC) - (Section 751) Funding Levels for the AHEC $28,681,000 The goals of the AHEC Program are to improve the recruitment, distribution, supply, quality, and diversity of personnel who provide health care services in underserved rural and urban areas, or to populations with demonstrated serious unmet health care needs; to increase the number of primary care physicians and other primary care providers who provide services in such areas and to such populations; and to increase health careers awareness among individuals from underserved are as and underrepresented populations. To accomplish these goals, AHECs carry out the following activities: 1. Develop and support the community-base d, interdisciplinary training of health professions students, particul arly in underserved rural and urban areas. Exposing health professions students to underserved communities increases the likelihood that they w ill return to these communities to practice. 2. Provide continuing education and other services that improve the quality of community-based health care. Im proving the quality of care also enhances the retention of provid ers in underserved communities, particularly in federally qualified community health centers. 3. Recruit underrepresented minority and disadvantaged students into the health professions through a wide variety of programs targeting elementary through high school students. Minority and disadvantaged students are grossly underrepresented in the health professions. These students are more likely to practice in underserved communities upon completion of their training. 4. Facilitate and support practitioners, facilities, and community-based organizations in addressing critical local health issues in a timely and efficient manner. AHECs often focus on interdisciplinary education in which multifaceted education pr ograms are developed and are implemented at community-based training and service delivery sites. 67 AHEC Program Outputs FY 2006 Actual FY 2007 CR Number of medical students trained in community sites in rural/underserved areas 20,000 20,000 -- Number of associated health professions students trained in community sites in rural/underserved areas 20,000 20,000 -- Number of training linkages with community/migrant health centers and other underserved area sites 1,500 1,500 -- Number of local providers who received continuing education on women's health, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, health disparities, cultural competence, and bioterrorism response 315,000 315,000 -- Number of elementary/high school students receiving health career guidance and information from the Kids into Health Careers 330,000 330,000 -- Number of minority/disadvantaged students participating in a health career training and/or academic enhancement experience 42,000 42,000 -- Number of States with AHEC Programs 46 46 -- Source: http://www.hrsa.gov/about/budgetjustification08/interdisciplinary.htm Health Education and Training Centers (HETC) - Section 752 Funding Levels for the HETC --The goals of the HETC Program are to: Improve the supply, distribution, quality, and efficiency of personnel providing health services in the United States along the 68 border of Mexico and in the State of Florida; Improve the supply, distribution, quali ty, and efficiency of personnel who provide services in other urban and rural areas, including frontier areas of the United States and health services to any population group, including Hispanic individuals who have demonstrated serious unmet health care needs; and Encourage health promotion and disease prevention through public education in the areas described above. To accomplish these goals, HETCs carry out the following activities: Conduct training and education program s for health professions students in the assigned service area; Conduct training in community-based health education services, including training to prepare community health workers; and Provide education and other services to health professionals practicing in the area. Geriatric Programs - Section 753 Funding Levels for the Geriatric Programs FY 2002 2007 $31,548,000 The goal of the Geriatric Programs is to improve the training of health professionals in geriatrics, through three specifically funded programs. Geriatric Education Centers are dedicated to the interdisciplinary geriatric education and training of all health professionals. Geriatric Training for Physicians, Dentists, and Behavioral/Mental Health Professionals ensure that physicians, dentists, and behavioral/mental health professionals become experts in geriatrics in order to serve as faculty for other trainees in their respective health professions. Geriatric Academic Career Awards are designed to increase the teaching of geriatrics in medical schools through the development of junior faculty who are committed to academic careers teaching clinical geriatrics. 69 To accomplish these goals, grantees carry out the following activities. Improve the training of health prof essionals in geriatrics by providing geriatric residencies, traineeships, or fellowships; Develop and disseminate curricula to health professionals on the treatment of health problems of the elderly; Support the training and retraining of faculty to provide instruction in geriatrics; Support continuing education of health professionals who provide geriatric care; and Provide students with clinical traini ng in geriatrics in nursing homes, chronic and acute disease hospitals, ambulatory care centers, and senior centers.

Burdick Progr am for Rural Interdisciplinary Training - Section 754 Funding Levels for the Quentin N. Burdick Program 2007 --The Quentin N. Burdick Program is designed to support the interdisciplinary education and training of health professional teams to enter into practice and/or remain in rural areas. Program goals are to: 70 Use new and innovative methods to t rain health care professionals to provide services in rural areas; Demonstrate and evaluate innovative interdisciplinary methods and models designed to provide access to cost-effective comprehensive health care; Deliver health care services to in dividuals residing in rural areas; Enhance the amount of relevant re search conducted concerning health care issues in rural areas; and Increase the recruitment and retention of health care practitioners in rural areas and make rural practice a more attractive choice for health care practitioners. To accomplish these goals, Quentin N. Burdick Programs: Provide interdisciplinary learning e xperiences for health professions students designed to enhance their un derstanding of the contribution that each discipline brings to the solution of health problems; Conduct educational workshops and activities in rural communities for health professionals and residents; and Provide information and awareness acti vities for students, grades K-12, concerning career opportunities in the health professions. Allied Health and Other Disciplines - Section 755 Funding Levels for the Allied Health and Other Disciplines Program FY 2002 $9,495,000 2007 $3,960,000 While the main intent of this section addresses the allied health professions, it also includes the education and training of podiatric physicians, chiropractors, and behavioral/mental health practitioners. Podiatric medicine training grants are used to support residency training programs that encourage primary care, especially for underserved, minority, and elderly populations and for persons with AIDS. Chiropractic demonstration grants help to build collaborative effort s between chiropractors and physicians for patient care and develop research pr otocols that will significantly expand documented research in the chiropracti c field. The Graduate Psychology Education Program addresses the interrela tedness of behavior and health and the critical need for integrated health care services. The program trains psychologists to work with underserved populations and emphasizes an 71 integrated approach to health care services that underscores the connection between behavior and health. Note: The FY 2006 budget for Allied Heal th and Other Disciplines funded the Chiropractic Demonstration Program an d the Graduate Psychology Education Program only. The Allied Health Projects and Podiatric Programs were not funded. The goal for the Allied Health Program is to increase the supply of allied health professionals, which is accomplished by supporting programs that train professionals, especially those most ne eded by the elderly; developing and supporting programs that enable the transition of baccalaureate graduates into an allied health profession and link academic centers to rural clinical settings through a community-based setting; suppo rting career advancement training programs for allied health professionals; supporting programs that provide clinical training sites in underserved or rural communities and interdisciplinary training to promote the effectiveness of allied health professionals in geriatric care; establishing centers that apply innovative models that link practice, education, and research around the allied health field; and providing financial assistance to allied health students in fields in which there is a demonstrated shortage and who agree to practice in a medically underserved community.

Do not require the Health Education and Training Centers Programs to meet criteria for self-sufficiency; and 8. Legislative authority for the Podiatric Medicine Program should be placed in Part D, Section 747 (discipline-specific programs for physicians). SECOND REPORT 1. Restructure Section 755 to specifically support allied health education and training programs (delete all other disci plines). Additionally, Sections 792 (Health Professions Data) and 799b sh ould be redefined to employ the new list of recognized a llied health professions. Create a new Section 756 to support chiropractic research and trai ning in addition to demonstration projects. Create a new Section 757 (through removal of Section 755b1j) to support behavioral mental health for graduate psychology education 73 (Section 757a), geriatric psychology education (Section 757b), and graduate social work education (Sec tion 757c). Section 758 should be created for reauthorization of the Advisory Committee on Interdisciplinary Community-Based Li nkages by moving the committee authorization from Section 756 to Section 758. Podiatric medicine should be removed from Part D Section 755b 2 and placed in Part C (family medicine, general internal medici ne, general pediatrics, physician assistants, general dentistry, and pediatric dentistry) and receive a separate appropriation from the allied health budget; 2. The Secretary should adopt measures to encourage collaboration among Title VII Interdisciplinary Training Grant Programs that enhances the diversity of the health professions educational pipeline, strengthens minority-serving institutions, and increases the development and exchange of culturally sensitive an d appropriate health information; 3. Congress and the Secretary should take action to strengthen the capacity of the Allied Health Program in Title V II, Part D, Section 755 of the Public Health Service Act by reserving Section 755 for allied health education and training for the full range of allie d health professions. Funds should be directed to those allied health professions demonstrating workforce shortages and serving unserved, underserved, and vulnerable populations; 4. Title VII Interdisciplinary Traini ng Grant Programs should receive funding to partner with other agen cies to educate and disseminate bioterrorism and emergency preparedness education and training; 5. The Secretary should stren gthen the capacity of Ti tle VII Interdisciplinary Training Grant Programs by creating new and enhancing existing linkages between these programs and federally qualified community health centers, rural health clinics, and the National Health Service Corps; and 6. The Secretary should appoint a memb er of the Advisory Committee on Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Linkages to the DHHS Rural Task Force. THIRD REPORT 1. The HRSA Administrator should convene national health professions associations to develop consensus regarding core competencies and curricula for bioterrorism and emergency preparedness; 2. Federal funding should be continued for quality continuing education in bioterrorism and emergency prep aredness for practicing health professionals in every State; 3. Federal funding should be available to develop new curricula or adapt existing curricula in bioterrorism and emergency preparedness for students in health professions schools; 74 4. Federal agencies should coordinate their efforts regarding bioterrorism and emergency preparedness and es tablish linkages with Title VII Interdisciplinary Training Grant Programs and State programs; 5. BHPr should work with other Federal agencies, such as the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office, to develop additional performance measures, including the use of qualitative data for Title VII Interdisciplinary Training Grant Programs that specifically evaluate impact on the community health status and economy; 6. Develop a process for sharing data fr om all Title VII Interdisciplinary Training Grant Programs within BHPr, among interested Federal agencies, and across the programs; and 7. Congress should appropriate funding for the purposes of evaluation, development of educational research models, and tracking long-term outcomes specific to Title VII Interd isciplinary Training Grant Programs. FOURTH REPORT Cross-Cutting Recommendations 1. Congress should reauthorize the Ti tle VII Interdisciplinary, Community- Based Training Grant Programs; 2. The Secretary and Congress should re quire Federal agencies, including the Department of Labor (DOL), the Department of Education (DOE), the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, the Centers for Disease Cont rol and Prevention (CDC) and others to establish formal funding-based links with HRSA to leverage the resources of the Title VII Interdi sciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs and to enhance their reach in the recruitment, training, and retention of the health workforce across the Nation; and 3. The Secretary and Congress should encourage linkages and collaboration between the National Advisory Committee on Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Linkages and DHHS, HRSA, BHPr and national advisory committees and commission s addressing similar topics. Cultural Competence and Diversity 4. The Secretary and Congress should include legislative language, applied uniformly, that requires Title V II Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs to address cultural competency; 5. The Secretary and Congress should include legislative language requiring Title VII Interdisciplinary, Communi ty-Based Training Grant Program grantees to address, as appropriate, faculty development in cultural and linguistic competence. This training should be done in partnership with students, when possible; 75 6. The Secretary and Congress should strengthen HRSA reporting requirements to include, where approp riate, the collection of qualitative and quantitative data relating to the cultural competence efforts of Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Ba sed Training Grant Programs; 7.

The Secretary and Congress should en courage Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Program grantees to form partnerships with providers at the State and local level to prepare a culturally competent and diverse workforce. Health Disparities 10. The Secretary and Congress should th rough legislative language mandate that HRSA reporting requirements in clude, where appropriate, collection of qualitative and quantitative data re lating to efforts carried out by Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Ba sed Training Grant Programs to contribute to a reduction in health disparities. Linkages should be established that provide access to other HRSA data sources related to health disparities to enhance assessmen t and evaluation activities of Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Program grantees; 11. The Secretary and Congress should through legislative language, applied uniformly, require Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs to address the recognition and elimination of health disparities; 12. The Secretary and Congress should through legislative language require Title VII Interdisciplinary, Communi ty-Based Training Grant Programs to provide educational and clinical experi ences for students, faculty, and/or practitioners that increase awarene ss and demonstrate how appropriate, evidenced-based interventions can be used in combination with other measures to identify and lessen health disparities unique to their region or local area; 13. Congress should restore funding for Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Prog rams to FY 2003 funding of $89.7 million. Further, the Committee encourages Congress to consider 76 additional funding of $50 million for these programs to enable programmatic growth to further the reduction of health disparities through the continued preparation of a diverse health workforce; and 14. Congress should appropriate $2 millio n to HRSA to conduct a study to investigate community health worker s/patient navigators in terms of: utilization and cost effectiveness; ed ucation and training expectations including career advancement pathwa ys; roles and responsibilities; and contributions to the reduction of health disparities. Health Workforce 15. The Secretary and Congress should en courage Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs to enhance the use of information technology (IT), tele-educa tion, and telehealth in education and training strategies in order to reach and retain health care professionals in remote and underserved areas; 16. The Secretary and Congress should in clude legislative language that requires Title VII Interdisciplinary , Community-Based Training Grant Programs to utilize strategies to pr omote effective participation and representation by members of underrepresented racial/ethnic groups to increase the diversity of the health care workforce and reduce health disparities and to improve recruitment, retention, and distribution of the health care workforce; 17. The Secretary and Congress should require the HRSA Administration to change the application review and progress report review criteria to emphasize the use of strategies aime d at increasing the diversity, recruitment, and retention of the health care workforce; 18. The Secretary and Congress should in clude legislative language that requires Title VII Interdisciplinary , Community-Based Training Grant Programs to design education and training programs that promote effective participation and representation by members of multiple health professions disciplines and their effect ive interdisciplinary interaction on behalf of patients, special populati ons, and/or diverse communities; 19.

The planning committee for the BHPr All Grantee meeting in June 2005 should consider creating a venu e to explore strategies to share information, data, and resources among BHPr grantees; and 22. Congress should expand the legislative authority of the Chiropractic Demonstration Projects Program to establish and include training programs to integrate chiropractic health care with other Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs. Health Workforce Pipeline 23. Funding should be appropriated to support a HRSA consensus conference to include, at a minimum, Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs, the National Health Service Corps, and Division of Health Care Diversity and Development Programs. The purpose of the conference will be to identify successful and effective program models that encourage, on an ongoing basis, children and young adults to consider a broad range of health careers; 24. Make a statutory change to all Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community- Based Training Grant Programs to permit, but not require, a portion of grant dollars to be utilized to focu s on pipeline programs encouraging young people to enter a full range of health careers; 25. The Secretaries of DHHS, DOE, and DOL should convene a meeting to develop collaborative approaches across their Departments to recruit, educate, and retain greater numbers of children and young adults (K-20) into the health professions. Special emphasis should be placed on program models that target students from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds; 26. The Committee encourages linkages and collaborations with DHHS, HRSA, BHPr, DOL, DOE, professional associations, and national committees and commissions that are addressing Kids into Health Careers; 27. An additional scholarship and/or loan repayment program should be established through BHPr that is based on community needs and workforce assessment and would appl y to the full range of health professions not currently supported by BHPr funding mechanisms. Based on the large number of health professions involved, the Committee recommends starting with an appropriation of $10 million; and 28. Additional funding should be alloca ted to Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs to support efforts in the development and maintenance of ac ademic enrichment programs for students in the health professions pipeline. 78 Faculty Development 29. The Secretary and Congress should auth orize and fund institutions with accredited health professions programs to meet the costs of projects to plan and develop interdisciplinary faculty development programs to include post-doctoral fellowships, scholarship, teaching, and service training for junior faculty, and mentoring and retention support through demonstration models; and provide financial assistance to fellows and faculty enrolled in such programs; and 30. The legislative language relating to geriatric faculty as currently enacted in Section 753 should be revised. Revise 753(b) to read: Geriatri c Training Regarding Physicians, Dentists, and Behavioral Health Professionals, including social workers and nurses. Revise 753(b) (3) (A) (iii) to read : Have completed graduate medical education or doctoral training in behavioral and mental health services, including social workers and nurses. Revise 753(b)(4)(c) to read: The term graduate and post-doctoral training in behavioral and mental health services means training experiences that include graduate t raining resulting in the PhD., an internship accredited by the Ameri can Psychological Association, and post-doctoral training that qualifies a person for designation as a health service provider. FIFTH REPORT Programmatic Recommendations 1. The Committee recommends that the statutory authorization of the Advisory Committee on Interdiscip linary, Community-Based Linkages be reauthorized; 2. The Secretary and Congress should amend Section 755(b)(3) to read, Carrying out demonstration projec ts in which chiropractors and physicians collaborate to identify and provide effective treatment for spinal and lower-back conditions or planning and implementing interdisciplinary projects for chiropractic students in programs collaborating with other health profe ssions and at least one allied health profession; 3. The Committee supports its previous recommendation to move podiatry to Section 747. The Committee requests an additional $1 million to support program development for podiatric students and residents to participate in interdisciplinary educatio n models as part of their education track; and 4. The Committee holds its previous recommendation in the Second Report that states, Create a new Section 757 (t hrough removal of Section 755(b) (1) 79 (j)) to support behavioral mental health for graduate psychology education (Section 757a), geriatric psychology education (Section 757b), and graduate social work education (757c). The Committee also requests an increase in appropriations to $7.7 million. Recommendations for Allied Health 5. The Secretary and Congress should a ppropriate funding, no less than the previous level of $35 million, under Ti tle VII, Section 755 specifically for allied health programs to support interdisciplinary, community-based education and training projects. With this additional funding, HRSA should consider funding traineeships as authorized under Section 755(b) (1) (i); 6. Congress should expand the legislative authorities in Title VII, Section 755(b) (1): Innovative projects designed to meet specifically defined and well justified local and regional allied health training needs; Faculty development demonstration grants to address severe faculty shortages in allied health profession programs including interdisciplinary, community-based faculty fellowships in allied health; Projects that establish partnershi ps with existing HRSA workforce centers to collect, analyze, and report data on the allied health workforce, access, and diversity and provide reports on workforce issues to Congress; Projects that provide incentives fo r partnerships with local higher education institutions such as 2-year community colleges, tribal colleges, historically black college s and universities (HBCUs), and Asian/Pacific Islander and/or Hispanic-serving institutions; Projects that provide rapid transi tion training programs in allied health fields to individuals who have certificate, associate, and baccalaureate degrees in health-related sciences; and Projects that expand or establish demonstration centers to emphasize best practices and innovative models to link allied health clinical practice, education, and research; and 7. Congress should enact the Allied Heal th Reinvestment Act (AHRA) with the inclusion of Title VII, Section 755 with the revisions proposed by this Committee in this report. Interdisciplinary Education and Training 8. The Committee recommends that th e following definition for interdisciplinary educational developm ent and training be used by BHPr for all Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs: 80 Interdisciplinary educational developm ent and training is defined as the collaborative process by which an interdisciplinary team of health care professionals\u2014faculty, clinical preceptors, community health care providers\u2014 collaborate, plan, and coordinate an int erdisciplinary program of education and training. The collaborative process requires the preparation and functioning of interdisciplinary teams who share knowledge and decision making with the purpose of creating solutions to health care problems that transcend conventional discipline-specific methods and work togeth er in service of patient-centered and/or community-centered health care needs. 9. BHPr should require through the gran t guidance application process that applicants describe the interdisciplinary learning objectives, identify the interdisciplinary competencies, descr ibe how these will be evaluated and measured in all Title VII Interdisci plinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs, and discuss plans for institutionalizing these interdisciplinary education and training projects; 10. BHPr should develop common in terdisciplinary performance and outcome measures to evaluate the effectiveness of interdisciplinary education and training programs funded by Title VII, Part D; 11. BHPr should support interdisciplinary education in all programs through its guidance, technical assistance, and creation of opportunities for mentorship, networking, and dissemin ation of best practice models; 12. Based on the growing body of eviden ce, including multiple Institute of Medicine (IOM) reports, that interdi sciplinary care results in increased patient satisfaction and improved health outcomes, the Committee recognizes the importance of interdi sciplinary education and training and recommends that BHPr facilitate a joint meeting of all appropriate advisory committees or advisory committee representatives to discuss interdisciplinary education and training; and 13. The Committee recommends that HRSA convene a consensus conference on interdisciplinary professional education and training or make interdisciplinary professional education and training a significant topic of the next BHPr all grantee meeting. SIXTH REPORT 1. The Secretary and Congress should provide incentives for colleges, universities, and health science center s to create and maintain permanent offices or departments of interdiscip linary health sciences (participating disciplines as defined by current HRSA guidelines) education; 2. The Secretary and Congress should su pport interdisciplinary geriatrics education/training programs for all professionals and paraprofessionals associated with community health centers, rural health clinics, or related networks and partnerships; 81 3. The Secretary and Congress should give greater attention to investments in programs that educate and trai n health care professionals and paraprofessionals through interd isciplinary and community-based programs designed to foster the delivery of quality care to underserved and medically compromised populations; 4. The Secretary and Congress should provide funding incentives and demonstration projects in support of education and training to develop interdisciplinary health professions education clinical teams in conjunction with community health center s, rural health clinics, and other providers in underserved areas, to improve capacity, encourage positive evidence-based outcomes, and enha nce the quality of health care; 5. The Secretary and Congress should support interdisciplinary community- based partnerships that provide ed ucation/training programs and/or demonstration projects addressing link s between oral heal th and systemic health; establish new models that include oral health as part of comprehensive preventive care; or provide data on the overall health economics impact of preventive oral health approaches; 6. The Secretary and Congress should address the need for workforce development, faculty development, clinical educator development, and access in interdisciplinary geriatrics an d gerontology to meet the need for trained professionals and paraprofessionals to provide care for older adults across the continuum of care settings; 7. The HRSA BHPr should provide Section 752 HETCs, Section 753 Education and Training Relating to Geriatrics, and Section 754 Quentin N. Burdick Program for Rural Interdiscip linary Training grantees funded in 2005 the option for no-cost extensions for up to 12 months to allow for effective use of funds and to preserve vital networks that are critical to addressing health care needs of some of the Nation's most vulnerable citizens; 8. The Secretary and Congress should support community-based linkages of health professions education program s with community health centers, rural health clinics, and other community-based sites in the development of a diverse workforce through educat ion and recruitment activities in both rural and urban medically underserved communities; and 9. The Secretary and Congress should recognize that community health workers are a valuable part of the safety net workforce and should provide funding preferences to interdisciplinary academic and community-based organizations that provide education to community health workers. 82 FUTURE DIRECTIONS of the COMMITTEE The Committee continues to evaluate and discuss a number of opportunities that will help to shape the course for future directions. As such , the Committee views the opportunity for a combined meeting of all of the advisory committees within the Bureau of Health Professions, spec ifically the Training in Primary Care Medicine and Dentistry, Council on Graduate Medical Education, and Nursing Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Practice, as an extraordinary opportunity for these groups of health professions to engage in a collaborative dialogue that focuses on the critical i ssues in health care, avoids duplicative efforts and offers effective, convincing recommendations to address concerns. Collectively, the health professions have an obligation and an ongoing social contract with society to engage in more efficient and effective teamwork in meeting current, prospective, and unanticipated health care needs. Potential topics of interest for discussion include health professions workforce shortages, advancing health professions training to meet future health care needs, and improving access by enhancing workforce diversity. Additionally, the Committee accepts its responsibility to ensu re the appropriate training of health professions in response to the emerging health care needs of the Nation. The Committee recognizes that these needs ma y be precipitated by man-made and natural disasters. The Committee has identified several areas of potential focus emphasizing best practices and models of interdisciplinary education that can be applied widely to health professions education. The Co mmittee will follow the established model of receiving and gathering data from testimony provided by experts and leaders in the field, offering inquiry and utilizing the expertise of its diverse members. In addition, the Committee will begin to use selected consultants to provide additional perspectives for the planning and developing of future reports. These acknowledged experts in their fields will provide brief documents or white papers that will be used to furth er inform and enhance the Committee discussion, as well as provide a framewo rk for a working annual report. Building on the foundation made available by the Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grants Program legislation, the Committee anticipates being more effective with its strategy in developing approaches that will advance the training opportunities for health professions. As the direct result of thoughtful dialogue designed to move toward consensus, specific recommendations with appropriate justifications will be generated and provided to the Secretary and the Congress. 83 PROMISING TOPICS Rural Health Care in the United States linked with the role of Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Traini ng Grant Programs in providing this health care in the future represents an important concern. This area is of interest especially for rural populations faced wi th growing influences of immigration, increasing numbers of older residents, and advancing numbers of veterans returning from recent conflicts througho u t t h e w o r l d . A s s u c h , t h i s i s t h e working topic selected for further exam ination by the Committee for its Eighth Annual Report to the Secretary and the Congress. Emphasis will be placed on addressing health workforce issues among rural and underserved populations including geriatric health care and care for veterans and their families. Expert testimony will provide perspectives about potential components of a comprehensive rural system of health care as well as workforce faculty and student education and training issues that ensure quality and understanding of policy and related fiscal concerns. The Role of Public Health in Association with Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community- Based Training Grant Programs in the Nation's Public Health System is another topic of relevance. The Committee continues to work to identify the role of health professionals in addressing public health workforce shortages. With the key role of public health, particularly in emerge ncy preparedness and bioterrorism, there are many opportunities for collaboration, development of effective partnerships and shared training that would su pport the Title VII programs. Faculty and Workforce Shortages Coupled with the Role of Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs represents another challenge. The accelerated need for increased numbers of highly educated health care professionals in concert with the limited resources of these higher educational systems and the lack of qualified academ ic and clinical faculty and educational leaders are causes for concern, if a well prepared workforce is to be available for the future. As such, innovative educ ational models are needed to promote interdisciplinary learning and practice during these complex and uncertain times. As relevant in years past as it is today, the Committee continues to be interested in Diversity in the Health Professions and the Role of Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs in enhancing the ethnic and racial diversity of the workforce. Critical to a high quality health care system is a diverse, well educated work force. 84 This has been a continuing priority of the Committee and has been addressed in previous reports in that diversity issu es and meaningful support of Title VII programs must be integrated into upcoming topic agendas as consistent priority areas of concern. Community Care Giving in Asso ciation with the Role of Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs in assisting with non-traditional family and community based health care surfaced as an area of concern. This is an example of the more creative thinking of the Committee. With the evolving health care system, much of the actual c are given to patients is provided through the family or community members. This is likely to continue in the future. There may be a substantial role for Ti tle VII programs as these community care givers must have a significant level of trai ning if they are to become competent in these care-giving roles. Ever present is Patient Safety Connected with the Role of Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs in identifying interdisciplinary models that prepare health professionals with the knowledge, skills, and moral courage to take responsibility for preventing errors. Safety concerns are shared across health professions and provide opport unities for collaboration and training consistent with Title VII programs. Most recently, the Concept of a Medical Home has captured the attention of the Committee members as an approach to de livering comprehensive primary health care services. Likewise, the medical home model directs the need for coordinating every aspect of a patient' s interdisciplinary plan of care. The Committee is interested in further expl oring how Title VII Interdisciplinary, Community-Based Training Grant Programs could effectively facilitate the direction of interdisciplinary education, training, and practice within medical homes. While certainly not all inclusive, the af orementioned topics and issues should help to shape the agenda for an ongoing debate that will result in the most appropriate decisions having the most po sitive influences on the health care outcomes for the medically under-served and un-served communities in this great Nation. The Committee remains poised to play a key role. 85 "}
