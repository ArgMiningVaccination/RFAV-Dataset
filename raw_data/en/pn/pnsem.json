However, they are not the only effective tools individuals have to help them combat their drug or alcohol addictions. Many therapies complement the more traditional modalities used in rehab to treat substance abuse and co-occurring disorders. Among these alternative treatments is a mindfulness meditation therapy program, a technique that has been used for centuries to promote wellness in all aspects of an individual's life. These two techniques, while similar, have slightly different emphases but can also work together. They help individuals see new approaches to challenging situations and make better decisions in those moments. At Bayview Recovery, we are proud to incorporate a wide range of holistic and evidence-based therapeutic options to ensure our client's recovery. Mindfulness meditation is one strategy we utilize in our treatment program. For more information about this unique addiction therapy program, please contact Bayview Recovery today at 855.478.3650. What Is a Mindfulness Meditation Therapy Program? Mindfulness refers to the cultivation of a keener awareness of the feelings, thoughts, and experiences individuals have in the moment. When an individual practices mindfulness, they notice but also accept all the observations they make about themselves, and the moment itself, without judgment. This acceptance helps to foster greater compassion for others, self-compassion, inner peace, and an attitude of non-reaction. These can help people in recovery release their tendencies to take substances when faced with a triggering situation. As with any practice, it takes time to learn to become mindful and a skilled practitioner of this discipline. The benefits are worth the effort, especially for those recovering from substance abuse. Mindfulness can be practiced any time a recovering individual needs to reground themselves. In addition, they can mitigate the fear and anxiety which could spur renewed drug use. As a result, this treatment can be an extremely useful technique to support other techniques learned during rehab, increasing the number of options they have to use to avoid a relapse. What Is Meditation? Meditation has been used to promote healing and well-being for centuries. During a mindfulness meditation therapy program, practitioners cultivate a sense of inner calmness by focusing their attention on a particular object or thought. Typically, practitioners of meditation sit in a comfortable, quiet place where they can be undisturbed for a short period of time, although practitioners can also meditate along with others in the same space or even while walking or driving. The versatility of this wellness practice makes it ideal for those in recovery since they can use the technique to collect themselves anywhere and anytime they face a challenging situation. It is especially important to set a specific time and place for their growing practice to strengthen their skills. They can also become confident enough to apply the technique when they need it. While meditation is taught and practiced by several religious traditions, it is not a religious practice, and individuals do not have to have or adopt a particular faith tradition to include meditation in their lives. A mindfulness meditation therapy program does offer spiritual benefits. For example, people who practice regularly generally feel more calm, centered, connected, and joyful as a result of meditation. In addition, they enjoy improved and more satisfying relationships, which can enhance all aspects of their lives. How Do Mindfulness and Meditation Therapies Work Together? Mindfulness and meditation help individuals increase their awareness of their thoughts and feelings, giving them a greater ability to respond to situations as they arise and more opportunities to make better decisions. By living in the moment rather than clinging to the past or worrying about the future, individuals can release the habits they have long held. These habits may have sustained their addiction and the patterns of negative thinking. What Are the Benefits of Mindfulness and Meditation Therapies During Rehab? Individuals diagnosed with one or more mental health concerns can derive many benefits from mindfulness and meditation therapies. Conditions which can be treated with these holistic therapies include: Mindfulness and meditation have a wide-ranging number of benefits which include: Better focus More satisfying relationships Increased life satisfaction Improved memory Better digestion A stronger immune system Sounder sleep Greater self-awareness Gains in creativity Lower blood pressure Are Mindfulness and Meditation Therapies Effective in Substance Abuse Treatment? Mindfulness and meditation therapies are highly effective. They give individuals in recovery ways to avoid compulsive behaviors that can lead to relapse.

One study, for example, published in the journal Substance Abuse in 2009, shows that individuals who had mindfulness treatment exhibited a decreased incidence of substance use compared to individuals who had traditional 12 Step treatment. Further, when individuals in the mindfulness group switched to 12 Step treatment, their incidence of substance use increased. There is significant scientific and anecdotal evidence to support the benefits of mindfulness and meditation treatment. Especially when given to clients alongside traditional treatment formats.
