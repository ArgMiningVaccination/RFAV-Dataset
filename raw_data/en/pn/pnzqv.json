Medically speaking, balancing hormones has proven to be complex. As more men and women search for alternatives to pharmaceuticals, and surgery, Chinese medicine offers a more holistic approach that balances the Earth element and the cumulative physiological effects of stress. The Earth element is related to digestive force and can support healthy reproduction and balance hormones. This is achieved through proper diet and acupuncture. Together, both acupuncture and proper nutrition help strengthen digestion and aid in the assimilation of nutrients that support proper hormonal balance. Here are a few tips to help you strengthen your digestion: - Limit cold drinks and foods - Chew food thoroughly - Eat more cooked foods - Limit meat and dairy (always eat animal protein with vegetables) - Avoid food combinations that produce blotting and gas like, proteins and grains in the same meal - Eat more fermented foods and probiotic drinks - Explore adding digestive enzymes and probiotics Hormonal imbalances however, are not only related to dietary issues and are commonly not an isolated problem. It's important to remember that hormonal problems do not appear overnight and in a number of cases imbalances can be a result of a malfunction with the ovaries or other endocrine system factors. Most commonly however, the problems are a direct result of poor lifestyle and dietary factors. Often hormonal issues are directly related to our daily stress responds. \"The more stress we are under the more our cortisol levels are unbalanced. Not only is cortisol our primary stress hormone, it is a primary hormone in general helping our body convert food into energy, normalize blood sugar, respond to stress and maintain our immune system's inflammatory response.\" 1 Live style changes, proper nutrition and balancing hormones via acupuncture can often get our hormones functioning right again and are a great first step in holistically addressing hormonal imbalances. Here are just a few types of stresses that can negatively affect the way our body's hormones function: - Eating a highly processed diet - Relationship or family problems - Financial trouble - Job loss - Too much work - Exposure to chemicals and toxins in your environment - Constant depletion of antioxidants or not getting enough from our diet Are you're struggling with hormonal issues that manifest as a declining libido, low energy, PMS, infertility, migraines/headaches and or sleep problems? I invite you to explore how Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine can be the first safe step in supporting you holistically without the side effects of drugs or the dangers of surgery.
