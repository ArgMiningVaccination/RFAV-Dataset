Besides helping drivers with human needs such as lack of food and money, the chaplains offer Bibles, video and audio tapes, Christian literature, and counselling.

Doctors consider alternative medicine to include, among other things, relaxation techniques, herbal medicine, massage, chiropractic therapy, and spiritual healing. Massage and chiropractic treatment account for about 50% of alternative treatment visits.
