As of June 1, vaccinations and negative Covid tests are no longer required for participation in our programs. If you are not feeling well, especially if you have any viral symptoms, please stay home and contact us to receive a refund. As the pandemic continues to evolve, we continue to update our policy to protect those who choose to join our in-person programs. Data always lags behind the need for information, so we do our best to make decisions with the information we have. We base our precautions on the current information from the Federal, State and Local Governments, as well as the advice of medical professionals. We encourage everyone to consider their own circumstances and take appropriate precautions. See below for more information on how we are addressing this pandemic. Policy Masks are optional Everyone is welcome to wear a mask over their nose and mouth inside the building. Stay home if you aren't feeling well, and other general hygiene Full refunds will be given for anyone not able to attend due to health concerns. Always wash your hands well (for 20 seconds) and limit touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Context As of May 12, 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared that the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE) for COVID-19, under Section 319 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, has expired. As of May 14, 2023 Massachusetts positive testing rates are at 2.97% according to the [ Mass.Gov reporting trend page](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting). There seems to be low risk of transmission, which is supported by [wastewater data](https://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm). We recognize that not everyone shares the same risk profile, and long term complications from COVID-19 seem to be common. Precautions such as vaccination, testing, distancing when feasible, staying home when sick, and general hygiene are still helpful. Many people are still at high risk, and some people may choose to continue to wear masks or to stay home and participate virtually. Please support these people to participate in whatever way they feel most comfortable. In an attempt to balance the risks of illness with the social needs for human connection, to stay in line with other local guidelines, and to recognize the wide variation in risk profiles, we have developed the above harm-reduction policy. We hope this will allow people to make informed decisions and participate in the programs and settings that are appropriate to them. If you have questions or concerns about the policy, please feel free to reach out to the Center's Executive Director [Max Roberts-Zirker](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#38555940784b5059555a505954595a574b4c575616574a5f).

View Response to this situation can be framed in regard to societal health, going beyond the fear of our own personal situations and practicing care for others - particularly those more vulnerable. Each of us is subject to the countless external interactions we've experienced, and to some extent, that is out of our control. We can control our responses, and those efforts can influence the spread of the disease. This is the focus or our response. Mitigating the spread has a powerful ripple effect on the society at large: If we practice protective measures, our effort will buy time and resources for health care providers to handle the expected growth of cases. If those cases stay below the capacity limit, then they will be able to keep themselves and us safe. The red spike in cases above is a worst-case scenario for health providers. It's so critical to not burn out our health care workers! Contemplation In such times of concern, noticing our our personal tendencies to amplify or downplay, continuing to practice - whether together or at home - are valuable, grounding and remind us of our larger perspective. We can work as a community to reduce the spread and intensity of coronavirus within our sphere of control, which is the Boston Shambhala Center facility itself. We are working to encourage coordinators and participants in gateway programs to clean and disinfect potential contact surfaces daily. Action - All shared utensils will be washed through the dishwasher. Hand washing is not sufficient to sanitize. Detailed instructions on how to handle overflows are being developed, and will be posted in this document.. - Program participants will be encouraged to help disinfect the center daily. "}
