Workforce burnout .'' \u2014The Wellness Troll The ability to predict clinical and operational outcomes at the work setting level is essential in health care quality improvement. Health care worker (HCW) well-being is one of a small handful of work setting variables with this potentpower. Similar to leadership concerns about stafng levels, from an operational perspective it is helpful to think of HCW well-being as workers' ability to ''get the work done '' and to be ready for the next task or challenge. We will take a deep dive into well-being, and in particular the variable of HCW emotional exhaustion as an essential metric predictiveof clinical and operational outcomes, as well as patient and HCW outcomes. To manage and understand a workforce, it is instructive to assess and improve workforce well-being.Before the global pandemic of 2020 placed an even greater strain on busy and stressed HCWs, the impact and consequences of HCW burnout had already captured theattention of national and international health care leaders.Organizations that have come out with formal statementsaround the need to address burnout include the World Health Organization, the National Academy of Medicine, the Combined Critical Care Societies, the AccreditationCouncil for Graduate Medical Education, and manyothers. 1-4The alarm bells have rung loudly for several years in fact, but the existing peer-reviewed literature does not provide a clear road map for leaders struggling to make evidence-based decisions. A PubMed search on ''burnout '' during the last 2 decades reveals the number of burnoutarticles published each year in the medical literature have increased more than 6-fold, with an even more rapid rise in the last 3 years. Remarkably, out of more than 16 000published articles on burnout in the medical literature, thereare fewer than 50 randomized controlled trials focused oninterventions to improve burnout in HCWs. Many of these are classied as pilot studies, and almost all have small numbers ( ,100 participants) or limited follow-up. Many more articles discuss the prevalence or epidemiology ofburnout, postulating about potential causes but withminimal data to support theories, and with little direction on potential solutions. Perhaps it should not be surprising that this paucity of evidence scattered throughout theliterature interferes with leadership efforts to manageworkforce well-being coherently and effectively. Given the scarcity of high-quality articles investigating HCW burnout, this review seeks to detail the environmentaland psychologic factors that drive the pathophysiology of burnout, and to synthesize the existing evidence supporting effective tools to reduce burnout and improve HCW well-being.

These efforts have supplied one of the largestexisting data sets for HCW well-being, providing us new insight and perspectives to add to the existing literature on tools to improve well-being. Our hope is that this reviewmay serve as a framework for HCWs, administrators, andresearchers to HCW well-being, of HCW well-being we will discuss theterminology, prevalence, causes, interventions, and thefuture of work in this eld. OVERVIEW OF BURNOUT, POSITIVE EMOTION, AND WELL-BEING TERMINOLOGY The classic denition of burnout, as dened by Dr Christina Maslach, is a psychologic syndrome involvingemotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a diminishedsense of personal accomplishment. 5Similar to other psychological syndromes, burnout subsequently affectscognitive processing, coloring how individuals process and interact with their everyday world. A simpler and broader conceptualization that we use in our research is that burnout is the impaired ability to experience the restorative effects ofpositive emotions . 6,7In fact, burned-out individuals will tend to focus on the negative things happening around them, atthe expense of noticing positive events. 8 Positive Emotion Just as depression and anxiety have been linked to lower levels of positive emotions,9,10the same has been found for burnout.11Research has consistently shown that experienc- ing positive emotion is a causal link in the chain of feelinggreater purpose 12and recovery after emotional upheavals.13 Positive emotions, like hope, serve to effectively rechargeour depleted batteries. 14,15In controlled experiments, positive emotions demonstrably undo the cardiovascularsequelae of an emotional upheaval relative to negative emotions and control groups. 16Our characterization of burnout as the impaired ability to experience the restorativeeffects of positive emotions incorporates extensive researchinto positive emotions and offers insight into mechanismsresponsible for burnout increasing or decreasing because ofevents or interventions. What explains changes in burnout? Since 2001, the job demands-resources model 17has demonstrated with relative precision that increasing demands while decreasing re-sources creates strain on the workforce. 18This strain has been called burnout, low engagement, compassion fatigue,moral distress, low-safety culture, and other similarmonikers. Interestingly, when there is an increase inresources that is commensurate with demands, the level ofstrain reported by the workforce is average, rather than high, demonstrating how understanding the 2 fundamental principles of demands and resources is critical to under-standing well-being in the workforce. Positive emotions, like gratitude, interest, and serenity, help people build personal resources , such as social bonds, intellectual skills, and motivation for personal growth. 19 When access to positive emotions is interrupted, throughnew or increasing demands, we end up going to work eachday with less and less well-being. This is not weakness onthe part of the person, it is the failure of our health caresystems to create environments that promote well-being in the workforce. To illustrate the job demands-resources model, think of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Itcreated new demands on HCWs as serious stressors to mental health, including social isolation, fear of contracting the disease, economic strain, unexpected homeschooling, and uncertainty about the future. The pandemic has alsopresented new resources to HCWs, through frequent and surprisingly meaningful opportunities for HCWs to see the inherent value of their work, to powerfully connect withpatients, to be appreciated and seen as heroes, to exercise asense of agency, and to experience deep camaraderie among their colleagues and connection to their organization. It is currently unknown if these and other unexpected resourcesduring the COVID-19 pandemic will be enough to buffer against the strain that leads to burnout when demands outpace resources. As we discuss burnout and well-being, it is important that we also properly dene related terms that are often used incorrectly or interchangeably. Resilience is not simply the absence of burnout but is a state of psychologic healthallowing an individual to cope with and recover from apsychological insult. Resilience is a function of the ability to cope, and the availability of resources related to health and well-being. 20In other words, well-being is driven by individual-level factors/interventions and organizational (environmental) level factors/interventions, as we will see in those sections under the heading Addressing Burnoutbelow. Another frequent question is whether burnout and depression are the same construct. Although burnout has similar characteristics and may be a risk factor fordepression, most researchers view burnout and depression as 2 distinct constructs with distinct criteria and features. Depression is a psychologic condition, characterized byeither a one-time or recurrent episode of daily depressedmood coupled with symptoms such as anhedonia, feelings of worthlessness, fatigue, or changes with appetite or sleep. 21Burnout is an occupational phenomenon, dened in the 11th revision of the International Classication of Diseases (ICD-11) as a syndrome resulting from ''chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. ''21 The ICD-11 goes on to describe the dimensions of burnout tting with Dr Maslach's original denition, including feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion, increased mental distance from one's job or feelings of negativism or cynicismrelated to one's job, and reduced professional efcacy. In our own work, we have found that burnout and depression are moderately (but not perfectly) correlated from 0.40 to 0.57across large and diverse data sets, 6,22which is similar to the 0.52 correlation reported in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis.23Although we agree that burnout and depression appear to share some common features (eg, lossof interest and impaired concentration), it is important to note that there is signicantly less stigma associated with burnout than with depression, such that HCWs are muchmore willing to seek out and use resources for burnout thanfor depression. Also, although depression is viewed as an ''individual ''problem, our empirical operationalization of burnout as ''reduced access to positive emotions ''highlights the impact of the work environment on groups of people. This acknowledgment implies a shared responsibility between the individual and the organization and providesinsight toward potential solutions for burnout. 1096 Arch Pathol Lab Med\u2014Vol 145, September 2021 The Science of Health Care Worker Burnout \u2014Rehder et alMEASURING BURNOUT AND ASSESSING THE PREVALENCE AND CONSEQUENCES OF BURNOUT IN HCWS To assess well-being as a multidimensional construct, researchers often use diverse sets of psychometrically valid metrics for domains such as burnout, depression, work-life balance, and subjective well-being.24,25Currently, the most common method to measure burnout is the Maslach Burnout Inventory, rst described in 1981.26Having withstood the test of time, this psychometrically valid and widely used survey27assesses the 3 separate components of burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment, the latter often equated to job satisfaction. Unlike its sibling domains of depersonalization and low personal accomplishment, emotional exhaustion heralds several unique attributes, and it is generally the most widely used domain of the Maslach Burnout Inventory. First, emotional exhaustion alone has shown adequate reliability for individual-level measurement.28Second, it has been used to discriminate between burned-out and non-burned- out outpatients experiencing work-related neurasthenia (according to the ICD, 10th revision criteria, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-V).29,30Third, according to a psychometric meta-analysis, emotional exhaustion consistently producesthe largest and most consistent coefcient aestimates (indicating that the items in the scale group together very well to assess the underlying construct). 31 To reduce participant respondent burden when multiple domains of well-being are being assessed, a 5-item derivative of the original 9-item emotional exhaustion scale is often used. This 5-item version is reliable ( a\u00bc.92)32 when used on HCWs,6,7,33-35predicts prevalence of disruptive behaviors among HCWs as well as symptoms of depression,22and is consistently associated with HCW work-life balance.22,32,36The HCW emotional exhaustion assessments with this 5-item version are also associated with improvement readiness (the capacity of HCWs to initiate and sustain quality improvement initiatives)34and the use of Patient Safety Leadership WalkRounds.33 Importantly for this review, HCW assessments using thisscale are consistently responsive to interventions. 33For a guide to assessing burnout, interpreting results, and benchmarking information, please see the supplementaldigital content at https://meridian.allenpress.com/aplm in the September 2021 table of contents. The flip side of emotional exhaustion would be positively valenced measures of well-being, and historically have been used relatively infrequently on HCWs. Importantly, the absence of something bad does not equate to the presence of something good. Low burnout in a work setting does not necessarily mean that HCWs are thriving, and interest in assessing this positive side of well-being has grown considerably in recent years. Finding that existing scales did not adequately capture positively valenced well-being in a health care environment, we developed and validated novel resilience scales. 6Psychometric analyses revealed 2 domains of resilience: The rst is Emotional Thriving, which asks about the level of flourishing of a respondent (eg, ''I have a chance to use my strengths every day at work '') and is akin to the opposite of Emotional Exhaustion. The second is Emotional Recovery, which assesses the extent to which one is able to ''bounce back ''from adversity or emotionalupheavals (eg, ''My mood reliably recovers after frustrations and setbacks ''). Emotional Recovery and Emotional Thriving only share about 10% of their variance, so being good at recovery does not ensure thriving, and vice versa (further information can be found in the supplemental digital content). Prevalence Recent data suggest the mean prevalence of physician burnout in the United States is estimated between 40% and 50%.37Not surprisingly, there is substantial variation by unique specialties and countries.38-40There is also signicant variation due to differing burnout denitions and thresholds used across studies. The rate of burnout in US physicians is about 1.5 to 2.5 times higher than it is for US workers inother professions. 37,41Notably, a career in medicine stands in contrast to other highly educated workers: in other professions, years of education after college is associatedwith reduced burnout, whereas the opposite is true for physicians. 41Similar to physicians, a wide range of reported burnout prevalence exists for nurses by specialty, worksetting, and country. Best estimates report mean nursing burnout in a similar but slightly lower range to physicians, somewhere between 35% and 45%, 42-47yet this may be notably higher or lower within different subspecialties or work settings. Fewer data exist for the prevalence of burnoutin other health care professions; however, available evidence suggests burnout is not substantially different for other roles, such as therapists or technologists. 6,22,48Most impor- tantly, measuring burnout of large populations may be useful for benchmarking and for monitoring trends, but because burnout varies widely by work setting, it is moreimportant for leaders to understand the local burnout rate in any given work setting. Severity The negative effects of burnout on individuals are somewhat intuitive, and they include job dissatisfactionand intent to leave the profession, 49intent to leave current job, poor sleep, lower-quality interpersonal relationships, poorer immune function, depression, and suicide, and evendecreased lifespan. 50-54The impact of burnout goes well beyond just the negative effects on HCWs themselves. Burnout in health care is extremely costly, with 1 study conservatively estimating the nancial toll of increased turnover and reduced productivity at $4.6 billion in theUnited States alone. Moreover, burnout hurts almost every aspect of work culture and a HCW's ability to care for patients. 55Burnout has been associated with many areas of quality and safety, including poorer relationships with patients, medical errors, infections, hospital admissions, mortality, and patient dissatisfaction.56-64In 1 particular study, after controlling for severity of illness, nurse-patient ratio, and other confounding factors, nurse burnout was the only remaining variable associated with patient mortality.57 In a large data set of 831 work settings from 31 hospitals in Michigan, we found that when you compare work settings by emotional exhaustion quartiles, higher rates of emotionalexhaustion were consistently associated with lower team- work and safety norms, lower ratings of local leaders, poorer work-life balance, and higher levels of burnout in their peers(''burnout climate ''; Figure 1). In other words, an emotional exhaustion score is a potent indicator of safety culture and workforce well-being. Arch Pathol Lab Med\u2014Vol 145, September 2021 The Science of Health Care Worker Burnout \u2014Rehder et al 1097Pathophysiology of Burnout The contributors to burnout and well-being are multifac- torial, but the key drivers of burnout can be thought of in 2 main categories: institutional factors and individual (orpersonal) factors. Institutional factors include the character-istics of the work environment, including work culture, workschedule, growth opportunities, participation in decision- making, peer support, and prioritized opportunities to cultivate well-being (eg, potlucks, happy hour, groupdebriefs around stressful events). Individual contributorsinclude such factors as self-care (eg, yoga, meditation,exercise, fatigue management), one's ability to cultivatemeaning, work-life balance, and having supportive rela- tionships (Figure 2). A lack of these factors predicts vulnerability to burnout, whereas having these factorsappears to prevent and help reduce burnout. 65,66Therefore, as we will discuss in more detail below, it is not surprisingthat institutional and individual interventions are often aimed at increasing these factors. For many clinicians, it can be helpful to think about burnout akin to a microbiologic disease process. In thisanalogy, burnout is the disease, the environment is thepathogen, and an individual's resilience is the immune system. As such, an individual who works in a particularlytoxic work environment (ie, aggressive pathogen) is at riskof getting sick independent of their personal resilience,whereas an individual with poor resilience (ie, immunosup- pressed) may be at risk for burnout even in supportive environments. This concept may help understand whydifferent individuals may or may not develop the signs ofburnout when experiencing similar challenges. When considering this analogy, it is often natural to think of our environment as the pathogen that is always wearingon us, leading to burnout. However, some features of workand home environments bolster our resilience, in the samemanner as a live attenuated vaccine prepares the immunesystem against future assaults. These work environments may be characterized by meaningful work with recognition from leaders, opportunities for personal growth, colleagueswho are considerate and supportive, and leaders whopromote autonomy, psychologic safety, and adaptability.Factors outside of the work environment that buildresilience include personal physical and mental health, family dynamics, and meaningful social interactions.Figure 1.

In their articles, 2,67these authors espouse a populist approach to burnout, demanding that somebody x the system, the medical record, stafng, and workflow. These perspectiveshave validity, in that system issues are a signicantcontributor to burnout. However, we believe this approach is incomplete in its scope of needed actions. To promote well-being, we must x both the system and help the peoplein need who suffered from that system. From the evidenceof HCW burnout prevalence reported earlier, one-third toone-half of our health care workforce is struggling with burnout right now. System xes will help prevent future burnout, but there are HCWs currently suffering who needhelp. Passions run high around this topic, so do not besurprised when at a meeting about burnout you hear a frustrated HCW shout: ''Don't talk about burnout, you just x the system! ''If you are leading well-being efforts in your organization, expect these interactions, listen with compas-sion, and learn where they are coming from. When looking for solutions to bolster HCW well-being, leaders can look at the underlying causes of burnout to identify solutions.Moreover, because of the variable causes of burnout, it isimportant to recognize that no single intervention will work to prevent burnout in all workers. Therefore, it is important to understand the factors at play in each work environmentbefore selecting any specic organizational intervention.Otherwise, leaders may devote time and resources to anintervention only to later learn that it was a temporary x or ultimately made no difference in staff burnout. For example, patient safety leader walkrounds (discussed below) mayhave minimal effect in a work setting that already has astrong safety culture, but robust effects on another work setting down the hall. Similarly, it is important to note that burnout frequently results from cumulative stressors; therefore, single inter- ventions may not be as effective as combined interventions, or opportunities for HCWs to choose among interventions.As health care leaders look to improve burnout in theirworkforce, it is important that they take a comprehensive approach to both organizational and individual factors driving well-being. Ignoring organizational contributorsand potential solutions to burnout not only leaves importantdrivers of burnout unaddressed, but it also risks sending the message that an individual is only burned out because they are not strong or resilient enough. Such messages onlycompound the underlying problem by making individualsfeel unsupported by their leaders and powerless to make positive changes in their workplace. Similarly, a signicant portion of the workforce will not be able to address theirown burnout through workplace interventions alone, andan added focus on personal interventions should enhancethe effectiveness of organizational resilience efforts. Corral- ling and understanding the well-being offerings and resources at work settings, departmental, institutional, andhealth system levels is no small task. At Duke University (Durham, North Carolina), it took us more than 2 years just to catalogue and assemble all of our well-being resources in one place, and it is constantly in need of updating. It isworthwhile to classify resources as organizational or individual in nature because this facilitates the ability of leaders to promote and support more comprehensive well-being efforts that afford options to HCWs. Two meta-analyses of interventions to reduce burnout in HCWs demonstrate that organizational interventions tar- geting the work environment and interventions targetingindividuals each have benets in reducing burnout. 68,69Each of these studies also demonstrates a larger potential cumulative benet with organizational interventions whencompared to the interventions focused on individualsincluded in their studies. Unfortunately, these organization- al interventions tend to be more resource intensive than personal interventions and may also be more difcult tosustain. Organizational Interventions Organizational support of well-being is primarily focused on making systematic changes to the work environment, including work demands and resources, work schedules, and interactions with leaders and with colleagues. Organi-zational interventions also typically target aspects of the work environment that an individual has minimal ability to change, outside of being in a leadership position. Workload, Workflow, and Work-Life Balance. \u2014The intensity of demands on HCWs has often been cited as a primary contributor to the increase in HCW burnout in recent years. 38,70,71In addition to the 24/7 nature of health care, which disrupts personal and family life, the growingmedical and social complexity of patients, increased documentation demands through electronic medical record systems, nancial constraints, and lack of administrativesupport for clerical tasks all add to a HCW's daily workload. In fact, physicians who are burned out are more likely to regulate their own workload by voluntarily decreasing theirclinical effort over the next 48 months. 72 Improving workload by streamlining workflow or adding clinical support is one of the most common strategies for burnout reduction, particularly for physicians. Severalstudies have shown improvement in burnout through interventions in targeting workload. 72,73Examples of inter- ventions include addition of advance practice providers ormedical assistants, offloading clerical tasks, streamliningpatient flow through the clinic, additional time per patient visit, or reducing patient-nurse ratios. 73-75 Although increased demands and frustrations with work- flow undoubtedly contribute to HCW burnout, the job demands-resources model details that it is not simply increased workload that drives burnout. Burnout occurswhen those increased demands are not paired withincreased resources and support from the organization. Leaders can leverage this knowledge to support well-being by ensuring balancing new demands on HCW time with anincrease in allocated resources that will improve workflow or workload. Work-life imbalance is another intuitive contributor to HCW well-being that has been supported by data. 32,36 Burnout has been linked to hours worked, number of nights spent in the hospital, longer duration shifts, and consecutive days worked.76-79Unfortunately, the data on work-life balance and burnout are inconsistent,80and in Arch Pathol Lab Med\u2014Vol 145, September 2021 The Science of Health Care Worker Burnout \u2014Rehder et al 1099particular, the addition of work hour limitations for physician trainees has not made a signicant impact on burnout rates.81 Burnout has frequently been shown to be higher in women (approximately 20%-60% increased odds of higherburnout) compared with men. 82,83These effects are likely due to increased household and child care demands along with greater dissatisfaction around work-life balance.84With higher numbers of women entering the health care eld in recent years, rates of gender differences in burnout are diminished.85Age is also associated with burnout, with younger HCWs reporting approximately double the risk ofthose 55 years or older. Higher levels of educational debt, 86 younger age of children, and having a spouse/partner who isnot a HCW are also correlated with burnout. 87Leaders, medical schools, and health care systems may benet from policies (eg, robust antidiscrimination and bullying; equita- ble pay) and programs (eg, bias training) designed tospecically counteract some of the culturally ingrainedbarriers to well-being. 88 A broader view of associations between personal wellness and burnout89has led many health systems to start wellness programs for their employees. Most recently, a largerandomized controlled trial of a wellness program for more than 4000 employees across 20 hospitals (compared with a much larger control group) demonstrated improved self-reported exercise and weight control but no difference in clinical or employment outcomes. 59This, along with mixed data on the effects of work hours and the poor sustainabilityof many workflow interventions, highlights the challenge ofmany organizational interventions for personal well-being: their success depends on a substantial investment of organizational resources, and unless appropriately targeted,promoted, and sustained, they may not result in the desired effect. Improving HCW Voice and Agency. \u2014For HCWs to feel engaged, it is important that they have a voice in decisionsthat are made in their work area, as well as a degree of autonomy concerning their work schedule or environment. Once these highly trained professionals feel like cogs in awheel rather than partners, engagement drops and burnout climbs. 38,90-92To combat the lack of engagement that occurs when staff feel they have no voice in the workplace, leaderscan focus on interventions to start a dialogue with andempower frontline workers. One specic intervention that has shown success in this area is leader walkrounds, originally pioneered by Frankel et al 93and later modied by Pronovost et al94as a method for executives to promote and support quality improvement efforts. Staff participation in leader walkrounds has been associated with improvedsafety culture 93,95and reduced burnout,96particularly when feedback is provided afterwards.33 Intentionally involving staff in decision-making and problem-solving is another strategy to empower HCWs byleveraging resources for HCWs. Participation in decision-making is an engagement variable that we measure during safety culture assessments, and we have found strong positive correlations with safety culture and well-beingdomains, such as improvement readiness, local leadership, teamwork climate, safety climate, emotional exhaustion, burnout climate, growth opportunities, and career advance-ment. 33Involvement in quality improvement projects has been associated with decreased burnout,73despite the potential to add workload to participants. The sense of agency that comes from working to solve some of theeveryday problems that drive burnout appears to counteract the effects of that burnout. The caveat, however, is that you should offer well-being resources, role model their use, and make options accessible to HCWs in work settingsstruggling with burnout before asking them to show up early and stay late for new quality improvement-related projects. Staff Support. \u2014Similar to having some voice and control in the workplace, a sense that local leadership and the organization ''has your back ''can have a profound impact on workers' daily experience and perceptions of work. 92 Perceptions of local leadership affect staff well-being, suchthat each 1-point gain in composite leadership rating correlates with a 3.3% decrease in likelihood of burnout. 90 We have similarly found that HCW assessments of effective leadership predict lower emotional exhaustion rates (J.B.S. unpublished data, July 2020). Leadership support is partic- ularly important when an error, an unexpected badoutcome, or a crisis unrelated to patient care has led to a''second victim. '' 97The concept of the second victim has been most commonly used in the setting of medical errors, describing the patient who experienced the medical error asthe primary victim and the HCW involved in the error as the second victim. Second victims often report feelings of guilt, shame, moral distress, professional inadequacy, and symp-toms of burnout, 98and in some cases symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.99Second victims might also fear punitive action or leave the profession altogether.100 Although involvement in preventable adverse events is associated with higher burnout, a study of more than 1000 nurses found that higher levels of support from manage- ment, nurse peers, and physician colleagues bufferedagainst this association. 101The HCWs who report that their organization supports second victims report signicantly lower emotional exhaustion and better safety culture.102 Interactions With Colleagues. \u2014Improving teamwork can have profound effects on HCW interactions withcolleagues and their overall work environment. Health care worker well-being has been shown in multiple studies to correlate with the teamwork climate of their work set-ting. 32,33,36,92,96,103In a further proof of concept, work settings have seen improvements in staff well-being following team training interventions.104,105 One particular aspect of teamwork and work environment that can have a profound effect on mood is rudeness or incivility from coworkers or patients.106A large study of almost 8000 HCWs demonstrated those who are routinelyexposed to rudeness or incivility in their work environment report signicantly higher levels of emotional exhaustion and depression than those not exposed to these samebehaviors. 22These disruptive behaviors contribute to a negative work culture, increasing the risk for burnout, including staff turnover, poorer teamwork, and growing distrust in leadership. Organizational efforts to combatdisruptive behaviors include formal professionalism pro- grams, policies that are clear, predictable, and enforced, and engaged leaders who are willing to have difcult conversa-tions. The rst step is a culture where it is psychologicallysafe to discuss and provide feedback around these behaviors. 107Peer messenger programs have then been successfully used as a nonpunitive method to reduce theincidence of routine disruptive behaviors, saving punish- ment for recurrent or egregious infractions. 108 Meaning in Work. \u2014Furthermore, to maintain engage- ment and avoid burnout, individuals need to experience 1100 Arch Pathol Lab Med\u2014Vol 145, September 2021 The Science of Health Care Worker Burnout \u2014Rehder et almeaning and purpose in their work. This meaning can come in different forms: seeing that daily work is tied to a greaterpurpose, witnessing progress toward a shared goal, or receiving recognition for excellence. It can also be through opportunities for personal development, such that dailywork is not just a job but a career with opportunities forpersonal growth and advancement. 38,89,90 Professional coaching or mentoring is 1 method to ght burnout by building interest and engagement throughpersonal growth and development. 77,109One randomized study demonstrated that 6 coaching sessions improvedemotional exhaustion, quality of life, and resilience scores inthe intervention group compared with the control group at5-month follow-up (Figure 3). 110Although these improve- ments were substantial, the intervention did not reducedepersonalization or improve job satisfaction or engage- ment in work. The researchers note that although coaching appears useful it is not a replacement for organizationalapproaches to improve the work environment in an effort toreduce burnout and dissatisfaction. This is importantresearch to help understand how to impact emotionalexhaustion, but at $1400 per participant, it is an interventionthat is likely out of reach for many. Schwartz Rounds were developed by the Schwartz Center for Compassionate Healthcare to ''offer healthcare providers a regularly scheduled time during their fast-paced work livesto openly and honestly discuss the social and emotionalissues they face in caring for patients and families. '' 111These multidisciplinary case conferences discuss the psychosocialaspects of difcult cases, both from the patient perspective and the HCW perspective. Health care workers who have attended Schwartz rounds report reduced stress, improvedinteractions with colleagues, improved ability to deal withthe psychosocial aspects of care, and increased sense ofshared purpose, with likely dose effect for repeat atten-dance. 112-115It is reasonable to expect that similar gains might be achieved through similar activities focused on thepsychosocial aspects of care, linking the daily work of HCWs to the benet for patients and families. The COMPASS program (Colleagues Meeting to Promote and Sustain Satisfaction) out of the Mayo Clinic has receivedattention as a promising intervention to boost meaning inwork and job satisfaction among physicians. 69The program involves groups of 6 to 10 physicians meeting during protected time in the workday while eating a provided meal.A group leader uses question prompts to drive discussion of topics that reflect common stressful physician experiences. Time was also built in for socialization and buildingrelationships. In a randomized design, the COMPASSprogram reported gains in empowerment and engagement, and reductions in depersonalization at 3 and 12 months after the study, compared with the control group. COM-PASS participants also reported increases in nding their work meaningful; however, there were no differences in stress, depression symptoms, or job satisfaction comparedwith the control group. Importantly, these structured effortsto increase meaning among groups of HCWs demonstrate promising rst steps into a world of deliberate organiza- tional well-being efforts that many leaders are afraid toenter, or of which they are completely unaware. Individual Interventions Hand in hand with organizational efforts to improve well- being is the availability of multiple options for HCWs to select individual interventions that appeal to their specic situation and needs. As we consider strategies thatindividuals can use to improve their resilience and ght burnout, we must recognize a few key themes that permeate this group of interventions. The rst essential element isdeliberately increasing positive emotions to counteract theflood of negative emotions that accompany burnout. The second group of strategies is built around mindfulness and other reflective activities that bolster self-care. Thirdly arestrategies that enhance individuals' sense of purpose and meaning in their work. Research demonstrates that indi- viduals will benet most from activities that they selectthemselves, that they enjoy, that they value, that are notdifcult, and that do not induce guilt. 116 Of concern for those with burnout is the tendency to focus on negative information and possible threats in theenvironment, at the expense of noticing positive informa-tion. In 1 study using eye tracking technology, researchers demonstrated that individuals experiencing higher levels of burnout spent less time focusing on uplifting images andmore time focusing on distressing images. 8In this same manner, burnout makes it difcult for individuals to notice positive events and interactions, thereby shaping theindividual's experience into a constant stream of negativeoccurrences, which only serves to perpetuate burnout. Not only is a focus on negative events associated with burnout, it is predictive of mortality. A large analysis of theTwitter feeds in the northeastern United States for negative tweets (reflections on things going poorly) found a high correlation with heart disease mortality. 117Conversely, tweeting about positive events was associated with lessmortality. In a separate study, researchers found that nuns who displayed highly positive emotion early in life lived on average a decade longer than their less cheerful peers. 118The theme here is that reflecting on the positive is associatedwith global well-being. Humans have a hard-wired ''negativity bias ''wherein negative stimuli captures and holds attention much more soFigure 3.

Arch Pathol Lab Med\u2014Vol 145, September 2021 The Science of Health Care Worker Burnout \u2014Rehder et al 1101than positive stimuli. Barbara Fredrickson, a leader in this eld, puts it succinctly: ''The negative screams at you, but the positive only whispers. ''119As mammals have evolved, the ability to recognize, remember, and quickly respond to things that pose a danger to us has developed as a survival mechanism.120During these moments of threats, the ''flight or ght ''response is triggered and we see a host of associated physiologic responses, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory rate, and increasedlevels of stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol. 121 Unfortunately, advanced cognition in humans leads us toperseverate on these negative events, leading to a prolonged elevated stress response and subsequent chronic conditions, such as hypertension. 122 Psychologic techniques are useful to combat burnout through retraining the individual to take notice of positive experiences.24,123This is achieved by cultivating 10 positive emotions: love, joy, amusement, hope, awe, serenity, inspiration, interest, pride, and gratitude. The goal of positive psychology in this setting is not to ignore negative experiences, but to reestablish a balance between positive and negative experiences to promote well-being.124After September 11, 2001, research showed that across the well- being spectrum people felt anxious, distressed, and angry,but it was those with high well-being who also felt challenged to make a change, able to notice the helpers rising to the occasion, and viewed the event as temporary rather than permanent. 125 Barbara Fredrickson and her colleagues13have also demonstrated the ''undoing effects of positive emotion, '' referring to the ability of positive psychology to assist in physiologic recovery from stressful events. Her research has shown that activities that bolster positive emotion result in a quicker return of vital signs to baseline after a stressor.13 The most studied tool for fostering positive emotion is ''Three Good Things. ''Based on research by Seligman etal,24this exercise asks participants to write down 3 good things that happened that day each evening. A randomized controlled trial of this tool found gains in happiness andreductions in depression symptoms at the end of the study and 6 months later. 24A recent study with HCWs demon- strated that 15 days of Three Good Things resulted in reduced emotional exhaustion and depression, and im- proved happiness at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months offollow-up, and improved work-life balance at 1- and 6- month follow-up (Figure 4). 6A separate study replicated these results and found emotional exhaustion, emotional thriving, emotional recovery, depression symptoms, happi- ness, and problems with work-life balance all improved byday 15. 7Gains in emotional exhaustion, emotional recovery, depression symptoms, and work-life balance endured at 6- and 12-month follow-up (Figure 5). Three Good Things participants evaluated the experience positively, with 95.8% reporting, ''I would recommend the Three Good Things exercise to a friend ''; 85.3% reporting, ''I have encouraged others to try Three Good Things ''; and 92.7% reporting, ''I would like to participate in Three Good Things again next year.'' Reflecting on what went well through Three Good Things has been a practical, bite-sized, and easy-to-share inter- vention using enrollment links (Sexton126) and brief videos (see Table 1 for all tool links and descriptions).127We have learned that HCWs high in emotional exhaustion are alsohigh in hopelessness. 128To this end, and using the same published methodology from the Three Good Things intervention, we developed other bite-sized interventions that we reference throughout the individual interventions section of this review. The rst of these is the LookingForward tool. 7It was designed to shift HCWs' focus deliberately toward what they anticipate will be positive experiences in the future. This shift of focus onto positive future events is enjoyable and facilitates hopeful anticipa- tion. Using simple prompts sent via email or text messageduring the course of a month (days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28), participants were asked to describe something they hoped to experience or were looking forward to, for example, 1, 3, 5, or 10 years into the future. Participants were also prompted to write about thoughts and feelings associatedwith what they are looking forward to. Results revealed signicant improvement in depression symptoms, opti- mism, emotional thriving, and emotional recovery between baseline and day 28 (Figure 6). Strengthening Social Connections. \u2014Social connections are another large predictor of well-being and have been associated with improved cardiovascular health and im- mune function and lower rates of anxiety and depres- sion. 129-133A meta-analysis of 148 studies demonstrates the lack of strong social relationships is as predictive of mortality as smoking more than 15 cigarettes per day, and more predictive of mortality than routine physical activity or body mass index.129Similarly, measures of loneliness in college students has been associated with poor immune response toimmunization. 134Also, as discussed above in organizational interventions, negative interactions with others appear to be a signicant contributor to HCW burnout.22In a recent study of 20 intensive care units, one-on-one discussions with colleagues and informal social interactions withcolleagues outside of works were the most common interventions associated with improved staff well-being. 112 This notion of ''other people matter ''135is memorialized inFigure 4. Well-being metrics at baseline, 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow- up for participants of Three Good Things. For demonstration purposes,all variables were scaled 0-100 in this graph. Burnout was alreadyscaled 0-100, depression scores (response range, 0-30) weremultiplied by 3.33, work-life balance (response range, 1-4) wassubtracted by 1 and multiplied by 33.33, and subjective happinessscores (response range, 1-7) were subtracted by 1 and multiplied by 16.66.

Gratitude and Giving. \u2014Giving to others and gratitude toward others blend both the benets of positive emotion along with social connections. Random acts of kindness toward coworkers increased happiness and reduced depres-sive symptoms in both givers and receivers, and promoted other kind behaviors in the workplace. 136The link to a bite- sized version of this intervention can be found in Table 1. In a recent randomized trial of HCWs, we found that a single, Web-based gratitude writing prompt resulted inincreased happiness, lower burnout, and improved work- life balance at 1-week follow-up (Figure 7).35This benet did not differ regardless of whether the letter prompt was self-focused or focused on others. We replicated these results in a separate sample and found benets across all 3 outcomes at 1-month after intervention.7We have adapted this exercise in different ways to foster well-being, including gratitude writing activities during staff meetings or a bulletin board in a common space allowing team members to express gratitude to their colleagues. We have even had patients and families join in, writing notes or recordingA Figure 5.

It is as simple and effective as it sounds, and it lends itself to modications for various applications. Self-Care. \u2014Before we briefly discuss self-care practices, such as yoga, exercise, sleep, and meditation, it is necessaryto provide a disclaimer about the evidence: it matterswhether your self-care practices are nely honed habits oran attempt to cultivate a new life skill during a crisis. Inother words, when you are drowning, it is not the right timeto try to learn how to swim\u2014you need a life preserver. Ifyou are an avid runner or a consistent meditator, or youhave been practicing yoga for many years, then leaning on those skills during a rough patch is an excellent idea. However, if you are not a yogi/zen/marathoner but areconfronting severe emotional exhaustion, lack of sleep,relationship difculties, and a compromised immunesystem, perhaps you should consider one of the bite-sizedexamples described earlier (Table 1) to put a little gas back into your tank. That said, there is evidence that exercise is good for burnout, 137,138as is yoga.139In our experience, however, they are 2 of the least heeded suggestions, andthey often result in eye rolls and snarky comments. They areeffective, but they are not very practical as a starting pointfor many people who are struggling. Similarly, sleep isfoundational to well-being, 140and getting less than 6 hours141a night is a risk factor for burnout, but like exercise, it is effective without being practical for many people in need of something simpler. For an excellent summary of fatigue management, sleep hygiene, and naps, we highlyrecommend Matthew Walker's book Why We Sleep . 142We have also created a bite-sized tool to cultivate sleep qualityand quantity, called the sleep tool. Mindfulness Meditation. \u2014There is an impressive amount of quality evidence around mindfulness meditation,Figure 6.

Forinstance, Krasner and colleagues 145lead an 8-week program on mindfulness, communication, and self-awareness forprimary care physicians. They found benets for mindful-ness, burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization,and personal accomplishment), empathy, and mood distur-bance across the course of the training and benets weresustained at the 15-month follow-up. Qualitative analysis revealed that physicians felt they beneted from the training because of the opportunities to (1) connect with colleaguesand reduce professional isolation, (2) improve mindfulnessskills to be attentive, listen deeply to patients, and respondmore effectively, and (3) develop greater self-awareness. 146 Although mindfulness programs for burnout show consid-erable promise, not all HCWs are interested in learningmeditation techniques. Moreover, the time commitment oftraining required (typically approximately 8 to 10 weeks, oraround 75 total hours) is often a limiting factor for busyHCWs. 146,147We have distilled many of these insights into our bite-sized well-being tools, including the cultivation of mindfulness, self-compassion, and serenity. Although the evidence on individual interventions for well-being is still in the early stages, the data tell a convincing story regarding the benets of cultivatingpositive emotions, self-care, and mindfulness. Figure 4provides a rough approximation to allow for comparisonacross some of these interventions. You can see that theThree Good Things intervention is similar to mindfulnessmeditation and coaching in terms of the relative impact onemotional exhaustion. Although the relative change across apopulation is similar for each intervention, the benet willundoubtedly vary for individuals. Said another way, thereare consistent benets to cultivating positive emotions, but which positive emotion will provide the greatest impact and be sustainable will be different for unique individuals. Forthis reason, we encourage leaders and HCWs to try one ofthese interventions that appeals to them, and to alsoconsider additional subsequent interventions. SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATHOLOGISTS AND CLINICAL LABORATORIES There is a paucity of data regarding well-being and burnout in pathologists and clinical laboratory workers.Despite this, the underlying contributors to well-being andto burnout in HCWs is largely consistent across specialties and disciplines, and therefore we can still make relatively decisive statements around drivers of well-being in thispopulation. Pathologists and laboratory medicine professionals may have a few unique characteristics that affect their ownresilience and their risk factors for burnout. Because they areoften 1 or 2 steps removed from direct patient care, their riskfor depersonalization is likely higher. Given their role indiagnosis, pathologists and laboratory medicine profession-als are also at high risk of second victim syndrome. Anybenet from a lower likelihood of working nights and weekends compared with some other specialties may benegated by high workload or long workdays. Also,laboratory medicine efforts often go unrecognized until there is a problem or issue, potentially setting up an imbalance between workload, resources, respect and value,and meaning in work. 148This imbalance has likely worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic with dramatically increaseddemand for testing development and turnaround. The available data tell us that as a discipline, pathologists have similar but slightly less than the mean physicianburnout rate of 44%, with 33% to 40% of pathologistsexperiencing at least 1 domain of burnout. 37,149Similarly, approximately 36% of pathology trainees report burnout,150 whereas as much as half of clinical laboratory professionals report burnout.151However, these data may not accurately depict COVID-19 pandemic prevalence. Satisfaction withwork-life balance among pathologists also decreasednotably from 2011 to 2017. 37Data for pathologists, pathology trainees, and clinical laboratory professionalsdemonstrate that workload and dealing with difcultcolleagues are primary stressors in their daily work. 149,150,152 Interventions focused on pathology or laboratory groups are rare to nonexistent in the literature.151,153Authors postulate that the largest well-being benets in pathologistsand clinical laboratory professionals will likely come fromfocusing on minimizing nonessential tasks, strengtheningmeaning in work, building autonomy and control, andfostering mentoring. 151,153-155Our own experience in the Duke University Clinical Laboratories has demonstratedwell-being benets from enhancing these aspects of cultureas well as personal well-being interventions. However, a better understanding of the contributors and supportive interventions of well-being in pathologists and clinicallaboratory professionals is sorely needed and should be afuture focus of research. DEBRIEFING HEALTH CARE LEADERS AND WORK SETTINGS If you are reading this article, you may be asked at some point to debrief a leader or an entire work setting on theirwell-being survey results. We nd that clinical outcomessuffer when less than 60% of staff report positive well-being(ie, more than 40% of staff report emotional exhaustion). 33 These work settings will see the largest benet from well-being interventions and are also likely to struggle adoptingother new initiatives until burnout is addressed. Similarly,when.80% of staff report well-being, efforts should be focused on maintaining that well-being, and devoting resources to other culture domains will often have greaterefcacy. High levels of burnout within a work setting will almost always be accompanied by strong emotions: frustration,doubt, anger, cynicism, apathy, and distrust. These emotionsare often a result of the working conditions that contributedto burnout, only to be further cultivated by the focus onnegative experiences inherent in burnout. Distrust in localand organizational leaders is common, and attention to mending that relationship will be important to make progress in group well-being. The most important task of the debrief is to listen. Common themes will likely present themselves as staffdiscuss their concerns and ''pain points. ''Participants may describe lack of voice, little control over decisions in their Arch Pathol Lab Med\u2014Vol 145, September 2021 The Science of Health Care Worker Burnout \u2014Rehder et al 1105work area, or an absence of autonomy. They will also likely highlight the high demands of their work, where they feeloverextended, and what resources they lack. Although it willbe natural to immediately suggest solutions, maintaininghumble inquiry during the debrief will be important for acomplete understanding of staff perspectives, and it will letthe staff feel that their voice has been heard. After thedebrief, synthesizing the feedback and communicating thesendings back to staff ensure their concerns were heardaccurately and completely. Then, passing these ndings onto local leaders allows those leaders to more directly applyresources and the most efcacious wellness interventions. Following a recent culture survey for the Duke University Health System, we identied work settings that scored inthe bottom decile for both well-being and teamworkdomains as ''high-touch units. ''A few selected health system leaders sat down for debriefs with respectivesampling focus groups of members for each of these worksettings, asking about things going well in their work area aswell as items of concern. After conrming accuracy offeedback with the debrief participants, that feedback waspassed onto local leadership along with suggested targetedinterventions consistent with the concepts discussed in thismanuscript. Despite there being no specic required actionsfor those leaders, the subsequent work culture survey (18months later) demonstrated remarkable improvements. Statistically signicant gains were noted in well-being scores for each of these work settings, as well as almostevery other safety culture domain. Relative to the rest of thehealth system, these work settings saw greater improve-ments in their safety culture and workforce well-being. All too often, local leaders feel helpless, not knowing how to address growing burnout and dissatisfaction among theirstaff. These feelings themselves make any organizationalinterventions more challenging to take hold and sustain,because the physiology of burnout directly depletes staffmembers' readiness for change. The success of thedebrieng events described above for work settings thatmay be particularly struggling is offered as a proof ofconcept for the well-being interventions and strategiesdiscussed in this manuscript. CONCLUSIONS Health care worker well-being arises from an intricate balance of many influences, yet its impact on patient andorganizational outcomes is undeniable. Health care workerburnout is a complex pathology that directly assaults theability of HCWs to provide optimal and compassionate carefor patients, to recover from stressful and emotionallyevents, and to innovate in their daily work. As health care leaders, it is imperative that we role-model well-being behaviors and demonstrate that HCW well-being is an organizational priority. No single interventionwill be effective in promoting and sustaining well-being in ahealth care organization. Thoughtful application of multipleinterventions can be expected to have an additive effect,particularly when addressing the different organizationaland individual factors driving well-being. Existing HCWburnout must be addressed while well-being strategies areintegrated into the culture of the organization to achievewell-being sustainability. In this review, we have highlighted a host of evidence- based well-being interventions, focusing on those interven-tions that require low resources and minimal initiationeffort. Our hope is that leaders will be able to use these resources and strategies to continue an organizationalcultural change that prioritizes HCW well-being. Caring for our workers is not only the right thing to do, it will lead to nancial and operational benets. References 1. Moss M, Good VS, Gozal D, Kleinpell R, Sessler CN.
