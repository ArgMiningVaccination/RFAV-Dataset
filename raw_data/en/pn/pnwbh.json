Attempts at developing a vaccine are decades old, beginning in 1976 with the first documented case of Ebola.[ [4](javascript:void(0);)] Although several strategies over the years have proven effective in laboratory and animal models, and one recent strategy has achieved success in nonhuman primates, no strategy to date has been able to move into clinical trials. This implies that a vaccine approved for widespread use in humans may be years away. Vaccine development is difficult and requires long-term efforts, explained Dr. Thomas G. Ksiazek, Acting Branch Chief of Special Pathogens Branch, CDC. One difficulty is knowing whom to vaccinate. Unless driven by a bioterrorist threat, said Dr. Ksiazek, it is difficult to know what the target populations are for these vaccines. Other difficulties include a lack of understanding of the natural history of these viruses. Many people now presume that these viruses are of zoonotic origin, says Dr. Ksiazek, but we still are not sure of the species or host reservoir. Further problems with vaccine development stem from the highly contagious nature of these viruses. Secondary transmission from person-to-person contact, or contact with contaminated devices, such as syringes and needles, incur high rates of illness and death. Vaccine research for these viruses therefore requires the use of biosafety level-4 facilities, which slows development because of the limited number of laboratories meeting this standard. Vaccine development for the filoviruses appears to be taking place in only a few labs in the United States. \"As far as I'm aware,\" says Dr. Mary Kate Hart, who leads one of the research labs at USAMRIID, \"the current efforts to develop vaccines are at USAMRIID, in Dr. Nabel's group [at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)], and in Dr. Alving's group at Walter Reed [Army Institute for Research (WRAIR)].\" Several different strategies from these institutions are currently under investigation, including DNA vaccination, DNA-prime with adenovirus boost, Venezuelan equine encephalitis ) ).[ [5](javascript:void(0);)] Most of these strategies have not moved beyond animal studies. Prevention has been achieved in rodents, particularly mice and guinea pigs, but remains difficult to achieve in nonhuman primates.[ [4](javascript:void(0);)] A new approach, however, has generated considerable attention for its success in preventing Ebola in primates. Reported in Nature by Dr. Nancy Sullivan and colleagues from the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), National Institutes of Health (NIH), this strategy uses a 2-step approach that begins with DNA immunization followed by a boost with adenoviral vectors encoding viral proteins that generate cellular and humoral immunity in cynomolgus macaques.[ [6](javascript:void(0);)] In their study published in 2000, monkeys were assigned to 1 of 2 groups, the control group or the vaccinated group, and then given a lethal dose of the most virulent strain of Ebola (Zaire subtype). Within a week, all the monkeys in the control group died, whereas all vaccinated monkeys had no symptoms, and they remained asymptomatic for more than 6 months. The advantage of this approach is that it allows for \"a much more vigorous response than occurs with either vaccine agent alone, at least in animal models,\" says Dr. Nabel, VRC, NIH, who leads the research on this strategy. \"The disadvantage is that you need to make 2 products and keep track of when each should be administered. This may be difficult in the developing world.\" So far, no clinical trials are scheduled.According to Dr. Nabel, \"we are in the process of satisfying regulatory requirements so that we can proceed to phase 1 studies in humans, hopefully within the next year.\" The importance of moving this research along was emphasized by Dr. Clarence J. Peters, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston. This 2-vaccine approach is promising and provides a \"foothold to improving\" vaccine development for Ebola, says Dr. Peters. But, he qualified, \"I think we should know how to create a practical vaccine against Ebola.\" Others also emphasize that this strategy needs further study before it can be applied to humans. Although the dose of 6 plaque-forming units (PFU) given in the study by Sullivan and colleagues was enough to kill the unprotected monkeys, researchers point out that human exposure to Ebola through a needlestick and infected blood would likely involve a dose of at least 1000 PFU.[ [4](javascript:void(0);)] Past studies show that protection achieved against low doses of the virus may not be effective against higher doses.[ [7](javascript:void(0);)] The need to test against a more robust challenge of Ebola in nonprimates is suggested by a recently published study from USAMRIID. Several potential vaccine candidates were tested to determine their effectiveness in nonhuman primates injected with 1000 PFU of Ebola. None of the vaccine candidates, which successfully prevented infection in rodent studies, achieved protection in nonhuman primates. The authors concluded that protecting nonhuman primates may require protective mechanisms that are different from those required to protect rodents.[ [4](javascript:void(0);)] Another strategy that is making some headway into clinical trials is alphavirus replicon technology. This strategy has shown \"promise in rodent testing for Ebola and Marburg, as well as nonhuman primate testing for Marburg,\" according to Dr. Mary Kate Hart, USAMRIID. [AlphaVax, Inc.](https://www.alphavax.com/) is currently moving forward with the replicon strategy. According to Dr. Peter Jahrling, USAMRIID, AlphaVax has an HIV vaccine in a VEEV replicon in phase 2 clinical testing, with an investigational new drug (IND) status. A relatively new strategy for managing these viruses is the development of antivirals. A clear advantage of this approach is the ability to use \"such a drug for an emerging outbreak, natural or deliberate, and [using it] to contain spread in an unvaccinated population,\" explained Dr. Nabel. A current strategy at NIAID is to develop antiviral drugs for negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that are similar to Ebola, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), according to Dr. Peters. Experimental studies of antivirals developed to treat RSV by Dr. John Huggins and colleagues in the Department of Viral Therapeutics, USAMRIID, showed efficacy in models of Ebola, but because of the drug's high toxicity the research was abandoned, said Dr. Peters. So far, says Dr. Nabel, \"it hasn't been possible yet to develop antiviral drugs for Ebola,\" but it is \"clearly desirable.\" One big advantage of this approach, and its underlying premise, is that if an antiviral drug effective against Ebola \"could work against other viruses, it would be more desirable since there would be more interest from the pharmaceutical companies to market and manufacture it,\" explained Dr. Nabel. Dr. Peters agrees, and although he views the current status of this approach as \"torpid in its execution,\" he also thinks \"it has a lot to recommend itself and [thinks] it should be actively pursued.\" Since Ebola has occurred relatively rarely and affects far fewer people than other, more epidemic diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria, it is natural that some people in the scientific community are resistant to devoting so many dollars to the filoviruses. Do these viruses really pose a public health threat severe enough to warrant the attention given them? Posing this question to Dr. Peters created a mixed reaction. On one hand, an \"Ebolic mystique\" has been established by books such as The Hot Zone and Outbreak, says Dr. Peters. This mystique, according to Peters, is overblown; the filoviruses really pose a small public health threat. Indeed, outbreaks of these viruses have been sporadic throughout the past several decades, resulting in relatively small numbers of infected people. In the most recent outbreak of Ebola virus in Gabon, 65 people have been reported to have contracted the disease as of April 4, 2002.[ [8](javascript:void(0);)] Past outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg, which number only 14 episodes since the first outbreak of Marburg in 1967, similarly show relatively few infections compared with other viral diseases.[ [9](javascript:void(0);)] On the other hand, despite the relatively few outbreaks and small numbers of people infected by these viruses in comparison to wider public health threats, everyone agrees that these viruses are dangerous. Without a way to prevent or treat infected persons, mortality rates are very high. Of the 65 people reported infected in the most recent Gabon outbreak, 53 have died. Past outbreaks have reported similarly high mortality rates, up to 90%.[ [4](javascript:void(0);)] For years, says Dr. Peters, \"we saw different filoviruses and arenaviruses arise in a specific location, and every time one came along [we] thought 'we just dodged a bullet on that.' People would say that these viruses are far away, but really, they are not far away.\" \"Ebola represents the unknown,\" he continues. We don't know very much about them, whether they could adapt to humans, if they are trans-species, or what their reservoir is. One of the main issues regarding filoviruses is the need to better understand their natural history, he states. The other main issue from a bioterrorism perspective is the need to develop effective vaccines or antivirals that can be used in case of an attack.
