Evidence-based, naturally.\"Every person has a passion or calling to do something in this world. Mine is to be a naturopathic physician. \"Since you are reading this brochure during the pandemic, you probably wonder what has changed at SCNM. In some ways, everything. In other ways, nothing. Everything Two weeks after the pandemic struck in March 2020, SCNM students and faculty made the abrupt transition to online learning and teaching. The two years SCNM spent building an online learning platform to offer a Master of Science in Clinical Nutrition degree paved a smooth path forward for the Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine program. Students adapted to the virtual environment. Faculty worked countless hours to migrate their courses - 74 just for the Fall Quarter - from Zoom to the more robust Canvas learning management system. SCNM's Academic Department created an online instruction course so faculty could incorporate best practices in online instruction into their courses. The Department of Information Technology refreshed the entire IT infrastructure with new servers, routers and double the bandwidth. Student Affairs engaged the student body with weekly Class President Town Halls to identify and address issues related to remote learning. Patient care and clinical training relied primarily on telemedicine, while preserving optional student in-person clinic rotations. Nothing SCNM's Core Values didn't change. We achieve excellence; We are resilient; We shape the future; We do the right thing; and, We love - these values guided our decisions and reinforced our convictions. Classes, clinical rotations, and many laboratory sections continued uninterrupted. At the first wave's height, the Arizona Department of Health Services tapped SCNM physicians and students to hold on-campus COVID-19 testing. The Ric Scalzo Institute for Botanical Research conducted a groundbreaking study on the anti-SARS-CoV2 activity of 30 medicinal plants. Arizona State University and SCNM collaborated on a clinical trial on Vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients. When social unrest erupted following the killings of unarmed black men and women, SCNM partnered with ASU's Center for the Study of Race and Democracy to begin the hard work of ensuring a more diverse, inclusive and equitable experience for all members of our community. Despite the sense of existential threat to the College, especially in the pandemic's early days, we made the commitment to not furlough or lay off employees, and to not pass on the safety and technology costs to students by keeping tuition flat. Read on if you share these Core Values, the Vision of a World that embraces the healing power of nature, and a dedication to becoming a naturopathic physician. The SCNM Experience awaits you.President's Message Paul Mittman, ND, EdD President & CEO 2 - - 3 Pursue Your Passion A Message from Dr. Mittman - 3 Research Student-led research focuses on botanicals bridging the gap between naturopathic and conventional medicine.

Frontiers in Pharmacology. Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in December 2019, millions of people have been infected and died worldwide. However, no drug has been approved for the treatment of this disease and its complications, which urges the need for finding novel therapeutic agents to combat. Among the complications due to COVID-19, lung injury has attained special attention. Besides, phytochemicals have shown prominent anti-inflammatory effects and thus possess significant effects in reducing lung injury caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Also, the prevailing evidence reveales the antiviral effects of those phytochemicals, including anti-SARS-CoV activity, which could pave the road in providing suitable lead compounds in the treatment of COVID-19. In the present study, candidate phytochemicals and related mechanisms of action have been shown in the treatment/protection of lung injuries induced by various methods. In terms of pharmacological mechanism, phytochemicals have shown potential inhibitory effects on inflammatory and oxidative pathways/mediators, involved in the pathogenesis of lung injury during COVID-19 infection. Also, a brief overview of phytochemicals with anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds has been presented. Characterization of the activity of the Pitcher plant against human papilloma virus and associated cancers. Our research has demonstrated that the botanical, Sarracenia purpurea (Pitcher plant), has antiviral activity against human papilloma viruses. An ongoing project is to decipher the mechanism and target of this herb toward the replication cycle of these viruses. Current results suggest that S. purpurea inhibits viral transcription resulting in a lack of mRNA synthesis. Notably, the precise target of action appears to be a cellular cyclin-dependent kinase required by the virus during the replication process. Based on this research, we have created a botanical formulation based which has been effective in the treatment of various HPV-associated cancers including actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma, as well as common warts.Identification of botanicals with potential therapeutic use against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen. Over and improper use of pharmaceuticals against S. aureus has led to the development of antibiotic resistance, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Our research has examined the efficacy of botanical extracts as an alternative form of treatment to S. aureus and MRSA, including penicillin/methicillin resistant S. aureus (PenR), and multi-drug resistant S. aureus (MDR). Initial screening of botanicals was done via a minimum inhibitory concentration procedure. In addition, a temporal growth curve was performed in order to quantify the growth of the bacteria in the presence of the extracts. Results demonstrated 13 botanicals that had varying activities against S. aureus, PenR, and MDR. These results propose botanical-derived antimicrobial extracts that may be utilized against S. aureus and different antibiotic resistant strains of MRSA. Non-enzymatic anti-bacterial activity of honey based on floral origin. Honey has been revered for its' medicinal properties for thousands of years, with ancient medical texts claiming a wide range of clinical applications. Modern research has demonstrated a range of effects including anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, and antioxidant action, as well as anti-microbial and wound-healing properties. This has led to the proliferation of honey-based medical products and clinical applications in cases of infected wounds, burns, and diabetic ulcers with highly successful results. Our research evaluated the non-enzymatic anti-bacterial activity of honey from a variety of floral origins, mostly within North America. These results demonstrate a varying range of anti-bacterial action from several honey types based on floral origin against a variety of pathogenic bacteria, independent of pH, osmosis, and enzyme activity.Recent Publications - Jeffrey Langland, PhD Professor of Research Chair, Department of Research\"The Ric Scalzo Institute for Botanical Research will advance 21st century botanical medicine through innovative scientific exploration grounded in clinical herbalism's rich tradition. Unlike any other naturopathic institution, the Research Institute's analytical and bioassay laboratories will elucidate the mechanism of action of botanicals, optimize botanical extraction methodology, identify active constituents, and add quality control for botanical therapies. By deciphering the specific mechanism of action of herbs, novel botanical blends will be designed and traditional formulas optimized to target different aspects of diseases. Our research team, which includes SCNM students, will broaden our understanding and discovery of new botanical therapies for a multitude of global health concerns, as well as provide students with opportunities to sharpen their critical thinking skills, offering unique insights in the realm of botanical therapies and exposure to career opportunities.\" Ric Scalzo Institute for Botanical Research Thanks to a generous donation, SCNM will open the new Ric Scalzo Institute for Botanical Research BSL-2 laboratory in 2021. The Institute's mission is to understand how traditional plant medicines operate on a cellular level in order to create novel botanical solutions that support people, planet, and plants. For the past 18 years, the SCNM Research Department has explored the molecular biology of medicinal plants. This work includes a 5-year study on Echinacea species that elucidated its immunological and anti-inflammatory effects and discovered the responsible constituents. In recent years the Department, headed by Dr. Jeffrey Langland and supported by SCNM students, has conducted, presented, and published research on the anti-viral properties of carnivorous and non-carnivorous plants, immune cell and cytokine regulation by Astragalus and Echinacea species, compared and contrasted the anti-bacterial activity of honey varieties, essential oils, and colloidal silver, and identified and evaluated anti-bacterial and anti-fungal herbs, including those against antibiotic resistant micro-organisms. The Department is developing a tissue-culture model to study the epigenetic effects of botanicals to evaluate and compare the cellular responses to a variety of Cannabis sativa L. industrial hemp cultivars and botanicals involved in improved skin care and health. Most recently, Dr. Langland shifted his focus to the global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Utilizing information from previous research on antiviral botanicals, traditional Chinese medicine, and personal communication with herbalists and Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners, physicians and scientists, Dr. Langland and his team selected an array of 30 medicinal plants and developed an activity screening using Viral inhibition assays coupled with cell toxicity testing create a profile of potentially effective botanicals. They are now investigating the mechanism of action related to the viral replication cycle to further determine optimal botanical formualtions. The Institute will build upon the molecular biology research with the addition of analytical and isolation laboratories. These laboratories combined with the clinical expertise and knowledge of herbalists, scientists, traditional practitioners, and naturopathic physicians, will transform the understanding of botanicals. Institute research faculty and naturopathic medical students will have a world-class facility to collaborate on ground-breaking discoveries using medicinal plants.
