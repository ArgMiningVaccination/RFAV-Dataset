Using functional medicine, we address imbalances in these core areas that cause disease and block the body from its intuitive power. When these imbalances are addressed, the body's ability to heal is accelerated. Patients often see improvements in unexpected areas of life as their whole selves begin to heal. You no longer have to settle for a 10-minute doctor visit filled with endless prescriptions, lingering symptoms, and a growing sense that you'll never feel well again. At Nourish Medical Center, we take a personalized approach, creating a health plan that is as unique as you are. We listen deeply to your unique story and collaborate with you to create solutions that reflect your needs and lifestyle. We know the temptation to go at it alone. Health information online can be confusing and ineffective, leaving you without any REAL results. It is easy to get discouraged. Let the doctors at Nourish support you with our years of experience using evidence-based natural medicine and restorative treatments. We provide resources and education that help you feel more confident when making health decisions. At Nourish Medical Center, our compassionate health professionals provide care for the whole family and treat a full range of conditions including: fatigue, anxiety, thyroid disease, hormone imbalance, digestive health, mental health, autoimmunity, weight management, allergies, environmental toxicity, heart disease, blood sugar, and pain management. Acting as health detectives, we use lab work, functional testing, and detailed health histories to discover the root cause of illness. Treatments can include addressing imbalances with diet, supplements, herbs, nutrient IVs, vitamin shots, even bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. Energetic therapies can include homeopathy, mind body medicine, and health and life coaching. Our doctors also know when pharmaceuticals are needed and how to use them responsibly in treatment. You can expect to spend at least an hour with your doctor on your first visit, discussing current symptoms, medical history, performing a physical exams, and creating a plan for functional testing if needed. This information helps give your doctor a solid picture of your current state of health and helps them create a personalized health plan. Follow-up visits can last between 15 - 45 minutes depending on the complexity of the appointment. We are committed to spending this time with you, helping unlock your greatest healing potential. We see health as a partnership and we invest in your healing journey as if it was our own. Our goal is to help you achieve results that can change your life. "}
