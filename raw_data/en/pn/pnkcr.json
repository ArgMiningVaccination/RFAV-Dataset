Dietary supplements include such ingredients as vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and enzymes, and are typically marketed in forms such as tablets, capsules, softgels, gelcaps, powders, and liquids. Dietary supplements may also include other ingredients, such as fillers, binders, excipients, preservatives, sweeteners, and flavorings. These \"other ingredients\" are listed separately from dietary ingredients on the Supplement Facts label. For information about publicly displayed new dietary ingredient notifications (NDINs) that we have reviewed to date, visit [Submitted 75-Day Premarket Notifications for New Dietary Ingredients](/food/new-dietary-ingredient-ndi-notification-process/submitted-75-day-premarket-notifications-new-dietary-ingredients). The manufacturer, packer, or distributor whose name appears on the label of a dietary supplement (the \"responsible firm\") is required to record and report to FDA any reports it receives of serious adverse events associated with the use of its products. In addition, the responsible firm must keep records of any non-serious adverse event reports it receives. Members of the dietary supplement industry may use the reporting form on the [Safety Reporting Portal](http://www.safetyreporting.hhs.gov/) to meet the reporting requirements in section 761 of the FD&C Act. Consumers who have experienced a health-related reaction or illness (also known as an adverse event) after consuming any dietary supplement should contact their medical professional. It is important for consumers, health care professionals, and industry members to report adverse events to FDA, so we can act to protect the public from unsafe products. You can report adverse events to FDA by visiting the [How to Report a Problem](/food/dietary-supplements/how-report-problem-dietary-supplements) page. FDA encourages consumers with questions about dietary supplements to [Submit An Inquiry](https://cfsan.secure.force.com/Inquirypage), or to visit [www.fda.gov/fcic](/food/resources-you-food/industry-and-consumer-assistance-cfsan) for additional information. Ingredient Directory To help manufacturers, retailers, and consumers of dietary supplements stay informed about recent developments and locate information on FDA's website quickly, we have put together an \"ingredient directory\" with links to FDA's actions and communications with regard to particular dietary ingredients and other ingredients used in products marketed as dietary supplements. We will update the directory periodically to reflect new developments. The directory is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all ingredients used in products marketed as dietary supplements and may not include all actions the agency has taken with respect to a particular ingredient. We welcome additional feedback and information regarding these ingredients. You may submit such information to the [FDA's Office of Dietary Supplement Programs](mailto:ODSP@fda.hhs.gov). |Ingredients||Other Known Names [ | Statements - 1,4 dimethylpentylamine 1,4-dimethylpentylamine [Hi Tech Acetamide, Paracetamol - Tylenol [Procter and Gamble - NatuALA [Neo Pharmaceuticals NDIN 840 Response Letter](https://www.regulations.gov/document/FDA-2014-S-0023-0069) (August 2014) [Star Scientific, Inc.
