{"title": "Fang Ji", "author": null, "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": null, "sitename": null, "date": "2022-09-28", "cleaned_text": "Fang Ji Stephania tetrandra (Fang Ji) is a medicinal herb from [Traditional Chinese Medicine](/other/traditional-chinese-medicine/) that is sometimes used alongside [Astragalus membranaceus](/supplements/astragalus/) for kidney protection and diabetes prevention; it is moderately antiinflammatory. 1. Sources and Composition 1.1 Sources Stephania tetrandra (of the family Menispermaceae) is a [traditional chinese medicine](/other/traditional-chinese-medicine/) that is also used in Japanese traditional medicine (Kampo), bearing the name hangfangji in Chinese medicine. [[1]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-1) It is traditionally used against autoimmune diseases and rheumatism, [[2]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-2) as well as antipyretic, diuretic, [[3]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-3) For medicinal usage, stephania tetrandra is sometimes referred to as 'Fangchi' or 'Fangji'; a term that also applies to [[4]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-4)0.78%, 1.28-2.84% [[3]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-3) contaminants fangchi) parts) [[13]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-13) - -sitosterol (aerial parts) [[13]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-13) Although it is subject to variance, some reports suggest that the total alkaloid content of the dry root of stephania tetrandra is approximately 2.3% of which tetrandrine 1% and 0.5% (total weight), respectively. [[9]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-9) [[14]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-14) The main bioactives appears to be the two bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, fangchinoline and tetrandrine 1.3 Formulations The formulation known as Boi-ogi-to (Fang-ji-huang-qi-tang) is a Kampo medicine containing this [[15]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-15) This formulation appears to be recommended for the treatment of arthritis and edema, and may have indirect effects on glucose and lipid metabolism associated with obesity. [[15]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-15) 2. Pharmacology 2.1 Enzymatic Interactions Tetrandrine appears to inhibit P-glycoprotein efflux transporter, [[16]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-16) with inhibition detectable at 1-2\u00b5M in vitro and an oral intake of 10-20mg/kg tetrandrine being able to increase the bioavailability of by P-glycoprotein); underlies some potential roles of tetandrine by overcoming drug resistance. [[18]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-18) [[19]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-19) Appears to be a relatively potent and biologically relevant P-glycoprotein inhibitor Moderate inhibitory potential on CYP3A4 activity an IC50 of 3.9\u00b5M in vitro. [[17]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-17) Tetrandrine has been noted to have no significant inhibitory activity on CYP1A2 (IC50 is somewhere [[17]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-17) The inhibition of CYP3A4 has not been confirmed in vivo, but it seems potent enough to be of concern 3. Molecular Targets 3.1 Ion Channels Tetrandrine appears to be a nonselective calcium channel blocker which influences L-type, N-type, and T-type channels; similar in structure and effects as other calcium site. [[22]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-22) [[23]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-23) [[24]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-24) Some sources have also suggested that tetrandrine can inhibit calcium efflux from intracellular stores (calcium channel antagonists tend to inhibit efflux from extracellular compartments to intracellular). [[21]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-21) [[25]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-25) 3.2 Adrenergic Receptors Tetrandrine appears to directly interact with 1-adrenergic receptors via competing with prazosin and phenylephrine binding [[20]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-20) with a Ki value of 690+/-120nM yet IC50 values of 252.8\u00b5M (in inhibiting adrenaline induced calcium influx), 11.6\u00b5M (inhibiting spontaous basal contractions), and 7.4\u00b5M (refilling of calcium stores sensitive to noradrenaline). [[26]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-26) Tetrandrine appears to be able to displace ligands of the 1-adrenergic receptors at the prazosin binding site, and moderately to weakly inhibits calcium influx via this receptor 4. Neurology 4.1 Glutaminergic Neurotransmission A water extract of stephania tetrandra was able to inhibit NMDA induced currents by 38.65+/-7.50%, which was less effective than both [scutellaria baicalensis](/supplements/baikal-skullcap/) (83.45+/-4.34%) and salvia miltiorrhiza (52.97+/-1.78%); as these plants had a [magnesium](/supplements/magnesium/) content and the study was conducted in vitro, this may not apply to oral ingestion of this herb. [[27]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-27) Requires more research to confirm if there are any actual interactions with glutaminergic neurotransmission 4.2 Neuroinflammation 25-50\u00b5M at 50\u00b5M (assessed by superoxide and nitric oxide formation) and appeared to be traced back to NF-kB inhibition. [[28]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-28) 4.3 Neurprotection In response to strokes, cells around the infarct area tend to undergo endoplasmic reticulum stress resulting in their apoptosis (cell death). [[29]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-29) [[30]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-30) An infusion of 30mg/kg tetrandrine (immediately and 2 hours after ischemia) appears to slightly attenuate cognitive impairment from stroke alongside reducing infarct size and brain edema. [[1]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-1) While the mechanism was not ascertained, it appeared that the ischemia-induced changes of three proteins (GRP78, DJ-1 and HYOU1) was significantly attenuated, which the authors thought reflected less endoplasmic reticulum stress. [[1]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-1) 5. Cardiovascular Health 5.1 Cardiac Tissue Tetrandrine's main mechanism of action, blocking calcium channels nonspecifically, appears to extend to cardiac tissue where it exerts antiarrythmic effects [[14]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-14) and has shown anti-arrythmic effects in response to cesium in rabbits [[31]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-31) as well as ischemia/reperfusion. [[32]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-32) [[33]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-33) Tetrandrine appears to reversibly block sodium (Na+) in the myocardium in the 60-120M range by 28.1-87.5% and an IC50 of 74.4-76.9M. [[34]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-34) May possess anti-arrythmic properties on heart tissue via inhibiting ion channels 6. Interactions with Glucose Metabolism 6.1 Mechanisms When incubated with HepG2 cells, tetrandrine fails to increase glucose consumption in vitro and failed to interact with both the insulin receptor (expression) and AMPK. [[17]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-17) 6.2 Blood Glucose In Streptozotocin induced diabetic mice, the water extract of stephania tetrandra appears to reduce blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner in the range of 0.48\u201416mg/kg, which is due to fangchinoline as tetrandrine was ineffective. [[15]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-15) The reduction in blood glucose reached 52.7+/-6.7% with 3mg/kg fangchinoline and was attributed to increased insulin release [[15]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-15) and this increase in insulin secretion is augmented with calycosin and formononectin form [astragalus membranaceus](/supplements/astragalus/) (wherein the combination of 300\u00b5g/kg fangchinoline, normally too low a dose, paired with either 30-100\u00b5g/kg calycosin or formononectin becomes effective despite the latter two flavonoids not being effective on their own). [[35]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-35) Fangchinoline appears to be an effective insulin secretagogue (causes insulin release) in diabetic rats at very low oral doses, and this is synergistic with flavonoids from astragalus membranaceus (a traditional pairing for glucose control) 6.3 Diabetes Tetrandrine at an oral dose of 20mg/kg daily in rats who normally spontaneously develop diabetes (BB rats) was able to reduce the cumulative occurrence from 75.5 to 10.9% associated with less pancreatic inflammation [[36]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-36) and FK506 (an immunosuppressive agent that also appears to reduce spontaneous diabetes risk in this same rat model [[37]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-37)) given for five days alongside tetrandrine appears to be synergistic as delayed administration of tetrandrine reduced diabetes occurrence from 73.1 to 41.7%, whereas the combination with FK506 reduced it to 3.6%. [[38]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-38) 7. Skeleton and Bone Metabolism 7.1 Osteoclasts In osteoclasts, a signalling molecule produced by osteoblasts called 'receptor activator of NF-kB ligand' (RANKL) binds to receptor (RANK) which then mediates proliferation of osteoclasts [[39]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-39) via downstream proteins such as MAPKs (ERK and [[40]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-40) AP-1, [[41]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-41) as well as NF-kB itself. [[42]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-42) An important mediator may be nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1), which can induce the effects associated with RANKL independent of RANKL itself [[43]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-43) (suggesting that RANKL works via NFATc1). Tetrandrine at 300-1,000nM is able to inhibit the RANKL-induced activation of NFATc1; specifically, while there was minimal suppressive effect initially the autoamplification of NFATc1 was halved. [[44]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-44) Although the exact mechanisms are not known, tetrandrine appears to dysregulate the ability of NFATc1 to autoamplify, which ultimately causes less osteoclastogenesis over the long run In sciatic-neurectomized mice, injections of 600-2,000\u00b5g/kg tetrandrine every other day for four weeks prevented the losses in bone mineral density and trabecular volume, insofar that trabecular bone density in the 600\u00b5g/kg group (despite neurectomy) was increased relative to non-neurectomized control. [[44]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-44) Injections of very low dose tetrandrine appear to be highly protective of bone mass, insofar to abolish losses in mice subject to neurectomy 8. Inflammation and Immunology 8.1 Macrophages Tetrandrine appears to cause macrophage toxicity in vitro (J774 macrophages) with an IC50 value of 50\u00b5M, somewhat higher than other mechanisms. [[45]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-45) 8.2 Neutrophils Tetrandrine is able to inhibit Mac-1 upregulation 0.1-10M, [[46]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-46) Mac-1 which adhesion [[47]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-47) ions; [[49]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-49) tetrandrine suppreses Mac-1 activation to reducing calcium influx [[46]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-46) although its known antioxidant property [[50]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-50) also seems to contribute somewhat. The overall anti-adhesive effect is concentration dependent, and can reduce fMLP and PMA induced adhesion to around 60% of baseline at 10\u00b5M. [[46]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-46) At quite low concentrations, tetrandrine is able to prevent neutrophil adhesion via suppressing both calcium influx and oxidation products within neutrophils 8.3 T Cells Tetrandrine appears to downregulate PKC dependent signalling in T lymphocytes, and shows suppressive effects on both acute phase T cell activation (calcium influx and IL-2 secretion) at 2-5\u00b5M as well as late phase stimulation (CD71 antigen production). [[2]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-2) This was thought to be independent of calcium signalling since CD40 was unaffected (and CD40 interacts with calcium but not PKC). [[2]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-2) 8.4 Rheumatism Traditionally, stephania tetrandra appears to be used against autoimmune diseases such as rheumatism and lupus. [[3]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-3) 12 weeks supplementation of a water extract of stephania ternatea thrice daily (10g total daily) to persons with diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis was able to reduce human granulocyte elastase (pathogenic factor in some autoimmune diseases [[51]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-51)) in serum by 56%; [[52]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-52) actual symptoms of rheumatism were not measured. 8.5 Virology Fangchinoline appears to inhibit HIV1 replication against multiple strains (NL4-3, LAI, BaL, PM1; inactive in TZM-b1) with an IC50 in the range of 0.8-1.7\u00b5M. [[53]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-53) It appears to target late stages of the infection cycle, and appears to interfere with gp160 proteolytic processing, [[53]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-53) gp160 being the inactive polypeptide precursor for the envelope proteins that allow HIV replication. [[54]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-54) [[55]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-55) At least in vitro, fangchinoline appears to be relatively potent in suppressing HIV1 replication 8.6 Bacteria Tetrandrine appears to have antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 250g/mL, with an MIC of 125g/mL against the strains 3102 and 3091 specifically [[56]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-56) and a similar potency against methicillin resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). [[57]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-57) It appears that tetrandrine can bind directly to [[56]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-56) and 125-250g/mL MIC to 31.2-125g/mL (2 to reduction). [[57]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-57) Elsewhere against strains of candida albicans, tetrandrine to be synergistically anti-bacterial when used alongside ketoconazole. [[58]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-58) Appears to have some anti-bacterial properties itself (although not overly potent), yet is somewhat synergistic with other pharmacological anti-bacterial agents 9. Interactions with Oxidation 9.1 In vitro Tetrandrine appears to be capable of scavenging superoxide radicals in vitro in a concentration dependent manner up to 30\u00b5M. [[50]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-50) 10. Interactions with Organs 10.1 Kidneys In isolated rat primary mesangial cells (kidney cells) stimulated with IL-1 (to induce glomerulonephritis in vitro [[59]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-59)) isolated tetrandrine was able to inhibit the activation of ERK/NF-kB as well as subsequent secretion of MMP9, [[60]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-60) which are known to correlate with and encourage renal pathology. [[61]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-61) Tetrandrine was active in the concentration range of 2-10g/mL, and was more effective (near complete suppression) in regards to iNOS, ERK, and IKK activity but less potent in suppressing IkB. [[60]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-60) Appears to reduce the effects of inflammation upon isolated kidney cells, which appears to occur at a low enough concentration that it may apply to oral supplementation of this herb 10.2 Liver In rats subject to bile duct ligation, tetrandrine (1-5mg/kg) appears to show anti-fibrotic effects associated with less gene expression (TGF-, -SMA, collagen 12 and angiogenesis gene products) which to its NF-kB inhibition. [[62]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-62) Stephania tetradra (200mg/kg water extract) potential as assessed by histology (fibrotic area) and stellate cell activation, again attributed to NF-kB inhibition. [[63]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-63) When compared to other agents, 5mg/kg tetrandrine is equally effective at reducing collagen accumulation as 50mg/kg silymarins (from [milk thistle](/supplements/milk-thistle/)) [[62]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-62) and 200mg/kg of the water extract of stephania tetrandra five times weekly for five weeks was as effective as 300mg/kg Salvia miltiorrhiza (water extract) in reducing liver enzymes but more effective in reducing fibrosis from CCl4; [[63]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-63) pairing stephania Stephania tetrandra appears to have anti-fibrotic potential that has a comparable or greater potency than other anti-fibrotic supplements 10.3 Penis In the isolated rabbit corpus cavernosum, tetrandine appears to concentration-dependently (between 100nM and 100\u00b5M) increase cAMP concentrations and was able to augment PGE1-induced cAMP accumulation. [[64]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-64) The authors thought this may reflect PDE enzyme inhibition, but this was not confirmed. [[64]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-64) Previously, tetrandrine has been noted to inhibit calcium influx into penile tissue [[65]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-65) and this is known to occur with increases in cAMP concentrations. [[66]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-66) Tetrandrine failed to have any influence on cGMP concentrations in the rabbit corpus cavernosum inherently and failed to augment SNP-induced increases in cGMP. [[64]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-64) Possibly related to the aforementioned increase in cAMP, tetrandine is known to cause relaxation in precontracted corpus cavernosum penile tissue. [[67]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-67) [[68]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-68) May have pro-erectile properties associated with increasing cAMP concentrations, and while the concentration that maximal effects occur is likely too high there may be some benefits (since the lowest active concentration is feasible); no studies using oral ingestion currently exist 11. Nutrient-Nutrient Interactions 11.1 Astragalus Membranaceus [Astragalus membranaceus](/supplements/astragalus/) appears to be with stephania reducing blood glucose, as inactive levels of astagalus (3-100mg/kg) and isolated fangchinoline (0.3mg/kg) appear to be active when ingested together in diabetic mice, insofar that 0.3mg/kg fangchinoline in the presence of 30mg/kg astragalus was as effective as 1mg/kg fangchinoline. [[15]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-15) This appears to be due to the flavonoids known as formononetin and calycosin from astragalus, as with stephania tetrandra in regards to reducing blood glucose, thought to be secondary to promoting insulin secretion from the pancreas. The oral doses the isolated bioactives are effective is remarkably low, showing a good deal of promise 11.2 Berberine [Berberine](/supplements/berberine/) is an anti-diabetic alkaloid that works via activating the protein known as AMPK. [[69]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-69) It is effluxed from the body into the intestines via P-glycoprotein transporters (reducing bioavailability), and the inhibition of P-glycoprotein by tetrandrine increases [[70]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-70) [[17]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-17) Berberine appears to have intestinal efflux (Caco-2) pretty much abolished in vitro with 1\u00b5M tetrandrine whereas it was only slightly hindered in liver (HL-7702) cells and not influence in muscle (C2C12) cells which do not express P-glycoprotein. [[70]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-70) Furthermore, it appears that the upregulation of P-glycoprotein that berberine exhibits Tetrandrine inhibits the transporter that effluxes berberine into the intestines, and by inhibiting this transporter it increases berberine absorption. Tetrandrine may also prevent berberine from upregulating (creatine more) of these transporters When looking at pharmacokinetic data, 10-20mg/kg tetrandrine alongside 100mg/kg berberine in rats was able to increase the Cmax of berberine in plasma in a dose-dependent manner by 36-62% (reaching 15.4ng/mL and 18.3ng/mL, from 11.3ng/mL in control) and the overall AUC increased to a similar 33-61%. [[17]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-17) Three weeks of treatment noted that the decreases of blood glucose seen in diabetic rats with 100mg/kg berberine (20.6%) was significantly increased with coingestion of 10mg/kg tetrandrine (55.2%) which even exceeded of berberine at 200mg/kg (39.5%). [[17]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-17) Tetrandrine is able to increase the glucose lowering and anti-diabetic properties of berberine, insofar that adding 1/10th the dose of tetrandrine to berberine is more effective than doubling the berberine dose 12. Safety and Toxicology 12.1 Case Studies There are a series of case studies (end stage renal disease) of which causation was placed upon a weight loss supplement said to include stephania tetrandra which was instead cut with another plant bearing the name of Fang Chi, Aristolochia fangchi (or Birthwort); [[73]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-73) this latter plant contains high levels of the nephrotoxin aristolochic acid. [[74]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-74) [[75]](/supplements/fang-ji/research/#ref-75) The plant Aristolochia fangchi is one of the four plants, alongside Stephania tetrandra, that is referred to as 'Fang Chi'. It also appears to have a relatively potent kidney toxin in it, and thus supplements that contain aristolochia fangchi rather than stephania tetrandra may cause significant kidney damage [^](#ref-link-1)Ruan L, Huang HS, Jin WX, Chen HM, Li XJ, Gong QJ [Tetrandrine Attenuated Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury and Induced Differential Proteomic in a MCAO Mice Model Using 2-D DIGE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23780673)Neurochem Res.(2013 Sep) [^](#ref-link-2)Ho Pharmacol.(1999 Feb 19) [^](#ref-link-4)Sim HJ, Kim JH, Lee KR, Hong J [Simultaneous determination of structurally diverse compounds in different Fangchi species by UHPLC-DAD and UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23652992)Molecules.(2013 May 7) B, Khan IA [Authentication of Stephania tetrandra S.
