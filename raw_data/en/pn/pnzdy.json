Hood is committed to the integration of the liberal arts, the professions and technology, to the exploration of values, a sense of community and to the preparation of students for lives of responsibility and leadership. a Hood education Hood provides a residential experience for undergraduate women and men, as well as graduate and undergraduate education for both women and men. Hood maintains a vital community that is enriched and energized as it responds to the intellectual, professional and personal goals of individual students of diverse races, ethnicities and ages. The Hood environment, both in and out of the classroom, promotes the understanding that learning is interactive among individuals and disciplines, that the exchange of ideas must involve the exploration of values and that education requires lifelong engagement. The Hood College community at all levels aspires to the highest standards of academic achievement and reaffirms the College's commitment to preparing students for the personal, professional and global challenges of the future. the Hood College advantage A commitment to academic excellence, distinguished teaching, a wealth of academic resources and personal attention all contribute to the Hood College experience. Involvement, friendship and commitment are valued by the Hood community. With an undergraduate population of more than 1,400, Hood offers an opportunity for every student to participate and to excel. Hood's emphasis is on teaching. More than 90 percent of the College's full-time faculty hold an earned doctorate. Hood supplements this core of professors with carefully selected adjunct instructors, many of whom are eminent scientists and professionals in their fields. Involved in professional and research activities off campus, Hood's faculty have strong connec - tions to colleagues in both the academic and the professional worlds. These relationships translate into excellent opportunities for students seeking internship placements, pursuing special academic projects and moving into graduate study or careers. Interaction between Hood's faculty and students begins in classes averaging 18 students. Beyond the classroom, students receive guidance, support and challenge from faculty advisers, col - laborate with faculty on research projects and share meals with faculty in Coblentz Dining Hall. academic and social life at Hood are governed by an Honor Code. Administered by students with the cooperation of the faculty and administration, the Honor Code fosters maturity and leadership and provides many opportunities to exercise responsibility and democratic self-gover - nance on campus. Hood College is committed to enrolling a diverse student population. Many of Hood's undergraduates are residential students who live in five residence halls or three language houses on campus. Hood also enrolls students who commute to campus from their homes in the area. The College welcomes transfer students from four- and two-year colleges. Agreements with com - munity and junior colleges in Maryland and other areas match earned credits with Hood's Core Curriculum requirements. Hood enrolls international students from 25 countries. the College has been recognized as a leader in lifelong education and in career develop - ment. The Adult Studies Program is uniquely responsive to the educational objectives and aspira - tions of adults (those age 24 or over). Hood's Graduate School offers master's degrees in 14 areas. These co-educational programs em - phasize professional preparation and are designed primarily for students requiring evening classes. On campus and off, Hood's academic resources are outstanding. Located less than an hour from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, the College has affiliations with regional businesses, research laboratories, embassies and international organizations, government agencies and nearby colleges and universities. a Hood edUCatIon 5tradition The Hood community values its distinctive traditions that foster strong bonds of friendship and create enduring memories for alumnae and alumni. First-year students are greeted on their arrival by upperclass students who help orient them to campus life. The entire student body looks forward to the Freshmen Bash, which signals the start of the social year. Parents, siblings and other family members are invited to share the spirit of Hood by attending Family Weekend and special events, including art festivals, concerts, fairs and athletics. For many Hood families, the annual performance of Handel's \"Messiah\" by the Hood Choir is the highlight of the holiday season. Strawberry Breakfast on graduation day, \"Give Your Heart to Hood\" day, Sophomore Dinner, Junior Ring Dinner and Spring Parties are all part of a legacy that connects Hood students to the thousands of alumnae and alumni who have shared these traditions over the past 100 years. The academic community includes dedicated faculty, enthusiastic students and professional staff who share a deep commitment to academic inquiry. the Honors Program For the academically-exceptional student, Hood's four-year Honors Program emphasizes analyti - cal skills, writing and speaking ability, multidisciplinary perspectives and an understanding of national and international issues. The Honors curriculum includes interdisciplinary study, collaborative learning and a distinctive sophomore seminar combining scholarly study with an ex - periential community service-based project. The Marx Center serves as a center for the program, providing spaces for meetings, student project activity and studying. departmental Honors Paper The Departmental Honors Paper is a senior-year program designed for students who wish to pur - sue intensive research or special projects in close coordination with faculty advisers. All Depart - mental Honors papers are included in the permanent collection of the Beneficial-Hodson Library. For further information, please see page 48. leadership and Service opportunities At Hood, students have the opportunity to gain recognition for community service as well as for academic accomplishments. Each year, approximately 30 Hood students are selected for inclusion in Who's Who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges, and 21 Hood sopho - mores are inducted into the Ionic Society, an honorary organization recognizing those who pro - vide service to the College. Membership in Mortar Board, a national honor society, is accorded to a select group of students who are outstanding academically and are campus and community leaders. The Catherine Filene Shouse Career Center offers assistance to students wishing to pursue intern - ships or careers in nonprofit and service organizations. 6 a Hood edUCatIonCommunity Service and Service learning The College's motto, Corde et Mente et Manu (With Heart and Mind and Hand), expresses the value placed on service by the Hood community. Opportunities abound for students to engage in service learning that is community-based and enhances the major field of study. the office of Service learning , located in the Catherine Filene Shouse Career Center, provides interested students with the opportunity to learn through service to others. Here, student volun - teers are matched with local, regional, national and international community service experiences. the Second Century Foundation encourages academic initiative and public service by award - ing up to $2,000 each year to Hood sophomores, juniors and seniors conducting independent research or carrying out community service projects. Hood's Center for Community Research , housed in the Sociology and Social Work Depart - ment on the third floor of Alumnae Hall, gives students the opportunity to work collaboratively with members of the Frederick community to design and carry out research that meets a commu - nity need. Students from a variety of fields\u2014including sociology, law and society, environmental studies, chemistry, political science and social work\u2014apply their research skills to help solve real-life problems while, at the same time, giving organizations and groups in the Frederick area access to some of Hood's resources.

Students, faculty and staff share in campus activities and tradi - tions. College life a Hood edUCatIon 9Hood believes that living as a member of a community provides the best atmosphere for indi - vidual growth, so all students are afforded varied opportunities to participate in and lead activities at the College. Because Hood recognizes that students require both challenges and caring guid - ance to grow, a full range of student services and activities is available. The College is committed to supporting the personal and social development of all students, recognizing that life beyond the classroom walls is a vitally important part of the college experience. the Honor Code Academic and social life at Hood is guided by an honor system. The basic aims of the honor system are: to encourage and promote a trustful relationship among all members of the College community, to offer students the opportunity to exercise responsibilities and democratic rule on campus and to make students more aware of their personal principles of honor. The academic Honor Code belongs to and is administered by students, with the cooperation of the faculty and administration. A judicial system of students, faculty and administrators considers and adjudicates violations of academic integrity. While Hood's social Honor Code contains spe - cific requirements, it is primarily a philosophy to promote mature consideration of and respect for the rights of all members of the College community. Violations of College policy are adjudicated through the Office of Residence Life, the Dean of Student's Office, Department of Campus Safety and/or student review boards as appropriate to the violation. Student staff members are employed by the Residence Life Office as resident assistants to assist in reporting violations, although all students retain the rights and responsibilities to report any infractions they witness. Through the honor system, all members of the College assume the obligation to maintain the principles of honesty, responsibility and intellectual integrity in all activities relating to their Hood College experience. It is the responsibility of each student to maintain the Honor Code and to support it with maturity of thought, expression and action. Members of the faculty, staff and administration are available to assist students in this process. While both the academic and social Honor Codes are student-governed, any member of the College community can report and hold students accountable for infractions. During orientation, all students must sign a pledge to uphold the Honor Code for the duration of their enrollment at Hood. The Honor Pledge reads as follows: \"Recognizing the importance and value of the Hood College honor system, I pledge on my personal honor that I will uphold the honor system for the duration of my enrollment at Hood College. Furthermore, I pledge that I will read and make every effort to understand the concepts of the honor system.\" Residential life The residential life program provides students with an opportunity to live with students from diverse backgrounds, encouraging them to learn from others' experiences. Living in the residence halls helps students learn communication, negotiation and conflict management skills. There are five traditional-style residence halls on campus (Coblentz, Coblentz Memorial, Meyran, Shriner and Smith) that house between 100 and 120 students each. Smaller language housing options for between five and 25 students each attract students who are interested in a French, German or Spanish living experience. One faculty member from the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures serves as the language house coordinator. A native speaking graduate student lives in the house full time. Traditional-aged first-year students and sophomore students are required to live on campus in doubles unless they are commuting from their parents' home. Juniors and seniors are eligible for singles on a space-available basis. Students who feel they have special needs may apply for a single through the special singles program. During the summer prior to their arrival, first-year students are assigned a roommate based on a lifestyle questionnaire. First-year students may request a specific roommate if they know someone else coming to Hood with whom they would like to live. During the spring semester, all current residential students select their rooms and roommates for the upcoming academic year. Hood's residence halls are self-governed and residents elect representatives to the Student Govern - ment Association, as well as their individual house councils. Students decide when their quiet 10 College lIFehours will be and when visitors may be in the halls (within certain minimum guidelines). In addition, the governing bodies of the halls work to provide educational and social activities for their residents. Resident assistants live on each residence hall floor and are available to students who have personal or academic concerns, are having problems with their roommates or just need advice, guidance or a referral. They plan programs, disseminate information and work to build a positive community on their floor by enforcing college policies. The RAs are supervised by Graduate Resident Directors. GRDs live in each of the five larger residence halls. Their responsibilities include community building, shaping positive student behavior, programming, student support and supervision of building staff. For further information about the residential experience at Hood, please contact the Residence Life Office at ext. 3577. Commuter life Commuter students represent a diverse population of traditional-aged students and adult learners. When not attending classes, many commuters spend time in the Whitaker Campus Center. The Commuter Student Union, in which all matriculated undergraduate commuting students hold membership, elects its leadership team, the Commuter Council, to govern the Commuter Student Union and administer its programs. Various members of Commuter Council sit on student government committees and boards, giving voice to commuter interests. Parking Vehicle registration and a parking hang tag are required. Vehicles registered for the regular aca - demic year do not require an additional tag for the summer session. A parking hang tag does not guarantee the holder a parking space, which is on a space-available basis. Parking in the Whitaker Campus Center lot is restricted to commuter students, faculty and staff. Vehicles parked in violation will be ticketed. Campus Safety may designate certain areas as no parking zones for snow removal purposes. Vehicle registration forms are available in the Office of Campus Safety and at the switchboard. Please refer to the student handbook for details, or contact the Department of Campus Safety at ext. 3548. Student government All undergraduate, matriculated students are members of the Hood College Student Government Association. The student government at Hood represents the voice of the student body to the faculty and administration and is responsible for overseeing many vital aspects of student life. The HCSGA consists of a student senate, which takes up issues of importance to the student body and enacts legislation; a judicial branch, which is responsible for the honor system; and an executive board, which administers the business of the student government and oversees its committees. Through its Campus Activities Board, the HCSGA provides social activities for students, and through its Finance Committee, it allocates the student activities fees to support the administra - tion and programs of the clubs under its auspices. House Forum oversees the governance of the residence halls, working with the Assistant Dean of Students and Residence Life and Judicial Affairs to implement policies and procedures, while Commuter Council, working with the Director of Commuter Life and Student Activities, oversees the Commuter Student Union and its programs. The Academic Affairs Committee has members serving on or observing at many academic committees of the College, representing student views. The Parliamentarian reviews the constitutions of all prospective student organizations, ensuring that the Senate and Executive Board follow appropriate procedures in conducting meetings. The Student Rights Committee serves as another voice for students regarding individual or group concerns. The Dean of Students serves as adviser to HCSGA. Student organizations Clubs and organizations provide students with opportunities to meet others with similar interests as well as to develop leadership, organizational and management skills. Under the auspices of the HCSGA, a wide variety of clubs and organizations is available. In addition, a number of student groups and honorary organizations are sponsored by departments of the College. Each year, as College lIFe 11new students with new interests join the Hood community, new clubs and interest groups are formed. The following clubs, organizations and interest groups are currently active on the Hood campus. academic Interest organizations Art Club Least Squares Mathematics Club Education Club Psychology Club Environment Club Student Social Work Organization Free Radicals (chemistry club) Honor Societies Alpha Psi Omega Phi Alpha Theta Beta Beta Beta Phi Kappa Phi Gamma Sigma Epsilon Pi Delta Phi Ionic Society Pi Mu Epsilon Kappa Delta Pi Psi Chi Mortar Board Sigma Beta Delta Omicron Delta Epsilon Sigma Delta Pi Phi Alpha Sigma Phi Omega Performing arts Chamber Singers Hood Theatre Choir Removed Confusion (drama club) Gospel Ensemble String Ensemble Hood Dance Wind Ensemble Publications Blue & Grey Today (newspaper) Wisteria (literary magazine) Touchstone (yearbook) Special Interest organizations SADD International Club Best Buddies Intervarsity Christian Fellowship Black Student Union Jewish Student Union Campus Activities Board La Union Latina Catholic Campus Ministry Literary Club Circle K (Kiwanis) Maryland Student Legislature College Democrats Muslim Student Association College Republicans National Model United Nations Commuter Student Union PRSSA (Public Relations Society Student Association) Equestrian Club STARS (Admission's tour guides) Film Society Student Athletic Advisory Council House Councils Student Government Association House Forum T.E.A.

In the admissions process, the greatest weight will be given to the applicant's secondary school record, including the curriculum completed and grades earned. Strong consideration is also given to the scores on standardized tests such as the SAT or ACT. There are no arbitrary Grade Point Average or test score requirements; each student's record is assessed in light of his or her past ac - complishments and potential for future success.

In order to accurately assess a home-schooled applicant's likelihood of success at Hood, we will require several forms of documentation in addition to the usual application materials. Applicants for admission to Hood College who have completed some or all of their secondary education in a home-schooling environment will be required to submit the following: n A transcript of all high school-level work, evaluated, signed and approved by the certifying home school agency. n Two letters of recommendation (with at least one from outside the home) n An admission interview (either in person or by phone) n Official transcript of any college work completed or in progress.

The Departments of Education in several states (notably, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, New York and the District of Columbia) do not recognize a home schooling certificate as an equivalent to a high school diploma. The College must be able to certify that all degree-seeking students hold a high school diploma or its equivalent, or have proven the ability to benefit from a college education. transfer With ease Hood welcomes transfer students into both the traditional and Adult Studies programs.

The portion of unearned aid must be returned to the federal programs. When unearned aid is returned, a student may owe the College additional funds.

Hood College determines the type and amount of aid students may receive by evaluating the student's financial need and availability of funds. Eligible students receive awards on a first-come, first-served basis. Financial need To determine a student's financial need, the student must complete the Free Application For Student Aid. Need for financial aid is determined by the following calculation: Cost of attendance less expected Family Contribution equals Financial need To determine the Expected Family Contribution, the calculation formula used is the Federal Need Analysis set by the U.S. Department of Education. Factors that are taken into consideration include: family size, number of students in college, income and assets of both the student and parents and the age of the oldest parent. The FAFSA may be completed on the Web at the following address: www.fafsa.ed.gov. Paper applications are available from most high school guidance offices, from Hood College and public libraries. Complete the FAFSA fully and carefully to avoid delays in processing. FAFSA forms should arrive at the Federal Processor no later than February 15 to receive full consideration for all types of need-based aid. For Hood College to receive your FAFSA results, you must list our school code: 002076. Financial aid Package After your financial need is determined, the Office of Financial Aid can begin to put together a financial aid \"package.\" Each student's financial situation is different, so each financial aid pack - age is unique. A financial aid package will include one or more types of financial aid. The most common types of financial aid include: scholarships, grants, loans and work-study. 26 UndeRgRadUate tUItIon and FInanCIal aIdAll need-based financial aid awards are made in accordance with three criteria: enrollment in a degree-granting program at Hood College, demonstrated financial need and the student's ability to maintain satisfactory academic standing. For many of the need-based financial aid programs, students must be enrolled for at least 6 credits per semester. In addition, for a student to be eli - gible for any federal financial aid, the student must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident of the United States; have a high school diploma or equivalent; not be in default on a Federal Perkins Loan or Federal Stafford Loan; and be registered with Selective Service (if required). Completed files are acted upon on a first-come, first-served basis. Some types of aid have limited funding. Students who qualify for financial aid are notified in the form of a financial aid award letter. This award letter is sent to admitted students in the spring prior to the academic year for which financial assistance is sought. Continuing students will receive their award letters beginning in April prior to the fall semester. Financial aid Programs Federal Pell grants \u2014Awarded to undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need. Annual awards may range up to $4,731 depending upon need; prorated awards may be made to eligible part-time students. Students must be pursuing their first baccalaureate degree.

The scholarships and grants most frequently awarded to Hood students include, but are not limited to, the Educational As - sistance Grant, the Guaranteed Access Grant, Senatorial Scholarship and Delegate Scholarship. In order to be considered for a Maryland State Scholarship, a student must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by March 1. Some state scholarships may have additional ap - plication requirements. Please check with the Maryland Higher Education Commission-Student Financial Assistance at (800) 974-0203 or www.mhec.state.md.us veterans' educational benefits \u2014Hood College serves as a liaison/informational resource to veterans by providing Veterans Administration forms and certifying eligibility status. To initiate or continue benefits, veterans must contact the Registrar's Office at the beginning of each semes - ter and comply with the policies and procedures established by the Registrar and the Veterans Administration. Information and application forms may be obtained from the Registrar's Office located in the Joseph Henry Apple Academic Resource Center. All students, including veterans, are required to pay the usual fees to the College at the time of registration. Satisfactory academic Progress Requirements for Financial aid Recipients Students are expected to maintain a record of academic achievement that will enable them to graduate in a reasonable time period. Federal regulations require that students who are recipients of financial assistance through federal programs continue to make satisfactory progress toward degree requirements according to standards set by the College. In order to graduate a student must complete 124 credits and have a minimum cumulative G.P.A. of 2.0. To remain eligible for most types of financial aid, particularly federal and state assistance, students must meet minimum academic requirements at the end of each academic year. Students are considered to be mak - ing satisfactory progress toward degree completion for financial aid purposes by adhering to the schedule outlined below. SeMeSteR CoMPleted CRedItS eaRned CUMUlatIve g.P.a. Second Semester 25 1.50 Fourth Semester 50 1.70 Sixth Semester 75 1.90 Eighth Semester 100 2.00 Tenth Semester 124 2.00 A financial aid recipient who does not meet the standards listed above will remain eligible for financial aid for one semester on financial aid probation. A student who is on probation must achieve a standard that shows progress toward the next end-of-year standard. (For example, at the end of three semesters 37 credits and a 1.60 G.P.A..) Failure to reach such a standard will result in federal financial aid suspension (loss of eligibility) until such time as the student gets back on schedule. A student who loses financial aid through this process may appeal the decision, but such an appeal would be successful only if extenuating circumstances were involved and described by the student. All appeals will be reviewed individually on a case-by-case basis. The appeal process is covered more fully in a later section. Students who receive a Hood College Scholarship or Grant will be eligible to receive those funds for a total of eight (8) semesters. Anyone requiring longer than eight semesters cannot be assured of continued Hood College funding. It is also important to note that this standard for satisfactory progress toward the completion of degree requirements is different from the standards imposed by the Registrar and the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. Students can possibly receive academic warnings and still be eligible for financial aid. Likewise, some students may be on financial aid probation while meeting academic requirements of the Registrar at the time. Transfer students will have progress based upon the inclusion of transfer credits from prior institutions. The Hood College academic year is 30 weeks in length of instructional time and a student must be enrolled for all of those weeks for financial aid eligibility. Additionally, it is important to note that the minimum course load per year is 24 credits for many state and federal programs and full- time status is considered to be 12 credits per semester. 28 UndeRgRadUate tUItIon and FInanCIal aIdThe Office of Financial Aid will notify any students who do not meet the minimum requirements and any questions with regard to any of the outlined policies should be referred to that office. treatment of W, InC, aU, F, S and U grades and Repeated Course - work n Course withdrawals (W) after the drop/add period are not included in the G.P.A. calculation, but are considered a noncompletion of attempted coursework. n Incomplete (INC) grades are not included in the G.P.A. calculation but are considered a non - completion of attempted coursework until the incomplete grade is replaced with a permanent grade and academic progress can be reevaluated. n An audit (AU) grade is not considered attempted coursework. It is not included in the G.P.A. calculation or completion rate determination. n A satisfactory (S) grade is treated as attempted credits earned, but it is not included in the G.P.A. calculation. n An unsatisfactory (U) grade is treated as attempted credits that are not earned, but it is not included in the G.P.A. calculation. n A failing grade (F) is treated as attempted credits not earned; it will be included in the calcula - tion of the G.P.A. and the minimum completion rate. n All grades earned for a repeated course will be included in the calculation of the G.P.A. and every repeated attempt will be included in the completion rate determination. Financial aid Probation Students who fail to meet the minimum cumulative G.P.A. standard for the appropriate class year will be placed on financial aid probation for the next semester of enrollment. Financial aid can be received during the semester of probation. Financial aid Suspension Students who, while on financial aid probation, fail to maintain the minimum cumulative G.P.A. for the appropriate class year, will have their financial aid canceled. Students who fail to complete their degree within 165 attempted credits will have their financial aid canceled. Reinstatement of aid after Financial Suspension Reinstatement of financial aid after a student is placed on suspension is achieved as follows: n The student submits a written letter of appeal in accordance with the appeals process and the Financial Aid Appeals Committee grants the appeal. The student is placed on financial aid probation for the semester rather than on suspension; or n The student attends Hood College during the suspension semester, pays for tuition and fees without the help of student aid and does well enough in the coursework to satisfy all the satisfactory academic progress standards. The student must notify the Office of Financial Aid if they are planning to attend Hood College without the assistance of financial aid; or n The student may attend summer school to eliminate the deficiency in credits or G.P.A. The student must notify the Office of Financial Aid if they are planning to take classes during the summer to eliminate the deficiency. Students cannot take classes at another institution to resolve a G.P.A deficiency. Classes must be taken at Hood College. Students who have been placed on suspension cannot skip a semester and regain eligibility. No financial aid will be disbursed during subsequent semesters for students on suspension. Students who have exceeded 150 percent of their program length cannot regain financial aid eligibility except on a semester by semester basis through the appeal process only. UndeRgRadUate tUItIon and FInanCIal aId 29appeals Process Appeals of financial aid suspension must be made in writing to the director of Financial Aid by the date specified in the Suspension notification letter. The Financial Aid Appeals Committee will review the appeal and notify the student in writing within 5 working days of their decision. All decisions made by the Financial Aid Appeals Committee are final and not subject to further review. The appeal letter must address the extenuating circumstance(s) why satisfactory academic progress was not made, why the extenuating circumstance(s) has changed, as well as an outlined plan for future academic success. Extenuating circumstances can include, but is not limited to, illness or injury; death of a family member; family difficulties; interpersonal problems with friends, room - mate, significant others; difficulty balancing work, athletics, family responsibility; or financial difficulties. Merit Scholarships Hood College has developed an extensive merit scholarship program that recognizes outstanding achievement and/or demonstrated talent and accomplishment in leadership, research, community service or writing. Students admitted to Hood are considered for merit scholarships at the time of admission. Some scholarships, however, are awarded through an interview process involving our Faculty Scholarship Committee. Each year, Hood College awards more than $5 million in merit-based scholarships. Merit-based scholarships range from $2,000 to full-tuition. From time to time, an individual student-applicant may qualify for consideration in more than one scholarship category. In such a case, the highest scholarship amount will take precedence in Hood's awarding process. All are limited up to eight semesters. Students are notified of yearly renewal criteria, including minimum grade point average, upon receipt of their financial aid award letter.

Students without the associate degrees mentioned, but transferring with at least 56 credits, should refer to the General Studies Requirements/A.A. Equivalence at the end of this section. Transfer students pursuing the B.S. in Computer Science should refer to Core Requirements - Bachelor of Science Degree on page 43. The purpose of the Core Curriculum is to provide students with the basic skills needed to pursue a liberal arts education, to expose them to a variety of modes of inquiry in different disciplines, and to help them develop a better sense of historical perspective in both Western and non-West - ern civilizations. The Core Curriculum is composed of three parts: Foundation, Methods of Inquiry and Civiliza - tion. Foundation (14-19 credits) The Foundation section of the core presents the fundamental skills necessary to pursue a liberal arts education. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to write with clarity in English; solve basic mathematical problems and demonstrate some ability to inter - pret and present numerical data; realize the relationship between physical and mental well-being, and perform at least one physical education activity; function successfully using the four skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) of a foreign language and develop awareness of a foreign culture. Methods of Inquiry (22-23 credits) Different disciplines in the liberal arts have distinct ways of pursuing their inquiries. The five cate - gories in this section require that the student will become acquainted with some of these methods. Each course in this section will provide opportunities for students to acquire the capacities that enhance all study: intellectual curiosity, critical analysis and reasoned judgment; focus on methods of inquiry appropriate to the category, including significant achievements in the field; require the practice of writing; be appropriate for first- and second-year students. the five Methods of Inquiry categories are: aesthetic appreciation (6 credits) courses introduce students to the analysis, understanding and enjoyment of artistic expression. They will present significant works, explore the relationship between these works and human experience and require critical response from students. Students will include one course in literature and one course in art, music, film or another appropriate field. literature (3 credits) Upon satisfactory completion of the literature requirement, students will be able to read with perception the literature they have studied; analyze significant aspects of this literature; and intelligently discuss relationships between the literature and human experience. art, Music, Film or other Media (3 credits) Upon satisfactory completion of the art, music or film requirement, students will be able to discuss at least one of these media from a critical and aesthetic perspective; analyze the development of different genres or styles of expression in at least one of the media; and explain how these media address human values and experience. Scientific thought (7-8 credits) courses promote the student's understanding and apprecia - tion of science, the scientific approach to problem solving and the importance of science in our society. Courses will focus on the methods of scientific analysis as well as the actual content of the science. Students will take two semesters of introductory science courses, at least one of which will include a laboratory or similar experience. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to understand the introductory content of at least one of the sciences; explain and use the scientific approach to problem solving; and understand scientific or technological information written for nonprofessional audiences. 36 UndeRgRadUate degRee ReqUIReMentSHistorical analysis (3 credits) courses introduce students to an analysis of human affairs that goes beyond the mere narration of historical facts by acquainting students with the methods historians use to describe, explain and reconstruct the past. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to make use of historical information found in primary source materials; place significant works in their proper historical and cultural context; assess the complex relationship between historical events and the human condition; and chronologically order and explain the significance of major events and the development of key social and political institutions for at least one period of history. Social and behavioral analysis (3 credits) courses introduce students to the study of human behavior and/or the structures of society by acquainting students with the methods used for solv - ing problems in the social or behavioral sciences. Upon satisfactory completion of this require - ment, students will be able to identify the essential features of society and culture or the major factors of human behavior, either in general or as they apply to particular social, political or eco - nomic issues; describe the structures and functions of some major social institution or analyze the effect of social structures on their own and others' attitudes and behavior; analyze and synthesize information that deals with social or behavioral issues, distinguish between relevant and irrelevant information and lines of reasoning and form appropriate conclusions. Philosophical Inquiry (3 credits) courses teach students to think in a disciplined and rea - soned way about questions of reality, meaning and value by approaching such questions either theoretically or through examples that may be drawn from different disciplines or cultures. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to analyze, in a preliminary way, questions about reality, meaning, or value; discuss some of the traditional views on such questions; and develop criteria to arbitrate differences between conflicting normative claims about thought or behavior. Civilization This section specifies that students will have some knowledge of the foundations of Western civi - lization, of at least one non-Western culture and of the impact of science and technology on the modern world. Courses in this section are numbered at the 300 or 400 level and are usually taken during the junior or senior year. Western Civilization (3 credits) courses may come from any discipline but must take as their primary focus the reading and consideration of one or more major works in Western civilization. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to demonstrate how at least one major work influences the values, beliefs and institutions of Western civilization; assess the development of some key Western values, modes of thought or institutions in their historical context; and organize and interpret information found in primary source materials. non-Western Civilization (3 credits) courses may come from any discipline, but must take as their primary focus the study of at least one non-Western culture. They will discuss the develop - ment of thought and values in that culture and require close scrutiny of one or more of its major works. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to outline the development of some pivotal values, modes of thought or institutions in a non-Western culture; show how at least one major work influences the values, beliefs and institutions of a non-Western civilization; place significant works in their proper historical and cultural context; and understand something of the relationships among different cultures, societies and nations. Society, Science and technology (3 credits) courses may come from any discipline but must focus on selected technological or scientific developments or issues of significance and their impact on human history and society. Upon satisfactory completion of this requirement, students will be able to understand, from a nonprofessional perspective, the scientific concepts, laws and principles underlying some major technological achievements; assess certain significant scientific or technological achievements and their impact on human society or the natural environment.

At least one of these fields must be declared during the spring of the sophomore year. Students must identify the sec - ond major in the same manner during the spring of the junior year. Students should consult the appropriate department chairperson for assignment to a second adviser in the second major. Double majors must meet the major requirements of both departments and may apply no more than 90 credits of work in the double major to the 124 credits Hood requires for graduation. All courses offered within the major departments are counted in the maximum, even if the courses are not required for the major; the courses may count for requirements in both majors, but the credits can only count toward one major. Students must confer with both advisers prior to each registration. In programs where there is great overlapping of requirements, a student may not double major (e.g., law and society and political science or sociology). the Interdepartmental Major The purpose of the major is to allow students with superior achievement to use the existing courses, curriculums and programs to structure an individualized program of studies with the guidance and assistance of a program advisory committee. Working with the Program Advisory Committee, consisting of faculty members from the rep - resented disciplines, the student submits a petition of interdepartmental major requirements no later than March 15 of the sophomore year to the Committee on Academic Standards and Poli - cies for consideration. Transfer students with first-semester junior status must submit petitions no later than October 15 or March 15 of the first semester on campus. To graduate as an interdepartmental major with an individually designed program, a student must have at least 15 credits in one of the areas represented in the major and at least 12 credits in another field. The proposed major must total at least 36, and no more than 60 credits (200 level and above). 300- and 400-level courses including a capstone course are strongly recommended. Approval is necessary before the student implements the program. The individualized program is a contract and, as such, is binding. Students may count toward the major only those courses which are included in the program out - line. (Courses within the disciplines contained in the interdepartmental major, but not included in the program outline, are considered electives.) If a student wishes to revise the approved program, the primary adviser will assist and the Pro - gram Advisory Committee must approve the amended outline by majority vote. Any amendments must be submitted to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies for approval. However, no significant changes will be permitted if the student is within 36 semester hours of graduation. Minors The following minors are offered at Hood: African-American Studies Coastal Studies African and Middle Eastern Studies Computer Science American Studies Criminology and Delinquency Archaeology Economics Art History Environmental Studies Biology French Business Administration French/German Chemistry German Classical Studies Gerontology Global Studies Public Relations History Religion UndeRgRadUate MaJoRS, MInoRS and CeRtIFICateS 45Journalism Renaissance Studies Literature Social Science Research Management Social Work, Pre-Professional Practice Mathematics Sociology Mathematics Education Spanish Medieval Studies Studio Art Music History and Literature Theater and Drama Music Performance Web Development Philosophy Women's Studies Physics Writing Political Science Students may choose from a variety of programs which the College has designated as minor fields of study. the purposes of the program of minors are as follows: n To provide opportunities for students to pursue in a focused and integrated manner programs of study not currently available as majors; n To use existing resources to provide distinctive and challenging curricular opportunities; n To provide an alternative to double majors for students who wish to pursue more than one program of study; n To integrate further the liberal arts and career preparation through opportunities to combine a liberal arts major with a career-related minor or a career-related major with a liberal arts minor; and n To enable graduates to prepare for careers or further study in more than one area of concen - trated knowledge. The grouping of courses in a minor may be identical to a concentration. However, a concen - tration is elected by students within a major, while a minor is elected by students majoring in another field. The minor consists of a minimum of 15 credits of course work, forming a coherent program relating to a specific academic objective. Students are allowed to have two majors and a single minor, or a major and two minor fields. Minors are not required of students. the following are requirements for a minor: n A minimum of 12 credits in the minor must be taken outside the student's major and may not overlap with the major. If there is additional overlap, the credit must count in the major. The course may be used to fulfill a requirement in the minor, but the credit may count only in the major. n If a student elects a second minor, a minimum of 12 credits must be taken outside the first minor. Courses may be used to fulfill requirements in both minors, but the credit may count only in one minor. n Students must have a Grade Point Average of 2.0 and a minimum of 9 credits completed at Hood College for the minor to be listed on the academic record. n A maximum of 21 credits may be counted in the minor. n Courses counted in the minor may also count in the Core. n Declarations of a minor occur during the spring semester of the junior year when students submit the graduation audit, listing their intended minor field, to the Registrar's Office. n Students may develop their own minor, with the approval of the department or departments that are teaching those classes relative to the student's proposed minor and of the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies, provided they meet the minimum number of credits and course levels required of minors. 46 UndeRgRadUate MaJoRS, MInoRS and CeRtIFICateSSecondary education Certification Hood offers preparation leading to State of Maryland secondary teaching certification (middle through high school) in eight subjects: biology, chemistry, English, French, history, mathematics or Spanish and art (K-12).

It encompasses the technolog - ical, scientific, historical and cultural aspects of issues currently challenging our wise use of coastal resources. The program provides both on-campus and off-campus experiences for students from Hood as well as those from other institutions. The Coastal Studies Semester is open to students of at least sophomore status (regardless of major) who have completed a freshman writing class and at least one laboratory science course. Throughout the fall semester, participants will live, work and study at marine field stations and environmental centers. Participants will earn 14 to 16 semester hours of academic credit by taking a block of courses specifically designed for them. For Hood College students, the courses taken during the semester will satisfy several college-wide requirements including the Scientific Thought and the Society, Science and Technology courses of the core curriculum. Additionally, students can obtain a minor in Coastal Studies by success - fully completing the fall semester and participating in one of the Coastal Studies Field Experi - ences which are offered during January and summer semesters. See page 90 for more information on the Coastal Studies Semester. departmental Honors Paper The Departmental Honors Paper is a senior-year program designed for students who wish to pursue intensive research or special projects in close coordination with faculty advisers. The course number 499 designates this type of study. Students writing Departmental Honors Papers are designated Christine P. Tischer Scholars. All Departmental Honors Papers are included in the permanent collections of the Beneficial- Hodson Library. Study abroad Programs Hood students may study abroad in approved programs in virtually every part of the world. The College requires language majors to study abroad unless they reside for two years in one of the language houses. Language students ordinarily enroll in programs abroad that offer instruction in the local language. Hood has formal associations with several established overseas programs, including those offered by Sweet Briar College (Paris), Dickinson College (Toulouse), University of Seville, University of Alicante, Seoul Women's University, Sookmyung Women's University and the Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra (Santiago, Dominican Republic), among others. Students may also study abroad in short-term summer programs: Social Work Field Experience in Ireland (co-sponsored by Hood College and Frostburg State University) and the Bahrom Interna - tional Program in Seoul, Korea. Language students planning to study abroad should consult with the faculty of the Foreign Lan - guages and Literatures Department; other students should consult with the Provost. All students intending overseas study should make application at least one semester in advance of the proposed study. The College encourages students to study abroad during the junior year. Some sophomores study 48 UndeRgRadUate SPeCIal aCadeMIC oPPoRtUnItIeSabroad because of compelling program or personal reasons, and in rare instances the College permits seniors to study abroad in the fall semester. the Hood College Honors Program A limited number of academically exceptional students are accepted into the Hood College Hon - ors Program. Combining classroom instruction and co-curricular activities, the Honors Program offers a challenging academic experience and encourages both independent and collaborative learning. The program requirements are discussed in Undergraduate Programs and Courses of Study. Independent Study and X-Credit Independent study includes directed readings; conferences with a supervising instructor; and papers, reports and/or exams. Two kinds of independent study are available at Hood: regular (designated by the course number 375) and X-credit. Regular independent study consists of a project designed by a student and approved by a faculty adviser with whom the student will work closely during the semester. The number of credits may vary from 1 to 3 according to departmental policies and the design of the independent study. The subject chosen may not duplicate any course offered during the period of the student's enrollment at Hood. Registration procedures and deadlines for regular independent study are the same as for all departmental courses. X-credit independent study also is designed by the student and approved by a faculty adviser. However, the subject matter must be related to a class in which the student is enrolled. X-credit independent study is, therefore, added to the student's schedule after the beginning of the semes - ter (but no later than the sixth week) and is limited to one credit. The grade for the X-credit is independent of the grade for the course to which it is related. Before registering for regular or X-credit independent study, students should refer to the state - ment on credit limits for self-directed study in Undergraduate Academic Policies on page 56. Internship Program Hood encourages qualified students (mainly juniors and seniors) in every academic discipline to take an internship, earning academic credits by working in their field, under the supervision of a professional. Internships of 3, 6, 9, 12 or 15 credits are available (depending on the discipline). The number of credit hours allowed for a summer internship is limited to 12 and is limited to 3 credits in January term. Students are encouraged to visit the Catherine Filene Shouse Career Center to explore internship opportunities. See page 54 for more information on internships. off-Campus Programs and Courses engineering: dual degree Program Hood College and The George Washington University jointly offer a five-year program through which students earn a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in mathematics from Hood and a Bachelor of Science in engineering degree from The George Washington University specializing in civil, electrical or mechanical engineering; operations research; or computational science. For additional information, contact Hood's Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. UndeRgRadUate SPeCIal aCadeMIC oPPoRtUnItIeS 49Plen Hood College is an associate member of The Public Leadership Education Network. PLEN offers exciting programs that allow Hood students to gain firsthand experience shaping public policy in communities, the nation and the world. Students who enroll in PLEN's Women and Public Policy Internship Program learn about policy, research or social advocacy by working alongside women leaders in the Congress, courts, executive agencies and nongovernmental advocacy groups. Students may earn from 3 to 15 Hood College credits for participation in PLEN's internship programs. Those who wish to complete a PLEN internship must also meet Hood's requirements for internship eligibility. PLEN also offers three-day to three-week seminars on topics such as Women and Congress; Women in Science and Technology; Women and International Policy; and Women, Law and Public Policy. For more information about any of PLEN's programs, contact the Career Center. Washington Semester Program Hood College cooperates with The American University's Washington Semester Program, an arrangement which provides priority access to Hood students who join 300 to 400 other students from across the country. Students may enroll in any of the units of the program: American National Politics Semester, Foreign Policy Semester, Justice Semester, Public Law Semester, Eco - nomic Policy Semester, Peace and Conflict Resolution Semester, Journalism Semester, Museum Studies and the Arts Semester, International Business and Trade Semester and International Environment and Development Semester. The director and academic advisers of each unit help students plan their programs, including a seminar, an independent research project and either an internship or a course at The American University. Entrance requirements include a Grade Point Average of 2.5, second-semester sophomore status, a recommendation from the Hood faculty adviser to the program and selection by the director at The American University. Credits (but not quality points) are transferable to Hood. Because financial arrangements for room, board and tuition differ from those at Hood, students are urged to consult with the Hood financial aid officer well in advance. Hood students need not file a petition with the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies to participate in the Washington Semester. Community College exchange Full-time Hood students may take one course each semester at Carroll Community College (CCC), Frederick Community College (FCC) or Hagerstown Community College (HCC) with - out charge, provided that the course chosen is not offered at Hood during the academic year. See Academic Policies, page 68, for more information on this program. 50 UndeRgRadUate SPeCIal aCadeMIC oPPoRtUnItIeSUndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeS academic Honor Code All Hood undergraduates affirm on each class assignment that they \"have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid.\" Cheating or plagiarism\u2014any unacknowledged use of another person's language or ideas\u2014is thus both an affront to the general standards of conduct on which an intellectual community depends and a specific violation of the Honor Code. As such, these offenses are treated seriously and may lead to severe disciplinary action, including dismissal from the College. For a full description of the policies and procedures of the Honor Code, contact the Dean of Students. Students wishing advice on the proper use and acknowledgement of scholarly materials should consult their individual instructors, the library staff and any of the several reliable guides to schol - arly writing that these sources may recommend. academic Honors Commencement Honors Students qualify for Commencement Honors if they have achieved the following composite aver - age at the time of graduation (see Grade Point Average and Quality Points on page 62): Summa Convocation Honors Convocation Honors are awarded to current sophomores, juniors or seniors who achieved a 3.6 or above G.P.A. for the preceding year. The College bases this G.P.A. on at least 12 semester hours of Hood work (or approved study away) on letter-grade basis. Students who have received incomplete grades for the year are not eligible. dean's list The Dean's List recognizes degree-seeking students who completed at least 6 semester hours of Hood work (or who have received permission to study abroad or away for a semester) and achieved a 3.5 or above semester G.P.A. Students who have received incomplete grades for the semester are not eligible. Hood College Scholar A Hood College Scholar, named at the beginning of the junior or senior year, is the student who received Convocation Honors for at least two consecutive years (may include approved study away). A student who has graduated from the College is not eligible to become a Hood College Scholar. academic Standing and Classification n Classification n Academic Standing n Academic Warning n Academic Probation n Academic Dismissal n Dismissal and Reinstatement n Financial Aid Implications UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeS 51Classification Classification standards are as follows: Freshman: fewer than 25 credits earned. Sophomore: 25-55 credits earned. Junior: 56-86 credits earned. Senior: 87 or more credits earned. academic Standing Students are in good academic standing when both the semester and cumulative Grade Point Averages are at least 2.0. Hood makes every effort to assist students to maintain this academic standard. It is the student's responsibility to take advantage of the College's academic, health and psychological counseling services as a means of overcoming problems impeding progress. At the end of each semester, the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies considers the records of those students who have earned a semester or cumulative average below 2.00, and examines the records of students previously placed on academic warning or probation. Academic action by the Committee is based not only on the academic record, but includes input from the offices of Residence Life, Disability Services, Student Affairs and the student's instructors and adviser, regarding issues such as attendance and completion of assigned coursework, and issues from outside the classroom that may have affected a student's academic success. Based on all the information, students will be placed on academic warning, academic probation, required leave of absence or be dismissed from the College. In addition, students whose record indicates potential for academic difficulty, e.g., two or more Incomplete grades might be required to carry a reduced credit load for the following semester. academic Warning A student will be placed on academic warning if his or her semester Grade Point Average (G.P.A.) falls below 2.0. academic Probation A student will be placed on academic probation if his or her cumulative Grade Point Average (G.P.A.) falls below 2.0. Academic probation means that a student is in danger of being dismissed from the College for academic reasons. Students on academic probation must make satisfactory progress the following semester or risk being dismissed. Students on academic probation may not register for more than 16 semester-hours without per - mission from the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. Students who are placed on Academic Probation will be required to sign the Contract for Stu - dents on Academic Probation. This contract requires students to assume responsibility for their academic status by attending classes regularly, completing assignments on time, using the Writing Center and Math Skills Center as well as tutoring services and/or doing whatever is appropriate to resolve their specific academic problems. academic dismissal The College, upon recommendation of the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies, may at any time dismiss a student who is experiencing academic difficulty. This policy applies to all students, including first semester first-year students. Although all cases are decided individu - ally, the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies will use the following guidelines when reviewing academic records: 1. Students whose cumulative Grade Point Averages (G.P.A.) fall below the following levels will be dismissed: 52 UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeStotal Semester Hours attempted Minimum Cumulative Hood g.P.a. First semester at Hood 1.40 15-29 credits 1.60 30-42 credits 1.75 43-55 credits 1.85 56 and above 2.00 2. Students with three consecutive semester averages below 2.0 will be dismissed. 3. The College reserves the right to dismiss at any time any students who fail to meet minimal standards of academic responsibility or who are deemed to be a detriment to themselves or to others, as determined by the Vice Presidents of Academic Affairs or Student Life. Such grounds for dismissal could include but are not limited to ceasing to attend classes, disrupting the life and work of the College community, or completing any semester with a term grade point aver - age below 1.0. This policy applies to all students, including first-semester first-year students. 4. Students who are dismissed from the College may not enroll in classes as a nondegree seeking student. exceptions: 1. Students with more than two consecutive semesters on probation may be permitted to remain at the College only if the student has earned a G.P.A. above 2.0 in the most recent regular (fall or spring) semester and in the opinion of the Academic Standards and Policies Committee is making satisfactory progress toward the completion of degree requirements. 2. The Committee on Academic Standards and Policies Committee may make exceptions to the above-mentioned guidelines based on input about unique circumstances from the Offices of Residence Life, Academic Services, Disability Services, Student Affairs and/or the student's instructors and adviser. Appeal for exemption from dismissal may be granted by the Provost and Dean of the Faculty in unusual circumstances and following consultation with the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies, the student's instructors and advisor, and other relevant offices. Appeals for rein - statement must be received two weeks prior to the first day of classes. Students whose appeals are granted will be readmitted to the College for one semester on a provisional basis. Failure to com - ply with the conditions specified in the letter allowing them to return to the College will result in their dismissal at the end of the provisional semester, if their minimum G.P.A. for retention is not attained. dismissal and Reinstatement Students who are dismissed for academic reasons may petition for reinstatement after complet - ing a minimum of one full-time semester at another accredited institution and receiving no grade below a C. The following is the procedure for possible reinstatement: n The student writes to the Registrar to request permission to return to Hood. n The student provides transcripts of work attempted elsewhere or other pertinent information. n The Committee on Academic Standards and Policies reviews the request and makes a decision regarding reinstatement. A student who is reinstated will be placed on academic probation. Reinstatement does not auto - matically reinstate financial aid. The student must notify the Office of Financial Aid. If a student is dismissed for nonacademic reasons, the student must request in writing to the Dean of Students permission to return to Hood. The Dean of Students decides if the student may be reinstated. Financial aid Implications Financial aid recipients are required to be in good academic standing and maintain satisfactory academic progress toward degree requirements.

Students may enroll for a maximum of 12 credits of internship during the summer and 3 credits in the January term. The number of credits available also varies by department. Note: Students may take a maximum of 15 internship credits throughout their academic career. applying for an Internship Students considering an internship should visit the Career Center to explore internship options and pick up appropriate paperwork, including a Learning Agreement to be signed by the faculty internship adviser and the on-site supervisor. Responsibilities All parties have specific responsibilities for ensuring the integrity and success of the internship ex - perience. Please refer to the Internship Handbook available on the Career Center Web site (www. hood.edu/careercenter) for additional details. Supplemental expenses and time In fulfilling the expectations of the internship, the intern may incur expenses in addition to the usual tuition and fees. Students who enroll in an internship must plan to provide their own trans - portation or use public transportation. Due to the time requirements of an internship, students may need to work during breaks and holidays. Campus housing is available when the College is not in session. Placement is not guaranteed Interns are not placed in sites and it is the student's responsibility to find a site. The Career Cen - ter and departmental offices provide many resources to the student to assist in locating a suitable internship termination of Internship Under unusual circumstances, any party involved in the internship may terminate the agree - ment. Because the internship is essentially a professional commitment, Hood strongly encourages students to fulfill their obligations to complete the full term of service at the site. Unfortunately, on rare occasions, the intern or the Faculty Internship Adviser may determine that the internship site is not an appropriate learning experience, or the internship site may determine that the intern is not a good fit for their internship. In either case, any of the parties may decide to terminate the internship. If this occurs, notify the Career Center immediately. Please note: If an internship is terminated for any reason, the student is responsible for following all procedures regarding adding/ dropping credits and is responsible for all tuition, fees, and penalties associated with credit coursework. Please refer to the Internship Handbook available on the Career Center Web site (www.hood. edu/careercenter) for additional details. 54 UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeStime Requirements A student must work a minimum of 40 hours at the internship site for each credit earned. Self-directed Study Hood defines self-directed study as: 1) regular and X-credit independent study; and, 2) intern - ships, field work and other courses similar to internships in that they do not have a classroom component. n Students may take a maximum of 27 credits (excluding an honors paper) in self-directed study in the total 124-credit program. A combination of internships and independent study must not exceed 15 credits of internship or 12 credits of independent study. n Students may take a maximum of 18 credits (excluding an honors paper) in self-directed study in the major program. A combination of internships and independent study must not exceed 15 credits of internship, 12 credits of independent study or more than 1/4 of the major pro - gram (whichever is less). n Students may not add independent study credits to internships to fill a complete semester program. An exception to this rule is independent study that students take at the Washington Center for Learning Alternatives or through a similarly structured program. n Independent studies are granted to nondegree students under only exceptional circumstances. teaching assistantships Many departments offer students the opportunity to serve as teaching assistants, for which academic credit is awarded. Serving as a teaching assistant affords a student the opportunity to understand the materials of a course or of a laboratory from the perspective of the teacher. The course number 335 designates this type of study. limits/Restrictions: n A total of 4 credits of Teaching Assistantship may be counted towards the degree. The course may be taken for 1-3 credits and may be repeated at the discretion of the department. Depart - ments have the right to limit the number of credits granted per semester and may or may not allow students to repeat the course. n As a general guideline, a student should work at least three hours per week for each credit granted in the assistantship. attendance and absence The College does not set a maximum number of absences permissible in any course. Individual faculty members have the prerogative to establish a maximum number of absences at the begin - ning of the semester, and are encouraged to include a written statement of their attendance policy on the course syllabus. Instructors may refuse students permission to make up work missed through absence not caused by illness or emergency. Students accept full responsibility for seeing that work does not suffer from excessive absence. The College recognizes that there are other justifiable reasons for class absence: observance of religious holidays or participation as a representative of the College in athletic contests or cultural performances. Such absences are acceptable only if previous absences are not excessive and if the student has made arrangements with the instructor, prior to the day of the absence, for the work missed. limits/Restrictions: n Students must attend the first class meeting of each of their courses or notify the instructor or the Registrar's Office of their absence, or risk being withdrawn from the class with a grade of WX. n Enrollment in a course constitutes an informal contract with the instructor, and a student who violates an instructor's attendance policy risks dismissal from the course and a grade of W, WS, WU or W-F. UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeS 55n A student who is dismissed from a course for excessive absences or who is withdrawn from the class for failing to appear at the first class meeting may be reinstated only by the joint consent of the course instructor and the Registrar. n Classes are held up to the date and hour preceding vacations and they resume promptly after the recess in accordance with the academic calendar. Students are expected to attend classes meeting just prior to and immediately following holiday periods. n Students are fully responsible for making up work missed due to class absence. When students are absent, they are responsible for obtaining lecture notes from reliable sources. Assignments and projects are to be delivered to the instructor on the assigned date, even when the student does not attend class. All exams are to be taken at the scheduled time. Having another exam scheduled on the same day is not considered sufficient justification for rescheduling the exam. The College requires instructors to inform the Director of Academic Services of students who demonstrate erratic attendance patterns. This is not done to penalize the student but rather to ensure that College officials can assist students in making consistent progress toward the degree. Credit for Prior learning n Advanced Placement n CLEP n DANTES n Departmental Examinations n Foreign Language Placement Examinations n International Baccalaureate n Portfolio Advantage Program n Military Experience Hood awards credit for prior learning through Advanced Placement exams, CLEP and DANTES exams, departmental challenge exams, portfolio work, International Baccalaureate, military train - ing and noncollegiate programs approved by the American Council on Education. These alterna - tive modes of learning are evaluated separately from transcripts of traditional transfer credit from other accredited schools. See Transfer Credit on page 67. limits/Restrictions: n Credit for prior learning is awarded only to students admitted as degree candidates. n A maximum of 30 hours of credit may be earned through any combination of prior learning credits and Hood courses elected on the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis. n Students may not receive credit by examination for any course that they have previously au - dited, failed, received credit or from which they have withdrawn. n Credit through examination or portfolio may not be attempted during the final 15 hours of credit. n Credit through examination or portfolio may not count in the minimum of 30 Hood credits required for the degree. n The requirement of 12 credits of coursework at Hood in the major cannot be fulfilled by port - folio credit or through credit by examination. 56 UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeSadvanced Placement Unless otherwise noted, Hood College awards credit upon receipt of the official aP grade Report for aP scores of 4 or 5 for the following tests: art: Art History, 3 credits for ART 220 and exemption for ART 221 Studio Art, 3 credits for ARTS 101 or 123 (score of 3 is acceptable).

Students who have received an IB Diploma, with a score of 30 or higher and with no score less than 4 in any one of the six examina - tion groups, may be awarded up to 30 credits toward an undergraduate degree at Hood College. Students who have not completed the full IB Diploma will receive 6-8 credits for Higher Level examination results of 5, 6, or 7. Portfolio advantage Program Hood College awards credit for alternative modes of learning. Students who have acquired college-level learning through life experiences and other noncollegiate activities may want to explore Hood's Portfolio Advantage Program. This program enables a degree-seeking student to earn credit for prior learning through work and/or volunteer experience equivalent to college-level courses. Students should do so only if the learning cannot be assessed through standardized or departmental measures. At Hood, the portfolio is an organized presentation of a student's past experiences that identifies and documents specific skills that the student has learned, mastered and applied to be successful. Once the written portfolio is completed, the document is reviewed and evaluated by a member of the faculty who will determine if what the student has written is equivalent to what is taught in class. It is the portfolio that enables a professor to evaluate work and volunteer experience and to grant credit for relevant learning beyond the classroom. UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeS 59to participate in Hood's Portfolio advantage Program: n Once admitted as a degree-seeking student, students must register for at least 3 credits before they can begin the Portfolio program. Three credits of coursework must be earned before portfolio are awarded. n Degree candidates interested in the Portfolio Advantage Program are required to attend a six- session portfolio development workshop. The workshop fee is $850 for 2008-2009. n Portfolio documents must be submitted within one year of completing the workshop. n Portfolio credit may be awarded only if the learning is appropriate to Hood's general education requirements, electives and/or specific programs. Based on the quality of writing and construc - tion of the portfolio and the content, credit will be awarded for work equivalent to a grade of C or better. Military experience Hood recognizes the unique nature of the military lifestyle and has committed itself to easing the transfer of relevant course credits and crediting learning from appropriate military training and experiences. Students need to provide a copy of their DD214 and/or ACE/AARTS transcripts. One credit in physical education is awarded for military basic training. First Aid Certification will receive elective credit for PE 214. double-numbered Courses and Undergraduate enrollment in graduate Courses Certain courses have been designated as appropriate for both graduate students and undergradu - ates. These double-numbered courses are identified by numbers in both the 400 and 500 range. Undergraduate students enroll in a double-numbered course at the 400-level and receive under - graduate credit. Graduate students enroll at the 500-level and receive graduate credit. Undergraduate students must meet different performance standards from the graduate students. These differences may relate to the quality and/or quantity of work required, and may also involve measures of grading. to be eligible to take a 400/500-level course , undergraduate students must have a cumulative Grade Point Average of 2.0 or better and have earned at least 56 credits, including 12 credits or more at the 200-level or above in the course discipline. to be eligible to take a 500-level graduate course and receive undergraduate credit , Hood undergraduate students must have earned senior status (87 credits) including 12 credits or more at the 200-level or above in the course discipline; have a cumulative Grade Point Average of 3.0 or better; have a Grade Point Average of 3.0 or better in the major area of study; and complete a petition, verified by the Registrar and approved by the Graduate School, the adviser and the instructor. Credit will count only toward the undergraduate degree. to be eligible to take a 500-level graduate course and receive graduate credit , Hood un - dergraduate students must have earned a minimum of 109 credits and meet the requirements in - dicated above. Credit will not apply toward the 124 credits required for the undergraduate degree. Final examinations Instructors give final examinations in all courses except those in which special assignments are more appropriate. Instructors inform students of final examination policy at the beginning of the term. Final exam dates are listed in the official Academic Calendar, and students' travel plans must take the dates of scheduled exams into account. No student may reschedule a final examina - tion in order to leave or travel early. In accordance with the Hood College Honor Code, the student may not discuss any final examination in any way with anyone during the final examina - tion period. Final examinations may not be given prior to the start of the designated examination period. Financial obligations Grades, transcripts, future registrations and diplomas will be withheld until the student has paid all tuition, fees and other bills incurred at the College, and has returned all library books. 60 UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeSgrades n Grading Criteria n Grade Changes n The Hood Grade Point Average n The Composite Average n The Major Average n Course Repeat Policy n Midterm Grades n Final Grades n Incomplete Grade Policy n Grade Appeal grading Criteria Hood's faculty uses the following general criteria in determining grades. Demonstration of the ability to write and speak standard English is included in the grade evaluation of every course. The criteria upon which students will be evaluated is included on every course syllabus. a, a- (90-100) indicates general excellence; the student displays initiative, independence and often originality in the course. b+, b, b- (80-89) indicates an unquestioned grasp of the subject's fundamental facts and princi - ples, an understanding of their significance and an ability to use them effectively; work is logically organized and technically correct; the student often shows initiative and independent work. C+, C, C- (70-79) indicates the student has a fairly accurate knowledge of the subject's fundamen - tal facts and principles and is able to apply them reasonably well; work is fairly logical in organiza - tion and technique but it is incomplete; there is evidence of growth in handling the coursework. d+, d, d- (60-69) indicates work is of inferior quality yet deserving of credit; there is some ac - quaintance with basic facts and principles but work is poorly organized and technically faulty; the student frequently fails to complete assignments. F (0-59) indicates work shows no grasp of basic facts and principles and is not deserving of credit; it is poorly organized and technically faulty; the student frequently fails to complete assignments. S indicates satisfactory completion of work done on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis; perfor - mance is at a C- level or better. U indicates unsatisfactory completion of work done on a Satisfactory/ Unsatisfactory basis and not deserving of credit; performance is at a D+ level or lower. InC indicates incomplete work in a course because of illness or serious emergency beyond the student's control; students must arrange to finish assignments in accordance with the College's incomplete grade policy. UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeS 61grade Changes Instructors have the right to change a grade if they have made an error in computing or recording a student's grade. Instructors must notify the Registrar's Office in writing of the error within three weeks after the grades have been issued. Grade changes due to a computational or recording error discovered after the deadline, and requests for grade changes for any other reasons, must be submitted by the instructor in writing to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. the Hood grade Point average The average that appears on all transcripts and grade reports is the average of all grades earned at Hood. Accepted transfer credit is included in the earned credit total and is applied toward the 124-credit degree requirement, but the quality hours and quality points earned at another institu - tion are not calculated in the Hood average. Foreign language majors and students participating in a Hood-sponsored, affiliated or approved semester or year abroad program at the University of Seville or the Dominican Republic programs may earn quality points for work accomplished with a passing letter grade Each grade received at Hood on the A-F grading scale has no quality points include: AU, S, U, INC, Z, TR, W, WS, WU, W-F By computing the quality points received for each letter grade, students can ascertain their average or grade point average. For example, a grade of C in a 3-credit course earns 6 quality points. Add the number of quality points earned in each course to learn the quality point total. Divide the quality point total by the total number of credits (in courses which have letter grades) and the result is the Grade Point Average (G.P.A.). the Composite grade Point average The composite Grade Point Average is the average of all college work attempted. All grades earned at Hood and those completed at other institutions are calculated, regardless of whether the course credit was accepted for transfer. The composite average is used to determine eligibility for various honor societies as well as determining Commencement honors. the Major average An academic department may refuse to accept as a major a student whose G.P.A. falls under 2.0 in the discipline. The department may require a student who has declared a major to drop the major if the student's G.P.A. falls below 2.0. Course Repeat Policy A student may repeat a course under the following circumstances: n Failure (F, U) in the course previously. n Enrollment in a course on a credit basis after previously auditing the course. n Course description states that a course may be repeated (e.g., Math 335). n Grade of C- or below has been earned in a 100- or 200-level course. n Failure to meet minimum grade required in a prerequisite course Students are limited to one (1) repeat of any given course. All grades earned for a given course will remain on the academic record and be computed in the Grade Point Average. Credit will be awarded only once. Students may not repeat a course at Hood for which transfer credit has been awarded. Midterm low grades Students who earn a low grade at mid-semester (C-, D+, D, D-, F, U or INC) receive a notice of low grade(s). The low grade report does not become a part of the student's permanent record, but is, instead, an indication of the need for corrective action. 62 UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeSFinal grades Hood releases final grades electronically to the student and the student's adviser through IQWeb. Final and midterm grades will be forwarded to parents/guardians of first-year students who have signed a release form sent to them the summer before they enter Hood. Incomplete grade Policy When serious illness or emergency prevents a student from completing the work for a course, instructors may allow additional time to finish assignments. Incompletes are not substitutes for failure to attend classes or to complete assigned work. limits/Restrictions: 1) The student must file an application for an incomplete grade with the Registrar's Office. 2) An incomplete may not be granted unless a student has completed at least half the work of the course. 3) The student's progress in the course must be satisfactory at the time the incomplete is re - quested. 4) The Registrar must approve a notation of incomplete and record an INC on the student's permanent record. After the instructor assigns a grade, an \"I\" remains permanently on the record with the final grade earned beside it. 5) The date agreed upon for completion of all assignments may not be later than March 15 for fall semester and October 15 for spring or summer semester. Any request for extension of an incomplete grade must be submitted by the student to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. 6) Work not completed by the deadlines stated above will convert to a grade of F unless an exten - sion is approved by the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. 7) Students who register for a subsequent semester with more than three credits of incomplete outstanding will have their schedules reviewed and their enrollment registration potentially restricted by the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. As a result of this review, the Committee may limit the course load that a student is permitted to undertake in the subsequent semester. grade appeal Grade appeals of the final course grade must be filed in a timely manner. Students must contact the faculty member involved within the first week of the semester following the filing of the disputed grade. If the issue is not satisfactorily resolved, the department chair must be contacted within 30 days. Appeals to the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies must be initiated before the end of the semester following the filing of the disputed grade. A Final Grade Appeal, available in the Registrar's Office, must be completed and submitted with all required documents before the Committee considers the petition. A delay in the filing of a grade appeal constitutes sufficient reason for denial of the appeal by the Committee. The Committee on Academic Standards and Policies will screen out frivolous or unsubstantiated appeals and will consider legitimate appeals that fall into the following categories: n Miscalculation of a grade; or, n Assignment of a grade to a particular student by application of more exacting requirements than were applied to other students in the same course. n Assignment of a grade on some basis other than performance in the course. All parties to the grade appeal (student, instructor, chairperson, registrar, committee members) are to maintain strict confidentiality until the matter is resolved. UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeS 63graduation and Commencement Participation graduation In the spring of the junior year, rising seniors, who plan to graduate in the following year, are sent a graduation audit form from the Registrar, indicating their progress toward fulfilling degree requirements. This audit begins the graduation clearance process which continues through the senior year. Students should meet with their faculty advisers to review degree requirements and to plan their senior year registrations. In October of the senior year, seniors are sent an Application for Graduation form to complete and return to the Registrar's Office by November 1. Bachelor degrees are awarded in January, May and September. Commencement Participation Students who have completed all degree requirements by the date grades are due for the second semester may participate in the May commencement. See page 35. Students graduating in January participate in the May commencement ceremony. Students com - pleting degree requirements in September participate in the May ceremony the following year. Students may not participate in commencement unless all degree requirements and all financial obligations to the College have been met. Registration and enrollment n Registration n Drop/Add Period n Course Withdrawal after Drop/Add n Audit n Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grade Plan n Course Schedules n Cancellation of Courses Registration Advising and registration for degree candidates occurs in April for the fall semester and November for the spring semester. Matriculated students are required to meet with their advisers to select courses and review degree progress. The adviser authorizes the student for registration and, on the day indicated on the Academic Calendar, the student registers for classes via IQWeb. drop/add Period Students may drop or add courses without academic penalty from the time of registration through the end of the Drop/Add period. See the Academic Calendar for dates. During this period students may also change to or from the SU (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory) grad - ing option (see below), change to or from enrollment on an audit basis, or alter the number of credits in courses carrying variable credit. Course Withdrawal after drop/add If a student withdraws from a course after the end of the drop/add period, but within the first six weeks of the semester, a W (indicating withdrawal) will be noted on the transcript. This notation will not be computed in a student's grade point average. After the sixth week of classes up to the end of the 11th week of classes, one of the following will be noted on the transcript: n WS if the grade average for the course at the time of withdrawal is C- or above n WU if the grade average for the course at the time of withdrawal is D+, D or D- n W-F if the grade average for the course at the time of withdrawal is F These notations will be indicated by the instructor on the withdrawal form and will not be com - puted in a student's Grade Point Average. 64 UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeSa student may not withdraw from a class during the last three weeks of classes. audit With instructor permission, a student may enroll in most lecture courses as an auditor. As the term implies, auditors listen rather than engage in class discussions and projects. Auditors attend class regularly but do not write papers or take exams or quizzes. limits/Restrictions: n The student receives neither credit, grade nor grade points for an audit; however, the audit does appear on the transcript. n There is no limit on the number of courses that a student may audit during a semester. If the audited course or courses cause a student to exceed 18.5 credits, the excess credits will be billed by the undergraduate per-credit-hour fee. n It is not possible to audit courses such as creative writing, painting, drawing, labs and other courses where the nature of the activity requires the participation of the student. Students may enroll on a non-credit basis in such courses by paying the current per-credit-hour fee. n No changes to or from the audit option may be made after the end of drop/add period. n A student may take for credit, at a later time, a course that was previously audited. n Part-time students pay a reduced audit fee to audit a course (see page 25). Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grade Plan Hood provides an alternate grade plan as a means of encouraging intellectual curiosity. Under the satisfactory/unsatisfactory option, students receive a grade of S and credit for work of C- caliber or better or a grade of U and no credit for work of D+ or lower quality. Neither grade is computed in the cumulative grade point average. limits/Restrictions: n Students may not choose the S/U option for any course used to satisfy the Core, in the major field, the minor field or an independent study. If a course is only offered for S/U credit, this policy does not apply. n Students may choose the S/U option for a maximum of 12 satisfactory/unsatisfactory credits within the total 124 credits Hood requires for graduation. Students spending three years at Hood may choose the S/U option for only 9 satisfactory/unsatisfactory credits to meet gradua - tion requirements; two years, 6 credits; one year, 3 credits. Courses only offered for S/U credit are not counted in these totals. n At registration, students indicate their intent to take a course on the satisfactory/unsatisfactory plan on the course and schedule card. Change from one grading plan to another must have the adviser's approval and must occur before the end of the drop/add period. No changes to or from the satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading system may be made after the drop/add period. n Students are cautioned that some graduate and professional schools and employers look nega - tively at satisfactory/unsatisfactory on transcripts because actual performance or mastery of the subject has not been demonstrated. Course Schedules A credit hour usually represents one hour of class work and at least two hours of preparation in a given subject per week throughout the semester. Classes usually meet on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday or a Tuesday-Thursday schedule. Except for lab sessions, Monday-Wednesday-Friday classes generally convene for 50 minutes and Tues - day-Thursday classes for 75 minutes. Most evening classes meet once a week for 2-1/2 hours or twice a week for 75-minute periods. Classes are held between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 10 p.m. Hood also has blocked courses. These are courses which meet for double periods during a portion of the semester. Blocked courses are primarily studio art and education courses in the teaching internship semester. UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeS 65Cancellation of Courses A fall or spring semester course is subject to cancellation when fewer than eight students are en - rolled. Summer and January term classes are subject to cancellation when fewer than five students are enrolled. The College reserves the right to cancel the course as late as the first day of classes each semester. Every effort will be made to work with students regarding program planning and placement in alternate courses which would be compatible with the cancelled course. Student Status n Full-time and Part-time Status n Leave of Absence n Withdrawal from the College n Withdrawal from the College for Medical Reasons Full-time and Part-time Status Full-time status requires 12 credit hours or more per semester. A typical semester program con - sists of 15 or 16 credits except in the first year when it may be 12-15 credits. If the Admissions Committee decides that a student's skills in writing, math and reading need strengthening and the Basic Skills Inventories further support this decision, the student's adviser will help develop a program of 12-15 credit hours, including General Studies 101 and basic skills courses offered through the Office of Academic Services. Part-time status is accorded students taking 11.5 credit hours or fewer per semester. Students are normally limited to 12 credits completed during the summer. Exceptions to this credit limit require permission of the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. Students may complete a maximum of three credits during the January session. limits/Restrictions: n Enrollment in more than 18.5 credits in one semester requires a 3.0 cumulative average and permission from the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies. Enrollment in credits beyond 18.5 requires additional tuition for each hour or fraction above that number. n A student may not enroll in two courses which meet at the same hour. leave of absence Students who need to be away from the College for one or two semesters, but who wish to maintain ties to the College and to resume their studies at a later time, may take a leave of absence instead of withdrawing. Students who do not return from a leave of absence after two semesters will be withdrawn. A leave of absence is arranged with the Office of the Registrar. Students do not file a leave of absence form in order to study abroad or at another institution in the U.S. Instead, they must file a petition with the Committee on Academic Standards and Poli - cies for approval for study elsewhere. Withdrawal from the College A student may withdraw from the College at any time during the semester. See Tuition and Financial Aid for refund information. If the withdrawal occurs during the first six weeks of the semester, a grade of W will be recorded for each course. For withdrawals occurring after the first six weeks of the semester, a student will receive a grade of WS (C- or better), WU (D+ to D-), or W-F (withdrawn failing). Withdrawal from the College for Medical Reasons A student withdrawing from the College for medical reasons must submit medical verification to receive receive a grade of W for all coursework, regardless of the time of the withdrawal. 66 UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeSStudent Information, Records and transcripts Family educational Rights and Privacy act The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974 (P.L. 93-380) extends to students the right of access to their education records maintained at the College. The Provost, the Dean of the Graduate School, and the Registrar maintain these records for enrolled and former students. Information and notification as to the type of record; the accessibility of and policies for maintaining, reviewing and expunging the record; and the procedures for inspecting, reviewing, obtaining copies of, or challenging the record are established by the appropriate offices. Student Rights and Public Information In accordance with College policy and FERPA, the following items are considered Directory Information and will be released in response to any inquiry, unless the student notifies the Registrar in writing that she/he does not wish this information released: class level, major, dates of attendance, name and dates of attendance at other institutions, degrees and dates awarded. transcripts In compliance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, transcript requests must be in writing and include the signature of the student. Forms are available in the Registrar's Office and online at http://www.hood.edu/adminservices/registrar.cfm. Normal requests are processed within 3-5 working days upon receipt of request. Up to five copies will be processed at no charge. There will be a $5 charge per copy for each request beyond five. Rush transcripts are processed in 24 hours of the next working day at a charge of $10 per copy, payable by cash, check, VISA or MasterCard, due at time of request. Rush service is not available during the beginning and end of the semester, commencement, and registration. No transcript will be released if the student has not satisfied all financial obligations to the Col - lege. transfer Policy and attending other Institutions transfer Policy Hood welcomes transfer students from four-year and two-year colleges. We have articulation agreements with many community colleges to encourage and assist students in their efforts to take appropriate courses prior to transfer. The Registrar evaluates prior college coursework and credit earned through alternative methods for applicability to degree requirements at Hood College. Credit is generally awarded for courses that are clearly applicable to a baccalaureate degree and for which the student earned a grade of C- or above. A maximum of 70 credits may be awarded for freshman/sophomore level work completed elsewhere. Although there is no limit for junior/senior level coursework, students will be awarded no more than a total of 94 credits for all college-level work completed. The transferability of credits from an institution that is not accredited by a regional accreditation agency may be considered upon receipt of documentation that demonstrates equivalency regard - ing course information, equivalencies, and learning outcomes. It is the student's responsibility to provide this documentation. The final 30 hours of the degree must be taken on the Hood campus (see Undergraduate Degree Requirements). In addition, the College requires transfer students to take a minimum of 12 cred - its of classroom instruction in the major discipline at Hood, regardless of the number accepted in transfer. Transfer students must submit their transcripts to the Registrar prior to enrollment. All transfer documents must be filed within the first semester of enrollment. The Registrar may refuse to award credit if students fail to meet this deadline. All grades earned at Hood and those completed at other institutions are calculated in the com - posite grade point average, regardless of whether the course credit was accepted for transfer. The composite average is used to determine eligibility for various honor societies as well as determin - ing Commencement honors. UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeS 67degree Students attending other Institutions Students may receive credit for coursework successfully completed at another accredited institu - tion during the academic year or the summer with prior approval of the department and the Registrar. Students must petition to take a course from another college during any semester or ses - sion. The course may not be offered at Hood during that semester/ session. Petitions are available in the Registrar's Office. The maximum number of credits that can be taken during the summer is one credit more than the number of weeks in the session for a maximum of 12 credits. Students may enroll for up to four credits during a three week January term. Credit is granted for grades of C- or above and the grade of TR will appear on the Hood transcript. Community College exchange Full-time Hood students may take one course each semester at Carroll Community College (CCC), Frederick Community College (FCC) or Hagerstown Community College (HCC) without charge, provided that the course chosen is not offered at Hood during the academic year. CCC also offers the exchange to Hood students during their summer sessions. To register, students obtain the consent of their advisers and the Hood Registrar. The Registrar will provide a statement of enrollment for registration at CCC, FCC or HCC. These transfer course grade ap - pears on the Hood transcript as TR. Grades earned on this exchange program are not computed into the cumulative average but are calculated in the composite G.P.A. 68 UndeRgRadUate aCadeMIC PolICIeSUndeRgRadUate dePaRtMentS aRt and aRCHaeologY dePaRtMent Professors: Frederick Bohrer, Anne Derbes associate Gessert, Laurie Taylor-Mitchell gallery director: Youngmi Organ The Department of Art and Archaeology offers a range of studio art, art history, art education and archaeology courses that prepare the student for graduate study or for a career in various profes - sions.

Education faculty are active in national professional organizations and in local schools as supervi - sors of students, consultants and researchers. Hood's full-time faculty is supplemented by adjunct faculty who are recognized as distinguished educators. Candidates completing the initial and post-baccalaureate teacher certification programs will gain the requisite knowledge, skills and dispositions to meet national, professional, state and institu - tional standards. As part of ongoing work to achieve national accreditation, the Department is guided by a Conceptual Framework that includes the following vision and mission statements and Institutional Outcomes. 72 aCadeMIC dePaRtMentSour vision as a department The Education Department envisions developing well-educated and well-prepared teachers and educational leaders who are self-actualized in both intellectual pursuits and pedagogical applica - tions. Mission Statement The mission of the Education Department is to prepare academically competent and professional educators who are committed to facilitating learning in a culturally diverse society. This mission reflects a commitment to providing a technologically enhanced environment in which to nurture highly skilled educators who have a broad base in the liberal arts, are active learners and are reflec - tive practitioners. Inherent in our mission is the awareness that education is a scholarly pursuit, a science, an art and a profession. In order to meet our vision and mission statements, the Educa - tion Department has framed six Institutional Outcomes that all candidates must meet. These IOs are assessed at various points in the programs of study. Institutional (department) outcomes We believe that the Education Department at Hood College prepares educators who: 1. demonstrate the subject matter content, pedagogical knowledge, teaching skills and profes - sional dispositions necessary to ensure that all of their students and clients learn. (CONTENT KNOWLEDGE and SKILLS) 2. use their knowledge of diversity to create learning environments that support the belief that all students can learn. (DIVERSITY) 3. use assessment data to guide practices that support the belief that all students can learn. (AS - SESSMENT) 4. use technology to enhance learning. (TECHNOLOGY) 5. communicate effectively with students, parents and colleagues in order to facilitate learning. (COMMUNICATION) 6. reflect on their practice and are committed to continued professional growth. (REFLECTIVE PRACTICE) Candidates enrolling in the Education Initial Teacher Certification Programs are assessed on these six Institutional Outcomes and their dispositional beliefs (commitment to continuous content knowledge and skills development; belief that all students can learn; belief that consistent and purposeful assessment guides practice and instruction; effective and ethical use of technology will enhance learning; effective communication with all stakeholders will facilitate learning and reflec - tive practice to inform and promote professional growth) as part of program expectations. The Education Department assesses these professional dispositions through written candidate assess - ments and through course expectations and can issue a dispositional alert if teacher candidates fail to meet these professional dispositions. Appropriate initial teacher certification professionals may fill out a dispositional alert form with a remediation action plan to notify the candidate of such concerns. Failure to complete the action plan may lead to program dismissal. All initial teacher certification programs (undergraduate and post-baccalaureate) require the candidates who intend to be program completers to use the Chalk and Wire e-Portfolio system to create a program portfolio with specified performance assessments and activities. Candidates interested in pursuing teaching certification will enroll in EDUC 204 Foundations of Education as their first education course and receive training on creating their program portfolio. Transfer students will receive e-Portfolio training when they enter the program. Facilities: Several facilities on campus serve as laboratories or curriculum materials centers for the teacher education program. The Onica Prall Child Development Laboratory School, founded in 1929, serves as a nursery school for 3- and 4-year-old children. Students observe and teach in the O.P.C.D.L. School. An elementary science and mathematics classroom and the instructional technology classroom are available to students. In addition, many courses are taught in the Tatem Art Building's \"Smart Room,\" which is equipped with instructional technology. Area school districts work cooperatively with the Education Department in offering numerous field experi - ences to teacher education students through Professional Development School partnerships. aCadeMIC dePaRtMentS 73Education students are engaged in continuous and extensive field experiences in the PDS and the O.P.C.D.L.

Music is a cornerstone of a liberal arts education and, as such, Hood offers majors and minors in music history and literature, performance and piano pedagogy. The music curriculum has the following objectives: development of the enjoyment of music, proficiency in the art of music, guidance in the understanding of music, preparation for a career in music and preparation for graduate school. Most members of the department are concert artists, some of whom have performed nationally and internationally. Several are recording artists, as well. Facilities: Hood's facilities for the study of music include eight practice rooms with Yamaha studio upright pianos, teaching studios with grand pianos (mostly Steinways), a large pipe organ, a practice organ (Rodgers), a harpsichord, a music-lab computer station and several perform - ing venues: Brodbeck Music Hall, Hodson Auditorium and Coffman Chapel. Hood also boasts an excellent collection of books, music, CDs and videos in the Beneficial-Hodson Library and Information Technology Center. Performances: Students have many performing opportunities through participation in honors recitals; performance labs; choir; chamber singers; the piano, wind, string, jazz and early music ensembles; and other smaller chamber groups. The choral groups perform several times each semester, including the annual \"Messiah\" performance, and the other ensembles present an end- of-the-semester concert each term. Numerous concerts each year by distinguished guest artists and faculty artists are also held. Credit by audition: Students who have a substantial background in applied music may apply for credit for that study by arranging an audition with the department. A maximum of 4 credits will be awarded, based on the audition. Credit by exam: Students may challenge any music history course through the 200 level (with the exception of MUSC 299) and any music theory course by taking a departmental exam. 76 aCadeMIC dePaRtMentSSuccessful completion of the exam with a grade of C or better will exempt the student from the course and the student will earn credit for the course. Programs offered: n Music Major (B.A.) Music History and Literature Concentration Music Performance Concentration Piano Pedagogy Concentration Music Minors n Music History and Literature Minor n Music Performance Minor applied Music Hood offers individual instruction in piano, organ, harpsichord, violin, viola, cello, string bass, flute, English horn, clarinet, oboe, saxophone, all brass instruments, voice and guitar. Begin - ning instruction in all areas is available with consent of the Department. In all instrumental areas except piano, organ and harpsichord, students are expected to provide their own instruments. Students may take applied music with or without earning credits. Normally, a student would need to practice about five hours a week for one half-hour* lesson, and eight hours a week for two half-hour lessons. Two half-hour lessons may be combined into one hour lesson each week, at the discretion of the instructor. One hour* of credit will be awarded for a semester of weekly half-hour lessons. Students taking applied music for credit must attend three department-approved concerts each semester and are expected to participate in performance labs scheduled throughout the semester. Applied music credits are awarded after the teacher certifies that the student has made reason - able progress, has successfully completed a departmental exam and has fulfilled the concert and performance requirements. Students must take a departmental exam in each applied area of study every semester, following two semesters of study. There is a modest fee for lessons and use of the practice rooms; several scholarships are available. A maximum of 4 credits by examination may be earned by students with an extensive background in applied music. *Hour and half-hour are interpreted in terms of the 50-minute class. Music ensemble Students may elect to enroll in a music ensemble for credit. String students would normally enroll in string ensemble, wind students would normally enroll in wind ensemble, voice students would normally enroll in choir or chamber singers and piano students would normally enroll in piano ensemble and a choral group. Majors in other areas will be assigned as appropriate. Students earn one-half credit for each semester of ensemble and may take up to six semesters of ensemble for a maximum of 3 credits during their Hood careers. Note: in all cases, the appropriate director must approve placement in music ensembles. PHYSICal edUCatIon dePaRtMent assistant Professor: Paul Soong (chair) At a time when the nation is witnessing an obesity epidemic, enjoys watching sports more than playing sports and has an aging population at risk for falls, health science and sport science bring together individuals with backgrounds in physiology and wellness and health education to work on these and many other important public health problems. The Department of Physical Education offers course work directed at increasing student aware - ness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle and physical activity and at gaining the skills and understanding basic to a lifetime of wellness. Students have the opportunity to complete lecture aCadeMIC dePaRtMentS 77classes focusing upon sports science and health education, as well as activity classes focusing upon physical fitness, creative expression, risk-taking and sports skills. Facilities: The College's sports facilities include two swimming pools, two tennis courts, a softball diamond, two playing fields, a one-mile exercise course and Gambrill Gymnasium. Included in Gambrill Gymnasium is a dance studio, gymnasium floor, aerobics room and weight room. The fitness facilities contain treadmills, stair machines, exercise bicycles, as well as weight machines and free weight equipment. Physical education Programs The basic instruction program in the Department of Physical Education (PE 100-199) is designed to encourage students' personal growth and understanding of the importance of physical activity in their lives. Students have the opportunity to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to enhance their quality of life and establish lifestyles that promote wellness. Courses are directed at physical fitness, creative expression, risk-taking and sports skills acquisition. the Core Curriculum requirement may be met by completing 2 credits of physical education 100-199 activity classes, or by completing one of the following courses: PE 225 Health Mainte - nance: Stress Assessment and Control, PE 226 Health Maintenance: Physical Fitness, PE 228 Life Wellness and Health or PE 250 Introduction to Exercise Physiology. Students who meet the requirement through the activity class program must complete at least one activity class from the aerobic conditioning and fitness category. Students who participate in two seasons of intercollegiate sports may be waived from a maximum of one credit of the physical education activity requirement. No credit is earned for the waiver and does not exempt the student from the aerobic conditioning and fitness PE requirement. Classes taken to complete this requirement must be taken for a letter grade rather than satisfacto - ry/unsatisfactory credit with the exception of PE 104 Swimming for Beginners. After completion of the requirement, students may elect additional classes on either a letter-grade or satisfactory/ unsatisfactory basis. the physical education requirement should be completed during the first year. PSYCHologY dePaRtMent Professors: Dana G. Cable, Linda J. Scott associate Professors: Robert W. Boyle Jr. (chair), Terry Martin, Wanda Ruffin, Ingrid Farreras assistant Shannon lecturers: Thomas Craney, Robert Kearney At the undergraduate level, the Department of Psychology offers the major in psychology. 78 aCadeMIC dePaRtMentSAt the graduate level, the department offers the M.S. degree in Thanatology for students with a variety of backgrounds interested in research, administration or service with those facing death and dying. Psychology is also offered as one of the possible concentrations in the Master of Arts in the Human Sciences degree. The purpose of the concentration in psychology is to broaden the student's perspective and increase understanding of the principles of human behavior as they apply to the student's current job role or career. The concentration is tailored to the individual student's needs and may focus on such areas as developmental psychology, the helping relation - ship or gerontology. Psychology faculty are distinguished scholars and include specialists in gerontology, behavioral medicine and thanatology. Complemented by experienced adjunct professors and Hood faculty from other disciplines, the department provides an integrated teaching approach. Programs offered: n Human Sciences (M.A.) n Thanatology (M.A.) n Psychology Major (B.A.) RelIgIon and PHIloSoPHY dePaRtMent Professor: David Hein associate Professors: Karen Hoffman (chair), Stephen Wilson The Department of Religion and Philosophy offers two majors: religion and philosophy. The department also offers minors in religion and philosophy. Four minors are co-sponsored by the department: African and Middle Eastern Studies, Classical Studies, Medieval Studies and Renais - sance Studies. The solid liberal arts foundation provided by either of these majors is a good beginning for a career in almost any field, including law, medicine and business. Religion and philosophy faculty are distinguished scholars and teachers who have extensive knowledge of the Bible, the religions of Asia, American religious history, theology and church history and the history of philosophy and ethics. Writing across the departmental curriculum: Departmental faculty strongly believe that stu - dents who take religion and philosophy courses should not only increase their knowledge but also improve their writing skills. Reading, thinking, writing and intelligent discussion are the principal means by which students engage with the subject matter of courses in religion and philosophy. In their written work, students will reflect clear thinking in clear writing. What students say cannot be separated from how they say it. Faculty, therefore, will assess students' papers on the basis of style and grammar as well as content.

The art and archaeology major with art history concentration introduces students to significant works of painting, sculpture and architecture, and helps them develop creativity, critical judgment and historical awareness. The major stresses art history, which places works of art in their histori - cal, cultural and artistic contexts. It also offers the student experience in the concepts, methods and materials of archaeology. Studio art, providing direct experience with design, drawing, paint - ing and other media, enriches the student's understanding of the creative process and is also an important component of the curriculum. For art majors, Hood's location near Washington, D.C., and Baltimore is especially valuable. Field trips to the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculp - ture Garden, Dumbarton Oaks, the Walters Art Gallery and other collections allow students to study major works of art firsthand. Internships are available with most of these museums and with advertising agencies, design studios and cultural institutions, such as the Library of Congress and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In Hood's Hodson Art Gallery, students may participate in the planning and installation of exhibitions by serving as gallery assistants. The major offers students a broad perspective on themes fundamental to the humanities. It also prepares students to pursue careers in museums, galleries and other cultural institutions, and provides a basis for graduate work in art history, museum studies, conservation, archaeology and other fields. Students are encouraged to take related courses in history, literature, foreign lan - guages, music, religion and philosophy. Those who plan to earn an advanced degree in art history or archaeology should take French or German in preparation for graduate school. The depart - ment strongly suggests that majors spend a semester or year abroad. Requirements for the Major The art and archaeology major with art history concentration requires a minimum of 31 credits in art with 24 credits at the 200 level or above. Students may take a maximum of 60 credits includ - ing 100-level courses. aRt and aRCHaeologY MaJoR 83 the following are required: ART 220 History of Art I ART 221 History of Art II ART 470 Seminar: Topics in Art History ARTS 101 Design I one additional course in studio art (aRtS) Five additional courses in art history (aRt) at the 200 level or above, except aRt 300, 335, 370 and 399. While the major emphasizes art history, studio art supports and contributes to the curriculum. Hood offers introductory courses in design, drawing, painting, photography, and ceramics and intermediate courses in drawing, painting, photography and ceramics. Advanced instruction in these areas, and introductory and intermediate work in printmaking and sculpture, are available through the Artist-in-Residence program, which allows students to study with talented artists individually or in small groups. There is a modest fee for participation in the program. A list of offerings by Artists-in-Residence will appear in the fall and spring schedule of classes. The study of studio art is important for students interested in art therapy. Students planning careers in art therapy should take a minimum of 15 credits in studio art and 15 credits in psychol - ogy in preparation for graduate school.

Majors in biology obtain a broad and modern education in the biological sciences. The course of study includes the biology core courses that cover the fundamentals of cell biology, ecology, evolution, genetics and physiology. Elective courses provide for study at greater depth and reflect the breadth of biology. The major allows students to specialize or take a broad range of elective courses as they and their advisers deem appropriate. Elective courses are designed to help prepare students for graduate and professional school and biology-related employment. The capstone ex - perience allows biology majors to synthesize and apply the knowledge and skills gained in earlier coursework and serves as a transition to post-baccalaureate training and employment. Course offerings in the biology department are well balanced and broad, ranging from animal behavior to recombinant DNA technology. In all courses, material focuses on principles and their application to current topics in each of the fields. Advanced, double-numbered elective courses allow qualified seniors to study in depth in their chosen fields. Almost all courses offered for the major include laboratory instruction. Laboratory curricula complement lecture material and em - phasize hands-on learning through experimentation. As students progress through the curriculum they are challenged to develop increasingly sophisticated experimental and analytical skills. Some courses also include trips to undertake field research and to tour industrial and research sites of interest. The curriculum for biology majors provides excellent preparation for many different careers. Options for graduates include research positions with government and private agencies in the laboratory or in the field. Students are well prepared for post-baccalaureate programs in medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry, physical therapy and clinical laboratory science. Graduate study in a specialized field of biology is another excellent option for students majoring in biology. The biology faculty play an active role in assisting students throughout the process of achieving their career goals.

Engineering is a profession that offers many opportunities to both women and men. A liberal arts background combined with a major in mathematics and technical training gives a prospective engineer an added academic dimension. In cooperation with The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., Hood offers a five-year dual degree program in engineering. Students spend the first three years at Hood as mathematics majors, taking the core courses for engineering and courses in the humanities and social sciences. At the end of the three years at Hood, students transfer to The George Washing - ton University into one of the engineering programs offered there, provided that they complete the designated required courses with a grade of C or better and are recommended by the adviser of this program, the chair of the Department of Mathematics. Advisers at both Hood and George Washington work together to assist in this transfer agreement. At the successful completion of the five-year program, the student is eligible to receive two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from Hood College and a Bachelor of Science degree from The George Washington University. The engineering programs available at The George Washington University are biomedical, civil, electrical, computer, mechanical and systems engineering. In order to meet Hood requirements, a student in the dual degree program must complete the Hood College Core Curriculum requirements and must complete a specified set of courses in chemistry, computer science, mathematics and physics. Selection of courses to meet the Core Curriculum requirements and selection of elective courses should be done in careful consultation with a faculty adviser to ensure that the courses taken at Hood will satisfy the requirements of The George Washington University School of Engineering and Applied Science. In particular, a student must earn 18 to 21 credits in humanities and social science courses that are acceptable to The George Washington University. The following science and mathematics courses must be taken at Hood. CHEM 101, 102 General Chemistry I, II CS 284 Computer Science I MATH 320 Modeling and Simulation or MATH 456 Numerical Analysis MATH 112 Applied Statistics MATH 201, 202, 203 Calculus I, II, III MATH 207 Discrete Mathematics MATH 304 Differential Equations MATH 333 Introduction to Abstract Mathematics MATH 339 Linear Algebra MATH 351 Probability and Statistics MATH 440 Introduction to Abstract Algebra MATH 453 Introduction to Real Analysis MATH 470 Senior Seminar: History of Mathematics PHYS 203, 204 Introductory Physics I, II PHYS 222 Introduction to Modern Physics PHYS 325 Electricity and Magnetism (MATH 320 is required for prospective electrical engineering students.) 104 engIneeRIng dUal degReeenglISH MaJoR, b.a. The English Department offers a variety of courses designed to expose the student to a wide range of literary texts and critical approaches. In English classes, students read, analyze and write about literature from a number of historical periods. The faculty provides the personal attention that enables each student to learn to write well, to think critically and thus to acquire the skills neces - sary for success in any profession. We believe that such study enhances the love and appreciation of literature, exercises the imagination and frees the mind from credulity and conformity. Requirements for the Major English majors must take a minimum of 30 credits in English at or above the 200 level and no more than 60 credits (including 100 level courses). Nine credits must be at the 300 level or above, excluding independent study and internships.

HIStoRY MaJoR, b.a. The major in history is designed to address the diverse needs and interests of Hood College students by offering a choice of three recommended separate programs of study: 1) the major in history for general preparation, 2) the major in history option for a more intensive preparation for advanced study in graduate school and professional studies and 3) the major in history with secondary education certification. The department also offers a minor in history. It is strongly recommended that each student consult with a member of the history faculty to discuss which course of study would be best suited to further her or his educational needs and career goals. general Study Program This program of study is recommended for those students who want a thorough grounding in the discipline of history, exploring past as well as contemporary periods, Western as well as non-West - ern and regional cultural traditions, from a variety of historical perspectives. The major in history for general study is ideal for the student who would want to double major, using the history major to support work in such related fields as political science, economics, art history, English, religion, philosophy, communication arts, journalism, or sociology and anthropology. The major in history for general study requires a minimum of 24 credits in history at the 200 level or above; 6 credits must be at the 300 level; the student must also complete the HIST 470 Seminar. A maximum of 60 credits is allowed. History 470 Seminar is offered every semester, rotating among faculty members and area special - ties. Students may take HIST 470 more than once and receive credits toward the major and graduation provided the seminars are on different topics. Check with the history department for seminar scheduling. To ensure a solid background and broad perspective in history, students who pursue the major in history for general study must select introductory courses from each of the three following groups: premodern history, American history and international/non-Western/regional history. In addi - tion, all students must take one course in Topics in American History. It is strongly recommended that students begin their study with the introductory courses before proceeding to intermediate or more advanced work in the discipline. Consult with your adviser or a member of the history faculty for guidance on course selection. Cognate fields: Along with the history major, students are encouraged to select a group of courses in cognate fields such as English, economics, political science, philosophy, sociology or religion. See the department for the complete list. languages: Students are strongly recommended to have proficiency in a foreign language. 110 HIStoRY MaJoRIntroductory Courses (9 credits) one course from each of the following groups: Premodern History (one course): HIST 200 The Ancient World HIST 202 Medieval Europe HIST 203 Renaissance and Reformation Europe HIST 204 Ancient Rome american History (one course): HIST 217 History of the United States to 1865 HIST 218 History of the United States since 1865 International/non-Western/Regional History (one course): HIST 234 History of Modern Russia HIST 237 Modern China and Japan HIST 238 Contemporary Southeast Asia HIST 242 The Middle East in Modern Times HIST 246 Introduction to Africa HIST 247 Europe From 1900 to 1939 HIST 248 Europe Since 1939 HIST 299 Special Topics: The World since 1945 HIST 309 Islam and the Crusades topics in american History (3 credits) one course from the following group: HIST 210 Women in 20th-Century America HIST 225 Civil War/Reconstruction AFHS 250 African-American History to the 20th Century AFHS 251 African-American History during the 20th Century HIST 310 History of Women in the United States HIST 320 America in the Sixties HIST 321 Hollywood's America HIST 325 U.S. Social History, 1700-2000 HIST 328 20th-Century America HIST 353 United States Diplomatic History: America in Vietnam from Truman to Nixon AFHS 424 Race and Racism in the United States Upper level Courses (6 credits) 6 credits in any history area at the 300 level or above. Seminar (3 credits) HIST 470 Seminar HIStoRY MaJoR 111Preparation for graduate School and Professional Studies option This program of study is designed for those students who either already have defined career ambitions or who in the course of their education at Hood, may discover a deepening of interests and desire to pursue further study beyond the college level in history or related professional fields. Students should recognize that the entrance requirements of many graduate and professional schools, as well as certain employment opportunities, may exceed those of the history major for general study. So, a more focused program of study may be desirable. The student can choose a pattern of courses in close consultation with a departmental adviser to develop more particular expertise in an area of interest that might better serve her or his goals. This option for the major in history consists of a minimum of 36 credits in history at the 200 level or above; 12 credits must be at the 300 level; the student must also complete HIST 470 Seminar. (A maximum of 60 credits is allowed.) The student must distribute courses and choose a concentration as discussed below. In addition, students who elect this history major must take four courses in cognate fields of study, one which must be at the 300 level. Cognate fields include: English, economics, political science, philosophy, religion and sociology, among others. distribution of Courses and area Concentrations in graduate School and Professional Studies option All majors in history in preparation for graduate school and professional studies must distribute one introductory level course and one upper-level course from each of the following groups: premodern history, American history, international/non-Western/regional history. In addition, the student must choose to concentrate in one of the three areas: premodern, American, interna - tional/non-Western/regional, or to develop an individualized concentration in consultation with the adviser and the approval of the department. In thinking about a concentration, the student should work closely with the faculty adviser to choose a pattern of courses suited to her or his interests and goals. The student would usually complete HIST 470 Seminar in the area specialty of the concentration or in the area of historical theory and methodology. languages: Students are strongly encouraged to have proficiency in foreign languages. Students are encouraged to complete the College foreign language requirement early in their careers at Hood. Students who major in history are advised that certain areas of history and other related fields of study may require more advanced proficiency in foreign languages. Consult with a mem - ber of this history faculty for guidance on language study. Secondary education Certification History majors also may wish to obtain certification to teach history at the secondary level.

HonoRS PRogRaM The Hood College Honors Program is a four-year program of coursework, co-curricular events and extracurricular activities. Academically exceptional first-year students and transfer students are encouraged to apply to the program. Honors courses, which are designed to cultivate students' ability to examine our complex world, are interdisciplinary in approach and are often team- taught. Classes are small, discussion-oriented and enhanced by guest speakers and field trips. the Honors Program includes the following requirements: 6 credits of Honors coursework during first year. 6 credits of Honors coursework during sophomore year. 9 additional credits of Honors coursework during sophomore, junior and senior years. 1 104-level foreign language course (or exemption). First Year Honors experience First-year students in the Honors Program take two Colloquium courses organized around inter - disciplinary themes. In the first semester (HON 101) the course emphasizes the humanities and social sciences. The second semester (HON 102) explores a theme related to the natural sciences. Sophomore Year Honors experience The sophomore year in Honors (HON 201 and HON 202) helps students to explore the nature of knowledge, cultural differences and the individual's place in society. During the second semes - ter (HON 202) students combine scholarly research with experiential learning. By invitation, selected Hood students may begin the program at the sophomore level. These students are exempt from HON 101 and HON 102. HonoRS PRogRaM 113Junior and Senior Years Students in the Honors program will complete two 300-level electives and HON 470, Seminar in Honors. Students who study abroad for at least one semester may count that experience as one of their honors electives. Students who complete a two-semester Departmental Honors Paper (499) may count that as one of their Honors electives. Honors students may begin taking their electives in the sophomore year. Because Honors electives are offered on an irregular schedule, students who are especially interested in a particular elective are urged to take it the first time it is offered during their eligible years. Honors Program thesis As an alternative to a Departmental Honors Thesis, students in Hood's Honors Program may elect to complete a 3-credit interdisciplinary paper or project (HON 499) during the fall or spring semester of the senior year. Relationship to the Core Curriculum Most Honors courses may be used to meet Core Curriculum requirements. First-year students and sophomores may apply up to 9 credits toward the 21-23 credits required in the Methods of Inquiry section of the Core Curriculum. (There is a 3-credit limit for any one category. No Hon - ors credit may be applied to the laboratory science requirement. Honors credit may be applied to only one of the Aesthetic Appreciation requirements.) Most Honors elective courses satisfy requirements in the Civilization section of the Core. Foreign language Requirement All students in the Honors Program must meet the 104-level foreign language course require - ment. Students for whom English is a second language should consult with the Honors Director to determine possible exemption from this requirement. transferring into the Honors Program The Honors Program welcomes qualified transfer students. Those who have successfully com - pleted two years of an honors program at another college before they transfer to Hood may apply to the Hood College Honors Program at the junior level without having to complete the first-year and sophomore Honors courses at Hood. Such students must take a minimum of 9 credits in Honors Program courses (two electives and HON 470) in order to complete the program. Students who transfer to Hood in their sophomore year, or students who transfer in their junior year without having completed two years of an honors program at another college, may also apply to the Honors Program. They must take a minimum of 14 credits in Honors Program courses (usually HON 201, HON 202, two electives and HON 470). Sophomore transfers who com - plete HON 201 and HON 202 may exempt two courses from the Methods of Inquiry section of the Core (not a lab science and no more than one course in Aesthetic Appreciation). Transfer students should be aware of the Honors Program Foreign Language Requirement (see above). Recognition of Honors Students To graduate from the Honors Program, students must earn a C- or better in all Honors courses and maintain a cumulative G.P.A. of 3.25. By doing so, and meeting the Honors Program re - quirements, they will earn Honors Program recognition on their academic records. latIn aMeRICan StUdIeS MaJoR, b.a. director: Maria Griselda Zuffi The Latin American Studies major is a multidisciplinary program that has a long tradition in universities throughout the U.S. Students who are interested in democracy and culture, human rights, international affairs, literature and languages, and wish to explore from different perspec - tives the diverse regions of Latin America and the Caribbean should consider this academic pro - gram. Students will be prepared to work at international, governmental and private organizations dealing with the region or to continue graduate studies in the field. 114 HonoRS PRogRaMGiven the proximity to the Washington, D.C., area, many students have internships at various associations, centers and organizations dedicated to the region. Students who are interested in issues involving the U.S. Latino communities may consider working in outreach programs in Maryland or Washington, D.C. The Latin American Studies program sponsors many events and invites writers, activists, policy makers and film critics to enhance the knowledge and experience of the students in the program. A number of summer grants are available for students who intend to undertake research projects in a Latin American country. The major consists of 33 credits, 15 of which are required and provide a strong background in literature and culture from the colonial era to the present. For these foundational courses, competency in Spanish is necessary. Students may consider taking courses in English while taking intermediate language courses if they do not meet the competency level required (at or above the 200 level). Students are required to study abroad at least one semester at a Latin American uni - versity. Through Hood's educational exchange programs, students have the opportunity to study in Chile, the Dominican Republic and Peru. Students should plan their studies with the program director before going abroad.

Coordinator: Janis Judson The law and society major integrates course work from sociology, political science and phi - losophy. It helps students understand, from a variety of perspectives, how an individual's life is influenced by laws and how social institutions are created and regulated by law. This program gives students a liberal arts education while preparing them for law-related careers in such areas as court services, corrections, advocacy groups, law enforcement, civil rights organi - zations, regulatory agencies and women's rights groups, as well as state, local and federal govern - ment. Majors may also enter law school or related graduate programs in areas such as justice studies, criminology and public policy. An internship, usually during the junior or senior year, is recommended strongly. Recent intern - ship sites include congressional offices, affirmative action programs, juvenile courts, judges' offices, law firms, the U.S. Attorney's Office, prisons, consumer action agencies, city and state legislative offices and women's advocacy organizations.

The management program is designed to prepare students for leadership careers in complex organizations in the public, private and nonprofit sectors of an increasingly global economy and diversified workplace. Our differentiating niche is a strong emphasis on business functions, social accountability, global awareness, quantitative and qualitative analytical skills, and synergy between theory and practice. Because tomorrow's managers will face intense competitive pressures and strong demands for competency, flexibility and accountability, the management program provides a curriculum that builds core competencies and embeds that core curriculum in a liberal arts program. The management faculty members, who are active in teaching, scholarship and mentoring, aim to create a collaborative teaching and learning environment. Majors are required to participate in our lecture series and to spend either a semester, year or summer studying abroad or in an internship in a major international city such as Washington, D.C. (International students are exempt from the study abroad and internship requirement.) Majors are also encouraged to work with a faculty member in management on at least one research project. Common body of Knowledge Management Core Management students are expected to have the following competencies: knowledge about the different functional areas of business, quantitative and qualitative analytical skills, and the ability to relate organizations to the greater society in which they exist. The Management Core, which consists of 15 courses, enables students to achieve these competencies. Every management major has to fulfill the management core requirement. The courses denoted with an asterisk (*) must be taken at Hood. Requirements for the Major all majors must take the following management courses (33 credits): MGMT 205 Principles of Management MGMT 281 Principles of Financial Accounting MGMT 284 Principles of Managerial Accounting MGMT 301 Organizational Behavior and Industrial Relations* ECMG 303 Principles of Finance and Investment* MGMT 306 Principles of Marketing MGMT Management* MGMT 314 International Business* ITMG 388 Management 411 Seminar in Strategic Management* MGMT 454 Legal Environment of Business all majors must also take the following courses (10-12 credits): ECON 200 Principles of Economics or ECON 205 Principles of Macroeconomics and ECON 206 Principles of Microeconomics ECMG 212 Statistics for Economics and Management or MATH 112 Applied Statistics ECON 306 Microeconomic Analysis Majors are also required to participate in a study abroad semester, year or summer or an internship (MgMt 399\u20143 credits).

MatHeMatICS MaJoR, b.a. The field of mathematics offers a variety of excellent career opportunities. The Department offers both a major and a minor in mathematics; mathematics majors may also earn secondary teaching certification. Mathematics courses at Hood are taught with an emphasis on student participation, active learning, collaboration and the use of technology. Students at Hood work closely with faculty members. Classes are small, and students can explore topics that interest them. The senior semi - nar, in the history of mathematics, is student-organized and student-run. The Department has a computer laboratory dedicated to mathematics classes, with computational and graphics software to support the mathematics curriculum. 118 MatHeMatICS MaJoRClassrooms, labs, seminar rooms and informal spaces in the Hodson Science and Technology Center provide attractive and useful facilities for student-faculty interaction. Math students are among the most active and involved on campus. They are leaders in student government and in residential and commuter student groups. Members of the math club organize field trips to the Smithsonian, the Maryland Science Center and to the National Cryptologic Mu - seum. Math students participate in the annual national competition in mathematical modeling, attend conferences and give presentations, are members of professional organizations, complete exciting internships in Washington D.C., and Baltimore and enter graduate school or the work force with valuable skills. Requirements for the Major the mathematics major is composed of the following courses: CS 284 Computer Science I MATH 112 Applied Statistics MATH 201-203 Calculus I, II, III MATH 207 Discrete Mathematics MATH 304 Differential Equations or MATH 351 Probability and Statistics MATH 320 Modeling and Simulation or MATH 456 Numerical Analysis MATH 333 Introduction to Abstract Mathematics MATH 339 Linear Algebra MATH 440 Introduction to Abstract Algebra MATH 453 Introduction to Real Analysis MATH 470 Seminar: The History of Mathematics The mathematics major can be combined with other disciplines (such as biology, chemistry, economics or management) in a double-major program; this option is particularly useful for those interested in the use of quantitative methods in the other discipline. The mathematics major also can complement study in another discipline that is less directly related to it; the broader a student's background, the more choices and opportunities are available. Secondary education Certification Mathematics majors may wish to obtain certification to teach mathematics at the secondary level. Students who complete the secondary education program receive certification to teach in Mary - land upon graduation, along with reciprocity for teaching in certain other states. Students must complete the requirements for the mathematics major plus the following mathematics courses: MATH 320 Modeling and Simulation MATH 304 Differential Equations MATH 335 Teaching Assistantship in Mathematics, 3 credits, at least one of which must be associated with a 100- or 200-level course in the Department of Mathematics MATH 336 Introduction to Modern Geometry In addition, students must meet the requirements specified under Education, Secondary Educa - tion Certification.

The philosophy major introduces students to the major figures and important issues in the world's philosophical traditions. The Department of Religion and Philosophy recognizes that the fields of philosophy and religious studies, although distinct, nonetheless share many concerns and approaches, and often address the same issues. Consequently, departmental faculty strongly recommend that students with philoso - phy majors and minors also take religion courses. MUSIC MaJoR 121Requirements for the Major The major requires a minimum of 27 credits in philosophy at the 200 level or above, including the following philosophy courses: PHIL 200 Contemporary Philosophical Topics or PLWS 203 Philosophical Issues in Feminism PHIL 207 Logic PHIL 221 Ethics PLRL 301 Indian Thought or PLRL 306 Chinese Thought PHIL 307 History of Philosophy I: The Ancient World to the Renaissance PHIL 308 History of Philosophy II: The Early Modern Era to the Twentieth Century PLRL 470 Seminar two electives INPL 309 Biomedical Ethics, REL 304 Islam, and REL 314 Modern Christian Thought will count as philosophy electives within the 27-credit minimum required for the philosophy major. Department faculty urge students who wish to pursue graduate study in philosophy to take more than the minimum number of hours required to complete a major. although the courses listed below may not be counted as electives within the philosophy major or minor, the philosophy faculty commend them to students as worthy comple - ments to their philosophy courses: AFPS 353 Contemporary African Political Thought AFPS 355 African-American Political Thought AFAM 470 African-American Feminist Thought ART 350 Classical Art and Archaeology HIST 200 The Ancient World HON 315 Literature of Moral Reflection PSCI 333 Modern Political Thought PSCI 337 Theories of Democracy PolItICal SCIenCe MaJoR, b.a. A major in political science prepares students for a wide variety of careers in the public or private sectors, such as law; public administration at local, state or federal levels; or community advocacy. Combined with study in related disciplines, the political science major is a strong liberal arts program. It also is suitable for a double major combined with economics, history, management or a similar discipline. The political science courses cover four areas in the discipline: U.S. politics and policy, compara - tive politics and international relations, law and political theory. Students are encouraged to take courses in each of these concentrations. Students who plan to do graduate work in political science or public administration should take courses at the 300 and 400 level in as many of these concentrations as possible. In addition, they are encouraged to take statistics and economics in preparation for graduate study. Students interested in careers in public service or international relations are strongly encouraged to develop proficiency in at least one foreign language. Those who plan to enter law school should work closely with the College's pre-law advisers and should also take courses in economics and logic to improve their research and writing skills. Internships are recommended and are available at local, state and federal levels. Because of Hood's location near Washington, D.C., and within reach of the state capital, students have an unparal - leled opportunity to observe firsthand the workings of government. Hood cooperates with the Washington Semester Program at American University. The department also provides students with a number of opportunities to participate in simulations of political processes, including simulations of the European Union, the Maryland legislature and the United Nations. Political science faculty serve as advisers for these activities. The political science major provides students with an introduction to decision making at various levels of government, an understanding of public policy formation and of the correlation between 122 PolItICal SCIenCe MaJoRpolitical and economic problems. It also provides experience in research and access to computer facilities both at the College and the Library of Congress, an exposure to the practical world of politics and an appreciation of the need for good writing skills. Requirements for the Major The major in political science requires 36 credits of political science courses at the 200 level or above, including the following: PSCI 203 Introduction to U.S. Politics PSCI 205 Methods of Political Inquiry PSCI 210 Comparative Politics PSCI 303 Public Policy Analysis PSCI 333 Modern Political Thought PSCI 470 Seminar on Politics Students are required to take one of the following courses: PSCI 202 Women and Politics PSCI 336 Gender and the Law AFPS 240 African-American Politics HSPS 245 Global Perspectives on Women, Power and Politics It is recommended that political science majors take ECON 205 Principles of Macroeconomics. In addition, competency in a foreign language is recommended. 15 additional credits in political science are required for the completion of the major. PRe-PRoFeSSIonal PRePaRatIon Pre-law Studies Although there is no specific pre-law curriculum, a strong foundation in the liberal arts, with em - phasis on such subjects as English language and literature, political science, sociology, philosophy and logic, history or economics is highly recommended. Virtually all law schools require the Law School Admission Test for admission. Students intend - ing to go to law school directly after graduation should visit the Career Center to receive assis - tance with program planning and with the law school application process. Pre-Medical and Pre-dental Studies Medical schools prefer students who have a broad background in the humanities and social sci - ences. The following courses, specified in the Medical School Admissions Requirements, are most often the minimum required by professional schools in the United States and Canada. These courses should be completed by the end of the junior year. BIOL 8 credits of biology at the 200 level (BIOL 202 and BIOL 203 are recommended) CHEM 101 and 102 General Chemistry I and II CHEM 209 and 210 Organic Chemistry I and II ENGL 100, 101 or 110-139 English composition course, plus another semester of a writing-intensive course PHYS 101 and 102 General Physics (requires MATH 120) or PHYS 203 and 204 Introductory Physics I and II (requires calculus) The courses listed below are strongly recommended, but not strictly required, by professional schools. These courses are also best completed by the end of the junior year in order to prepare for the Medical College Admission Test or the Dental Admission Test. Each student should decide, in consultation with a member of Hood's Health Professions Advisory Committee, whether or not to take additional science courses. PRe-PRoFeSSIonal PRePaRatIon 123BIOL 307 Human Anatomy and Physiology I BIOL 316 Genetics BIOL 331 Microbiology BIOL 339 Cell Biology CHEM 301 Biological Chemistry I Most schools require a year of English, some require calculus and many encourage the study of philosophy or ethics. Hood's Health Professions Advisory Committee members not only provide advice on preparation for medical, dental and veterinary schools, but also write composite letters of recommendation to accompany an eligible student's applications. Students considering graduate school in one of the health professions should register with the Catherine Filene Shouse Career Center. Although biology, biochemistry and chemistry are the majors most often chosen, the student may major in any area. In any case, the student must earn a competitive grade point average (3.5 or higher is typical of successful candidates) and must show proficiency in the sciences. The selection of courses and choice of major should be discussed with the Health Professions Adviser or a mem - ber of the Health Professions Advisory Committee early in the student's program. The MCAT and DAT tests are given throughout the year. The appropriate test should be taken in the spring or early summer of the junior year after the student has had the minimum science courses listed above. Five important factors in being admitted to medical or dental school are: 1. the undergraduate cumulative average; 2. the results of the Medical College Admission Test or Dental Admission Test; 3. evaluations from Hood faculty and the Health Professions Advisory Committee; 4. a personal interview, if the professional school requests it; 5. off-campus experience in community service or in health professions activities. For more information, please feel free to talk with the Health Professions Adviser or any member of the Health Professions Advisory Committee. Pre-veterinary Studies Admission into a veterinary school is among the most difficult of any post-baccalaureate program. Veterinary medical schools require students to be prepared with a strong grounding in the sci - ences (in particular biochemistry, chemistry and microbiology) balanced by coursework in the humanities, social sciences and mathematics. In addition to demonstrating exceptional ability in the classroom, most veterinary schools also ex - pect students to have had hands-on experience under the tutelage of an experienced veterinarian. Students interested in entering the veterinary profession should contact the Health Professions Advisory Committee and the Career Center for information about the application process and veterinary schools. PSYCHologY MaJoR, b.a. The major in psychology covers aspects of human and animal behavior ranging from the firing of a single neuron to the death and dying process. Psychology can prepare students for various entry-level jobs in social services, mental health, management or almost any area that requires a broad liberal arts education. The psychology major also can be the basis for admission to graduate or professional training in psychology, medicine, law and other areas, limited only by the careful selection of elective courses. Opportunities exist for internships and in the past students have worked with hospitalized children, adolescents and adults in outpatient treatment facilities and community mental health agencies; and at the Maryland School for the Deaf, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Mental Health, The Johns Hopkins University Hospital and the American Psychological Association. 124 PSYCHologY MaJoRgeneral Requirements PSY 101 Introduction to Psychology PSY 211 Elementary Statistics PSY 212 Survey of Psychological Research PSY 441 History and Theories of Psychology distribution and depth Requirements distribution: Select one asterisked (*) course from each group listed below. depth: Take at least two additional courses from one of the groups listed below, beyond the distribution requirement. group I experimental PSY 213 Experimental Psychology* PSY 409 Psychology of Learning, Memory and Cognition PSY 418 Physiological Psychology PSY 419 Psychopharmacology group II Social/organizational PSY 203 Survey of Clinical, Community, and Counseling Psychology PSY 205 Social Psychology* PYSO 221 Social Gerontology PSY 239 Human Development II: Adulthood and Aging PSY 434 Tests and Measurements group III Personality/Clinical PSY 203 Survey of Clinical, Community, and Counseling Psychology PSY 401 Theories of Personality* PSY 431 Abnormal Psychology* PSY 434 Tests and Measurements PSY 456 Behavior Modification group Iv developmental PSY 204 Psychology of Death PSY 206 Psychology of Women PSY 208 Psychology of Adolescence PYSO 221 Social Gerontology PSY 237 Human Development I: Childhood and Adolescence* PSY 238 Human Development II: Adulthood and Aging* AFPY 270 African-American Psychological Perspectives PSY 373 Psychology of Aging RelIgIon MaJoR, b.a. The religion major acquaints students with the world's major religious traditions and helps stu - dents develop a critical understanding of the issues involved in the academic study of religion. The Department of Religion and Philosophy recognizes that the fields of philosophy and religious studies, although distinct, nonetheless share many concerns and approaches, and they often ad - dress the same issues. Consequently, departmental faculty strongly recommend that students with religion majors and minors avail themselves of opportunities to enroll in philosophy courses. Requirements for the Major the major requires a minimum of 27 credits in religion at the 200 level or above, and must include the following religion courses: REL 203 Old Testament REL 204 New Testament REL 211 American Religious History PLRL 301 Indian Thought or PLRL 306 Chinese Thought REL 412 Myth, Symbol and Ritual PLRL 470 Seminar RelIgIon MaJoR 125three electives, including at least two at the 300 level HIST 406 Religion, Family and Society in Reformation Europe; PHIL 307 History of Philoso - phy I: The Ancient World to the Renaissance; PHIL 308 History of Philosophy II: The Early Modern Era to the 20th Century; and PHIL 314 The American Intellectual Tradition may count as electives in the 27-credit minimum required for the religion major. Department faculty urge students who intend to pursue a higher degree in religious studies to take more than the minimum number of hours required to complete an undergraduate major. although the courses listed below may not be counted as electives within the religion major or minor, the religion faculty commend them to students as worthy complements to their religion courses: ART 201 Meaning and Method in Art ART 220 History of Art I ART 221 History of Art II ART 308 Myths, Saints, and Symbols ART 351 Medieval Art CL 202 Mythology CL 302 Classical Mythology HON 308 Dante and Giotto SoCIal WoRK MaJoR, b.a. director: Joy Swanson Ernst The social work program is accredited for undergraduate social work education by the Council on Social Work Education. The social work major, based on a foundation in the liberal arts, provides professional preparation for employment in social work, social services and other fields of human service. Graduates are prepared for generalist social work practice, useful in a variety of practice settings, including child welfare, corrections, services to older adults, community organization, mental health, family services and health services. Beyond the liberal arts core, students majoring in social work must complete courses in four basic sequences: human behavior and the social environment, social research, social policy and social service institutions and social work methods. Particularly important is the field practicum during senior year, where students apply social work theories of practice and research in one of a variety of settings. Specific practice settings vary each year, but may include child welfare or adult care in county departments of social service, crisis care for abused women and children, family preserva - tion services in private agencies, group care for middle school and high school age youth, school social work services, nursing homes and assisted living centers and residential and traditional mental health services. The choice of field setting is tailored to interests and learning needs of in - dividual students. Often the field experience leads to employment upon graduation. In addition, successful completion of the undergraduate degree may result in advanced standing for graduate social work studies. The College does not award credit through portfolio evaluation for social work courses. The pro - gram actively subscribes to Hood's policies regarding nondiscrimination and affirmative action. Requirements for the Major The social work major requires foundation courses from a number of different liberal arts disci - plines plus specialized social work courses, including one elective in social work and one from the list of recommended electives in a social or behavioral science. Many of the foundation courses meet Core Curriculum requirements. (Note: The Council on Social Work Education requires one semester of human biology, which is fulfilled at Hood with BIOL 132. Coursework completed at other colleges will satisfy this requirement only if exclusively devoted to human biology.) 126 SoCIal WoRK MaJoRFoundation Courses ANTH 201 Introduction to Anthropology BIOL 132 Biology of Aging ECON 205 Principles Macroeconomics or ECON 206 Principles of Microeconomics PYSO 221 Social Gerontology SOC 101 Principles of Sociology SOC 215 Social Problems SOC 260 The Philosophy and Methods of Social Research SOC 261 Social Statistics SOC 323 Ethnicity in America Social Work Courses SOWK 201 Introduction to Social Work and the Human Services SOWK 301 Social Policy and Human Service Programs SOWK 342 Social Work Methods I SOWK 343 Human Behavior and the Social Environment I SOWK 344 Human Behavior and the Social Environment II SOWK 442 Social Work Methods II SOWK 445A, B Social Work Field Practice SOWK 446A, B Social Work Field Practice SOWK 452 Seminar on the Social Work Profession Social Work electives SOWK 214 Child Welfare: Policies and Services SOSW 217 Juvenile Delinquency SOWK 330 Social Work with Families SOWK 333 The Fields of Social Service Recommended electives PSY 204 Psychology of Death PSY 208 Psychology of Adolescence PSY 238 Human Development II: Adulthood and Aging PSY 373 Psychology of Aging PSY 431 Abnormal Psychology SOC 216 Criminology SOC 300 Social Inequality SOC 311 Sociology of Gender SOC 353 Deviance and Social Control Screening for Social Work Major Students wishing to major in social work must apply for and be accepted into the program in order to formally declare the major.

Sociology is the study of social life and the social forces that shape human experience. Students who major in sociology are prepared for a wide range of careers in areas such as social action, social research, human services and administration in government agencies, schools, businesses, nonprofit organizations and social agencies. Many sociology majors continue their education and pursue professions such as city and community planning, research, politics, social policy, adminis - tration, criminology, law, social work and higher education. The sociology major provides a strong foundation in sociological theory and research skills. Students also may take elective courses in a variety of more specialized subjects, such as social problems, gender, social inequality, ethnicity and criminology. Many sociology majors undertake an internship or independent study as part of their program. Students have received credit for internships in government agencies, courts, law firms, politi - cal campaigns, women's organizations, school systems, group homes for delinquents, research firms and health care agencies. Internships are individually arranged for students with specialized interests and career plans. Requirements for the Major The sociology major requires a minimum of 27 and a maximum of 60 credits in sociology. the following sociology courses are required: SOC 101 Principles of Sociology SOC 259 Sociological Theory SOC 260 The Philosophy and Methods of Social Research SOC 261 Social Statistics SOC 470 Seminar in Sociology SOC 472 Advanced Methods of Social Research SOC 482 Practicum in Social Research to complete the requirements, students may select from among a number of different elective courses in sociology.

The purposes of the program of minors are as follows: n To provide opportunities for students to pursue in a focused and integrated manner programs of study not currently available as majors; n To use existing resources to provide distinctive and challenging curricular opportunities; n To provide an alternative to double majors for students who wish to pursue more than one program of study. n To integrate further the liberal arts and career preparation through opportunities to combine a liberal arts major with a career-related minor or a career-related major with a liberal arts minor; and n To enable graduates to prepare for careers or further study in more than one area of concen - trated knowledge. The grouping of courses in a minor may be identical to a concentration. However, a concen - tration is elected by students within a major, while a minor is elected by students majoring in another field. The minor consists of a minimum of 15 credits of course work, forming a coherent program relating to a specific academic objective. Students are allowed to have two majors and a single minor, or a major and two minor fields. Minors are not required of students. the following are requirements for a minor: n A minimum of 12 credits in the minor must be taken outside the student's major and may not overlap with the major. If there is additional overlap, the credit must count in the major. The course may be used to fulfill a requirement in the minor, but the credit may count only in the major. n If a student elects a second minor, a minimum of 12 credits must be taken outside the first minor. Courses may be used to fulfill requirements in both minors, but the credit may count only in one minor. n Students must have a Grade Point Average of 2.0 and a minimum of 9 credits completed at 130 MInoRSHood College for the minor to be listed on the academic record. n A maximum of 21 credits may be counted in the minor. n Courses counted in the minor may also count in the Core. n Declarations of a minor occur during the spring semester of the junior year when students submit the graduation audit, listing their intended minor field, to the Registrar's Office. n Students may develop their own minor, with the approval of the department or departments that are teaching those classes relative to the student's proposed minor and of the Committee on Academic Standards and Policies, provided they meet the minimum number of credits and course levels required of minors. aFRICan-aMeRICan StUdIeS MInoR (18 credits) Coordinators: Tamelyn Tucker-Worgs, Hoda Zaki The African-American Studies program, an interdisciplinary minor of 18 credits, is designed to prepare students for graduate study in this and related areas.

The 18-credit under - graduate minor may be used to supplement a number of majors, including biology, economics, management, psychology, social work and sociology. The minor provides specialization in the study of the older adult and aging population; the aging process; the special needs of this segment of the population; the skills required to work effectively with the older adult and the elderly; and the economic, political, clinical and social issues surrounding the increasingly larger proportion of aged individuals in the American society. By supplementing a major with the gerontology minor, students will be better prepared for careers as project planners, counselors for families caring for the elderly, instructors for adult education programs, grief counselors, educators and others.

This should be cleared in advance with the pro - gram coordinator in order to ensure that it will fulfill credits toward the minor. A large number of today's elderly live in urban areas and are Spanish speaking. Thus, students will benefit by having background in Spanish, particularly through SPAN 103. Gerontology students have many practicum sites available to them, including the National Coun - cil on Aging, the Maryland State Office on Aging, community commissions on aging, nursing facilities, adult day care centers, Hospice and many independent living facilities for the aging. global StUdIeS MInoR (15-16 credits) Coordinators: Paige Eager, Leonard Latkovski This interdisciplinary minor examines global cultural, economic, environmental, gender, social and political dynamics.

Conditional Admissions Policy Students with a minimum G.P.A. of 2.5 may be admitted conditionally to a specific gradu - ate program at the discretion of the program director. The program director will stipulate the conditions of admission, which may include registration in a specific course or courses, limiting the number of credits for enrollment and achieving a specified G.P.A. in this coursework. The program director will review the status of students admitted conditionally at the end of each semester. Students meeting the conditions specified in the conditional admissions letter can have their status changed to full program and graduate school admissions based on the recommenda - tion of the program director. International Students Aside from program specific requirements for admission, the following items are necessary for international students applying for a student visa who intend to pursue any graduate degree program: 1. Complete the online application for graduate admission at www.hood.edu/graduate 2. Request an official score report from Educational Testing Service (ETS) of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) to be sent to the Hood College Graduate School. The Hood College school code is 5296. The admission requirements for TOEFL scoring are: n A minimum cumulative TOEFL score of 89 Internet-based scale or 231 computer-based scale. n A minimum TOEFL score of 16 Internet-based scale or 18 computer-based scale on each section. n A score equal to/greater than 4.0 on the essay rating. n TOEFL scores are valid for two years. Any student whose native language is English and/or who has completed a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution in the United States, or from an American school abroad, may be waived from the TOEFL requirement for admission. Any additional requests for a waiver of the TOEFL score must be made in writing to the attention of the appropriate program direc - tor. 3. Submit official international college transcripts. International transcripts must be evaluated by a certified organization. Students must request a professional course-by-course evaluation of the international transcripts, including courses taken, grades earned, degrees awarded and grade point average. The official letter of evaluation serves to replace official copies of the student's transcript. We will not review any international transcripts that have not been evaluated. Hood College usually works with World Education Services (www.wes.org) for transcript evaluations. However, the College will accept evaluations from any member of the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services. For a list of all approved certified organizations, their fees and requirements, please visit www.naces.org. 4. Complete the I-20 Application form. International applicants must arrange for financial sup - port from their governments, from international organizations or from personal and family resources. The estimated cost for one year of graduate study at Hood College is approximately $22,000 in U.S. funds. This includes tuition, fees, books, lodging, food, clothing, transporta - tion and incidental expenses. As part of the I-20 application students must submit an affidavit of support which includes official financial statements. Hood College will accept the following financial documents: n Original bank statements, not older than 12 months, verifying the account balances (U.S. or foreign banks), showing funds in U.S. dollars. Photocopies will not be accepted. GRADUATE ADMISSION 267268 GRADUATE ADMISSION n Original letters, not older than 12 months, from bank officials written in English on bank letterhead verifying the account holder, account number and current balance in U.S. dollars.

Upon admission to the Hood College Graduate School, completed I-20 applications and all supplemental financial documents will be forwarded to the director of multicultural affairs for processing. International students with student visas must pursue nine hours of credit each semes - ter (fall and spring) to be considered full-time graduate students. It is incumbent upon all students to understand that the academic standards of the graduate programs at Hood College are applied equally to all students without regard to written, oral or semantic capabilities in English. Thus, all prospective students should consider their competency in English with care. The Director of Multicultural Affairs offers support services and programs to help students with personal and practical concerns. Resident Aliens and Other Visa Statuses Students who are not citizens of the United States will be required to submit a copy of their Resident Alien card or current visa before registering for any coursework. English as a Second Language Academic Services offers an English as a Second Language (ESL) course for non-native speakers. The course ENGL 100 focuses primarily on advanced-level academic writing and therefore is most suitable for students able to carry a full-time course load while simultaneously enhancing English composition skills. Please contact the Office of Academic Services at (301) 696-3569 for information about the ESL course. Housing The College does not provide housing for graduate students. All graduate students must make arrangements for their own housing. Generally, housing is available in the area. Visiting Graduate Students Holding the Ph.D. Persons holding the Ph.D. degree and wishing to take graduate courses must follow the complete application and registration procedure. However, a letter from the student's employer acknowl - edging that the visiting student holds the Ph.D. degree will be accepted in lieu of transcripts as part of the application procedure. Those individuals who wish to pursue a master's degree or certificate program must submit official transcripts. Enrolled at Other Graduate Institutions Some students who are enrolled at other graduate institutions may wish to take one or more graduate courses at Hood College. Those students must follow the complete application and registration procedure. However, in lieu of transcripts and as part of the application procedure, a letter from the student's adviser (or the dean) of the sending institution will be accepted. Such a letter should indicate that the student is in good standing and that \"visiting student status\" is requested. This letter is valid for registration for one semester.

The Accounting Office can be reached at (301) 696-3607 or accounting@hood.edu. Family Tuition Plan Please see page 34 for information on the Family Tuition Plan. Financial Aid Information regarding student loans is available from the Office of Financial Aid, located on the third floor of the Joseph Henry Apple Academic Resource Center, and they can be reached by phone at (301) 696-3411 or by e-mail at finaid@hood.edu. In order to be eligible for federal loans, a student must be accepted for enrollment in a degree program, take a minimum of 3 cred - its each semester and be making normal progress toward a degree from Hood as described below. To apply for a federal loan, a student must complete both a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the Hood Graduate Financial Aid Application. International students, although not eligible for federal loans, may apply for loan assistance from private educational loan programs if they have a credit-worthy cosigner who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Additional information can be obtained by contacting the Office of Financial Aid. Some programs have contract funding to support graduate students. Students should inquire about this possibility with the appropriate program director. Students are expected to maintain a record of achievement that will enable them to complete a degree in a reasonable time period. Federal regulations require that students who are recipients of financial aid through federal Stafford Loans continue to make satisfactory progress toward degree requirements according to the standards set forth by the College. Graduate programs range from 30 to 36 credits with most beginning at the 36-credit level, and a 3.00 cumulative average is required to complete the degree. Students are considered to be mak - ing satisfactory progress toward degree completion for financial aid purposes by adhering to the schedule outlined on the next page. YEAR COMPLETED CREDITS EARNED CUMULATIVE G.P.A. Year One 12 2.75 Year Two 24 3.00 Year Three 36 3.00 Some students may not complete the degree in three calendar years, but the number of credits earned determine the year of standing. Also, these standards may not coincide exactly with the Graduate School standards. The timeframe allowed for the completion of a degree can be much longer, but it is divided into academic year increments for financial aid according to the schedule above. Veterans' Educational Benefits Hood College serves as a liaison and informational resource to veterans by providing Veterans Administration forms and certifying eligibility status. To initiate or continue benefits, veterans must contact the Registrar's Office, (301) 696-3616, at the beginning of each semester and com - ply with the policies and procedures established by the Registrar and the Veterans Administra - tion. Information and application forms may be obtained from the Registrar's Office located on the second floor of the Joseph Henry Apple Academic Resource Center. All students, including veterans, are required to pay the usual fees to the College at the time of registration.270 GRADUATE RESOURCESGRADUATE RESOURCES Beneficial-Hodson Library and Information Technology Center Please see page 7 for information on the Beneficial-Hodson Library and Information Technology Center.

GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES Policies and procedures for graduate studies at Hood College are intended to safeguard the integ - rity of the degree granted, to facilitate the student's progress toward the degree, and to prevent delays and misunderstandings. The student is responsible for being thoroughly familiar with all policies and procedures as well as the requirements of the degree program. This catalog should be consulted regularly. Students who have questions about requirements or procedures should consult their adviser or the Graduate School. Academic Standards Academic Conduct The Graduate School strives to maintain and enforce the highest standards of academic integrity. Accordingly, plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty are unacceptable and will result in disciplinary action. By accepting admission to the Graduate School, a student has also accepted to be governed by the stated regulations of academic conduct, and indicates a willingness to accept disciplinary action, if behavior is deemed to be in violation of those rules or in some way unacceptable or detrimental to Hood College. At the time of admission to graduate study, each student must sign a statement indicating his or her understanding of these regulations. Professed ignorance of what constitutes academic dishonesty does not excuse violations of these regulations. All Hood College graduate students are expected to comply with the following rules of academic conduct. n Examinations, Tests and Quizzes. During examinations, tests, quizzes, comprehensive examinations or other classroom work, no student shall give or receive aid in any way or form not authorized by the instructor. n Papers, Essays, Oral Presentations and Theses. Presenting oral or written work that is not the student's own (except as the instructor specifically approves) is dishonest. Any direct state - ment taken from other sources must be documented. Sources of information and of ideas or opinions not the student's own must be clearly indicated. Instructors may prescribe limitations on the sources to be used. n Projects and Reports. Unless otherwise directed, each student must do her or his own work, experiments, drawings and so forth, from her or his own observations. Students may work together provided that each member of the group understands the work being done, and pro - vided that the instructor does not prohibit group work. Violations of Academic Conduct When an instructor has evidence that a graduate student is not in compliance with these expecta - tions, it is the obligation of the instructor to bring it to the attention of the student and to evalu - ate the specific work as a zero. That zero is to be calculated into the final course grade. Instruc - tors also reserve the right to assign a final course grade of \"F\" to a student for cases of academic dishonesty. Students may appeal the action of the instructor by written petition to the Graduate Council through the dean of the Graduate School. The Graduate Council will investigate the appeal and render a decision, though this decision may be appealed to the dean of the Graduate School. In perceived cases of extreme academic dishonesty, an instructor or program director may request a review by the Graduate Council. The Graduate Council will hear statements from the instructor and/or program director, and then from the student under review. If, after hearing both sides of the case, the Graduate Council finds the student to be in extreme violation of the Academic Conduct code, they will recommend dismissal from the program. The final decision will rest with the Graduate Council, though the student may appeal the decision to the dean of the Graduate School. Academic Dismissal A student whose cumulative average is below B (3.0) after the completion of 15 credit hours within their degree program at Hood College will be dismissed from the College for academic reasons. Students who are dismissed from the College may not enroll in classes as a nondegree seeking student. For academic eligibility, if a course is repeated the initial grade is not included in the calculation. However, all courses are included in the cumulative grade point average. A student who has been found by the Graduate Council to be in extreme violation of the Gradu - ate School's regulations of academic conduct will also be dismissed from the program and from the College (see above). Academic Warning A student whose cumulative average is below B (3.0) after taking 9 credits within their degree program will be sent appropriate warning notices to alert them to their low grade average. For academic eligibility, if a course is repeated the initial grade is not included in the calculation. However, all grades are included in the cumulative grade point average. Degree Candidacy Admission to Degree Candidacy Upon successful completion of 12 graduate credits that meet departmental requirements in a de - gree program at Hood with a cumulative average of B (3.0) or higher, the student is formally rec - ognized as a degree candidate. At that time, the student must complete and submit the Master's Degree Candidacy Form (DCF) for approval. Degree candidacy notification letters are mailed to the students and DCF forms are available on our Web site at www.hood.edu/graduate. Students who have not submitted a degree candidacy form in accordance with the time limits specified in their degree candidacy notification letter will not be permitted to register. The form must be submitted to the Graduate School Office according to the established time limits. GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 271It is the student's responsibility to obtain signatures of the adviser and program director before the form is submitted to the Graduate School for approval by the Dean. Students who have received approval for transfer credit must complete the appropriate section on the degree candidacy form. Students who take courses after completing 12 graduate credits meeting departmental require - ments, and who do not complete the Master's Degree Candidacy Form, cannot be certain that such courses will meet or be accepted as degree requirements. Once a Master's Degree Candidacy Form has been signed it may be changed only upon written re - quest of the student, with the approval of the adviser, program director and the Dean of the Gradu - ate School. Forms for changing the Master's Degree Candidacy Form are available in the Graduate School Office and online at www.hood.edu/graduate Changes in degree candidacy must be filed with the Graduate School Office prior to the semester in which the student plans to take the proposed new course. The grade point average for degree candidacy is based on all courses in the degree program, all courses in the major discipline and all other graduate courses recognized as meeting the program requirements. A student with a cumulative average below B (3.0) after completion of 12 graduate credits at Hood is not in good standing and is not classified as a candidate for a graduate degree. Changing from Nondegree to Degree Status A student who wishes to change from nondegree status to a degree program must inform the Graduate School Office, in writing, of this intent. The student must submit any additional docu - ments required of the specific program of interest and have his or her file reviewed by the program director. Admission as a nondegree student does not guarantee admission to a degree program. A maximum of 12 credits taken by a nondegree student may apply to a degree program. Changing from One Degree Program to Another A student who wishes to transfer from one degree program to another, before they have com - pleted their degree candidacy form, must obtain written permission from the program director and forward it to the Graduate School. A student who, after completing a degree candidacy form, has been admitted to a master's degree program at Hood College and who wishes to transfer to another degree program at Hood, or to change the concentration or major, must submit a written petition to the dean of the Graduate School containing the reasons for the proposed transfer. The dean will consult with the appropriate department(s) before rendering any decisions. Credits earned in the original program may apply to the new program if, in the opinion of the dean, they are appropriate to the new degree. Academic performance in any and all graduate coursework will be considered in appeals to transfer between degree programs. Students who have failed to earn a degree after attempting a comprehensive examination twice-\u2014or after failing to complete satisfactorily a field work project, software project or thesis\u2014may not transfer credits earned in that program to another degree program. Second Master's Degree A student who has earned one master's degree from Hood College may earn a second master's degree upon satisfactory completion of the program requirements in a second graduate degree program. Up to six hours of graduate credit may be applied from the first master's degree pro - gram to the second one. The seven-year limitation and all other academic requirements will apply to the second program except that the second major or concentration must be different from the first major or concentration. Students planning to pursue a second degree must notify the Gradu - ate School in writing of their intent. Enrollment in Two Master's Degree Programs Graduate students may enroll in and pursue two master's degree programs simultaneously. In order to apply to a second degree program, the student must submit a request in writing to the Graduate School indicating his or her desire to pursue a second master's degree. Students must also provide a letter of recommendation from their current adviser. A cumulative graduate G.P.A. of 3.0 in the first degree program is required for any student requesting to pursue a second degree program. Also, a graduate student must successfully complete a minimum of 9 credits in his or her first degree program before requesting acceptance into a second master's degree program. 272 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 273Upon receipt of the request, the Graduate School will assemble a review packet for the program director of the second degree program. The review packet will contain copies of the student's request, undergraduate and graduate transcripts and the letter of acceptance to the graduate school. The program director can recommend acceptance, provisional acceptance or denial as a result of the review. The Graduate School will also contact the program director of the student's first degree program who, in conjunction with the student's adviser, will determine if there are any mitigating circumstances that the Graduate School should consider related to the student's request to pursue two graduate degrees simultaneously. The final decision of acceptance or denial resides with the dean of the Graduate School. The following guidelines apply to students pursuing two master's degree programs simultaneously: n The student must maintain a cumulative graduate G.P.A. of 3.0 in each degree program. Dis - missal from one degree program does not necessarily result in dismissal from the second degree program. n The student must successfully complete a minimum of 9 credits in his or her first degree pro - gram before requesting acceptance into a second master's degree program. n Up to six hours of graduate credit may be applied from the first master's degree program to the second one. If programs share additional course requirements, the student may be waived from completing the course in the second degree program but will have to replace the course with an appropriate course subject to the approval of the student's adviser and program director. n Degree completion will be calculated and handled separately for each degree program. All processes must be addressed separately for each program. This includes time limits, degree candidacy forms and petitions to graduate. n Pursuit of two master's degree programs will not be considered a justifiable excuse for request - ing an extension of the time limit for degree completion in any one program. n The student's transcript will note both degree programs. n Academic and financial holds apply to the student and not the degree program. For example, a financial hold placed on a student's records as a result of a payment issue for a course in one degree program can prevent the student from pursuing courses in the second degree program. n A student may not pursue more than two graduate degree programs simultaneously. Degree Requirements Faculty advisers, the program director, the dean of the Graduate School and the staff are avail - able to assist students. Procedures have been set up to check progress toward the degree. It is the student's responsibility, however, to know the requirements for her or his degree and to fulfill them. It is the student's responsibility to be thoroughly familiar with the academic policies and procedures, as outlined in this catalog. Academic Advisement Each degree-seeking student is assigned to an adviser who: 1) evaluates any coursework taken else - where and proposed for transfer to a Hood graduate program, 2) assists the student in developing a concentration, 3) presents the student's application for candidacy to the dean of the Graduate School and 4) in some instances, supervises thesis or field work if such an option is selected. Comprehensive Examinations Comprehensive examinations are built upon the content of the graduate courses taken as components of a graduate program and upon courses for which a waiver or exemption has been granted. A student may not be examined in an area where transfer credit has been awarded. While many or most of the examination questions may deal with specific subject content, some may require the student to draw together several concepts in order to demonstrate an understanding of interrelated ideas. The Notification of Intent to take the Comprehensive Examination is mailed to degree candidates in applicable degree programs in August and February and includes the upcoming fall and spring examination dates. Only students who are in good standing (maintain - ing a 3.0 cumulative grade point average) and whose Master's Degree Candidacy Forms are on file in the Graduate School Office may take the comprehensive examination. Specific instructions 274 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESand deadlines are included in a letter from the dean. It is the students' responsibility to commu - nicate with their advisers and to notify the Graduate School of their intent to participate by the published deadlines. The completed Petition form, signed by the adviser, should be returned to the Graduate School Office. Students should confirm receipt by the required deadline if mailing forms. The form is available online at www.hood.edu/graduate. The following procedures apply to the comprehensive examination: n Notification of Intention. The student must complete the form entitled Notification of Intent to Take the Comprehensive Examination, secure the signature of the adviser and submit the form to the Graduate School, in accordance with the published deadline. No examination will be assembled unless the form is on file with the Graduate School. The form is available online at www.hood.edu/graduate. Students who require special services, equipment or seating arrangements because of a disability or pregnancy, need to contact the Graduate School Office at (301) 696-3600 or via e-mail at hoodgrad@hood.edu. Accommodations will be made for persons having documented disabilities by the Disability Services Coordinator. n The Questions. Comprehensive examination questions are written by the instructor of each course. n Assembling the Examination. In consultation with the student, the adviser, the depart- ment chair or program director prepares the comprehensive examination. Ordinarily, the test questions are drawn from one department. Occasionally, questions are drawn from several departments and appropriate department chairs are expected to assist the advisers in obtaining questions. Only one question may come from a basic human sciences course. The examination is presented to the Graduate School at least two weeks in advance of the scheduled examina - tion. Comprehensive examination envelopes are assembled for each student. Identifying information and general instructions are on the envelope. The questions, specific directions and blue examination booklets are placed in each envelope. n Administration of the Examination. Comprehensive examinations are administered four times each year. Ordinarily, the examinations are scheduled during the spring and fall semes - ters. The exact dates of the examinations are published in the College calendar for each year. The place of administration of the comprehensive examination will be announced. Students may choose to answer their examination questions in blue examination booklets provided or type them using Hood College desktop computers in the examination room. The examination is administered and proctored by the staff of the Graduate School. The compre - hensive exam is given in two parts, from 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m. The examinations begin at 9 a.m. promptly. All papers must be completed by 4 p.m. Students are expected to comply with the rules of academic conduct found under the Academic Standards section of the catalog. Students who are unable to take a comprehensive examination on the scheduled date because of hardship may petition the adviser for a substitute date. If the adviser approves the petition, the student must contact the Graduate School to make arrangements for the administration of the examination and the substitute date. In all cases, the substitute date must be within 30 days prior to the scheduled examination date. The Graduate School must be informed of any alternate plans. n Grading of the Examination and Reporting the Results. The adviser or the department chair, with the assistance of the departmental instructors, arranges for grading of the examina - tion. Where possible, the original writer of an examination question is called upon to grade that question. Questions are graded on a pass-fail basis. The adviser collects all the graded examination questions and, using departmental guidelines, grades the total examination as either pass or fail. Usually a student's total examination is graded pass when four of five ques - tions are graded pass. However, different departments have different standards for rating the total examination. Frequently two or three faculty members are called upon to read and assist with the evaluation. Once the total examination is evaluated, it is the responsibility of the adviser to notify the student and the Dean of the Graduate School regarding the results of the comprehensive examination. GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 275This notification must be in writing. The process of examination evaluation and notification must be completed within 30 days follow - ing the administration of the examination. Options for Students Who Have Failed the Comprehensive Examination. Only one re-exam - ination may be arranged. Re-examination occurs during the next semester following the initial comprehensive examination, excluding summer session. The student must file another Intent to Take the Comprehensive Examination. The student also confers with her or his adviser six weeks in advance of the re-examination. The student who has failed both the comprehensive examina - tion and re-examination is not eligible for the master's degree, and has no further degree options. If a student fails the comprehensive examination, the only option available to that student is re-examination. The thesis, field work or project option is not available to students who fail a comprehensive examination. Field Work and Independent Research Proj ects A student must have a completed Master's Degree Candidacy Form on file in the Graduate School before the student will be permitted to register for a field work or research project. Regis - tration must be completed during the regular registration period. Students who elect the 6-credit project option will be registered and billed for all 6 credits in one semester. Credits will not be split over the course of multiple semesters. The field work or research project is a culminating activity and therefore should follow all neces - sary work to assure adequate content and methodology. It is required in some degree programs and may be optional in others. Students may elect to do either a 3-credit or a 6-credit field work or research project. Students who elect to do a field work or research project must complete a \"Permission to Enroll\" form for course number 585, Master's Field Work Project, and submit a written proposal to be approved by the field work or research adviser or instructor, program director or department chair and the dean of the Graduate School. The 6-credit research project is similar to a master's thesis in structure, complexity, depth of study and rigor. The Graduate School will continue to re-register students each semester for the field work or research project as \"IP\" (In Progress) until a final grade is submitted. Students are responsible to pay the Graduate School comprehensive fee each fall and spring semester until the project is completed. The 3-credit field work or research project is a disciplined application of theories and techniques learned during the master's study and applied in a field work setting with clearly defined learning objectives. It is graded Satisfactory (S) or Unsatisfactory (U). The grade is awarded by the field work or research adviser or instructor. (The dean of the Graduate School will review the report and verify the approval of the Reading Committee.) The student is responsible for initiating either a 3- or 6-credit field work or research project pro - posal and for securing a field work or research adviser or instructor for the project, who will serve as the chair of the Reading Committee. The adviser and the student, in consultation, will identify two additional persons to serve on the Reading Committee. The basic procedure established for the master's thesis should be followed for the 6-credit research project. The procedure for a well-structured independent study should be followed for the 3-credit field work or research project. The final typed or printed copy of the field work or research project, with the signatures of the Reading Committee, must be delivered to the Graduate School by the student in accordance with the published calendar. The Reading Committee will have reviewed the report for correctness of format, for content, for bibliography, etc. The final report associated with the 3-credit field work or research project, while meeting the requirements of quality and rigor expected at the master's level, is not required to be as extensive in bibliography citations and structure as the 6-credit research report. The title of the report will also be noted in the student's file. The report will then be forwarded to the appropriate department chair or program director. By arrangement with the library, copies of the report from the 6-credit field work project must be bound. A comprehensive examination or thesis option is not available to students who do not satisfacto - rily complete a field work or research project.276 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESMaster's Thesis A student must have a completed Master's Degree Candidacy Form on file in the Graduate School before the student will be permitted to register for thesis preparation. Registration must be completed during the regular registration period by submitting a signed copy of their thesis proposal to the Graduate School. Students will be registered and billed for all 6 credits in one semester. Credits will not be split over the course of multiple semesters. A thesis is required in some degree programs and is an option in others. Before registering for course number 580, Master's Thesis Preparation, a preliminary thesis title and a written proposal must be completed. The proposal with the title page signed by the thesis adviser, program direc - tor and dean of the Graduate School must be submitted and will act as the registration form. The thesis preparation course is a 6-credit course and is graded Satisfactory (S) or Unsatisfactory (U). The grade is awarded by the thesis adviser. Final approval of the dean of the Graduate School is required for completion of the thesis project. A detailed statement of regulations and guidelines concerning the master's thesis is available from the Graduate School or available on our Web site at www.hood.edu/graduate and should be consulted before a student enrolls for Master's Thesis Preparation. A thesis is a 6-credit course; the charge for Master's Thesis Preparation is in accordance with the per credit tuition as indicated in the Graduate Tuition and Financial Arrangements section of this catalog. The Graduate School will continue to re-register students each semester for their Master's Thesis as \"IP\" (In Progress) until a final grade is submitted. Students are responsible to pay the Graduate School comprehensive fee each fall and spring semester until the project is completed. A comprehensive examination or non-thesis option is not available to students who fail a thesis defense. Time Limits All requirements for the degree at Hood must be met within seven years following the date of first enrollment. In the case of students offering transfer credits from other institutions, the seven-year period begins from the date of original recording of the earliest credit accepted for transfer.

A student who will need time beyond the seven year time limit to complete his or her work may request such an extension through his or her adviser. The dean, on the recommendation of the student's adviser and the program director, may grant an extension not to exceed one year. A student may request an extension exceeding one year by petitioning the Graduate Council (please refer to the section titled Exceptions to Academic Policies, Regulations or Requirements).GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 277Transfer of Credit If a student wishes to have credit for prior graduate coursework taken at another accredited institution transferred toward the Hood College degree, she or he must submit a formal written request prior to the completion of the Degree Candidacy Form. A catalog from the former insti - tution with the course description circled, a photocopy of the appropriate page(s) or a course syl - labus and an official copy of the graduate transcript must be sent to the Graduate School Office. The burden of proof for the eligibility of graduate transfer credit is on the student. The procedure for submitting transcripts described in the section, Procedure for Applying, must be followed in order to have the transcript accepted. Students who are enrolled in the Educational Leadership Certification Program are not eligible to transfer credits. Transfer credit must be of good quality and relevant to the student's proposed program. A grade of B (3.0) or better has been used as a standard for the definition of good quality. A faculty adviser, the program director and the dean of the Graduate School will rule on transfer credit. Students seeking transfer credit should also read the section entitled Time Limits. The seven-year time limit begins with the date of the earliest registration for credit accepted for transfer. Under certain circumstances, transfer credit for work completed elsewhere after enrollment at Hood College may be accepted. This transfer credit will not be allowed for work equivalent to courses offered at Hood. Students who take courses before receiving official approval do so at their own risk. Students should submit the course description and transfer request to their adviser for approval. Once approved, the student may enroll in the course. Upon completion, the student should have official transcripts sent to the Graduate School office so that the credits may be ap - plied to their Graduate transcript at Hood. No transfer of credit will be permitted for individual courses carrying fewer than two semester hours of credit. Credits earned on a pass/fail basis will not be accepted for transfer to Hood College graduate programs. A maximum of 6 credits of work appropriate to the program will be permitted in transfer. Students in the MFA program in Ceramic Arts may transfer in a maximum of 9 credits of work. Transfer credit does not apply toward the grade point average. Conferring of Degrees Degrees are formally conferred only at the commencement exercises in May, but for all practi - cal purposes the student has the degree as of the date requirements are completed. Students may petition for graduation three times during the academic year. Degrees are conferred in Septem - ber, January and May. Commencement ceremonies are only held in May. A statement to that effect may be requested from the dean of the Graduate School. All graduating students who have petitioned to graduate with the Graduate School Office will receive full information about com - mencement early in May. Attendance is not required of master's candidates, but all are encour - aged to participate. For further information, see the section on Graduation in this chapter. Graduation Students must complete and submit to the Graduate School Office the Petition to Graduate form by the established deadlines posted to the College's academic calendar, which is available online at www.hood.edu/graduate. To receive the Petition, students must have their signed Master's De - gree Candidacy Form on file in the Graduate School Office and have completed a minimum of 18 graduate credits toward their program requirements. The Petition form includes information for those planning to complete their degree requirements within a year's time, and is available on our Web site at www.hood.edu/graduate. Students must submit their completed Petition forms to the Graduate School Office within the deadlines outlined in the Petition memo. A list of potential graduates for master's degrees is sub - mitted for faculty and trustee approval during their scheduled meetings. If a student petitions the Graduate School Office but does not complete the degree requirements on schedule, the student must resubmit the petition. The College celebrates graduation in formal ceremonies in May. Along with the May graduates, students who receive their degrees in September and in the following January may participate in 278 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIEScommencement exercises in May of the following year. Diplomas issued for September and Janu - ary graduates will be available for pickup by the student in the Graduate School or will be mailed to the student via certified mail.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-380) extends to students the right of access to their education records maintained at the College. The provost, the dean of the Graduate School and the registrar maintain these records for enrolled and former students. Infor - mation and notification as to the type of record; the accessibility of and policies for maintaining, reviewing and expunging the record; and the procedures for inspecting, reviewing, obtaining copies of or challenging the record, are established by the appropriate offices. Financial Obligations and Future Registrations Grades, transcripts, future registrations and diplomas will be withheld and the student will not be graduated until all tuition, fees and other bills incurred at the College have been paid, and all library books returned. Interrupted Studies Students who are away from the College for less than two years will be considered active students and will be maintained on mailing lists, etc. Students whose graduate studies are interrupted or discontinued for more than two years but less than seven years will be classified as inactive stu - dents; they will not be maintained on mailing lists. Inactive students may return to active status by registering for a graduate course. This policy does not alter the seven-year time limit required for the completion of a graduate degree at Hood College. All requirements for the degree at Hood must be met within seven years following the date of first enrollment. Students who do not com - plete their program of study within their seven-year time limit will be automatically withdrawn from the College. Please refer to the section on \"Time Limits\" for information regarding time extensions. Parking Except where marked to the contrary, parking is permitted on a first-come, first-served basis on most lots on the campus.

Religious Observance Hood College recognizes individual student choice in observing religious holidays that occur dur - ing regularly scheduled classes. Students are responsible for work missed.Students with Disabilities Hood College actively supports the rights of students with disabilities to have equal access to education. In accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, Hood makes every reasonable effort to accommodate the needs of students with disabilities. Students who have a disability are asked to notify the Disabilities Services Coordinator as soon as possible. Early notification prevents delay in initiation of services and ensures the student full access to educational activities. The Disabilities Services Coordinator and/or the medical staff, in consultation with the student, prepares a plan for services and forwards authorization for specified services (such as note-taking and interpreting) to the appropriate offices on campus. Transcripts In compliance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, transcript requests must be in writing. Forms are available in the Office of the Registrar or online, www.hood.edu/adminservices/registrar.cfm. Use of Facilities Graduate students may use the academic facilities of the College in a manner consistent with the requirements of the courses in which they are enrolled and only during hours when the academic phase of the College is in operation. Graduate students may use their Graduate Student Identifi - cation Cards to gain admission to the outdoor pool. Grading System Instructors in graduate programs are required to use the following uniform criteria in assigning grades to students: Grade Meaning A Excellent mastery of course content and excellent ability to apply course content concepts. The work displays initiative, independence and application. In some courses, originality may be required. B Good mastery of course content and ability to apply course content concepts. Work shows good grasp of the significance, interrelatedness and uses of the material covered. C Minimal understanding and knowledge of course concepts. F Unsatisfactory understanding of basic facts and principles which constitute the course content. Work receives no academic credit. S Satisfactory performance on thesis, field work or software engineering projects. U Unsatisfactory performance on thesis or field work.Work receives no academic credit. W Withdrawal. This grade is assigned to students who withdraw after the drop/add period and according to withdrawal policy. INC Incomplete work IP In Progress AU This grade is assigned to students who audit courses. Plus and Minus Grades Instructors may use plus (+) and minus (-) signs with grades to provide differentiation among students. Grade Points and Grade Point Averages Each grade has a grade point value. A grade point average of 3.0 is required for graduation and for status as a degree candidate. Only prerequisite and required courses count in the G.P.A. require - ment for graduation. A student whose G.P.A. is below 3.0 after attempting 15 credits is dismissed for academic reasons. GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 279 Grade Point Value Grade Point Value A 4 C+ 2.33 A- 3.67 C 2 B+ 3.33 C- 1.67 B 3 F 0 B- 2.67 U 0 Grades of W and INC carry no point value and are not considered when calculating the G.P.A. Incompletes A substantial portion of a course must be completed before an incomplete is awarded. A grade of \"INC\" (incomplete) will be assigned when illness, emergency or unusual circumstances beyond the student's control prevent the student from completing the assigned coursework and/or examination(s) by the end of the semester or session. A student who wishes to apply for a grade of \"INC\" must secure and complete, with the instruc - tor, the Application for Incomplete Grade form. This form is available from the Graduate School Office or online, www.hood.edu/graduate. The course instructor will identify the deadline date for completion of the work, the conditions under which the grade of \"INC\" will be removed and the consequences for failure to meet those conditions. Both the instructor and the student must sign the Application for Incomplete Grade form. The completed Application for Incomplete Grade form must be submitted to the Graduate School Office for approval by the dean of the Graduate School at the time of the agreement. Any \"INC\" must be removed by the last day of the next calendar semester unless otherwise extended by written permission of the instructor. Any \"INC\" not removed or officially extended will become an F. Academic Semesters and Sessions The academic year at Hood contains a fall semester, a spring semester, a January term and two summer sessions. A calendar published in this catalog gives significant dates within the semesters and sessions. Auditing A student must register for the course to be audited. A student will not receive a grade or credit for an audited course and it will not affect the grade point average; however, the audit does appear on the transcript. New students who would like to audit a course(s) must complete the applica - tion process as a nondegree-seeking student. Only lecture courses can be audited, with permission of the instructor, and are available as space permits. There is no limit on the number of courses a student may audit during a semester. A course that was previously audited may be taken for credit at a later time. Once the course begins, students who register to audit may not change their registration status to credit; however, they may withdraw. Students who register to receive credit for a course may change to audit only dur - ing the first three weeks of the semester or the first week of the summer session. Course Cancellation The Graduate School reserves the right to cancel courses in which fewer than eight students are enrolled. In the event that a course is canceled, full tuition will be reimbursed. Double-Numbered Courses Certain courses have been designated as appropriate for both graduate students and undergradu - ates. These \"double-numbered courses\" are identified by numbers in both the 400 and 500 range. Undergraduate students enroll in the 400-level course and receive undergraduate credit. Graduate students enroll in the 500-level course and receive graduate credit. Graduate students may have different performance standards from the undergraduates that relate to the quality and/or quantity of work required, and may also involve measures of grading at the discretion of individual faculty members. Final examinations for graduate students are normally administered 280 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESGRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 281at a regularly scheduled class meeting. Undergraduates may take their final examinations during undergraduate self-scheduled exam periods. Students who took a double-numbered class at the 400 level as an undergraduate student may not take the same class at the 500 level as a graduate student for credit. Examination of Admissions Folders After the applicant has enrolled at Hood College, she or he may examine the contents of her or his admissions folder in the presence of a College officer at a time and date arranged with the Graduate School. This policy is in conformity with the amended Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, known as the Buckley Amendment. Exemption from Courses A student may request an exemption from taking any course offered. Exemptions are granted by the department that teaches the course for which an exemption is sought. To request an exemp - tion, the student must present a written petition to the program director that offers courses in the field where the exemption is being sought. The petition should include the course number and title for which an exemption is being requested and the justification for the request. The action of the department regarding the request will be forwarded to the Graduate School, which will notify the student regarding the disposition of the request and make the necessary notations in the student's record. Exemption does not constitute credit toward the degree. The total number of credits required for the degree program must be completed in order for the student to qualify for the degree. Independent Study/Research All departments offer a course entitled Independent Study and numbered 575. These courses offer students an opportunity to undertake an individual project supervised by a faculty member. To be eligible for independent study, the student must identify a faculty member who is willing to supervise the independent study project. The College cannot guarantee that all students will be able to undertake an independent study. To register for an independent study, the student must submit to the Graduate School a complet - ed Permission to Enroll Form. The form requires a written proposal and signatures of the student, instructor, program director and dean of the Graduate School. Registration must be completed during the regular registration period. This form is available from the Graduate School Office or online, www.hood.edu/graduate The student and instructor must arrange a regular schedule for conferences and submission of work throughout the semester, including the date when the final paper is due. A student may register for no more than 6 credits of independent study or independent research in any degree program. A student may register for 1, 2 or 3 credits of independent study during any semester or during the summer session. Registration and Enrollment A student must be officially admitted and registered prior to attending any class session of any course. Courses and schedules of classes are announced well in advance of the beginning of each semester and summer session. Dates and hours when students may register and instructions for registering are included with the schedules. Registration dates are also posted to the College's academic calendar, which is available online at www.hood.edu/graduate. Returning students are encouraged to register online using IQ Web. New students may register by submitting the online registration form via secure e-mail submission, by mail, fax or in person. Phone registration will only be taken three weeks before the start of the semester. Students in the Biomedical Science, Computer Science, Humanities, Management of Information Technology and Computer and Information Sciences programs must have their registration forms signed by their adviser prior to submitting them to the Graduate School. Permission may also be e-mailed to the Graduate School at hoodgrad@hood.edu.Students are responsible for seeing that they have met all appropriate prerequisites before register - ing for courses. Failure to meet course prerequisites places the student at risk and will not be considered as cause for a refund of tuition. Students who have not met prerequisites may not be eligible to register. Students who have been admitted to the Graduate School as nondegree seeking students may be required to seek permission from the appropriate instructor or program director in order to enroll. Because some courses may be closed due to heavy student enrollment, students are encouraged to register early. Students nearing the completion of their programs should register as early as possible to avoid facing closed classes. The regular registration period continues through the end of the first day of classes. The Academic Calendar lists the first day of classes for each semester. Repeating Courses There are limited circumstances under which a graduate student may retake a course. A graduate student may retake a course if more than seven years have lapsed or the course content is consid - ered outdated. Students who have failed a course and students in the 30-credit Computer and Information Sciences option who have received less than a B- in a required course may repeat the course once. All grades earned for a course will remain on the academic record and be computed in the cumu - lative grade point average. Only the repeated grades will be factored into the grade point average when considering academic warning, dismissal and degree candidacy. Credit will be awarded only once. Schedule Changes Students may substitute or add courses through the Graduate School only during the first two weeks of classes in the fall and spring semesters, pending that a class has not met more than once and with the written permission of the instructor. During the summer sessions, the substitution or addition of courses is limited to the first two days of classes. All schedule changes must be submitted in writing. Student Course Load To be considered full time, a graduate student must pursue 9 hours of credit each semester. During each six-week summer session, all graduate students are limited to a maximum of 6 credit hours except with permission of the adviser and the dean of the Graduate School. In gauging the amount of time required for study in preparation for classes, the Graduate Council recommends that three or more hours of study be reserved for each hour of class. This is a general recommendation and may vary depending upon the course and individual differences in each student's background. Withdrawal from Classes and Refunds Notification of withdrawal must be in writing and must indicate the course number and course title. Students are encouraged to withdraw by submitting the online withdrawal form via secure e-mail submission. Students may also withdraw by sending an e-mail to hoodgrad@hood.edu, by sending a fax or letter, or by coming to the Graduate School Office in person. If faxing or mailing a withdrawal, it is the student's responsibility to call to ensure receipt. Refunds will be given on the basis of the date and time notification is received in the Graduate School Office. Please refer to the refund schedule in the Academic Calendar, which is available online at www.hood.edu/graduate. Tuition refunds are based on the full tuition charge for the course. A grade of W (indicating withdrawal) will be noted on the student's transcript for withdrawals that occur after the drop/add period. This notation carries no academic penalty. A student who does not give official notice of withdrawal will not be eligible for refunds and a grade of F (Unsatisfactory) will be recorded on the permanent record. The Registrar's Office will notify the instructor when a student withdraws officially. A graduate student may withdraw from a course up to the last three weeks of classes. During the last three weeks of classes, a student may not withdraw from a course. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the Graduate School Office in writing that she or he is withdrawing. 282 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESThe Office of Financial Aid is required to recalculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw. Up through 60 percent of the semester, a pro vata schedule is used to determine how much federal aid a student has earned at the time of withdrawal. The portion of unearned aid must be returned to the federal programs. When unearned aid is returned a student may owe the College additional funds. Failure to begin or ceasing to attend classes does not constitute official notice of with- drawal. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the Graduate School Office in writ- ing of the student's desire to withdraw from a class. Withdrawal from Hood College Students who wish to withdraw from the College must submit their withdrawal notice to the Graduate School in writing. The withdrawal notice should include the reason for the withdrawal and the effective date. Students may withdraw by sending an e-mail to hoodgrad@hood.edu, by sending a fax or letter, or by coming to the Graduate School Office in person. If faxing or mailing a withdrawal, it is the student's responsibility to call to ensure receipt. Students who wish to re-enroll at the College after they have withdrawn must submit a petition for re-admission in writing to the Graduate School. Students who do not complete their program of study within their seven-year time limit will be automatically withdrawn from the College. Please refer to the section on \"Time Limits\" for information regarding time extensions. Exceptions to Academic Policies, Regulations or Requirements Exceptions to academic policies, regulations or requirements as stated in this catalog or elsewhere are rarely made. A student who believes an exception is justified may petition the Graduate Coun - cil. The petition should be addressed to the Council, in care of the dean of the Graduate School, and should state exactly what exception is being requested and the reasons for it. The degree-seeking student's faculty adviser must indicate her or his recommendation in writing; nondegree students should petition through the dean of the Graduate School. A student who is dismissed for academic reasons may petition the Graduate Council for re-admission. A student may not peti - tion for re-admission more than twice. Petitions are to be processed according to the following procedure: n The petition must be forwarded by the petitioner to her or his academic adviser for review and written recommendation. n In cases involving a thesis, computer project or field work project, the academic adviser will forward the petition to the thesis or project adviser. n The reviewed petition will be forwarded by the adviser and/or thesis or project adviser to the program director with the recommendation. n The program director will forward the signed and reviewed petition with the recommendation(s) to the dean of the Graduate School. The student's petition should include the following information: 1) The specific exception being requested and the reason(s) for the request; 2) The expected date of graduation; 3) Any other pertinent information, such as transfer credits, thesis abstract, etc.; 4) All required signatures. Petitions are considered by the Graduate Council's Subcommit - tee on Student Petitions at regularly scheduled meetings. Petitions should be submitted well in advance of the scheduled meeting date. GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIES 283Grade Appeal Grade appeals of the final course grade must be filed in a timely manner. Students should contact the faculty member involved within the first week of the semester following the filing of the disputed grade. If the issue is not satisfactorily resolved, the program director must be contacted within thirty days. If still not satisfied, the student may appeal to the dean of the Graduate School. In such cases, the dean must be contacted prior to the end of the semester immediately following the semester the grade was posted. Failure to follow this timeline provides sufficient grounds for dismissing an appeal. If a student received a final grade in a course that she or he believes is incorrect or unfair, the student should first contact the faculty member involved. The grade appeal request to the faculty member must be in writing. The student must prepare a confidential written grade appeal request, outlining the specific grievances about the grading procedure, grounds for appeal and attach relevant documentation (syllabus, guidelines for papers or presentations, etc.) If, after hearing the professor's explanation, the student still wishes to appeal the grade, she or he should present the grade appeal to the program director. If talks with the faculty member and program director have not resolved the matter the student may file the appeal to the dean of the Gradu - ate School. The last resort of appeal resides with the provost of the College. In each stage of the appeal process the student will receive a letter in writing of the reveiwer's recommendation within 30 days of initiation. All parties to the grade appeal (student, instructor, program director, etc.) are to maintain strict confidentiality until the matter is resolved. 284 GRADUATE ACADEMIC POLICIESCommittee for Biomedical Science. Placement Examination: Applicants may be required to take a preliminary written examination in basic cell biology and biochemistry to enable both the applicant and the faculty to determine whether the individual's current knowledge is adequate for successful completion of the degree requirements. Results of this examination will enable the faculty to advise the applicant regarding course selection. The preliminary examination will be administered during the first semester of study or, in some cases, before graduate study commences.ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AND FIELDS OF STUDY M.S. in Biomedical Science Honorary Adjunct Faculty: Larry Arthur, President, SAIC-NCI-FCRDC; Robert Buckheit, Therimmune Research Corporation; Peter Canonico, Director, Frederick Research Center (Ret.); Mary Carrington, Senior Scientist, Laboratory of Genomic Diversity; Dr. Bruce Crise, Director of Business Development, Advanced Technology Program, NCI-FCRDC; Michael Dean, Chief, Human Genetics Section, Laboratory of Genomic Diversity, NCI-FCRDC; Harvey Gralnick, Chief, Hematology Service, CPD, National Institutes of Health; Mary Kate Hart, Microbiologist, Division of Virology, USAMRIID; Louis Henderson, Supervisor, Protein Chemistry Laboratory, NCI-FCRDC; Dr. Douglas Kuhns, Head, Neutrophil Monitoring Laboratory, NIAID, NIH; Peter Nara, Director of Research and Development, Biological Mimetics, Inc.; Stephen O'Brien, Chief, Laboratory of Genomic Diversity, NCI-FCRDC; Dr. John Ortaldo, Special Volunteer, NCI Frederick, Ortaldo Joseph Rosebrock, G.

This program does not lead to initial teaching certification. The special education program reflects state of Maryland education certification areas: generic (mild and moderate disabilities), noncategorical education for students with disabilities at a designated age-grade level. Four areas of specialization are offered. Students without any teacher certification who are seeking initial certification in Special Education (Grades 1-8) are referred to page 297 Teaching Certification, Post-Baccalaureate Option. Hood does not offer an approved program for currently-certified teachers who wish to obtain additional certification in special education. However, Hood does offer courses and a 6-hour practicum that may satisfy some of the requirements for the Maryland State Department of Education's credit-count certification procedure in early childhood, elementary/middle school or secondary special education. Students who seek additional certification in this manner should see an adviser and request a transcript evaluation from MSDE or local personnel departments. Individuals required to take a 6-hour practicum will take EDUC 550 Internship in Special Education. The internship is not part of the master's program and must be approved by the department. It is also taken in addition to the 36 required credit hours for students seeking the master's degree. 302 M.S. IN CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTIONM.S.

IN MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY The Master of Science in Management of Information Technology is an interdisciplinary gradu - ate degree designed to meet the growing demand for managers with both business and informa - tion technology skills. Managers, in both high technology firms and in firms and organizations that own and utilize information technology (IT) facilities, will often find it necessary to assess corporate IT needs; formalize these needs into requirements and specifications; design integrated IT solutions; assess the cost/benefit of such solutions; determine the impact on operations of such solutions; evaluate alternative technologies; manage the development, implementation and deployment of IT solutions; manage large technology projects; and manage technical employees. The purpose of the Master of Science in Management of Information Technology degree pro - gram is to prepare women and men who will be responsible for managing information technology projects and teams in organizations. This preparation will be accomplished through a comprehen - sive set of studies that provide students with knowledge and skills related to 1) the business issues associated with the management of complex, large technology projects and the people who work within those projects, and 2) the discipline of information technology and the issues that must be confronted in order to consider, design, develop, manage, implement and deploy successful information technology solutions within organizations. The Master of Science in Management of Information Technology is a 36-credit program. A full- time graduate student should be able to complete the requirements for the degree in two years. However, the program is designed to accommodate the needs of professionals attending on a part-time basis who wish to complete their degrees by taking classes in the evening. This program is intended for: n Persons holding a bachelor's degree in computer science or a related field, n Persons holding a bachelor's degree in business, and/or n Persons holding a bachelor's degree in any field and already employed in an information technology area who are seeking additional academic background as part of a career and profes - sional growth program. Persons without this background can successfully enter and complete the program but may have to complete a series of foundation courses in order to attain the appropriate background for study. For admissions information, see Graduate Admissions and Program Specific Application Requirements. Foundation Courses The Master of Science in Management of Information Technology requires the completion of five foundation courses designed to provide the appropriate prerequisite background for the cross-disciplined major. Students with undergraduate coursework in either computer science or business administration may apply for exemptions from the appropriate foundation courses. CS 503 Algorithms and Programming I (3 credits) CS 504 Algorithms and Programming II (3 credits) ECON 551 Foundations of Economics (3 credits) MGMT 551 Management Theory (3 credits) MGMT 552 Quantitative Methods for Managers (3 credits) Required Courses In order to achieve the mission of the Management of Information Technology program, students are expected to have a significant breadth and depth of knowledge in both the management and information technology disciplines.
