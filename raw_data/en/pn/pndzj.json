Introduction This publication explains how individuals claim a deduction for charitable contributions. It dis- cusses the types of organizations to which you can make deductible charitable contributions and the types of contributions you can deduct. It also discusses how much you can deduct, what records you must keep, and how to report chari- table contributions. A charitable contribution is a donation or gift to, or for the use of, a qualified organization. It is voluntary and is made without getting, or ex- pecting to get, anything of equal value. Qualified organizations. Qualified organiza- tions include nonprofit groups that are religious, charitable, educational, scientific, or literary in purpose, or that work to prevent cruelty to chil- dren or animals. You will find descriptions of these organizations under Organizations That Qualify To Receive Deductible Contributions . Schedule A (Form 1040) required. Gener- ally, to deduct a charitable contribution, you must itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040). The amount of your deduction may be limited if certain rules and limits explained in this publication apply to you. Comments and suggestions.

Organizations That Qualify To Receive Deductible Contributions You can deduct your contributions only if you make them to a qualified organization. How to check whether an organization can receive deductible charitable contributions. You can ask any organization whether it is a qualified organization, and most will be able to tell you. You can also check by going to IRS.gov/TEOS . This online tool will enable you to search for qualified organizations. Types of Qualified Organizations Generally, only the following types of organiza- tions can be qualified organizations. 1.A community chest, corporation, trust, fund, or foundation organized or created in or under the laws of the United States, any state, the District of Columbia, or any pos- session of the United States (including Pu- erto Rico). It must, however, be organized and operated only for charitable, religious, scientific, literary, or educational purpo- ses, or for the prevention of cruelty to chil- dren or animals. Certain organizations that foster national or international amateur sports competition also qualify. 561 976 Schedule A (Form 1040) 8283 2.War veterans' organizations, including posts, auxiliaries, trusts, or foundations or- ganized in the United States or any of its possessions (including Puerto Rico). 3.Domestic fraternal societies, orders, and associations operating under the lodge system. (Your contribution to this type of organization is deductible only if it is to be used solely for charitable, religious, scien- tific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals.) 4.Certain nonprofit cemetery companies or corporations. (Your contribution to this type of organization isn't deductible if it can be used for the care of a specific lot or mausoleum crypt.) 5.The United States or any state, the District of Columbia, a U.S. possession (including Puerto Rico), a political subdivision of a state or U.S. possession, or an Indian tribal government or any of its subdivisions that perform substantial government func- tions. (Your contribution to this type of or- ganization is deductible only if it is to be used solely for public purposes.) Example 1. You contribute cash to your city's police department to be used as a reward for information about a crime. The city police department is a qualified organization, and your contribution is for a public purpose. You can deduct your con- tribution. Example 2. You make a voluntary contribution to the social security trust fund, not earmarked for a specific ac- count. Because the trust fund is part of the U.S. Government, you contributed to a qualified organization. You can deduct your contribution. Examples. The following list gives some ex- amples of qualified organizations. Churches, a convention or association of churches, temples, synagogues, mosques, and other religious organizations. Most nonprofit charitable organizations such as the American Red Cross and the United Way. Most nonprofit educational organizations, including the Scouts BSA, Girl Scouts of America, colleges, and museums. This also includes nonprofit daycare centers that provide childcare to the general public if substantially all the childcare is provided to enable parents and guardians to be gainfully employed. However, if your con- tribution is a substitute for tuition or other enrollment fee, it isn't deductible as a char- itable contribution, as explained later under Contributions You Can't Deduct . Nonprofit hospitals and medical research organizations. Utility company emergency energy pro- grams, if the utility company is an agent for a charitable organization that assists indi- viduals with emergency energy needs. Nonprofit volunteer fire companies. Nonprofit organizations that develop and maintain public parks and recreation facili- ties. Civil defense organizations.Page 2 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Page 2 Publication 526 (2022)Canadian charities. You may be able to de- duct contributions to certain Canadian charita- ble organizations covered under an income tax treaty with Canada. To deduct your contribution to a Canadian charity, you must generally have income from sources in Canada. See Pub. 597, Information on the United States-Canada In- come Tax Treaty, for information on how to fig- ure your deduction. Mexican charities. Under the U.S.-Mexico in- come tax treaty, a contribution to a Mexican charitable organization may be deductible, but only if and to the extent the contribution would have been treated as a charitable contribution to a public charity created or organized under U.S. law. To deduct your contribution to a Mexi- can charity, you must have income from sour- ces in Mexico. The limits described in Limits on Deductions , later, apply and are figured using your income from Mexican sources. Israeli charities. Under the U.S.-Israel in- come tax treaty, a contribution to an Israeli charitable organization is deductible if and to the extent the contribution would have been treated as a charitable contribution if the organi- zation had been created or organized under U.S. law. To deduct your contribution to an Isra- eli charity, you must have income from sources in Israel. The limits described in Limits on De- ductions , later, apply. The deduction is also limited to 25% of your AGI from Israeli sources. Contributions You Can Deduct Generally, you can deduct contributions of money or property you make to, or for the use of, a qualified organization. A contribution is \"for the use of\" a qualified organization when it is held in a legally enforceable trust for the quali- fied organization or in a similar legal arrange- ment. The contributions must be made to a quali- fied organization and not set aside for use by a specific person. If you give property to a qualified organiza- tion, you can generally deduct the fair market value (FMV) of the property at the time of the contribution. See Contributions of Property , later. Your deduction for charitable contributions generally can't be more than 60% of your AGI, but in some cases 20%, 30%, or 50% limits may apply. Table 1 gives examples of contributions you can and can't deduct. Contributions From Which You Benefit If you receive a benefit as a result of making a contribution to a qualified organization, you can deduct only the amount of your contribution that is more than the value of the benefit you re- ceive. Also see Contributions From Which You Benefit under Contributions You Can't Deduct , later.If you pay more than FMV to a qualified or- ganization for goods or services, the excess may be a charitable contribution. For the ex- cess amount to qualify, you must pay it with the intent to make a charitable contribution. Example 1. You pay $65 for a ticket to a dinner dance at a church. Your entire $65 pay- ment goes to the church. The ticket to the din- ner dance has a FMV of $25. When you buy your ticket, you know its value is less than your payment. To figure the amount of your charita- ble contribution, subtract the value of the bene- fit you receive ($25) from your total payment ($65). You can deduct $40 as a charitable con- tribution to the church. Example 2. At a fundraising auction con- ducted by a charity, you pay $600 for a week's stay at a beach house. The amount you pay is no more than the fair rental value. You haven't made a deductible charitable contribution. Charity benefit events. If you pay a qualified organization more than FMV for the right to at- tend a charity ball, banquet, show, sporting event, or other benefit event, you can deduct only the amount that is more than the value of the privileges or other benefits you receive. If there is an established charge for the event, that charge is the value of your benefit. If there is no established charge, the reasonable value of the right to attend the event is the value of your benefit. Whether you use the tickets or other privileges has no effect on the amount you can deduct. However, if you return the ticket to the qualified organization for resale, you can deduct the entire amount you paid for the ticket.Even if the ticket or other evidence of payment indicates that the payment is a \"contribution,\" this doesn't mean you can deduct the entire amount. If the ticket shows the price of admission and the amount of the contribution, you can deduct the contribu- tion amount. Example. You pay $40 to see a special showing of a movie for the benefit of a qualified organization. Printed on the ticket is \"Contribu- tion\u2014 $40.\" If the regular price for the movie is $8, your contribution is $32 ($40 payment $8 regular price). State or local tax credit. If you make a pay- ment or transfer property to or for the use of a qualified organization and receive or expect to receive a state or local tax credit in return, then the amount treated as a charitable contribution deduction is reduced by the amount of the state or local tax credit you receive or expect to re- ceive in consideration for your payment or transfer, but an exception may apply. If an ex- ception doesn't apply, you must reduce your charitable contribution deduction even if you can't claim the state tax credit in the year. Exception. If the state or local tax credit you receive or expect to receive doesn't exceed 15% of your payment amount or 15% of the FMV of the transferred property, then your char- itable contribution deduction isn't reduced. Example 1. You make a cash contribution of $1,000 to charity X, a qualified organization. In return for your payment you receive or expect to receive a state tax credit of 70% of your $1,000 contribution. The amount of your chari- table contribution to charity X is reduced by $700 (70% of $1,000). The result is your CAUTION!Examples of Charitable Contributions\u2014A Quick Check Use the following lists for a quick check of whether you can deduct a contribution. See the rest of this publication for more information and additional rules and limits that may apply. Deductible As Charitable ContributionsNot Deductible As Charitable Contributions Money or property you give to: Money or property you give to: Churches, synagogues, temples, mosques, and other religious organizations Federal, state, and local governments, if your contribution is solely for public purposes (for example, a gift to reduce the public debt or maintain a public park) Nonprofit schools and hospitals The Salvation Army, American Red Cross, CARE, Goodwill Industries, United Way, Scouts BSA, Girl Scouts of America, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, etc. War veterans' groups Expenses paid for a student living with you, sponsored by a qualified organization Out-of-pocket expenses when you serve a qualified organization as a volunteerCivic leagues, social and sports clubs, labor unions, and chambers of commerce Foreign organizations (except certain Canadian, Israeli, and Mexican charities) Groups that are run for personal profit Groups whose purpose is to lobby for law changes Homeowners' associations Individuals Political groups or candidates for public office Cost of raffle, bingo, or lottery tickets Dues, fees, or bills paid to country clubs, lodges, fraternal orders, or similar groups Tuition Value of your time or services Value of blood given to a blood bankTable 1.

MUST be removed before printing. Publication 526 (2022) Page 3charitable contribution deduction to charity X can't exceed $300 ($1,000 donation - $700 state tax credit). The reduction applies even if you can't claim the state tax credit for that year. Your deductible charitable contribution to char- ity X is $300. Your total contributions may still be subject to limitations. See Limits on Deduc- tions , later. Example 2. You donate a painting to char- ity Y, a qualified organization. At the time of the donation, the painting has a FMV of $100,000. In return for the painting, you receive or expect to receive a state tax credit of 10% of the FMV of the painting. The state tax credit is $10,000 (10% of $100,000). The amount of your state tax credit does not exceed 15% of the FMV of the painting. As a result, your charitable contri- bution deduction to charity Y is not reduced. Your deductible charitable contribution for your noncash contribution to charity Y is $100,000. However, your total contributions may still be subject to limitations. See Limits on Deductions , later. State or local tax deduction. If you make a payment or transfer property to a qualified or- ganization and receive or expect to receive a state or local tax deduction in return, then the amount of your charitable contribution deduc- tion to the organization may be reduced in some circumstances. If the amount of the state or local tax deduction exceeds the amount of your cash contribution or the FMV of the trans- ferred property, then your charitable contribu- tion deduction is reduced. However, if the amount of the state or local tax deduction doesn't exceed the amount of your payment or the FMV of the transferred property, then no re- duction is necessary. Example 1. You make a cash contribution of $1,000 to charity Z, a qualified organization. Under state law, you are entitled to receive a state tax deduction of $1,000 in return for your payment. The amount of your charitable contri- bution deduction to charity Z isn't reduced. Your charitable contribution deduction to charity Z is $1,000. However, your total contributions may still be subject to limitations. See Limits on De- ductions , later. Membership fees or dues. You may be able to deduct membership fees or dues you pay to a qualified organization. However, you can de- duct only the amount that is more than the value of the benefits you receive. You can't deduct dues, fees, or assess- ments paid to country clubs and other social or- ganizations. They aren't qualified organizations. Certain membership benefits can be dis- regarded. Both you and the organization can disregard the following membership benefits if you get them in return for an annual payment of $75 or less. 1.Any rights or privileges that you can use frequently while you are a member, such as: a.Free or discounted admission to the organization's facilities or events, b.Free or discounted parking,c.Preferred access to goods or serv- ices, and d.Discounts on the purchase of goods and services. But, item (1) doesn't include rights to purchase tickets for seating at an athletic event in an athletic stadium of a college or university as a result of a contribution to such institution. 2.Admission, while you are a member, to events open only to members of the or- ganization if the organization reasonably projects that the cost per person (exclud- ing any allocated overhead) isn't more than $11.70. Token items. You don't have to reduce your contribution by the value of any benefit you re- ceive if both of the following are true. 1.You receive only a small item or other ben- efit of token value. 2.The qualified organization correctly deter- mines that the value of the item or benefit you received isn't substantial and informs you that you can deduct your payment in full. The organization determines whether the value of an item or benefit is substantial by using Rev- enue Procedures 90 -12 and 92-49 and the in- flation adjustment in Revenue Procedure 2021-45. Written statement. A qualified organization must give you a written statement if you make a payment of more than $75 that is partly a contri- bution and partly for goods or services. The statement must say you can deduct only the amount of your payment that is more than the value of the goods or services you received. It must also give you a good faith estimate of the value of those goods or services. The organization can give you the statement either when it solicits or when it receives the payment from you. Exception. An organization won't have to give you this statement if one of the following is true. 1.The organization is: a.A governmental organization descri- bed in (5) under Types of Qualified Organizations , earlier, or b.An organization formed only for reli- gious purposes, and the only benefit you receive is an intangible religious benefit (such as admission to a reli- gious ceremony) that generally isn't sold in commercial transactions out- side the donative context. 2.You receive only items whose value isn't substantial, as described under Token items , earlier. 3.You receive only membership benefits that can be disregarded, as described under Membership fees or dues , earlier.Expenses Paid for Student Living With You You may be able to deduct some expenses of having a student live with you. You can deduct qualifying expenses for a foreign or American student who: 1.Lives in your home under a written agree- ment between you and a qualified organi- zation (defined later) as part of a program of the organization to provide educational opportunities for the student, 2.Isn't your relative (defined later) or de- pendent (also defined later), and 3.Is a full-time student in the twelfth or any lower grade at a school in the United States. You can deduct up to $50 a month for each full calendar month the student lives with you. Any month when condi- tions (1) through (3) are met for 15 or more days counts as a full month. Qualified organization. For these purposes, a qualified organization can be any of the or- ganizations described earlier under Types of Qualified Organizations , except those in (4) and (5). For example, if you are providing a home for a student as part of a state or local govern- ment program, you can't deduct your expenses as charitable contributions. But see Foster pa- rents under Out-of- Pocket Expenses in Giving Services , later, if you provide the home as a foster parent. Relative. The term \"relative\" means any of the following persons. Your child, stepchild, foster child, or a de- scendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild). A legally adopted child is con- sidered your child. Your brother, sister, half brother, half sis- ter, stepbrother, or stepsister. Your father, mother, grandparent, or other direct ancestor. Your stepfather or stepmother. A son or daughter of your brother or sister. A brother or sister of your father or mother. Your son-in-law, daughter-in-law, fa- ther-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law. Dependent. For this purpose, the term \"de- pendent\" means: 1.A person you can claim as a dependent, or 2.A person you could have claimed as a de- pendent except that: a.He or she received gross income of $4,400 or more; b.He or she filed a joint return; or c.You, or your spouse if filing jointly, could be claimed as a dependent on someone else's 2022 return.

Page 4 Publication 526 (2022)Foreign students brought to this coun- try under a qualified international edu- cation exchange program and placed in American homes for a temporary period gen- erally aren't U.S. residents and can't be claimed as dependents. Qualifying expenses. You may be able to de- duct the cost of books, tuition, food, clothing, transportation, medical and dental care, enter- tainment, and other amounts you actually spend for the well-being of the student. Expenses that don't qualify. You can't de- duct depreciation on your home, the FMV of lodging, and similar items not considered amounts actually spent by you. Nor can you de- duct general household expenses, such as taxes, insurance, and repairs. Reimbursed expenses. In most cases, you can't claim a charitable contribution deduc- tion if you are compensated or reimbursed for any part of the costs of having a student live with you. However, you may be able to claim a charitable contribution deduction for the unreim- bursed portion of your expenses if you are reim- bursed only for an extraordinary or one -time item, such as a hospital bill or vacation trip, you paid in advance at the request of the student's parents or the sponsoring organization. Mutual exchange program. You can't de- duct the costs of a foreign student living in your home under a mutual exchange program through which your child will live with a family in a foreign country. Reporting expenses. For a list of what you must file with your return if you deduct expen- ses for a student living with you, see Reporting expenses for student living with you under How To Report , later. Out-of-Pocket Expenses in Giving Services Although you can't deduct the value of your services given to a qualified organization, you may be able to deduct some amounts you pay in giving services to a qualified organization. The amounts must be: Unreimbursed; TIPDirectly connected with the services; Expenses you had only because of the services you gave; and Not personal, living, or family expenses. Table 2 contains questions and answers that apply to some individuals who volunteer their services. Underprivileged youths selected by charity. You can deduct reasonable unreimbursed out-of- pocket expenses you pay to allow under- privileged youths to attend athletic events, mov- ies, or dinners. The youths must be selected by a charitable organization whose goal is to re- duce juvenile delinquency. Your own similar ex- penses in accompanying the youths aren't de- ductible. Conventions. If a qualified organization se- lects you to attend a convention as its represen- tative, you can deduct your unreimbursed ex- penses for travel, including reasonable amounts for meals and lodging, while away from home overnight for the convention. How- ever, see Travel , later. You can't deduct personal expenses for sightseeing, fishing parties, theater tickets, or nightclubs. You also can't deduct travel, meals and lodging, and other expenses for your spouse or children. You can't deduct your travel expenses in at- tending a church convention if you go only as a member of your church rather than as a chosen representative. You can, however, deduct unre- imbursed expenses that are directly connected with giving services for your church during the convention. Uniforms. You can deduct the cost and up- keep of uniforms that aren't suitable for every- day use and that you must wear while perform- ing donated services for a qualified organization. Foster parents. You may be able to deduct as a charitable contribution some of the costs of being a foster parent (foster care provider) if you have no profit motive in providing the foster care and aren't, in fact, making a profit. A quali- fied organization must select the individuals you take into your home for foster care. You can deduct expenses that meet both of the following requirements.1.They are unreimbursed out-of-pocket ex- penses to feed, clothe, and care for the foster child. 2.They are incurred primarily to benefit the qualified organization. Unreimbursed expenses that you can't de- duct as charitable contributions may be consid- ered support provided by you in determining whether you can claim the foster child as a de- pendent. For details, see Pub. 501, Depend- ents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Informa- tion. Example. You cared for a foster child be- cause you wanted to adopt her, not to benefit the agency that placed her in your home. Your unreimbursed expenses aren't deductible as charitable contributions. Church deacon. You can deduct as a charita- ble contribution any unreimbursed expenses you have while in a permanent diaconate pro- gram established by your church. These expen- ses include the cost of vestments, books, and transportation required in order to serve in the program as either a deacon candidate or an or- dained deacon. Car expenses. You can deduct as a charitable contribution any unreimbursed out -of-pocket expenses, such as the cost of gas and oil, di- rectly related to the use of your car in giving services to a charitable organization. You can't deduct general repair and maintenance expen- ses, depreciation, registration fees, or the costs of tires or insurance. If you don't want to deduct your actual ex- penses, you can use a standard mileage rate of 14 cents a mile to figure your contribution. You can deduct parking fees and tolls whether you use your actual expenses or the standard mileage rate. You must keep reliable written records of your car expenses. For more information, see Car expenses under Substantiation Require- ments , later. Travel. Generally, you can claim a charitable contribution deduction for travel expenses nec- essarily incurred while you are away from home performing services for a qualified organization only if there is no significant element of Volunteers' Questions and Answers If you volunteer for a qualified organization, the following questions and answers may apply to you. All of the rules explained in this publication also apply. See, in particular, Out-of-Pocket Expenses in Giving Services . Question Answer I volunteer 6 hours a week in the office of a qualified organization. The receptionist is paid $10 an hour for the same work. Can I deduct $60 a week for my time?No, you can't deduct the value of your time or services. The office is 30 miles from my home. Can I deduct any of my car expenses for these trips? Yes, you can deduct the costs of gas and oil that are directly related to getting to and from the place where you volunteer. If you don't want to figure your actual costs, you can deduct 14 cents for each mile. I volunteer as a Red Cross nurse's aide at a hospital. Can I deduct the cost of the uniforms I must wear?Yes, you can deduct the cost of buying and cleaning your uniforms if the hospital is a qualified organization, the uniforms aren't suitable for everyday use, and you must wear them when volunteering. I pay a babysitter to watch my children while I volunteer for a qualified organization. Can I deduct these costs?No, you can't deduct payments for childcare expenses as a charitable contribution, even if you would be unable to volunteer without childcare. (If you have childcare expenses so you can work for pay, see Pub. 503, Child and Dependent Care Expenses.)Table 2.

You are paying the ex- penses indirectly if you make a payment to the qualified organization and the organization pays for your travel expenses. The deduction for travel expenses won't be denied simply because you enjoy providing services to the qualified organization. Even if you enjoy the trip, you can take a charitable contribution deduction for your travel expenses if you are on duty in a genuine and substantial sense throughout the trip. However, if you have only nominal duties, or if for significant parts of the trip you don't have any duties, you can't de- duct your travel expenses. Example 1. You are a troop leader for a tax-exempt youth group and you take the group on a camping trip. You are responsible for over- seeing the setup of the camp and for providing adult supervision for other activities during the entire trip. You participate in the activities of the group and enjoy your time with them. You over- see the breaking of camp and you transport the group home. You can deduct your travel expen- ses. Example 2. You sail from one island to an- other and spend 8 hours a day counting whales and other forms of marine life. The project is sponsored by a qualified organization. In most circumstances, you can't deduct your expen- ses. Example 3. You work for several hours each morning on an archeological dig spon- sored by a qualified organization. The rest of the day is free for recreation and sightseeing. You can't take a charitable contribution deduc- tion even though you work very hard during those few hours. Example 4. You spend the entire day at- tending a qualified organization's regional meet- ing as a chosen representative. In the evening you go to the theater. You can claim your travel expenses as charitable contributions, but you can't claim the cost of your evening at the thea- ter. Daily allowance (per diem). If you provide services for a qualified organization and receive a daily allowance to cover reasonable travel ex- penses, including meals and lodging while away from home overnight, you must include in income any part of the allowance that is more than your deductible travel expenses. You may be able to deduct any necessary travel expen- ses that are more than the allowance. Deductible travel expenses. These in- clude: Air, rail, and bus transportation; Out-of-pocket expenses for your car; Taxi fares or other costs of transportation between the airport or station and your ho- tel; Lodging costs; and The cost of meals. Because these travel expenses aren't busi- ness- related, they aren't subject to the same limits as business -related expenses. For infor- mation on business travel expenses, see Travel in Pub. 463, Travel, Gift, and Car Expenses. Expenses of Whaling Captains You may be able to deduct as a charitable con- tribution any reasonable and necessary whaling expenses you pay during the year to carry out sanctioned whaling activities. The deduction is limited to $10,000 a year. To claim the deduc- tion, you must be recognized by the Alaska Es- kimo Whaling Commission as a whaling captain charged with the responsibility of maintaining and carrying out sanctioned whaling activities. Sanctioned whaling activities are subsis- tence bowhead whale hunting activities con- ducted under the management plan of the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission. Whaling expenses include expenses for: Acquiring and maintaining whaling boats, weapons, and gear used in sanctioned whaling activities; Supplying food for the crew and other pro- visions for carrying out these activities; and Storing and distributing the catch from these activities. You must keep records showing the time, place, date, amount, and nature of the expenses. For details, see Reve- nue Procedure 2006 -50, 2006 -47 I.R.B. 944, available at IRS.gov/irb/ 2006-47_IRB#RP-2006-50 . Contributions You Can't Deduct There are some contributions you can't deduct and others you can deduct only in part. You can't deduct as a charitable contribu- tion: 1.A contribution to a specific individual, 2.A contribution to a nonqualified organiza- tion, 3.The part of a contribution from which you receive or expect to receive a benefit, 4.The value of your time or services, 5.Your personal expenses, 6.A qualified charitable distribution from an individual retirement arrangement (IRA), 7.Appraisal fees, 8.Certain contributions to donor-advised funds, or 9.Certain contributions of partial interests in property. Detailed discussions of these items follow. RECORDSContributions to Individuals You can't deduct contributions to specific indi- viduals, including the following. Contributions to fraternal societies made for the purpose of paying medical or burial expenses of members. Contributions to individuals who are needy or worthy. You can't deduct these contribu- tions even if you make them to a qualified organization for the benefit of a specific person. But you can deduct a contribution to a qualified organization that helps needy or worthy individuals if you don't indicate that your contribution is for a specific per- son. Example. You can deduct contribu- tions to a qualified organization for flood relief, hurricane relief, or other disaster re- lief. However, you can't deduct contribu- tions earmarked for relief of a particular in- dividual or family. Payments to a member of the clergy that can be spent as he or she wishes, such as for personal expenses. Expenses you paid for another person who provided services to a qualified organiza- tion. Example. Your son does missionary work. You pay his expenses. You can't claim a deduction for the expenses you paid related to his contribution of services. Payments to a hospital that are for a spe- cific patient's care or for services for a spe- cific patient. You can't deduct these pay- ments even if the hospital is operated by a city, state, or other qualified organization. Contributions to Nonqualified Organizations You can't deduct contributions to organizations that aren't qualified to receive tax -deductible contributions, including the following. 1.Certain state bar associations if: a.The bar isn't a political subdivision of a state; b.The bar has private, as well as public, purposes, such as promoting the pro- fessional interests of members; and c.Your contribution is unrestricted and can be used for private purposes. 2.Chambers of commerce and other busi- ness leagues or organizations. 3.Civic leagues and associations. 4.Country clubs and other social clubs. 5.Foreign organizations other than certain Canadian, Israeli, or Mexican charitable organizations. (See Canadian charities , Mexican charities , and Israeli charities un- der Organizations That Qualify To Receive Deductible Contributions , earlier.) Also, you can't deduct a contribution you made to any qualifying organization if the contri- bution is earmarked to go to a foreign or- ganization. However, certain contributions to a qualified organization for use in a pro- gram conducted by a foreign charity may Page 6 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Page 6 Publication 526 (2022)be deductible as long as they aren't ear- marked to go to the foreign charity. For the contribution to be deductible, the qualified organization must approve the program as furthering its own exempt purposes and must keep control over the use of the con- tributed funds. The contribution is also de- ductible if the foreign charity is only an ad- ministrative arm of the qualified organization. 6.Homeowners' associations. 7.Labor unions. 8.Political organizations and candidates. Contributions From Which You Benefit If you receive or expect to receive a financial or economic benefit as a result of making a contri- bution to a qualified organization, you can't de- duct the part of the contribution that represents the value of the benefit you receive. See Contri- butions From Which You Benefit under Contri- butions You Can Deduct , earlier. These contri- butions include the following. Contributions to a college or university if the amount paid is to (or for the benefit of) a college or university in exchange for tick- ets (or the right to buy tickets) to an athletic event in an athletic stadium of the college or university. Contributions from which you receive or expect to receive a credit or deduction against state or local taxes unless an ex- ception applies. See State or local tax credit and State or local tax deduction , ear- lier. Contributions for lobbying. This includes amounts you earmark for use in, or in con- nection with, influencing specific legisla- tion. Contributions to a retirement home for room, board, maintenance, or admittance. Also, if the amount of your contribution de- pends on the type or size of apartment you will occupy, it isn't a charitable contribu- tion. Costs of raffles, bingo, lottery, etc. You can't deduct as a charitable contribution amounts you pay to buy raffle or lottery tickets or to play bingo or other games of chance. For information on how to report gambling winnings and losses, see Expen- ses You Can Deduct in Pub. 529. Dues to fraternal orders and similar groups. However, see Membership fees or dues under Contributions From Which You Benefit , earlier. Tuition, or amounts you pay instead of tui- tion. You can't deduct as a charitable con- tribution amounts you pay as tuition even if you pay them for children to attend paro- chial schools or qualifying nonprofit day- care centers. You also can't deduct any fixed amount you must pay in addition to, or instead of, tuition to enroll in a private school, even if it is designated as a \"dona- tion.\" Contributions connected with split-dollar insurance arrangements. You can't deduct any part of a contribution to a qualified or- ganization if, in connection with the contribution, the organization directly or in- directly pays, has paid, or is expected to pay any premium on any life insurance, an- nuity, or endowment contract for which you, any member of your family, or any other person chosen by you (other than a qualified charitable organization) is a bene- ficiary. Example. You donate money to a qualified organization. The charity uses the money to purchase a cash value life insur- ance policy. The beneficiaries under the in- surance policy include members of your family. Even though the charity may even- tually get some benefit out of the insurance policy, you can't deduct any part of the donation. Qualified Charitable Distributions A qualified charitable distribution (QCD) is a distribution made directly by the trustee of your individual retirement arrangement (IRA), other than an SEP or SIMPLE IRA, to certain qualified organizations. You must have been at least age 701/2 when the distribution was made. Your total QCDs for the year can't be more than $100,000. If all the requirements are met, a QCD may be nontaxable, however if the QCD is nontaxable, you may not be able to claim it as a charitable contribution deduction. You may be able to claim a charitable contribution deduction if you claim the income you are deducting as a quali- fied contribution. See Pub. 590 -B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs), for more information about QCDs. Value of Time or Services You can't deduct the value of your time or serv- ices, including: Blood donations to the American Red Cross or to blood banks, and The value of income lost while you work as an unpaid volunteer for a qualified organi- zation. Personal Expenses You can't deduct personal, living, or family ex- penses, such as the following items. The cost of meals you eat while you per- form services for a qualified organization, unless it is necessary for you to be away from home overnight while performing the services. Adoption expenses, including fees paid to an adoption agency and the costs of keep- ing a child in your home before the adop- tion is final. However, you may be able to claim a tax credit for these expenses. Also, you may be able to exclude from your gross income amounts paid or reimbursed by your employer for your adoption expen- ses. See Form 8839, Qualified Adoption Expenses, and its instructions, for more in- formation.Appraisal Fees You can't deduct as a charitable contribution any fees you pay to find the FMV of donated property. Contributions to Donor-Advised Funds You can't deduct a contribution to a donor -ad- vised fund if: The qualified organization that sponsors the fund is a war veterans' organization, a fraternal society, or a nonprofit cemetery company; or You don't have an acknowledgment from that sponsoring organization that it has ex- clusive legal control over the assets con- tributed. There are also other circumstances in which you can't deduct your contribution to a do- nor-advised fund. Generally, a donor -advised fund is a fund or account in which a donor can, because of being a donor, advise the fund how to distribute or in- vest amounts held in the fund. For details, see Internal Revenue Code section 170(f)(18). Partial Interest in Property Generally, you can't deduct a contribution of less than your entire interest in property. For de- tails, see Partial Interest in Property under Con- tributions of Property , later. Contributions of Property If you contribute property to a qualified organi- zation, the amount of your charitable contribu- tion is generally the FMV of the property at the time of the contribution. However, if the prop- erty has increased in value, you may have to make some adjustments to the amount of your deduction. See Giving Property That Has In- creased in Value , later. For information about the records you must keep and the information you must furnish with your return if you donate property, see Substan- tiation Requirements and How To Report , later. Contributions Subject to Special Rules Special rules apply if you contribute: Clothing or household items; A car, boat, or airplane; Taxidermy property; Property subject to a debt; A partial interest in property; A fractional interest in tangible personal property; A qualified conservation contribution; A future interest in tangible personal prop- erty; Inventory from your business; or A patent or other intellectual property. These special rules are described next.Page 7 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Publication 526 (2022) Page 7Clothing and Household Items You can't take a deduction for clothing or household items you donate unless the clothing or household items are in good used condition or better. Exception. You can take a deduction for a contribution of an item of clothing or a house- hold item that isn't in good used condition or better if you deduct more than $500 for it, and include a qualified appraisal prepared by a qualified appraiser and a completed Form 8283, Section B. Household items. Household items include: Furniture and furnishings, Electronics, Appliances, Linens, and Other similar items. Household items don't include: Food; Paintings, antiques, and other objects of art; Jewelry and gems; and Collections. FMV. To determine the FMV of these items, use the rules under Determining FMV , later. Cars, Boats, and Airplanes The following rules apply to any donation of a qualified vehicle. A qualified vehicle is: A car or any motor vehicle manufactured mainly for use on public streets, roads, and highways; A boat; or An airplane. Deduction more than $500. If you donate a qualified vehicle with a claimed FMV of more than $500, you can deduct the smaller of: The gross proceeds from the sale of the vehicle by the organization, or The vehicle's FMV on the date of the con- tribution. If the vehicle's FMV was more than your cost or other basis, you may have to reduce the FMV to figure the de- ductible amount, as described under Giv- ing Property That Has Increased in Value , later. Form 1098 -C. You must attach to your re- turn Copy B of the Form 1098 -C, Contributions of Motor Vehicles, Boats, and Airplanes (or other statement containing the same informa- tion as Form 1098 -C) you received from the or- ganization. The Form 1098 -C (or other state- ment) will show the gross proceeds from the sale of the vehicle. If you e-file your return, you must: Attach Copy B of Form 1098-C to Form 8453, U.S. Individual Income Tax Trans- mittal for an IRS e-file Return, and mail the forms to the IRS; or Include Copy B of Form 1098-C as a pdf attachment if your software program allows it.If you don't attach Form 1098 -C (or other statement), you can't deduct your contribution. You must get Form 1098 -C (or other state- ment) within 30 days of the sale of the vehicle. But if Exception 1 or 2 (described later) applies, you must get Form 1098 -C (or other statement) within 30 days of your donation. Filing deadline approaching and still no Form 1098 -C. If the filing deadline is ap- proaching and you still don't have a Form 1098-C, you have two choices. 1.Request an automatic 6-month extension of time to file your return. You can get this extension by filing Form 4868, Application for Automatic Extension of Time To File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return. For more information, see the Instructions for Form 4868. 2.File the return on time without claiming the deduction for the qualified vehicle. After receiving the Form 1098-C, file an amen- ded return, Form 1040-X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, claiming the deduction. Attach Copy B of Form 1098-C (or other statement) to the amended re- turn. Exceptions. There are two exceptions to the rules just described for deductions of more than $500. Exception 1 \u2014Vehicle used or improved by organization. If the qualified organization makes a significant intervening use of, or mate- rial improvement to, the vehicle before transfer- ring it, you can generally deduct the vehicle's FMV at the time of the contribution. But if the vehicle's FMV was more than your cost or other basis, you may have to reduce the FMV to get the deductible amount, as described under Giv- ing Property That Has Increased in Value , later. The Form 1098- C (or other statement) will show whether this exception applies. Exception 2 \u2014Vehicle given or sold to needy individual. If the qualified organization will give the vehicle, or sell it for a price well be- low FMV, to a needy individual to further the or- ganization's charitable purpose, you can gener- ally deduct the vehicle's FMV at the time of the contribution. But if the vehicle's FMV was more than your cost or other basis, you may have to reduce the FMV to get the deductible amount, as described under Giving Property That Has Increased in Value , later. The Form 1098 -C (or other statement) will show whether this excep- tion applies. This exception doesn't apply if the organiza- tion sells the vehicle at auction. In that case, you can't deduct the vehicle's FMV. Example. B donates a used car to a quali- fied organization. They bought it 3 years ago for $9,000. A used car guide shows the FMV for this type of car is $6,000. However, B gets a Form 1098- C from the organization showing the car was sold for $2,900. Neither Exception 1 nor Exception 2 applies. If B itemizes their de- ductions, they can deduct $2,900 for their dona- tion. must attach Form 1098 -C and Form 8283, Noncash Charitable Contributions, to their tax return.Deduction $500 or less. If the qualified or- ganization sells the vehicle for $500 or less and Exceptions 1 and 2 don't apply, you can deduct the smaller of: $500, or The vehicle's FMV on the date of the con- tribution. But if the vehicle's FMV was more than your cost or other basis, you may have to reduce the FMV to get the deducti- ble amount, as described under Giving Property That Has Increased in Value , later. If the vehicle's FMV is at least $250 but not more than $500, you must have a written state- ment from the qualified organization acknowl- edging your donation. The statement must con- tain the information and meet the tests for an acknowledgment described under Deductions of at Least $250 but Not More Than $500 under Substantiation Requirements , later. FMV. To determine a vehicle's FMV, use the rules described under Determining FMV , later. Donations of inventory. The vehicle dona- tion rules just described don't apply to dona- tions of inventory. For example, these rules don't apply if you are a car dealer who donates a car you had been holding for sale to custom- ers. See Inventory , later. Taxidermy Property If you donate taxidermy property to a qualified organization, your deduction is limited to your basis in the property or its FMV, whichever is less. This applies if you prepared, stuffed, or mounted the property or paid or incurred the cost of preparing, stuffing, or mounting the property. Your basis for this purpose includes only the cost of preparing, stuffing, and mounting the property. Your basis doesn't include transporta- tion or travel costs. It also doesn't include the di- rect or indirect costs for hunting or killing an ani- mal, such as equipment costs. In addition, it doesn't include the value of your time. Taxidermy property means any work of art that: Is the reproduction or preservation of an animal, in whole or in part; Is prepared, stuffed, or mounted to recre- ate one or more characteristics of the ani- mal; and Contains a part of the body of the dead an- imal. Property Subject to a Debt If you contribute property subject to a debt (such as a mortgage), you must reduce the FMV of the property by: 1.Any allowable deduction for interest you paid (or will pay) that is attributable to any period after the contribution, and 2.If the property is a bond, the lesser of: a.Any allowable deduction for interest you paid (or will pay) to buy or carry the bond that is attributable to any pe- riod before the contribution; orPage 8 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Page 8 Publication 526 (2022)b.The interest, including bond discount, receivable on the bond that is attribut- able to any period before the contribu- tion, and that isn't includible in your in- come due to your accounting method. This prevents you from deducting the same amount as both investment interest and a chari- table contribution. If the recipient (or another person) assumes the debt, you must also reduce the FMV of the property by the amount of the outstanding debt assumed. The amount of the debt is also treated as an amount realized on the sale or exchange of property for purposes of figuring your taxable gain (if any). For more information, see Bargain Sales under Giving Property That Has In- creased in Value , later. Partial Interest in Property Generally, you can't deduct a charitable contri- bution of less than your entire interest in prop- erty. Right to use property. A contribution of the right to use property is a contribution of less than your entire interest in that property and isn't deductible. Example 1. You own a 10 -story office building and donate rent -free use of the top floor to a qualified organization. Because you still own the building, you have contributed a partial interest in the property and can't take a deduction for the contribution. Example 2. C owns a vacation home at the beach and sometimes rents it to others. For a fundraising auction at church, C donated the right to use the vacation home for 1 week. At the auction, the church received and accepted a bid from D equal to the fair rental value of the home for 1 week. C can't claim a deduction be- cause of the partial interest rule. D can't claim a deduction either, because of the received bene- fit equal to the amount of D's payment. See Contributions From Which You Benefit , earlier. Exceptions. You can deduct a charitable con- tribution of a partial interest in property only if that interest represents one of the following items. A remainder interest in your personal home or farm. A remainder interest is one that passes to a beneficiary after the end of an earlier interest in the property. Example. You keep the right to live in your home during your lifetime and give your church a remainder interest that be- gins upon your death. You can deduct the value of the remainder interest. An undivided part of your entire interest. This must consist of a part of every sub- stantial interest or right you own in the property and must last as long as your in- terest in the property lasts. But see Frac- tional Interest in Tangible Personal Prop- erty, later. Example. You contribute voting stock to a qualified organization but keep the right to vote the stock. The right to vote is a substantial right in the stock. You haven't contributed an undivided part of your entire interest and can't deduct your contribution. A partial interest that would be deductible if transferred to certain types of trusts. A qualified conservation contribution (de- fined later). For information about how to figure the value of a contribution of a partial interest in property, see Partial Interest in Property Not in Trust in Pub. 561. Fractional Interest in Tangible Personal Property You can't deduct a charitable contribution of a fractional interest in tangible personal property unless all interests in the property are held im- mediately before the contribution by: You, or You and the qualifying organization receiv- ing the contribution. If you make an additional contribution later, the FMV of that contribution will be determined by using the smaller of: The FMV of the property at the time of the initial contribution, or The FMV of the property at the time of the additional contribution. Tangible personal property is defined later under Future Interest in Tangible Personal Property . A fractional interest in property is an undivided portion of your entire interest in the property. Example. An undivided one -quarter inter- est in a painting that entitles an art museum to possession of the painting for 3 months of each year is a fractional interest in the property. Recapture of deduction. You must recapture your charitable contribution deduction by in- cluding it in your income if both of the following statements are true. 1.You contributed a fractional interest in tan- gible personal property after August 17, 2006. 2.You don't contribute the rest of your inter- ests in the property to the original recipient or, if it no longer exists, another qualified organization on or before the earlier of: a.The date that is 10 years after the date of the initial contribution, or b.The date of your death. Recapture is also required if the qualified or- ganization hasn't taken substantial physical possession of the property and used it in a way related to the organization's purpose during the period beginning on the date of the initial contri- bution and ending on the earlier of: 1.The date that is 10 years after the date of the initial contribution, or 2.The date of your death. Additional tax. If you must recapture your deduction, you must also pay interest and an additional tax equal to 10% of the amount re- captured. Qualified Conservation Contribution A qualified conservation contribution is a contri- bution of a qualified real property interest to a qualified organization to be used only for con- servation purposes. Qualified organization. For purposes of a qualified conservation contribution, a qualified organization is: A governmental unit; A publicly supported charity; or An organization controlled by, and oper- ated for the exclusive benefit of, a govern- mental unit or a publicly supported charity. The organization must also have a commitment to protect the conservation purposes of the donation and must have the resources to en- force the restrictions. A publicly supported charity is an organiza- tion of the type described in (1) under Types of Qualified Organizations , earlier, that normally receives a substantial part of its support, other than income from its exempt activities, from di- rect or indirect contributions from the general public or from governmental units. Qualified real property interest. This is any of the following interests in real property. 1.Your entire interest in real estate other than a mineral interest (subsurface oil, gas, or other minerals, and the right of ac- cess to these minerals). 2.A remainder interest. 3.A restriction (granted in perpetuity) on the use that may be made of the real property. Conservation purposes. Your contribution must be made only for one of the following con- servation purposes. Preserving land areas for outdoor recrea- tion by, or for the education of, the general public. Protecting a relatively natural habitat of fish, wildlife, or plants, or a similar ecosys- tem. Preserving open space, including farmland and forest land, if it yields a significant pub- lic benefit. The open space must be pre- served either for the scenic enjoyment of the general public or under a clearly de- fined federal, state, or local governmental conservation policy. Preserving a historically important land area or a certified historic structure. Building in registered historic district. If a building in a registered historic district is a certi- fied historic structure, a contribution of a quali- fied real property interest that is an easement or other restriction on the exterior of the building is deductible only if it meets all of the following conditions. 1.The restriction must preserve the entire exterior of the building (including its front, sides, rear, and height) and must prohibit any change to the exterior of the building Page 9 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Publication 526 (2022) Page 9that is inconsistent with its historical char- acter. 2.You and the organization receiving the contribution must enter into a written agreement certifying, under penalty of per- jury, that the organization: a.Is a qualified organization with a pur- pose of environmental protection, land conservation, open space pres- ervation, or historic preservation; and b.Has the resources to manage and en- force the restriction and a commit- ment to do so. 3.You must include with your return: a.A Qualified appraisal , performed by a Qualified appraiser ; b.Photographs of the building's entire exterior; and c.A description of all restrictions on de- velopment of the building, such as zoning laws and restrictive covenants. If you claimed the rehabilitation credit for the building for any of the 5 years before the year of the contribution, your charitable deduction is re- duced. For more information, see Form 3468, Investment Credit, and Internal Revenue Code section 170(f)(14). If you claim a deduction of more than $10,000, your deduction won't be allowed un- less you pay a $500 filing fee. See Form 8283- V, Payment Voucher for Filing Fee Under Section 170(f)(13), and its instructions. More information. For information about de- termining the FMV of qualified conservation contributions, see Pub. 561. For information about the limits that apply to deductions for this type of contribution, see Limits on Deductions , later. For more information about qualified con- servation contributions, see Regulations section 1.170A-14. New limitations on a deduction for the contribution of a qualified conservation easement made on or after December 30, 2022 may apply. See Section 605 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023. Future Interest in Tangible Personal Property You can't deduct the value of a charitable con- tribution of a future interest in tangible personal property until all intervening interests in and rights to the actual possession or enjoyment of the property have either expired or been turned over to someone other than yourself, a related person, or a related organization. But see Frac- tional Interest in Tangible Personal Property , earlier, and Tangible personal property put to unrelated use , later. Related persons include your spouse, chil- dren, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, and pa- rents. Related organizations may include a part- nership or corporation in which you have an interest, or an estate or trust with which you have a connection. CAUTION!Tangible personal property. This is any property, other than land or buildings, that can be seen or touched. It includes furniture, books, jewelry, paintings, and cars. Future interest. This is any interest that is to begin at some future time, regardless of whether it is designated as a future interest un- der state law. Example. You own an antique car that you contribute to a museum. You give up owner- ship, but retain the right to keep the car in your garage with your personal collection. Because you keep an interest in the property, you can't deduct the contribution. If you turn the car over to the museum in a later year, giving up all rights to its use, possession, and enjoyment, you can take a deduction for the contribution in that later year. Inventory If you contribute inventory (property you sell in the course of your business), the amount you can deduct is the smaller of its FMV on the day you contributed it or its basis. The basis of con- tributed inventory is any cost incurred for the in- ventory in an earlier year that you would other- wise include in your opening inventory for the year of the contribution. You must remove the amount of your charitable contribution deduc- tion from your opening inventory. It isn't part of the cost of goods sold. If the cost of donated inventory isn't included in your opening inventory, the inventory's basis is zero and you can't claim a charitable contri- bution deduction. Treat the inventory's cost as you would ordinarily treat it under your method of accounting. For example, include the pur- chase price of inventory bought and donated in the same year in the cost of goods sold for that year. A special rule applies to certain donations of food inventory. See Food Inventory , later. Patents and Other Intellectual Property If you donate intellectual property to a qualified organization, your deduction is limited to the ba- sis of the property or the FMV of the property, whichever is smaller. Intellectual property means any of the following. Patents. Copyrights (other than a copyright descri- bed in Internal Revenue Code sections 1221(a)(3) or 1231(b)(1)(C)). Trademarks. Trade names. Trade secrets. Know-how. Software (other than software described in Internal Revenue Code section 197(e)(3) (A)(i)). Other similar property or applications or registrations of such property. Additional deduction based on income. You may be able to claim additional charitable contribution deductions in the year of the contri-bution and years following, based on the in- come, if any, from the donated property. The following table shows the percentage of income from the property that you can deduct for each of your tax years ending on or after the date of the contribution. In the table, \"tax year 1,\" for example, means your first tax year end- ing on or after the date of the contribution. How- ever, you can take the additional deduction only to the extent the total of the amounts figured us- ing this table is more than the amount of the de- duction claimed for the original donation of the property. After the legal life of the intellectual property ends, or after the 10th anniversary of the dona- tion, whichever is earlier, no additional deduc- tion is allowed. The additional deductions can't be taken for intellectual property donated to certain private foundations. Tax year Deductible percentage 1 100% 2 100% 3 90% 4 80% 5 70% 9 30% 10 20% 11 10% 12 10% Reporting requirements. You must inform the organization at the time of the donation that you intend to treat the donation as a contribu- tion subject to the provisions just discussed. The organization is required to file an infor- mation return showing the income from the property, with a copy to you. This is done on Form 8899, Notice of Income From Donated In- tellectual Property. Determining FMV This section discusses general guidelines for determining the FMV of various types of dona- ted property. Pub. 561 contains a more com- plete discussion. FMV is the price at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither having to buy or sell, and both having reasonable knowledge of all the rel- evant facts. Used clothing. The FMV of used clothing and other personal items is usually far less than the price you paid for them. There are no fixed for- mulas or methods for finding the value of items of clothing. You should claim as the value the price that buyers of used items actually pay in used cloth- ing stores, such as consignment or thrift shops.Page 10 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Page 10 Publication 526 (2022)Also see Clothing and Household Items , earlier. Example. Z donated a coat to a thrift store operated by their church. Z paid $300 for the coat 3 years ago. Similar coats in the thrift store sell for $50. The FMV of the coat is $50. Z's donation is limited to $50. Household items. The FMV of used house- hold items, such as furniture, appliances, and linens, is usually much lower than the price paid when new. These items may have little or no market value because they are in a worn condi- tion, out of style, or no longer useful. For these reasons, formulas (such as using a percentage of the cost to buy a new replacement item) aren't acceptable in determining value. You should support your valuation with pho- tographs, canceled checks, receipts from your purchase of the items, or other evidence. Maga- zine or newspaper articles and photographs that describe the items and statements by the recipients of the items are also useful. Don't in- clude any of this evidence with your tax return. If the property is valuable because it is old or unique, see the discussion under Paintings, An- tiques, and Other Objects of Art in Pub. 561. Also see Clothing and Household Items , earlier. Article of clothing or household item over $500 not in good used condition. Form 8283, Section B, must be completed and the Form 8283 attached to the tax return if you are contributing a single article of clothing or house- hold item over $500 that is not in good used condition. See the Form 8283 instructions for more information. Cars, boats, and airplanes. If you contribute a car, boat, or airplane to a qualified organiza- tion, you must determine its FMV. Qualified vehicle donation. You don't need a written appraisal for a qualified vehi- cle \u2014 such as a car, boat, or airplane \u2014 if your deduction for the qualified vehicle is limited to the gross proceeds from its sale and you ob- tained a contemporaneous written acknowledg- ment (CWA) , defined later. If you donate a qualified vehicle with a claimed value of more than $500, you can't claim a deduction unless you attach to Form 8283 a copy of the CWA you received from the donee organization. See Qualified Vehicle Donations in the Instructions for Form 8283. Boats. Except for small, inexpensive boats, the valuation of boats should be based on an appraisal by a marine surveyor or ap- praiser because the physical condition is critical to the value. Cars. Certain commercial firms and trade organizations publish used car pricing guides, commonly called \"blue books,\" containing com- plete dealer sale prices or dealer average pri- ces for recent model years. The guides may be published monthly or seasonally, and for differ- ent regions of the country. These guides also provide estimates for adjusting for unusual equipment, unusual mileage, and physical con- dition. The prices aren't \"official\" and these pub- lications aren't considered an appraisal of any specific donated property. But they do provide clues for making an appraisal and suggest rela- tive prices for comparison with current sales and offerings in your area. These publications are sometimes available from public libraries, or from the loan officer at a bank, credit union, or finance company. You can also find used car pricing information on the Internet. To find the FMV of a donated car, use the price listed in a used car guide for a private party sale, not the dealer retail value. However, the FMV may be less if the car has engine trou- ble, body damage, high mileage, or any type of excessive wear. The FMV of a donated car is the same as the price listed in a used car guide for a private party sale only if the guide lists a sales price for a car that is the same make, model, and year, sold in the same area, in the same condition, with the same or similar op- tions or accessories, and with the same or simi- lar warranties as the donated car. Example. You donate a used car in poor condition to a local high school for use by stu- dents studying car repair. A used car guide shows the dealer retail value for this type of car in poor condition is $1,600. However, the guide shows the price for a private party sale of the car is only $750. The FMV of the car is consid- ered to be $750. Large quantities. If you contribute a large number of the same item, FMV is the price at which comparable numbers of the item are be- ing sold. Example. You purchase 500 copies of a religious book for $1,000. The person who sells them to you says the retail value of these books is $3,000. If you contribute the books to a quali- fied organization, you can claim a deduction only for the price at which similar numbers of the same books are currently being sold. Your charitable contribution is $1,000, unless you can show that similar numbers of that book were selling at a different price at the time of the contribution. Giving Property That Has Decreased in Value If you contribute property with a FMV that is less than your basis in it, your deduction is limited to its FMV. You can't claim a deduction for the dif- ference between the property's basis and its FMV. Your basis in property is generally what you paid for it. If you need more information about basis, see Pub. 551, Basis of Assets. You may want to see Pub. 551 if you contribute property that you: Received as a gift or inheritance; Used in a trade, business, or activity con- ducted for profit; or Claimed a casualty loss deduction for. Common examples of property that de- crease in value include clothing, furniture, appli- ances, and cars.Giving Property That Has Increased in Value If you contribute property with a FMV that is more than your basis in it, you may have to re- duce the FMV by the amount of appreciation (increase in value) when you figure your deduc- tion. Your basis in property is generally what you paid for it. If you need more information about basis, see Pub. 551. Different rules apply to figuring your deduc- tion, depending on whether the property is: Ordinary income property, or Capital gain property. Ordinary Income Property Property is ordinary income property if you would have recognized ordinary income or short- term capital gain had you sold it at FMV on the date it was contributed. Examples of or- dinary income property are inventory, works of art created by the donor, manuscripts prepared by the donor, and capital assets (defined later, under Capital Gain Property ) held 1 year or less. Property used in a trade or business. Property used in a trade or business is consid- ered ordinary income property to the extent of any gain that would have been treated as ordi- nary income because of depreciation had the property been sold at its FMV at the time of con- tribution. See chapter 3 of Pub. 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, for the kinds of property to which this rule applies. Amount of deduction. The amount you can deduct for a contribution of ordinary income property is its FMV minus the amount that would be ordinary income or short -term capital gain if you sold the property for its FMV. Gener- ally, this rule limits the deduction to your basis in the property. Example. You donate stock you held for 5 months to your synagogue. The FMV of the stock on the day you donate it is $1,000, but you paid only $800 (your basis). Because the $200 of appreciation would be short -term capi- tal gain if you sold the stock, your deduction is limited to $800 (FMV minus the appreciation). Exception. Don't reduce your charitable contribution if you include the ordinary or capital gain income in your gross income in the same year as the contribution. See Ordinary or capital gain income included in gross income under Capital Gain Property next, if you need more in- formation. Capital Gain Property Property is capital gain property if you would have recognized long -term capital gain had you sold it at FMV on the date of the contribution. Capital gain property includes capital assets held more than 1 year. Capital assets. Capital assets include most items of property you own and use for personal purposes or investment. Examples of capital Page 11 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Publication 526 (2022) Page 11assets are stocks, bonds, jewelry, coin or stamp collections, and cars or furniture used for per- sonal purposes. For purposes of figuring your charitable con- tribution, capital assets also include certain real property and depreciable property used in your trade or business and, generally, held more than 1 year. You may, however, have to treat this property as partly ordinary income property and partly capital gain property. See Property used in a trade or business under Ordinary In- come Property , earlier. Real property. Real property is land and generally anything built on, growing on, or at- tached to land. Depreciable property. Depreciable prop- erty is property used in business or held for the production of income and for which a deprecia- tion deduction is allowed. For more information about what is a capital asset, see chapter 2 of Pub. 544. Amount of deduction \u2014General rule. When figuring your deduction for a contribution of cap- ital gain property, you can generally use the FMV of the property. Exceptions. However, in certain situa- tions, you must reduce the FMV by any amount that would have been long -term capital gain if you had sold the property for its FMV. Gener- ally, this means reducing the FMV to the prop- erty's cost or other basis. You must do this if: 1.The property (other than qualified appreci- ated stock) is contributed to certain private nonoperating foundations, 2.You choose the 50% limit instead of the 30% limit for capital gain property given to 50% limit organizations, discussed later, 3.The contributed property is intellectual property (as defined earlier under Patents and Other Intellectual Property ), 4.The contributed property is certain taxi- dermy property, as explained earlier, or 5.The contributed property is tangible per- sonal property (defined earlier) that: a.Is put to an unrelated use (defined later) by the charity, or b.Has a claimed value of more than $5,000 and is sold, traded, or other- wise disposed of by the qualified or- ganization during the year in which you made the contribution, and the qualified organization hasn't made the required certification of exempt use (such as on Form 8282, Donee Infor- mation Return, Part IV). See also Re- capture if no exempt use , later. Contributions to private nonoperating foun- dations. The reduced deduction applies to contributions to all private nonoperating founda- tions other than those qualifying for the 50% limit, discussed later. However, the reduced deduction doesn't ap- ply to contributions of qualified appreciated stock. Qualified appreciated stock is any stock in a corporation that is capital gain property and for which market quotations are readily availa- ble on an established securities market on the day of the contribution. But stock in a corpora- tion doesn't count as qualified appreciated stock to the extent you and your family contrib- uted more than 10% of the value of all the out- standing stock in the corporation. Tangible personal property put to unrelated use. Tangible personal property is defined ear- lier under Future Interest in Tangible Personal Property . Unrelated use. The term \"unrelated use\" means a use unrelated to the exempt purpose or function of the qualified organization. For a governmental unit, it means the use of the con- tributed property for other than exclusively pub- lic purposes. Example. If a painting contributed to an educational institution is used by that organiza- tion for educational purposes by being placed in its library for display and study by art students, the use isn't an unrelated use. But if the painting is sold and the proceeds are used by the organ- ization for educational purposes, the use is an unrelated use. Deduction limited. Your deduction for a contribution of tangible personal property may be limited. See (5) under Exceptions , earlier. Recapture if no exempt use. You must re- capture part of your charitable contribution de- duction by including it in your income if all the following statements are true. 1.You donate tangible personal property with a claimed value of more than $5,000, and your deduction is more than your ba- sis in the property. 2.The organization sells, trades, or other- wise disposes of the property after the year it was contributed but within 3 years of the contribution. 3.The organization doesn't provide a written statement (such as on Form 8282, Part IV), signed by an officer of the organiza- tion under penalty of perjury, that either: a.Certifies its use of the property was substantial and related to the organi- zation's purpose, or b.Certifies its intended use of the prop- erty became impossible. If all the preceding statements are true, in- clude in your income: 1.The deduction you claimed for the prop- erty, minus 2.Your basis in the property when you made the contribution. Include this amount in your income for the year the qualified organization disposes of the prop- erty. Report the recaptured amount on Sched- ule 1 (Form 1040), line 8z. Ordinary or capital gain income included in gross income. You don't reduce your charita- ble contribution if you include the ordinary or capital gain income in your gross income in the same year as the contribution. This may hap-pen when you transfer installment or discount obligations or when you assign income to a qualified organization. If you contribute an obli- gation received in a sale of property that is re- ported under the installment method, see Pub. 537, Installment Sales. Example. You donate an installment note to a qualified organization. The note has a FMV of $10,000 and a basis to you of $7,000. As a result of the donation, you have a short -term capital gain of $3,000 ($10,000 $7,000), which you include in your income for the year. Your charitable contribution is $10,000. Food Inventory Special rules apply to certain donations of food inventory to a qualified organization. These rules apply if all the following conditions are met. 1.You made a contribution of apparently wholesome food from your trade or busi- ness. Apparently wholesome food is food intended for human consumption that meets all quality and labeling standards imposed by federal, state, and local laws and regulations even though the food may not be readily marketable due to appear- ance, age, freshness, grade, size, surplus, or other conditions. 2.The food is to be used only for the care of the ill, the needy, or infants. 3.The use of the food is related to the organ- ization's exempt purpose or function. 4.The organization doesn't transfer the food for money, other property, or services. 5.You receive a written statement from the organization stating it will comply with re- quirements (2), (3), and (4). 6.The organization isn't a private nonoperat- ing foundation. 7.The food satisfies any applicable require- ments of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and regulations on the date of transfer and for the previous 180 days. If all the conditions just described are met, use the following worksheet to figure your de- duction.Page 12 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

This is your charitable contribution deduction for the food .................. Worksheet instructions. When determining the FMV to enter on line 1 of the worksheet, take into account the price at which the same or substantially the same food items (as to both type and quality) were sold by you at the time of the contribution. Don't reduce this amount be- cause the food wasn't or couldn't be sold by reason of your internal standards, lack of mar- ket, or similar circumstances. Also, don't reduce this amount even though you produced the food exclusively for the purpose of transferring the food to a qualified organization. If you don't account for inventories under section 471 and you aren't required to capitalize indirect costs under section 263A, you may elect, solely for the purpose of line 2 of the worksheet, to treat the basis of any apparently wholesome food as being equal to 25% of the FMV of such food. Enter on line 11 of the worksheet, 15% of your net income for the year from all sole pro- prietorships, S corporations, or partnerships (or other entity that isn't a C corporation) from which contributions of food inventory were made. Figure net income before any deduction for a charitable contribution of food inventory. If you made more than one contribution of food inventory, complete a separate worksheet for each contribution. Complete lines 11 and 12 on only one worksheet. On that worksheet, complete line 11. Then compare line 11 and the total of the line 10 amounts on all worksheets and enter the smaller of those amounts on line 12. If line 11 is smaller than line 10, you can carry over the excess as a qualifying food in- ventory contribution to the following year. You may be able to include the excess in your chari- table contribution deduction for the food in each of the next 5 years in order of time until it is used up, but not beyond that time. More information. See Inventory , earlier, for information about determining the basis of do- nated inventory and the effect on cost of goods sold. For additional details, see section 170(e) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Bargain Sales A bargain sale of property is a sale or exchange for less than the property's FMV. A bargain sale to a qualified organization is partly a charitable contribution and partly a sale or exchange. Part that is a sale or exchange. The part of the bargain sale that is a sale or exchange may result in a taxable gain. For more information on figuring the amount of any taxable gain, see Bargain sales to charity in chapter 1 of Pub. 544. Part that is a charitable contribution. Fig- ure the amount of your charitable contribution in three steps. Step 1. Subtract the amount you received for the property from the property's FMV at the time of sale. This gives you the FMV of the con- tributed part. Step 2. Find the adjusted basis of the con- tributed part. It equals: Adjusted basis of entire propertyFair market valueof contributed part Fair market value of entire property/H11003 Step 3. Determine whether the amount of your charitable contribution is the FMV of the contributed part (which you found in Step 1 ) or the adjusted basis of the contributed part (which you found in Step 2 ). Generally, if the property sold was capital gain property, your charitable contribution is the FMV of the contrib- uted part. If it was ordinary income property, your charitable contribution is the adjusted ba- sis of the contributed part. See Ordinary Income Property and Capital Gain Property , both ear- lier, for more information. Example. You sell ordinary income prop- erty with a FMV of $10,000 to a mosque for $2,000. Your basis is $4,000 and your AGI is $20,000. You make no other contributions dur- ing the year. The FMV of the contributed part of the property is $8,000 ($10,000 $2,000). The adjusted basis of $3,200 ($4,000 \u00d7 ($8,000 \u00f7 $10,000)). Because the property is ordinary income property, your char- itable deduction is limited to the adjusted basis of the contributed part. You can deduct $3,200. Penalty You may be liable for a penalty if you overstate the value or adjusted basis of contributed prop- erty. 20% penalty. The penalty is 20% of the amount by which you underpaid your tax be- cause of the overstatement, if:1.The value or adjusted basis claimed on your return is 150% or more of the correct amount, and 2.You underpaid your tax by more than $5,000 because of the overstatement. 40% penalty. The penalty is 40%, rather than 20%, if: 1.The value or adjusted basis claimed on your return is 200% or more of the correct amount, and 2.You underpaid your tax by more than $5,000 because of the overstatement. When To Deduct You can deduct your contributions only in the year you actually make them in cash or other property (or in a later carryover year, as ex- plained under How To Figure Your Deduction When Limits Apply , later). This applies whether you use the cash or an accrual method of ac- counting. Time of making contribution. Usually, you make a contribution at the time of its uncondi- tional delivery. Checks. A check you mail to a charity is considered delivered on the date you mail it. Text message. Contributions made by text message are deductible in the year you send the text message if the contribution is charged to your telephone or wireless account. Credit card. Contributions charged on your bank credit card are deductible in the year you make the charge. Pay-by- phone account. Contributions made through a pay -by-phone account are con- sidered delivered on the date the financial insti- tution pays the amount. This date should be shown on the statement the financial institution sends you. Stock certificate. A properly endorsed stock certificate is considered delivered on the date of mailing or other delivery to the charity or to the charity's agent. However, if you give a stock certificate to your agent or to the issuing corporation for transfer to the name of the char- ity, your contribution isn't delivered until the date the stock is transferred on the books of the corporation. Promissory note. If you issue and deliver a promissory note to a charity as a contribution, it isn't a contribution until you make the note payments. Option. If you grant a charity an option to buy real property at a bargain price, it isn't a contribution until the charity exercises the op- tion. Borrowed funds. If you contribute bor- rowed funds, you can deduct the contribution in the year you deliver the funds to the charity, re- gardless of when you repay the loan. Conditional gift. If your contribution de- pends on a future act or event to become effec- tive, you can't take a deduction unless there is Page 13 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Publication 526 (2022) Page 13only a negligible chance the act or event won't take place. If your contribution would be undone by a later act or event, you can't take a deduction un- less there is only a negligible chance the act or event will take place. Example 1. You contribute cash to a local school board, which is a political subdivision of a state, to help build a school gym. The school board will refund the money to you if it doesn't collect enough to build the gym. You can't de- duct your contribution until there is no chance (or only a negligible chance) of a refund. Example 2. You donate land to a city for as long as the city uses it for a public park. The city plans to use the land for a park, and there is no chance (or only a negligible chance) of the land being used for any different purpose. You can deduct your charitable contribution in the year you make the contribution. Limits on Deductions If your total contributions for the year are 20% or less of your AGI, you don't need to read the rest of this section. The remaining limits discussed in this section don't apply to you. The amount you can deduct for charitable contributions is generally limited to no more than 60% of your AGI. Your deduction may be further limited to 50%, 30%, or 20% of your AGI, depending on the type of property you give and the type of organization you give it to. The tem- porary 100% limit available for 2020 and 2021 for certain qualified cash contributions no lon- ger applies. For 2022, your deduction for cash contributions is limited to 60% of your AGI mi- nus your deductions for all other contributions. These limits are described in detail in this sec- tion. Your AGI is the amount on Form 1040 line 11. If your contributions are more than any of the limits that apply, see Carryovers under How To Figure Your Deduction When Limits Apply , later. Out-of- pocket expenses. Amounts you spend performing services for a charitable or- ganization may be deductible as a contribution to a qualified organization. If so, your deduction is subject to the limit applicable to donations to that organization. For example, the 30% limit applies to amounts you spend on behalf of a private nonoperating foundation. Types of Qualified Organizations For the purpose of applying the deduction limits to your charitable contributions, qualified organ- izations can be divided into two categories. First category of qualified organizations (50% limit organizations). The first category includes only the following types of qualified or- ganizations. (These organizations are also TIPsometimes referred to as \"50% limit organiza- tions.\") 1.Churches and conventions or associations of churches. 2.Educational organizations with a regular faculty and curriculum that normally have a regularly enrolled student body attend- ing classes on site. 3.Hospitals and certain medical research or- ganizations associated with these hospi- tals. 4.Organizations that are operated only to re- ceive, hold, invest, and administer prop- erty and to make expenditures to or for the benefit of state and municipal colleges and universities and that normally receive substantial support from the United States or any state or their political subdivisions, or from the general public. 5.The United States or any state, the District of Columbia, a U.S. possession (including Puerto Rico), a political subdivision of a state or U.S. possession, or an Indian tribal government or any of its subdivisions that perform substantial government func- tions. 6.Publicly supported charities, . 7.Organizations that may not qualify as \"publicly supported\" but that meet other tests showing they respond to the needs of the general public, not a limited number of donors or other persons. They must normally receive more than one-third of their support either from organizations de- scribed in (1) through (6), or from persons other than \"disqualified persons.\" 8.Most organizations operated or controlled by, and operated for the benefit of, those organizations described in (1) through (7). 9.Private operating foundations. 10. Private nonoperating foundations that make qualifying distributions of 100% of contributions within 21/2 months following the year they receive the contribution. A deduction for charitable contributions to any of these private nonoperating founda- tions must be supported by evidence from the foundation confirming it made the qualifying distributions timely. Attach a copy of this supporting data to your tax re- turn. 11. A private foundation whose contributions are pooled into a common fund, if the foundation would be described in (8) but for the right of substantial contributors to name the public charities that receive con- tributions from the fund. The foundation must distribute the common fund's income within 21/2 months following the tax year in which it was realized and must distribute the corpus not later than 1 year after the donor's death (or after the death of the do- nor's surviving spouse if the spouse can name the recipients of the corpus). You can ask any organization whether it is a 50% limit organization, and most will be able to tell you. Also see How to check whether an or- ganization can receive deductible charitable contributions , earlier. Second category of qualified organizations. The second category includes any type of quali- fied organization that isn't in the first category. Limits The limit that applies to a contribution depends on the type of property you give and which cate- gory of qualified organization you give it to. The amount of a contribution you can deduct is gen- erally limited to a percentage of your AGI, but may be further reduced if you make contribu- tions that are subject to more than one of the limits discussed in this section. Your total deduction of charitable contribu- tions can't exceed your AGI. If your contribu- tions are subject to more than one of the limits, you include all or part of each contribution in a certain order, carrying over any excess to a subsequent year (if allowed). See How To Fig- ure Your Deduction When Limits Apply and Carryovers , later, for more information about or- dering and carryovers. Limit based on 100% of AGI The 100% carryover limit available for certain qualified cash contributions for 2020 and 2021 no longer applies for carryovers of those contributions to 2022 or later years. Carryover amounts from contribu- tions made in 2020 or 2021 are subject to a 60% limitation if you deduct those amounts for 2022 or later years. Qualified conservation contributions of farmers and ranchers. If you are a qualified farmer or rancher, your deduction for a qualified conservation contribution (QCC) is limited to 100% of your AGI minus your deduction for all other charitable contributions. However, if the donated property is used in agriculture or live- stock production (or is available for such pro- duction), the contribution must be subject to a restriction that the property remain available for such production. If not, the limit is 50%. For more information about applying the 50% limit to a QCC, see Qualified conservation contribu- tions , later, under Limits based on 50% of AGI . Qualified farmer or rancher. You are a qualified farmer or rancher if your gross income from the trade or business of farming is more than 50% of your gross income for the year. Limit based on 60% of AGI If you make cash contributions during the year to an organization described earlier under First category of qualified organizations (50% limit organizations) , your deduction for the cash con- tributions is 60% of your AGI. This 60% limit doesn't apply to noncash charitable contributions. See Noncash contribu- tions to 50% limit organizations , later, if you contribute something other than cash to a 50% limit organization. CAUTION!Page 14 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Page 14 Publication 526 (2022)Example 1. You gave your temple a $200 cash contribution. The limit based on 60% of AGI will apply to the cash contribution to the temple because it is an organization described earlier under First category of qualified organi- zations (50% limit organizations) and because the contribution was cash. Example 2. You donated clothing to your synagogue with a FMV of $200. The limit based on 60% of AGI doesn't apply because the con- tribution is not cash. Instead, a limit based on 50% of AGI discussed later will apply to the contribution to the synagogue because it is an organization described earlier under First cate- gory of qualified organizations (50% limit organ- izations) . \"For the use of\" contribution exception. A 30% limit applies to cash contributions that are \"for the use of\" the qualified organizations instead of \"to\" the qualified organization. A con- tribution is \"for the use of\" a qualified organiza- tion when it is held in a legally enforceable trust for the qualified organization or in a similar legal arrangement. See Contributions to the second category of qualified organizations or \"for the use of\" any qualified organization , later, under Limits based on 30% of AGI , for more informa- tion. Limits based on 50% of AGI There are two 50% limits that may apply to your contributions. Noncash contributions to 50% limit organi- zations. If you make noncash contributions to organizations described earlier under First cate- gory of qualified organizations (50% limit organ- izations) , your deduction for the noncash contri- butions is limited to 50% of your AGI minus your cash contributions subject to the 60% limit. Capital gain property exception. A 30% limit applies to noncash contributions of capital gain property if you figure your deduction using FMV without reduction for appreciation. See Certain capital gain property contributions to 50% limit organizations , later, under Limits based on 30% of AGI , for more information. \"For the use of\" contribution exception. A 20% or 30% limit applies to noncash contribu- tions that are \"for the use of\" the or- ganization instead of \"to\" the qualified organiza- tion. A contribution is \"for the use of\" a qualified organization when it is held in a legally enforce- able trust for the qualified organization or in a similar legal arrangement. If the noncash contri- bution is capital gain property, see Limit based on 20% of AGI , later, for more information; oth- erwise, see Contributions to the second cate- gory of qualified organizations or \"for the use of\" any qualified organization , later, under Limits based on 30% of AGI , for more information. Qualified conservation contributions. Your deduction for qualified conservation contribu- tions (QCCs) is limited to 50% of your AGI mi- nus your deduction for all other charitable con- tributions.If you are a farmer or rancher, go to Qualified conservation contributions of farmers or ranchers , earlier, under Lim- its based on 100% of AGI , to see if that limit ap- plies to your QCC instead. Limits based on 30% of AGI These are two 30% limits that may apply to your contributions. The 30% limit for capital gain property contributions to a 50% limit organiza- tion is separate from the 30% limit that applies to your other contributions. Both are separately reduced by contributions made to a 50% limit organization, but the amount allowed after ap- plying one of the 30% limits doesn't reduce the amount allowed after applying the other 30% limit. However, as a result of applying the sepa- rate limits, the total contributions subject to a 30% limit will never be more than 50% of your AGI. Example. Your AGI is $50,000. During the year, you gave capital gain property with a FMV of $15,000 to an organization described earlier under First category of qualified organizations (50% limit organizations) . You don't choose to reduce the property's FMV by its appreciation in value. You also gave $10,000 cash to a quali- fied organization that is described earlier under Second category of qualified organizations (meaning it isn't a 50% limit organization). The $15,000 contribution of capital gain property is subject to one 30% limit and the $10,000 cash contribution is subject to the other 30% limit. The $10,000 cash contribution is fully deducti- ble because the contribution is not more than the smaller of (i) 30% of your AGI ($15,000) and (ii) 50% of your AGI minus all contributions to a 50% limit organization ($25,000 - $15,000 = $10,000). The $15,000 is also fully deductible because the contribution is not more than 30% of your AGI minus all contributions to a 50% limit organization subject to the 60% or 50% limit (other than qualified conservation contribu- tions) ($25,000 - $10,000 = $15,000). Neither amount is reduced by the other, so the total de- ductible contribution is $25,000 (which is also not more than $50,000 of your AGI). Contributions to the second category of qualified organizations or \"for the use of\" any qualified organization. If you make cash contributions or noncash contributions (other than capital gain property) during the year (1) to an organization described earlier under Second category of qualified organizations , or (2) \"for the use of\" any qualified organization, your de- duction for those contributions is limited to 30% of your AGI, or if less, 50% of your AGI minus all your contributions to 50% limit organizations (other than contributions subject to a 100% limit or qualified conservation contributions). For this purpose, contributions to 50% limit organiza- tions include all capital gain property contribu- tions to a 50% limit organization (other than qualified conservation contributions), even those that are subject to the 30% limit, dis- cussed later. A contribution is \"for the use of\" a qualified organization when it is held in a legally enforce- able trust for the qualified organization or in a similar legal arrangement. TIPIf you make a contribution of capital gain property to an organization other than a 50% limit organization or \"for the use of\" any qualified organization, see Limit based on 20% of AGI , later. Student living with you. Deductible amounts you spend on behalf of a student living with you are subject to this 30% limit. These amounts are considered a contribution for the use of a qualified organization. See Expenses Paid for Student Living With You , earlier, for more information. Certain capital gain property contributions to 50% limit organizations. Your noncash contributions of capital gain property to 50% limit organizations is limited to 30% of your AGI minus all your contributions to 50% limit organi- zations that are subject to the 60% and 50% limits (other than qualified conservation contri- butions). The limit that applies to capital gain property contributions to 50% limit organiza- tions doesn't apply to qualified conservation contributions. If you are making a qualified con- servation contribution (QCC), see Qualified conservation contributions and Qualified con- servation contributions of farmers and ranchers , earlier, for the limits to apply to a QCC. Election to apply the 50% limit. You may choose the 50% limit for contributions of capital gain property to organizations described earlier under First category of qualified organizations (50% limit organizations) instead of the 30% limit that would otherwise apply. See Capital gain property election , later, under How To Fig- ure Your Deduction When Limits Apply , for more information about making this election and how to adjust the amount of your contribu- tion. Limit based on 20% of AGI If you make noncash contributions of capital gain property during the year (1) to an organiza- tion described earlier under Second category of qualified organizations , or (2) \"for the use of\" any qualified organization, your deduction for those contributions is limited to 20% of your AGI or, if less, the smallest of the following. 1.30% of your AGI minus all your contribu- tions that are subject to a limit based on 30% of AGI. 2.30% of your AGI minus all your capital gain contributions that are subject to the limit based on 30% of AGI. 3.50% of your AGI minus all contributions subject to the limits based on 60%, 50%, and 30% of AGI (other than qualified con- servation contributions). A contribution is \"for the use of\" a qualified organization when it is held in a legally enforce- able trust for the qualified organization or in a similar legal arrangement.Page 15 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Publication 526 (2022) Page 15How To Figure Your Deduction When Limits Apply If your contributions are subject to more than one of the limits discussed earlier, use the fol- lowing steps to figure the amount of your contri- butions that you can deduct. 1.Cash contributions subject to the limit based on 60% of AGI. Deduct the contri- butions that don't exceed 60% of your AGI. 2.Noncash contributions (other than quali- fied conservation contributions) subject to the limit based on 50% of AGI. Deduct the contributions that don't exceed 50% of your AGI minus your cash contributions to a 50% limit organization. 3.Cash and noncash contributions (other than capital gain property) subject to the limit based on 30% of AGI. Deduct the contributions that don't exceed the smaller of: a.30% of your AGI, or b.50% of your AGI minus your contribu- tions to a 50% limit organization (other than qualified conservation contribu- tions), including capital gain property subject to the limit based on 30% of AGI. 4.Contributions of capital gain property sub- ject to the limit based on 30% of AGI. De- duct the contributions that don't exceed the smaller of: a.30% of your AGI, or b.50% of your AGI minus your contribu- tions subject to the limits based on 60% or 50% of AGI (other than quali- fied conservation contributions). 5.Contributions of capital gain property sub- ject to the limit based on 20% of AGI. De- duct the contributions that don't exceed the smaller of: a.20% of your AGI, b.30% of your AGI minus your contribu- tions of capital gain property subject to the limit based on 30% of AGI, c.30% of your AGI minus your other contributions subject to the limit based on 30% of AGI, or d.50% of your AGI minus your contribu- tions subject to the limits based on 60%, 50%, and 30% of AGI (other than qualified conservation contribu- tions). 6.Qualified conservation contributions sub- ject to the limit based on 50% of AGI. De- duct the contributions that don't exceed 50% of your AGI minus any deductible contributions figured in (1) through (5). 7.Qualified conservation contributions of farmers and ranchers subject to the limit based on 100% of AGI. Deduct the contri- butions that don't exceed 100% of your AGI minus any deductible contributions figured in (1) through (6). 8.Carryovers of qualified contributions for re- lief efforts in a qualified disaster area sub- ject to the limit based on 60% of AGI. De- duct the carryover contributions that don't exceed 60% of your AGI minus all your other deductible contributions. These steps are incorporated into Work- sheet 2. Example. Your AGI is $50,000. In March, you gave your mosque $2,000 cash and land with a FMV of $28,000 and a basis of $22,000. You held the land for investment purposes for more than 1 year. You don't make the capital gain property election for this year. See Capital gain property election , later. Therefore, the amount of your charitable contribution for the land would be its FMV of $28,000. You also gave $5,000 cash to a private nonoperating foundation to which the 30% limit applies. The $2,000 cash donated to the mosque is considered first and is fully deductible. Your contribution to the private nonoperating founda- tion is considered next. Because the total of your cash contribution of $2,000 and your capi- tal gain property of $28,000 to a 50% limit or- ganization ($30,000) is more than $25,000 (50% of $50,000), your contribution to the pri- vate nonoperating foundation isn't deductible for the year. It can be carried over to later years. See Carryovers , later. The contribution of land is considered next. Your deduction for the land is limited to $15,000 (30% \u00d7 $50,000). The un- used part of the contribution ($13,000) can be carried over. For this year, your deduction is limited to $17,000 ($2,000 + $15,000). Capital gain property election. You may choose the 50% limit for contributions of capital gain property to qualified organizations descri- bed earlier under First category of qualified or- ganizations (50% limit organizations) instead of the 30% limit that would otherwise apply. If you make this choice, you must reduce the FMV of the property contributed by the appreciation in value that would have been long -term capital gain if the property had been sold. This choice applies to all capital gain prop- erty contributed to 50% limit organizations dur- ing a tax year. It also applies to carryovers of this kind of contribution from an earlier tax year. For details, see Carryover of capital gain prop- erty, later. You must make the choice on your original return or on an amended return filed by the due date for filing the original return. Example. In the previous example, if you choose to have the 50% limit apply to the land (the 30% capital gain property) given to your mosque, you must reduce the FMV of the prop- erty by the appreciation in value. Therefore, the amount of your charitable contribution for the land would be its basis to you of $22,000. You add this amount to the $2,000 cash contributed to the mosque. You can now deduct $1,000 of the amount donated to the private nonoperating foundation because the total of your contribu- tions of cash ($2,000) and capital gain property ($22,000) to 50% limit organizations is $1,000 less than the limit based on 50% of AGI. Your total deduction for the year is $25,000 ($2,000 cash to your mosque, $22,000 for property do- nated to your mosque, and $1,000 cash to the private nonoperating foundation). You can carry over to later years the part of your contribution to the private nonoperating foundation that you couldn't deduct ($4,000). Instructions for Worksheet 2 You can use Worksheet 2 if you made charita- ble contributions during the year, and one or more of the limits described in this publication under Limits on Deductions apply to you. You can't use this worksheet if you have a carryover of a charitable contribution from an earlier year. If you have a carryover from an earlier year, see Carryovers , later. The following list gives instructions for com- pleting the worksheet. The terms used in the worksheet are ex- plained earlier in this publication. If the result on any line is less than zero, enter zero. For contributions of property, enter the property's FMV unless you elected (or were required) to reduce the FMV as ex- plained under Giving Property That Has In- creased in Value . In that case, enter the re- duced amount.Page 16 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs.

Any amounts in the carryover column are not deductible this year but can be carried over to next year. See Carryovers , later, for more information about how you will use them next year. Carryovers You can carry over any contributions you can't deduct in the current year because they exceed the limits based on your AGI. Except for quali- fied conservation contributions, you may be able to deduct the excess in each of the next 5 years until it is used up, but not beyond that time. A carryover of a qualified conservation con- tribution can be carried forward for 15 years. Generally, contributions you carry over are subject to the same percentage limits in the year to which they are carried as they were in the year of the contribution. For example, contri- butions subject to the 20% limit in the year in which they are made are 20% limit contributions in the year to which they are carried. But see Carryover of capital gain property , later. The 100% carryover limit available in 2021 for certain qualified cash contri- butions made in 2020 no longer applies for carryovers of those contributions to 2022 or later years. Carryover amounts from contribu- tions made in 2020 or 2021 are subject to a 60% limitation if you deduct those amounts for 2022 or later years. For each category of contributions, you de- duct carryover contributions only after deduct- ing all allowable contributions in that category for the current year. If you have carryovers from 2 or more prior years, use the carryover from the earlier year first. Note. A carryover of a contribution to a 50% limit organization must be used before contributions in the current year to organiza- tions other than 50% limit organizations. See Example 2 . Example 1. Last year, you made cash contributions of $11,000 to 50% limit organiza- tions. Because of the limit based on 60% of AGI, you deducted only $10,000 and carried over $1,000 to this year. This year, your AGI is $20,000 and you made cash contributions of $9,500 to 50% limit organizations. The limit based on 60% of AGI applies to your current year cash contribution of $9,500 and carryover contribution of $1,000. You can deduct this CAUTION!year's cash contribution and your carryover cash contribution in full because your total cash contributions of $10,500 ($9,500 + $1,000) is less than $12,000 (60% of $20,000). Example 2. This year, your AGI is $24,000. You make cash contributions of $6,000 to which the 60% limit applies and $3,000 to which the 30% limit applies. You have a contribution carryover from last year of $5,000 for capital gain property contributed to a 50% limit organization and subject to the special 30% limit for contributions of capital gain prop- erty. Your cash contribution of $6,000 is fully de- ductible because it is less than $14,400 (which is 60% of your AGI). The deduction for your 30% limit contribu- tions of $3,000 is limited to 2.$1,000 amount is 50% of $24,000, your AGI. The $11,000 amount is the sum of your current and carryover contributions to 50% limit organizations, $6,000 + $5,000.) The deduction for your $5,000 carryover is subject to the special 30% limit for contributions of capital gain property. This means it is limited to the smaller of: 1.$7,200 (your 30% limit), or 2.$5,000 ($12,000, your 50% limit, minus your allowable cash contributions to which the 60% limit applies ($6,000) and minus your allowable contribution to which the 30% limit applies ($1,000)). Because your $5,000 carryover contribution does not exceed the smaller limit of $5,000, you can deduct it in full. Your deduction is $12,000 ($6,000 + $1,000 + $5,000). You carry over the $2,000 balance of your 30% limit contributions for this year to next year. Carryover of capital gain property. If you carry over contributions of capital gain property subject to the special 30% limit and you choose in the next year to use the 50% limit and take appreciation into account, you must refigure the carryover. Reduce the FMV of the property by the appreciation and reduce that result by the amount actually deducted in the previous year.Example. Last year, your AGI was $50,000 and you contributed capital gain prop- erty valued at $27,000 to a 50% limit organiza- tion and didn't choose to use the 50% limit. Your basis in the property was $20,000. Your deduction was limited to $15,000 (30% of $50,000), and you carried over $12,000. This year, your AGI is $60,000 and you contribute capital gain property valued at $25,000 to a 50% limit organization. Your basis in the prop- erty is $24,000 and you choose to use the 50% limit. You must refigure your carryover as if you had taken appreciation into account last year as well as this year. Because the amount of your contribution last year would have been $20,000 (the property's basis) instead of the $15,000 you actually deducted, your carryover is $5,000 $24,000 cur- rent contribution plus your $5,000 carryover). Additional rules for carryovers. Special rules exist for computing carryovers if you: Are married in some years but not others, Have different spouses in different years, Change from a separate return to a joint re- turn in a later year, Change from a joint return to a separate re- turn in a later year, Have a net operating loss, Claim the standard deduction in a carry- over year, or Become a widow or widower. Because of their complexity and the limited number of taxpayers to whom these additional rules apply, they aren't discussed in this publi- cation. If you need to figure a carryover and you are in one of these situations, you may want to consult with a tax practitioner. Substantiation Requirements You must keep records to prove the amount of the contributions you make during the year. The kind of records you must keep depends on the amount of your contributions and whether they are: Cash contributions, Noncash contributions, or Out-of-pocket expenses when donating your services.Page 18 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Page 18 Publication 526 (2022)Note. An organization must generally give you a written statement if it receives a payment from you that is more than $75 and is partly a contribution and partly for goods or services. (See Contributions From Which You Benefit un- der Contributions You Can Deduct , earlier.) Keep the statement for your records. It may sat- isfy all or part of the recordkeeping require- ments explained in the following discussions. Cash Contributions Cash contributions include payments made by cash, check, electronic funds transfer, online payment service, debit card, credit card, payroll deduction, or a transfer of a gift card redeema- ble for cash. You can't deduct a cash contribution, re- gardless of the amount, unless you keep one of the following. 1.A bank record that shows the name of the qualified organization, the date of the con- tribution, and the amount of the contribu- tion. Bank records may include: a.A canceled check. b.A bank or credit union statement. c.A credit card statement. d.An electronic fund transfer receipt. e.A scanned image of both sides of a canceled check obtained from a bank or credit union website. 2.A receipt (or a letter or other written com- munication such as an email) from the qualified organization showing the name of the organization, the date of the contri- bution, and the amount of the contribution. 3.The payroll deduction records described next. Payroll deductions. If you make a contribu- tion by payroll deduction, you must keep: 1.A pay stub, Form W-2, or other document furnished by your employer that shows the date and amount of the contribution; and 2.A pledge card or other document prepared by or for the qualified organization that shows the name of the organization and states the organization doesn't provide goods or services in return for any contri- bution made to it by payroll deduction. If your employer withheld $250 or more from a single paycheck, see Contributions of $250 or More next. Contributions of $250 or More You can claim a deduction for a contribution of $250 or more only if you have a contemporane- ous written acknowledgment of your contribu- tion from the qualified organization or certain payroll deduction records. See Contemporane- ous written acknowledgment (CWA) , later, for a description of when a written acknowledgement is considered \"contemporaneous\" with your contribution. If you made more than one contribution of $250 or more, you must have either a separate acknowledgment for each or one acknowledg- ment that lists each contribution and the date of each contribution and shows your total contri- butions. Amount of contribution. In figuring whether your contribution is $250 or more, don't com- bine separate contributions. For example, if you gave your church $25 each week, your weekly payments don't have to be combined. Each payment is a separate contribution. If contributions are made by payroll deduc- tion, the deduction from each paycheck is trea- ted as a separate contribution. If you made a payment that is partly for goods and services, as described earlier under Contributions From Which You Benefit , your contribution is the amount of the payment that is more than the value of the goods and services. Acknowledgment. The acknowledgment must meet these tests. 1.It must be written. 2.It must include: a.The amount of cash you contributed, b.Whether the qualified organization gave you any goods or services as a result of your contribution (other than certain token items and membership benefits), c.A description and good faith estimate of the value of any goods or services described in (b). If the only benefit you received was an intangible religious benefit (such as admission to a reli- gious ceremony) that generally isn't sold in a commercial transaction out- side the donative context, the ac- knowledgement must say so and doesn't need to describe or estimate the value of the benefit. If the acknowledgment doesn't show the date of the contribution, you must also have a bank record or receipt, as described earlier, that does show the date of the contribution. If the acknowledgment shows the date of the contri- bution and meets the other tests just described, you don't need any other records. Contemporaneous written acknowledgment (CWA). Organizations typically send written acknowledgements to donors no later than Jan- uary 31 of the year following the donation. For the written acknowledgement to be considered contemporaneous with the contribution it must meet both of the following requirements. 1.Meet all the tests described under Ac- knowledgment , earlier; and 2.You must get it on or before the earlier of: a.The date you file your return for the year you make the contribution; or b.The due date, including extensions, for filing the return. Payroll deductions. If you make a contribu- tion by payroll deduction and your employer withholds $250 or more from a single paycheck, you must keep:1.A pay stub, Form W-2, or other document furnished by your employer that shows the amount withheld as a contribution; and 2.A pledge card or other document prepared by or for the qualified organization that shows the name of the organization and states the organization doesn't provide goods or services in return for any contri- bution made to it by payroll deduction. A single pledge card may be kept for all contri- butions made by payroll deduction regardless of amount as long as it contains all the required information. If the pay stub, Form W -2, pledge card, or other document doesn't show the date of the contribution, you must have another document that does show the date of the contribution. If the pay stub, Form W -2, pledge card, or other document shows the date of the contribution, you don't need any other records except those just described in (1) and (2). Noncash Contributions Substantiation requirements for contributions not made in cash depend on whether your de- duction for the contribution is: 1.Less than but not not more than $5,000, or 4.Over $5,000. The substantiation requirements for non- cash contributions of more than $500 also apply to any return filed for any carryover year. Amount of deduction. In figuring whether your deduction is $500 or more, combine your claimed deductions for all similar items of prop- erty donated to any qualified organization dur- ing the year. If you received goods or services in return, as described earlier in Contributions From Which You Benefit , reduce your contribution by the value of those goods or services. If you fig- ure your deduction by reducing the FMV of the donated property by its appreciation, as descri- bed earlier in Giving Property That Has In- creased in Value , your contribution is the re- duced amount. Deductions of Less Than $250 Except as provided below, no deduction will be allowed for a noncash contribution of less than $250 unless you get and keep a receipt from the qualified organization showing: 1.The name and address of the qualified or- ganization to which you contributed; 2.The date and location of the charitable contribution; 3.A description of the property in sufficient detail under the circumstances (taking into account the value of the property) for a person not generally familiar with the type of property to understand that the descrip- tion is of the contributed property; and 4.For a security, the name of the issuer, the type of security, and whether it is publicly Page 19 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Publication 526 (2022) Page 19traded as of the date of the contribution. For example, a security is generally con- sidered to be publicly traded if the security is (a) listed on a recognized stock ex- change whose quotations are published daily, (b) regularly traded on a national or regional over-the-counter market, or (c) quoted daily in a national newspaper of general circulation in the case of mutual fund shares. A letter or other written communication from the qualified organization acknowledging receipt of the contribution and containing the information in (1), (2), (3), and (4) will serve as a receipt. If it is impractical to get a receipt (for exam- ple, if you leave property at a charity's unatten- ded drop site), you may satisfy the substantia- tion requirements by maintaining reliable written records for each item of the donated property. Your reliable written records must include the following information. 1.The information in (1), (2), (3), and (4) above. 2.If you claim a deduction for clothing or a household item, a description of the condi- tion of the clothing or item. 3.The FMV of the property at the time of the contribution and how you figured the FMV. Deductions of at Least $250 but Not More Than $500 If you claim a deduction of at least $250 but not more than $500 for a noncash charitable contri- bution, you must get and keep a contemporane- ous written acknowledgment of your contribu- tion from the qualified organization. If you made more than one contribution of $250 or more, you must have either a separate acknowledg- ment for each or one acknowledgment that shows your total contributions. See CWA , ear- lier. The acknowledgment must: 1.Be written. 2.Include: a.A description (but not necessarily the value) of any property you contrib- uted, b.Whether the qualified organization gave you any goods or services as a result of your contribution (other than certain token items and membership benefits), and c.A description and good faith estimate of the value of any goods or services described in (b). If the only benefit you received was an intangible religious benefit (such as admission to a reli- gious ceremony) that generally isn't sold in a commercial transaction out- side the donative context, the ac- knowledgment must say so and doesn't need to describe or estimate the value of the benefit. 3.Be received by you on or before the earlier of:a.The date you file your return for the year you make the contribution, or b.The due date, including extensions, for filing the return. Deductions Over $500 but Not Over $5,000 If you claim a deduction over $500 but not over $5,000 for a noncash charitable contribution, you must complete Form 8283 and have the CWA , earlier. Your completed Form 8283 must include: 1.Your name and taxpayer identification number, 2.The name and address of the qualified or- ganization, 3.The date of the charitable contribution, and 4.The following information about the con- tributed property: a.A description of the property in suffi- cient detail under the circumstances (taking into account the value of the property) for a person not generally familiar with the type of property to un- derstand that the description is of the contributed property; b.The FMV of the property on the contri- bution date and the method used in figuring the FMV; c.In the case of real or tangible prop- erty, its condition; d.In the case of tangible personal prop- erty, whether the donee has certified it for a use related to the purpose or function constituting the donee's ba- sis for exemption under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code or, in the case of a governmental unit, an exclusively public purpose; e.In the case of securities, the name of the issuer, the type of securities, and whether they were publicly traded as of the date of the contribution; f.How you got the property, for exam- ple, by purchase, gift, bequest, inheri- tance, or exchange; g.The approximate date you got the property or, if created, produced, or manufactured by or for you, the ap- proximate date the property was sub- stantially completed; and h.The cost or other basis, and any ad- justments to the basis, of property held less than 12 months and, if avail- able, the cost or other basis of prop- erty held 12 months or more. This re- quirement, however, doesn't apply to publicly traded securities. Deductions Over $5,000 If you claim a deduction of over $5,000 for a noncash charitable contribution, you must have the CWA , earlier, obtain a qualified written ap- praisal of the donated property from a qualified appraiser, and complete Form 8283. A qualified appraisal is not required for contributions of qualified vehicles for which you obtain a CWA, certain inventory, publicly traded securities, or certain intellectual property. See Deductions of More Than $5,000 in Pub. 561 for more infor- mation. In addition to, or in lieu of, the items descri- bed in Deductions Over $500 but Not Over $5,000 earlier, your completed Form include: 1.The qualified organization's taxpayer iden- tification number, signature, the date signed by the qualified organization, and the date the qualified organization re- ceived the property; 2.The appraiser's name, address, taxpayer identification number, appraiser declara- tion, signature, and the date signed by the appraiser; and 3.The following additional information about the contributed property: a.The FMV on the valuation effective date; and b.A statement explaining whether the charitable contribution was made by means of a bargain sale and, if so, the amount of any consideration received for the contribution. Note. The appraiser declaration must in- clude the following statement: \"I understand that my appraisal will be used in connection with a return or claim for refund. I also under- stand that, if there is a substantial or gross valu- ation misstatement of the value of the property claimed on the return or claim for refund that is based on my appraisal, I may be subject to a penalty under section 6695A of the Internal Revenue Code, as well as other applicable pen- alties. I affirm that I have not been at any time in the 3 -year period ending on the date of the ap- praisal barred from presenting evidence or testi- mony before the Department of the Treasury or the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 330(c).\" Qualified Conservation Contribution If the contribution was a qualified conservation contribution, your records must also include the FMV of the underlying property before and after the contribution and the conservation purpose furthered by the contribution. For more information, see Qualified Conser- vation Contribution , earlier, and in Pub. 561. Out-of-Pocket Expenses If you give services to a qualified organization and have unreimbursed out -of-pocket expen- ses, considered separately, of $250 or more (for example, you pay $250 for an airline ticket to attend a convention of a qualified organiza- tion as a chosen representative), related to those services, the following two rules apply. 1.You must have adequate records to prove the amount of the expenses.Page 20 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Page 20 Publication 526 (2022)2.You must get an acknowledgment from the qualified organization that contains: a.A description of the services you pro- vided, b.A statement of whether or not the or- ganization provided you any goods or services to reimburse you for the ex- penses you incurred, c.A description and a good faith esti- mate of the value of any goods or services (other than intangible reli- gious benefits) provided to reimburse you, and d.A statement that the only benefit you received was an intangible religious benefit, if that was the case. The ac- knowledgment doesn't need to de- scribe or estimate the value of an in- tangible religious benefit (defined earlier under Acknowledgment ). You must get the acknowledgment on or before the earlier of: 1.The date you file your return for the year you make the contribution, or 2.The due date, including extensions, for fil- ing the return. Car expenses. If you claim expenses directly related to use of your car in giving services to a qualified organization, you must keep reliable written records of your expenses. Whether your records are considered reliable depends on all the facts and circumstances. Generally, they may be considered reliable if you made them regularly and at or near the time you had the ex- penses. For example, your records might show the name of the organization you were serving and the dates you used your car for a charitable pur- pose. If you use the standard mileage rate of 14 cents a mile, your records must show the miles you drove your car for the charitable purpose. If you deduct your actual expenses, your records must show the costs of operating the car that are directly related to a charitable purpose. See Car expenses under Out-of- Pocket Ex- penses in Giving Services , earlier, for the ex- penses you can deduct. How To Report Report your charitable contributions on Sched- ule A (Form 1040), lines 11 through 14. If you made noncash contributions, you may also be required to fill out parts of Form 8283. See Noncash contributions , later. Cash contributions and out -of-pocket ex- penses. Enter your cash contributions, includ- ing out -of-pocket expenses, on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 11. Reporting expenses for student living with you. If you claim amounts paid for a stu- dent who lives with you, as described earlier un- der Expenses Paid for Student Living With You , you must submit with your return:1.A copy of your agreement with the organi- zation sponsoring the student placed in your household, 2.A summary of the various items you paid to maintain the student, and 3.A statement that gives: a.The date the student became a mem- ber of your household, b.The dates of his or her full-time at- tendance at school, and c.The name and location of the school. Noncash contributions. Enter your noncash contributions on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 12. Total deduction over $500. If your total deduction for all noncash contributions for the year is over $500, you must complete Form 8283 and attach it to your Form 1040. Use Sec- tion A of Form 8283 to report noncash contribu- tions for which you claimed a deduction of $5,000 or less per item (or group of similar items). Also use Section A to report contribu- tions of publicly traded securities. See Deduc- tion over $5,000 next, for the items you must re- port on Section B. The IRS may disallow your deduction for noncash charitable contributions if it is more than $500 and you don't submit Form 8283 with your return. Deduction over $5,000. You must com- plete Section B of Form 8283 for each item or group of similar items for which you claim a de- duction of over $5,000. (However, if you con- tributed publicly traded securities, complete Section A instead.) In figuring whether your de- duction for a group of similar items was more than $5,000, consider all items in the group, even if items in the group were donated to more than one organization. However, you must file a separate Form 8283, Section B, for each organ- ization. The organization that received the prop- erty must complete and sign Part V of Sec- tion B. Vehicle donations. If you donated a car, boat, airplane, or other vehicle, you may have to attach a copy of Form 1098 -C (or other state- ment) to your return. For details, see Cars, Boats, and Airplanes , earlier. Clothing and household items not in good used condition. You must include with your return a Qualified appraisal , which is pre- pared by a Qualified appraiser , of any single do- nated item of clothing or any donated house- hold item that isn't in good used condition or better and for which you deduct more than $500. See Clothing and Household Items , ear- lier. Qualified appraisal. A qualified appraisal is an appraisal document that: Is made, signed, and dated by a qualified appraiser (defined later) in accordance with generally accepted appraisal stand- ards; Meets the relevant requirements of Regu- lations section 1.170A-17(a);Has a valuation effective date no earlier than 60 days before the date of the contri- bution and no later than the date of the contribution. For an appraisal report dated on or after the date of the contribution, the valuation effective date must be the date of the contribution; and Does not involve a prohibited appraisal fee. You must receive the qualified appraisal be- fore the due date, including extensions, of the return on which a charitable contribution deduc- tion is first claimed for the donated property. If the deduction is first claimed on an amended return, the qualified appraisal must be received before the date on which the amended return is filed. Qualified appraiser. A qualified appraiser is an individual with verifiable education and ex- perience in valuing the type of property for which the appraisal is performed. 1.The individual: a.Has earned an appraisal designation from a generally recognized profes- sional appraiser organization, or b.Has met certain minimum education requirements and 2 or more years of experience. To meet the minimum ed- ucation requirement, the individual must have successfully completed professional or college-level course- work obtained from: i.A professional or college-level educational organization, ii.A professional trade or appraiser organization that regularly offers educational programs in valuing the type of property, or iii.An employer as part of an em- ployee apprenticeship or educa- tion program similar to professio- nal or college-level courses. 2.The individual regularly prepares apprais- als for which he or she is paid. 3.The individual is not an excluded individ- ual. See Pub. 561 for more information. Easement on building in historic district. If you claim a deduction for a qualified conser- vation contribution for an easement on the exte- rior of a building in a registered historic district, you must include a qualified appraisal (defined earlier), photographs, and certain other informa- tion with your return. See Qualified Conserva- tion Contribution , earlier. Deduction over $500,000. If you claim a deduction of more than $500,000 for a contribu- tion of property, you must attach a Qualified ap- praisal , which is prepared by a Qualified ap- praiser , of the property to your return. This doesn't apply to contributions of cash, qualified vehicles for which you obtained a CWA , certain inventory, publicly traded securities, or intellec- tual property. See Regulations section 1.170A-16(e)(2). In figuring whether your deduction is over $500,000, combine the claimed deductions for Page 21 of 25 Fileid: ... tions/p526/2022/a/xml/cycle10/source 13:22 - 13-Feb-2023 The type and rule above prints on all proofs including departmental reproduction proofs. MUST be removed before printing. Publication 526 (2022) Page 21all similar items donated to any qualified organi- zation during the year. If you don't attach the appraisal, you can't deduct your contribution, unless your failure to attach it is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect. Form 8282. An organization must file Form 8282 if, within 3 years of receiving property for which it was required to sign a Form 8283, it sells, exchanges, consumes, or otherwise dis- poses of the property. The organization must also send you a copy of the form. However, the organization need not file Form 8282 to report the sale of an item if you signed a statement on Section B of Form 8283 stating that the ap- praised value of the item, or a specific item within a group of similar items, was $500 or less. For this purpose, all shares of nonpublicly traded stock or securities, or items that form a set (such as a collection of books written by the same author or a group of place settings), are considered to be one item.

Reporting and resolving your tax -related identity theft issues. Tax-related identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information to commit tax fraud. Your taxes can be af- fected if your SSN is used to file a fraudu- lent return or to claim a refund or credit. The IRS doesn't initiate contact with tax- payers by email, text messages (including shortened links), telephone calls, or social media channels to request or verify per- sonal or financial information. This in- cludes requests for personal identification numbers (PINs), passwords, or similar in- formation for credit cards, banks, or other financial accounts. Go to IRS.gov/IdentityTheft , the IRS Iden- tity Theft Central webpage, for information on identity theft and data security protec- tion for taxpayers, tax professionals, and businesses. If your SSN has been lost or stolen or you suspect you're a victim of tax-related identity theft, you can learn what steps you should take. Get an Identity Protection PIN (IP PIN). IP PINs are six-digit numbers assigned to tax- payers to help prevent the misuse of their SSNs on fraudulent federal income tax re- turns. When you have an IP PIN, it pre- vents someone else from filing a tax return with your SSN. To learn more, go to IRS.gov/IPPIN . Ways to check on the status of your refund. Go to IRS.gov/Refunds . Download the official IRS2Go app to your mobile device to check your refund status. Call the automated refund hotline at 800-829-1954. Note. The IRS can't issue refunds before mid- February for returns that claimed the EIC or the additional child tax credit (ACTC). This ap- plies to the entire refund, not just the portion as- sociated with these credits. Making a tax payment. Go to IRS.gov/ Payments for information on how to make a payment using any of the following options. IRS Direct Pay : Pay your individual tax bill or estimated tax payment directly from your checking or savings account at no cost to you.
