Therefore, before we make any decision, let us explore more about the Megadose Therapy together. What is Megadose? Megadose is ascorbic acid also known as vitamin C administered through the intravenous route at a dosage of 25-75 grams. It is a form of targeted treatment that has been proven to eliminate cancerous cells for all cancer patients. Studies have shown that cancerous cells differ from normal cells for the following reasons: - Unable to use oxygen to convert glucose into energy. - Lack catalase enzyme and therefore cannot change hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into water and oxygen (as shown in figure below). High-dosage vitamin C (Megadose) will result in hydrogen peroxide as free radicals which are toxic to cancerous cells. Therefore, Megadose can destroy these cells without harming normal cells that contain catalase enzyme. Benefits of Megadose There have been several studies on the use of high-dosage vitamin C in cancer treatment since 1970. Clinical research studies have found the following: - High-dosage vitamin C prevented metastasis and the growth of cancerous cells for prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, brain cancer and other types of cancer. - The use of high-dosage vitamin C in conjunction with certain types of chemotherapy and radiotherapy yielded greater efficacy than using chemotherapy alone to eliminate cancerous cells for ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and brain cancer. There are several human studies on the positive effects of high-dose vitamin C done by Linus Pauling, PhD and Hugh Riordan, MD. In addition, many researchers have also found that high-dosage vitamin C have many other benefits and they are as follows: - Yielding good results for cancer therapy both by using the vitamin alone and in conjunction with other types of therapy - Helping to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy - Helping to increase the survival rates for cancer patients and improve their quality of life These studies have been approved by the National Institute of Health of the United States (NIH) and the National Cancer Institute of the United States (NCI). Side effects, risks and advice The use of high-dosage vitamin C has very few side-effects according to clinical studies. However, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD Deficiency), are advised to avoid high-dosage vitamin C as this may cause the red blood cells to rupture. In addition, patients with kidney disease or kidney failure should also avoid this therapy as it may cause kidney stone disease. Apart from that, patients are normally advised to have plenty of water (approximately 1.5 - 2 liters per day) during and after the Megadose therapy. "}
