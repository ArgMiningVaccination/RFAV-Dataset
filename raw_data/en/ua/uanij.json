Dear friends, Happy Spring, Happy Easter, and to our friends celebrating Passover, we wish you a meaningful Seder! As the day lengthens and the light moves higher in the heavens, the earth springs to life- in birdsong, budding leaves and flowers, busy bees- all beckoning us to crawl out of our caves to come greet the world.

Featured Articles Reimagining Health and Wealth by John Bloom As young children, my brother and I would visit our grandmother at the home for the aged. She would look at us and say, even into her nineties, \"If you are healthy, you are wealthy.\" That was a first mysterious inkling of how simple wisdom connects apparent disparity.

He was best known for his accomplishment as a savvy book publisher and later as the leader of Steiner books. He used this platform to inspire people all over the world to share their work, especially if it entailed a pursuit of spiritual knowledge and doing good for others. His life and work embody the theme of this newsletter: \"Helping Ourselves through helping Others\" and was part of the inspiration for this issue. Gene had great hope for the future of Anthroposophic and Holistic Medicine. He helped publish many, many books. We would discuss this topic over lunch the year before his passing. He was always encouraging about the potential future of the Foundation for Health Creation and about inspiring the world about Anthroposophic and Integrative Medicine, even how these forms of medicine could be more radically transformed to help advance our understanding of health in the future.
